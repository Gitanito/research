NEW PREFACE.
A r.t'r'rr..': previously to the time when the following work was commenced, the
Author had made arrangements for a
journey to Egypt and Asia, alluded to in the note
to Chapter IV. Section xx.; but circumstances caused the plan to be abandoned. After
th work was begun, the scheme was revived, and the following spring fixed for com-
e
mencing the journey, from which it might have happened that the Author did not return.
In consequence of these circumstances, the book (which was first intended as a small
octavo, and bv degrees had grown into a
large quarto) was much hurried, both in the
d l
'
h
composing and printing, seven months only being allowed for the whole; an tus t e
Author hopes will be some apology for the list of errata. As it turned out, the haste
was unnecessary, as about the time for commencing his journey the Author's oriental
travelling companion died, and the journey was put oH` for ever.
As might be expected of such a work, it has been attacked from various quarters,
and in various ways; but it is gratifying to the Author to have it in his power to say,
that no error of any importance has been pointed out, nor have any of the great principles
laid down in his argument, or casually introduced in the progress ot' the work, been
attacked with the slightest success.
Such attacks as are deserving notice, the Author flatters himself will be fully reiirted
in a work which he is now
preparing for the press; in which the extraordinary race, the
Buddhists of upper India, (of whom the Phoenician Canaanite, Melchizedek, was a
priest,) who built the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Carnac, 8:c., will be shewn to have founded
all the ancient Mythologies of the world, which, however varied and corrupted in recent
times, were originally ouz, and that ous founded on principles sublime, beautiful, and
true.
The Author feels himself under no
obligation to answer anonymous writers; but
he thinks it proper to notice very shortly some observations by a
gentleman who, the
th l b`t of writin things to which he is ashamed to put his
Author believes, is not in e la | g _
k call d Hermes Britan-
name. The Rev. W. L. Bowles, at the end of his learned wor e
nicus, has taken up the defence of the order of Priests, of which the Author's censure
seems to have given great oE`ence; the priests of every sect, as far as the Author can
'
th
perceive, being offended only because the order of his own sect is not excepted from e
condemnation of priesthoods generally throughout the world, of ancient and modern
times. Mr. Bowles observes, that the examples of Cranmer and Calvin :land as indivi-
duals in the black calendar; to which, in reply, the Author begs leave to ask him, whe-
ther, when in one instance Calvinordered green wood for the purpose of burning his
victim-and when, in the other, the Protestant-Papist-Protestant Cranmer, compelled
Q 0 I
*br
the weeping infant Edward to sign the warrant for buming the infant Joan Boacher(
they were both under age)-the priests of their respective sects did not stand by and blow
NEW PREFACE.
the tires? If they did not, where are their protests against these atrocities? Where is
the act of convocation condemning them? The Author can find no public act of priests
any where against them; but in his search for this saving clause he did find an act
of the Assembly of the Calvinistic Church of Scotland, confessing as A car-:ar zu-
rrosar. sm the act of the British Parliament abolishing the burning and hanging of
witches.
But so far were the priests of the Protestant sects from condemning these atrocities,
that the Genevans were congratulated and praised by almost all the Protestant churches
on the continent for buming Servetus; and the act of Cranmer was imitated in the time
of the Protestant James the First, by the burning of one poor wretch at Lichfield, and
another at Smithfield, viz. B. Legatt and E. Wightman, with all the old regular and
hypocritical tbrrns of deliverance up to the secular power by the bishop. As long as an
orthodox order (that is, the order of a sect possessing the power of the sword) charges
crimes of this nature against other sects as reasons for denying to them the possession
of their civil rights, their own crimes can neither be forgotten nor forgiven. Nor will
the Author be deterred by the foolish charge of bad taste from exerting his feeble efforts
to keep this encroaching order in its proper place.-If these statements give offence,
they must be attributed to those who, by insinuating that the Author forgot the ninth
commandment, put him in his own defence to the necessity of making them.
But the Author thinks that when the Canon of Salisbury was quoting so largely
ti-om his book, he would have done nothing unfair if he had noticed the Author's admis-
sion in the preceding page, that the Protestant priesthood of England was the only one
in the world which had not been a curse to its country.
The Author has most distinctly admitted, and will most cheertiilly repeat his ad-
mission, that in every class of priests (but he will not limit it to any one sect) great
numbers of excellent men are to be found; but again he says, that the order is not a
necessary appendage to Christianity, and, as an order considered, throughout the world,
from the beginning of time, it has been more prejudicial than beneficial to mankind.
And, in opposition to the Canon of Salisbury, he takes the liberty of saying, that "
if
the Melancthons, the Bowleses, and the Bucers, had been three times as numerous as
they have been, they would not have destroyed the general nature of the rule." In
all priesthoods, men in humble life, by their good conduct, have acquired power to
the order: this once acquired, its members, with the acquisition of wealth and power,
have become corrupted. It is only a consequence flowing from the nature of things;
and all patriotic priests ought to assist the feeble eB'orts of the Author to keep their
1~ar.acn~r.rv1No, axrnnozrrnc order in its proper place. Let them remember that
their Master was never entlzroned, nor did he live in a
palace. And to excuse the acqui-
sition of these pomps and vanities to themselves by saying, that they are to do honour to
him who forbade them, is but to insult him.
January, 1829.
PREFACE.
UPoN reviewing what I have written in the following work, it has occurred to me
that I have not said quite so much, in my first chapter, on the mode usually adopted of
transferring written accounts from one
language into another, as is expedient; I shall,
therefore, in this place, submit a few preliminary observations to my reader.
Man possesses organs of the mouth and adjoining parts, by which he produces sounds
expressive of his feelings. When these sounds become limited to certain defined, fixed
objects, and are meant to represent these objects, they are called words, and the repre-
sentations of these objects in his mind or
understanding are called ideas. Hence words
represent both the things and the ideas. Thus words are sounds significant of ideas.
Letters, in like manner, are marks formed by the mechanical powers of man to perpe-
tuate and record these sounds significant, that they may pass to others, or to
iirturity.
Now suppose a
parent state to send of colonies, but before she send them oil] that she
form a
system of letters to represent such sounds as she has found needtiil for recording
her ideas. Suppose she make A to represent the idea of unity, B to represent the idea
of two unities, D to represent the idea of four unities, and 0 to represent some other
collection of unities; and these signs also she make, when combined in various ways, to
represent the ideas of things treated of just now; for instance, that D A B should stand
tor a certain fish called a Dah. Now we will suppose a
colony to go away, and to take
this artzfcial system with them ; in all future time, when they want to represent the
word dah, and the idea of that fish, they ought to make the three signs d-a-b, and no
other; and they ought to do this if they wanted to represent the parent signs and the
idea, although they might have changed the sound given to these signs in their habits of
speaking. Should they have got into the habit of calling the A O, yet, in the case above
supposed, they ought to write dab, and not dab. The reader will observ8» that if they
A _
ii rnnucn.
wished to call the idea by a new name, or to represent the thing varied in any way, that
would be a different matter, not the case which I state. In order to make myself
understood more clearly, I repeat, as their system of mechanical signs continues the
same, they ought, when representing any word of the parent system, to make use of the
same mechanical signs. Thus for the word dab, they ought to use the letter standing
for four, or the fourth letter, that standing for one, or the first, that standing for two, or
the second; not because these letters stand for these numbers, but because these are
the corresponding letters in the parent's system and in the child's system. The use of
the numbers may assist us in finding out the corresponding letters, but the numbers
themselves have nothing to do with the reason of the matter. Now I will give an ex-
ample in a very famous word, mn* ieue, as used in the synagogue, called by us Ja.
HOYAH. If the Hebrew system be the same as the English system, when I wish to
represent this word, I ought to write the corresponding letters, and no other. If I use
other letters, for instance, add the letters ll, or v, or
j, I do not describe the same word,
whatever I may mean. If persons talk about sounds, I say sounds have nothing to do
with the case stated by me, which relates merely to the written signs. But the absur-
dity of letting supposed sounds of letters be represented, may be estimated by the follow-
ing example :-Suppose an Arab wished to write in our letters the word answering to
the idea of window of the English, would he write window with the man of Stamford, or
vinder with the man of Kent ? The reader will not forget that if the child choose to call
the dab or the ieue of its parent by an entire new name, the latter byddonai, for instance,
this is quite a diB'erent matter. In such case, as the two systems are the same, the
same letters in one ought to represent the same letters in the other; and if the child
should be found to have coined new additional mechanical signs or letters, these new
signs ought never to be used to represent words ofthe parent language, unless the parent
language have adopted signs answering to them. And suppose the parent or the child,
from any cause, should have changed the forms of its signs or letters, so long as the
system continue the same, still the same signs or letters in the one ought to represent
the same signs or letters in the other. I think no reasonable person will deny the truth
of this in the case stated, namely, where the systems continue the same. In what cases
I may prove systems to be similar is a di&`erent question, and each case must evidently
stand upon its own merits. I beg this may be well considered and not forgotten, as it
is of the first importance, not only in the following work, but in the general practice of
rendering the names or words ofone language into another.
Paenen. 53;
The reader will iind in the ensuing work that the Hebrew language, which is ofthe
Brst importance, is treated as a
language of great sirnplicityf-that its vowels are
considered precisely the same as those of the English, and of all the other languages
in the Western part of the world. But he will observe, that some words have no
vowels, and that in almost every word consonants come together without them. The
cause of this cannot at this day be certainfy known; but it may have arisen either from
a wish in the priests to conceal or render diliicult the art of reading, or merely from a
habit of abbreviating words for the sake of expedition, or of reducing works to as small
a size as possible. This was similar to a practice which took place in the Latin Ian-
guage some centuries ago, by which it would have been brought to the same situation
as the Hebrew, if it had been continued. Thus for manum, they wrote ninin,
Src., &c. In this state the Hebrew was found, when the Jews began to recover after
the ruin of their country; and, to obviate the inconvenience of it, points as vowels were
invented, instead of the vowels being restored, as they ought to have been. But nothing
simple or
plain was
likely to suit the followers of the modern cabala, the most childish
foolery that ever men of common sense permitted themselves to be deluded with. The
unleamed reader will please to observe that I am here only delivering my own opinion
of the origin and reason of this state ofthe language. The fact of its present state with-
out points in the synagogue copies is all which here concerns us, and that fact will not
be disputed.
As two consonants cannot be pronounced or understood without vowels, they must
in almost every word be supplied. Dr. Parkhurst always supplies an a or an e, ad
libitum.
I have little or no doubt, that different vowels were anciently supplied according
to what the meaning of the word required; but I think that, in order to render it more
diiiicult to understand, it may, in the very earliest times, have been constantly written
without any vowels. I am convinced that the unleamed reader will be satisfied that the
Hebrew is essentially the same as the Greek and Latin-having, like them, its five
vowels. The learned Hebraist, whose mind has been poisoned by the craft of the
synagogue, I do not expect readily to give up his prejudice in favour of unleamed sim-
plicity. But if the old men will not give up their nonsense, it will be exploded,

because the young ones will not admit it. Perhaps it will be like Mr. Fren¢I's algebra.
Some years ago he pointed out to the learned of Cambridge, that their negative quantities
in algebra were not only nonsensical and useless, but that they were
actually prejudicial
to science. Of course the learned old gentlemen would not consent to be untaught, to
unlearn, but I understand that at the Mechanics' Institutes, algebra is now
taught with-
out negative quantities.
From the circumstances above mentioned, the Hebrew language is very uncertain,
even to the best scholars, and must always continue so. My learned reader, I hope, will
excuse me for occupying his time with stating this, not for hair, but for the information of
unlearned readers, to whom I wish to make my book intelligible, which I Hatter myself
it will be, with nothing more than a little common attention. By a
very slight attention
to the tables in the first chapter, they will easily understand every thing which follows.
But they will be good enough to observe, that in page 8, at line 19, for column 9, 8tc.,
they must read ,
"
column 9 contains the names of the Celtic Irish letters, and column
10 their meanings." If the reader will apply a little close attention to the first tive short
sections to make himself acquainted with them, I apprehend without any knowledge
of either Greek or Hebrew, he will be able to comprehend the whole of the remaining
part of the work with facility.
From a circumstance which has happened, I think it necessary to observe, that I feel
a little fear lest the figures in my references should, in some few instances, be found
incorrect. But for several months past, since I have been closely engaged upon mis
work, my eyes have begun to ihil, and I have not got used to spectacles. I have forgotten
how to use
my old eyes, and have not yet learned how to use my new ones. But if my
fear should prove well founded, of this I am quite certain, that no one who knows me,
will suspect me of an intentional false quotation.
I am conscious, that a critical eye will easily discover marks of haste in this work.
It is useless to deny it. But if; as the reader will find, what is in my contemplation, be
carried into eR`ect, no time was to be lost. What will be met with in a note respecting
my future intentions, must plead my excuse. Not ten pages of this work were written
the first of last October. Except what I possessed in my own mind, the materials
collected, consisted only of a list of upwards of two hundred volumes to be read or
consulted, in most of which was to be found for my purpose Nornruc.
PREFACE. V
In a subject of this kind I have not thought it necessary to give every authority on
which my doctrines are founded, or to verify by actual examination :hose which I hav;
given. I have constantly relied on the credit of authors in whose treatises I have found
them, contenting myself with merely referring to such authors-in 'whose works the other
authorities will he found, if required. I know not the use of loading my page with notes
of unnecessary references, except I wished to make an ostentatious display ofgreat learn-
ing, to which I make no pretension. It will also be observed, that I have made free use
of the text of my predecessors. But if I have done this, I have, I believe, in every case
acknowledged the obligation, as well as the obligations to my learned friends from whom
I have received assistance. If the works of older authors are not to be used by their
successors for the ends of truth, they are of little use; they might as well be sent to the
ovens of Omar. My successors will do the same with me, if my work be good for any
thing; and they are welcome.
To certain persons who permit their bigotry to mislead their judgment, this book will be
gall and wormwood, because I have not thought proper to pander to their base passions.
But very certain I am, that much will be found in favour of rational Christianity, and not
a word against it. Though I have not been deterred from publishing deductions drawn
fairly from premises founded in what I believe to be the truth, by the fear of the bigots
of any sect, I am a little afraid, that in my anxiety to guard myself against the miscon-
structions of hot-headed ultra-pietists, above alluded to, I should sometimes have become
tedious.
It is not probable that such a work as this will pass without censure. Perhaps some
person may be found to fancy he shall get preferment by misrepresenting my words, or by
exposing my errors, for errors unquestionably must exist in such a multifarious per-
formance; I shall, therefore, prepare myselffor the publication ofa second short Appendix
in the same size as this book, and to be bound up with it, to explain the one or to correct
the other; and I shall be much obliged to any gentleman for corrections or other informa-
tion relating to my subject which he may think useiiil. But I take the liberty of saying,
that I cannot conceive it possible for any person possessing honourable intentions, to
write against me in any way without giving me information of it, or sending me a
copy
of his
publication. To attack, and not to do this, is the act of the midnight assassin.
vi PREFACE.
Whether the second Appendix here alluded to, will be delivered to the purchasers of this
volume free of expense or not, must depend on circumstances. But emolument is not
the author's object in this work.
The introduction consists merely of descriptions of the different kinds of Druidical
monuments, extracted from the works ofthe authors who appeared to have given the best
account of them.
To the officers of the British Museum, I think it right to express my acknowledge.
ments. Although I have given them great trouble, their civilityhas never failed nor their
attention wearied. BUT I always spoke to them with politeness, not as I would treat a
troublesome dog in the street. And, occasionally, I did not fail to make a reasonable
allowance for the time required and the diibculty of finding old books seldom wanted,
in a
large library without a numbered catalogue.
Of the execution of the printing, it is unnecessary to speak; it answers for itself; but
I may be permitted to thank Mr. Smalllield, of Hackney, my printer, for his business-like
punctuality and attention, and particularly for his attention to the different languages
from which I have had occasion to quote.
The lithographic part, I think, will be allowed to do credit to Mr. Day, and to Mons.
Hadge, his promising young artist, by whom I have no doubt that this infant beautifiil
art will soon be brought to rival the finest engraving.

STONEHENGE.
l_,,1i.>l.
THE following Description of STONEHEN GE and of most of the Plates is taken from
the Hilrtor-_y of Wiltshire by Srn Rrcr-:ann Cor.: Hoans, Baronet, with a
slight
Iteration in the description in consequence of Mr. W.u.rran's plan being substituted
a 1
tor that of Inigo Jones, which is universally allowed to be very erroneous. No labour
or
expense seems to have been spared by Sir R. C. Hoare to obtain, in every respect,
the greatest possible accuracy.
Srounuuscz. The construction and plan of this building are of so novel and singular a.
nature, that no verbal description, though drawn up by the ablest writer, can possibly convey to

competent idea of it. If I talk to you of aDoric, Ionic, or orm mn

will readil form such an idea of the building in your mind, as not to be surprised on
seeing it ; for

description would prove very unsatisfactory. The pen, therefore, must call in the assistance of the
pencil- for without a reference to plans and views, no
perfect knowledge can be gained respecting
I
thi "W der of the West." In the plans now presented to you, I have endeavoured to
s on
correct the errors of others, and, by the assistance of an able surveyor, repeated visits, and
a strict attention to accuracy, to render them as complete as the great xntricacy of the subject
will admit.

shall have occasion to mention hereafter, I have reason to agree with Srnxsasv, in thinking it s mark

have their ditches on the outside of the bank, an we had in all the strong camps upon our hills.
B
ii STONEHENGE-DESCRIPTION or stares.
this whole line of circumvallation was a very slight work. Adjoining the agger, within the area,
is a large prostrate stone, which has given rise to various opinions; the most prevailing of which
is, that it was the stone on which the victims were
slaughtered; but all these hypotheses are
completely overturned by the circumstances of three sides of the stone bearing the same mark
of tools as the large uprights of the temple, and the projecting part of the base, where it rested on
the ground, remaining in its rude state, and unhewn; the fourth side, being uppermost, has been
much defaced and excavated by the continual effect of water on it for a
long succession of years.
This we proved by digging so completely under it, as to he able to examine the undermost side of
the stone, where we found fragments of stags' horns. This stone measures in length twenty-one
feet two inches, of which three feet, six inches being under ground, the height of the stone,
I
when upright, was seventeen feet, eight inches. The distance from the first stone in the avenue
b h d ed f d the distance
to the second stone at the entrance into the area, was a out one un r eet, an
between that and the outside of the stone circle, was nearly the same. The distance from the
valium to the temple is also one hundred feet, as well as the inner diameter of the temple; so that
the Britons seemed partial to the proportion of one hundred feet, having adopted it in so many
important parts of their building.
There are two small stones wi e v , j ,
satisfactorily defined. The one on the South-east aide is near nine feet high, and has fallen on
its base backwards on the valium: the other on the North-west side is not quite four feet high;
both rude and unhewn. There are also two small tumuli ditched round, so as to resemble exca-
vations, adjoining the agger; they are very lightly elevated above the surface, and deserve parti-
cular notice, as they may give rise to some curious and not improbable conjectures. Dr. Stukeley
supposes them to have been the places where two stone vases were set; and the stones before
mentioned to have been two altars for some particular rites, which he does not, however, take
upon himself to explain. Here our learned Doctor gets out of his depth, as do others, who sup-
pose these cavities to have been destined to hold the blood of victims. On minute investigation
you will plainly see, that the valium of the agger surrounding the work has been evidently cur-
tailed, by forming the tumulus on the North-west side of the circle, which induced us to open it;
when, much to our surprise, we found within it a
simple interment of burned bones; from
whence we may fairly infer, that this sepulchral barrow existed on the Plain, I will not venture
to say before the construction of Stonehenge, but probably before the ditch was thrown up; and
I scarcely know how we can separate the sera of the one from the other. We also opened the
other tumulus on the South-east side, but found nothing in it. You will perceive that I have
marked only one adit to the temple on my plan; for I am satisfied with Stukeley, that the other
two supposed entrances are modem works, and made by the frequent intercourse of carriages.

The plate No. 2, represents a ground~plan of the Temple, divested of all its appendages. To
fm those that remain in their
render it more intelligible, I have distinguished the fallen stones rn
original position, by representing the former as prostrate, and by engraving the latter with a
darker stroke, and aa, hitherto, the trilithona or imposts have never been represented in any plan,
I have thought it to insert those that remain; but I beg it may be understood, that by so doing,
I have been obliged to deviate a little from true perspective, as, if drawn to a scale with the rest of
the stones, they would totally cover the uprights on which they rest.
Let us now approach this mysterious building, and enter within its hallowed precincts.
"When you enter the building," says Stukeley, "whether on foot or horseback, and cast your
STONEHENGE--DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. ill
eyes around upon the yawning ruins, you are struck into an extatic reverie, which none can
describe, and they only can be sensible of, that feel it. Other buildings fall by piecemeal; but
here a
single stone is a ruin, and lies like the haughty carcase of Goliath. Yet there is as much
of it undemolished, as enables us
sumciently to recover its form, when it was in its most perfect
state: there is enough of every part to preserve the idea of the whole. When we advance further,
the dark part of the ponderous imposts over our heads, the chasm of sky between the jambs of the
Cell, the odd construction of the whole, and the greatness of every part, surprises. We may well
cry out in the poet's words, 'Tantum religio potuit !' Ifyou look upon the perfect part, you fancy
entire quarries mounted up into the air; if upon the rude havock below, you see, as it were, the
bowels of a mountain turned inside outwards." At irst sight all is amazement and confusion; the
eye is surprised, the mind bewildered. The stones begin now," and not before, to assume their
proper grandeur, and the interior of the temple, hitherto blinded by an imiform exterior, displays a
most singular variety and gigantic magnificence. But such is the dilapidation, and such the con-
fusion of the displaced fragments, that no one who has not, as I may say, got the plan by heart,
can possibly replace them in imagination according to their original destination. To obviate these
difficulties and assist the antiquary in developing this labyrinth of Stones, I have annexed a cor-
rect plan of them as they now stand, which would be rendered more
perspicuous at iirst.sight, if
each circle as well as oval, were distinguished by a
separate colour.
The Temple consists of two circles and two ovals ; the two latter constituting the Cell or Sanctum.
The outward circle, about three hundred feet in circumference, is composed of huge upright stones,
hearing others over them which form a kind of nrchitrave. Though they evidently shew the mark
of tools, they are still irregular in their forms and sizes. The height of the stones on each side the
entrance is a little more than thirteen feet, and the breadth of one, seven feet, and of the other six
feet, four inches: the impost over them is about two feet, eight inches deep. The space between
the stones in this outward circle varies; that between the entrance stones is iive feet, and rather
wider than the rest. This circle consisted originally of thirty stones, of which seventeen still
remain standing. At the distance of eight feet, three inches* from the inside of this outward circle,
we ind another composed of smaller stones, rude and irregular in their shapes. Dr. Stukeley is
certainly accurate in his conjectures, when, contrary to the opinion of preceding writers, he states
the number of stones of which this circle consisted to be forty, and not thirty. This fact may be
satisfactorily proved by measuring the space occupied by the stones belonging to this circle, No.
17, 18, 19, 20, which stand, as well as No. l, nearly in their original position, and by which it will
be clearly seen, that the number of the whole circle must have been forty. Some few particularl-
ties in this circle deserve notice. Dr. Slukeley in his ground-plan of Stonehenge has placed the
two stones at the entrance into this circle, No. 1 and 20, a little withzh the range of the others,
observing,
"
that the two stones of the principal entrance of this circle, correspondent to that of the
outward circle, are broader and taller, and set at a
greater distance from each other, being rather
more than that of the principal entrance in the outer circle. It is evident, too, that they are set
somewhat more inward than the rest; so-as that their outward face stands in the line that marks
the inner circumference of the inner circle." This remark is just, hut the lines are rather exag~
°
I have taken this measurement across from No. -1, to the South-east side of the temple, where the stones still remain
in their original position; but this inner circle is not placed exactly in the centre between the trililhons of the outward
and inner circle, as the distance between No. 4 and B l, is ten feet, four inches.

ten feet; No. 18, nine feet; and No. 17, eight feet, eight inches. No. 2, appears to have e
onged
to this circle and to have been the impost of a small trilithon. Might there not have been another
!
in the vacant space on the opposite side to correspond with it! Of this circle, originally consisting
of forty stones, traces remain only of twenty; and it is rather doubtful whether No. 15, belonged to
it, being so far removed out of its line; but from the circumstance of its being a very rude stone,
and those of the inner oval in general being better shaped, l am inclined to think it is properly
numbered on our Plan.
We now come to the grandest part of our Temple, the Cell or Sanctum ; in forming which, the
general plan has been varied; for this inner temple represents two-thirds of a large oval, and a
omitant small oval as in the outward temple we lind a large and a small circle. The large
conc ,
oval is formed by live pair of trilithons, or two large upright stones, with a third laid over them as
an impost. The placing of the imposts is also varied, for they are not continued all round, as in
the outward circle, but are divided into pairs, thereby giving a great lightness to the work, and
breaking its uniformity; neither are they like those of the outward circle, parallel at the top; but
they rise gradually in height from East to West, as will he seen by the following admeasurement:

are enabled to ascertain how deep they were Exed in the ground, and in what manner. A rude
projecting portion of the stone was left at its base, by which it was secured in the soil, and small
fragments of stone and pounded chalk were rammed in to steady it. This fallen stone is broken
in two pieces; one fragment measures twelve feet, four inches; the other nine feet, live inches, and
the part sunk in the ground four feet, six inches-making a. total height of twenty-six feet, three
inches- so that Stukeley errs in making their length thirty feet. The impost of trilithon E
I
measures sixteen feet, four inches in length; the distance between the mortises being nine feet,
seven inches. The impost belonging to this trilithon (D 3, likewise prostrate,) was hlteen feet, six
inches long. The present age has to lament the fall of trilithon E, which took place on the 3d of
January, 1797!
"

One of these uprights measures twenty-one feet, four inches, and the other twenty-one feet, three
inches; deducting from which four feet, or rather more, the length under ground, we still lind this
pair of trilithons correspond with those opposite C l, as we End also the trxhthon F 2, now stand-

=rtist's cye, from its singular position and hold tenon, forms one of the most picturesque features of
the building, by breaking the uniformity of the upright lines :
"
Jam jam lapsura cadentique
lunmiuct assiu.iilir."
It is also singular how, with such a vast projection, and the bearing of only four feet and a half
in the ground, it should so long have retained its situation and continued unmoved at the great
concussion which the foundation must have sustained on the falling of the three stones in 1797.
The situation of this stone, with regard to the ribbed one, No. 26, deserves also notice: the larg
upright seems to be supported by the smaller one, but on'close examination I almost doubted if it
did; the adhesion or connexion between thent is just sumcient to swear by ; and that is all. The
trilithons of this oval are evidently liner stones, and more regular in their forms, than those of the
outward circle, and the leaning stone above the altar, exceeds all the rest in beauty. The third
stone, C l, is next; and the finest impost is the one over the trilithons C 1, and C 2. Some of
these, as well as others in the outward circle, taper from their base towards the top.
It now remains for me to describe the inner oval, which, according to Dr. Stukeley, consisted
originally of nineteen stones, of which I still see traces of eleven, viz. from No.2l to 31. They
are much smoother and taller than those of the inner circle of small stones, and incline to the
pyramidical form. The most perfect of these is No. 23, which is seven feet and a bali' high, twenty-
three inches wide at the base, and decreases to twelve inches at the top. The stone No. 26,
deserves notice from having a groove cut all down it; for what purpose, no rational conjecture
has ever yet been formed; its shape also varies somewhat front that of its companions, as it bevils
oh' almost to an angle on the inner side. The altar-stone is fifteen feet long, and almost totally
covered by the fall of one of the large upright stones and its impost, across it. The inside
diameter of this whole building is about one hundred feet ; and the width of the entrance into the
Cell, from the trilitbons B and F, forty-three feet; and the distance from the altar-stone to the
entrance into the temple, fifty-seven feet, four inches.
Having described with accuracy the form and measurement of this celebrated temple, it may
not be uninteresting to my readers to hear something about the nature of the stones that composed
it. The large upright stone close to the turnpike road, and one
lying Bat on the ground, which
has been called the "
slaughtering stone ;" the two small stones near the valium, as well as all
the great stones composing the outward circle, and the Eve trilithons of the grand oval, are all
sarsen stones, collected from the surface of the Wiltshire downs. Dr. Stukeley informs us, that
this word is Phoenician, and signihes a rock ; what is now understood by sarseu, is a stone drawn
from the native quarry in its rude state! It is generally supposed that these stones were
brought
from the neighbourhood of Abury, in North Wiltshire; and the circumstance of three stones still

In regard to the natural history of these stones," says Stukeley,
"
the whole country hereabouts is a solid body
of chalk, covered with a most delicate tur£ As this chalky matter hardened at creation, it spewcd out the most solid
body of the stones, of greater specific gravity than itself; and, assisted by the c trifuge power, owing to the rotation
of the globe upon its axis, threw them upon its surface, where they now lie." A more modern naturalist has supposed
that a stratum of sand, containing thee stones, once covered the chalk land, and at the deluge this stratum was
washed of from the surface, and the stones leh behind. Certain it is, that we End them dispersed over a great part of
our ehallry district; and they are particularly numerous between Abury and Marlborough; but the celebrated Eeld
called from them the Grey Wethers, no longer presents even a single stone; for they bare all been broken to piec fo:
building, and for repairing the roads.

The area of this temple has naturally excited the investigation of the curious; but no important
discoveries have been made. Stukeley tells us, that a tablet of tin was found there in the time of
'
h t that the most learned
King Henry VIII., inscribed with many letters, but m so strange a c arac er,
antiquaries of the age could make nothing out of it. Some have called it Panic, others Irish ; and

ofone foot, the above discoveries will naturally lead us to suppose, that some persons, since his time,
had dug into the same spot; yet after getting down about two feet, there was less and less vegetable
uld till we reached the solid chalk; some small pieces of bone, a httle charred wood, and some
mo ,
fragments of coarse pottery were intermixed with the soil. In digging into the ditch that surrounds
the area, Mr. Cunnington found similar remnants of antiquity ; and in the waggon tracks, near
Stonehenge, you frequently meet with obippings of the stones of which the temple was constructed.
Soon after the fall of the great trilithon, in 1797, Mr. Cunnington dug out some of the earth that
had fallen into the excavation, and found a fragment of line black Roman pottery, and since that,

ano er piece in p ;
but probably in the earth adjoining the trilithon, and, after the downfal of the latter, fell with the

f
mouldering earth into the excavation. The only conclusion we can draw from the circumstance o
finding Roman pottery on this ground is, that this temple was in existence at the period when that
species of earthenware was made use of by the Britons in our island.
The Plate No. 3, consists of four ground-plans. There is a striking diB'erence betwixt the plans
of Inigo Jones (not here given) and Mr._ Wood, both architects by profession. They agree as to
the outward circle ; but Mr. Wood makes the second circle consist of only twenty-nine instead of
o o
f f
thirty stones. They difer totally in the two next ranges: the former giving the Cell the 01111 0 all
hexagon; the latter making it partly circular and partly straight. The former states the number of
the stones in the third range to he twelve, and the small stones to be eighteen: the latter (like
Stukeley) states the large stones to be ten, and the smaller nineteen; but he places them in a very
different form. It is somewhat singular, that of all those who have given plans of Stonehenge, the

very two men who, from their profession, as architects, ought to have been the most accurate,
should have been the most inaccurate; for on comparing their plans with our ground-plan of the
stones now remaining, you will immediately be convinced that the third and fourth ranges of
stones could never have assumed an
hexagonal figure, nor the Egure designed by Wood?
In the plans lain down by Dr. Stukeley and Dr. Smith, we see a
great concurrency of opinion,
and a much nearer approach to correctness. They agree as to the number of stones in the great
circle and great oval, and very nearly as to their position. Dr. Stnlceley makes the number of
stones in the large circle to be forty, and the small oval nineteen. Dr. Smith makes those of the
small circle to be thirty, and of the small oval thirteen; for he supposes a pair of small trilithons
on each side, one impost only of which remains, and is marked No. 2 in the ground-plan; but Dr.
Stukeley includes the impost in his second circle. The following letter, received from Mr. Cun-
nington, has induced me to add another plan of Stonehenge, which forms Plate No. 7.
"
On viewing the remains of this monument of the Britons, I have been surprised that the
following question never occurred to those writers who have considered this subject, viz., 'Why did
the Britons, in erecting Stonehenge, make use of two kinds of stone, which are
totally dissimilar to
each otheri' Any person versed in mineralogy, will perceive that the stones on the outside of the
work, those composing the outward circle and its imposts, as well as the live large trilithons, are
all of that species of stone called sarsen, which is found in the neighbourhood ; whereas the inner
circle of small upright stones, and those of the interior oval, are composed of granite, hornstone, &,c.,
most probably brought from some part of Devonshire or Cornwall, as I know not where such
stones could be procured at a nearer distance.-|-
"
In considering the subject, I have been led to suppose that Stonehenge was raised at dilferent
:eras ; that the original work consisted of the outward circle and its imposts, and of the inner oval
of large trilithons ; and that the smaller circle and oval, of inferior stones, were raised at a later
period; for they add nothing to the general grandeur of the temple, but rather give a littleness to
the whole; and more particularly so, if, according to Smith, you add the two small trilithons of
granite."
I am much pleased with this new idea respecting Stonehenge, which, to use a well-known Italian
proverb,
"
Se non it vero, e ben trovato,"-U' not true, is well imagined; for it is not like many
others, founded on idle conjecture, but has some rational ground to rest upon. In erecting this
mighty structure, its builders would naturally select for that purpose the materials nearest at hand:
such were the mrsens which compose the grandest part of the work, viz., the outward circle and
large oval; and why, with these materials, acquireable at no
great distance, (for at that early
'
Here three lines of Sir R. C. I-Ioare's d cription are lei! out, because Inigo Jones's plan, to vhich only they refer,
is not given, but Mr. Waltire's is given in the place of it.
1- The author of this work broke olf a small part of one of the nprights of the inner oval, which he got pol.
ighed, and submitted it to one of the lirst geologists in London, who, on seeing it, wit/tout having' the least rurpit-inn
me/acre it mmefrom, said, it looked like an African stone, but if it were British, he thought it must have come from
Anglesey. This stone is in the collection ofthe Geological Society, to which the author gave it. He was told in the
¢-ountry that the tradition was, that these stones were brought by magicians from Africa to Ireland, but that not liking
their residence there, or for some other reason. unknown to the author, the magicians brought them to Salisbury Plain.
This reminds the author of the Crm Santa and its travels, which some people doubt. He gives no
opinion respecting
the travels of temples, but leaves every one to believe what he thinks credible. In the course of this work mother

period the plains adjoining Stonehenge might very probably have furnished stones suiiiciently large,)
should the architects have sought materials for the small circle and small oval in such distant coun-
ties P This difference in the stones is a
strong argument in favour of Mr. Cunnington'a conjecture;
for had the Britons erected the temple at one and the same period, they would most naturally have.
made use of the native, not of foreign, materials. And in viewing this new-supposed plan of
Stonehenge, divested of its unmeaning piginy pillars of granite, and diminutive trilithons, we he-
hold a most majestic and mysterious pile, unconfused in its plan, simple and grand in its architec-
ture, most awful and imposing in its effect. Such, indeed, is the general fascination imposed on all
those who view it, that no one can quit its precincts without feeling strong sensations of surprise
and admiration. The ignorant rustic will, with a vacant stare, attribute it to the giants, or the mighty
arch-fiend ; and the antiquary, equally uninformed as to its origin, will regret that its history is
veiled in perpetual obscurity. The artist, on
viewing these enormous masses, will wonder that art
could thus rival nature in magnificence and picturesque eiiect. Even the most indiferent passen-
ger over the Plain must be attracted by the solitary and magnificent appearance of these ruins;
and all with one accord will exclaim,
"
How grand ! How wonderful! How incomprehensible!
The next object that attracts our attention is the Avenue. It is a narrow strip of land, bounded
on each side by a slight agger of earth. On referring to the map of the environs of Stonehenge,
where its situation and form will be best seen, you will perceive that it issues from the N.E. en-
trance of the temple; then crossing the turnpike road, proceeds in a straight line towards a valley,
where it divides into two branches, the one leading in a gentle curve towards the Cursus, the other
directing its course in a direct line up the hill between two rows of burrows, planted with lir~trees.
The most northern group has been called by Stukeley the old King Barrow: ; the opposite group
the new King Barrows ; and under these titles I have distinguished them in my map. The former
are lower and Hatter in their construction than the latter, which increase in height with the ground
towards the South.
ln the eye of the antiquary, they are much disfigured by the clumps of Scotch lirs planted upon
them, though at the same time secured from the researches of his spade. More than an usual
regularity is preserved in the disposal of these tumuli; and I must here call the attention of my
readers to the map, where they will perceive them ranged in a semicircular line, and a
passage
decidedly left for the Avenue, of which traces are still evident as far as this spot; but it has after-
wards been obliterated by tillage in its passage through Amesbury Park. Here again we have
another proof of Stmzelzenge and its Avenue having been formed prior to the surrounding barrows,
and we see a rude attempt at symmetry in the seven burrows, arranged in two separate lines,
which Bank the avenue (like wings) on its ascending the summit of the hill. Dr. Stukeley sup-
poses that the avenue continued its course in a direct line to Radfyn farm,' on the banks of the
Avon and from thence to Haradon Hill, a
lofty eminence on the opposite side; but even in his
t' e the traces of it were not distinguishable much farther than nt present. The length of the
rm ,
avenue from the ditch round Stonehenge to the spot where it branches od; is ive hundred and
ninety-four yards; and from thence it is visible about eight hundred and fourteen yards up
the hill.
The Northern branch appears undoubtedly to lead towards the eursus, though its traces become

very faint soon after it has quitted the eastern line up the hill. It seem to have pursued abending
course towards the cursus, but I could not perceive that it pointed to any decided opening in
that work.
We are now led to the Cursus, or the Race-Course of the Britons, a most interesting and perfect
relic of antiquity. It is situated north of Stonehenge, and extends in a line from East to West.
According to Mr. Croclcerir measurement, its length is one mile, Eve furlongs, and one hundred
and seventy-six yards; its breadth one hundred and ten yards. The head of it, which is towards
the east, is marked by a mound of earth, resembling a
long barrow, which extends across the
whole cursus. Here the spectators of the Race were seated, and a more
eligible post could not
have been chosen; for the ground descends from hence at Hrst in a very gentle slope, and then
ascends a
slight hill, affording to the spectators a most comprehensive view of the vhole course.
Some few particularities attend this cursus, which deserve notice. At the distance of fifty-Eve
yards from the eastern end, which is terminated, as I have before said, by an
oblong elevated
mound, you evidently perceive the termination of the course rounded off, as if the horses or cha-
riots made a turn at this spot; and at the distance of six hundred and thirty-eight yards from this
end, are two entrances into the area of the cursus, opposite to each other; and eight hundred and
twenty-tive yards further on, the valium has been much broken down by the continual track of
waggons; and to this spot Dr. Stukeley supposes the northern branch of the avenue from Stone-
henge pointed.
At a short distance from the western extremity, a
slight bank runs across the cursus; and
between it and the end, which is rounded olf, there are two burrows irregularly placed within the
area. This bank cannot be accounted for satisfactorily; for we can hardly suppose, that if the
chariots started from the east end, they would drive over this bank to the termination of the course
at the west end. The elevated mound at the east end, seems to announce that to have been the
seat of honour; and the superior view which it commands of the whole extent of the course, fully
corroborates that supposition. We are again assured, that a bank across the end of the cursus
formed a part of the general plan of these places of amusement, by a second example in the smaller
adjoining cursus; and we also see that the barrows, within the area of the larger cursus, were not
placed there as metm, (as in the Roman circus,) for there are none within the area of the smaller
cursus.
They probably stood on that ground long before the formation of this course, and being
between the bank and the end, could not have impeded the races, as I can never suppose that the
chariots passed over the bank: they might, perhaps, have started from this end; and in that case
the bank would prove no
impediment to their career.
The plan, both of the large and small cursus, corresponds so much with that of the Roman
circus, that I feel inclined to think that the formation of these on our Wiltshire downs, took
place after the settlement of the Romans in our island, and that they cannot be deemed of British
origin.
Quitting Stonehenge, with its sppendant antiquities, and pursuing our inquiries towards Ames-
bury, we lind three iumuli situate between the avenue and the tumpike road. No. 24 is a
very
flat barrow, in which were the skeletons of an adult and achild, deposited in a very shallow cist, and
which had been disturbed by a
prior opening. No. 25 is a wide bowl-shaped barrow, in which
we End, within a shallow cist, a skeleton with its head towards the north, and a
drinking-cup by
its right side, and near it aneatly-formed pin, or needle of bone. No. 26 is situated on the borders
of the turnpike road, and produced a large interment of burned bones on the floor, with a cone
c
X S'I'0NEHENGE1DESCRIPTI0N OF PLATES.
of jet, two oblong beads of the same substance, eighteen of amber, and a very small cone of
the same.
From hence the road to Amesbury leads us,on the edge of the Duke of Queensbury's park,
through an ancient earthen work, commonly called Vespasian's Camp, which shall be described in
my next Iter.
Iter. II. Vespasian`s Camp. This extensive work is generally supposed to be Roman, and has,
as well as the neighbouring camp of Yambury, been attributed by Stukeley to the Emperor Ves-
pssian. That this great general occupied one or both of them, during his condicts with the Belgm,
is not unlikely; but that he constructed either of them is very improbable, as
they bear no resem-
blance whatever to the camps formed by the Romans. This was
originally the strong hold of those
numerous Britons who inhabited the plains around Stonehenge, an asylum in times of danger for
their wives, children, and cattle; such as our experience has taught us existed all over our downs,
and especially near those districts selected by the Britons for their residence. Such we 5nd at
Yarnbury, Amesbury, and Everley, in this immediate neighbourhood, and such we lind dispersed
all over our county. These camps were afterwards taken possession of by the succeeding nations
of Romans, Danes, and Saxons, as occasion and necessity required; and to the more modem
conquerors we chiedy may attribute the immense ramparts and outworks added to the original and
more simple work of the Britons.
This camp occupies the apex of a hill, surrounded on two sides, east and south, by the river
Avon. It comprehends within its area thirty-nine acres, extends in length from south to north,
and terminates in a narrow-rounded angle at the latter point. It was surrounded by a single
vellum, which has been much mutilated on the east side in forming the pleasure-grounds of Ames-
bury park. The ramparts on the western side, towards Stonehenge, are very bold and perfect.
It appears to have had two entrances, north and south; the former still remains perfect and un-
doubted. The area is planted and fancifully disposed in avenues, walks, &c. ; near the principal
one of which, and on the highest ground, is the appearance of a barrow, but much disfigured in
its form.
From this camp, I shall direct my steps to the old and new Kings' Barrows, near the fonner of
which is a solitary tumulus, No. 27, which appeared to have had a prior opening, and to have con-
tained, originally, the skeletons of two adults and two children. Round the arm of one of the
former was an ornamented bracelet of brass, which the labourers unfortunately trod upon, before
they perceived it, and broke it into three pieces, but it has been repaired, and preserved in our
Museum.
On our approaching the Cursus, we ind a numerous continuation of borrows, flanking the
southern side of it; the first of which is No. 28, and one of those opened by Lord Pembroke, in
the year 1723, as well as No. 29, of which I shall copy the account given by Stukeley, in his de-
scription of Stonehenge, page 44.
"In the year 1723, by Thomas Earl of Pemhroke's order, I began upon a barrow north of
Stonehenge, in that group south of the cursus. It is one of the double barrows there, and the
more easterly and lower of the two; likewise somewhat less. It WB8 reasonable to believe this
was the sepulchre of a man and his wife ; and that the lesser was the female; and so it proved, at
leasta daughter. We made a large cut on the top, from east to west, and aRer the turf was
taken oE, we came to the layer of chalk, then to ine garden mould. About three feet below the
surface was a layer of Hints, humouring the eonvexity of the barrow. These llints are gathered
S'l°0NEHEN'GE'_DESCRl'PTION OF PLATES. Xi
from the surface of the downs in some places, especially where it has been ploughetl. This being
about a foot thick, rested on a soft layer of mould another foot, in which was inclosed an um full
of bones. The urn was of unbaked clay, of a dark reddish colour, and crumbled into pieces. It
had been rudely wrought with small mouldings round the verge, and other circular channels on
the outside, with several indentures between, made with a
pointed tool. The bones had been
burned, and crowded all together in a little heap, not so much as a hat-crown would contain. It
appears to have been a girl of about fourteen years old, by their bulks, and the great quantity of
female ornaments mixed with the bones, all which we gathered. Beads of all sorts, and in great
number, of glass of divers colours, mostly yellow, one black; many single, munyin long pieces
notched between, so as to resemble a
string of beads, and these were generally of a blue colour.
'1`here were many of amber, of all shapes and sizes; lint squares, long squares, round, oblong, little
and great. Likewise many of earth, of different shapes, magnitude, and colour; some little and
white, many large and llattish like a button, others like a
pulley; but all had holes to run a string
through, either through their diameter or sides. Many of the button sort seem to have been
covered with metal, there being a rim worked in them, wherein to tum the edge of the covering_
One of these was covered with a thin Elm of pure gold. These were the young lady's ornaments,
and all had undergone the iire, so that what would easily consume fell to pieces as soon as handled;
much of the amber was humed half through. This person was a heroine, for we found the head of
her javelin in brass. At the bottom are two holes for the pins that fastened it to the stahl Besides,
there was a
sharp bodkin, round at one end, square at the other, where it went into a handle. I
still preserve whatever is permanent of these trinkets; but we
reoomposed the ashes of the il1us»
trious defunct, and covered them with earth, leaving visible marks at the top of the barrow having
been opened, to dissuade any other from again disturbing them; and this was our practice in all
the rest.
"
Then we opened the next barrow to it, inclosed in the same ditch, which we supposed to be
that of the husband or hither of this lady. At fourteen inches deep, the mould being mixed with
chalk, we came to the entire skeleton of a man; the skull and all the bones exceedingly rotten, and
perished through length of time, though this was a barrow of the latest sort, as we conjecture.
The body lay north and south, the head to the north."
Not discouraged by the external appearances, and convinced by experience that all interments
found near the surface were subsequent deposits, Mr. Cunnington, in 1803, explored the second
tumulus, by making a section rather to the south of the centre, when, at the depth of six feet, he
came to the door of the barrow, which was covered with ashes; and on digging still further to the
south, he found a ine oblong cist, about eighteen inches deep, Eileen inches wide, and two feet
long, and in it a
complete interment of humed bones, and with them six beads apparently of horn,
four of which were perforatei the other two were circular, and rather Hat, but all appeared as
though they had been burned. Dr. Stukeley made the same observation respecting the articles
found in the other barrow; but he must have been mistaken as to the amber, for we know that
tire would entirely consume it.
No. 30. A beautifulbell-shaped barrow, and the largest of this group. It measured in diameter,
from ditch to ditch, one hundred and thirty-one feet, and fifteen feet in elevation. The superior
sine and beauty of this tumulus particularly excited our curiosity, and raised our
expectations of
success; but alasl after immense labour in throwing out the earth, to the depth of Efteen feet, we
found only a simple interment of burned bones, unaccompanied by any urn, arms, or trinkets.
c 2
Xii srounxnsoe-nescnrrrxos or raaras.
The relics were piled up in a little heap upon the floor where the body had been burned, and close
to a small circular cist or cinerarium, which contained black ashes, intermixed with some small
fragments of bone. No. 31, a bowl-shaped barrow, one hundred and four feet in base diameter,
and seventy-one and a half in elevation, produced on its iioor an interment of burned bones with u
small spear-head: and No. 32, a fine bell-shaped barrow, contained onlya simple interment of
burned bones. No. 33 is a kind of Druid barrow, presenting an area of seventy-eight feet diameter,
surrounded by a Bne valium without the ditch, but having no elevation, as usual, in the centre.
Deprived of this index to the place of interment, we expected much trouble in Ending it; but our
workmen luckily hit on the very spot; and, at the depth of two feet, found a circular cist, con-
taining a deposit of burned bones, together with a
great many beads. Some of them were pulley
beads of glass, two of stone, another of a
transparent horn-like substance; but the most were of
amber, and much decayed. No. 34 has had a
prior opening; and in No. 35 we could not find the
interment. No. 36. The contents of this barrow, in some degree, recompensed us for our dis-
appointment in the two last. It produced three human skeletons, laid from north to south, and
immediately one over the other; the drst about two feet deep; the second on alevel with the
adjoining soil. Close to the right side of the head of this last skeleton was a drinking-cup, and
with it a considerable quantity of something that appeared like decayed leather. Six feet lower
lay the third, with which was found a drinking-cup. When throwing out the bones of this skeleton,
we had a strong proof how well they are
preserved when deposited deep in the chalk, as they would
bear being thrown to a considerable distance without breaking. The teeth were perfectly white,
and not one of them unsound; but the most remarkable circumstance was, finding a piece of the
skull, about Eve inches broad, that had been apparently sawn off, for I do not think that any knife
could have cut it od' in the manner in which this was done. No. 37. In this barrow we found oniy
a
large oblong cist, full of black ashes, and a few burned human bones; and in No. 38, after much
labour, we missed the interment. No. 39 is a bowl-shaped tumulus, adjoining the south side of
the cursus. It is seventy-eight feet in diameter, and at this time nearly seven feet in elevation,
although it has been some years under tillage. This interesting barrow had experienced a
prior,
but a
partial opening, and one skeleton, with a
drinking-cup, had been disturbed. On reaching
the door, we discovered another skeleton, lying with its head due north, which, from the size of
the bones, and the great quantity of beads attending the interment, we conceived to have been
that of a female ; and several of these being found near the neck, confirmed, in some degree, this
opinion. Close to the head stood a kind of bason, neatly ornamented round the verge, but un-
fortunately broken into several pieces. On removing the head, we were much surprised to find
that it rested upon a
drinking-cup, that had been placed at the feet of another skeleton, and which
was interred in an oblong cist two feet deep, and lying also from north to south. With the
drinking-cup were a spear-head of Hint and a
singular stone.
In this tumulus, three persons were interred 5 the primary deposit must, of course, have been the
skeleton lying in a cist, excavated within the chalk; the second was probably the wife of this
person, lying with ber head at his feet; and the third and last might have been their son. The
drinking-cup, found at the feet of the primary interment, is large, and holds more than a quart; it
resembles in form and manufacture many of the others, is made out of poor clay, intermixed with
bits of chalk, yet it is profusely ornamented, and in a different style from any we have yet seen. How
such a multitude of indentations could be put on the surface while the clay retained its flexibility
is surprising; for it is very clear, that these ornaments were put on singly, and most probably by a
srossuexan-nascarrrron or Pr..rr»:s. xiii
bone instrument. The sharpness and nieety to which this spear-head of flint as well as the arrows
of the same material have been chipped, must also strike the attention of every observer. Yet we
know them to have been made use 05 by all barbarians, for destructive purposes. Neither must
the aforementioned stone be passed over unnoticed ; it is very neatly polished, feels silky, and, at
lirst sight, looks something like fossil wood: it is striped irregfllarly, with dark green and white.
Mr. Cunnington thinks it is of that species of stone called by Kirwan, '
ligniformed asbestos,' and
that it may have been considered by the Britons as of high value, from its supposed virtues.
No. 40, in point of size, maybe called the Monarch of the Plain, being evidently the largest
hnrrow upon it; and its history still remains veiled in obscurity. The first time we
opened it by
a very large section, and examined well the door ; but though we perceived symtoms of cremation,
in charred wood, &.c., we could not discover the primary interment. Nor were our
subsequent
researches more favourable, and we still remain in ignorance. Perhaps some future antiquary may
be more fortunate; and such is the caprice of ancient sepulture, that the deposit may be found near
the top, as in the instance of our dint barrow at Kingston Deverill. No. 41 produced an inter-
ment of burned bones. No. 49, nearly opposite the last-mentioned barrow, but on the south side
of the turnpike road, is a neat circular tumulus, sixty-six feet in diameter, and six feet in elevation,
which was
opened in 1803, and produced, within a circular cist, an interment of burned bones, and
a brass pin with part of its handle, deposited in a neat and perfect urn. No. 43 and No. 44. These
two barrows are included within the boundaries of the curms, and very near the westem end of
it. In opening the first of these, our labourers discovered, at the depth of three feet, the skeleton
of an adult, with a
drinking-cup, and, on the door of the barrow, another of a child. We alterwards,
in a shallow cist, found the third skeleton of a man, lying with his head to the north; and close to
it, on the right-hand side, was a curious pebble, and under his left hand was a
dagger of brass. The
pebble is kidney-formed, of the sardonyx kind, striated
transversely with alternate spaces, that give
it the appearance of belts; besides these sh-ia, it is spotted all over with very small white speeks,
and, after dipping it into water, it assumes a
sea-green colour. In the adjoining barrow, No. 44,
we found only a
simple interment of burned bones.-The next barrows that occur in our Iter west-
ward, are three in number, placed nearly in a parallel line to each other. No. 45, 46, 47, all of
which proved uninteresting in their contents. The first and last produced simple interments of
burned bones; the second, a rude urn with cremation. No. 48, a Druid barrow, contained an
interment of burned bones, with a brass pin. No. 49 is a long barrow. No. 50 is a circular bowl-
shaped barrow, in the examination of which we experienced much perplexity, although not uncom-
mon, owing to the Britons having adopted so
many modes of burial. At the depth of live feet, we
found a regular stratum of Hints, intermixed with black vegetable mould; on
removing which we
came to the door of the barrow, in which some excavations had been made, and channels formed.
One of these was connected with the cist, which contained a skeleton lying from south to north;
in another channel, we found a
large branch of a
stag's horn, and in a little corner, we took out a
shorelful of bones, intermixed with earth, which were broken almost as small as chaff. Near the
feet of the skeleton lay a considerable quantity of very small bones of birds or mice. The day
being far advanced, we did not pursue all the channels, and it is very probable that this barrov
may contain other skeletons. No. 5l, a line bell-shaped barrow ninety-live feet in diameter, and
seven feet in elevation. At the depth of four feet and a half in the native soil, viz. eleven feet and
a half from the summit, we found two skeletons with their heads laid towards the north; the one
an adult, the other a young person, not more than about twelve years of age. No. 52 and 53. We
Xl' STOXEHESGE-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
were unsuccessful in our attempts on these two large burrows. In the fomier, we perceived several
marks of very intense tire, with some earth, quite black, and some burned to a brick colour. In the
latter, near the centre, we found acircular cist containing only ashes, but missed the primary inter-
ment. An unusual quantity of small bones, probably of birds, were dispersed about the barrow,
and, seven feet in elevation, produced on the door and near the centre s circular cist, about eighteen
inches wide, and one foot deep, full of wood ashes, and a few fragments of burned bones. About
two feet to the north of the above was another cist, No. 54, of an oblong form, much larger and
deeper than the other, which contained an interment of burned' bones, piled up in a
heap in the
centre of the cist. The next barrow, No. 55, was opened some years ago, and produced only a
simple interment of burned bones. Alittle on the other side of the Devizes road is a mound, which
being only a land mark is not numbered. In the adjoining large flat barrow, No. 56, we discovered
a cist, that had been previously investigated, but on opening it, the workmen found an arrow-head
of flint near the top.
I shall now direct my steps towards Amesbury, over a beautiful down, ahounding with tumuli
of various descriptions. The iirst group that occurs, is situated near the northem limits of our
map, and is numbered from 57 to 65, and consists of four Druid and ive circular barrows. As
they all bore the marks of prior opening, l did not attempt any of them; some had been explored
a few years ago, by Mr. Cunnington, at a time when no idea was entertained of prosecuting his
researches to the present extent, and when no very regular account was
kept of his discoveries! We
now come to three large harrows on the declivity of a hill, 66, 67, 66. No. 66 is a low barrow, in
which were fragments of a human skull, of a lnrge sepulchral um, and a
drinking-cup. No. 67 has
a
very irregular and mutilated surface z each seems to have had s prior opening. No. 68 is a pond
barrow. On the opposite bill is a beautiful group of hmmuli thickly strewed over a rich and verdant
down. Their perfect appearance raised our expectation of success, and the attendance of many of
my friends from Salisbury, and a beautiful day, enlivened our prospects; but we had again sad cause
to exclaim Fronti nullajides-Trust not to outward appearances. No arrow-heads were found to
mark the profession of the British hunter; no gilded dagger to point out to ns the chieftain of the
clan; nor any necklace of amber or jet, to distinguish the British female, or to present to her fair
descendants, who honoured us with their presence on this occasion: a few rude urns marked the
antiquity and poverty of the Britons who Gxed on this spot as their mausoleum. Unproductive,
however, as were the contents of these borrows, it may not be uninteresting to the antiquary,
whom either chance or curiosity leads across these ine plains, to know their history.
No. 69 had been opened in former times by Mr. Cunnington. No. 70 contains an interment
of burned bones, deposited in an irregular cist. No. 71, a Druid barrow of the second class, or
rather bowl-shaped within a ditch, produced the skeleton of a child near the surface, and lower
down two rude sepulcbral urns, the one above the other, each containing burned bones. No. 72
had been opened before by Mr. Cunnington, and produced a sepulcbrsl urn. No. 73, a Druid
barrow of the second class, contained near the surface a skeleton, with four wooden beads near
its neck; and it appeared that another interment of burned bones had been taken out. No.74

is also a Druid barrow, but the elevated mound was not in the centre of the area. It produced a
einerarium, and ashes in a cist. No. 75 had been opened before, as well as No. 76 and 77, and in
78 we could find nothing. No. 79 had also experienced a prior opening. No. 80 is not sepulchral.
ln No. Sl we discovered a
large rude um. containing an interment of burned bones. No. 82 had a
cinemrium, and two simple interments of burned bones, just under the surface. No. 83 contained
a sepulchral urn, with a small brass pin. To the south of No. 80, on the opposite hill, i a Druid
barrow (not inserted in the plan), which produced a
large rude urn without an interment.
In the same easterly direction, but nearer to the cursus, is another line group of harrows, equally
inviting to the eye, but nearly as
unproductive as the preceding.
No. 84 is the largest barrow in this group, and has been ploughed over. In making our section,
we found pieces of stags' horns, pottery, and the remains of a skeleton and drinking-cup, and two
knives; but the primary interment was a skeleton, with its legs gathered up, and its hands placed
under its head. No. 85 contained originally an interment of burned bones, within a cist, but had
been opened. No. 86 had also experienced the same
investigation; it had a circular cist, and a
cinerarium. No. 87, u Druid barrow of the second class, contained fragments of an urn and burned
bones in a shallow circular cist. No. BS, a similar but liner barrow, produced, near the surface,
just under the turg the fragments of a rude urn and burned bones, and, lower down, a
sepulchral
um reversed over a
deposit of bumed bones. No. 89 has been in tillage: it contained a skeleton,
placed in along circular eist with its head towards the north. No. 90, in tillage, produced a
large
urn nxdely ornamented, and inverted over a deposit of bumed bones. No. 91 contained an interment
of burned bones, deposited on the door of the barrow; and beneath it was a
deep eist, containing
abundance of ashes and charred wood, intermixed with particles of bone. No. 92. ln digging
down to the door of this barrow, we discovered the remains of a skeleton, with fragments of a
funeral urn, bumed bones, and some enormous
pieces of stags' horns. Within a cist, excavated
beneath the floor of the barrow, lay a skeleton with its legs gathered up, and its head placed towards
the north. No. 93 contained, near the top, an interment of burned bones, in a rude broken um,
with a small cup; also, the remains of a skeleton, charred wood, stags' horns, and dint apparently
prepared for warlike instruments. The primary deposit was a skeleton, with its head placed
towards the south-east, accompanied by a Ene drinking-cup, richly ornamented, and in the highest
state of preservation.
No. 94 being sown with wheat could not be investigated. No. 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99, proved
totally uninteresting, and contained, ehiedy, interments of burned bones. On the opposite bill,
eastward, is another group of nine ba:-rows. No. l00 contained a
simple interment of burned
bones within a circular cist. No. l0l, a similar interment, accompanied with two black rings of
some bituminous substance, and one
pulley head. No. 102, an interment of burned bones in a cist,
with remnants ofthe cloth in which the relics were
enveloped. No. 103, a deep circular eist with
ashes. No. |04 is a
large dst circular barrow, which had been opened, and must have proved both
interesting and productive to those who iirst investigated it. In the course of our examination, we
found the bones of several skeletons, fragments of urns, and a rude instrument made from a
stag's
horn; there was also a
large and deep cist. No. 105 and 106 had been opened by others. No. 107
produced a small interment of burned bones, with a pin of bone at top, and under it a pile of ashes
in a cist. No. 108 is a
pond barrow.
On a
rising ground to the nonh, and a little beyond the barn, is another group of seven burrows,
No. 109, ll0, and ll l, had been investigated ; on
opening the Brst, we found the soil intennixed with
xvi STONEHENGE-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES-
the turf, which clearly indicated a
prior opening. We were deterred from making any attempt 011
the second barrow, by a great cavity in its apex; and we found the third had been examined.
No. 112 is a double barrow rising towards the east, and somewhat resembling a
long barrow, but
ditched all around. The lowest part had been opened, and contained an interment of burned bones.
In the other mound we found an interment of burned bones, secured by a linen cloth under a rude
urn. No. 113 had been examined before, but we found in it fragments of an urn and skeleton. No.
114 contained a deposit of burned bones and ashes, in adeep cist. No. 115 contained also a similar
interment, but had been opened before. I had for along time viewed these two last groups of bar-
rows with satisfaction, and anticipated much pleasure and success in opening them. I had also
reserved them for the gratilicatiou of some of my friends in the neighbourhood, who attended our
operations: judge, then, of my mortification and disappointment, in Ending that many of them,
though with the most even and apparently maiden surface, had been already investigated, and
robbed of their contents; and the remainder either totally unproductive or uninteresting! Poor,
indeed, were the Britons who once inhabited these Plains; unlike their rich neighbours, whose relics
were
deposited in the vicinity, and particularly on the southern side of Stonehenge; but though
disappointment attended our researches in this district, truth is obtained, and the history of these
numerous barrows remains no longer involved in obscurity. Adjoining the cursur, and nearly in a
line with it, are a few small burrows. No. 116 had been opened before. No. 117 contained a
small rude urn, with an interment of burned bones. No. 118 is a small long barrow, and produced
a deposit of burned bones and black ashes, in a neat circular cist. No. 119 contained an interment
of burned bones in a small cist. No. 120 is a pond barrow 5 and No. 121 produced a rude urn
reversed over a deposit of burned bones.
From hence I proceed towards the vale of the river Avon; where, adjoining the public road, we
fmd the interesting remains of a spacious British town or village, called Durrington, or Long Walls.
The tirst name is evidently derived from the Celtic word dur, water, and applies to the situation of
the adjoining village of Durrington near the river. The site of this ancient settlement is decidedly
marked by a circular embankment, partly natural and partly artilicisl, which shelters it from the
south-west winds: the view it commands in front is delightful-facing the rich and well-wooded
vale, and the lofty range of Haradon and adjoining hills. Having been for many years in tillage,
its form is much mutilated; but from what remains, it appears to have been of a circular form, and
to have had a vellum all around it on the high ground, but not on the east side near the water.
We picked up a great deal of pottery within the area of the works.
On viewing the country round Stonehenge, and remarking with surprise the numerous memorials
of the dead, so thickly scattered over these extensive Plains, we are led naturally to inquire,
"
Where were the habitatione of the living P" This question can be answered in part, but not so
fully as I could wish, by the discoveries we have made in the British villages, on Wmterboum
Stoke, Durrington, and Lake downs; many others would probably have been found in the environs
of Stonehenge, had not the soil been tumed up by the plough. We are fortunate, however, in
having rescued so many from oblivion, and to have thrown aside the thick veil which, notwith-
standing the active researches of Stnkeley, has, till this period, obscured them. On the south side
of Durrington Walls is an elevated mound, bearing the 'appearance of a barrow, No. 122, in which
we dug to the depth of eleven feet, but found no
sepulcbral marks whatever. A little further on
the right of the road leading to Amesbury, we see the mutilated remains of an enormous Druid
barrow, No. 123, and still further on the same side of the road, a very singular tumulus, No. 124,
S'l'ONElIENGE='DESCl'lIP'l'ION 0F PLATES. -
xvii
appearing like three barrows rising from one large base, but certainly s long barrow. It stands
from south-west to north-east, and has its wide end towards the west; on the small end, and
also on the centre, are mounds resembling two circular barrows. We opened that on the small
end, and found only a few ashes and charred wood; but in the central mound we discovered, near
the top a skeleton and a drinking-cup, both of which had been disturbed. On reaching the door
I
of the long barrow, we found a circular cist like alittle well, but it contained no interment; from
this well-like cist, s tunnel, like a chimney, ascended nearly to the top. I imagine that, as in
most of our long burrows, the primary interment would he found at the broad end. In this
tumulus we have rather a singular instance of a circular barrow being raised upon a
long barrow.
No. 125 in tillage appears to have been a barrow of very large proportions; and there are two
I 3
others in the corn-fields nearer the park, No. 126, 127, which we have not attempted to open.
il d
There are also near them, under the hill, some appearances of earthen works much mut ate ,
which I cannot account for: I once thought they formed part of a circle, but I cannot speak with
any decision about them.
Before I conclude this Iter, let me call the attention of my readers to the annexed map of
Stonehenge and its environs, in which the hills, roads, antiquities, and burrows, are accurately laid
ll
down, from actual measurement. ln it you will had a striking picture of ancient times. You wi
c the s ot selected by the earliest inhabitants of our island for their residence ; you will behold
se
that stugendous monument of antiquity, Stonehenge, the building set apart for their civil or
religious assemblies: you will perceive its connexion, by means of the avenue, with the cursus, a
spot appropriated to their games and races; you will recognize also in the camp vulgarly attributed
to the Emperor Vespasian, the strong hold of the Britons, or the asylum for their families and
lerds in times ot' danger- at Durrington, and on Winterbourn Stoke Downs, you will sce the
I I I
habitations of the Britons, with the lines of communication from one village to another; and in
the numerous barrows dispersed over this extensive plain, you will distinguish the simple me-
morials of the mighty dead. In short, you will have clearly traced to your imagination's eye a most
impressive history of our ancient Britons.--Thus far Sir R. Cour HoanB's History of Wiltshire.
Sir R. C. Hoare has observed, that Stonehenge cannot have been the work of the Druids, bemuse
the stones are of such a description that it would require the strength of s nation to constnxct it. I
confess I was surprised at the argument, because I had no idea that any person could imagine that
these priests, powerful and numerous as they were, could by themselves perform the work. Their
name is always used because the name of the nation has been doubtful. But they were the priests
of the nation, they were the architects, and they were the causes of its building. From the recent
work of a gentleman, called Bnows, who, I am told, is a person well qualiied to form a
judgment
on the subject of which he has given an opinion-that is, of the dimculty of getting the stones to
the place, I now submit the following extract. It is an admitted fact that the stones could come
from no place but the GYQ/ Wethns. There is no other place for them to come from, and they
are distant about twenty miles:
"
All persons will readily agree, that if the stones of Stonehenge were selected from amongst
those called the Grey Wethers, they must have been conveyed from thence either by land or water.
It is not impossible for them to have been brought through Clatford Bottom, over Oare Hill; but
to tran port them from thence over the numerous intervening eminences to Stonehenge, is what
must appear unlikely even for the Antediluvians to have effected, admitting their strength to have
been proportioned to the length of their lives. This I would again aiirm, in the most determined
manner, from a careful inspection of the country. To regard it as the work of any people since
n
xviii sroxsnzxos-nescaxrrlos or nares.
the dood, is actually monstrous. To the river Avon, therefore, we are of necessity obliged to loolc
as the means of their conveyance. But what is this river at the present time? A small meander-
ing stream, wholly inadequate to serve as a
conveyance for the stones of Stonehenge, even were
it flowing without interruption; whereas, in its progress from its source at Burbage to Lake,
within two miles and a quarter of Stonehenge, there are atleast Sheen mills, and as many hatches
or dams. Even with these aids it forms but a small stream: how much smaller would it then be
were they taken away! 1-The assertion, therefore, that the larger stones with which Stonehenge
is built cannot have been brought from amongst the Screens or Grey Wcthers, .ss run ansmvzn
vases of their origin, under the present existing state of land and water, by any people that ever
inhabited our country since the deluge, is what no reasonable person would attempt to deny on an
attentive survey of them." Baows on Stonehenge, p. 27.
WALTIB.E'S srosensxoa.
The ground-plan, Plate No. 4, is taken from a model in Cork, made by a
very respectable old
philosopher and astronomer, of the name of Wiwrnut, who travelled the country many years as
a lecturer in natural philosophy. He encamped and remained on the ground two months, in order
to make himself master of the subject; and a model which is now in the possession of Mr. Dalian,
of York, was the fruit of his labour. He occasionally delivered a couple of lectures upon the sub-
ject of this temple. After his death, these written essays came into the possession of Mr. Dalton,
who, by some accident or other, has lost them, a loss which I most exceedingly regret, as I con-
ceive that they would have been very valuable; for he was well known to be a deep-thinking
man, and a man of the strictest veracity. By an attendant on his lectures, who made minutes of
them at the time, I was informed, that Mr. Waltire thought this temple had been constructed for
several uses; that it was peculiarly well contrived for the performance of secret rites which were
practised in early times-as, if a person stood without he could not see any thing that was done
in the centre, provided the entrance were closed, as it might be very effectually, by three persons
standing before it. If a person stood on the large stone or altar, within the inner curve, which
is a parabola and not an ellipse, he might be heard, when peaking, by all within the temple.-
Another use for which he thought this structure had been erected, was that of making astro-
nomical observations on the heavenly bodies. By careful observations made on the spot, Mr. WC
found, that the barrows or tumuli surrounding this temple accurately represented the situation and
magnitude of the Bxed stars, forming a correct and complete planisphere. Eight hundred only can
be seen by the unassisted eye, but he thought he traced lilteen hundred, the smaller representing
stars too minute to be observed without some instrument similar to a telescope; and that there are
other proofs of the occupiers of this structure having possessed something answering to our redee-
ting telescope. He thought he could prove that other barrows registered all the eclipses which had
taken place within a certain number of years; that the trilithons are registers of the transits of
Mercury and Venus; the meridian line had then been even with the avenue or approach, and the
grand entrance and the altar-stone within the innermost curve, but which is now removed seventy-
live degrees from it.--From the loose way in which these accounts were taken, it is evident that,
though they are curious, and afford ground for future researches, yet they cannot be depended on.
But this is not the case with his model, which records his opinion of its original structure better
than any writing could have done. I have, therefore, substituted a
plan of it in the plate, instead
of that ofInigo Jones, which is agreed, by every one who has examined it, to be wrong.

AB URY.
Tan following account of Ancnv is extracted from the magnificent I17Zrtor_y of
Pwlrslaire, published by Srn R. Co LT Hoann, Bart. The reader will find, if he think
proper to examine, that it is much more to be depended on than the work of D,-_
STUKELEY. Sir R. C. Hoare appears to have spared no trouble or expense. The
country is greatly obliged to this learned and liberal gentleman for the pains which he has
taken to preserve the memory of this magnificent and surprising work. He commences
with an extract from the work of Dr. Stukeley.
"
Tas situation of Abury is finely chosen for the purpose it was destined to, being the more
elevated part of a
plain, from whence there is almost an
imperceptible descent every way. Bug as
the religious work in Abury, though great in itself, is but a
part of the whole, (the avenues
stretching above a mile from it each way,) the situation of the whole design is projected with great
judgment, in a kind of large, separate plain, four or tive miles in diameter. Into this you descend
on all sides from higher ground. The whole Temple of Abury may be considered as a
picture, and
it really is so. Therefore the founders wisely contrived, that a
spectator should have an advanta-
geous prospect of it, as he approached within vicw.* When I frequented this place, which I did
for some years together, to take an exact account of it, staying a
hartnight at a time, I found out
the entire work by degrees. The second time I was here, an avenue was a new amusement: the
third year another. So that at length I discovered the mystery of it, properly speaking, which
was, that the whole figure represented a snake transmitted through a circle. This is an hiero-
glyphic or symbol of highest note and antiquityrr
"
In order to put this design in execution, the founders well studied their ground ; and to make
their representation more natural, they artfully carried it over a
variety of elevations and depres-
sures, which, with the curvature of the avenues, produces suiciently the desired eEect. To make
it still more elegant and picture-like, the head of the snake is carried up the southern promontory
of Haclrpen Hill, towards the village of West Kennet; nay, the very name of the hill is derived
from this circumstance, of which we may well say with Lucnn, Lib. vii.,
"
'Hinc avi veteris custos; famosa. vetustas,
Miratrixque sui signavit nomine terms,
Sed majora dedit cognomina collibusistie'
°
E e from the trilling remains that now exist of the Temple and its appendages, we may easily conceive the very
v n
striking efeet which an approach to the circle, through either of the avenues, must have produced on the eyu and mind
of the spectator.
f Dr Stukeley says, that acan in the Chaldee signines a serpent, and has is no other than a snake. In Yorkshire they
still call' makes bags. History qfdésry, p. 32. In the British languagepen denotes a head.

ABURY-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
"
Again, the tail oi' the snake is conducted to the descending valley below Beckhampton.
"
Thus our antiquity divides itself into three great parts, which will be our rule in describing
k Th circle at Abury the forepart of the snake, leading towards Kennet, which I call
this wor . e ,
Kennet Avenue; the hinder part of the snake, leading towards Beckhampton, which I call
Beckhampton Avenue; for they may be well looked on as avenues to the great temple at Abury,
which part must be most eminently called the Temple."
We stand most highly indebted to the learned Doctor for this very ingenious development of
the m sterious plan of the Temple at Abury, and have only to regret, that at the period when he
Y
examined this work, and when it was in a much higher state of preservation than it unfortunately
d anner es eciall with regard
is at present, he had not surveyed it in a more correct an regular m , p y
to the lines and course of the avenues leading to the head and tail of the serpent. No doubt would
th have been led: to the modern antiquary; who has now to regret the non-existing means of
en
ascertaining with correctness, either the exact site of the snake's head, or the avenues leading
from it. The most valuable part of the Doctor's plans, is the record he has leil: us of the gradual
demolition of the stones that composed the Temple; for no dependance can be placed on his
general outline of the grand agger of circumvallation, as will be readily perceived by a comparison
of his plan with the one I have had engraved from actual survey by my own draughtsman.
Dr. Stukele has delineated the vallum as a regular circle, and has drawn the two concentric
Y
temples of the same form. Although the form of a circle was aimed at by the Britons, yet they
did not succeed in rendering it perfect, as will be seen by our grand plan. The rough sketch of
Aosanv also makes it irregular, as well as the disposition of the stones within the area, and those
of the two concentric temples.
It is well known that the serpent was held in great veneration by the ancients, who considered
it a symbol of the Deity, and an emblem of eternity; as such it has been variously expressed on
ancient sculpture and medals in different parts of the globe. Temples were also constructed in
the form of that animal, and called Dracontia; and Stukeley supposes that an allusion is made to
a similar temple in the following passage of Pausanias = xml ar qv 1; rmsm noun is sqm nos,

And th
unculam videas selectis lapidibus circumseptam; serpentis eaput Thebani vacant. e
same author mentions another circle of stones on the river Chimarrus:
"
Est e
lapidibus
septum."-3-
Dr. Stukeley then adds,
"
that the dracontia was a name amongst the first learned nations for the
very ancient sort of temples of which they could give no account, nor well explain their meaning
upon it. The plan on which Abury was built, is that sacred liierogram of the Egyptians and other
ancient nations, the circle and snake. The whole dgure is the circle, snake, and wings. By this
they meant to picture out, as well as they could, the nature of the Divinity. The circle meant the
supreme fountain of all being, the Father; the serpent, that divine emanation from him, which
was called the Son; the wings imported that other divine emanation from them, which was called
the Spirit, the Anima Mundi."
The Temple, (Plate l0,) supposed to represent the body of the snake, is formed by a circular agger
of earth, having its ditch withinside, contraryto the mode adopted in works of defence, and thereby
proving it to be of a religious nature. These ramparts inclose an area (according to Stukeley) of
°

ABURY-DESCRIP'1'ION OF PLATES. xxi
1400 feet in diameter; which, on the edge nearest the ditch, was set round with a row of rough,
unhewn stones, and, in the centre, was omamented with two circular temples, composed of the
same native stones. These, from their relative situations, have been distinguished by the titles of
the Northern and Southern Temples. The space of ground included within the valium, has been
estimated by the Doctor at twenty-two acres, and the outward cireumvallation, as measured by
him and the celebrated antiquary Roosa Gans, was
computed at 4800 feet. The number of stones
that formed this outward circle or
praacinctus was one hundred originally, of which, in the year
1722, when Dr. Stukeley wrote his account of Abury, there were eighteen standing, and twenty-
seven thrown down or reclining!
Two concentric circles formed the northern and southern temples: the outward circle in each
consisted of thirty stones; the inward circle of twelve. The centres of these two temples were
three hundred cubits,1~ or ive hundred and eighteen feet, nine inches asunder, and their circumfer-
ence or outside circle iifty cubits, or eighty-six feet, live inches and a half asunder in the nearest part.
The only difference which the Doctor could discover in these two temples, was, that the one
towards the south had a central obelisk, which was the kibla, towards which the faces were turned
during the performance of religious odices ; and the one towards the north, a cove, consisting of
three large stones placed with an obtuse angle towards each other. One of these fell down in 1713,
and was said to measure seven yards in length. No signs remain of.the altar which is supposed to
have lain upon the ground before the superb niche; but it appears that the central obelisk of the
southern temple existed in Stukeley's time, for he states "
its being of a circular form at the base,
of a vast bulk, twenty-one feet long, and eight feet, nine inches in diameter, and, when standing,
higher than the rest." He further adds, that "
exactly in the southern end of the line that con-
nects the two centres of these temples, is an old stone standing, not of great bulk. It has a hole
wrought in it, and probably was designed to fasten the victim in order for slaying it." This Dr.
Stukeley calls the "
Ring Stone." The original work when perfect was thus composed:

Total 189 stones.
In Mr. Aubrey's time, in the year 1663, the following number of stones is recorded as then
existing:
°
When Aubrey wrote Lis description, about the year þÿl6 ¬i,
there were thirty-one stones remaining of this outward
circle in their upright position, but he does not notice those that had fallen.
1: I have reduced the cubit to English feet, according to Dr. Stultcley's statement, p. 19, where he says
"
A ready my
stud' t'
nf having the analogism between our feet and the eubit is this: 3 foot, 5 inches and a half, makes two cnbits; a c
I0 foot, 4 inches, and s little more than half an inch, becomes the measuring reed of these ancient philosophers, being
sk cuhits, when they laid out the ground-plot of these temples.

There are seven other stones marked in Mr. Aubrey's ground-plan between the two temples,
which, from the rudeness of his design, I know not how exactly to place; and it must be observed
also, that the said person, in his rough plan, noticed the stones only that were erect, not those
reclining or fallen.
By the survey of Dr. Stukeley, in the year 1722, we learn that the numbers were as follows:
Outward circle, standing ....-..
18 stones.

» -
Total 76 stones.
Upon a survey, made by my orders in l812, I ind the numbers of stones sadly reduced,
for there are only ten standing, and ive fallen, of the outward circumvallation. Of the northern
temple two stones of the cove still remain. On its outward circle, three are left standing and one
fallen; and of the inner circle only one is standing. Of the outward circle of the southern temple
there are two upright and three prostrate stones.
Thus have I endeavoured to trace, but with antiquarian regret, the gradual progress, I will not
say of decay, but of demolition, which the works of Anna? have sustained; and the historian of a
future, and perhaps not very distant day, will very probably be under the necessity of recording its
total annihilation. The plates annexed will, I hope, convey a satisfactory idea to the public of
what Abury was in the days of its original splendour, and what it now is in the days of its unfor-
tunate decline.
For the more
perfect comprehension of the plates which illustrate the chorography of Abury and
its environs, I have subjoined the following description.
Plate 9, represents the situation of the Temple at Abury, with its two extending avenues;
Silbury Hill, the principle source of the river Kennet, the British track-way, two groups of
barrows, and the line of Roman road between Bath and Marlborough. This plate may be consi-
dered as one of the most interesting views which our island can produce. It unites monuments of
the earliest British and Roman antiquity, and will, I trust, convey a more correct and explicit idea
of Abury and its environs, than any that has heretofore been given. The plate No. VIII., of
Stukeley, is both confused and incorrect, because not drawn from actual survey.
On examining this ground-plan, we perceive a degree of symmetry, of which, except upon paper,
we could form no conception, nor for which could we give credit to the early Britons. We behold
ABURY.--DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
the grand circle placed in the centre of the picture, and the large mount of Silbury in a line oppo-
site to it.* Two avenues, like wings, expand themselves to the right and left, as if to protect the
hallowed sanctuary and the holy mount. The eastern wing or avenue terminates with a circular
temple, thus distinguishing it as a
place of peculiar eminence. From the winding form of this
work, Dr. Stukeley has very ingeniously developed the form of a
Serpent, and distinguished this
temple as one of that class called by the ancients Dracoutia.
This plan receives additional interest by comprehending some
groups of barrows, which I inves-
tigated, the principal source of the river Kennet, a small portion of the British track-way, passing
from the district of south Wiltshire throughout the whole extent ot'Berkshire,1~ and a
large portion
of the Roman road between Bath and Marlborough.
Plate 12. By this plan I have been anxious to convey to my readers a correct idea of the grand
circle at Abury in its original state, as most ingeniously developed by Dr. Stukeley. The site of
the temples is taken from nature. The British earth-work, called Oldbury Castle, appears at a
distance in the centre of the view. The object of this plate is to indicate the respective site of
each temple, and the number of stones with which each was composed; namely, thirty in the
outward, and twelve in the inner circles. The one situated towards the north, or right-hand side,
had three large upright stones in the centre of its area, designating the cove, where the altar was
placed. The centre of the southern temple was marked by an upright stone named the Obelisk, in
a. line with which, and between the temple and the outward circumvallation, was another single
stone, with a
perforation in it, and denominated by Stukeley the Ring Stone. To this he supposes
the victim was fastened previous to its sacrifice. The stones that accompanied the outward circum-
vallation, amounted to one hundred. The breaks in the valium A B point out the spots where the
two avenues issued from the central temple; the one on the left side leading to Kennet; the other
towards the centre to Beckhampton.
Plate 10, represents a
ground plan of the grand circle at Abnry, taken by Dr. Stukeley in the
year 1724 ; but from the inaccuracy of its outline, and the position of the two concentric temples,
I doubt whether this plan was taken from actual survey. It is, however, particularly interesting
to the present age, as recording the state of a circle at a distant period, when it appears to have
had eighteen stones standing, and twenty-seven fallen, of the outward circumvallation; two stand-
ing and nine fallen of the outward circle of the northern temple; one
standing and tive fallen of the
inner circle, and two out of the three large upright stones that formed the cove. Of the adjoining
southern temple, four stones of the outward circle were standing in their original situation, and
seven were fallen down; but one stone alone remained standing of the interior circle.
Plate ll. From our own accurate survey made in 1812, we shall at once be convinced of Dr.
Stukeley's error, in making this work completely circular and symmetrical, and in the position he
has given to the concentric temples within it. I have no doubt but the original British construc-
tors of this work had the circular form in view, though they did not possess the mathematical
means of drawing it to a nicety. You will observe also, that Dr. Stukeley has inclined the temples
more towards the east than they in reality do. We diEer also materially in the admeasurement of
the area within the ditch, which the Doctor makes amount to twenty acres-we to twenty-eight
°
Dr. Stukclcy remarks that the meridian line passed through the centre of the grand circle, and of Silbnry Hill; and
on making our observations and allowing for the variation of the compass, we lind it still docs the same.

acres and twenty-seven perches. We dilfer also in the circumvallation and diameter of the grand
circle, the former of which he measured in 1721, with the celebrated antiquary Roger Gale, and
calculated the compass of it, on the outside, at 4800 feet. Our measurement taken on the ridge
of the vallum amounts to 4442 feet. The learned Doctor is rather confused in his measure of the
area included within the rampart; for in one place he states the diameter at 1300, and in another
at 1400 feet. The former number agrees the best with our own measurement, which, in the
broadest part of the work, amounts to 1260 feet from A to B, and ll70 feet from C to D. Owing
to the numerous buildings and inclosed delds within the area, it is impossible to make as correct
measurements as we could wish. Those, however, laid down in this ground-plan, have been made
with every possible attention, and will fully prove that this work was not so symmetrically regular
in its constituent parts as the learned Doctor has described it.
From the stones still existing in their original position, I have been enabled to ascertain the
following measurements:
From the cove of the northern temple a, to a stone in the outward circumvallation c, is 354 feet,
six inches.
From the same stone a, to another in the outward circle of the temple L 136 feet; and from the
stone in the cove b, to one in the inner circle d, 83 feet.
From another stone g, in the outward circle of this temple, we ind the distance from it to a
stone in the circumvallation, to be 364 feet.
There are, unfortunately, no stones remaining in a situation to point out the intermediate BPBBB
between the north and south temples; but from the stone I, in the outward circle ofthe southern
temple, to the cavity of a former stone, i, we may ix the diameter of this temple at 325 feet; and
the intermediate space between the cavity and the fallen stone of the circumvallation k, at 357 feet,
and to the edge of the ditch 375 feet. The stone u, of the southern temple, and the stone o, of
the circumvallation, are only 144 feet asunder, whereas those marked iand k, are 357 feet apart-
These remarks will tend to prove the irregularity of the work; and it ought to be observed, that
the two concentric temples are not placed exactly in the centre of the area of the grand circle, but
incline rather towards the West.
Another peculiarity attends this work, which will be explained by a reference to the section at
the bottom of Plate ll. I have before mentioned the variation made use of by our British ances-
tors in the construction of earth-works, formed either for religious or military purposes; the
former having the ditch within the work, the latter on the outside. Abnry and Marden may be
adduced as splendid examples of the former; and the numerous camps which I have had surveyed
and engraved will testify the latter custom. But at Abury we observe the singnlanty of a
Bat ledge, twdlve feet wide, projecting from the vellum about half-way between it and the ditch.

This was, probably, intended for the accommodation of sitting, to the numerous spectators w o
resorted hither to the public festivals. What a grand and imposing spectacle must so extensive
and elevated an amphitheatre have presented, the valium and its declivities lined with spectators,
whilst the hallowed area was reserved for the odiciating Druids, and perhaps the higher order of

To render the illustration of this smgular relic of British antiquity more complete, I have add
several smaller plates.

of uuhewn stones, I shall now proceed to a description of the appendant parts, as noticed by
Asnav-nsscnrrrros or nares. xxv
Dr. Stukeley. 'l'he body of the snake being explained, I shall follow the track along its neck
towards the head. The Kennet avenue was intended to represent the neck of the sacred reptile,
and maybe considered as a via sacra leading up to the religious mount, by which its head was
designated. The Doctor has the sole merit of unravelling, this mystic form ; for although his
predecessor in antiquities, Mr. Aubrey, has mentioned the avenue as a
"
solemn walk leading
from Rynet to a monument upon the top of the hill," he has not hinted at the supposed design,
nor alluded to any connexion between it and the grand temple at Abury.
"
The Druids," says Dr. Stukeley, "in laying down this design, that it might produce a mag-
nificent effect suitable to so great and operose a work, studied the thing well. As this was to be
a huge picture, or
representation of an animal, they purposed to follow Nature's drawing as far as
possible. A suake's body has some variation in its thickness, as slenderer towards the neck than
at its middle. This the Druids imitated in making the avenue broader towards the southern
entrance of Abury, and drawing it narrower as it approached Overton Hill. Again; when a snake
is represented in its sinuous motion, the intervals of the stones sideways must have a variation,
as set in the inner or outward curve, so as to make them stand regularly opposite to one another;
yet this nece sarily makes some little difference in the intervals, and this too is properly regarded
in the work."
KBNNE1' AVENUE.-" The whole length of this avenue consists of a hundred stones on each side,
reaching from the valium of Abury Town, to the circular work on Overton Hill. Measuring the
breadth of it in several places, where I had the opportunity of two opposite stones being left, I
found a difference, and the like by measuring the interval of the stones sideways ; yet there was
the same proportion observed between the breadth and interval, which I found to be as two to
three; so that here by Abury Town, in that part which represented the belly of the snake, the
breadth of the avenue was
thirty-four cubits, (lilly-six feet and a hali,) and the intervals of the
stones sideways, iihsy cubits, (eighty-six feet, five inches and a halh) the proportion of two to
three; twice seventeen being thirty-four ; thrice seventeen, ifty. These thirty-four cubits (or
titty-six feet and a half) take in the entire space of two intervals of the stones of the outer great
circle of the temple of Abury within the ditch, together with the intermediate stone, which is the
entry of the avenue to the temple. When we mount up Overton Hill, the avenue grows much
narrower; and this observation helped me in the discovery ofthe purport and design of the whole
hgure of the snake, and in the nature of the scheme thereoil'
"
When I abode here for some time on purpose, for several summers together, I was
very careful
in tracing it out, knew the distinct number of each stone remaining, and where every one stood that
was wanting, which often surprised the country people, who remembered them left on the ground
or standing, and told me who had carried them away.
"
As to the stones that composed this avenue, they were of all shapes, sizes, and height, as it
happened, altogether rude. Some we measured six feet thick, sixteen in circumference. If of a
flattish make, the broadest dimension was set in the line of the avenue, and the most
sightly side
of the stone inward. The founders were sensible that all the effect desired in the case was their
bulk and regular station. When the avenue comes to the inclosures of West Kennet, it passes

Two stone now onlyremain oppositeto each other in the Kennet Avenue, by which I am enabled to give the
distance between them, which was fifty-one feet. The breadth lessens as it approachm towards the body. The lateral

through three of them, crosses a little lield-lane and the common road from Marlborough to Bath,
just after the road makes a right angle, descending from Overton hill. In this angle the Roman
road from Marlborough, coming down the hill, enters the common road. Passing the Roman road,
it traverses an
angle ofa pasture, and falls into the upper part of the same road again, and marches
through two more
pastures, all along the quickset-hedge side, so that the quick is planted in the
very middle of it. Many of the stones are seen
lying in their proper places, both in the pastures
and in the road. These stones are all thrown down or
reclining, and very large. We measured
one by the style twelve feet long, six and a half broad, and three and a half thick. At the bottom
of these pastures on the right, runs the virgin stream of Kennet, just parted from its fountain hy
Silbury Hill! One stone is still standing by a. little green lane, going down to the river. Now
our avenue marches directly up the hill across some plougbed fields, still by the hedge of the
Marlborough road, where yet stands anotherstone belonging to it. Then we are
brought tothe very
summit of the celebrated Overton Hill, properly the I-Iackpen, or head of the snake. The temple
that stood here was intended for the bead of the snake in the huge picture; and at a distance,
when seen in perspective, it very aptly represents it. It consisted of two concentric qvals, not much
dilferent from circles, their longest diameter being east and west. By the best intelligence I could
obtain from the ruins of it, the outer circle was
eighty and ninety cubits (one hundred and thirty-
eight feet, four inches, and one
hundred and fifty-Eve feet, seven inches and a half) in diameter, the
medium being eighty-live cubits, or one hundred and forty-six feet. It consisted of forty stones,
whereof eighteen remained, but only three standing. The inner was
twenty-six, and cubits
(forty-four feet, eleven inches and ahalt] and lifty-one feet, ten inches and a
half) in diameter, equal
to the interval between circle and circle : the stones were
eighteen in number, somewhat bigger than
those of the outer circle. Every body here remembers both circles entire and standing, except two
or three fallen.1'
"
This Overton Hill, from time immemorial, the country people have a
high notion all It was,
(alasl it was,) a. very few years ago, crowned with a most beautiful temple of the Druids. They
still call it the Sanctuary. I doubt not but it was an asylum in Dnxid times, and the veneration
for it had been banded down through all succession of times and people. It had suEered a
good
deal when I took the prospect of it with great Edelity, anno 1723. Then Farmer Green took most
of the stones away to his building at Beckhampton; and in the year 1724, Farmer Grilhn plougbed
half of it up; but the vacancy of every stone was most obvious, the hollow still left fresh. In the
winter of the same year the rest were carried oil; and the ground plougbed over.
"The loss of this work I did not lament alone, but all the neighbours (except the person that
gained the little dirty pro5t) were heartily grieved for it. It had a
beauty that touched them far
beyond those much greater circles in Abury Town. The stones here were not large, set pretty
clo e together; the proportions of them with the intervals, and the proportions between the two
circles, all being taken at one view, under the eye, charmed them. The great stones of the great

composed; the former writer states the outward circle to consist of twenty-two stones, and the inward of Eileen, making
a total of thirty-seven. Dr. Toope states the diameter of the large sphere to he forty yards, and the smaller one to bc

circles at Abury were not by them discerned to stand in circles, nor would they easily be pursuaded
of it; but these of the Sanctuary they still talk of with great pleasure and regret.
"
Having now," according to the words of Stukeley, "conducted one half of the forepart of the
Snake, in this mighty work, up to Overton hill, where it reposed its bulky head, and not long ago made
a most beautiful appearance," I shall proceed towards that part of the snake which designated the
rail, and which has been distinguished by the title of Beclcluzmpton Avenue, and investigated by the
same learned author in the year l722.
"Bee/Uzampton Avenue goes out of Abury town at the west point, and proceeds by the south aide
of the churchyard. Tvo stones lie by the parsonage gate on the right hand; those opposite to
them on the left hand, in a pasture, were taken away in l702, as marked in the ground-plan of
Abury. Reuben Horsal remembers three standing in the pasture. One now lies in the door of a
house in the churchyard. A little farther, one lies at the corner of the next house on the right
hand, by the lane turning ali' to the right to the bridge. Another was broke in pieces to build that
house with, in 1714; two more lie on the left hand opposite. It then passes the beck south of the
bridge. Most of the stones hereabouts have been made use of about the bridge, and the causeway
leading to it. Now the avenue passes along a lane to the left hand of the Cain road, by a stone
house called Goldsmith's Farm, and so
through Farmer GriEn's yard, through one barn that stands
across the avenue, then by another which stands on its direction. Two stones and their opposites
still lie in the foundation: immediately after this, it enters the open ploughed fields, the Cain road
running all this while north of it. If we look back, and observe the bearings of Abury steeple, and
other objects, a discerning eye finds, that it makes a
great sweep or curve northwards. The avenue,
entering the open corn-fields, runs for some time by the hedge on the right haud. When it has
crossed the way leading from South Street, we discern here and there the remains of it, in its road
to Longstone Cove. Farmer Grimn broke near twenty of the stones belonging to this part of the
avenue.
"A little way hence is a bit of heath-ground, but the plough will soon have devoured it. Here
remains a
great ban-ow called Longstone Long Barrow, and from hence we see innumerable more
barrows. The avenue continued its journey by the corn-ields. Three stones still lie by the field
road coming from South Street to the Caln road. Mr. Alexander told me he remembered several
stones standing by the parting of the roads under Beckhampton, demolished by Richard Fowler.
Then it descends by the road to Cherill, till it comes to the Bath road, close by the Roman road ;
and there in a low valley it terminates, near a fine group of barrows, under Cherill Hill, in the way
to Oldbu Camp. This point, facing that group of barrows and looking up the hill, is a most
'Y
solemn and awful place. A descent all the way from Longstone Cove, and directed to a descent a
great way farther down the Bath road, where no less than five valleys meet, and in this very point

lst. Because it would be absurd in drawing. The head of the snake was aptly represented by that
double circle on Overton Hill; but this place, the tail of the snake, admitted no such thing; and
I doubt not it grew narrower and narrower, as we observed of tha head of the snake. 2nd. Here
is not the least report of such a thing among the country people; it would most assuredly have
been well known, because every stone was demolished within memory, when I was there. I can-
not doubt but many have sufered since; and I have had very disagreeable accounts thereof sent tg
me. I apprehend this end of the avenue drew narrower in imitation of the tail of a snake, and that
one stone stood in the 'middle of the end, by way of close. The avenue took another circular
sweep in a contrary manner, as it descended from Longatone Cove, bending southward:
- --1--'

as Virgil writes of this creature. And it went over a variety of elevations and depressnres, as the
other of Kennet .Avenue ; but that terminated in a hill, as this in a valley. With great judgment
they thus laid out the ground to make the whole more
picture-like."
From the above detailed account of the Beelrhampton Avenue, we are enabled to judge, in some
degree, of the line it pursued, and this, I am sorry to say, must be our chief authority; for if I
except two of the stones which are supposed to have formed the Longstone Cove, not one belong-
ing to the avenue remains upright; but by the names of the farms, streets, roads, and barrows, we
are enabled to form a tolerably correct judgment respecting the direction of this avenue.
To the Beckhampton Avenue there appears formerly to have been an
appendage, called Long-
stone Cove, of which Dr. Stukeley has given the following account:
"This Lon tone Cove vulgatly called Longstones, is properly a Cove, as the Old Britons
85
called them, composed of three stones, like the most magniiceut one we described rn the centre of
the Northern Temple. at Abury. They are set upon the are of a circle, regarding each other with

Longtone fields from it:-Longstone Cove, because standing in the open Eelds between the Caln
road and that to Bath, is more talked of by the people of this country than the large Temple in
Abury tovn."
Mr. Aub in his Mmummta Britannica, thus mentions this fragment of antiquity:

appears that he hnd seen Mr. Aubrey's manuscripts,* and amongst them the letter before cited from
Dr. Toope. He says,
"
From this place (viz. Aubury) to West Kennet, is a walk that has been
inclosed on each side with large stones; one side, at present, wants a great many, but the other is
almost, if not wholly, entire; above which place, on the brow of the hill, is another monument,
encompassed with a circular trench, and a double circle of stones four or five foot high, though most
of them are now fallen down: the diameter of the outer circle is forty yards, and of the inner iilteen.
Between West Kennet and this place, is a walk much like that from Aubury thither, at least a
quarter of a mile in length." I-Ie then recites the circumstance of the discovery of human bones.
In the above quotation Mr. Camden has also continued the same statement with Aubrey, in men-
tioning a trench round'the circular temple on Overton Hill, and which Dr. Stukeley denies having
existed.
Having described the component parts of the Temple at Abury, consisting of the grand circle,
rehendin within its area two smallerconcentric circles; the Kennet avenue, terminating with
comp g
a third circle, supposed to indicate the head of the serpent, as the large circle indicated the body;
and also the Beckhampton avenue, which alluded to the tail of the same animal, I shall now
pro-
ceed to the description of another grand appendage, and perhaps the most mysterious part of the
whole work, namely,
Silbury Hill (Plate 14) is an artihcial mound of such immense proportions, and so deceitful in its
external appearance, that I could never have believed its havmg stood upon so much ground, had
I not ascertained the fact by an actual admeasurernent.
The learned Stukeley has, in the description of this mound, given his reins to fancy, which has
transported him beyond the regions of truth, or even probability; for he has stated, "that some
king was the founder of the temple at Abury, and that Silbury Hill was raised for his interment."
His opinion, however, is always ingenious, and therefore I lay it before my readers.
"Silbury, indeed, is a most astonishing collection of earth, artificially raised, worthy of Abury,
worthy of the King who was the Royal founder of Abury, as we may very plausibly aim. By
considering the picture of Abury Temple, we may discern, that as this immense body of earth was
raised for the sake of the interment of this great prince, whoever he was, so the Temple of Abury
was made for the sake of this tumulus ; and then I have no
scruple to aliirm, 'tis the most magnifi-
cent mausoleum in the world, without excepting the Egyptian pyramids.
"
Silbury stands exactly south of Abury, and exactly between the extremities of the two avenues,
the head and tail of the snake. The work ofAbury, which is the circle, and the two avenues which
represent the snake transmitted through it, are the great ]||2l'0g1'Nll7l||1f07l, or sacred prophylatic
character of the Divine Mind, which is to protect the dqxositum of the prince here interred. The
Egyptians, for the very same reason, frequently pictured the same hieroglyphic upon the breast of
their mummies ; and very frequently on the top and summit of Egyptian obelisks, this picture of
the serpent and circle is seen, and upon an inhnity of their monuments. In the very same manner,
this huge snake and circle, made of stones, hangs as it were brooding over Silbury Hill, in order to
bring again to a new life the person there buried. For our Druids taught the expectation of n
future life, both soul and body, with the greatest care, and made it no less than a certainty."
lf ten engineers were to survey this hill, I question if any two would perfectly agree, unless they

measured two thousand and twenty-seven feet, the diameter at top one hundred and twenty feet,
the sloping height three hundred and sixteen feet, and the perpendicular height one hundred and
seventy feet; but that part of our measurement, which will excite the most surprise, is, that this
artlhcial hill covers the space of ive acres and thiry-four perches of land.
For what purpose this huge pile of earth was raised, appears to be beyond the reach of conjec-
ture; butl think there can be no doubt that it was one of the component parts of the grand temple
at Abury, not a sepulchral mound raised over the bones and ashes of a King or Arch-druid. Its
situation opposite to the temple, and nearly in the centre between the two avenues, seems in some
degree to warrant this supposition.
In the Welsh Triads, which may be considered the earliest records we have left, perhaps some
allusion may have been made to this stately mount in the fourteenth Triad. "
The three mighty
labours of the island of Britain. Erecting the stone of Ketti ; constructing the work of Emrys;
and heaping the pile of Cyvrangon." The stone of Ketti is, upon good authority, supposed to be a
great cromleh, in the district of Gower, in Glamorganshire, still retaining the title of Maen Cetti;
and the work of Emrys, or Ambrosina,' has been applied to Stonehenge. Why may not the heap-

ing of the pile of Cyvrangon allude to Silbury? The three prima.ry cu' es o ritaxn ave een
named Gorsedd Beisgawen, Gorsedd Bryn Gwyddon, and Gorsedd Moel Evwr; upon which Mr.
William Owen, the celebrated Welsh scholar, has sent me the following explanation: "Cludarr

Cyvrangon and Gorsedd Bryn Gwyddon must have had their app on one om ,
as the names imply as much. For Cludair Cyvrangon, the heap of congregations and assem-

not that the assemblies could have been held on Bryn Gwyddon or Silbury Hill, but that
I
they were contiguous; that is, in the circle of Bryn Gwyddon, or the hill of the conspicuous or
men of the presence: so that each of these places took their names respectively from each other;
and it is thus that I identify Bryn Gwyddon and Cludair Cyvranghn in Silbury Hill and Abury." In
nearly the same state of obscurity is the mysterious circle at Abury equally involved: I say
nearly, because we have structures in our island of the same form, though not equal in
m 'tude. Eve stone circle is vulgarly attributed to the Druids, who were not the rulers
"Sm 'Y
but the priests of Britain; I cannot, therefore, attribute to them the erection of such splendid
monuments as Abwy and Slonelunge, though they probably acted a prominent part in the civil
or religious ceremonies that were performed within these circles. I rather think Abury the

Dr. Stukeley makes a similar observation.

original patriarchal method from the foundation of the world was observed, not to admit a tool
upon them.
To decide upon the period of time when the works at Abury were drst constructed, or to
hazard even a conjecture, would be an useless task, having no certain date to work upon. The
extreme rndeness of the architecture bespeaks its very remote antiquity; and, when compared
with Stonehenge, I may say with Stukeley, "The Temple of the Druids at Abury, is as much
older than the Roman times, as since the Romans to this time." But a
stronger proof of its very
early origin may be deduced from the following circumstance, recorded by Stukeley:
"
When
Lord Stawell, who owned the Manor of Abury, levelled the vallum on that side of the town next
the church, where the bam now stands, the workmen came to the original surface of the ground,
which was
easily discernible by a black stratum of mould upon the chalk. Here they found large
quantities of buck horns, bones, oyster-shells, and wood coals. The old man who was
employed
in the work says, there was a quantity of a cart-load of the. horns, that they were very rotten,
and there were very many burned bones among them." Upon which passage the learned author
makes the pertinent remark,
"
that these were remains of the sacrifices that had been performed

DILAPIDATION OF ABURY.
Having stated as
briedy and perspicuously as the nature of the subject would allow, the original
design, figure, and extent of this magnificent sanctuary, the melancholy task alone remains to
trace the causes and successive progress of its decay. When we are informed by such respectable
authority as that of Dr. Stukeley, what it was, and how wantonly and rapidly it was in his own
memory dilapidated, we shall exclaim with one accord, "dolet mermhisse." Yet we
may derive no
inconsiderable degree of alleviation, by considering that, by the persevering industry and patient
investigation of one learned individual, the whole plan of this stupendous Temple has been most
ingenionsly developed, and transmitted to the antiquaries of the present day. For although the
earliest description, and, I may add, literary description, of Abury may be justly attributed to my
conntryman Mr. Aubrey, who preceded the Doctor sixty years, yet the hieroglyphic representation
of the snake was to him both unknown and unobserved, and would probably have ever remained
in obscurity, had not the brilliant genius of a
Stukeley deciphered it at a
period when, to use his
own words,
"
he frequented this place in the very point of time, when there was a
possibility just
left of preserving the memory of it."
Now, indeed, we
may say,
"
stat magni nomimlr umbra :" for the substance is nearly gone, and
little remains but the shadow. Out of the six hundred and lifty stones which originally constituted
this surprising work, a few only now remain as a
melancholy testimony of former greatness. The
stupendous agger of earth which formed the przzcinctus of the Temple still continues to mtonish
the eye of every beholder, and to attest the grand and simple design of its founders; and to its
solid bulk and worthless materials of earth, it will probably owe that preservation and continuance
which its more valuable parts of stone can, after past experience, expect in vain.
Before I trace the progress of gradual dilapidatiou which this grand work has experienced, and
which the industry of Dr. Stukeley has preserved, it will be necessary once more to consider the
Temple in its original state; the component parts of which were as follows :
Xxxii Asuav-ncscarrrros or nuns.

Northern Temple, outward circle . 30

The inner circle of the same ..... 18
The Beckhsmpton Avenue ..... 200
Longstone Cove .....
2
The iuclosing stone of the serpent's tail . . l
Total 650 stones.
This is the grand total of stones employed in the work, of which one hundred and eighty-nine
belong to the grand and two concentric circles ; the remaining four hundred and sixty-one stones
constituted the two avenues, and the conc tric circles, designating the head of the serpent. The
following table will shew the sad dilapidations which have taken place in this work:
Original temples, one hundred and eighty-eight stones.
In Mr. Aubrey's time, A.D. 1663, seventy-three stones.
In Dr. Stukeley's time, A.D. 1722, twenty-nine stones.
In my own time, A.D. 1815, seventeen stones.
And of the Kennet Avenue, consisting originally of two hundred stones, a few only remain in
their upright position; and of the Temple, which terminated it on Overton Hill, not one stone
exists; of the Beclzhampton Avenue none remain ; but two stones of the Longstone Cove still
testify its former situation.
Dr. Stukeley informs us, that in the year 1722, when he began his researches,
"
above forty
stones were visible of the grand outward circle; seventeen of which were standing, and twenty-
seven thrown down or reclining; ten of the remainder, all contiguous, were at once destroyed by
Tom Robinson in the year 1700, and their places perfectly levelled for the sake of pastursge. In
the north entrance to the town, one of the stones, of a most enormous bulk, fell down and broke in
the mllz _
----1 nec :pro
Monte minor procnmbitl
"
It measured full twenty-two feet long. Reuben Horsal, the clerk of the parish, a sensible man
and lover of antiquity, remembers it standing; and when my late Lord Winchelsea (Heneage) was
here with me, we saw three wooden wedges driven into it, in order to break it to
"
Of the exterior circle of the northern temple, only three stones were lett standing in the time of
Stukeley, and six more lying on the ground, one of which was in the street by the inn gate.
People then alive remembered several standing in the middle of the street: they were burned, for
building, in 1711. That, at the corner of the lane going to the north gate of the town, not many
asnnv-nsscnrrrros or nares. xxxiii
years since lying on the ground, was used as a stall to lay fish on when they had a kind of market
there. They told us, that about a dozen years ago, (l7l0,) both circles were
standing, and almo t
entire. Those in the closes behind the inn were taken up a
year ago (this was when I iirst went
thither, about 1817). Farmer Green chiefly demolished them to build his house and walls at
Beckhampton.
"
Of the southern temple, several stones were destroyed by farmer John Fowler, twelve years
ago (1710) : he ovned to us that he had burned tive of them; but fourteen are still left, whereof
about half are standing. Some lie along in the pastures, two are let into the ground under~a
barn, others under the houses; one lies above ground, under the corner of a house over against
the inn; one is buried under the earth in a little garden. The cavities left by some more are
visible, in the places whereof ash-trees are set. All those in the pastures were
standing within
memory."
In the year 1720, Dr. Stukeley saw several stones taken up from that part of the Kennet
Avenue near the inclosures, and broke for building, fragments still remaining, and their places
fresh turfed over for the sake of pasture.
"
John Fowler, who kept the ale-house hard by, demolished many of these stones for buming.
The ale-house, (the White Hart,) and the walls about it, were built nearly of one stone.
"The HackpenTemple owes its destruction to farmer Green. Farmer Grimn broke near
twenty
stones of the Beckhampton Avenue.
"
Thus," in the enthusiastic language of our
author,
"
this stupendous fabric, which for some
thousands of years has braved the continual assaults of weather, and by the nature of it, when left
to itselg like the pyramids of Egypt, would have lasted as
long as the globe, has fallen a sacrifice
to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village, unluclcily placed within it."
Various arts and devices were
employed at diierent times in the destruction of these stones :
Dr. Stukeley informs us, that just before he visited Abury, to endeavour at preserving the memory
of it, the inhabitants were fallen into the custom of demolishing the stones, chiedy out of covet-
ousuess of the little area of ground each stood on.
"
F'u'st they dug great pits in the earth and burned the stones: the expense of digging the grave
was more than thirty years' purchase of the spot they possessed when standing. After this, they
found the knack of burning them, which has made most miserable havoc of this famous temple.
One Tom Robinson, the Herostratus of Abury, is particularly eminent for this kind of execution,
and he very much glories in it. The method is, to
dig a
pit by the side of the stone till it falls
down; then to burn many loads of straw under it. They draw lines of water along it when heated,
and then, with smart strokes of a
great sledge hammer, its prodigious bulk is divided into many
lesser parts. But this alto dijlz' commonly oosts thirty shillings in ire and labour, sometimes
twice as much. They own, too, 'tis excessive hard work ; for these stones are often eighteen feet
long, thirteen broad, and six thick ; that their weight crushes the stones in pieces, which they lay
under them to make them lie hollow for burning; and for this purpose they raise them with timbers
of twenty foot long and more, by the help of twenty men, but ohen the timbers were rent in
pieces."-Sruxnnmfs Alamy, p. 15.
At p. 25, the same author informs us,
"
that in the year 1694, Walter Stretch, father of one of
the present inhabitants, found out the way of demolishing these stones by tire. He exercised this
at Brat on one of the stones standing in the street before the inn, belonging to the outward circle
of the southern temple. That one stone, containing twenty loads, built the dining-room end ofthe

inn. Since then, Tom Robinson, another Herostratus ofthe place, made cruel havoc among them.
He owned to ns, that two of them cost eight pounds in the execution. Farmer Green ruined
many of the southern temple to build bis houses and walls at Beckhampton. Since then, many
others have occasionally practised the sacrilegioue method, and most of the houses, walls, and
onthouses of Abury town are raised from these materials. Sir Robert Halford resented this destruc-
tion of them, and Reuben Horsall, parish clerk, had a due veneration for these sacred remains, and
assisted me with the best intelligence he was able to give."
Of very late years I do not imagine the dilapidations of the Temple have been very great, as the
detached semen stones on the meadows and down are now broken ihr buildings, and for the use of
th ad . As an anti ua and justly proud of the British antiquities which Wiltshire possesses,
¢1'° 5 'I 1'Y»
in a
degree far superior to that of any other county, may I be allowed to express a wish, that
what has hitherto escaped the wear of time and dilapidations of man, may still contmue for many a
long revolving year to call bsclr the recollection of past times, and to excite the admiration of the
present, as well as of many a succeeding generation?

Such is the inscription which every true lover of antiquity would wish to have had left within
the hallowed sanctuary of Abury 5 but now, alas! such an admonition would be announced too
late, and prove entirely fruitless.

ROWLDRICH.
THE following description of Rowldrich is taken fiom Dr. S'l`UKELEY'S work
entitled A Descrnntion qfA6ur_y, Vol. I. pp. 10, et
seg.
I SHALL begin with Rowlright, or rather Rozvldrich ; and, as a
specimen of what requisites are
sought for in these inquiries, I shall draw them up in a kind of order ; which may be useful in all
researches of this sort.
1. A situation on
high ground, open heaths, by heads of rivers. Rowldrich is a
Temple of the
Druids of the first kind, a circular work, which has been often taken notice of in print, lying in
the _north-west part of Oxfordshire, upon high ground, where the counties of Oxford, Warwick, and
Gloucester meet. It is near the town of Chipping Norton. Two rivers rise here, that run in quite
contrary directions ; the Evenlade, towards the south part of the kingdom, which, joining the Isis
below Woodstock, visits the great luminary of Britain, Oxford, and then meets the Thames at
Dorchester, the ancient qriscopal see of the Mercian kingdom. At this Dorchester are ine
remains both of Saxon Church antiquity, of Roman, and of British. The inquisitive that prefer
our own country antiquities to the vain tour of foreign, will ind much of curious amusement there.
The other river, Stour, runs from Rowldrich directly north, to meet the Aron ut Stratford,
thence to the Severn Sea. So that Rowldrich must needs stand on
very high ground; and to those
who attentively consider the place itself, it appears to be a
large cop'd hill, on the summit of an
open down; and the Temple, together with the Arch-druid's barrow hard by, stands on the very
tip of it, having a descent every way thence; and an extensive prospect, especially into Glouces-
tershire and Warwickshire. The country hereabouts was
originallyan open, barren heath ; and
underneath, a
quarry of a kind of ragstone. At present, near here are some inclosures, which have
been ploughed up. The major part of our antiquity remains, though many of the stones have been
carried away within memory, to make bridges, houses, &c.
2. It is an
open temple of a circular form, made of stones set upright in the ground. The
stones are rough and unhewn, and were (as I apprehend) taken from the surface of the ground.
I saw stones lying in the lield near Norton, not far olf, of good bulk, and the same kind as those of
our
antiquity. There are such in other places bereabouts, whence the Druids took them ; though,
in the main, carried of ever since, for building and other uses.
3. We observe the effect of the weather upon these works. This we are
treating of stands in
the corner of the hedge of the inclosure, near the northem summit of the hill-" a
great monument
of antiquity," says the excellent Mr. Camden: "anumher of vastly great stones placed in a circular
ligure. They are of unequal height and shape, very much ragged, impaired, and decayed by time."
Indeed, as from hence we must form some
judgment of their age, we
may pronounce them not
inferior to any in that respect; corroded, like worm-eaten wood, by the harsh jaws of time, and
P 2
ROWLDB.ICH_DESCRIPTION' OF PLATES.
that much more than Stonehenge, which is no mean argument of its being the work of the
Druids.
4. We are led to this conclusion from the name. Mr. Camden calls them Rolle-rich stones.
Dr. Holland in his notes says, in a book in the Exchequer, (perhaps he means Doomsday Book)
the town adjacent (whence its name) is Rollendrich: if it was wrote exactly, I suppose it would
be Rholdrwyg, which means the Druids' wheel or circle. Rhwyll likewise, in the British, is can-
celli ; for these stones are set pretty near together,so as almost to become a continued wall, or
cancellus. Further, the word Roilig, in the old Irish language, signihes a church; then it imports
the Druids' church, chancel, or temple, in the Brat acceptation of the word. We may call this
place the Gilgal of Britain, to speak in the oriental manner, a word equivalent to the Celtic Rlwl,
a wheel or circle, which gave name to that famous camp or fortress where the host of Israel Brat
pitched their tents in the land of Canaan, after they passed the river Jordan in a miraculous manner
dry- shod, as it is described, in the sublimest manner, and equal to the dignity of the subject, in
Joshua iv.
5. We may justly infer that this is a temple of the Druids, from the measure it is built upon. In
a letter from Mr. Roger Gale to me, dated from Worcester, Aug. 19, 1719, having been to visit this
antiquity at my request, he tells me, the diameter of the circle is 35 yards. So the Bishop of
London writes,
"
The distance at Stonehenge from the entrance of the area to the temple itself is 35
yards ;" so the diameter of Stonehenge is 35 yards. We suppose this is not measured with a
mathematical exactness; hut when we look into the comparative scale of English feet and cubits,
we discern 60 cubits ofthe Druids is the measure sought for. The diameter of the outward circle
of Stonehenge and this circle at Rowldrich are exactly equal.
The circle itself is composed of stones, of various shapes and dimensions, set pretty near
together, as
may best be seen by the drawing, Table XV. '1`hey are Hattish, about 16 inches thick.
Originally there seem to have been 60 in number ; at present there are 22 standing, few exceeding
4 foot'in height, but one in the very north point much higher than the rest, 7 foot high, 5* broad.
There was an entrance to it from the north-east, as is the case at Stonehenge. Ralph Sheldon, Esg.
dag in the middle of the circle at Rowldrich, but found nothing.
6. Another argument of its being a. Druid temple is taken from the barrows all around it,
according to the constant practice in these places. To the north-east is a
great tumulus, or barrow,
of a long form, which I suppose to have been of an Arch-druid. Between it and our temple isa
huge stone standing upright, called the King Stone; the stone 8 foot high, 7 broad; but the bar-
row has had much dug away from it. It is now about 60 feet in length, 20 in breadth, Hattish
at top.
I know not whether there were more stones standing originally about this barrow, or that this
belonged to some part of the administration of religious oices in the temple, as a single stone.
In the same
place may be seen another barrow, but circular, below the road to the left hand, on
the side of the hill. Under it is a spring-head, running eastward to Long-Compton. This barrow
has had stone-work at the east end of it. Upon this same heath eastward, in the way to Ban-
bury, are many barrows of diEerent shapes, within sight of Rowldrich; particularly near a place
called Chapel: on the heath, is a large, dat, and circular tumulus ditched shout, with a small stump
in the centre. This is what I call a Druid's barrow ; many such near Stonehenge, some whereof
I opened; a small circular barrow a little way of it. There are on this heath, too, many circular,
dish-like cavities, as near Stonehenge ; we may call them barrows inverted.
R0WLDRICH1DESCRIP'.I'ION OF PLATES. xxxvii
Not far from the Druids' barrow I saw a square work, such as I call Druids' courts or houses.
Such near Stonehenge and Abury. It is a
place of 100 cnhits square, double ditched. The earth
of the ditches is thrown inward between the ditches, so as to raise a terrace, going quite round.
The ditches are too inconsiderable to he made for defence. Within are seemingly remains of stone
walls. It is within sight of the temple, and has a Bae prospect all around, being seated on the
highest part of the ridge. A little farther is a small round barrow, with stone work at the east end,
like that before spoken of near Rowldrich ; a
dry-stone wall or fence running quite over it, across
the heath.
Return we nearer to the temple, and we see, 300 paces directly east from it, in the same lield, a
remarkable monument much taken notice of: it is what the old Britons call a kist-vaen, or stone
chest; I mean the Welsh, the descendants of those invaders from the continent, Belgfe, Gauls, and
Cimbrians, who drove away the aboriginal inhabitants, that made the works we are now treating
of, still northward. Hence they gave them those names from appearances; as Rowldrich, the
wheel or circle of the Druids; as
Stonehenge, they called choir gaur, the giants' dance; as our
Saxon ancestors called it Stonehenge, the hanging stones, or stone gallows :
every succession of
inhabitants being still further removed from a true notion and knowledge of the things.
Our Kiel-vasn is represented in plates XVI. and XVII. One shews the foreside, the other the
backside ; so that there needs but little description of it. It is composed of six stones, one
broader for the back part, two and two narrower for the sides, set square to the former; and above
all, as a cover, a still larger. The opening is full west to the temple, or Rowldrich. It stands
on a round tumulus, and has a fine prospect south-westward down the valley, where the head of
the river Evenlode runs. I persuade myself this was
merely monumental, erected over the grave
of some
great person there buried, most probably the king of the country, when this temple was
built. And if there was any use of the building, it might possibly be some way accommodated to
some anniversary commemoration of the deceased, by feasts, games, exercises, or the like, as we
read in the classic poets, who describe customs ancienter than their bwn times. Plate XVIII.
represents another Kist-vaen in Clatford bottom near this place.
Near the Arch-druid's barrow, by that called the Kingsrone, is a
square plat, oblong formed on
the tur£ Hither, on a certain day of the year, the young men and maidens customarily meet, and
make merry with cakes and ale. And this seems to be the remains of the very ancient festival
here celebrated in memory of the interred, for whom the long barrow and temple were made. This
was the sepulchre of the Arch-druid founder. At Euston, a little way oil, between Neal Euston
and Fulwell, by the side ofa bank or tumulus, stands a great stone, with other smaller. It is half
a mile south-west of Euston church. A famous barrow at Lineham, by the banks of the Evenlode.
7. Mr. Camden writes further concerning our
antiquity, that the "
country people have a fond
tradition that they were once men, turned into stones. The highest of all, which lies out of the
ring, they call the king. Five larger stones, which are at some distance from the circle, set close
together, they pretend were knights; the ring were common soldiers." This story the country
people, for some miles round, are very fond og and take it very ill if any one doubts of it; nay,
he is in danger of being stoned for his unbelie£ They have likewise rhymes and sayings re-
lating thereto. Such-like reports are to be met with in other like works of our Druid temples.
They savour of the most ancient and heroic times. Like Perseus, turning men into stones ; like
Cadmus, producing men from serpents' teeth; like Ducalion, by throwing stones over his head,
and such like.
xxxviii nownnarcu-nsscarrrlon or stuns.
8. We may very reasonably amrm, that this temple was built here, on account of this long bar-
row; and very ohen in ancient times temples owed their foundation tosepulchres, as well as now.
Clemens Alexaudrinus and Eusebius both allow it; and it is largely treated oi in Schedius and
other authors. It is aeommon thing among these works of our Druids, and an argument that
this is a work of theirs. I shall only make two observations therefrom. I. That it proceeded
from a strong notion in antiquity of a future state, and that in respect of their bodies as well as
souls 5 for the temples are thought prophylactic, and have a
power of protecting and preserving
the remains of the dead. 2. That it was the occasion of consecrating and idolizing of dead heroes,
the first species of idolatry; for they by degrees advanced them into those deities of which these
figures were symbols.
Thus we pronounce Rowldr-ich s Druid temple, from a concurrence of all the appearances to be
expected in the case; from its round form, situation on high ground, near springs, on an extended
heath; from the stones taken from the surface of the ground, from the name, hom the measure
it is built on, from the wear of the weather, from the barrows of various kinds about it, from
ancient reports, from its apparent conformity to those patriarchial temples mentioned in Scripture.
This is the demonstration to be expected in such antiquities; nor shall I spend time in examining
the notion of its belonging to Rollo the Dane, and the like. Mr. Camden had too much judgment
to mention it. It is confuted in the annotations to Brilannia, and in Selden's notes on
Di-ayton's
POQ/'Al/)l:0f|, page 224. And let this suiiice for what I can say upon this curious and ancient mo-
nument ; the irst kind and most common of the Dniid temples, a plain circle, of which there are
innumerable all over. the Britannic isles, being the original form of all temples till the Mosaic
tabernacle.

NEW GRANGE.
A nsscruvrros of the Sepulchral Monument at New Grange, near Drogheda, in the County of
Meath, in Ireland. By THOMAS Powuam.. Esq. In a Letter to the Rev. Gregory Sharp,
D.D., Master of the Temple.-Read at the Society of Antiquaries, London, June 2l,28, l770.
By the civility of Mr. Boyd, merchant of Dublin, who went with me to Drogheda, I was intro-
duced to the acquaintance of Dr. Norris, master of the great school there; who very politely
otfering to conduct me to New Grange, I prolited of so agreeable an opportunity.
Our road ran on the north and west side of the river Boyne. After crossing a little brook which
runs into it, we passed on to the seat of Lord Netterville, in the county of Meath. The whole of the
land on the north and west side of the Boyne is high ground. The site of Lord Netterville's
house, where the river and land make a dexure, is more eminent than the rest. On the left
hand of the road as you ascend the hill, is an ancient monument, composed of a circle of large un-
hewn stones, set ou end; with the remains of a kist-vaen forming the north side thereof. This is
undoubtedly an erection of Druid superstition. I paced the diameter of this circle, and, as well as
I recollect, it is not above one and twenty feet. The stones are large and massive, and about Eve
and six feet high. There remain eight of these stones together in one
part of the circle ; two in
another part; and one
by itself. On the left hand from the entrance into the circle, lies a
large
Hat stone, which seems to have been either the top of a kist-vaen or a crdmlech.
About a hundred yards on the same line, further from the road, are the vestigia of an oval camp,
which is certainly Danish. As the road advances,just on the brow of the hill, and before it de-
scends again to New Grange, there is on the left hand a very large tumulus or barrow, under
which (report says) there is a cave like that at New Grange. It is now (like the mount at Marl-
borough) improved into s garden mount, planted with trees; and on the top of it is built a
modern ornamental temple. From hence the road descends, for more than a mile, to New Grange.
From this pile I made a hasty sketch of the great barrow at New Grange, and its environs.
The lanes about it are
planted with rows of trees; and the country forms an ornamental land-
scape, uncommon in Ireland. The Pyramid, if I may so call it, built on a rising ground, and heav-
ing its bulky mass over the tops of the trees, and above the face of the country, with dimensions
of a scale greater than the objects which surround it, appears, though now but a ruinous frustum of
what it once was, a
superb and eminently magnificent monument.
Many of the most remote antiquities of our isle are remains of the customs of those different races
of people possessing the same regions at diferent periods of time, and living, in succession one
after another, under diferent modes of life. Under a general reference, therefore, to these customs,
I beg leave to conduct you to this great Sepulchral Pyramid which I am now about to describe.
We shall have occasion to use such reference, in the explication of the dilferent parts of this
monument.
Yi NEV GRANGE-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
As most, if not all, the barrows which we know of (a few small carneddas excepted), are formed
f arth ou will u n
your approach to this, be surprised to End it a pyramid of stone, compiled
o c _' po _
of pebble or cogl; stones, such as are
commonly used in paving. The labour of collecting such
a prodigious mass of materials, although they had lain near the spot, would have been a work al-
most inconceivably great. But what conceptions must we have of the expense of labour, of time,
and of the number of hands, necessary to such a work, when we understand that these stones
must have been brought hither not less than twelve or fourteen miles from the sea-coast, at the
mouth of the Boyne! Such materials lie there; but I ann assured by gentlemen who know the
country where this monument is erected, that there are no such stones as it is composed of to be
found within land. When I add to all this, that, upon a calculation raised from the most moderate
state of its measurements, the solid contents of this stupendous pile amount to one hundred and
eighty-nine thousand tons' weight of stone, your astonishment must, I think, be raised to the
highest pitch.
Before I proceed to give a more full and particular description hereof, it may not be improper to
take notice of such accounts as have already been given of this monument. That by Mr. Edward
Lhwyd is conceived in too general terms; and that given by Dr. Thomas Molineux, irst published
in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 335 and 336, and afterwards in his discourse on Danish
Forts in Ireland, annexed to the Natural History of Ireland, and copied into the late editions of
Ware's History, was composed from a narrative and drawing given by Dr. Samuel Molineux, a
young gentleman of the college of Dublin. The measurements are not exact; his observations
upon particular parts are hasty, inattentive, and not just; and the drawings are mere deformities,
made out at random. The account, therefore, which the Doctor gives, is of that kind which one
might expect from such imperfect materials. Mr. Wright says he was on the spot and in the cave,
as it is called, and made some drawings of the cells in it; yet the account which he gives in his
Louthiana is but short, and little more than a
transcript from Dr. Molineux; which is the more to
he regretted, as he has an eye of precision, is an excellent draughtsman, and has been very accurate
and distinct in all the other accounts which he has hitherto published.
Besides the more general observations and measurements which I made on the spot, and the
sketches which I took of the whole, and of its parts, I engaged Dr. Norris to employ a
person to
make a
particular measurement of the base and altitude of the Pyramid; and to measure the gallery
and cave it formed. This was done by Mr. Samuel Bouie, a
land-surveyor of this part of the
country. I have every reason to conlide in his actual measurements, though I have some reason to
doubt of his projection of the altitude. The form, indeed, of the ground on which this Pyramid
stands, makes that projection a matter of some
dimculty. Dr. Molineux, who agrees nearly with
Mr. Bouie in the actual measurements, which I find to correspond with my own notes, says, that
the altitude is 150 feet, while Mr. Bouie makes it but 42. Neither of these accounts can be right.
But Mr. Bouie, in my opinion, approaches nearest to the truth; for, from a
projection made upon a
medium of the measurements given by Dr. Molineux, and those at dilferent times received from
Mr. Bouie, I make the altitude to be about 56 feet from the horizontal line of the door from the
cave; to which adding the segments of the curve of the ground on which it stands, being about I4
feet more, I make the altitude of the whole about 70 feet. This
'projection forms a figure of the
same contour as the draught which I sketched on the spot gives; and as
my eye, from a habit
acquired of drawing from nature, will judge of outlines and angles with an accuracy nearly
approaching to mensurement,I had myself from this concurrence the rather more couirmed in
NEW GRANGE-'DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. xli
my opinion. How Dr. Molineux could be led into the mistake that the altitude was 150 feet I
cannot conceive. For if this monument, which is at present but a ruin of what it was, could be
supposed ever to have been a
perfect pyramid, it could not be much above 100 feet, as
any one,
continuing the lines of the sides to their intersections, will see. But even that supposition cannot
take place, as Dr. Molineux mentions the circumference of the top nearly in the same numbers as
Mr. Bouie makes it; and that the top so described by him was the perfect inishing of this monu-
ment is plain, as he mentions that one of the large columnal unhewn stones was set upon it.
In Plate 19, the figure B gives the plan of the base drawn according to Mr. Bouie's stations in
measuring it; but you must understand, that the periphery of the real figure is curvilinear, not
rectilinear. This base covers about two acres of ground. C is the plan of the cave and of the
gallery leading to it, as it bears 24° N. W.; D is the section of the pyramid, and of the ground on
which it stands, projected from a medium of the various numbers I have received. The whole is
laid down by a scale of 84 feet to an inch.
This pyramid was encircled at the base with a number of enormous unhewn stones, set upright,
of which ten were remaining when I was on the spot. These you will see marked in the plan.
Nine of them are still in their erect posture, the tenth is thrown down. I measured many of these
stones, and found them from seven to nine feet high above ground; that which is thrown down,
and lies quite out of the ground, measured near eleven feet. Their forms are various and anomalous.
Upon a rough estimate, they may be supposed to weigh from eight to twelve tons each. Mr.
Lhwyd says, there was a stone of considerable hulk erected on the summit of this pyramid, of the
same anomalous form as the others, but of less size. But there were no remains of such a stone
when I was there. Many such stones as these are found on the sea-coast, as Dr. Norris, in order
to a particular inquiry made by me, informs me; and these must certainly have been brought
from thence.
The pyramid, in its present state, is, as I said, but a ruin of what it was. It has long served as
a stone quarry to the country round-about. All the roads in the neighbodrhood are paved with its
stones; immense quantities have heen taken away. Mr. Lhwyd mentions the particular instance
which gave occasion to the discovery of the gallery that leads to the cemetery. The mouth of this
gallery, under the perfect state of the monument, lay concealed and shut up near 40 feet within the
body of the pile. The dotted line a, b, in the section D, Plate 19, gives the supposed perfect side.
The triangle a, b, c, is the hollow space from whence, as from a stone quarry, the stones have been
taken; b, marks the mouth of the gallery. This gallery is formed bylarge dag-stones. Those
which compose its sides are set on
edge, and are of different altitudes, from two to seven feet high,
and of various breadths, from two to three feet, six inches, as
may be seen in the plan, Plate 20.
The thickness of each could not he taken with any certainty; but some of the large ones which
form the cemetery are from one foot and a half to two feet thick.
Figure I and 2 in Plate 20, which lies across, and forms part of the top or roof of the gallery, is
thirteen feet long, and dve feet broad; another at L is eleven feet long, and four feet, six inches
broad.
This gallery at the mouth is three feet wide, and two feet high. At thirteen feet from the mouth
it is only two feet, two inches wide at the bottom, and of an indeterminate width and height. Four
of the side stones, beginning from the iith to the right hand, or eastern aide, stand now leaning
over to the opposite side; so that here the passage is scarcely permeable. We made our way by
creeping on our hands and knees till we came to this part. Here we were forced to turn upon our

sides and edge ourselves on with one elbow and one foot. After we had passed this strait, we

observed that on one of the side stones were the traces of a spiral line; but whether meant for

any em e ,
Were I to indulge my own conjecture, I should rather suppose, that this stone, as well as some
others in the compilation of this structure, had fonnerly belonged to some other monument of a
h re ancient date and that they were brought from the sea-coast indiscriminately with the
muc mo ,
rest of the materials, and without knowledge of their contents, as well as without reference to the

. .
ed
place they were here fixed in, being placed Just as the shape of the stone suited the place assign
it. The distance from A to B in the ground»plot, Plate 20, Figure 3, is 42 feet ; from B to C is
19 feet 4 inches; from C to D, 19 feet, 2 inches; from E to F, 21 feet. You will observe from
I
the plan, that although the cemetery is an irregular polygon, yet it is such an octagon as might be
d t b formed with such rough materials into so rude a style of architecture. The dome
suppose o e
of this cave or cemetery springs at various unequal heights, from eight to nine and ten feet on
. .

f
diferent sides, forming at Erst a
covxng of eight sides. At the height of fifteen or sixteen ect,
th th and south sides of this coving run to a point like a gore, and the covmg continues its
e nor
spring with six sides; the east side coming to a point next, it is reduced to ive sides, the west

and the dome ends and closes with four sides ; not tied with a key stone, but capped with a

formed by keystoues, whose sides are the radii of a circle, or of an elhpsxs converging
It is combined with great long dat stones, each of the upper stones projecting a little beyond the
end of that immediately beneath it; the part projecting, and weight supported by it, bearing so
'
th ral
small a proportion to the weight which presses down the part supported, the greater e gene
weight is which is laid upon such a cove, the firmer it is compacted in all its parts. This will
appear without any further explanation, from a bare inspection of Figure 1 and 2 in Plate 20.
The eight sides of this polygon are thus formed: The aperture which forms the entrance, and
the three niches or tabernacles, make four sides, and the four imposts the other four. Upon the
3
whole, this cemetery is an octagon with a dome of about 20 feet in height, and of an area which

New cannon-nescarrrxon or rnsrns. xliii
made my sketch, rather convex than as it is described by others, and as given to me
by Mr,
Bouie. But herein I may have been misled by the earth which lay about it. As this bason seems
to have the sides of its concave duted, I desired particularly that the surveyor might clean it and
wash it; that, if there was any thing singular, it might be observed. Nothing particular was found
there; so take the draught just as I drst sketched it. The bason on the right hand, as the sur-
veyor gives me the measure, is four feet, nine inches, by three feet, live. The surveyor's measure
of the base is six feet, by ive feet, four inches. The bason in the leit hand tabernacle is exactly'
of the same form as the other; its dimensions four feet, four inches, by three feet, seven. In the
narrow point of its oval it is two feet broad. Dr. Molineux, in his account of this cemetery, says,
that there was a rock bason in each niche; and, as that stone which I have described as a base, is
a concave, forming a bason like the rest, it may, at the lirst view, seem to give some foundation for
this account. But Mr. Lhwyd says expressly,
"
that in each cell or apartment on the right and
left hand was a broad shallow bason of stone; the bason on the right hand stood within another;
that on the left hand was single; and in the apartment straight forward there was none at all."
As this account was prior to the Doctor's, and as both the drawing and plan from which the
Doctor wrote, describe this base stone (which one might suppose to be the third bason) as
actually
then standing as a base to the right hand bason, it is clear that the Doctor was mistaken; and,
indeed, a bare view of the inaccurate plan from which he wrote his description, shews how that
mistake arose. He was informed of the basons in the side niches, and had a deformed draught of
the right hand one. In pursuing his description from inspection of the plan, it is plain that he
mistook the plan of the floor stone of the northern niche for that ofa bason like that before described;
and by looking on that plan, one sees how easily he might so do. I have employed a more
parti-
cular precision in describing the peculiar differences in the three several niches or Kistvains.
Before I close this description, I would just observe, that there are on some of the stones which
form the sides and backs of the Kistvaéns, lines cut in a spiral form. In the front edge of one of
the stones which form the top of the Kistvaéns, there appear some lines forming a kind of trellis-
work, in small lozenges, such as are not unfrequently seen on Danish monuments and crosses.-

The inscriptions which Mr. Pownal found in the cave, in consequence of the old
languages of Ireland being unknown to him, appearing to me not to be depended upon,
I have inserted in lieu of them the following very accurate description of them given by
Col. Vallencey. Engravings of them, numbered fiom 1 to 7, will be found in Plate 19.
INSCRIPTIONS AT NEW GRANGE.
The most ancient inscriptions now remaining in Ireland, are undoubtedly those found in
the tumulus or mount of New Grange, near Drogheda, in the county of Meath. This curious
remnant of antiquity, which appears to have been a sepulcbre and temple, we shall defer giving a
particular description of, until we treat fully on the temples and sepulchral monuments of the
ancient Irish, in a subsequent number of this collectanea, conining ourselves here to the explana-
tion of the several inscriptions found in the cave or dome situated inthe centre Of the m011L
The inscription contained in No. 1, consistdvgf ri.spiral line on one of the upright Stones com-
posing the right side of the gallery, and represents the Supreme Being, or Active Principle.

xliv New onarxon-nsscazrrros or PLATE3»
No. 2
ls found on another stone on the same side of the gallery, and is written in the symbolic and
ancient Ogham Croabh characters. The three symbols represent the Supreme Being or First
Cause; hut, being repeated three times, shew them to signify the Great Eternal Spirit. The
Ogham is evidently written in the Ciom fa site, from the right to the left, and from the left to thc
right, (Bun-ps-||8»»), signifying Ae, that is, to the He, for é in old Irish and Celtic signilies He, or
the masculine gender, whence this inscription is, To Him who is the Universal Spirit.
No. 3
Is found on the front of the covering-stone of the east tabernacle, and is written in symbolic
characters, signifying The House of God. It is remarkable, that all the ancient altars found in
Ireland, and now distinguished by the name of Cromleabs, or sloping stones, were originally
called Botal, or The House of God ; and they seem to be of the same species as those mentioned in
the book of Genesis, called by the Hebrews Bethel, which has the same sigoiication as the Irish
Bothsl. The tabernacles in the mount of New Grange have an exact conformity to the Cromleahs
found in different parts of the kingdom.
No. 4
Is found on the south side of the east tabernacle, written in the Ogham and symbolic characters.
The symbol is that representing the earth and universal nature, and with the Ogham, which is
written from the left to the right, makes a mor dn Ops, that is, To the Great Mother Ops, or to the
Great Mother Nature.
No. 5
Is found on the front stone of the north tabernacle, and represents chance, fate, or providence.
No. 6
Is found on the north stone of the west tabernacle, written in the Ogham Bobeloth, and Ogham
Croah characters, from the right to the left; the drst character being an Ogham CE, the second a
Bobeloth M, and the others in the Ogham Croabh are G, U, H, making Oengull Oenguih, that is,
The Sepulchre of the Hero.
No. 7
Is found on a stone on the left of the gallery, is writt in the Ogham, from right to left, ter-
minating in the Ciom fe cite, being ajisr, daim, sine, that is, men, oxen, swine; probably speci-
fying the several species of victims sacrihced at this temple in honour of universal nature, pro-
vidence, and the manes of the hero interred within, and to whom the three tabernacles appear to
have been dedicated, and which were the principal objects of worship amongst all the Celtic
tribes.
At what time this tumnlus was erected cannot be ascertained: it probably was not long before
the art of writing became universal in the island, as all the diierent species are contained in the
inscription, if it was not erected bythe founder of the convention of Taragh himselg as a
temple
and sepulchre for his family, towards the close of the second century. It was, however, constantly
distinguished by the name of Oenguls or
Oengus, viz., The Tomb of the Chiefs or Heroes, by the
body of the people; and we find it mentioned in the Chronicon Scotorum, with the grove which
surrounded it, by the name of Ffodll
Amtgusa, or the Grove of Aongus, or rather, the Grove of the
Sepulchre of the Heroes; though several persons have imagined that a chief of the name of Aongus
or
Oengus wasinterred there.-Vausuczv, Col. Reb. Eb. Vol. II. p. 211.

GERMAN MONUMENTS.
IN Westphalia and East Friesland are some very curious examples of Tolmen. In
Plate 22, fiom Kn:Ysr.zn's Antiquities, is the representation ofone near Drontheim. The
stones are from sixteen to twenty-five feet long, and from four to six feet thick, and the
superincumbent stones from twenty to fifty feet in circumference. KzYsr.an, Ant.
Sep. p. 6.
In Plate 28 is represented another on the top of a mountain near Helmstadt.

FIRE TOWERS OF SCOTLAND.
Trraoucnoucr Scotland and Ireland there are scattered great numbers of Round
Towers, which have hitherto puzzled all antiquarians, and which will yet, I fear, continue
to set them all at defiance. They have of late obtained the names in general ofjre
towers. The Plate, No. 24-, represents the view of one of them at Brechin, in Scotland.
It consists of sixty regular courses of hewn stone, of a brighter colour than the adjoining
church. It is 85 feet high to the cornice, whence rises a low spiral-pointed roof of stone,
with three or four windows, and on the top a vane, making 15 feet more, in all 100 feet
from the ground. The height of these towers diH`ers in different places. Many in
Ireland vary from 35 to 100 feet high. One at Abernethy is 75 feet. This, as well
as the one at Brechin, is about 48 feet in external circumference; a measure seldom
exceeded in Ireland. One at Ardmore has lhsciae at the several stories, which all the
rest, both in Ireland and Scotland, seem to want, as well as stairs, having only abut-
ments, whereon to rest timbers and ladders. Some have windows regularly disposed,
others only at the top. Some, like those at Brechin, have stone roofs, which in others
are ruined. Some have a kind of base at the bottom, which others have not. One at
Kineth, in the county of Cork, has the lowest of its six tories an hexagon! The
situation with respect to the churches also varies. Some in Ireland stand from 25 to
125 feet from the west end of the church. This at Brechin is included in the S. W.
angle ofthe ancient cathedral, to which it communicates within by adoor.1° There have
been numerous discussions respecting the purposes for which these towers were built:
they are
generally adjoining to churches, whence they seem to be of a
religious nature.
Mr Vallencey considers it as a settled point that they were an
appendage to the Druid-
ical religion, and were in fact towers for the preservation of the sacred iire ofthe Druids
or
Magi. To this a
part of Mr. Gough's description of Brechin Tower, which I now
present to my reader, raises an insuperable objection.
On the west-front of the tower are two arches, one within the other in relief. On the point
of the outermost is a crucifix, and between both, towards the middle, are
figures of the Virgin Mary
and St. John, the latter holding a cup with a lamb. The outer arch is adorned with knobs, and
within both is a small slit or loop. At bottom of the outer arch are two beasts couchant. If one
of them by his proboscis was not evzilently an
elephant, I should suppose them the supporters of the
°

Scotch arms. Parallel with the cruciix are two plain stones, which do not appear to have had
any thing upon them. Here is not the least trace of a door in these arches, nor any where else,
except that in the church, which faces the north, as in
the Abernethy Tower.
Here, if' I mistake not, is a
complete blow-up of the fire towers. They are
certainly
not belfreys; and the fire-tower scheme being gone, I have not heard any thing' suggested
having the slightest degree of probability. In Scotland and Ireland they are
evidently
all of the same nature, and for the same purpose. As these towers are
generally known
by the name of fire-towers, I have thought it expedient to continue it.

ROUND TOWER OF DONOUGHMORE.
Donoamosu is a small village near Nsvan, where St. Patrick founded an Abbey named Biletor-
tain, over which he placed St. Justin. It was aher called Domnach-tortain, and now Donough-
more. 'Hue church is at present ruinous, but one end of it is remaining. The round tower, Plate
25,issimilsrtoothers: the door is to the east, and six feet fromtheground: overit are sculp-
tures ofour Saviour on the cross. It is on an eminence, not far from the road leading from Navan
to Slane.
This view, which represents the south-west aspect, was drawn by Lieut. Dan. Grose, An. 1792.

LANYON CROMLEH,
IN THE PARISH or MADERN, CORNWALL.
°~l ,
Tan length of the area described by the supporters of Lanyon Quoit is seven feet; but it does
not stand east and west, as at Molfra, but north and south, as that monument of Haraldus, men-
tioned by Wormius, p. 22. There is no
Kistvaen, that is, no area marked out by side stones
under this Quoit, which is more than forty-seven feet in girt, nineteen feet long: its thickness in
the middle, on the eastern edge, is sixteen inches, at each end not so much, but at the western
edge this Quoit is two feet thick. The two chief supporters A and B, Plate 26, Fig. l and 2,
do not stand at right angles with the front line, as in other Cromlehs, but obliquely, being forced
from their original position, as I imagine, by the weight of this Quoit, which is also so
high that a
nian can sit on horseback under it. Under this Quoit I caused to be sunk a pit of four feet and a
half deep, and found it all black earth that had been moved, and should have sunk still deeper,
but that the gentleman in whose ground it is, told me that a few years before the whole cavity had
been opened (on account of some dream) to the full depth of six feet, and then the fast ground
appeared, and they dug no deeper; that the cavity was in the shape of n grave, and had been rifled
more than once, but that nothing was found more than ordinary. This Cromleh stands on a low
bank of earth, not two feet higher than the adjacent soil, about 20 feet wide, and 70 long, running
north and south. At the south end it has many rough stones, some
pitched on end in no order;
yet not the natural furniture of the surface, but designedly put there, though by the remains, it is
dilicult to say what their original position was. West N. W. there is a high stone about 80 yards'
distance. By the black earth thrown up in digging here, nothing is to be absolutely concluded,
there having happened so
many disturbances. By the pit being in the shape of a
grave, and six
feet deep, it is not improbable that a human body was interred here; and by the length of the
bank, and the many disorderly stones at the south end, this should seem to have been a burial-
place for more than one
person. Boaulsn, Hin. Cornwall, p. 230.
On this kind of monument Dr. Borlase makes the following observations:
ln several parts of Cornwall we find a large dnt stone in a horizontal position (or near it)
supported by other Hat stones placed on their edges, and fastened in the ground, on purpose to bear
the weight of that stone, which rests upon, overshadows them, and, by reason of its extended
surface, and its elevation of six or
eight feet or more from the ground, makes the principal figure
in this kind of monument. The situation which is generally chosen for this monument is the very
a
I LANYON CROMLEH-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
summit of the hill ; and nothing can be more exact than the placing some of them, which shews
that those who erected them were very solicitous to place them as
conspicuously as possible.
Sometimes this dst stone and its supporters stand upon the plain, natural soil and common level
of the ground5 but at other times it is mounted on a barrow, made either ct' stone or earth. It is
sometimes placed in the middle of n circle of stones erect ;* and, when it has a place of that dignity,
must be supposed to have been erected on some extraordinary occasion; hut when acircle has a tall
stone in the middle, it eems to have been unlawful to remove that middle stone, and therefore we ind
this monument of which we are speaking sometimes placed on the head of such a circle. But we
had some Cromlehs erected on such rocky situations, and so distant from houses, (where no stones
erect do stand, or appear to have stood,) that we may conclude they were often erected in places
where there were no such circles.

CELTS.
_
IN the ancient tumuli which have been opened by inquisitive philosophers, numbers
of instruments have been found which they have called Celts. Sometimes they are
made ot' a mixture of copper and tin, at other times of flint. Those of' flint are sup-
posed to have been buried before metals were known, of course before this tin-working
nation dived into the bowels of' the earth. Heads of arrows and of spears are found, also
ot' flint. Along with these are
occasionally found beads and trinkets of glass and amber,
cut into different shapes, in forms which could never be produced by instruments made
of' flint. If these flint instruments were made before the discovery of the metals, they go
back long previous to the time of .Moses or Joi): but if these countries were inhabited
either by a colony from Sidon, or
by a swarm from the great Asiatic hive, they would in
that case have been acquainted with the art ot' metallurgy. The Celts in Plate 27, from
the place for the shaft, are evidently unfit for war, or for instruments for cutting either
wood or stone. If' I wished to swell my work, I could easily fill a volume with the
speculations and reasonings of ingenious men
respecting them. But all the suggestions
are totally void ofthe least probability except one, and that is, that they were used as
amulets or talismans, and, from a motive of superstition, were buried along with their
owners. This seems to me to receive additional strength from a
discovery of some of'
them in the ruins of Herculaneum; for we
may be very certain that the engravers of
gems wanted no stone or brass celts, as workmen's tools.
If' the flint celts and arrow-heads are allowed to have been for warlike purposes,I
think they must be dated before the working of' the tin mines, where plenty of copper
must have been obtained. Rich people, such as those buried under the large tumuli,
would never use flint when they could get brass.
They are now often found in Roman encampments in Britain. Perhaps my reader
may thinkl dismiss these matters too briefly, but I really have nothing new to suggest,
and I see no use in retailing plans of' my predecessors in order to refiite them, when in
fact they want no refuting, but refute themselves. However, a few observations by
Dr. Borlase I shall subjoin.' The Celts in Plate 27 are copied from Borlase's History
of Cornwall. _
My reader will observe that these celts have a kind of ring or
eye at the side of them:
on this Dr. Borlase, p. 287, observes,

The greatest didiculty is, what this Ring or Eye (Fig. I. II. IV. and VI.) should be designed for.
That it should be intended to fasten on the arming to the haft, is an end that it would by no means
answer, as is evident, it being placed below the edge of the socket in No. I. and II., whereas, in or-
der to ihstcn it to the handle, it should be placed above, and then (without another to answer it on
the other side) according to all the rules of mechanicks, its power could secure but half the in-
strument :
*
besides, if we observe the ring in No. II. it is too light and weak to Ex a
bandage,
or wire, for a head of such veight and size. Upon diligent consideration, therefore, the ring
could never be designed for this use. Let us see, in the next place, whether even this part may
not be reconciled to the arts of war.
It is not unlikely that this ring, though it might possibly be of use to fix the labarum, the
garlnnds of victory, or the bunch of ribbons (for all these we find placed at the spear's head,
and therefore the Roman spear must have been properly prepared to receive them), yet served, more
especially among the less cultivated nations, to fix a line to, by means of which the soldier carried
this javelin more commodiously on his march by slingiug it on his shoulder, and might throw it
with more force in time of action, or by means of the fastened line recover it to him again after he
had assailed his adversary. For all these purposes this ring is equally convenient. But, if th e
instruments were designed for war, it may seem strange to some that they should be made of brass,
when they would be so much more proper for all warlike uses if they had been made of iron. In
answer to which I may observe, that in ancient times they had neither such plenty nor choice of
'
d ither with brass nor iron.
metals as we have at present. The most ancient weapons were arms ne
The Sarmations,1~ the Germans,1 and the I-Inns,§ for want of metals, pointed the dart with
bone. The Gauls had heads of ivory, and some of stone for their arrows; they had also what are
called stone hatchets, as appears by what have been found in their sepulchres,1| and the Britons, as
is observed before, had flint heads for their spears and arrows, if they had not hatchets also of the
same substance. 11' This was the most ancient way of making and arming their weapons, in the
western parts; but copper being found in many places, and very early among the Orientals, the
way of tempering, hardening, and colouring it with tin, lead, or lapth calaminanb, soon followed,
and was probably as ancient as the invention of swords, which, by learned men, is supposed coeval
with war; with this metal it was soon found much easier to head their spears and arrows, than to
grind a stone into the necessary ofensive form; wherever, therefore, they had a sumcient quantity
of brass, they threw aside the more operose preparation of stone heads for these warlike weapons,
and armed them with brass. But iron was not found out till 188 years before the war of Troy, if
we
may believe the Arundeliau Marbles, and this may be the reason that brass weapons are so
allen mentioned in Homer, the ancients working in brass much more early than in iron, according
to Hesiod."
And Lucretius, Lib. v.,

And when iron became known, and its superior hardness acknowledged, it was scarce. The
°
Dr. Ricb|rdson's conjecture, therefore, (Leland, Vol. I. p. l42,) though ingenious, and his bandage neatly designed,
cannot be true.

Sarmatinns (a very extensive nation) had no iron in all their country! The Germans had none
iu'l`acitus's time; and in Britain iron was very scarce, as Caesar says,1' and found only near the
sea-coast, and that in so small a
quantity, and so
precious, that their money was sometimes made
of that metal. Thus it appears, that the use of iron came later into the western part of Europe;
so that it is no wonder that anciently their weapons were made of brass. Even among the Romans,
their arms were of brass:
ll
asratam qnnticns Turpeia securim. .Era xi. 656.
flirataequc micant peltus, inicut srrcus ensis. Ib. vii. 743.
'I'heir arrows also were tipped with brass, as appears by so
great a number of them found at one
time, as loaded several boats.I
The spears of the Lusitanians, says Strabo, were pointed with brass; and, to come nearer home,
the Cinibrians and Gauls had brass for their weapons;§ the Danes made their short swords, arrow-
points, spurs, and knives, of brass ;|| and lastly the Britons had the same metal, and for the same use,
as appears by part of a sword found in Mén in Sennnn, by the brass found in Trelowarren Barrow,
by those published by Dr. Plot, (Stnlf. p. 396,) and by the spear-heads, axes for war, and swords
of copper, wrapt up in linen before mentioned, found at St. Michae1's Mount in this county, as well as
by the several places in Britain before mentioned which have yielded a fruitful harvest of such-like
weapons.
Besides the scarceness of iron, there is another reason which the ancients had for making their
weapons of brass, which is, that iron is not so
easily worked up, cast, repaired (I mean recast)
and polished; nor indeed, after all, of so rich or lasting a colour as brass. Montfaucon, therefore,
rightly observes, (though he assigns not the reason,) that after the use of iron was found out, the
ancients continued the use of brass in making their weapons, and other things, for which at pre-
sent we use only iron. In short, all the fragments of brass were serviceable, and easily to be
remelted, and cast anew. And that the Britons put in practice this piece of good husbandry, is
plain, from what was discovered at Fitiield; '° a great quantity of these instruments, some entire,
some broke, with fragments of the same metal, but to what particular utensils they belonged,
uncertain. These, with the quantity of unwrought metal found with them, are undonbted evidences
of a furnace being here for casting such implements of war, and that here lived and worked an
artist, whose profession was that of a founder or caster of brass; and I cannot but observe, that
spear-heads being found amongst the rest of these materials must make us conclude that the work-
man who made the heads of spears pointed, made the edged ones too called celts, javelins of all
kinds, and arrows-their use, intent, and substance being so much alike, that he who made the
one, could not be ignorant oi, or unpractised in making the other. This is therefore an
equal proof
of the Britons using brass weapons, and of the instruments found there being weapons of war.
There is another circumstance worth notice, in what has been mentioned before, which is, that some
celts, found in a stone-quarry in Yorkshire, had cases exactly itted to them. Why inclosed in
Cases? Why, doubtless, for the same reason as those found at St. Michael's Mount were wi-apt
up in linen, to preserve the keenness of the edge; and I must own it seems to me, that chisels for
working stone needed not to have been so cautiously sheathed; but rather, that the intention of
the owner was, that by this means the edges of so tender a metal might be better kept for execu-
tion against the day of battle.

HURLER&
~
IN the Parish of St. Clare, in Cornwall, are three circles of stones calledt he
Hurlers, ot' which Dr. Borluse (Plate 28, page 198) has given the following descrip-
tion. To his theories the reader will give what credit he thinks proper.
Some circles are near one the other, and their centres in a line, to signify, perhaps, that they
were intended for, and directed to, one use. Of this kind is the monument called the Hurlers, in
the Parish of St. Clare, Cornwall ; the stones of which, bythe vulgar, are supposed to have been once
Men, and thus transformed, as a punishment for their hurling," upon the Lord's~day. This
monument consisted of three circles, from which many stones are now carried 08; what remain,
and their distances, may be seen in Plate 28. Again, some of these circles include and in-
tersect oue the other, as in the curious cluster of circles nt Botallek (Plate 29), in the seeming
confusion of which,I cannot but think, that there was some
mystical meaning, or at least distinct
allotment to particular uses. Some of these might be employed for the sacrilice, and to prepare,
kill, examine, and burn the victim; others allotted to prayer, others to the feasting of the priests,
others for the station of those who devoted the victims: whilst one Druid was
preparing the victim
'in one place, another was
adoring in another, and describing the limits of his temple: a third was
going his roimd at the extremity of another circle of stones; and, likely, many Drmds were to
follow one the other in these mysterious rounds; others were busy in the rites of augury, that so
all the rites, each in its proper place, might proceed at one and the same time, and under the
inspection of the high-priests; who, by comparing and observing the indications of the whole,
might judge of the will of the Gods with the greater certainty; lastly, that these circles intersected
each other in so remarkable a manner, as we iind them in this monument, might be to intimate,
that each of these holy rites, though exercised in dilferent circles, and their own
proper compart-
ments, were but so
many rings, or links, of one and the same chain ; and that there was a con-
stant dependence and connexion betwixt sacriice, prayer, holy feasting, and all the several
parts of their worship. It is farther to be noted, that near most of these Circular monuments
we find detached stones, as particularly on the south-west side of these circles, at A and B,
which are
placed so
orderly, that there can he no doubt of their having had some share allotted
them of the superstitious rites. At these stones, probably, the high-priest had his omcers to keep
silence, and the omciating priests their assistants to prompt them, lest any material words might
be left out, or what were
disorderly inserted; for the ancients were
scrupulously nice in every thing
said or done, upon such solemn occasions, and were not only allowed their prompter,1' but aseoond

person also at hand to mark that no
ceremony or circumstance should be omitted. Let me hrther
observe, that these detached stones are found at too great a distance for the before-mentioned
Purposes; inferior priests might be stationed to prevent or
regulate any disorderly behaviour on the
outskirts of the congregation, and might attentively observe the dying of birds, or
my other
ominou appearances, during the time of these solemnitiea. I have only izrther to
remark, that
the circles F. H. I. in this singular monument of Botallek, appear to have been hedged with two
mws of stones. It need not be here added, that in whatsoever circles we find ashes and alters,
they want no arguments to prove that they were places of sacridce and worship!

CLASSERNISS, ISLE OF LEWVIS, SCOTLAND.
__
THE accounts of this temple vary considerably; and as it is in some
respects of
a
singular nature I shall give three different accounts. The following is that of
Dr. Bontass.
ctnssznxrss.
Tun temple at Classerniss is the most regular temple of this kind that I have met with ;
and therefore I have inserted the plan of it in this work* It is in the Isle of Lewis, near
Classerniss, and called a heathen temple.1° It consists of an avenue which has nineteen
stones on each side, from F to E, and one at F; this leads you to a circle of twelve stones,
with one in the centre A: from the circumference of which circle, and in a line with the centre,
run a line of four stones to B, four to D, and four to C. "I inquired (says Mr. Martin) of the
inhabitants what tradition they had eoneeming these stones; and they told me, it was a place
appointed for worship in the time of heathenism: and that the chief Druid stood near the big stone
in the centre, from whence he addressed himself to the people that surrounded him."1~ One obser-
vation occurs to me
relating to this curious monument which is, that the number of stones in the
avenue is 39, and the circle 13, in all 52, and the detached stones to the soutlveast and west,
twelve: whether these numbers happened to he so complete by accident, or whether (as I rather
imagine) they were intended to express the number of weeks and months in one whole year, I
submit to the learned.
The following is the account of Mr. Touixn.
IN the Isle of Lewis, at the village of Classerniss, there is one of these temples very remarkable.
The circle consists of 12 obelisks, about 7 feet high each, and distant from each other 6 feet. In
the centre stands a stone I3 feet high, in the perfect shape of the rudder of aship. Directly south
from the circle, there stand four obelisks running out in a line; as another such line due east, and
a third to the west, the number and distances of the stones being in these wings the same: so
that this temple, the most entire that can be, is at the same time both round and winged. But to
the north there reach (hy way of avenue) two straight ranges of ohelisks, of the same bigness and

likely taken on the spot, and therefore true, and not the copper-plate (il|id.), which does not at all agree (in number of
stones, or lsrgfeness of the circle) with the verbal description; being committed, as I suppose, to the hand1 of some
inaccurate engraver.

distances with those of the circle; yet the ranges themselves are 8 feet distant, and each con-
sisting of I9 stones, the 39th being in the entrance of the avenue.-Tor.. Hitt. Druids, p. 136.
The following is the account of Dr. INIACCULLOCH.
Tris form of the great temple at Loch Bemera, in the Isle of Lewis, the chief isle of the Hebrides,
is that of a cross, containing, at the intersection, a circle with a central stone; an additional line
being superadded on one side of the longest arms and nearly parallel to it. W'ere this line absent,
its form and proportion would be nearly that of the Roman cross or common crucifix. The longest
line of this cross, which may be considered as the general bearing of the work, lies in a direction
24° west of the meridian. The total length of this line is at present 588 feet, but there are stones
to be found in the same direction for upwards of 90 feet further, which have apparently been a con-
tinuation of it, but which having fallen, like others through different parts of the building, have some-
times been overwhelmed with vegetation, leaving blanks that impair its present continuity. The whole
length may, therefore, with little hesitation, be taken at 700 feet. The cross line, intersecting that
now described at right angles, measures 204 feet; but as it is longer on one side than the other, its
true measure is probably also greater, although I was not able to discover any fallen stones at the
extremities-the progress of cultivation having here interfered with the integrity of the work. The
diameter of the circle which occupies the centre of the cross is sixty-three feet, the lines ceasing
where they meet the circumference. The stone which marks the centre is twelve feet in height.
The heights of the other stones which are used in the construction are various, but they rarely
reach beyond four feet; a few of seven or
eight feet are to be found, and one reaching to thirteen is
seen near the extremity of the long line. The additional line already mentioned, extends north'
wards from the outer part of the circle on the eastern side. It is, however, very defective, a
great
number of the stones being absent towards its northern extremity: although there is apparent
evidence of their former continuity, in one which remains erect and in others which have fallen from
their places. There do not appear to be any traces of a line parallel to this on the western side;
but as some inclosures have been made in the immediate vicinity, it is probable that such might
have originally existed; notwithstanding the superstitious reverence with which the Scots in general
regard these remains, and the care with which, in their agricultural operations, they commonly avoid
committing any injury to them. The intervals betwixt the stones vary from two to ten feet or
more, but it is probable that the larger spaces have resulted from the falling of the less firmly-rooted
pillars which occupied those places. The number of stones in the circle is thirteen, independently
of the central one: and the number in the whole building, either erect or
recently fallen, is forty
seven.
The aspect of this work is very striking, as it occupies the highest situation on a
gentle swelling
eminence of moor-land-there being no object, not even a rock or stone, to divert the attention and
diminish the impression which it makes.
The neighbourhood of Loch Bemera contains many nearly similar circles of a less size, all com-
prised in a tract comparatively small, since a
square mile would probably include the whole. They
are situated in an open and fertile tract, on the borders of this intricate inlet of the sea. The circles
found in the vicinity are less perfect, and present no linear appendages : their avemge diameter varies
from forty to titty feet, and one of them contains four nprights, placed in a
quadrangular form, within
its area. Solitary stones, apparently of a monumental nature, are found in its neighbourhood, as

well as in the Island of Bemera and in other parts of Lewis.-The above is the substance of Dr.
Macculloch's description. He adds, "'I'he whole is too consistent, and too much of one age, to
admit of such a supposition; (ie. that it has been madainto tlmform ey'a cron by the Catholics tosuit
it to their worship) while, at the same time, it could not, under any circumstances, have been ap-
plicable to a Christian worship. Its essential part, the circular area, and the number of similar
structures found in the vicinity, equally bespeak its ancient origin. It must therefore he concluded,
that the cruciform shape was given by the original contrivers of the fabric; and it will aEord an
object of speculation to antiquaries, who, if they are sometimes accused of heaping additional ob-
scurity on the records of antiquity, must also be allowed the frequent merit of eliciting light from
darkness. To them I willingly consign all further speculations concerning it." Macconmcn,
Western Islands, Vol. L pp. l84, &c., Svo.
The difference in the above three accounts, I think it may not be impossible to re-
concile, when the difliculty of making out the plans amongst standing-com, or the
intricacy caused by fences intersecting them, &c., are considered. Dr. Macculloch
admits, that it was a work previous to the existence of Christianity, and that is enough
for the argument of the author of this work. And its being in the form of a cross, one
of the stones being broken, and partly buried by time and agriculture, and lying not ihr
from the side of its remaining hall; may readily account for the thirteenth stone, without
supposing that either Martin or Toland has been guilty of a wilful lie, as Dr. Maccul-
loch seems to insinuate in another part of his work. By the mode of drawing adopted
in the long line ofthe cross, by Dr. Macculloch, in giving the ground-plan of some stones
and the elevation of others, the openings are concealed, but it is pretty nearly plain that
there have been nineteen, and no more and no less. Whether the two lines are awry, as
represented in the plan, or not, is of little consequence; if they be, it would appear that
the architect has been as inattentive as the architect of the cathedral at York, who placed
the choir in a similar manner on one side of the grand aisle. Much allowance must be
made in the estimate of these temples for the necessary uncertainty arising fiom the
confused condition to which their intentional destroyers have reduced them; for though
they are venerated by the natives, we know that they were objects of deadly hate to such
pwple as formed Cromwell's armies, and destroyed the monasteries of Melrose, the Maen
Ambre, in Cornwall, 8rc.

CONSTANTINE TOLMEN.
THE ancients in various parts of the world had a
superstitious practice of passing
through holes under stones or openings made between them, by which they fancied they
became regenerated or absolved ti-om their sins. There are several of these in Cornwall.
Dr. Borlase informs us, that, in that county, they are called Tolmen. The following is
his description of one in the parish of Constantine:
But the most utonishing monument of this kind, is in the Tenement of Men, in the parish of
Constantine, Cornwall. (Plate 30.) It is one vast
egg-like stone, placed on the points of two
natural rocks, so that a man
may creep under the great one, and between its supporters, through
a
passage about 3 feet wide, and as much high. The longest diameter of this stone is 33 feet from
C to D, pointing due north and south : from A to B it is 14 feet, 6 deep; and the breadth in the
middle of the surface, where widest, was 18 feet, 6 wide, from east to west. I measured one half
of the circumference, and found it, according to my computation, 48 feet and a halt, so that this
stone is 97 feet in circumference, about 60 feet across the middle, and, by the best information I
eau get, contains at least 750 tons of stone. Getting up by aladder to view the top of it, we found
the whole surface worked, like an
imperfect or mutilated honey-comb, into basons; one much
larger than the rest was at the south end, about seven feet long; another at the north, about Eve;
the rest smaller, seldom more than one foot, oftentimes not so much; the sides and shape irre-
gular. Most of these basons discharge into the two principal ones (which lie in the middle of the
surface), those only excepted which are near the brim of the stone, and they have little lips or
channels, (marked in Plate 30, l, 2, 3, 4, 5,) which discharge the water they collect over the sides of
the Tolmen; and the dat rocks which lie underneath receive the droppings in basons cut into their
surfaces. This stone is no less wonderful for its position than for its size; for although the under
part is nearly semicircnlar, yet it rests on the two large rocks E, F; and so light and detached does
it stand, that it touches the two under stones, but as it were on their points, and all the sky appears
at GJ* The two Tolmens at Scilly are monuments evidently of the same kind with this, and of
the same name; and these, with all of like structure, may with great probability, I think, though of
such stupendous weight, be asserted to be the work of art, the under stones in some instances
appearing to have been fitted to receive and support the upper one. It is also plain, from their
works at Stonehenge, and some of their other monuments, that the Druids had skill enough in the
°
In Ireland there are monuments of the same kind. One mentioned in the History of the County of Waterford, p.
70, is called St. Declan'a Stone.
"
It lies shelving upon the point of a rock, and on the patron-dey of this Saint, gr-at
numbers creep under this stone three times, in order, as they pretend, to cure and prevent pains in the back. This
stone, they tell you, swam miraculously from Rome, conveying upon it St. Declsn's bell and vestments."

thought every thing that was sacred, would be profaned by touching the ground ;1 and therefore,

as imagine, or ,
by touching the common earth. Another thing is worthy our notice in this kind of monuments,
which is that, underneath these vast stones, there is a hole or passage between the rocks.§ What

use the ancients made of these passages, we can only guess ; but we have reason to think, that when

Eres, a lustration which ever afterwards made the Gentiles think that those who had gone through,
had acquired thereby a
greater degree of purity than any others; and, as Maimonides informs us,°
the Canaanites believed that such children should not die before their time.-Bonnass, pp. 174, 8tc.
Dr. Borlase and other gentlemen have written a
great deal respecting Rock Basons.
These are hollows or basons, which have every appearance of being made by art, on the
tops of the Logan-stones, Cromlehs, and other Druidical monuments, to receive the
rain-water as it fell. Modern geologists have undertaken to shew that they are natural;
but in this I think they completely fail. This water was
probably used for lustrations
or baptisms.
From the works of Tertullian, Justin Martyr, &c., it appears very evident that the
practice of baptism was adopted by the followers of MITHRA, long before the time of
CHnrsr. These authors ascribe it to the prescience and malice ofthe Devil.
It is very certain that the Etruscans, many centuries before the time of Christ, used
this rite, both for inihnts and adults, as
may be seen in the plates of Etruscan monuments
published by Gorius. Now, though we have no records, or vases covered with paint-
ings, like those of the Etruscan, to shew us that our Druids used this ceremony, the
numerous rock basons look very suspicious ; particularly as we know from the cxxii. Ep.
of Pope Gregory, to Boniface, the Apostle of the Germans, that it was in use
by them
previous to Christianity. In that letter he orders them to be rebaptized in the name of
the Holy Trinity, if they had only undergone the Pagan baptism.1' I think it is un-
necessary to copy Borlase's plates of mere holes on the tops of stones.

LOGAN STONE, CORNWALL.
THE following account of this stone is from Dr. Borlase's History, page 180.
In the parish of St. Levin, Cornwall, there is a
promontory, called Castle Treryn. This cape
consists of three distinct groups of rocks. On the western side of the middle group, near the
top, lies a
very large stone, so evenly poised, that any hand may move it to or fro ; but the ex-
tremities of its base are at such a distance from each other, and so well secured by their nesrness
to the stone which it stretches itself upon, that it is morally impossible that any lever, or indeed
any force, (however applied in a mechanical way,) can remove it from its present situation. It is
called the Logan Stone, and at such a height from the ground, that no one who sees it can conceive
that it has been lifted into the place we see it in. Vide Plate 31.
The Doctor was completely mistaken in his idea that this stone could not be thrown
down, as the following account proves :
"The public attention has, for the last six months, been much attracted to the celebrated Logan
Stone, in Cornwall; not so much on account of its presenting a great natural curiosity, but from
the circumstance that, in April last, an omcer of the British Navy on the Preventive Service, with
his men, threw it down from its time-honoured seat, and the same gentleman having, within the
last few days, replaced it in its former situation-a task of no ordinary dimculty.
"The Logan Stone is situated at Castle Treryn, about two miles distant from Land's End. The
name of Castle Treryn is derived from the supposition of its having been the site Qf an 3I!¢l¢Ut
British fortress, of which there are still some obscure traces, although the wild and rugged ap-
pearance of the rocks indicates nothing like art.
"
The foundation ot' the whole is s
stupendous group of granite rocks, which rise in pyramidical
clusters to a
prodigious altitude, and overhang the sea. On one of those pyramids is situated the
celebrated Logan Stone, which is an immense block of granite, weighing above 60 tons. The
surface in contact with the under rock is of very small extent, and the whole mass is so nicely
balanced, that, notwithstanding its magnitude, the strength of a single man
applied to its under
edge, is suicient to change its centre of gravity; and though at Brat in a degree scarcely per-
ceptible, yet the repetition of such impulses, at each return of the stone, produces at length a very
sensible oscillationl As soon as the astonishment which this phenomenon excites has in some
measure subsided, the stranger anxiously inquires how and whence the stone originated P-was it
elevated hy human means, or was it produced by the agency of natural causes?
"
Although the Druidical origin of this stone, for which so many zealous antiquaries have con-
tended, may hxirly he denied, still we by no means intend to deny that the Druids employed it as
an engine of superstition. It is indeed very probable that, having observed so uncommon a
pro-
perty, they dexteronsly contrived to make it answer the purposes of an ordeal, and by regarding
it as the touchstone of truth, acquitted or condemned the accused by its motions.
"
The rocks are covered with a species of byssus, long and rough to the touch, forming a kind of

hoary heard. In many places they are deeply furrowed, carrying with them a
singular air of
antiquity, which combines with the whole of the romantic scenery, to awaken in the minds of the
poet and enthusiast the recollection of the Druidical ages.
"The following extract ofa letter contains au account of the restoration of this celebrated relic
of antiquity:
"
'Penzance, Nov. 6.
"
'The Logan rock is replaced, and rocks as before. It was put up on
Tuesday last, alter three
days' labour, by the help of three pair of large shears, six capstans, worked by eight men each,
and a variety of pulleys. Large chain cables were fastened round the rock, and attached to the
blocks by which it was lifted. Altogether there were about sixty men
employed. The weight of
the rock has been variously computed by diiferent persona, at li-om 70 to 90 tons. On the 'first
day, when the rock was hrst swung in the air, in the presence of about two thousand persons,
much anxiety was felt by those who were present, as to the success of the undertaking: the ropes
were much stretched; the pulleys, the sheers, and the capstans, all screeched and groaned; and
the noise of the machinery was audible at some distance. Many were
apprehensive lest so vast a
weight might snap all the ropes, and tumble over the precipice, bearing the sheers and scafolding
away with it; however, the whole has gone 0E with great success. The materials (which were
all furnished gratis, from the dock-yard at Plymouth) were excellent, and ingeniouely managed;
and though a
rope or two broke, and a link of one of the chains tore away a small piece of an angle
of the rock, which was thrown with much velocity into the sea, yet the rock was
safely supported
by its complicated tackling, and stands, once more, in precisely its former position! The Lieu-
tenant who threw it down, was the engineer in replacing it; and, in the opinion of many of the
gentlemen of this town and neighbourhood, he has, by his skill and personal labour and attention,
entirely wiped away the disgrace to which he was exposed by throwing it down. It is understood
that the expenses of this work are defrayed by subscription. Fifty pounds have been given by the
Loudon Geological Society!

WVRINGCHEESE.
THE famous rock, called the Wringc/zeese, described in Plate 82, has lately been
supposed by geologists to be a natural production. This is probably the case in part;
h D ids takin advantage of favourable circumstances to convert these rocks into
r e ru g
idols, or objects of adoration. The following is Dr. Borlase's account of it, p. 173:
The rock now called Wringcheesef' is a group of rocks that attracts the admiration of all
travellers. It is best apprehended by its Icon. (Plate 32.) On the top stone B were two re-
b rt f one of them has been broken od; as may be seen at A. The upper stone B,
gular asons; pa o
was as I have been informed, a Logan, or rocking-stone, and might, when it was entire, be easily
o;ed with apole but now great part of that weight which kept it on a poise is taken sway. The
m 1
whole heap of stone is 32 feet high: the great weight of the upper part, from A to B, and the
h ill ded ile
slenderness of the under part from B to C, make every one wonder how suc an -groun p
could resist, for so many ages, the storms of such an exposed situation. It may seem to some that
it is an artificial building of dat stones, layed carefully on one another, and raised to this height by
human skill and labour; but as there are several heaps of stones ou the same hill, and also on a
hill about a mile distant, called Kell-mar'r, of like fabric too, though not near so high as this, I
should think it a. natural cragg, and that what stones surrounded it, and hid its grandeur, were
b
`
k-
removed by the Druids. From its having rock-basons, from the uppermost stone emg a mc
in -stone from the well-poised structure, and the great elevation of this group, I think we may
S »
truly reckon it among the rock deities; and that its tallness and just balance might probably be
.
. .
.
th k_
intended to express the statehness and Justice of the Supreme Being. Secondly, as e roc
basons shew that it was usual to get upon the top of this karn, it might probably serve for the
Druids to harsngue the audience, pronounce decisions, and foretell future events.

COINS OF THE BRITONS.
.i_._i__
I AM of opinion that the ancient Celtae of Britain had no coins of silver or
gold.
After the time of Caesar, I think it probable that they adopted them, and that those in
the annexed plate may be some of them. They are so doubtfiil, that I consider them of
very little value; but I thought an inquisitive reader might wish to see them, therefore
I have given a few of what are
engraved in Borlase. The coins of the ancient Britons
I have no doubt were of iron, their precious metal, and those in Plate 27 are specimens
of them, as given by Borlase, pp. 259, 274-.
As soon as the Gauls, or any other harbarous nations, saw the great use of money, as it was
managed among the more polished parts of mankind, it is natural to imagine that people of autho-
rity would endeavour to introduce the same convenient way of exchange among their own
people;
but, being hasty and impetuous to have the thing done, were not over nice in their choice of
artists for the doing it. What iirst and principally struck them was the use of money; to have
the money coined with beauty and expression, was what had no
place in their first conceptions,
nor entered at allinto their designs. H oe came the first coins so rude and inexpressive; because
the art, though at full maturity among the Greeks and Romans, was forced to pass through a,
second infancy among the Gauls ; and, like the gold that was cast into the ire, could not come out
a better molten calf than the hands which were employed were able to mould and fashion it. The
money, therefore, coined at drst among the Ganls and Britons, could not but partake of the bar-
barity and ignorance of the times in which it 'rirst came into use ; and the Hgures must have been
much ruder and more uncouth than those of the inscribed coins. Of this kind of money are pro-
bably laminm ferrem, of which Caesar peaks, Comment. qf the Gall, Wqr, Lib, v,, and gf whidl
Mr. Edward Lhwyd, in his Travels through Cornwall, writes in the following manner, sending at
the same time the outlines of the pieces he found to Thos. Tonkin, Esq., by letter dated at Falmouth,
Nov. 29, 1700. "
The ifth and sixth ig-urea" (Plate 27, Fig. 1 and 2)
"
are two iron plates of
that form and size, whereof several horse-loads were found about six years since. Qu. Whether
these may not he the British- money mentioned by Caesar in these words,-Nwnmo utunturpwvo
et ereo autferreir laminis' pro nummo." On which Mr. Tonkin, (M. S. B., p. l93,) remarks, "I
am
apt to believe that Mr. Lhwyd rightly concludes that this was the British money mentioned by
°
In other editions called "'lhleis fcrreis adccrtum pondus examina|:is;"anf| the late leunedbr. Moyls observed,
that "
Dr. Dawis, in hh notes (viz. on the Commcntarie), with Lipsius, judges Amelia fern-is to be the true rend-
i-ng; andDr.Clnrke, inhisedition of Casar,hssadmitteditintothetcxt,npon thomthorityofthesemauuscriptlnd

Caesar;" and then adds, "This present year, 1730, as they were
pulling down the great tower
and some very old buildings at Boconnoclr, the seat of the late Lord Mohun, in Cornwall, about a
peck of the same sort, but of a
larger size, (Plate 27, Fig. 3 and 4,) were found in part of an old
wall there." Those coins, then, which are not inscribed, are most probably older than those of
the same nation which are inscribed ; inscriptions or legends being a part of elegance and accuracy
which at first were not at all attended to, but which altenages constantly practised, consulting at
once the conveniency of their commerce, and the glory of their country.
If this inference is right, our coins at Karnbre, and the like sort in Plot, and Camden's English
edition, are older than the inscribed ones produced by Camden and Speed, and consequently older
than the Roman invasion.-Bonr.Asn's Cornwall.
I am of opinion that in all countries or@naI(y, gold was the common metal for
useihl domestic purposes. It would be found in the beds of rivers and obtained with-
out difiiculty. Probably after some time the accidental burning of a forest on a moun-
tain, as the ancients allege, by melting the ore, might teach mankind the mode of
obtaining it. Probably for some time iron, from its great superiority of real value,
would he the precious metal. It would be also much more didicult to obtain than gold,
silver, and copper.
Seventeen I here exhibit, (in Plate 33,) of dmerent impressions, size or weights: several others,
found at the same time and place, I have seen; but being of the same sort as these examples, I
think it needless to lay them before the public. I range the rudest, and those which have figures
most unknown, irst, (as others engaged in treating of medals have done,) beingin all probability
the most ancient; the others follow according as their criterions seem to become more and more
perfect and modern. I mention their weight also, as a material circumstance (though omitted by
other authors) for classing them, and discovering what are and what are not the same sort of coin.
The size in the Plate is the real one
by measurement of the coins. The Bret has some igures upon
it which I do not understand: its weight is 22 grains.
No. 2 has some figures on one side, which I do not so much as guess at. On the other side it
has the limb or trunk of a tree, with little branches springing from it on one part, and what I take
also for the body of a tree, with two round holes or marks, where the limbs have been lopped oil,
and roots at the bottom on the other part: it weighs only 23 grains.
No. 3 has a ligure, which in the coin attributed to Cassihelan (by Speed, p. 30) is more
plain, and resembles two dolphins, turning their crooked backs to each other. On the other side
it has a
plain large stump of a tree, with two branches breaking out on each side. It rises out of the
ground, and stands between two smaller trees: it weighs 23 grains.
No. 4 is quite defaced on one side, unless it be die outline of a human head ; but on the other
it has some parts of a. horse, and some little round studs, or button~like emboesments, both which
marks will be particularly discoursed of when we come to explain the several uncommon
tigures
which these coins aford us: it weighs 26 grains.
No. 5 has one side eiaced ; the reverse is a horse, betwixt the legs of which there is a wheel,
and from its back rises the stem of a spear or
javelin: weight, 26 grains.
No. 6 has the stem of a tree, with its collateral branches very distinct. In the middle it is
crossed slope-wise by a bar, like the shait of a
spear: the reverse has the horse, the wheel, and
COINS OF THE Bl1IT0NS1DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. Ixvii
spear, but somewhat differently placed on the gold. The weight is twenty-live grains and a half ;
by which I conclude, that the side which is defaced in No. 5, was the same as in this coin; for the
reverses are the same, and their weight corresponds to half a
grain, which may be allowed for the
greater use that has been made of this than of the former.
No. 7 has on one side some appearance of' a human head (which side of the coin we shall
henceforth call the head, as medalists generally do, to avoid a
multiplicity of words) : on the re-
verse the remains are so mutilated, that it can be only said that this reverse was much omamented,
but what the ornaments were, is not to be discovered: it weighs 23 grains.
No. 8 has the lines of a
garland, or diadem, on the head. The reverse has the exergue at
bottom, supported by jagged lines interspersed with dots, above which are some harharous dgures,
which are to be explained, and their orderly disposition here and in some of the other coins
accounted for, in their proper place: it weighs four penny-weights, three grains.
No. 9 has a bead much defaced, but visible, as is also the outline of the neck and the ear.
Behind the forehead and nose it has three semicircular protuherances: the reverse has the same
figure as the reverse of No. 8, but has more little round stubs on it, (the die which gave the
impression being placed farther hack in this than in the former,) and discovers therefore a circular
figure -No. 7, with the three pointed javelins, No. 6 underneath it, which the other impres-
I
sion has not; but by the run of the die, the former has one of the figures which is not in this.
d th char ed with like
It weighs four penny-weights, three grains, which weight, au e reverse, g
dgures, (though differently placed,) shews, that these two coins were struck at one time by the
same die, and are of the same value.
No. 10 has a laureated diadem, across which, at right angles, is a fillet, or rather clasp, and a
faint appearance of a hook at the end of it; the rest defaced. The reverse has a distinct exergue
at bottom; the same figures partly as No. 8 and 9, but the die was placed still further back
on the gold, therefore not altogether the same; the javelins or spears (or whatever those pointed
stakes signify) being in this coin cut od' by a descending line,intimating that but part only of those
instruments were to be exhibited. It weighs four penny-weights, two grains, by which it is pro-
bable that it is the same sort of coin with the two foregoing, allowing one grain out of the My
for the wear.
No. ll has the laureated diadem and clasp, above which the hair turns od' in bold curls. 'l`he
reverse has the same charge as the three foregoing, but better placed; and it should be a coin of
the same sort, but that it weighs four penny-weights, and seven
grains; so that it must have
been much less used than the others, if of the same time and value.
No. 12 has on the head several parallel lines, fashioned into squares, looking like the plan of
a town, of which the streets cross nearly at right angles, and the whole cut by one straight and
wider street than the rest. On the reverse are the remains of a horse, with a. collar or garland round
his neck, and behind something like a charioteer driving forward. Underneath the horse is a wheel,
and a few studs scattered near the extremities of the coin: it weighs one
penny-weight, three grains.
No. 13 just shews the faint profile of a human face; the reverse, a horse, a
spear hanging
forward towards the horse's neck; some appearance of a charioteer above the horse: it weighs
only 23 grains.
No. 14 has a laureated diadem round the temples, above which the hair turns hack in large
curls. The diadem has the clasp or ribbon, which has a hook at the bottom of it, and on the

shoulder is ajibula or button, which tucked up the loose garment. The reverse has a horse, with
a wheel below it, and many small and large stnds above it : it weighed 25 grains.
No. I5 exhibits a distinct human face in proile. 'l'he head is lanreated, clasped, and cirrated
as the others, which plainly shews that where there is only a simple laureated diadem now to he
th h fac also was though now worn ont. The reverse
seen, as inNo. 10, ll, 14, there e uman e ,
has a horse, with a wheel below it, and crescents, studs, and halls shove it: weight, 26 grains.
No. 16 is the best-preserved coin, as well as largest and most distinct, which I have seen oi
the gold coins found in Comwall. The proile is well-proportioned, and destitute of neither spirit
nor expression; and it is somewhat surprising that an artist, who could design the human face so
well, should draw the horse so very indiferently on the other side. This head has two rows of
curls above the lsureated diadem, and the folds of the garment rise up round the neck close to the
ear. The reverse,ahorse, a wheel, balls, and crescents, as in the rest: it weighs four penny-
weights, l4.geains.
No. 17 is the same weight as No. 13, and the horse is nearly of the same turn, but here it
has a crest of heads or pearl for a mane, as No. 14. It has also some appearance of reins (as of
n bridle) under the jaw. The horse is better turned than in any of them. Behind the wheel it
has something depending like a
pole, which reaches the ground; whether a reclining spear, or
what their scythes might be fastened to, or any other part of the chariot, is uncertain 5 but the
charioteer is plain.

THE IODHAN MORAN ;
THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT.
.l.ii.-___.l.
Auuo Domini 4, Fearadac Fionfactnac, son of Criomthan Niadnor, son of Lugh Réabhdenrg, of
the line of Eireamon, was King of Ireland, and reigned 20 years. His mother, Taothchaoch, was
the daughter of Loich, son of Darius, a Cruthenian. He was named Fearadac Fachtnsc, because
of his justice and equity during his government. In his time lived Moran (son of Muon), the
upright judge, who had the Iodhan Moran. This ornament was worn on the breast; and if any
ve false sentence the Iodhan Moran would close round the neck, till he had given the
one ga ,
proper verdict; and it would do the same if put on the breast of a witness, if he was
delivering
false evidence. Hence it became a proverb to threaten the witness with the Iodban Moran, in
ho es of forcing the truth from him.
P
And in another place Keating says,
"
The famous Moran (Mac Maoin) was one of the chief
judges of this kingdom. When he sat upon the bench to administer justice, he put the miraculous
Iodhan Moran about his neck, which had that wonderful power, that if the judge pronounced an
unjust decree, the breast-plate would instantly contract itself, and encompass the neck so close,
d
that it would be impossible to breathe; but if he delivered s just sentende, it would open itself, an
hang loose upon his shoulders.
Where the monk found the name of this king, or of his judge, does not appear. O'Flaherty
makes no mention of them: however, we are obliged to Keating for the preservation of the name
of this curious breast-plate; the story is evidently made out ofthe following Irish words:
Iodh, Iodhsn, a chain, collar, gorget, breast-plate.
Iodhan, sincere, pure, undedled.
Iodhand, pangs, torments.
Iodhadh, a
shutting, closing, joining.
It is evident that the Iodhan Moran was the breast-plate of judgment. That I now
present to
readers is of ld, rather larger than the size of the drawing. It was found twelve feet deep
mY 8°
in a turf bog, in the county of Limerick, on the estate of Mr. Bury, and is now in the possession
of Mrs. Bury, of Granby Row, Dublin.
It is made of thin plated gold and chased in avery neat and workman-like manner. The breast-
plate is single ; but the hemisphericsl ornaments at the top are lined throughout with another than
plate of pure gold. These are less exposed to injury when on the breast than the lower part.
There must have been a
particular reason for lining these circular concave pieces, which I think
will appear hereaiier. About the centre of each is a small hole in the lining, to receive the
of a chain that suspended it round the neck; and in the centres m front are two small coax
In THE IODHAN MORAN-DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.
pillars of solid gold, highly polished. The chain was found and secreted by the peasant from Mr.
Bury. In cutting the turf, the slane or
spade struck the middle of the omameut, and bruised it,
as represented in the drawing: every other part is perfect. The whole weighs twenty-two guineas.
Another was found some years ago in the County of Longford, and sold for twenty~six guinens.
The breast-plate of the high-priest of the Jews was named mn hm, chosen, Exod 4; and
in Exod. xrviii. 15, DBIDD [wrt /:sn mspt, chosen meshephot, that is, the breast-plate of judgment.
The Greeks name it Myer. i. e. rationale, quia ad pectus, rationis quasi sedem, fuit appositum.
It is very particularly described in Exodus xxviii. 15, 8tc. :
"
Thou shalt make the breast-plate
of judgment with cunning work, after the manner of the Ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue,
and of purple, and of scarlet, and of line-twined linen shalt thou make it. Four~square shall
it be, being doubled. And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones, 8:c-
And thou shalt make upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, of wreathen work and pure gold,
and two rings of gold; and thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings, 8¢c.,
and thou shalt put in the breast-plate of judgment the nam and the rsummi, and they shall bc
upon Aaron's heart when he goeth before the Lord."
There is no
mistaking this description of the breast-plate of the Jews. The chains excepted,
it has no resemblance to that of our Hibernian Druids.
Looking into Buxtorfs Chaldee Lexicon, I found Ioden signified the breast-plate, and that
Moran did the same: but I could no where End Ioden-Moran compounded. The commentators
in my possession a.Eorded no information. I then applied by letter to R. J. J. Heideck, Pro-
fessor of Oriental Languages, and received the following answer:
"
Sta,
"I End bB¥t'D|'T tim? Iam lmupt, chosen hemisphot, or the breast-plate ofjudgment, named Ioden
Moren, by Rah. Joda, in Talmud Sanhedrim, p. 134. And in Comm. Ein Jacob, p. 150, it is
derived Eoin the imperfect verb UWT hes, which he says is Moren; and DDM: mspt, he says is the
same as Ioden; and he adds, that the words Urim and Thummim have the same signihcation;
but Rah. Simon, in ejus. pp. 135 and 151, more plainly says it is Moren Ioden; which, according
to Rah. Solomon Iarchi, is also Ioden Moran. Rah. Meir calls it Deen Moren. The Rah. in
Talmud'say, that the Messina shall be called Ioden Mui-en, for he shall he the judge, as in Isaiah xi.
Thus, Sir, it is very plain that the Irish name is derived from the Chaldea Choshen Hemeshpot, or
Ioden Moren.*

In the Irish language, Dunn is a judge, and Maor, a lord or chief. The explanation given by
Buxtorf to Moran or Maran, so perfectly corresponds to Kcating's picture of Moran, one would
think the Irish word had originally the same
meaning. DD mm, Moran, Dominus dicitur, autem

it is translated in the English; hut the commentators all explain the word byprophetic Domini.

BRIMHAM, YORKSHIRE.
Tun following is an extract from a letter by Harman Rooxn, Esq., in the eighth
volume of the Transactions ofMe Ant. Soc. Land.
Tl e success I met with in discovering the Druidical monuments in Derbyshire, induced me to
I
make an excursion into Yorkshire, to examine some curious groups of rocks, seven miles from
Ri le on the road to Patley-bridge, called Brimbam Rocks. They are, indeed, a most wonderful
P Y:
assemblage, scattered about the moor in groups which, altogether, occupy a
space of above forty
acres. 'I'he extraordinary position of these rocks, in a variety of directions, mu t have been oc-
casioned by some violent convulsion of nature, but at the same time it is evident, that art has not
been wanting to make their situations still more wonderful.
The ancients of very remote antiquity have shewed a regard to fragments of rocks. The learned
Mr. Bryant tells us, "That the Egyptians looked upon these with a degree of veneration, and
some of them they kept as they found them, with perhaps only an hieroglyphic; others they shaped
with tools, and formed into various devices." (Analysis ofdnt. Myth. VoL Ill. p. 53.) Again he
"
It was usual with much labour, to place one vast stone upon another for a religious
says, ,
memorial: the stones thus placed, they oftentimes poised so equally, that they were a&'ected with
the least external force° nay, a breath of wind would sometimes make them vibrate. We have
I
many instances of this nature in our own country; and they are to he found in other parts of the
' °
." Anal. Ant.
world, and whenever they occur we may esteem them of the highest antiquity
Mythol. Vol. III. p. 532.
The lirstl shall notice is an extraordinary group of rocks, in which there seems to be a kind of
uniformity preserved. On the top are three rocking-stones: the middle one rests upon a kind of
d tal, and is su sed to be about 100 tons' weight: on each side is a small one. On examin-
pe es ppo
ing one of the stones, it appeared to have been shaped to a small knob at the bottom to give it
motion, though my guide, who was seventy years old, born on the moore, and well acquainted
'th th cks usured me that stone had never been known to rock: however, upon my
wi ese ro , ,
making atrial round it, when I came to the middle of one side, I found it moved with great ease.
The astouishin increase of the motion, with the little force I gave it, made me very apprehensive
S
the equilibrium might be destroyed 3 but on examining it, I found it was so nicely balanced, that
there was no danger of its falling.
Th construction of this equipoised stone must have been by artists well skilled in the powers
e
of mechanics. It is, indeed, the most extraordinary rocking- stone I ever met with, and it is some-
.
_
d
what as extraordinary that it never should have been discovered before, and that it shoul now
move so easily, after so many ages of rest.
No 6, Pl 35, is a north view ofa very singular rock, in a wonderful position. It must undoubtedly
have been a rock idol, or a stone consecrated to some principal deity. It is forty-six feet in cir-

cumference, and seems to have been separated from the adjoining rock. The pedestal it rem;
upon is, at the top, only one foot by two feet, seven inches. The marks of the tool are vigiblg in
many places, particularly on the base of the pedestal, which has been shaped into a
polygon,
tending towards a hexagon, but part of the sides has been defaced by time. The hazardous
undertaking of shaping this rock and pedestal is, I think, another proof of the Druids having had
some knowledge of mechanism. We are well assured that the ancients shaped rocks into various
forms, for some mystical purpose.
The next I shall notice is a very singular kind of monument, which I believe has never been
taken notice of by any antiquary. I think I may call it an oruculm- stone, though it goes by the
name of the great cannon. It rests upon a bed of rock, where a road plainly appears to have been
made leading to the hole which, at the entrance, is three feet wide, six feet deep, and about three
feet, six inches high. Within this aperture on the right hand is a round hole, two feet diameter,
perforated quite through the rock, sixteen feet, and running from south to north. In the above-
mentioned aperture a man might lie concealed, and predict future events to those that came to
consult the oracle, and be heard distinctly on the north side of the rock, where the hole is not
visible. This might make the credulous Britons think the predictions proceeded solely from the
rock deity. The voice on the outside was distinctly conveyed to the person in the aperture, as
was several times tried. The circumference of this rock is ninety-six feet!
About a
quarter of a mile from this, there is to the west a Druid circle, with a vallum of earth
and stones, thirty feet in diameter. There are likewise several small tumuli. Thirteen of them
are ranged in a kind of circle, the largest not above eighteen feet in diameter. They are formed
of earth and large stones: two of these I opened. Towards the bottom the effects of iire appeared
on the stones, and ashes were scattered about, but there were no ums to be found.
Here are several rocks that have passages cut through them. There is one very large, with
au aperture three feet and a half wide, in which is a rock-bason three feet diameter. Near this
is another, where art seems to have been aiding in the singularity of its position. A rock-bason
appears upon it; and, from the lips or channels on the sides (for the water to run 06), we may
conclude there are more on the top; but that could not be examined from its elevated situation.
No. 2 is a west view of a rock, called by the country people Noon Stone, from its casting a
shadow on a cottage at 12 o'c1ock. A1- mnsummn ave rlnas .mn uoarun os 'run sins (a).
Its situation is apposite for this purpose, being on the edge of a hill commanding an extensive
view. This custom is of the most remote antiquity. Arch. Sac. Ant. Ladd. Vol. VIII.

RUDSTON, EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE.
Oven the whole of the British islands large single stones of immense size, perfectly
plain, unworked, and without inscription, are found, which will be often referred to in
the following work. The same
general character pervades the whole. I shall therefore
only give a plate* of one of them, and I shall select one which appears to me to be the
most curious. In the churchyard of the village of Rudstone, in the East Riding ol'
Yorkshire, there stands fixed in the ground a
single upright stone, the origin of which,
or the purpose for which erected, is totally unknown. It stands about four yards
from the north-east corner of Rudstone church, which is situated on a high hill. Its
depth under ground is equal to its height above, a fact which was ascertained, as it is
stated in the fifth volume of the Archazologia Soc. Land., by Sir Pwlliam Strickland, Bart.,
in the year 1776. All the four sides are a little convex, and the whole covered with
moss. It is of a
very hard kind of stone. It is twenty-four feet long above ground, and
if it be the same below, it will be forty-eight feet long, and it is live feet, ten broad, and
two feet thick. The weight of it has been computed at upwards of forty tons. The
village probably took its name from the stone. The word Rud in Yorkshire means red.
It is spelt Rudstan, and often Ruddestan. Immediately adjoining to the town of Bo-
roughbridge, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and within about a mile of the ancient
capital oi` Britain, Isnun, may be seen three similar stones, almost equally large. Any
persons travelling to or from the north, through Boroughbridge, may gratify themselves
with a
sight of them in less than a quarter of an hour.

PICTS' TOWERS AND HOUSES IN SCOTLAND.
,
Tun remains of one of those singular structures, called Pictish Towers, is found not far from
this lace (the Druid's temple, near Bernera, in the Isle of Lewis,) connected with a subterranean
P 1
passage, which is supposed by the natives to reach the ses. To trace the date or the authors of
'
l h
these buildings, appears a
hopeless attempt, as no
analogous works appear to exist e sew ere,
and neither carvings, monuments, nor inscriptions, have been found attached to them, so as to
give a probable clue towards the discovery. It is unnecessary here to notice the impropriety of
°
d tb rthem
the appellation, but it is not unimportant to remark, that they are all limite to e no
division of Scotland. From that situation it is probable that they were the works ofthe North-
men, whose colonies possessed these tracts, an
opinion cond:-med by the northern name Dor-
` ' ' `
. Th st
nadilla, the only local title among them, as far as I have discovered, now
existing e mo
southern are those in Glen Elg, and on the Frith of Tain. They are numerous in Sutherland;
although, with the exception of Dun Dornadill, these are now all nearly levelled to the ground.
f th
°
tructure for which I may
In Glen Elg they are
sumciently entire to convey a perfect idea o eu' s ,
refer to Pennant, in whose work they are accurately represented.
The three in Glen Elg are of the same size, or
nearly so. Those in Sutherland vary, and in
'
far as can be °udged from
some instances appear to have been of somewhat smaller dimensions, as
J
their present dilapidated state. It is very dimcult to comprehend the design of the architects,
since the upper galleries, that lie between the inner and outer wall, are msuicxent to admit a man:
'
b ries rovided with external
in some, a child could scarcely creep along. Nor are t ese galle p
apertures for defence; a circumstance which bespeaks the purpose of that construction in the
d
'
those kee s which like that of Restormel Castle, consist of two con-
Galloway towers, an in
p ,
centric walls, with an interior space. It is probable- that they were
merely the strong houses of
the chiehains of those days, the internal area being perhaps appropriated to the occasional inclosure
al arfare Ot' their relative antiquity to those much more
singular
of the cattle, in cases of arm or w .
buildings, the vitrihed works, it is impossible to conjecture.-M/lccunnocu, Western Islands,
VoL I. p. 188, 8vo.
Plate 37 contains drawings of one of these towers, called the Burg of Mousa.
The following is another description of these singular buildings, which set all con-
jecture at defiance; for the various hypotheses which are
suggested by difi`erent indi-
viduals are
very unsatisfactory. It is extraordinary that there should exist neither
rational record nor tradition respecting their use or
origin.
The Dun of Dornadilla is so called from an imaginary prince, who reigned two hundred and
sixty years before the Christian era. This appears to be so well described by an
anonymous
1. 2
lxxvi Prcrs' 'rowzns-nescarrrros or stuns.
writer in the Edinlmrgb Magazine, that I shall copy it, as it may be acceptable to my reader. "
In
the most northern part of Scotland, called Lord Reay's counhy, not far from Tongue, and near
the end of the river which runs into the North Sea at Loch Eribol, are the remains of a stone tower,
which I apprehend to be a Druidic work, and to be the greatest piece of antiquity in this island.
This tower is called by the neighbouring inhabitants the Dune of Dornadilla. It is of a circular
form, and now nearly resembling the frustum of a cone : whether, when perfect, it terminated in
a point, I cannot pretend to guess: but it seems to have been higher, by the rubbish which lies
round it. It is built of stone, without cement, and I take it to be between 20 and 30 feet high
still. The entrance is by a low and narrow door, to pass through which, one is obliged to stoop
much; but perhaps the ground may have been raised since the iirst erection.
When one is got in, and placed in the centre, it is open over head. All round the sides of
the walls are ranged stone shelves, one above another, like a circular beaufait, reaching from near
the bottom to the top. The stones which compose these shelves are supported chiedy by the
stones which form the walls, and which project all round, just in that place where the shelves are,
and in no others: each of the shelves is separated into several divisions, as in a bookcase. There
are some remains of an awkward staircase. What use the shelves could be applied to I cannot
conceive. It could not be of any military use &om its situation at the bottom of a sloping hill,
which wholly commands it. The most learned amongst the inhabitants, such as the gentry and
clergy, who all speak the Irish language, could give no infomation or tradition concerning its
use, or the origin or meaning of its name.-PsNr1aN'r's Tour in Scotland, Vol. l.I. p.394.
From the plate given by Mr. Pennant, it is evidently identically the same as the tower
called the Burg qfMous'a, only in a more ruinous state.

( lxxvii )
BURG OF MOUSA.
THE following is the description of this very curious building, given by Dr. Hransar
in his Jozu'ne_y fo the Shel/and Isles.
I passed along the shore of the open bay of Sandwick, which has been the grave of many seamen,
who, by mistaking it for Brassay harbour, have suffered all the horrors of shipwreck upon its
exposed shores. In crossing a headland to the east of the inlet, a small low island, named Mousa,
se arated from the main land by a narrow strait, first rises to view: this spot is little diversxhed
P
with hill and dale: it contains one good house with outbuildings and cottages. But the most
conspicuous object that lines its shores is the Burg of Mousa, a circular building, which, if it did
but taper towards its summit, would present no unapt similxtude to a modern glass-house. This
' °
chan-
ancient fortress stands close to the water's edge; by crossing, therefore, m a boat, a narrow
nel, little more than half a mile in breadth, we landed immediately under its walls.
The Burg of Mousa occupies a circular site of ground, somewhat more than fifty feet in diameter,
being constructed of middle-sized schistose stones of a tolerably uniform magnitude, well laid
to ther without the intervention of any cement. This very simple round ediice attains the
§¢ »
elevation of 42 feet: it swells out, or
bulges from its foundation, and draws smaller as it approaches
the top, when it is again cast out from its lesser diameter; which singularity of construction is
'
d d t obviate the possibility of scaling the walls. The door that leads to the open area
xnten e o
contained within the structure, is a small narrow passage, so low that an entrance is only to be
accom lished by crawling upon the hands and kne : and in creeping through it, the wall appears
P
of the great thickness of I5 feet, naturally leading to the suspicion of a
vacmty withui. On amv-
th to
ing at the open circular area included within this mural shell, I found the diameter of e
space
be about 21 feet. On that part of the wall within the court, which is nearly opposite to the
entrance, the attention is excited by a number of small apertures resembling the holes of a
pigeon-
'
f
house. There are three or four vertical rows of them, having each an imequal proportion o
°
va 'n from eight to eighteen in number It was now evident, that the mural shell of
openings, ryi g .
the structure was hollow, and that it contained chambers, to which these holes imparted a feeble
. .
d
su l of light and air. Beneath the whole, at alittle distance from the ground, there is a oor
PP Y
that leads to a
winding flight of stone steps, of the width of three feet, which communicates with

osed of two concentric
all these apartments. I then discovered that the shell of the Burg was comp
walls each of about 4§ to ive feet in breadth, and that a space of nearly a similar dimension was
J
ed th truction of the inner apartments In ascendmg these steps, which wound
devot to e cons .
gradually to the top of the wall, I observed that they communicated, at regular intervals, with
many chambers or galleries, one above another, that went round the building. These were seve-

rally of such a height, that it was possible to walk within them nearly upright. The roof of the
lowest chamber was the door of the second, and after this manner seven tiers were raised. On
reaching the highest step of the Bight of stairs, there appeared no reason for supposing that any
roof had ever protected the summit of the building, so that the Burgh of Mousa must have been
originally nothing more than a circular mural shell, open to the top. The height of the inside wall
was 35 feet, being seven feet less than that of the outside: this diferenee was partly owing to the
accumulation of stones and earth, which had illed the inner court.
The mode was now evident in which this Burg had been intended to give security to the persons
and property of the ancient inhabitants of Shetland against the sudden landing of predatory adven-
turers. The tiers of apartments contained within the thick walls, would afford a shelter to women
and children, from the missile weapons of assailants, besides being repositories for grain and other
kinds of property, as well as for the stores whereby a long siege might be sustained. The low
narrow door within the court, which admits of no entrance but in a creeping posture, might be easily
secured at a short notice by large blocks of stone. lt has been remarked of the rude forts similar
to these which occur on the shores of Scandinavia, that they were seldom taken by an
enemy,
unless by surprise, or after a long blockade: that frequently terraces and artiicial banks were
raised near that side of the wall which was the lowest, and that the besieged were then annoyed
with arrows, stones, boiling water, or melted pitch being thrown into the fort ;-offensive wea-
pons which they did not neglect to retum. (MALLBT°8 Northern Antiquitrhs, Vol. I. p. 244.) The
history of the Burgh of Mousa confirms the correctness of this observation: its high walls bulging
out from their foundation, deded any attempt to scale them; for when they were encompassed by
one of the Earls of Orkney, he had no hopes of inducing the fortress to surrender, but by cutting
od' all supply of food, and then waiting the event of along siege. Altogether the building was well
adapted for resisting the attacks of the ancient piratical hordes of these seas, who, from the short
summers of northern latitudes, and from the incapability of their vessels to sustain a winter's
navigation, durst not allow themselves to be detained on the coast by any tedious operations of
assault. Before I quitted the Burgh of Mouse, I endeavoured to explore some of the chambers
belonging to it, but owing to the ruined state of the doors, the attempt was too hazardous.
Hxsaea'r's Slaetlaud Isles, pp. 250, &c.
There is also another kind of ancient buildings called Piglits' or Picts' Houses, to be
niet with in many parts of Scotland. On their arrival they were
_/band by the earHest
tribes qfnortbem invaders qfwhom we /love any account. Many of them still exist in the
Orkneys, which Torfhzus says were discovered 4-00 years, and inhabited 260 years, previ-
ous to the Christian ara. These islands were conquered by Agricola or Claudian. Dr.
Ailcin says,
These houses, as they are termed, are more curious still, as they shew that the persons to whom
they must be attributed were probably the original inhabitants, who were a race unknown to the
people of the north. These are numerous, and are found in the holmes in the midst of Lochs,
with a stony ford or causeway attached, as a
passage to them; on the points of very high lands,
or on strands on the sea-shore, more especially near places adapted for landing with facility. Their
situation points out their intention: they were
evidently the barracks or habitations of those
suns or srocsa-nascarrrros or Pnarss. lxxix
appointed for the defence of the isles: and what confirms this is, that they stretch in a
regular
chain from one headland to another, in a full view of the adjacent harbours and distant ocean."
The following is Dr. Bamfs description of a
large one
(for they vary in size)
at Quanterness:
As works of that nature have never been clearly understood, though they have excited much
curiosity in men who take pleasure in studying the progress of the human mind, by looking back
to early ages, the utmost attention has been given to examine that Picts' house with care, to
measure its dimensions accurately, and to delineate the form of all its parts with precision.
Situated on a
gentle declivity, under the brow of the hill of Wideford, it looks toward the north
isles; has a full view of the bay of Frith, and the pleasant little island of Dansey, from which it is
not far distant, and lies little more than s mile west from the road or harbour of Kirkwall. Like the
rest, it bears externally the form of a truncated cone, the height of which is about fourteen feet,
and the circumference at the base three hundred and eighty-four. But whether, like them also, it
be surrounded hy one or two circular walls, the quantity of rubbish prevented us from discovering,
though, that it is so, is very probable. In one
respect it dilfers from most of them, as it stands
alone, and at a distance from the shore; whereas, in general, they are situated on the shores of the
sea, and several of them at no
great distance from, and in full view ot, one another, as if they were
some way or other connected, or had been intended for mutual communication.
Internally it consists of several cells or apartments, the principal one of which is in the centre,
twenty-one feet, six inches long; six feet, six inches broad, and eleven feet, six inches high ; built
without any cement, with large Bat stones, the one
immediately above projected over that immedi-
ately below, so as
gradually to contract the space within as the building rises, till the opposite
walls meet at the top, where they are bound together bylarge stones laid across, to serve as it
were for key-stones. Six other apartments of an exactly similar form, constructed with the same
sort of materials, and united in the same manner, but of little more than half the dimensions, com-
municate with this in the centre, each by a passage about two feet square, on a level with the
door: and the whole may be considered as connected together by a
passage of nearly the same
extent from without, which leads into this chief apartment. So far as can now be discovered,
there does not appear ever to have been, in any part of the building, either chinlc or hole for the
admission of air or
light: and this circumstance alone is sumcient to shew that it had not been
destined for the abode of men. The contents were
accordingly such as
might have been naturally
expected in such a
gloomy mansion. None of those things which have been discovered in similar
places were found here: but the earth at the bottom of the cells, as
deep as it could be dug, was of
a dark colour, of a greasy feel, and of a fetid odour, plentifully intermingled with bones, some of
which were almost entirely consumed : and others had, in defiance of time, remained so entire as
to shew that they were the bones of men, of birds, and of some domestic animals. But though
many of them had nearly mouldered into dust, they exhibited no marks of having been burnt; nor
were ashes of any kind to be seen within any part of the building. In one of the apartments, an
entire human skeleton, in a
prone attitude, was found: but in the others, the bones were not only
separated from one another, but divided into very small fragments.
There are several peculiarities belonging to this building at Quanterness, which make
it very difficult to imagine for what it can have been intended. It seems
very singular as

mode of closing the building at the top by overhanging stones, seems an approximation

look like an unshapely mass of stones. Tour in Scot. Vol. I. p. 318.
From the circumstance of no mortar or cement being used, and of there being no sign
of the arch, I should suspect that these buildings are very ancient. But nothing can be

little information would be conveyed; and on the outside they merely exhibit a round

VITRIFIED FORTS.
Tar: following is an account of the vitrgfedjbrts of Scotland, which I believe is gene.
rall considered to have settled the question respecting them. It was written by Mr.
Y
James Anderson; dated Monkshill, April, 1777, Vol. V. Arch. Soc. Ant. Land.
The most remarkable of all the Scottish antiquities are the vitriied walls# It is not yet threg
years since I got the irst hint of this species of building, from a
gentleman who had examined
them with attention and who was, I believe, the lirst person who took notice of them in Scotland.

admit this phrase) that resists the vicissitudes of the weather, perhaps better than any other al-gi.
iicial cement that has ever yet been discovered.
All the walls of this kind that I have yet seen or heard of, have been evidently erected as
plug;
fd f The for the most part, surround a small area on the top of some steep conical hill
o e ence. y,
of very diliicult access. It ohen happens that there is easier access to the top of one of these hills
'
to th fo which has
at one place than at any other; and these have always had the entry in e rt,
always been defended by outworks, more or less strong, according to the degree of declivity at
that place.
The first fortiication of this kind that I saw was upon the top of a
steep hill, called K1w¢]¢.
ferrel, two miles west from Dingwall, in Ross-shire. And as an idea may he formed from this one
of all the others, I shall subjoin a
description of it.

The hill is of a
longish form, rising into a ridge at top, long in
proportion 1

°

from either end, it appears of a conical shape, very perfect and beantinal to look at: but wh
viewed from one side, one of the ends is seen to be much steeper than the other.
The narrow declivity of the hill is of easy access, and forms a natural road by which you may
ascend to the top on horseback: and at this end has been the entry of the fort, A. This fort con-
sists, as I guessed by the eye, of a
long elliptical area of near an acre, which is entirely level,
ex tin towards each end, where it falls a little lower than in the middle. The fortiiication of
°°P S
vitriiied wall, CCCC, is continued quite round this area; being adapted to the form of the hill, so

as to stand on the brink of a
preerplce all round, unless it be at the place where you enter, an at
the opposite end B ; both which places have been defended by ontworks. Those at the entry had

extended, as I guessed, about 100 yards, and seem to have consisted of cross walls one behind

these walls there must have been a gate, so that the besiegers would have been under the necessity
f f
°
each of these gates successively before they could can'y the fort: on the opposite end of
o orcing
the hill, as the ground is considerably steeper, the outworks seem not to have extended above 20
yards, and consist only of two or three cross walls. Not Ear from the further end was a well,
marked D, now filled up, but still discernible.
The wall, all round from the inside, appears to be only a mound of rubbish, consisting of loose
stones now buried among some earth and grass that has been gradually accumulated by the dung-
ing of sheep which resort to it as a place of shelter. The vitriiied wall is only to be seen on the
outside.
It appears at first sight surprising, that a rude people should have been capable of discovering a
cement of such a
singular kind as this is. It is less surprising that the knowledge of it should not
have been carried into other countries, as distant nations in those periods had but little friendly
intercourse with one another. But it is no dillicult matter for one who is acquainted with the
nature of the country where these structures abound, to give a very probable account of the man-
ner in which this art has been originally discovered, and of the causes that have occasioned the
knowledge of it to be lost, even in the countries where it was universally practised.
Through all the northern parts of Scotland, a particular kind of earthy iron ore, of a
very vitres-
cible nature, much abounds. 'This ore might have been accidentally mixed with some stones at a
place where a great ire was kindled, and being fused by the heat would cement the stones into one
solid mass, and give the first hint of the uses to which it might be applied. A few experiments
would satisfy them of the possibility of executing at large what had been accidentally discovered in
miniature.
This knowledge being thus obtained, nothing seems to be more simple and natural than its
application to the formation of the walls of these fortided places.
Having made choice of a proper place for their fort, they would rear a wall all round the area,
building the outside of it as firm as they could, of dry stones piled one above another, the inter-
stices between them being lilled full of this vitrescible iron ore, and the whole supported by a
backing of loose stones piled carelessly behind it.
`
When the wall was thus far completed, with its facing all round reared to the height they wished
for, nothing more was necessary to give it the entire hnishing but to kindle a tire all round it sui-
ciently intense to melt the vitrescible ore, and thus to cement the whole into one coherent mass, as
far as the iuduence of that heat extended. As the country then abounded with wood, this purpose
would be readily effected by building a stack of wood round the whole outside of the wall, and then
setting it on fire.
An ingenious gentleman called Williams, caused a section to be made across the top of the hill
of Knock-ferrel, which was carried quite through the walls on each side, in the line marked F F,
Plate 38, so that any person has now an opportunity of observing the nature of these walls, and
may judge of the manner in which they have been constructed. lt appears by this section, here
represented in Fig. 2, that the wall all round is covered on the outside with a crust of about two
feet in thickness, consisting of stones immersed among vitrilied matter: some of the stones being
hall' fused themselves where the beat has been greatest, and all of them having evidently sufered
a considerable heat. This crust is of an equal thickness of about two feet from top to bottom, so
as to lie upon and be supported by the loose stones behind it. Within that crust of vitrihed
matter is another stratum, of some thickness, running from top to bottom, exactly parallel to the
VITRIFIED FOB'1'S°-'DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. lxxxiii
former, which consists of loose stones, which have been scorched by the Ere, but discover no marks
of fusion.
Nothing seems to he more judicious or
simple than this mode of fortilication adopted by our
forefathers. The stone for forming the walls were
probably dug from the top of the rock that
formed the ridge of the hill, and therefore served at once to level the area of the fort, and to erect
the massy walls without any expense of carriage. These forts are
very common in Scotland.
On these forts Dr. Msccmmocn makes the following observation:
"
In spite of this deficiency, there appears thus to be an oriental cast about the history of this
art and these vitriied forts, which leads us back to the early Celtic tribes; while this species of
antiquity and origin is countenanced by all those numerous facts noticed in various parts of these
letters, which indicate the remote Eastern origin of that fer-spread people."-Higldands, Vol. I.
p. 299.

CROMLEHS IN MALABAR.
Tun two Plates, 89 and 40, are representations of Cromlehs in Malabar. They are
copied from the History/qfWilts/iire, by Sn. Rrcnann Cow Hoann, Bart. It is
rather remarkable that he has not accompanied them with any observations. But his
character is too well known to admit a suspicion of their genuineness. They willbe
tbund to aH`ord something very like the link ofa chain between the East and West, when
a
variety of circumstances are considered, which will be met with in the following work.
They are evidently the same as the Cromlehs in Britain.

STONES OF STENNIS.
,,_i1
Oven the Orkneys are scattered many single stones, rude as out of the quarry, but in
*
there are Triads, and in one instance with one of
two places described by Dr. Bannv,
the stones thrown down. There are also circles which probably have formerly had stones
`
th d there are some where they yet remain. Amongst these monuments, that
in em, an
called the Stones of Stennis, Plate 41, claims the principal attention. It consists of a
I
semi-circle, nearly 100 feet in diameter, surrounded bya mound of earth, with singe
t nes standin erect in the interior and is situated on the eastern side of the Loch Sten-
s o g ,
nis. On the western side is a complete circle, 800 feet in diameter, surrounded by a ditch
di
twenty feet broad and twelve deep: and on the inside, by a range of stan ng stones,
twelve and fourteen feet high, and four broad. These are accompanied by four barrows of
considerable magnitude, and other erect stones on the margin of the lake. In the centre
be d bttial, and a round hole
is a flat stone, the use of which Dr. Barry thinks cannot ou
discoverable in one, whose edges are worn, he supposes, for the purpose of binding the
° '
all 'iiced on the altar On this curious monument Dr. Aikin observes,
victim usu y sacn .
that from its form it is evidently coeval with similar ones found in England and Wales,
as Stonehenge, in Wiltshire; Rolrich, in Oxfordshire; Buarth Arthur, in Caermarthen»

CARNAC.
THE following is translated from the work of Mons. Da Camsav, called Monumens
Celtigues, and refers to Plates 42, 4-3, 4-4-, 4-5.
Tun little town of Carnac is situated three leagues from the town of Auray, in the department
of Morbihan.
Near this place, and on the coast, is to be found the monument of rude stones of which I will
give the description.
Messr. de Caylus, La Sauvsgere, Latour d' Auvergne, the General Pomereuil, and the Admiral
Thevenard, have spoken of this strange colonnade ot' granite.
The road from Auray to Carnac is extremely dihioultg it is traversed by hills and cross-roads,
which are almost impassable. There cannot be a more wild or deserted district-or scenes less
calculated to remind one of civilization and the enjoyments of an enlightenedpeople. The airy steeple
of Carnac is discovered long before you come near it. Some long stones, placed on the hills and on
the hillocks of sand, precede the great theatre of which you are in quest. On the left and afar of
we saw in the horizon heaps of stones, which we avoided, tal-ring them for parts of walls or some
ruined fortress: we reached at length one of the hounds of the monument towards the West. I
will not attempt to describe to you my surprise st the sight of these wonderful masses stretching
towards the horizon, in the midst of the desert which surrounds them; of this monument, so
simple and majestic, so prodigious from its extent, and the labour it must have cost.
It is there without any thing but the sand on which it rests, and the arch of heaven which covers
it; no inscription to explain it, no analogy to guide one in the research. The person whom you
call to your aid, or the traveller of whom you inquire, looks at it and turns aside, or tells you some
ridiculous story: as, that it was an old camp of Caesar-'s; an army turned into stone; or that it is
work of the C1-ions, little men or demons, two or three feet in height, who are supposed to have
carried these huge blocks in their hands; they are more powerihl than Giants. These Crions
or Gorics are supposed to dance during the night about the Druidical monuments. Woe to the
traveller who passes that way within their reach. He is forced into the rapid dance; he falls
down amid the bursts of laughter of these Dusii, or wanton hobgoblins, who disappear at break of
day.
An old sailor, however, told me in answer two striking circumstances z--Ist, That one of these
stones still covers an immense treasure; and the better to hide it the many thousand others had
been raised ; and that a calculation, of which the key was only to he found in the Tower of London,
could alone indicate the position of the treasure. This reminds one of the sacred shields, the
andlia of the Romans. 2d, That in the month of June each year, the ancients added a stone to
those already set up, and that they were illuminated at great expense the night preceding this
ceremony.
This monument belonged doubtless to Astronomy: it was a celestial problem, of which it is
dimcult to give the plan or perceive all its bearings.

Its position from East to West; the conviction that Religion alone can
urge men to the execu-
tion of such immense works; the exact time of the year; for they are supposed to have been
placed precisely at the summer solstice, and many other facts which I shall adduce, lead me to
this conjecture.
These stones are placed in eleven straight lines, which are from thirty to thirty-three feet dis-
tant. The space between the stones in the lines varies from twelve to iifteen feet. They do not,
therefore, together form n quincunx as Ogée has stated.
I must acknowledge that I sought for a 12th line, to establish some connexion between the
Zodiac and this prodigious work of our ancestors; but in vain. One should not, however, re-
nounce this idea, if it is true, (as the author of the .Monument singuliers asserts in his Treatise on
Judicial Astrology, Paris, 1739, p. 432,) that the more ancient astronomers only acknowledged
eleven signs in the Zodiac, which the Greeks increased to twelve, by placing Libra instead of the
Claws of Scorpion, and by confining this latter to the space before occupied by its Tail. And
doubtless, if this monument of Camac has any connexion with the course of the heavenly bodies,
it must he with that which was
assigned to them in the most remote antiquity.
This monument o&`ered yearly to the stars reminds one of the nails of the Capitol and of the
Etruscans, which noted the years in these nations before they adopted written signs in their reli-
gious ceremonies. Nothing probable has been assigned to this custom, though a Dissertation in
the sixth volume ofthe £lIe'moires de I' Academic des Insmlotions attempts to develop its mystery.
The stars may be thought to resemble the heads of nails driven into the celestial arch; by placing
a fresh nail in the temple of Jupiter, in the time of a
plague, or the falling of meteoric stones, or
when any extraordinary and fearful event took place, they placed themselves under the protection
of a new Star, or Deity, and prayed that he would cause to cease a
scourge which, in spite of the
vows and numerous sacrihces of the priests, the other Gods had not been able to avert. When
we would explain the great mysteries of nations, we must never lose sight of the fundamental
and simple relations which they must have adopted. It is perhaps the idea we have of the great-
ness of the mysteries which are supposed to be written on the Temples and Obelisks of Egypt,
that prevents our being able to explain them.
I have measured die largest stones at Carnac. The most elevated are 21 or 22 feet above the
ground. Their breadth and thickness varyas well as their height: but some of them are enor-
mous, especially in the part near Kervario, near the mill of Kerner. One of them is 22 feet high,
12 broad, and Gtbick, exclusive of what is concealed by the sand; it must weigh 256,800 lbs.,
supposing the cubic foot of granite at 200 lbs.
From Kervario the sea and low-lands are discovered at a distance-the view is most interesting,
and the more so as one cannot avoid being struck with astonishment and wonder at the surrounding
objects. M. de Caylus was deceived by incorrect accounts of Carnac. He attempts to give an
idea of it in the sixth volume of his : his reasoning about it is not much better than his
plate. He supposes them tombs; and that a foreign people placed them, Ste., &c. Ogée and
Deslandes, curious antiquaries, will have it that the stones of Carnac were a camp for Caesar and
an entrenchment for his troops, and that they were placed by the Romans.
These errors in men of great merit arose from precipitancy in forming their judgment, from the
little pains they had taken in investigating remains of this sort, and especially from the prejudice
which supposes the ancient Gauls to have been Barbarians. It is pretty well agreed, *lm fl1¢
stones are 4000 in number; the most exact account of them would not serve in explaining the
mystery, as a great number have been destroyed.
lxxxviii canuac-nsscsrrnou or rnarss.
Ogée makes out that those which are standing occupy a space of 670 toises, and that the marks
of those which have been removed came near to La Truuté, in a hne of 1490 toises.
M. Boulay, an enlightened inhabitant of Auray, states, that they extended formerly nearly three
leagues along the coast.
These stones have the most extrao mary app .
without trees or bushes-not a flint or fragment of stone is to be seen on the sand which supports
them ; they are poised without foundations, several of them are moveable: the annexed plates
give a pretty just view of them, but cannot produce the eEect of the original. They bring to our
minds a period not to be reached by history or calculation. I have been all my life making
researches into Celtic antiquities ; the sight of Carnac decided me to give to the world the result
of my thoughts on those which have tbe strongest analogy with this monument : to render which
more intelligible, I have thought it adviseahle to premise ashort dissertation on the Celts and
Druids, which I have derived from the most authentic sources of antiquity.
rd' earance Theyare isolated in a great plain
The above is a translation of the description by M. Cambry of the monument at
Carnac, which, on many accounts, I apprehend is not to be equalled in the world. It
certainly sets all history, and almost all theory, at dehance. However, I take the
liberty of suggesting whether it may not have been used as an instrument to mark the
passing years, like the Etruscan nails, and may not have been dedicated to the Pleiades.
May it not have been made when the Bull, with his horn, opened the vernal year, and
the monument itself have been formed at first of a number of stones equal to what the
Druids supposed to be the number of years which had passed from the creation or
any
other grand epoch, as tradition says, they annually added a stone to it ? The following is
an extract from the iirst volume of the Asiatic Researches. I dare not undertake to say
that Carnac is Cartic corrupted. Cartic is the Pleiades personified. Carnac is cor-
rectly a Celtic word. Vide Tor.. Had. p. 289.
"
It may be remarked, that in the foregoing arrangement of the Breehaapati years, Cartic is
always placed the Brat in the cycle of twelve ; and, since it is a main principle of the Hindoo
astronomy to commence the planetary motions, which are the measures of time, from the same
point of the ecliptic, it may thence be inferred, that there was a time when the Hindoo solar year,
as well as the Breehaspati cycle of twelve, began with the Sun's arrival in or near the Nacslaatm
Critica, or the Bull, on whose neck the Pleiades are
placed in the celestial sphere."-M_Uarcs,
Ind. Ant. Vol. VI. p. 206.
The observation of M. Cambry respecting the eleven signs of the Zodiac is not alto-
gether devoid of probability. The circle was
always, I believe, divided into twelve pnr_
titions ; but two of them were given to Scorpio, so that there were twelve partitions, but
only eleven signs. One was occupied by the body of the animal, the other by the tail.
It was the devil, the evil principle. In the distribution of the signs amongst the children
of Israel, Scorpio fell to the tribe of Dan, which it changed for the eagle and carried on
its standard.

CROMLEH AT TOBIN'S-TOWN COUNTY OF CARLOW.
.-; T11»
Os the West end is a portico formed by two upright pillars, somewhat round but irregular, each
eight feet high, terminated behind by a broad flat stone set on the edge, eight feet high, and nine
feet broad, making a portico of six feet wide and four deep. This is covered by the Cromleh, or
large sloping stone. This stone is twenty-three feet long, eighteen broad at the upper end over the
ortico and six -it the lower or back part, where it rests on small stones about a foot high. Its
p ,
. .
thickness at the upper end is four feet, and at the lower two. The under surface is plain and even,
but the upper convex. The upper part has a
large channel, from which branches a number of
smaller ones: to some they appear natural, to others artiiicisl, for sacrificial purposes. The sides
are enclosed and supported by several upright anomalous stones, from three to six feet high, making
a room eighteen feet long ; eight at the upper or west end, and iive broad at the opposite one, and
from two to eight feet high, perfectly secure against every inconvenience of weather. From the
portico Westward, is a sort of avenue about forty yards long, formed of small, irregular, artificial
hillocks ; this avenue lends to the portico. The Cromleh is situated in a low, plain field, near at
rivulet, on the road from Tullow to Hacket's-town.-Gnoss's Ireland.

KiTT'S COTTY HOUSE, KENT.
~
Krrr's Conv House stands on the brow of a hill, about one mile and a half from Aylesford,
a quarter of a mile to the right of the great road from Rochester to Maidstone, and is composed uf
four vast stones called Kentish Ragg. The dimensions of the stones,-that on the South side is
eight feet high by seven and a half broad, and two feet thick, weight about eight ton. That on the
North, eight feet by eight, and two feet thick, weight two MDS, eight and a quarter. The transverse,
or impost, eleven feet long by eight broad, and two thick, weight sixteen ton, seven hundred.-
According to Camden and others, it is erected over the burial-place of Catigern, brother of
Vortimer, King of the Britons, slain in a battle near
Aylesford, between the Britons and Saxons.

PH(ENICIAN COIN.
¢
Tms Phmnician coin was brought from the ancient Citium by Dr. Clark; an account
of it may be found in his History, Vol. IV. pp. 84- and 77, and in his work called "
Greek
Marbles," p. 78.
A most satisfactory proof, not only of the Phoenician origin of this medal, but of its relationship
to Citium, is afforded by the Citiesn inscriptions, published by Pooocke, (Description of the East,
Vol. II. p. 2l3,) wherein more than one instance occurs of the introduction of the identical symbol,
seen upon its obverse side.-Casas, p. 79.
CHAPTER V.
CROMLEH IN THE COUNTY OF CORK.
Tasse is in Ireland a kind of Pagan temple, covered at the top, called Diomruch, or
Diomrach, and by the vulgar Irish Leibe Darmid, or Learba Diarmad. This, Mr.
Vallencey thinks, was used for magical rites, and that the Druids pretended to bring
down into them the logh, or the divine fire; the following is his account of one, taken
li'om the 4th Vol. of the Collectanea, pp. 4-70, 4-77 :
The most complete Diomruch I have seen in this country, is in the county of Cork, on the road
from Ferrnoy to Glanworth, one mile due East from the latter; it stands on a plain, and consists of
two parts: the lirst of seven
large pillars, three on each side, and one at the extremity, covered with
a fiat stone, fifteen feet long and eight broad, and three and a. halfthick at a mean. This stands in
an East and West direction. Close to the East of this building, is another colonnade, consisting of
four upright pillars, covered with a Bat stone, six feet long and eight broad, in the same direction
with the Brat; the whole terminates with a third Bat stone of equal dimensions with the second,
supported also by four pillars in lines gradually approaching each other: between the two last
opposite pillars at the East end, there is a door or entrance about two feet and a half wide: the
entire length of the three colonnades is about twenty-seven feet. At the West end appear the
remains of the Dearthach, or Vestibulum, consisting of two rows of pillars, diverging from each
other as
they proceed to the West ; three only of these pillars are to be seen at present, two on one

side, and one on the other, the rest being either destroyed or buried under ground. Besides these,
there are two rows of shorter pillars surrounding the whole fabric, not in a circular, but rather in an
oval form : the intermediate space between these two oval rows, is about ten feet wide, and the
distance between the inner row and the colonnade supporting the roof or
covering, is about live feet;
at this distance, I think the multitude were to keep, waiting the answer of the Oracle, or Meiseith,
which was
probably kept in the central Chapel, or the Diomruch. All this appears to have been only
part of a greater work, resembling the "vm abiri, or
Abury of England, described by Stukeley, and
proved, by Dr. Cooke, to have been a Phoenician temple.

In the county of Dorset is a tumulus, or barrow, with an immense stone at the top of it, called

harrosv at the top is 60 feet; its bottom occupies half an acre of ground ; the perpendicular height
is 90 feet. Round the bottom appear traces of a shallow ditch.
The stone is of a red-heath sand, or moor-stone, which, though very common, does not abound
hereabouts. lts form is that of a pyramid inverted, or an
irregular triangle, one of whose sides is
placed uppermost. On the East front it is convex, or gibbous: on the West nearly Hat. There is
a considerable cleft in the middle from East to West. On the surface of it are three rock basons,
in which ravens are bred. The girt, or circumference at the bottom, is 60 feet; in the middle 80;
near the top 90. It is 18 feet high. But these measurements are not very exact, by reason of the
irregularity of the surface. The quarriers compute that it contains 400 tons of stone. Its history
is totally unknown.-Hufcmus' Hist. Dorset, p. 342.

THE DRUIDS.
'l`he Druids now, while arms are heard no more,
Old mysteries and horrid rites restore;
A tribe who singular religion love,
And haunt the lonely coverts of the grove :
To these, and these of all mankind alone,
'l`he Gods are sure revealed, or sure unknown.
If dying mortals' dooms they sing aright,
Nu ghosts descend to hell in dreadful night;
No parting souls to grisly Pluto go,
Nor seek the dreary, silent shades below:
But forth they By, immortal in their kind,
And other bodies in new worlds they End.
Thus life for ever runs its endless race,
And, like a
line, death but divides the space :
.- stop which can but for a moment Inst,
A point between the future and the past.
Thrice happy they between the northern skies,
Who that worst fate, the fear of death, despise.
Hence they no cares for this frail being feel,
But rush undnunted on the pointed steel ;
Provoke approaching fate, and bravely scorn
'l'o spare that life which must so soon return.

ARGUMENT T0 THE WHOLE WORK.
1-1-1_1
It is the object of the author in the following work, to shew, that the Druids of the
British isles were the priests of a
very ancient nation called Celtm. That these Celtaa
were a
colony from the first race of people,-a leamed and enlightened people, the
descendants of the persons who escaped the eH`ects of the deluge on the borders of the
Caspian Sea. That they were the earliest occupiers of Greece, Italy, Fnance, and
Britain, arriving in those places by a route nearly along the 4-5th parallel of north latitude.
That, in a similar manner, colonies advanced from the same great nation, by a southern
` ` `
th h th
line through Asia, peopling Syria and Africa, and arriving at last, by sea, roug e
illars of Hercules at Britain. In the course of the work, the mode in which the
P s
ancient patriarchal religions, as well as those of Greece and Italy, were founded, will be
`
h tre ed the
pointed out, and the author Batters himself that he shall have muc s
ngthen
foundations of rational Christianity! He will shew, that all the languages of the
western world were the same, and that one
.system of letters, that of the ancient Irish
'
"
'l dGul,totheinhabi-
Druids, pervaded the whole-was common to the British is es an a
mnts of Italy, Greece, Syria, Arabia, Persia, and Hindustan; and that one of the two
habets ofthe some stem) in which the ancient Irish manuscripts are written, namely,
alv ( ry
the Beth-luis-nion, came by Gaul, through Britain, to Ireland; and that the other, the
Bobeloth, came through the Straits of Gibraltar.
°
It must be remembered, that the foundation is the substmction of a building, that upon which it stands, and not
the upper stories or the ornamental parts.
In the following work the author carefully avoids those dgznents which constitute orthodoxies md hsresies, about
hi.s'b ther.
which foolish man, at the instig-ation of the prism, persecute: and murders ro

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS._SECT. I.
IN examining the very early histories of the Western parts of Europe, we
every where
meet with the monum t l =
the ruins of which I speak are of verv great size, and, perhaps, in remote ages, have been
highly ornamented and ot' great magnificence. Numbers of treatises have been written
respecting them and their supposed founders by clilferent persons, each of whom, in
support of his particular system, has made important observations or collected curious
U
en a remains ofa race
ofpersons called DRUIDS. In many places
2 ALPHABETS.-CHAP. I. SECT. II.
original information. But these different works have been much dispersed, and many of'
them are
very dimcult to be obtained.
From a consideration of these circumstances I have been induced to entertain an
opinion, that the subject is by no means exhausted, and that a
general review of the
whole might be interesting to the antiquarian public. I have flattered myself; that I
possess some
advantages which my predecessors have not enjoyed; amongst which, the
opportunity of profiting by their observations is not the least. I have endeavoured to
avoid what I conceive to be their errors; and, particularly, to guard against a too great
pruriency of imagination-an error into which most persons who have a taste for inves»
tigations of' this kind are
apt to fall. It has been my wish to drawa definite line of'
demarkation between facts which I conceive to stand on clear and unquestionable
evidence, and deductions the result merely of theorising speculations-without some
indulgence in which, no
improvement would ever take place, and all inquiries of this
kind must be dull to the very last degree. By these means I have flattered myself with
the hopes of producing a work which may be satisfactory to persons who are above
the vulgar prejudices of` education-persons who will not consider every thing to be
absurd as a matter of' course, merely because to them it is new: but persons who will
try the evidence, by the correct rules of' reason and approved modern criticism.
NECESSITY OF ETYMOLOGYJ-SECT. II.
As proofs of many important circumstances of these people will depend upon ety-
mological researches, I am induced, in the first place, to submit to my reader a few
observations respecting the origin of language. And here, in the very beginning, he
may be inclined to think that I violate the rule I have just alluded to, for the regulation
of my conduct in this discussion; but yet I hope that, by keeping the line between fact
and theory well dedned, he will not have much reason to complain. In order the better
to get to the bottom of my subject, I have found it necessary to make a careful inquiry
into the alphabets of several of the ancient languages, from which it is probable that the
names of places or persons connected with the ancient Druids may have been derived,
and to make a
comparison between them. This has led me to a
speculation respecting
the origin of' written language itselfl It is, indeed, merely a.
speculation; butas it is
only advanced as such, I cannot think that it is an instance of aerial castle-building
which may not be pardoned. Besides, it is closely connected with some reasoning upon
certain facts which will be found quite original; and will be, I flatter myself; conclusive
upon the antiquity of the letters of' the Celtaa and their Druids in these countries. It
seems to be of consequence to establish these facts in the first plate, 29, by that þÿm ¬2¥lS»
I shall be enabled without impropriety to assume rather a
greater latitude in my range of
investigation hereafter.

ALPBABETS.-°SEC'I'. III.
Probably at first the unlearned reader may be a little alarmed at the show of learning
exhibited in the following tables of strange and ugly figures, drawn up in lines and placed
in battle array. But when the first terror has subsided, he will find nothing that is dini-
cult; and which, with mere school-boy learning, he will not easily understand. To
comprehend the reasoning used in the following work, a
knowledge ofthe languages in
the tables of the different alphabets will not be necessary. A very little attention to the
principle upon which I proceed, will enable any person to judge of the probability of
the consequences deduced from the etymologies of the names of places and persons which
are used.
EXPLANATION or 'ras anrnassrs.-sncr. rv.
In the first Table, page 4-, column 1 contains the names of the Samaritan and Hebrew
letters, in the correct order in which it is well known that they were
anciently placed.
Column 2 contains the Samaritan letters. Column 3, the Hebrew or Chaldee letters,
used aher the Babylonish captivity. Column 4- contains the powers qf notation of the
Samaritan, the Chaldee, and the Greek letters. Column 5 contains the Greek letters.
In column 6 the asterisks shew the letters first brought to Greece from Phcenicia, by
Cadmus. Column 7 contains the names of the Greek letters. Column 8 contains the
Celtic Irish letters in English characters,* placed opposite to the letters in the other
alphabets to which they correspond. Column 9 contains the meanings of the Celtic
Irish names of their letters.
In Table II. page 5, No. I, 2, 3 compose the Irish Bobiloth alphabet, with its English
letters and its names copied from Vannnucnv. The P is probably omitted by mistake.
No. 4, 5, 6, compose the Irish Beth-luis-nion alphabet fiom the same author.
No. 7, is an ancient Etruscan alphabet, according to SwrN'roN.
No. 8, is an ancient Etruscan alphabet, according to Gonxus.
No. 9, is one Etruscan alphabet selected ti'om the various ancient Alphabets of Mr.
Asus.
No. 10, is an Irish secret alphabet called Ogham Beth-luis-nion according to Var.-
r.sNc.=:Y.~|-
This was
originally upright, like a tree, in the manner of the present Chinese writing,
but afterwards was used horizontally-and in its master-line it has some
similarity to
the Sanscrit.
No. ll, is another example of an Irish character called a
virgular ogham.
No. 12, is an
example of the characters in the ruins of Persepolis.
No. 18, an
inscription found upon a tomb in Ireland called the Callan Inscrgotion.

CHANGES IN LANGUAGE.1CHAP. I. SECT. Y.
I have no doubt that the Samaritan, the Hebrew, the Greek, and the English alpha.
bets as
they are in the first table, i.e. the I7 primary letters marked with asterisks, are
nearly correct representations of one another, as they were
orzgmal@ without any double
letters. No doubt, in time, the pronunciation would change, as we know it has done; but
generally, for the purpose of etymology, we must go to the fountain-head. This change
may be exemplified in the vowel o, which becameg: as for example, in 'lygw mor,
Senar, it became Singar; 11113 suor, Segar; my oze, Gaze; Him) omre, Gomgrl-ha,
And at last the Masorites have corrupted it into the barbarous nasal G'/1.
It is evident that nothing can have exceeded the carelessness with which the Greeks,
and after them the Modems, have rendered the words and letters ot' one
language into
another. They have had no system ; every thing has been the effect of accident. The
letter ,U o, the sixteenth in the alphabet, following the Nun or the N, and preceding the
Pi or P, and standing in both Greek and Hebrew for the number 70, is often rendered by
the letter A, the first letter, instead of O, the sixteenth. As for instance, njnwp
ostrt, Astarte. Again, hp; boi, Baal. Sometimes by the letter I; as for instance, hgp
abri, Iberi. As we know that this extreme carelessness and total want of system took place
with the Greeks, Latins, and Modems, it may have done the same with the Israelites, the
Phaanicians or the Carthaginians, and this isa possible circumstance which ought always
to be retained in remembrance in our etymologies. Whatever may be thought of
my system, it will have this good effect at least, that the unlearned reader will be enabled
perfectly to understand every etymological deduction which I have drawn. Whenever a
Hebrew word is used, it is followed by the corresponding English letters, as described
in the table, which will enable the unlearned reader always to understand the argument.
Some learned men may perhaps observe that, in my etymologies, I take no notice of
the Masoretic points. It may be proper to say, that I consider them entirely a modern
invention and of no value whatever," except occasionally to shew what the Jews in the
dark ages considered the traditional reading# With one exception,perhaps, they have
been given up by all learned men. A paper, which I published in number LXV. of the
Classical Journal, may be referred to. The reader will there see, that this question was

most elaborately discussed and decided in favour of my doctrine, by Capellus, Elias
Levitta, Thomas Erpenius, Casaubon, Scaliger, Vossius, Drusius, Arnold Boote, Revet,

Sennert, Basnage, Burman, Simon, Limborch, Morinus, Vitringa, Le Clerc, Heuman,
L'Advocat, Houbigant, Bishop Louth, Kennicot, Bishop Marsh, Src., &c.-I therefore
think it unnecessary to add any thing more respecting this matter.
THEORY RESPECTING FIGURES.-SECT. VI.
Before we
proceed farther with our subject, we will now, with the reader's permission,
indulge in a little aerial castle-building, which was before alluded to, which I flatter
myself will not in the end be found to be entirely without its advantages. I have often,
when considering the early history of man, indulged in theories or speculations on the
mode which he probably adopted to acquire a knowledge of the art of reading, writing,
and arithmetic, provided he were not, at the miracle ofthe creation (for it must have been
in the nature of a miracle, and a miracle which no one can
deny) endowed with a know-
ledge of these sciences. Many conclusive reasons, unnecessary to be stated here, might
be given against the latter supposition. This being the case, it follows as a matter of
course, that we must suppose the acquisition of these sciences to have been the result
of his own ingenuity, and of the gradual development of his faculties. And it surely
becomes a matter of great interest and curiosity to ascertain the probable line of conduct
and the gradual steps which he would pursue.
If we suppose that man received no more information at his creation than what was
absolutely necessary for his subsistence, we must allow, that he would be entirely ig-
norant of numbers and letters. It has occurred to me, that the following process might
take place, when he had acquired the art of speaking with a tolerable degree of ease and
fluency. He would very soon begin to count the objects around him, which happened
to interest him most, perhaps his children; and his fingers would be his first reck-
oners: and thus by them he would be led to the decimal calculation, instead of the
more useliil octagonal calculation which he might have adopted-that is, stopping at 8
instead of 10. Thus 8+1, 8+2, 8+S, instead of l0+l or eleven; l0+2 or twelve;
l0+S or thirteen! There is nothing natural in the decimal arithmetic; it is all artificial ;
and I have no doubt it arose from the number of the lingers. I suppose man was created
in or about latitude 4-5, where the land would be properly called, as it is in Genesis, a
paradise, or garden of delight. He would live with ease, with little or no labour; the
iiuits of that climate would supply him with food all the year round. This would con-
tinue for several generations. During this golden age he would consider the objects

around him; and I am of opinion he would begin to count his fingers, and that he would
learn arithmetic, as far at least as to count ten or
twenty. He would take ten little
stones, which we will call calculi,* and he would by putting them into parcels, then di-
viding them, &c., acquire the idea of the ten numbers. He would make them into two
heaps, and see their equality. He would then make them into live heaps and compare them.
Thus he would begin to do what we will call calculate; and when he had seen that the
five heaps of calculi were all equal to one another, he would really have acquired the
idea of what we call calculation. During the time this was
going on, he would observe
the sun and moon. The latter he would observe to increase and decrease; and he would,
after many moons, begin to think it was what we call periodical; and though he had not
the name of period, he would soon have the idea in a doubtful way, and with his cal-
culi he would begin a calculation. He would deposit one
every day for twenty-eight
days, the time that one moon lived; and in a few months' observation he would acquire
a
perfect idea of a period of twenty-eight days, and thus he would be induced to increase
his arithmetic to twenty-eight calculi. He would now
try all kinds of experiments with
these calculi. He would first divide them into two parts of equal number. He would
then divide them again, each into two parts, and he would perceive that the two were
equal, and that the four were
equal, and that the four heaps made up the whole twenty-
eight. He would now certainly discover (if he had not discovered before) the art of
adding, and the art of dividing, in a rude way by means of these calculi-probably with-
out at first giving names to these operations. He would also try to divide one of the
four parcels of calculi, into which the moon's age was divided, still lower. But here for
the first time he would find a.
diliiculty. He would halve them, or divide them into
even parcels, no lower than seven: and here began the first cycle of seven
days, or the
week.
This is not an
arbitrary division, but one
perfectly natural; an eH`ect which must
take place, or follow the process which I have here pointed out, and which appears to
have taken place in every nation that has learned the art of arithmetic. From the utmost
bounds of the East, to the ultima Thule, the septenary cycle may be discovered.~|' By
this time, hundreds of years after his creation, perhaps, man would have learned a little
geometry. From the shell of the egg or the nut, he would have found out how to make

an awkward, ill-formed circle, or to make a line in the and with his finger, which
would meet at both ends. The spider would certainly have taught him how to make
angles, though probably he knew nothing of their properties.
DIVISION OF THE YEAR. AND CIRCLE.1CHAP. I. SECT. VII.
As generations rolled on, man would try many experiments on his circle. He would
divide it into two, then into four; thus he would make radii. Whilst he was
doing this,
le would be in to observe that the sun was like the moon in the circumstance that it
1 S'
was periodical; that it changed continually, and continually returned to what it was
before, producing summer and winter, spring and autumn ; that, after it had blessed him
during a certain time with warmth and comfort and plenty of fruits, it gradually with-
drew; but that in acertain number of days it returned, as the moon had returned, to
what it was before. He would do as he had done with respect to the moon, collect
calculi, and deposit one for every day, and he would find there were three hundred
and sixty days in a period of the sun's revolution. About this time, probably, he
would hit upon the comparison of his period constantly returning into itself with his
circle-the sun's endless period with his endless circle. He would deposit his calculi
about the circumference of his circle. He would divide that, by means of these calculi,
into two parts. He would then halve them cross-ways, thus making four pieces
of circles, each having ninety stones. He would halve the nineties, but he could go
no lower with halving, than making his ninety into two halves ; therefore, after
many experiments, he would divide his ninety into three divisions. Placed in the cir-
cumference of the circle, or into thirties, each thirty again he would divide into three,
and he would find each little division to contain ten calculi, the most important number
in his arithmetic, and the whole number would equal the days of a solar revolution,
three hundred and sixty days. By this time he must have made considerable progress
in arithmetic and geometry. He must have learned the four common rules ofarithmetic,
and how to make a
square, a
right-angled triangle, a correct circle, and perhaps other
useiiil knowledge in those sciences. To all this there is nothing which can be objected,
except it be to the assumption that he would reckon the sun's period at three hundred and
sixty days. But we are justified in assuming this, from the well-known historical Fact,
that the ancients, even within the reach of history, actually believed the year to consist
of only 360 days.° From the circumstances here pointed out, I suppose it to have
happened that the circle became divided into 360 parts or degrees. Philosophers now
began to exercise all their ingenuity on the circle. They first divided it into two or 180
degrees each, then into four or 90 degrees each, then each 90 into three; and they ob-
served that there were in all 12 of these, which were afterward called signs and played

Fmm this sum of 360 several of the mos important cycles were formed.

a very great part indeed. They then divided each of the twelve into three parts, called
decans, and these decans again into two, called dodecans ; then there would be a circle
consisting of 360 degrees,
2 Semicircles of ISO degrees each,
4 Quadrants of 90 degrees each,
12 Signs ot' . . . . 30 degrees each,
36 Decans .... . . I0 degrees each, or 24- parts of 15 degrees each, and each 15 into 3
lives or dodecans, and
72 Dodecans. . . . 5 degrees each.
In a way analogous to this they would probably proceed with the division of the year.
As it consisted of the same number of days as the circle of degrees, they divided it into
12 months ;* these mouths into thirty days each ; and as each day answered to one de-
gree ofthe circle, or to each calculus laid in its circumference, and each degree of the
circle was divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, so in the
same manner they divided the day, which Baillie says was its original division: of
this our 60 minutes and 60 seconds are a remnant. About the time this was going
on, they would find that the moon made 13 lunations in a
year, of 28 days each, instead
of twelve only of 30; from this they would get their lunar year, much nearer the truth
than their solar one. They would have IS months, of four weeks each. They would
also soon discover that the planetary bodies were seven; and they gave one to each of
the days of the week; a practice which we know was universal from the East to the
West all over the world.-A long course of years after this probably passed before they
discovered the great zodiacal or precessional year of 25,920 years; and in analogy to the
preceding division, and for other analogical reasons connected with the solar and lunar
ears named above, they divided it by 60, and thus obtained the number 4-82, the base
Y
of the great Indian cycles. When they had arrived at this, they must have been ex-
tremely leamed, and had probably corrected their early errors, invented the famous
cycles called the Neros, the Savos, the Vans, &c. It is not necessary to pursue this
train ofreasoning filrther at present, but we will resume it by and by.
DBUIDS ACQUAINTED WITH LE'1"1'ERS.='CHAP. I. SECT. VIII.
In an inquiry into the question whether an ancient nation possessed the knowledge of
letters and arithmetic at any certain time, it seems natural in the first place to apply to
the works of contemporary or old authors; and here we shall [ind evidence of this nature
of the most satisfactory kind, which will, I apprehend, terminate all disputes upon this
question as applied to the ancient inhabitants of Gaul and Britain. Caesar is, I think, a
witness in this case, as unexceptionable as it is possible in the nature of things for a wit-
'
What induced the ancient Egyptians and Cbalrleans to throw two signs into one, and thus make only eleven, it is

ness to be ; and he says, speaking of the Druids, the priests of these people, that they
did not think it lawful to commit the secrets of their religion to
writing, although, in the
public and common affairs of life, they used the Greek letters. Neguefas esse exists'-
mant ea literis mandare, guum in religuis _/ere rebus Publicis, privatisgue rationibus
(Grads) literis utuntur! I know not how evidence to a
dry matter of fact can well be
clearer than this. It is evident that Caesar had no
purpose to serve in stating this fact:
it drops from him in the course of his narrative in the most unquestionable manner
imaginable. In some of his observations we shall have reason to make allowance for
individual or national vanity, or anger against his enemies, or a desire to disguise or
palliate his own
cruelty and injustice, but nothing ofthe kind is required here.
In his Commentaries, Caesar says, that he sent a letter to Quintus Cicero, to a distant
part of Gaul, written in the Greek language, in order that if it fell into the hands of the
Gauls they might not understand it. Now this can no other way be made consistent
with the quotation which I have just given than by translating, as I have done, by the
word language, and not letters. Then the case would be precisely like that of a French
general making war in England, and sending home an account written in the English
letters, or the letters common to both nations, but in the French language. The Gauls
and the Greeks used the same, or
nearly the same letters, but the languages were totally
dissimilar.
But there are other passages and circumstances which tend to prove that the Druids
used Greek letters. Cmsar says,T that tables were found in the camp of the Helvetii
written in Greek letters, literis G'»ra:cis corjéctm, which contained a particular census
of the nation of the Helvetii. Now it is very true that the word literis may here mean
the language, but when the meaning of the word literis in other places and all the
other circumstances are considered, it is much more
likely to mean letters and not
language. If it meant letters on{y, it is consistent with the sending of a
dispatch in those
letters by Caesar to Cicero; if it mean
language, the act of Caesar is directly con-
trary to common sense. The conclusion of Mr. Huddleston is quite correct: "
At
any rate this passage is a clear proof that the Celts could read, write, and calculate, for
these registers reach as far as 368,000. If Pinkerton will not allow the Celts an
alphabet of their own, he cannot at least deny that, 1850 years ago, they used the
Greek one."¢ In the former quotation Caesar says, Negue _fas esse ea-istimant ea
liferis mandare. Mr. Huddleston's conclusion from these words of Cmsar's is
equally correct: namely, that they prove that letters were well known: "
for there
can be no law against a
thing unknown."§

19 OBJECTION' T0 THE PASSAGE OF C£SAR'S.-CHAP. I. SECT. IX.
It is said by Strabo* and Caesar, 1' that the latter conversed with Divitiacus by means
of an interpreter. This is perfectly consistent with what has just been said, and sup-
ports it.
Speakin of the Gauls Caesar says, that they had all the same language, with some
8 »
little variation in their dialects. But he says, it was usual with them to pass over to
Britain to improve themselves in the discipline of the Druids, which almost proves that
the two countries had the same language. And Tacitus says expressly, that the language
of Gaul and Britain was not very diH`erent.$
Mr. Huddleston has judiciously observed, that the Turdetani, the oldest inhabitants of
Spain, were Celts; and we are told by Strabo,§ that they had laws written in verse a
thousand years before his time.
Tacitus says || that there were some monuments and sepulchres with Greek inscrip-
7
tions still remaining on the confines of Germany and Rhatla. If there were any such,
they might readily be in the Greek of Cadmus, i. e. the ancient Phoenician, which may
h been l ible, but must have been legible with diiculty in his time. Though the
ave eg
Phoenician and Greek systems of letters were essentially the same, yet in the space of
three or four hundred years they are known to have changed in their forms very much.
osszcrrou 'ro 'rms rassacn or ca-:san's.-crrarnr. sacr. rx.
Speaking of this passage of Cmsar's, Ledwicli says, "The voice of antiquity is silent
as to Druidic letters, which are said to have been used in this isle. Caesar says they
existed, but that passage has been long suspected as the interpolation of Julrus Celsus,
who I believe had Straho in view when he inserted it."
It is true that in the passage of Caasar's which I have quoted, he does not say, that the
D 'ds
`
Britain but no one will entertain a doubt that they
letters were used by the rux an ;
were used in Britain, if they were in use in Gaul. Both countries had been, as Caesar
says, only a little time before under the dominion of the same monarch, Ca:sar's friend
and ally, Divitiacus, who was a chief Druid as well as a sovereign: and, in this respect,
an exact model of Melchizedek. It cannot he denied that Ledwich's inference is hasty
and unihir. If what Caesar says be true, that the Gauls were in the habit of sending
their young people over to the British Druids for instruction, and that the use of letters
f 1 tters
was known in Gaul, nothing can be more absurd than to suppose that the use o e
was unknown in Britain.
Fora long time, I was quite in amazement at the irritation of temper displayed by
various writers when treating of the learning of the ancient Druids. I believe, at last,
the cause of this may be found in a passage of Origerfs against Celsus. Mr. Ledwich says,

"It is above fifteen hundred years ago since Celsus opposed the antiquity of the Druids
and their wisdom to that of the Jews. What was Origen's answer? '
I do not know,' says
the father,
'
that they have left us
any writings! It was incumbent on Celsus then, as on
our Druids now, to support the extraordinary things they have advanced concerning these
sages by other arguments than confident assertions." The argument of Ledwich against
Celsus, to the generality of readers, will no doubt be satisfactory, and probably it was so
to himself: yet perhaps it may be no difficult matter to answer it. The reason
why
Celsus never supported the extraordinary assertion which he made respecting the learning
of the Druids, in answer to Origen, was
merely this; that he was in his grave fifty years
before Origen wrote against him; and that fact various passages in Origen's work prove
that he knew very well.
Celsus had been dilating upon the excellent doctrines as well as the antiquity of the
Druids, and as Origen well knew that Celsus could not answer him, he ought to have
given something more to his reader than merely a bare assertion supported only by the
admission of his own
ignorance, in refutation of his opponent. The real state of the case
seems to be this: Celsus's arguments could not be satisfactorily, or at least were not thought
to be satisfactorily, answered by Origen, and the ignorant priests, always frightened with-
out cause, being alarmed lest Celsus should be thought to have the best of the argument,
have invented the story of the interpolation to assist their friend Origen. There is, I
believe, no variation of manuscripts or
any other cause to justify the idea that the word
Grmcis is an
interpolation. If there had been any doubt upon this point, can it be
believed that Origen would not have known it? And if he had known it, would he not
have instantly noticed it ? It was his best answer to Celsus, if he knew any thing about
the passage in Caesar. But there is no reasn to suppose that the passage in Cesar was
ever in any way brought into question between the disputants. It does not appear to
have been quoted by Celsus, or by Origen, But, merely because it seems to militate
against their system, our priests have thought proper to put it down as an
interpolation.
A few years after, i. e. as soon as the Christian religion became dominant, the works of
Celsus were prohibited under pain of death, and, in consequence, have all long since been
destroyed.
It is not an unimportant fact which we learn from this passage of 0rigen's against
Celsus, that the Druids were not only well known to the Roman philosophers, but that
they were held up by them as examples of wisdom and models for imitation on account of
pre-eminent merit of some kind ; and the answer of Origen, from his guarded manner,
seems to afford reasonable ground of suspicion, that he did know that in their own liar
distant countries the Druids had writings. This is not unfair to suspect of the man who
actually embodied fraud into a
system, practised it with the approbation of his fellows,
and gave it the technical name of Ecosomra, by which it has gone ever since.
(14-l
INGENUITY OF MR. LEDWICH.*CHAP. I. SECT. X.
It is curious to observe the management of Ledwich respecting this passage of Cmsar's
which damns at once all his theory about the ignorance of the Druids. He says he
suspects; then instantly, without any other reason than his own
suspicion, he settles the
matter as an incontrovertible, established fact, and draws conclusions accordingly. The
only reason which those can give who contend for the word Grcecis being an
interpolation
is, that the word is in the text between brackets. They only pretend to have a
su.rp£e:'on
of the single word between the brackets; but Ledwich at once throws in the whole
passage. The word literals, which Casar uses in the other passage about the returns of
Celtic army, raises a strong presumption that he meant what indeed the words strictly
imply. How monstrous is the supposition that Celsus should have flattered himself
that, by a
corruption of one or two copies of Cesar, he should succeed in corrupting all
the copies throughout the Roman empire! It is very probable that every manuscript
of Ca:sar's now
existing has been copied by a Christian priest: and I think no
unpreju.
diced person who has ever studied the history of the monkish ages will hesitate in agree.
ing with me, that it is much more likely that some monk in an
early period, when perhaps
very few manuscripts existed, has inserted the brackets, than that Celsus succeeded in
interpolating the word.
But whether the word Grtecis be an interpolation or not, the passage of Ca:sar's proves
that the Celts had letters, and the story of the lette1°-sending to Cicero proves, that Casar
did not write unadvisedly, but with deliberation and forethought-the result of inquiry.
If the word Graecis be left out, then the passage proves that they had letters; and, if it
be retained, the Greek letters, which must have been originally the same as the Greek
letters brought by Cadmus to Greece before their increase, or that called the Pelasgic.
But there is another strong expression of Ca'esar's which has been pointed out by
Mr. Huddleston. Caesar, assigning the reason why the Druids did not commit their
doctrines to writing, says,*
"
They appear to me to have enacted this law for two
reasons-because they neither wished their doctrines to be made known to the vulgar,
nor their pupils, trusting to the aid of letters, to pay less attention to the cultivation of the
memory." Surely this passage is of itself suihcient to shew, that letters were common
in Gaul, in Ca=:sar's opinion.
The object of Ledwich is, when he has got quit of the word Graacis, to maintain, that
the Druids had no letters, because he thinks his adversaries cannot shew what letters they
were. But this argument the other circumstances of the retums, &c., would overthrow.
I therefore conclude, that the three expressions of Casar's are unquestionable, incontro-
vertible evidence, notwithstanding all which has been insinuated against them.1'

TWO ANCIENT ALP]-IABE'1'S.*CHAP. I. SECT. XI.
Amongst the ancient Greeks and some of the
neighbouring nations, two
very Qld
alphabets appear to have been known. One of these was called the Pelasgic, the Attic,
the Argive, or the Arcadian alphabet. It was
probably the same as the Etruscan, or old
Italian alphabet, which was also called Arcadian, because it was
brought, as it was said,
out oi' Arcadia into Latium, by Evazrnan. Very little is known
respecting these Pe-
lasgi. Their name has been observed to be very like the Hebrew :wha P{gim. Be
that, however, as it may, they seem to have brought their letters with them into Europe:
for Ensrarnrvs, a writer of good credit, in his
commentary on the second Idaal*
assigns it as one reason
why the Pelasgi were called Am, Divi, Divine, because they
alone, of' all the Greeks, preserved the use of letters after the deluge. The other alphabet
is called the Ionian, Phoenician, Cadmean, or JEolian. The Greeks give the conductor of
this colony the name ot' Canmns, and the people Pncenrcuns. The word Cadmus is a
Hebrew word, which means an oriental person. One of the nations of the Canaanites
conquered by Josu ua is called by this name.
These two alphabets appear to have been radically the same, and to have had the same
number of letters. Mr. Davrzs says,
"
They do not seem to have augmented the
number of the letters. Only sixteen are ascribed to Cannws. The same number is
claimed by the old Latins, by the old Germans, by the Irish, and by the British bards."
The Welsh letters are now
thirty-six in number; but the late Dr. Rzcnaans, in his
little treatise edited by Dr. Evans, says, that only sixteen of them are radical, and that
they are almost entirely the same as the Etruscan. I think it must he admitted, that all
those European languages which have sixteen letters, wherever they might come li'om,
had only one common origin.
Dronoaus Srcunus informs us, that Cadmus did not
originally invent, but only
changed the figures of the Ietters.1* Diodorus is a
very respectable historian, and from
this it may be inferred, that the Greeks could read and write before this Cadmus, or this
oriental importation, arrived amongst them.;
Tacu°Us§ says, that Cncnors brought to the Athenians an
alphabet. These letters
must have been more ancient than those of Cadmus; and this alphabet contained the old
Attic letters-A1:l|x& ygaiftpafa -nit Apzaia. It Was in these cllamcters in which was
written the inscription of Megara, the most ancient monument of stone which Pausanias
had seen in Greece, and which was found in the tomb of Coamnus, erected a little a&er
the death of Cecrops."

IRISH, GREEK, AND HEBREW LETTERS THE SAMEJ-CHAP. I. SECT. XII.
Thus we
may consider as
proved, the well-known historical Fact, that the common
letters of the Greeks now in use came originally from the East; that at first they did not
that about the time of the Trojan war four new letters were
added to them by Panamnnss, and afterward four more
by Srmoiunns! lt may be
seen ti-om Table II. (p. 5), that the number of the letters of the ancient Celtic Irish alpha-
bet did not exceed seventeen, and that of those, sixteen were the identical sixteen letters
said to have been brought from Phcenicia, by Cadmus. A very little consideration of
the mble, must convince any one, that the system of letters of the Samaritans, the
Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Irish Celts, must have been originally the same. It is
quite impossible that their extraordinary and close coincidence can have been the effect
of accident. Mr. Huddleston has justly observed, that this coincidence must have arisen
from the original and absolute identity of the alphabets themselves. He asks, If the
Irish had culled or selected their alphabet from that of the Romans, as some persons
have absurdly imagined, how or by what miracle could they have hit on the identical
letters which Cadmus brought from Phcenicia and rejected all the rest? Had they
thrown sixteen dice sixteen times, and turned up the same number every time, it would
not have been so marvellous as this. The identity of the Cadmean and Irish alphabet is
not, therefore, the effect of chance or accident.
Dr. Paasoxs says,
"
It appears that the Irish amanuenses wrote out the Latin
gospels in their own characters, ofwhich I have seen several copies, and finely executed.
However, they were obliged, in writing the Latin language, to take in the secondary
letters, which their own seventeen were not suiiicient for, and which that language could
not do without: and it is very remarkable, that in all the manusmpts qft/ieir own
tongue,
not an additional letter can be pointed out to the primary seventeen. But I find in some
rinted books in that language, for example in Bishop Bnnsrfs Irish Bible and New
P
Testament, the aspirate li is taken in: this has made some modern grammarians count
eighteen letters in the Irish alphabet."
Now this evidence of Dr. Parsons'.is quite conclusive on the subject of the antiquity
of this alphabet: because no one can believe that the Irish would not have taken the whole
alphabet if they had been copying either from modern Greek, Latin, or Hebrew. It
seems to me to confirm the antiquity of the manuscripts in which this limited number is
used. It tends to confirm the authenticity of the manuscripts, and the manuscripts tend
exceed seventeen in number;

to confirm the antiquity of the alphabet. A single glance of the eye to the Ogam, No.
10, (of Table II. p. 5,) is suiiicient, from their different style, to convince any person
which are the new and which the old letters.
Dr. SMITH observes, that "the Greek x expresses a sound so common in the Gaelic,
and so
imperfectly expressed by the combined powers of c
(or lc) and li, that the Irish
could not possibly omit it, if it had been in the alphabet when they had adopted the rest
of their letters. So far would they be from leaving it out, that it is rather a wonder they
never
thought of inventing such a letter, to avoid the necessity of making perpetual sub-
stitutions for it." *
If the Ogam Beth-luis-nion had been a modern fabrication, the meaning of several of
the names of letters, the Pieth-Bhog, Suil, and Teine, for instance, would have been
given, instead of the ignorance of their meaning confessed.'|' Persons contriving the
other, would never have left these a blank: when they were
inventing the one, they would
not have failed to invent the other.
Mr. VALLENCEY has observed, that the profane character of the Druids of Ireland, the
Bobeloth, is very similar to the Punic or Phoenician ;1' and, at the end of his Grammar,
in the eighth table, will be found an alphabet, taken from old Samaritan coins, which is
absolutely identical in the shape of the letters, or as
nearly so as possible, with one of the
Irish alphabets.
SLIGHT nrrrnnzxcn IN 'run Anrnannrs.-cuar. I. SECT.XIII.
No doubt the reader will have observed, that there is a little discrepancy in all this
reasoning between the number of sixteen and seventeen letters, but this slight anomaly
is certainly not enough to affect the general result. It arises from the digamma, which
is yet attended with very considerable diiiiculties, notwithstanding all the leaming and
labour bestowed upon it by BENTLEY, M.uzsH,§ and many of our most learned men;
but, in fact, as the digamma is now acknowledged to have been in the ancient Greek
alphabet, no
discrepancy exists: and it is worthy of observation, that this very circum-
stance tends strongly to confirm the antiquity of the Irish alphabets; for if they had been
of late adoption, but before Mr. PAYNF. KNIGHT proved, that the digamma was an
integral part of the Greek alphabet, sixteen letters only would have been found. The
seventeen letters, one of which' is the digamma, being found in these old alphabets,
which are
evidently the same as the Greek, tends strongly to confirm Mr. Knight's
argument of the antiquity of the digamma. In a curious manner they confirm one
another. It is now clear that, if the Greek had not lost its digamma, it would have had
precisely the seventeen letters of the Irish.

Dr. Snucxronn* has remarked, "that the ancient Hebrews had the same
tongue
and letters or characters with the Canaanites or Phcenicians, as might be evidenced from
the concurrent testimonies of many authors ; nay, all the nations in these parts, Phteni-
cians, Canaanites, Samaritans, and probably the Assyrians, for some years spake and
wrote a1ike."1'
ENGLISH AND ARABIC ALPHABETS THE SAME AS THE 0THERS.-CH. I. SECT. XIV.
On considering the table a little further, it will appear, that our modem English
alphabet is identical with all the others which have just been considered, with such va-
riations only excepted as may be expected to take place in the lapse of many ages. The
g seems to form the only material variation. It may safely be assumed, that no one will
deny the identity of the English with the Greek alphabets. This being granted, its
identity with the Hebrew and Samaritan must also be granted. The fact of the Sama-
ritan, the Greek, and the Hebrew letters all having the same powers of notation, is a
decisive and infallible proof of their identity. From Sir WY Jonesl learn, that all the
Hebrew roots of words are to be found in the Arabic language. This is curious, and
would lead to a suspicion, (in the end we shallfndperhaps more than asuspiciom) that it is
the older of the two. The Arabic alphabet at present consists of twenty-eight letters;
but the Bishop qfSt. David'.s~, in his Arabic Grammar, says, of these seventeen arepri-
mary fgreres; and the powers of notation are
precisely the same as the Hebrew letters,
in the order in which they now stand; as Alif, 1; Beth, 2 ; Gimel, 8, &c. &c.; so that
there can be no doubt of their original identity.
The Persian alphabet is so near the Arabic, that,
"
if the reader afiix three dots to the
sixth letter ofthe Samaritan alphabet, as it still appears in the Samaritan manuscripts of the Pentateuch, is a double
Gamal, as the sixth letter ofthe Greek alphabet was a double Gamma." Hora: Pehsgtbc, P. L eh. ii. p. 50.

The seventeen primary letters ofthe Arabic alphabet, according to Dr. Buncass,

OGAMS OF IRELAND.-CHAP. I. SECT. XV.
In the Table I. No. 10, the reader has seen an
example of one of the Ogam alphabets,
the Beth-luis-nion Ogam of the ancient Irish Druids, in which they had such of their
secret doctrines as they thought proper to commit to
writing. In these letters a well-
known inscription some years ago was found in Ireland, called the Callan Inscription.
A plate of it is given in the Archzeologia Soc. Ant. Land., and it may be seen at the
bottom of the second plate of languages, No. 13, p. 5.
Dr. Anus says, fifteen lines are required to express the first live letters of this alpha-
bet,+ and that this may be translated in five di&`erent ways ; consequently nothing can be
'l'
more uncertain than its true meaning; and nothing could have been better contrived for
the purpose of concealing the true meaning of its contents from the vulgar eye. Besides,
it is probable that, like the modern cells of the Inquisition under the Carthusian Convent
at Baden, it may have been contrived to conceal the secrets of the priests from the kings,
rsons of authority as well as from the mere vulgar. It might have been made to
or pe ,
contain two distinct histories, one for the priests, and one for the kings, if they should have
insisted on being instructed farther than the priests thought proper to trust them.
It cannot be doubted that the Ogams are the effect of regular, preconcerted design and
invented system, and not of accident or circumstance. They are the same in this respect
'th the Sanscrit It is the contrary with all other alphabets, which are all the chil-
wi .
dren of circumstance, and have assumed their present shapes or forms by slow degrees.

These Ogams are
evidently contrived for secrecy.§ Of course it would only be turn

HERCULES OGMIUS.-'CHAP. I. SECT. XVI.
There is a
story told by LUCIAN, and cited by Mr. TOLAND, which is very curious,
He relates that, in Gaul, he saw HERCULES represented as a little old man, whom in
the language of the country they called Oamws, drawing after him an infinite multi-
tude of persons, who seemed most willing to follow, though dragged by extremely line
and almost imperceptible chains, which were fastened at one end to their ears, and held
at the other, not in either of Hercules's hands, which were both otherwise employed, but
tied to the tip of his tongue, in which there was a hole on
purpose, where all those chains
centred. Lucian, wondering at this manner of portraying Hercules, was informed by
a learned Druid who stood by, that Hercules did not in Gaul, as in Greece, betoken
strength of body, but the force of eloquence; which is there very beautifully displayed by
the Druid, in his explication of the picture that hung in the temple. The expression
used by Lucian is Tov 'Egaxma 51 Kskroc OFMION ouopafourz ¢mvy| 171 tvrlxwpup. Here
Lucian positively asserts that Ogmius was a Gallic word, a word of the country, nrixmgup.
It is indeed pure Celtic, and signifies, to use the phrase of Tacitus about the Germans, the
secret of letters, particularly the letters themselves, and, consequently, the learning that
depends on them, from whence the force of eloquence proceeds: so mat Hercules Ogmius
is the learned Hercules, or Ifercules the Protector of Learning, having by many been
reputed himself a
philosopher.
"
To prove this account of the word," (Mr. Toland con-
tinues,)
"
so natural and so apt, be pleased to understand, that from the very beginning
of the colony, Ogum, sometimes written Ogam, and also Ogrna, has signified in Ireland,
the secret of letters, or the Irish alphabet: for the truth of which I appeal to all the Irish
books, without a
single exception. It is one ofthe most authentic words of the language,
and originally stands for this notion alone."-Surely, after this, the origin of the Hercules
Ogmius can be no
longer a matter of doubt. Mr. Toland goes on to observe, with re-
spect to the letters, that "
after the Christians had introduced the Roman, those of the
natives soon became obsolete and only understood by antiquaries; whence it happened,
that Ogum, from signifying the secret
qfwriting, came to signify secret
writing, but still
principally meaning the original Irish characters."-In this I differ from Mr. Toland.
I believe one of the Og-ums was the original, secret and sacred character of the Druids,
and what Cmsar called the Greek was the common letter-either the Cadmean or the
above the line. Now, if this alphabet had not been bonowed at least before thetime of the Trojan war, when
Palamedes made the first addition to it, we can
hardlyconceive it should be so simple."
The Boustropliedon style of writing is said to have been disused by the Greeks about 460 years A. C. But it is a
curious fact, that it continued in use
amongst the Irish to a much later period. As'rLE's Or-:yin and Progress qf

Ionian seventeen letters before they lost the digamma-both in fact nearly the same,
having been derived from a common source.
After the introduction of Christianity, the Ogam writings, not
being understood by the
priests, were believed to be magical, and were
destroyed wherever they were found,
Parnrcx is said to have burnt three hundred books in these letters. If Patrick never
lived, there can be no doubt that those who ascribe the act to him as~a merit, would do it
for him.
"
The word Ogam or Ogum is preserved in the Welsh, where Ogan is augur-y, divina-
tion. Kavznsn also tells us, that Oga, Ogum, and Ogma, are old Celtic words, imply-
ing letters written in cipher, and indirectly an occult science." Rune had the same
meaning as Ogum, and meant secret or mystery. It succeeded the word Ogumsf
OGAM WBITINGS YET EXIST._'CHAP- I. SECT. XVII.
Mr. Toland has observed, that there are various manuscript treatises extant, describing
and teaching the different methods of this secret writing; one in the college library at
Dublin, and another in that of his Grace the Duke of Chandos. And DUDLEY Fonass
had some of the primitive birch tables on which their works were written, in the year
1688, besides many sorts of the old occult writing. These were the Ogham-beith, the
Ogham-coll, and the Ogham-craoth, which means
Ogum-branches;
Foncuznu, a noted bard and philosopher, who lived a little before CHnrsr, ascrib-
ing, with others, the invention of letters to the Phcenicians, or rather more
strictly and
properly to Phoenix, whom the Irish call Fenius Farsaidh, or P/las-nie' the Ancient, 'says,
among other alpbabets, as the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, he also composed that of Berh-
luisnion an 0ghum,§ the alphabet of Ogum, or the Irish alphabet, meaning, that he
invented the first letters, in imitation of which the alphabets of those nations were made.
Ogum is also taken in this sense by the best modern writers: WILLIAM O'DoNNaL1.,
allzerward Archbishop of Tuam, in his preface to the Irish New Testament, dedicated to
King JAMES 'run Frnsr, and printed at Dublin, in the year 1602, speaking of one of his
assistants, says, that he enjoined him to write the other part according to the Ogum and
propriety of the Irish tongue; where Ogum must necessarily signify the alphabet, ortho-
graphy, and true manner of writing Irish. [I

seventeen letters? This latter may well have been the character in which the Druids
concealed and wrote their secrets, such of them as
they did write, for most of them were
preserved by memory. Mr. Ledwich has justly observed, that something similar may be
found in the ancient Latin sigla, or
tyronean notes improved or increased by ENNIUS,
Ssxzcs, &c., which may be seen at the end of Gnu'rEn's inscriptions.
Mr. Ledwich may make himselfas angry as he pleases, and he may scoi at and ridi-
cule his contemporaries as much as he pleases, but he cannot shew that the Ogum Beth-
luisnion was not invented at some time by somebody; and why should not the Druids
have invented it? I think from a consideration of the various circumstances, that the
Greek letters which were first brought from Phmnicia to Greece were those of the Druids,
and that it is possible they were the inventors of the Ogham Bethluisnion for the conceal-
ment of their doctrines, when the Phcenician Greek letters used by them had not yet
been increased to more than seventeen in number. The fact of Hercules being called
Ogmius we know from the Greek authors: and the circumstance of the old Irish histo-
rians saying, that he had the name
Ogmius because he was the inventor of the Ogham,
seems to tally very well with the supposed antiquity of that secret, and evidently artifi-
cial, system of letters.
'
Mr. INNES observes, that the Bethluisnion cannot be ancient because it has twenty-two
letters and diphthongs. I do not pretend to say which ofthe Ogums was the ancient one.
If it were the Bethluisnion, it must have been increased, a thing likely enough to have
happened. Innes says, the genuine Irish alphabet consisted of only eighteen 1etters.°
This is enough for me. I think the Bethluisnion was the ancient one.
AFFINITY BETWEEN THE LANGUAGES.-CHAP. I. SECT. XVIII.
The amnity between the Greek, the Roman, and the Celtic languages, observed by
Mr. Huddleston, is perfectly consistent, as will be hereafter explained, with an idea which
Ientertain, that a
regular stream of emigration flowed from some
great nation in the
East to the West, irrigating, if I may use the expression, with small streamlets, the
countries at the side of its course. Thus a branch was detached into Greece, where it
founded the Oracle of Delphi,-|' said by Pausanias to have been founded by the Hyper-
borean Ollen.;
The Celtic language is now almost extinct in Gaul, ertcept only in Lower Brittany,
and such Gallic words as remain scattered among the French. It subsists, however,

entire in the several dialects of the Celtic colonies, that is, the British, Welsh, Cornish,
Irish, Manks, and Earse; as do the words Ogum and Ogma, particularly in Irish!
The following alphabets are derived from the Phcenician according to Mr. Astle, viz.
the Hebrew or Samaritan, the Chaldaic, the Bastulan,1' the Punic Carthaginian, or
Sicilian, the Pelasgian Greek.
If what Gonrus and SwrN'roN say can be depended on, that the ancient Etruscan
alphabet had only thirteen letters, it seems fair to conclude, that the Etruscans were settled
in Italy, or that they had letters, before any of those nations which are found to have
had sixteen or seventeen. It will then follow, according to the present hypothesis, that
the Eastern nation from whom they came had at iirst only thirteen; that after the Etrus-
can colony came to Italy the Cadmean or Eastern nation or Celttr, Kea-roi, increased
their letters to seventeen. It is probable that the nation amongst whom the fewest and
most simple letters are found will he the oldest. On this principle, the Etruscans, being
a colony, must have come direct from the oldest nation.
ARGUBIENT CONCLUDED._-CHAP. I. SECT. XIX.
If I am asked to state, in one word, what I conceive to be the fact with respect to the
Irish and British letters and language, I reply, The language was one of the five dialects-
the Welsh, the Cornish, the Irish, the Manks, or the Earse, or some language new lost,
the direct mother qf them all. The system of letters which they used was the same
system and derived from the same source as the two alphabets of seventeen letters brought
into Greece, called the Cadmean and Ionian,-for the system was
evidently the same in
these two: and their common letters were the Greek Ionian, with some
trifling variation
arising from circumstances of change of place and length of time, as usually happens.
For their secret doctrines and correspondence they may have invented one of the Ogums,
(unless, indeed, the Ogham were the first invention,) which would of course
originally
consist of only seventeen letters, though probably when the secret became known, and the
practice commonly used, after the time of Cmsar, it was increased in the number ot
letters, and dipthongs were added. It may as well be argued, that the Greek letters are
not ancient because there are at this time more than twenty of them, as, that the
Beth-luis-nion is not ancient because some writings are now found in it with more than
twenty letters. This will prove that particular writing not ancient; but it proves
nothing for the letter. The letters were probably increased as those of the Greeks were.
It is enough that Mr. Innes, the great opponent of the antiquity of the Irish, allows, that
some one of them had only eighteen letters originally.

PECULIARITY OF THE IRISH ALPHABET.-CHAP. I. SECT. XX.
I must now draw the attention of my reader to certain very extraordinary peculiarities
of the Irish alphabet, from which I consider that important conclusions may be deduced.
The alphabet of' the Irish appears not to have been arranged in the same order as that of
the Greek or the Hebrew. Which may have been the original, it may now, probably, be
impossible to determine. Some ofthe Psalms being written acrostical{y, may be suliicient
to prove that the present arrangement of the Hebrew is older than the Greek-but it
proves nothing for the Irish, because the Irish must be of a date long prior to any of the
Psalms of David. The Irish alphabet is called Beth-luis-nion from the names of' the
three first letters, Bet/a the Birch, Luis the Quicken, and Nion the Ash. The Irish
works which last remained were written on the barks of trees called Oraium, or on
smooth tables of' birch-wood, which were called Taib/ile Fileadh, which Mr. Toland
translates poets' tables! Their characters were called twigs and branch-letters, as Mr.
Toland says, from their shape. Feadha: Craobln Og/um. Faidii is the Celtic word for
prophet in the Irish books, particularly in the Bible. From the word Faidlz came the
Latin word votes or wait, by the usual conversion of the letters F into V, and D into T;
and from the same Celtic original came the Greek ova-mg. The Hebrew gramrnarians
would say that, in the expression Taibhle Fileadh, the word Taibhle is correctly in regi-
mine, i. e. a peculiar formation ofthe Hebrew language.
A careful examination of the several letters of the alphabets in the first table, (p. 4-,) and
a
comparison of' them one with another, will probably satisfy any unprejudiced reader,
that the Irish, the Greek, the Hebrew, and the Samaritan alphahets have all been called
after English trees, or the English trees after them. But first it may be proper to observe,
that great allowance ought to be made for the change necessarily arising from the lapse
of several, perhaps almost many, thousand years. It is absolutely impossible to doubt
the original identity of the Samaritan, the Greek, and the Hebrew letters; and how
wonderfiilly are they changed! Then, if we do not find the English names of trees
differ more fmm the Irish names, and the names of the Greek, Hebrew, and Samaritan
letters, than the alphabets differ from each other, we shall have a similarity as great,
perhaps greater than could be expected. It is not at all probable, that the similarity
should continue to this time in all the letters; very few will be sufiicient to establish the
fact, if they only possess a suicient degree of' similiarity.

IRISH LETTERS comunnn WITH HEBREW.1CHAP. r. sEc'r. XXI.
The Aleph, Alpha, and Ailm, are not
strikingly similar, but there is a
very obvious
resemblance between the words Ailm and Elm : the first letter of the word Ailm being
pronounced as we
pronounce the A in our A, B, C, or in the word Able.'*
The Beth or Beith of the Samaritan and Hebrew is the identical Beth or Beith, the
Birch-tree of the Irish. 1'
In the next three names of letters, the similarity is lost, except that they begin with
the same letters.
The Digamma forms an
exception to all rules.
The Jod or Iod or Iot-a, and Iodha and Yew, are all clearly the same, or as near as
can be expected. This will be immediately found on
pronouncing the I in the word
Yew by itself; instantly followed by the other letters.
In the Letters of Ancrrnrsaor Usrrna, No. 81, it is stated by a Mr. Davis, who was
employed by the Bishop to procure manuscripts for him in the East, that he learned from
the Samaritans, that their nation pronounced the word Jehovah YE!-IUEH, in Hebrew
mn# Ieue. This must be y, as i in pine ; e, as a in ale ; hu, as hu in Hume, or as u in
use.
Any person conversant with the French and Italian languages knows, that the i in
them is generally pronounced as the English e in queen, as ravine, but that in our
language it is mostly pronounced as in the word pine. This is probably a remnant of
our Asiatic original language, which we have kept in consequence of our secluded situa-
tion. It is the same sound as the Y or I in the word mm Ieue.
Perhaps it may be thought &u=fetched, hut, may not the name of the Yew, the very
name of the Gov Jnnovan, have been given it from its supposed almost eternity of
life? It is generally believed to be the longest lived tree in the world. If this were
the case, when a
person spoke ofthe Yew-tree, it would be nearly the same as to say the
Lord's tree.
There is nothing more very striking till we come to the Mem, Mu, Muin, vine. The
vine may have very readily come from the word Muin; the letter m being dropped for
some unknown cause, or the m
may have been prefixed to the Vin.
The Nun is the Nu and Nuin without diiiiculty, though it has no relation to the Ash
in sound or letter. Yet the Nun of the Hebrew is evidently the same as the Irish tree
Nuin.
The Oin and the Irish Oir have a
similarity, but have no relation to the Spindle or the
Oir, except in the first letter ofthe latter.

26 POSSIBLE USE OF THE ABOVE SYSTEM.-CHAP. I. SECT. XXII.
The Samaritan and Hebrew Resh is the Irish Ruis.
The Shin and Tau are only similar in iirst letters to the Suil and Tein.
The similarity, it is true, is not found in many of the sixteen letters; but there is
sufhcient to prove that the Irish have not merely culled letters out of the Roman alpha-
bet and given them the names of trees; for, although the examples of similarities are now
become oddly and unsystematically arranged, yet their present situation can have arisen
from nothing but an original identity, destroyed by various accidents. If the Ailm
have nothing to do with the Aleph, it is evidently the same as the English Elm; and if
the Beth or Beith have little or nothing to do with the English Birch, it is evidently iden-
tical with the Hebrew Beth. How comes the Irish tree to bear the name of a Hebrew
letter? Thus, again, the Jod or Iod, Iota, Iodha, and Yew, are all nearly allied, and
the Iod and Iodha identical. Again, how comes this Irish name of a tree and a letter
of their alphabet to be the same as the Hebrew name of this letter? Can any one look
at the Greek Mu, the Irish Muin, and the English Vine, and not be convinced, (all the
other letters and circumstances considered,) that they are the same? It is evidently the
three last letters ofthe Irish Muin,
The Irish name of the Ash, Nuin, is the same as the Hebrew and Samaritan Nun and
the Greek Nu.
Lastly, the Samaritan and Hebrew Resh is unquestionably the Irish Ruis, the Elder.
Again I ask, how come these Hebrew letters to bear the names of Irish trees? Several
thousand years ago did the Irish literati understand Hebrew, and call their trees after
Hebrew and Samaritan letters on purpose to puzzle the learned men of the present day?
There is no way of accounting for these extraordinary coincidences and circumstances,
except by supposing an original alphabet called after trees, and changed by accident
in long periods of time.
~
POSSIBLE USE OF THE ABOVE SYSTEM.-CRAP. I. SECT. XXII.
The application of the names of trees to letters, or of letters to trees, practised by the
ancient Irish, is perfectly original, and may give rise to very curious and important
observations. This practice cannot be attributed to circumstance or accident.
Of the time when the Irish system was invented, it is unnecessary to hazard an
opinion; but it is so similar to the Hebrew, the Greek, and the English, that it must be
allowed to have come from the same source.
The circumstance_of the letters bearing the names of trees may have been made very
conducive to the purposes of mystery and secresy. A letter could be sent by means of
the leaves of trees strung on a cord, in the reading of which there would be little more
diliiculty than in reading the Greek in the ancient uncial letters, which are all written
like one word, or the Hebrew in a
synagogue copy: and if a messenger were detected
HIEROGLYPHICS.-CHAP. I. SECT. XXIII. 27
with the letter upon him, what, without the key, could be made of' a
string of leaves?
The mystification might be made more complete by intermixing the leaves of other
trees: and this would not have increased the diiliculty of reading to those persons in the
secret.
The name of the Vine given to one of the letters seems to shew that this is neither
an invention of Britain nor India, for though this plant grows in both, it is common in
neither ; but it is indigenous in the latitudes 40 and 4-5.
Suppose the leaves to have been strung on a cord of linen, which all the most ancient
mummies shew us was in common use in the earliest times; that they were made of
thin lamina of gold-something like the triposes of the ancient Peruvians, or of tin;
that the leaf letters were seventeen in number; then, by adding the leaves of other trees
not in the alphabet, it is evident that the difficulty of deciphering the letter would be
greatly increased to all except those in the secret. And if the extra leaves were placed
between the words, they would serve as assistants to the initiated, in the same
way
as the breaks in our writing between our words, at the same time that they increased the
difficulty to the uninitiated. After some time it would be found, that by writing the
names ofthe letters on skins or tablets, or
by drawing their shapes or pictures, the same
effect would be produced. Thus hieroglyphics would be used, which could never be
deciphered without the key, as the figures between the real letters might be increased ad
libitum ; and yet they might be deciphered by the initiated with the greatest ease; the
interposed letters, however numerous, serving as assistants to the initiated, to terminate
each word, like the vacant spac in our
reading, or the final letters of the Hebrews.
HIEROGLYPHICS.--CHAP. I. SECT. XXIII.
If this principle be applied to the pictures or names of other objects, to be interposed
between the letters as well as leaves of trees, a mode will be exhibited by which a more
complicated kind of hieroglyphics may have been invented, and the reason will be seen
why it is probable that they never can be deciphered. If hieroglyphics had preceded
the invention of letters, when letters were invented they would have been laid aside.
But it is certain that they were in use long after the invention of writing. This could
be for nothing but secresy.
If it were to be admitted that an intercourse anciently existed between India,
Persia, and Britain, it could have been conducted by the chiefs of the Bramins, the
Magi, and the Druids, unknown to the remainder of mankind, by means of these myste-
rious leaves. They might be made of gold or tin, and pass for talismans, to protect the
bearer from dangers of various kinds, which were things in common use as far back as
we have either record or tradition.
It is very certain either that the letters must have been called aher the trees, or the
d 2
28 CIPHERING INVENTED BEFORE LETTERS.-'CHAP. I. SECT. XXIV.
trees after the letters. The former will be generally admitted to be the most probable.
But if the reader will look to the words which form the names of the Hebrew letters and
the Irish trees, and consider them carefully, he will probably perceive a curious and
striking similarity. The Aleph or Alpha is something like the name of the Irish tree
Ailm and the English Elm. The Irish, Greek, and Hebrew, all begin with same letter,
A ; the Beith or Beth of the Irish is evidently the Beth of the Hebrew and the Beta of
the Greeks; and here again all the languages begin with the same letter of the alphabet.
By thus going through the sixteen letters, the total of trifling likenesses or coincidences
makes, upon the whole, a strong similarity; and, to an etymologist, in some cases an
actual identity. For instance, Jod, Ioda; Mem, Muin; Nun, Nuin, Src.
But though the Mem or Muin and the Beith are the Irish names of trees, they are not
the Hebrew names of trees. It is impossible to believe that the Asiatics by accident
called their sixteen letters after the Irish names of trees. From these observations it is
pretty clear that the Greek and Hebrew letters have been originally called alter the Beth-
luis-nion ofthe Irish, or after some language whence it was taken.
CIPHERING INVENTED .BEFORE LETTERS.-CHAP. I. SECT. XXIY»
From the train of reasoning in Sect. VI., the reader will perceive that it is the author's
opinion, that the art of ciphering took precedence of the art of reading or writing. The
figures would evidently be the first of the two wanted; and probably when they were
invented, names of trees were given to them. The Mexicans had the knowledge of
figures, the decimal calculation, but not of letters; the natives of Otaheite the same.'
From the use of the first ten or fifteen figures for numbers of the calculi, a transition to
letters would not be very diilicult, and probably took place, and gave them their names of
leaves; and what was to prevent this early practice from being continued in the seques-
tered nook of the Ultima Thule called Ireland, to which its Magi or Druids retreated
from the world? It has been more exempt hom foreign rule than almost any other
nation in the universe. Why may it not have retained this remnant of primeval leam-
ing as well as
many other customs, as will hereaher be shewn? The substitution of the
refined Sanscrit will account for all traces of it being lost in India.
From the use of leaves, the transition to hieroglyphical writing would be very easy.
It offers itself so evidently, as hardly to be avoided. The drawing of the diferent leaves
would form the first letters; the drawings of other objects would speedily follow. Much
has been said respecting the Mexican picture-writing, by the messengers sent to Costas.
This had no resemblance either in substance or shadow to hieroglyphics. They painted
°As'n.n,p.l82.
.4 nnzv C0NCERN.1CHAP. 1. sncr. xxv. 29
the horses, ships, &:c., because they had never seen such things before, and their language
ofcourse could convey no idea of them. But this was
nothing like
hieroglyphics.
The intention of the ancient hier-og{yy/lic was to enable one person to
convey to
another infomation relating to some
thing already known to both, and of which, there-
tbre, they mutually possessed an idea; but the piclures qfMe.rico were intended, by the
persons drawing them, to
convey a new idea respecting something wholly unknown
to the beholder, and of which he had consequently never formed an idea before.
All this will be thought very wild, because it is quite new. At all events it is very
curious, and perhaps, like many other things, at a future day, when prejudice abates, it
may be better thought oil Bacon and Woaczsrnn were
laughed at, and so has the

HOLY FURY.--CHAP. I. SECT. XXVI. 31
Here the reader will hardly fail to find the leaves of the Druids of Ireland-the 0;-a¢1e
delivered on the leaves of trees. And Virgil did wisely to make his hero prevail on the
Celtic priestess of Cimmerian Cuma to waive the ceremony of writing them, and to give
him his instructions viva voce; for, if the leaves had been used, probably whether dig.
persed or not, neither the hero nor the poet would have understood a word of them. In
the time of Virgil, the origin of the custom, the mystery, was
probably unknown even to
the initiated. The treatises of Cicero and other Romans prove, that the real meaning of
the ancient mysteries was as little known to them as
they are at this time to us. To
the devotees, the priests gave something-probably nonsensical enough; the ancient
mystery was lost, but the priest would not confess his ignorance.
The use of these leaves in oracles would evidently be very favourable to the chicanery
necessary in these places; they would also, from their uncommon and mysterious nature,
be calculated to excite wonder in the ignorant vulgar, and would be easily understood
by the priests of any country who were initiated in the secred mysteries of Apollo, or
the god in whose temples they were used.
HOLY FURY.-CHAP. I. SECT. XXVI.
Although it was the custom for the priestesses to aB`ect a
holy fury, a
species of tem-
porary insanity, in the delivering of their oracles, yet it was also the custom to write them
on the leaves of trees, and to deposit them at the entrances of their caves, or the adyta of
their temples; and it was the object of the devotee to secure them before they were
dispersed by the winds; and of course the priestesses would generally take care that there
should be a little dispersion, that there might be room for a little doubt. When the
practice of writing and depositing the response at the door was
adopted, there does not
seem to have been much room for a display of holy firry.-Whence comes the name of
leaves which we apply to our books-the leaves of our books? The bark of the Pa-
pyrus had no leaves; the rolls of vellum or parchment had no leaves; the tablets had no
leaves. Whence can they have come, but from these magical and horrific priestesses ?
No wonder that governments and priests should have always feared books. They
must necessarily partake of the magical nature of their original!

instructions on the leaves of trees; if his mother had only given him a branch of her

VIRGIL A DBUID.1CHAP. I. SECT. XXVII.
Mr. Davxns observes, that when Homer sends Ulysses to consult the dead, he directs
him to the coast of the Westem Ocean-to Portugal or Spain-to the land of the Cim-
merii or Celtaa, and the donrinions of Pluto or Dis, whom the Celtm acknowledged as
their father; and that in this devious course the poet must have been guided by ancient
and prevailing opinion: that the descent of 1Eneas into the regions below, in which he
learns the mysteries of the metempsychosis, the fortunes, the changes, the renovations ot
his descendants, doctrines of pure Druidism, is fiom a
partof Italy in which not only
the researches ofStrabo, but perhaps Virgil himself; placed one branch of the Cimmerii :
and he neatly observes, that this great bard was born in Cis-Alpine Gaul, and seems in
his youth to have courted the Gaulish muse, till he found that she would not advance
his fortune-a very unpoetical ground ofdesertion.
Galatea rsliqnits

`
It has not been observed to my knowledge, that, in fact, Virgil was a Celtic bard or
poet, as is evident from his expression in the quotation which I have just given; and
that, in his youth, he had studied the Celtic poetry. Mantua, his native town, was
situate in Cis-Alpine Gaul. This not only accounts for his allusion to Druidical
doctrines, but it gives a
degree of authority to what he says, which he would not other-
wise possess. Dryden has noticed that he was consulted by Octavzus as an
astrologer.
This almost makes a Druid of him.
He was born amongst the Druids, and died within a mile of the cave of the Sybil at
Cumaa, where I have myself visited his tomb.

4-. Each of these letters received its name from some tree or plant of a certain species,
regarded as being, in some view or other, descriptive of its power; and these names are
still retained.
So Far the doctrine of the British Druids is exactly recognised in the Western island.
The same identical system is completely ascertained and preserved. Yet there are cir-
cumstances which point out a
very ancient and remote period for the separation of these
il habets lrom each other *
Mr. Davies then observes, that amongst other things the
1 p
-
order of the letters is different. He says there are three kinds of writing, and adds,
~'
The third, which is said to be (no doubt) the remains of an old magma! alph t, is
called Beth-/uis-nion na Ogma, or the alphabet of magical or
mysterious letters, the first
three of which are Beth, Luis, Nion, whence it is. named."1'
Mr Davies is of opinion that the Orpheans were Druids; and observes, if they were
not, nobody knows what they were. The dance of trees to the Orphean harp may have
been an
allegory of the same nature as the Welsh poem of Talzesm, called the Battle
ot' the Trees.
The voyage of Ulysses to the land of the Cimmerii, the descent of JEneas, the branch
of misletoe which is his talisman, the doctrine of metempsychosis which is explained to
him, and the allegory involved in the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, are some of the
reasons which induce Mr. Davies to think that the Druids were the wise men of the
West, from the first peopling of that continent.I
Strabo says, that in an isle near to Britain, the worship of Ceres and Proserpine was
celebrated with the same rites as in Samothrace.§ This could be no where but in
Ireland.
nunzs or 'run NORTH.-SECT.XXlX.
The Runes of the northern nations were the same as, or else the olfspring ol, the secret
alphabets of the Druids, Their general name is Run. This term is traced by Sir H.
SPELMAN, as well as
by other learned men, to the Saxon Ryne, which imports a
mystery
or hidden thing. The Celtae call their system of symbols Run, or Rhin, which in the
Irish and Welsh lammages have precisely the same import. By this it IS not meant
to maintain that the rrorthem runes came from the Druids of the British isles; but from
the identity of the general name, by which the Celtic and Runic letters are distinguished,
i' om the identity of the radical number in both (seventeen), and the general agreement of
r
their powers; from the identity of the uses to which they were applied, the similarity of

both nlphabets were shoots of the same stock, or
sprung from the same root, or de-
vised upon the same plan or system.*
ALLUSIONS ABOUT TREES.-CHAP. I. SECT. XXX.
Taliesin, a Welsh bard of the sixth century, has written a
poem on the Battle of the
Trees, which is yet in existence, and in which he likens the words in the Ogham, or
secret letters of the Welsh, to twigs or branches of trees. Mr. Davies seems to think
that this is an allusion to the original system.'|'
It is mentioned by Apollonius Rhoclius, that when Orpheus played upon the lyre,
the trees of Pieria came down fiom the hills to the Thracian coast, and ranged them-
selves in due order at Zona.; As the people of whom he was, treating worshiped
the sun, whom they styled Zon, there were in consequence of it many places which they
occupied called Zona. One of these we find was in Thmce, near the Hebrus. The term
Zon, the Sun, was oftentimes varied to Zan, Zaon, and Zoan.§
It is agreed by all authors that the Druids pretended to perform various operations by
means of sticks, sprigs, or branches of trees, which are commonly called magical. Some
account of this may be seen in Tacitus de Moribus Germanorum. But, in fact, all the old
native authors are full of these accounts: and it is impossible to read or consider them
for a moment, without seeing the extraordinary similarity of the practice to that of Jacoli
with respect to the sheep of Laban, described in Genesis xxx. 37-
The letters of these magical alphabets, all which answered to the leaves of trees, were
engraved upon the surface of the sticks, cut square, or
trianular, to which the straight
and simple form of the letters was
peculiarly favourable. Hence the letters and the
alphabets came to be considered magical. Hence the whole system of writing was
compared to a tree, with its stem bearing leaves and producing fruits.
Mons. Gebelin|| says, that the primitive alphabets consisted of only sixteen letters:
and a leamed Spaniard has endeavoured to shew, that the pure Phcenician alphabet con-
sisted but of thirteen: and he adds, that the Carthaginian, or Sicilian Phoenician, and
the Basque, or Spanish Phmnician, alphabets, were the same. Dr. Swinton says the

at different times, he will easily be able to select in each
language an
alphabet of sixteen
letters, having that peculiar quality of the Irish Ogham, viz.
consisting entirely of right
lines in angles to one another, so that they may be easily cut on a stick with a
pen-knife,
or scraped out with any pointed instrument. No. 9, in Table II., is an
example s¢1¢¢¢¢d
from Mr. AstIe's tables. No. 7 is an ancient Etruscan alphabet, where there are almost
nothing but right lines at dilferent angles.
Mr. Davies has observed, that the order of the Ionian alphabet accords much better
with that of the Hebrew and of the Western Asiatic in general, than Runic, Irish, or
Bardic; which latter, in all other respects, appears to have been a
very near
ally to the
Pelasgian or Etruscan! This seems to support the theories of Col. Vallencey respecting
colonies of Etruscans coming to these islands.
The writings at Persepolis bear a
strong resemblance to the Irish Ogham.'|' Mr.
Weston, (a gentleman in Arc/i. Soc. Ant. Lon., Vol. XIV. p. 24-7, says,)
"
the word Again
or
Ogam, for they are the same in Sancreet, is mysterious, according to Sir W. Jones."
When I consider the circumstances of the virgular alphabets of the Druids, the similar
angular letters of the oldest of the Gentile nations, and compare them with various pas-
sages of the ancient classical writers, I cannot help suspecting that these Ogham cha.
racters were the first-invented letters. The Rev. Mr. Davies says,
"
The ancient me-
thod of using letters in Greece and Italy seems to have been, by cutting them across
laths, or splinters of wood, like the inscribed sticks of Ezekiel, and the peithynen
of British bards."
Pliny says,
"
Table books of wood were in use bei`ore'the time-of Homer ;" and refers
us for proof to the following words, in the Iliad, conceming Bellerophon:
-*Ihre 5' iv' wwe Uwe.

"
i-
the devoted youth he sent,
With tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent."
Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius inform us, that the laws of Solon were inscribed on
tables of wood; and A. Gellins says of them,-In legibus Solonis, illis antiquissimis,
quae Athenis, axibus ligneis incisae erant.1
In consequence of authors not knowing any thing of the system or
practice of en-
graving letters on staves, or the stems or stalks of trees squared, they have been induced
to construe the above words of Gellius, when describing the laws of Solon as
being
engraved ligneis axibus, by the words table or board. The words will bear no such
construction. They evidently refer to the Druidical mode of writing, and to
nothing
else; and they prove, as
clearly as words can prove, that in the time of Solon, at least,
the British and Irish system was
practised in Greece. This perfectly agrees with the

assertion of Herodotus about the letters in right lines, because it was hardly possible to
engrave any other on staves.
The next step after squared staves, was the use of thin lamina: of wood, like the sticks
of a fan, strung together in the same manner. They are common in the cabinets of the
curious.
When the muses inspired Hesiod to sing of the gods, they gave him a staff of green
laurel., to cut or shave and mark!

consist of straight lines and angles. The same is to be observed of the Italian letters

The Druids of Ireland did not pretend to be the inventors of these secret systems ot
letters, but said that they inherited them from the most remote antiquity.
WHEN THE OGHAM WRITING WLS INVENTED.-*CHLP. I. SECT. XXXII.
From the great similiarity of the Bethluisnion Ogham to the most ancient of the
ancient alphabets, I am induced to suppose it was the first invented by the priests of the
patriarchal nation, perhaps the Druids, and the secret letter used by them. Indeed,
when a person compares the constantly increasing simplicity of these alphahets, and
their tendency, as we recede, to lines at diferent angles to one another, he might be
induced to suspect that something of the kind must have been the original lirst letter.
The oldest Greek and Runic in Mr. Astle's Tables are almost entirely right lines, which
agrees with what Herodotus says, that the Greeks and Ionians originally had characters
entirely composed of right lines. This, in principle, would diH`er in no way from the
Irish Ogham and the northem Runes. There is every reason to believe that all these
northern systems of secret letters descended from the secret letters or Oghams of the
Druids.
If the reader will east his eye for one moment to the several Oghams in Table II. Fi-
gure 10, placed in a
perpendicular direction, he will at once see
why the letters came to

be compared to the leaves of trees, and the language to the tree itseltl A very striking
coincidence or intimate relation, evidently exists between the leaves and the tree. Whe-
ther the names of the leaves preceeded the tree, or the tree the leaves, it is impos-
sible now to determine. Some of the early Gnostic Christian sectaries, who drew their
doctrines notoriously from the Zoroasterian fountain, had many very odd fangies about
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil of Eden; and if the learned Spaniard before
named, Gorius, and Swinton, had happened to have found twelve instead of thirteen radical
letters in the old Celtic of Spain, or the Etruscan of Italy, I should have been tempted to
have said, Behold the Gnostic allegory! Here is their tree of knowledge of good and
evil, bearing twelve branches, each bringing forth its fruit!

CHAP. II.
TENTH CHAPTER OF GENESIS.-CI-IAP. II. SECT. I.
Or-' all the different books which we
possess, there is no one which is so much entitled
to respect from philosophers, both from those who do not, as well as from those who do,
believe in the divine mission of CHRIST, as the book of Genesis. It is equally entitled
to respect whether we consider it with a view to its antiquity or its genuineness, if it be
considered only (as evidently it ought to be) as a
compilafzbn by Moses, and not as his ori-
ginal composition : for it is clearly a collection of tracts, and not the work of one
person.
On looking into this book, in the tenth chapter, we find an account of seventy-two
heads of families, from whom the diH`erent nations of the earth were descended. The
phraseology of this chapter is very uncommon ; but if it were
stripped of its oriental
dress, and put into the plain, unadorned, simple language of the western nations, and of
the present day, free from figure of any kind, I apprehend the greatest part of it would be
THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF GENESIS MISPLACED.*~CHA.P. II. SECT. II. 89
proved by profane historians to be true, with such cleamess, that no
philosopher, though
he did not believe in the divine inspiration of the Pentateuch, would refuse his assent to
it. If it be taken, not as a divine, but merely a common
history, it exhibits a
knowledge
of the nations of the earth surprisingly correct, and aifords a fair opportunity to the
Christian and Jewish philosopher to maintain, that it contains too much information to
be accounted for in any other way than by divine inspiration.
Upon this point I give no
opinion, as I wish to write to the world, not as a
partisan of
any particular sect of religionists. I state the matter
nakedly as it appears to me. I
should be sorry to suppress the fair and honest argument either of the Christian or of
the Deist.
THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF GENESIS MISPLACED.-CHAP. II. SECT. II.
Upon looking into the next chapter, we End it said, that "
the whole earth was of one
speech," and that they travelled "
from the East." Learned men, I think, have shewn,
that the text would justify a more limited expression than the whole earth. This it is
very important to state; for, it removes the great ditliculty of so
many as
seventy-two
nations travelling in one
company and settling in one
plain, and also of their having
arisen at such an
incredibly short period after the deluge ofthe whole earth is represented
to have taken place! Many persons also have maintained, that the lirst nine verses of
the eleventh chapter have been improperly placed. It has been thought by very leamed
men, that they ought to precede the tenth. To both these opinions I certainly sub-
scribe. I consider the liberty I am now
taking of transposing part of a collection of
tracts, as
very different from either adding to or
deducting any thing from it. Besides,
some parts of the Pentateuch are placed in the old Samaritan version, in different places
from what they occupy in the Hebrew. This clearly proves that in one or other of the
versions a want of care in its preservation has taken place: and as this has happened
in one case, it is fair to argue that it may have happened in another. The second verse
of the eleventh chapter says,
"
and it came to pass, as
they travelled snou 'rr-IE East,
that they found a
plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there." In all our
maps,
Mount Afdfdf is placed between the Black and Caspian Seas: and the plain of Shinar
is placed at Babylon. These maps have been made by learned and ingenious men, fiom
comparing together and construing the texts of profane and sacred authors, geographers,
and others, as
they thought most proper: and no Christian will deny, that we have as
much right to consider them, and to put what we think the nigh# construction on them,
as they had. Now, if we
compare the situation where Ararat is placed, with that of
Babylon, it will be apparent at once, that, if the book be true, the mount where the ark

4-U THE A`UTHOR'S HYPOTHESIS SUPPORTED BY MB. BRYAN1'.*SEC'1'. III.
rested cannot lie between the two seas.* For, to have travelled from any place between the
seas to Babylon, they must have moved from the North to the South, and not from the
East. Nothing can be more distinct and clear than this. In iirct, there is no
authority for
placing Ararat between the two seas, or for placing Shinar and the Tamer qfCanjiarion, or
Babel, at Babylon. A slight similarity of name is not sudicient of itself to justify the
location, when dirwtly in the teeth of the text, as it is here. Then it will follow, that
Ararat and Shinar must have been situated to the east of Babylon, and we shall lind that
these places may have been somewhere about Bactriana, near the Oxus and Jaxartes.
THE AU"I'HOB.'S HYPOTHESIS SUPPOBTED BY MR. BRYANT.-SECT. III.
Mr. Bavazvr says, and I particularly lay a stress upon his opinion, because his
learning is well known, "
I am far from being satisfied, that the whole of mankind was
engaged in this expedition ii-om the East. The Scripture does not seem to say so, nor
can there be any reason assigned why they should travel so far merely to be dispersed
afterward."
I never for a moment permit any imagined injury to the Christian religion to stand in
the way of what I conceive to be the truth, knowing well that, if the Christian doctrine
be true, my doctrine, whether tme or false, can never hurt it or prevail against it. But I
am
always happy when I iind that the result of my fearless speculations is not at variance
with my own or the commonly-received religion, or that, as in this case, I am
supported
by the most learned of my countrymen.
By a train of very curious and satisfactory reasoning, Mr. Bryant shews, that the text
does not warrant the impossible conclusion, that all the nations of the earth named in the
tenth chapter of Genesis were assembled in the little plain of Shinar. It delights me to
see the text of this most ancient and venerable book rescued from the absurdities of
mistaken, though well-intentioned, translators or commentators. Mr. Bryant was a
very
learned man, and his opinion is deserving of high respect, notwithstanding some nonsen»
sical views which he might entertain respecting the adoration by the Gentiles of the ark
fy' Noa5.1'
If the opinion of Mr. Bryant be adopted, that only a.
part of mankind were dispersed
by the coniiision of Babel; that only a part travelled to Shinar, and thence were disper-
sed; in that case, Babel might mean
Babylon, consistently both with my theories, and
those of M. BAILLIE, of which I shall presently speak. This assuredly removes much
diiiicnlty; and certainly the language does not necessarily imply that all the nations of
the earth travelled to Shinar. Yet I still maintain, that though there will be no objection
to it, there is no authority for placing Babel at Babylon, except a
slight similarity of
° See Map. 1- Vol. III. pp. 20-28.
THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF GENESIS._~CHAP. II. SECT. IV. 41
name. But I go a little tiirther than this, and I maintain, that the Fact of the word Babel
meaning confusion, is at once a
proof that it cannot have been the proper name of the
city. No city would ever call itself by such a name, and all cities take the name in the
world which they give themselves.
TRANSPOSITION OF PART OF THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF GENESIS.
CRAP. II. SECT. IV.
Now we will suppose the first nine verses of chapter eleven to be placed before chapter
ten. If this be done, and by the mountains of -Ararat be meant Imaus, or the eastern
end of the great chain of the Caucasian mountains, which run
past the south end of the
Caspian Sea far to the east; then, as the text says, they miglitjourneyfrom the east before
they increased to be too numerous to move in one
body, and a plain of moderate size
would contain them. The expression of the "
mountains of Ararat" in the plural num-
ber, seems to shew, that one
single, isolated mountain was not meant, but one of a
chain. But if Ararat be meant, as now placed, between the Black Sea and the Caspian,
the text says what is impossible; for they must have travelled from the north, not from the
east, as the map which I have given shews. If what I propose be admitted, the book
will be reconciled to itself; and every diiiiculty removed; whether the whole, or, as Mr.
Bryant thought, only a part, of the nations migrated. We can never
mathematically
demonstrate where Babel and Shinar were situated. No point of doctrine depends upon
the question; aconsiderable doubt must always remain, and, therefore, common sense
requires, that we should place them in the situation most consistent with the context,
with history, and with probability.
Persons who read this are requested to observe, that by the slight transposition of the
order proposed by me, without altering a word of the text, we come at a
possibility
instead of an
impossibility. Therefore the argument may be considered as a conditional
one, and it will be assumed, that by Ararat was meant, some mountain eastward of the
Caspian Sea. To make these suppositions, is not to take half so
great a
liberty as is
taken in various other cases, to make the text agree with our imperfect knowledge. In
tact, in this case all that it amounts to is, that we have been mistaken in the situation of
a
place nowhere particularly described. This theory brings the sacred volume much
nearer, in fact reconciles it, to the geographical theory, founded on astronomical calcula-
tions, of the celebrated Monsieur BAILLIE, as laid down in his }Hstory of Astronomy.
This being admitted, then, it will follow that the lower
qfco1y"usion, as the Hebrew calls
it, was not the tower or observatory of the Assyrian God Baal or Bel, as it has been
supposed. It must have been some other tower in the East. The Pentateuch nowhere
says, that the temple at Babylon was Babel; this is only an unauthorized assumption
of divines.

GREAT KNOWLEDGE DISPLAYED IN' THE TENTH CHAPTER OF GEXESIS.
CHAP. II. SECT. V.
Many learned men have considered the tenth chapter of Genesis to be merely a
geographical description of' the earth as it became divided amongst the nations. In
whatever different points of view persons may consider it, I apprehend every one
will be obliged to allow, that it displays a knowledge oi' the world little to be
expected amongst the records of a secluded mountain of Palestine. It was, with no
little surprise and pleasure, I found the Rev. Mr. Davies* outgrowing the prejudices oi
his order and his nursery, and opening his eyes to the evident truth that this very curious
and very ancient book was not the work of one man, but was a collection of tracts, though
chiefly made, according to received tradition and to probalibity, by Moses.
According to the view which I take of this subject, the reader will perceive that it is
my opinion, that the great legislator who partly Wrote and partly compiled the Penin-
teuch, had no object beyond giving his people a code of laws for the regulation of their
worship to their Creator, and of their moral conduct to their neighbour; their duty to
God and man. And pray, what can any one wish for more? This evidently removes
diiiiculties without end, and leaves the doctrine of the divine inspiration of Moses per-
fectly untouched. What a mass of thorns and briars it instantly sweeps away! and not
a single dogma of the Greek, Roman, Protestant, or Calvinist, does it aB'ect.
Ignorant persons will be alarmed at the supposition that the books of Genesis should
have been written by an uninspired penman. It is extraordinary that they cannot per-
ceive, that if the writing be adopted by an inspired person, it is precisely the same thing,
as far as inspiration is concerned, as if he wrote it himself. Besides, why may not
Moses have adopted these histories, by way of accommodation, into his system ; a
system
only intended to serve as a rule of faith in doctrine and morals, without being responsi-
ble for any thing contained in them, except what is necessary to that end ?
EXAMINATION 0F ARABAT AND ARMENIA.-CHAP. II. SEC1'.VI.
In order to support what I have said, I now think it right to detain my reader by
making a few observations on the consideration of the word Afdfdf. This word is
formed of the two words 'ni-Wn Er-ird, which mean the mountain qf descent. Mr. Le
Clerc1' says, "pro 19113; Arr-t, Moses reperitur in codicc Samaritano, (91171 (Ent)

Ibelieve it is a
general tradition in India, which is supported by the most ancient
of the books of the Bramins, that the ark rested near Bactriana, on the Himmaleh
mountains, which mea.n, in Sanscrit, the Mountains of the Moon.. And what says the
Latin Vulgate? Why, that it rested on a mountain of Armenia. And what is Arme.
nia? It is a word composed of the two words 'IPI er, a mountain, and um mai, the
moon, i. e. Har-mini. In Amos, it is called 71110-'|f| E,~.mu,,e, or mgunmin of the
moon. The version of the Seventy here renders it Montem Remman. Aquila renders
it Montem Armona. Theodotion, Montem Mona. They are all, except the Seventy,
exactly the same; and on it Mr. Bryant observes, "Even the Remman of the Seventy
is a
transposition of the true name for Ar-man, the same as Armini in the Chaldee
paraphrase." Now Mr. Bryant allows, that the Taurus extended far to the
East, and that there was a mountain there called Da-moan (that is THE moon, Da
being the Chaldaic particle analogous to our
particle ras), where tradition says the
ark rested.
As usual, every engine has been set in motion to force the word :WU mlrdm, ex

place with the plain of Senaar. Some have put it at Babylon, some at Bagdad, some in
Pontus; in short, it has been put every where but to the East, where it ought to be."

ST. JEROM BESPECTING BABYLON AND SHINAR.-'CHAP. II. SECT. VIII.
St. Jerom, without reflecting upon the improbability that any persons should call
their grand and new-built city by the name of conjiwion or Babel, was taken with the
similarity of the word. Reading of the wickedness of Babylon, and of the famous
astronomical observatory, then called astrological, to which word he had no
partiality;
finding also that there were near it mountains of Menu or the moon; he hastily deter-
mined that these mountains of the moon must be the place where the ark rested. He
never thought of looking to see if there were
any other armenias or mountains of the
moon: if he had, he might have found several mountains of this name: for instance, one
in Bactriana, another in the African Ethiopia, at the head of the Nile, others in Spain,
and others in Ireland.
The tower was doubtless called Babel or
coryfusion: but the city of Babylon was
only
called by the Israelites Babel, as a mark of disgrace or execration, in the same way that
they called the city of On or Heliopolis, or the city of the Sun, in Egypt, the city qf de-
struction. The proper name of Babylon and its temple may be seen in Herodotusrf

Richardson, not attending to the meaning ofthe word Armenia, says, that it is much
more extensive than was generally imagined; and, that it was considered nearly the
same as ancient Parthia.1 Here we find this learned man oéliged to stretch his Arme-
nia into Parthia.
Though nothing can be inferred from the present ruins of Babylon in favour of what I
have advanced, there is certainly nothing found there against it. For if travellers, whose
minds have been prejudiced, think they see the remains of the observatory, they have
nothing of the appearance of the base of a tower whose summit was to reach to heaven.

About the beginning of the French Revolution, the celebrated philosopher Barnus
published his History of Ancient Astronomy, in which he endeavoured to prove, that
the first race of men after the flood had been situated on the East of the Caspian Sea, and
thence had extended towards the South. This he defended with so much talent, that it
raised an
outcry from the bigots in all quarters, who spared no exertion to run down and
misrepresent what they could not retiite; and to this end, some men, who ought to have
been above such unworthy proceedings, lent themselves.
The following is a
passage of Sir William Jones's, quoted with approbation by the
Rev. Mr. Maurice. Speaking of the doctrine of M. Baillie, Sir W. Jones says,
"
Great
learning and great acuteness, together with the charms of a most engaging style, were
indeed necessary to render even tolerable a
system which places an
earthly paradise, the
gardens of Hesperus, the islands of the Macares, the groves of Elysium, if not of Eden,
the heaven of Indra, the Peristan, or fairy land, of the Persian poets, with its city of
diamonds, and its country of Shadcam, (so named from pleasure and love,) not in any
climate which the common sense of mankind considers as the seat of delights, but beyond
the mouth of the Oby in the Frozen Sea, in a
region equalled only by that, where the
wild imagination of Dante led him to lix the worst of criminals in a state of punishment
fter death and which he could not, he says, even think of without shivering." I have
3 »
scarcely ever met with a more williil misrepresentation than this. Most uncandidly Sir
W. Jones conceals from his readers that M. Baillie spoke ofa time previous to the flood,
and founded his doctrine upon a supposition that bqfbre that event, in
consequence ot
the axis of the earth being placed in a diferent direction from that in which it now is, and
other causes, the climate of the Polar regions must have been mild and temperate*

tudes of forty and fifty, or about fifty degrees of north latitude; a
country which would
not be, as
artfully represented by Mr. Maurice, to throw discredit on the doctrine which
he could not refute, uninhabitable from perpetual snow, but a country possessing a
climate somewhat milder than that of London-than that of lat. 5l§. M. Baillie endea-
vours to prove, that some of the most celebrated observations and inventions relating to
astronomy, from their peculiar character, could have taken place only in those latitudes,
and that arts and improvement gradually travelled thence to the equator. The people
to whom his description is most applicable, are the northern progeny of Bramins, settled
near the Imaus, and in northern Thibet-a country in which very celebrated colleges
of learned Indians were anciently established, particularly at Nagracut and Cashmere,
where it is supposed very considerable treasures of Sanscrit literature are deposited, but
which have not yet been examined. Mr. Hastings, who is unquestionably an irre-
proachable witness, informed Mr. Maurice, that an immemorial tradition prevailed at
Benares, which was itself in modern times the grand emporium of Indian lea.rning, and
therefore the less likely to preserve such a tradition, against itself; that all the learning of
India came from a
country situated in forty degrees of northern latitude. On this the
Rev. Mr. Maurice says, "This in fact is the latitude of Samarcand, the metropolis of
Tartary, and by this circumstance the position of M. Baillie should seem to be con-
iirmed." And it is also the country where we shall see, according to the testimony of
Josephus and other ancient historians, cited by the learned Abbe Pezron, that the first
Celtae are to be found. The astronomical calculations, the tradition, and the evidence of
the old writers, all seem to coniirm the doctrine advanced by Baillie; and though this is
contrary to the theory of divines, it is absolutely necessary to make the book of Genesis
consistent with well-known fact and history. For, I repeat once more, that if Shinar were
Babylon, and if Ararat were between the Caspian and Black Seas, the nations could not
have travelled from the East, but from due North. If the correction which is here sug-
gested be adopted, not the correction of Genesis, but the correction of a mistaken idea or
inference of divines, or of Gentile geographers, a
very considerable step will have been
taken to reconcile Genesis with tradition, profane history, and astronomy; but I fear as
usual, many divines, who permit their zeal to blind their judgment, will rather consent to
see their sacred book open to the well-tbunded attacks of philosophers, than yield their
own superannuated prejudices. I do not blame them liar being jealous of any change, or
of the application of critical or
theological conjecture to this venerable book. Indeed,
the last is totally inadmissible; and is, as
Bishop Marsh calls it, no better than wiliill
corruption? But this caution is surely carried too far when it prevents the correction
of gross mistakes of transcribers, or of the effects of former theological conjecture, or the
correction of various readings by comparison of the Samaritan and Hebrew versions, or
the transposition of parts of them when, by so doing, great diiiiculties will be removed.

Surely this book is entitled to all the fair advantage which would be afforded to a Horace
or a
Virgil.
M. Baillie thus commences his History of Astronomy:
"
Nous entendons par l'astro-
nomie antediluvienne la plus ancienne dont nous
ayons connoissance. Ce n'est pas que
les Fairs ou l'l1istoire en établissent l' époque precise, et puissent faire juger d' une maniere
incontestable, si elle doit étre placée an tems des premiers hommes, c'est-a-dire, des patri-
arches qui vivoient sur la terre avant la destruction terrible du genre humain: mais
instruits, de la date de cet évenement memorable, renfermée par les chronologistes sacrés
dans des bornes dont nous avons choisi la plus reculée, nous devons regarder les iiaits
d'une antiquité plus haute, les connoissances qui n'ont pu étre acquises depuis, et dans
la durée d'une monde en
quelque fagon si jeune encore, comme des faits que ont précédé
lc dé|uge."'*
(By antediluvian astronomy we mean the most ancient oi'which we have any knowledge.
Not that facts or
history establish its precise epoch, and enable us
satisfactorily to decide
whether it should be assigned to the period of the first race of men, viz., the patriarchs
who lived before the deluge: but, acquainted as we are with the date of that memorable
event, confined by the sacred chronologists within limits of which we have adopted the
most distant, we should consider facts of a
higher antiquity, and aoquirements in know-
ledge which cannot have been made since, and within the period of a world in some
measure still new, as
facts which preceded the deluge.)
OPINIONS OF BAILLIE, BUFFON, AND LINNB, ON THE EARTH AND ON MAN.
CHAP. II. SECT. XII.
About the time when M. Baillie lived, the natural philosophers of France, with M.
Bulfon at their head, had indulged themselves in many very curious speculations
respecting the origin and formation of man, &c. &c., and M. Baillie supposed with
BuE`on, Linné, and several others, that the earth, previous to the formation ofthe human
race, had been in a state of iiision; that it had gradually cooled, and that the cold
was
by very slow and imperceptible degrees gradually increasing. From a very close
attention to the nature of the ancient mythologies, all which are intimately connected
with astronomy, they imagined, that man had been created, and that the arts and sciences
had taken their rise, not far from the arctic circle, where the earth had Hrst cooled--and
that they had extended southwards as it by degrees became more and more cold. Many
sepulchres and other very surprising remains of antiquity, &c., had been found in upper
Tartary, about the neighbourhood of Selenginskoi, so
disgraceliilly alluded to by Sir. W.
Jones. These were supposed to be remains of an ancient world previous to the flood.
This being new to the ignorant devotees amongst the priests, they instantly took the

alarm, and the outcry of Atheism, as usual, was raised; though in all this, when the Brat
verse of Genesis is properly explained, there is not a word either in favour of Atheism,
or against the Jewish and Christian dispensation. All that it opposes is, the ipse Jiri!
of Jerom, the Monk, by whom modern divines have been misled. Alter the flood, as
the reader will have collected from the Rev. Mr. Maurice's expression cited above, (p. 46,)
Baillie supposed that the first increase of man took place between the latitudes forty and
fifty, but East of the Caspian, not West of it. In his reasons for fixing the longitude here,
he was
guided by a
great number of concurring circumstances, all tending to produce his
conviction of that fact.
BAILLIE,S REASONS FOR HIS HYPOTIIESIS-CHAP. II. SECT. XIII.
Amongst many other things he has remarked, that the knowledge displayed by the
ancients, of the movements of the sun and moon in their cycles of nineteen and six
hundred years-the Metonic cycle, and the Neros, prove that, long before Hipparchus,
the father of modern astronomy, lived, who did not correct, but rather increased the errors
of his predecessors, the age of the year was known with a degree of exactxtude which
'
' '
~
th li ht in these
Hipparchus had not the means of discovering. and, that e s
g errors
ancient cycles were not found out till after the lapse of nineteen hundred years. He
observes, that these cycles could not have been the invention of an ignorant and barbarous
ed tio
age, and thence infers, that they were part of the science of a generation far remov m
us. Josephus has ainrmed, that the cycle of 600 years was the invention of the Antedi-
luvians. This must have come to him by tradition from the Patriarchs ; and was
proba-
bly well known to Abraham, and to the Druids, as we shall soon see.
CYCLE OF THE NEROS,=CHAP. II. SECT. XIV.
The cycle of the Neros is worthy of much observation: it is formed by 7,4-21 lunar
revolutions of 29 days, 12 hours, 4-4 minutes, 8 seconds, which make 219,146 days and
a half; and this same number of 219,146 and a half; give six hundred solar years of
565 days, 5 hours, 51 minutes, 86 seconds each, which differs less than 8 minutes from
what its length is observed to be at this day. Now Ptolemy and Hipparchus made the
year to be 865 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, 12 seconds.
Supposing this cycle were correct to a second, if on the Brst of January at noon a new
1110011 took þÿPlH¢ ¬»
if W01ld take PINS again in exactly six hundred years, at the same
moment of the day, and under all the same circumstances.
The least that can be said for the evidence of Josephus, that it was of antediluvian
invention, is, that it is the record of an ancient tradition, and, under all the circum-
stances, a very respectable record. M. Baillie has gone at great length into the history of
BAILLIE ON THE SEVEN-DAY CYCLE.=CI-IAP. II SECT. XV. 49
this cycle, and thinks he has proved, that it must have been of antediluvian invention,
and that nothing less than such a
catastrophe as a flood could have caused so
important
a discovery to be forgotten. Now it is quite certain that the Egyptians, in very early
times, did not understand the length ofthe year, but assigned it only 360 days. It is also
very certain from this Neros, that the length of the year was in still earlier times known
with a much greater degree of' correctness. All this looks very like a science forgotten
and like endeavours to recover it, according to the hypothesis of M. Baillie. It is posi-
tively asserted by astronomers, that this cycle could not have been discovered except by
a
very long series of observations-a series of' at least two periods of six hundred years
each, during which the observations must have been taken with great care and regularly
recorded.
BAILLIE ON' THE SEVEN-DAY CYCLE.-Cl-IAP. II. SECT. XV.
The circumstances attending the septennial cycle or the week, M. Baillie thinks,
shew that it must have been established previously to the flood, because he finds the days
dedicated to the planets by the Chinese, the Indians, the ancicnt and the modern Euro-
peans,-not in any order regulated by the distance, or the size, or the brilliancy of them,
but arbitrarily, and in all nations alike, and all dedicated to the same Gods. He thinks
it is impossible that chance should have led all these nations to adopt tne same
arbitrary
order and names; and he can devise no
way of accounting for these circumstances,
except by supposing that the order and names existed before the flood, and were com-
municated, by the few that escaped, to their descendants. He also shews, that the
ancients had succeeded in measuring the circumference of the globe with a
very great
degree of correctness. Ahzer much curious and interesting reasoning, he has observed,
that in Chaldea we have found rather the débris of science, than the elements of' it. He
asks,
"
when you see a house built of old capitals of columns and other fragments of'
beautiful architecture, do you not conclude that a fine building has once existed ?"
Speaking of the situation of the first nation after the flood, he says,
"
Quand je parle
du nord de l'Asie je ne prétend assigner aucun
degré de latitude; j'entend seulement les
pays plus septentrionaux que la Chine, les Indes, la Perse, et la Chaldee."*
f
(When I speak of' the north of Asia, I do not pretend to fix any certain degree 0
latitude ; I only mean a
country more to the north than China, India, Persia, or
Chaldea.)
How different from the representation of Sir W. Jones!-M. Baillie sums
up his
argument with the following observations:
"
These facts, then, unite to produce the same conclusion ; they appear to prove to us,
that the ancient people who brought the sciences to perfection, a
people who Succeeded

in the great enterprise of discovering the exact measurement ofthe earth, dwelt under the
4-9th defrree of latitude. If the human mind can ever flatter itself' with having been suc-
cessiiil discovering the truth, it is when many Facts, and these facts of different kinds,
unite in producing the same result."
SIR W. DRUMMOND SUPPORTS BAILLIE.1CHAP- II. SECT.XVI.
On this subject the following observations from the pen of the honourable and leamed
Srn W. Dnunmonn are so much in point, that it is impossible to omit them:
"
The fact, however, is certain, that at some remote period there were mathematicians
and astronomers who knew that the sun is in the centre of the planetary system, and
that the earth, itself a
planet, revolves round the central tire;-who calculated, or like
ourselves attempted to calculate, the return of comets, and who knew that these bodies
move in elliptic orbits, immensely elongated, having the sun in one of their foci ;-who
indicated the number of the solar years contained in the great cycle, by multiplying a
eriod (variously called in the Zend, the Sanscreet, and the Chinese, een, van, and p/zen)
P
of 180 years, by another period of 14-4 years ;-who reckoned the sun's distance fiom
the earth at 800,000,000 of Olympic stadia; and who must, therefore, have taken the
parallax of that luminary by a method, not only much more perfect than that said to be
invented by Hipparchus, but little inferior in exactness to that now in use
among the
modems ;-who could scarcely have made a mere
guess, when they Exed the moon's
distance from its primary planet at fifty-nine semidiameters of the earth ;-who had
measured the circumference of our globe with so much exactness, that their calculation
only diH`ered by a few feet from that made by our modern geometricians ;-who held that
the moon and the other planets were worlds like our own, and that the moon was diver-
sified by mountains and valleys and seas ;-who asserted, that there was
yet a
planet
which revolved round the sun, beyond the orbit of Saturn :-who reckoned the planets
to be sixteen in number ;-and who reckoned the length of the tropical year within
three minutes of the true time; nor, indeed, were they wrong at all, if a tradition men-
tioned by Plutarch be correct.""* And now, Sir Wiliam, may I be permitted to ask,
of what nation do you think these astronomers were? Do you suppose they were
the Indians who forgot their formulae, the Egyptians or the Chaldeans who fixed the
year at S60 days, or the Greeks who laughed at the stories of the comets' being planets?
Search where you will you must go to Baillie's nation, between forty and fifty degrees
of latitude. And that great man, the successor of Galileo, Bacon, and Worcester, In
spite of the priests, must at last have justice done him.

MR. LEDWICH ALSO SUPPORTS BAILLIEJ'-CHAP. II. SECT. XVII,
The Rev. Mr. Lnnwrcn is obliged to make the following admission,which, coming fi-om
so learned an opponent to the doctrine I advocate, is very important:
"
I am free to confess
that there seems to have been a
very remote period, of which we have scarce a
glimpse,
when knowledge had attained to its present perfection; and this the learned M. Durens
has made more than probable in his '
Recherches sur
l'Origine des Découvertes attri-
buées aux Modernesj wherein he has clearly demonstrated, that our discoveries in the
natural and moral world are not novel, but the same as those delivered by antiquity;
and that where the parallel fails, it is to he ascribed to the want of literary memorials,
now buried amid the ruins of time. However, I refer to an epoch antecedent to the
flourishing state of knowledge in Greece. Iwould seek for it in Egypt, Media, and
particularly in Chaldeaz* I would say with Galen, that no man or age is suiiicient to
erfect an art or science, and that when we behold them advanced to such astonlshing
P Y
maturity in those ancient empires, they must have been long before known and culti-
vated.1' That learning visited the parched sand of Africa, and the chilling regions of the
north, that it illuminated every climate from the rising to the setting sun, is no new dis-
covery. Besides the labours of erudition, modern travellers give proofs of this enough
to convince the most incredulous."¢ I quite agree with Mr. Ledwich that a leamed
nation formerly existed: but it was not in Egypt, or in Chaldea. He may search, but
he will not find it in either. I am
glad of the opportunity of shewing that the priests
are beginning to open their eyes.
From a careful consideration of the tenth chapter of Genesis it is perfectly clear, that
the author was well informed in the topography of all the nations of the then known
world, and that he ascribed their origin in general to the source whence etymology and
history shew that the nations themselves derived it. This will be ascribed by many to
inspiration: on this poi11t of course every one will judge for himself; but I beg leave to
observe, that it is very unphilosophical to ascribe any thing to a miraculous cause which
D
can be accounted for without it. And surely no one who has perused Mons. Dutens s
beautiful Essay on the Discoveries of the Ancients attributed to the Moderns, can doubt
the possibility of the author of Genesis having received his knowledge from one of the
persons of great lmrning who had flourished before that time; perhaps one of the order of
persons from whom Pyt/lagoras learned the true system of the universe, 8cc.§

PERSIA, INDIA, AND CHINA, THE DEPOSITARIES, NOT THE INYENTORS OF
SCIENCE.-CHAP. II. SECT. XVIII.
Ir is now the Fashion to believe, that the generation for the time present is always
more enlightened than the generation preceding. But is this true? Probably for
many hundred years back to the present time it may be true. But were the generations
in the ninth century of Christianity more enlightened than those in the time ofAugustus?
I am inclined to think that after the ilood, for many generations, man did not improve,
but gradually fell off in science; and that what we find in Babylon and Egypt, were
the ruins of a
mighty building which philosophers were then endeavouring to recon-
struct, and amongst which Pyt/zagoras found some beautiful specimens of ancient archi-
tecture, which he brought to Greece, and which the vanity of the Greeks soon tempted
them to claim as their own. The philosophic Baillie has remarked, that every thing in
China, India, and Persia, tends to prove that these countries have been the depositaries
of science, not its inventors. He says, the things alluded to, do not assimilate to the
climate or the countries; they appear in an unnatural state, like the elephant at Paris.
He adds, "
when I contemplate this gigantic beast, which with us will not propagate
its kind, I instantly conclude that it is a
stranger. Thus it is with many of the inci-
dents in the systems of the Hindoos ; they suit not to the climate nor to the heavens ;
they are daily dying away ; they barely exist ;-hence I conclude them a race of tbreign
growth."
I consider the instance of the Neros as a
very strong part of M. Baillie's system, and
therefore I have selected it as an example, and dwelt upon it the longer; but it forms a
very small part of the argument in support of his doctrine. As this is only incident to
my subject, the Druids, I do not think it proper to go into the whole case, but must
leave my friends to consult Baillie's beautiful work itself; which is justly admitted by
Sir William Jones, as the reader has seen, (p. 4-5,) to possess
"
leaming and acuteness,
and a most engaging style."
WHO THE CELTJE WERE.*CHAP. II. SECT. XIX.
It now becomes necessary to shew who were the ancient Celtz. "Celtaa, Gauls,
Gaedil, Cadel, or Keill, and in the plural, according to our dialect, Keiliet, or Keilt
(now Guidhelod) Irishman. The word Keilt could not be otherwise written by die
Romans than Ceilté or Celtw."°
Caesar says the Gauls were called Celtaa: "
Qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli
appellantur."1'

wno THE cEr.r.~s wana.-cnar. Il. sacr. xxx. 53
They were by the Romans always called Goals, and by the Greeks Celtre or Kelt,
Km-ran. Whenever Parthenius speaks of the Gauls, in the story of Hercules and
Celtina, he makes use of the term Kekrwv, 01'
Kskrivqv Celtina, or Kswrov Celtum.
And in the same story Diodorus Siculus calls the Gaul, Kelt or Celta-1 of Parthenius, by
the name of I`a.>.a-rqv Galates, the people Galatians. Callimachus, in his hymn in Delum,
indiscriminately uses the words G-alates, and the country Galatia, and Celtm, for one
another.-As we have already seen, Virgil calls the inhabitants of Cisalpine Gaul Galata.
The Abbé Pezron treating of the Celtae says,
"
At least a
part of them were called
Cimbrians and Cirnmerians, before they bore the names of Galataa and Gauls. The
word Cimbri is taken from the Latin Cimber, and this last is derived from Kimber or
Kimper, which signifies a warrior in the Celtic tongue : it bears the same signilication
amongst the Teutones or Germans : and as for Cimmerian, it is what is softened out of
Cimbri or Cimbrian, as some of them have well observed. But here, by the way, it
is necessary to take notice, that the name of Cimbrians was in a manner given to none
other of the Celtaa but such as
anciently were fixed in the northern parts of' the world.
I mean above the Euxine and to the north of the Danube. It was a
colony of these
people, and a
very ancient one too, that gave name to the Chersonesus, or
according to
modern pronunciation, the Cimbric Chersonesus, now the country of Jutland, beyond
Holstein."
Herodotusf says, that the Celtm are the most remote inhabitants to the West of
Europe, except the Cynetae. These Cyneta-3 I take to be the Cymry or Cimmerii or
Cimbri, who named the Chersonesus. At the mouth of the river Albis, or Elb, on
Herodotus's map, will be found the place called Amber, or Umber. [Hamburg] This
is nearly opposite to the North-Eastern shore of England, where we find the river
Umber, North-Umberland, and C-umberland. Amongst all the gross mistakes of
Herodotus, the truth in respect to these people evidently creeps out, as is proved by the
names which they still retain.:
Diodorus Seculus§ says,
"
And now it will be worth while to declare that which
multitudes are
altogether ignorant oil Those who inhabit the inland parts beyond
Massylia and about the Alps, and on this side the Pyrenean mountains, are called Celta;
but those that inhabit below this part, called Celtica, southward to the
ocean and the
mountain Hyrcinus, and all as far as Scythia., are called Gauls. But the Romans call
all these people generally by one and the same name, Gauls."

In the same cha ter Diodorus says, that Galates, the son of Hercules, ruled in Celtica,
P
built Alesia, (now Arras,) and from his name the people were called Gallatians, and the
country Gallatia, or Gallia, Gaul.
THE CEI/IIE WERE GOMERIANS.-CHAP. II. SECT. XX.
The eldest son of the Japhet of Moses, named in the tenth chapter of Genesis, is said
to have been Gomer, from whom came the Gomerians, afterward called in the west of
Europe the Cimbri and Cimmerians. Zonaras says, that the people of Gaul were called
Gomari, Gomeraei, and Gomeritm. The Bretans call themselves Kumero, Cymero, and
Kurneri. The G or Gimel or Gamma hard, the third [Greek] letter having the power
of 3, became changed into first the C hard or K, then the C soft or sibillant, with the
q under it of the French, but still remaining the third letter.* These people, by abre-
viation called Cimbri, were the same people who under Brennus pillaged Delphi, in
Greece, and are unanimously called Gauls. Appian, in Illyricis, says, they were called
Cimbri. "
The Celti (or Gauls)," says he, "
whom they call Cimbri."
Posidonius (apud Strabo, Lib. vii.) says expressly, that the Greeks gave the Cimbrians
the name of Cimmerians ;
"
Cimbros Graci Cimmerios appellavere."1'
Lucan says, that the assassin sent to kill Marius was called a Cimbrian. Livy calls
him a Gaul; and Reinerus Reineccius, who is called by Camden an excellent historian,
from Plutarch's life of Sertorius, affirms, that the Gauls and Cimbri used the same lan-
guage. Josephus also makes Gomer the father of the Galatm. Bochart understands
them of the Asiatic or Phrygian Galatas, or Gallograecia and Galatia; and Ezekiel places
Gomer north of Judaa, near Togarmah. Now there is surely no difiiculty in finding
the Celta or Keltas in the Galatae, the C and G as usual being changed; but the Britons
were also called Cumeri and Kimbriq;
The Abbé Pezron says,
"
that the most ancient name the Celtm ever bore, while they
remained in higher Asia, was that of Comarians, or rather Gomarians, by some authors
called Gamerites. That was their first and true name, being that which they had from
the earliest times of the world, or rather from their very first origin. They took it from
Gomer, the eldest son of Japhet, he being the person whom they looked upon to be
their father and founder. This name, which now appears to be obscure, was not un-
known to the ancient geographers, and we find it fhmous in the provinces of higher Asia,
whence the Celtm of whom we are speaking had their origin." Josephus, speaking of
Japhet's son, Gomer, says,
"
he was the founder of the Gomerites, who now, by the
Greeks, are called Gauls and Galatians." This has been noticed by Mr. Davies, who

'run caan: wan: comanuns.-cn.u». rr. su;-_ Xx_ 55
says,
"
Josephus informs us, that the persons whom the Greeks call Galata: or Celtaz
were descended from Gomer, described in the tenth chapter of Genesis as the grandsqn
of Noah. Then a
people descended from Gomer might be called :mm G,m~im, gr gn;
G/nri, Gomeri; and as the C or K in the Celtic and other European languages occupies
the place of the Hebrew J G or Gimel, Cirnri or
Cymri or Kimmerii may be nothing but
Gomerii."* Thus we see that, according to Josephus, the Gomarians, or descendants ot'
Gomer, were the Celtaz. On this the Abbé Pezron says,
"
Let us but cast our
eyes a
little upon the books and maps of Ptolemy,'|' the famous geographer, and survey but for
a moment the provinces of higher Asia, I mean those between Media Bactriana, and the
Caspian Sea, and there we shall easily find the Chomarians or Gomarians, who are no
other than the Gomerians of Josephus, and whom some of the ancients have likewise
called Gamarites, which all amounts to the same
thing. The Gomarians, therefore,
according to Josephus, were the Galatians or Gauls." Josephus is a
very respectable
authority to a fact of this kind, particularly in this case for several reasons; but he is far
from the only authority. Eustathius, of Antioch, in the commentary upon the Hexa-
meron, (p. 5l,) and who, after the Septuagint, calls Gomer Gamer, says,
"
Gamer was
the founder of the Gamerians, whom now we call Galatians or Gauls. I`a.p.ep és'-ng
l'a.p.apsa; -ra; vuv l`a.>,a-ra.; a-uvwnya-sv. St. Jerom also adopted this opinion, for he says,
that the Galatians were descended fiom Gomer.; Isidore§ says,
"
Filii autem Japhet
septem numerautur, Gomer, ex quo Galatae, id est, Galli"-The sons of Japhet were
seven, of whom Gomer was the father of the Galatians, that is to say, the Gauls. The
chronicle oi' Alexandria also says, I`a.p.sp :Q é Kami-m-Gamer, fmm whem the Celtae
or Keltz are descended.
Theophilus, of Antioch, says,
"
Ex omnium Historicorum fide certum est, Gomerum
seu Aschenazen, cum aliis Noemi nepotibus, Galliam primos inhabuissez" that is, From
all historians it is certain that Gomer or Aschenaz, with other grandsons of Noah, first
peopled Gaul. From this we learn what was the tradition in the time of Theophilus.
And when the expression of Gomer having peopled Gaul is used, it must be considered
in the same sense as when it is written, Israel passed out of Egypt and peopled Palestine.
It is fiom the construing of figurative expressions of this kind improperly, that much of
the confusion in history has taken its rise.
The Jew Joseph Goronidis, also says,
"
Filii Gomer sunt Franci, qui habitant in
terra Franciw ad tlumen Seina"-The sons of Gomer are the Franks, who dwell in
France on the Seine. He calls these Franks dwelling on the Seine, to distinguish them
from the Franks of Germany. These authorities decidedly prove, that Bochart was
himself mistaken when he accused Josephus of mistake.

PEZR-0N'S SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS:-CHAP. II. SECT. XXI.
The leamed Pezron has justly observed, from these authorities, It is incontestible that,
by the Gomer named in Genesis, the father ofthe Celtm, or Comerians, or Cimmerii, or
Gauls, was meant; and that the place where they came from was to the East of the
Caspian in Bactriana;-that this doctrine respecting the Gomarians is confirmed by
Dyonysius, of Alexandria, or rather of Charax, by Pomponius Mela., Pliny, and
Ptolemy ;-and, that it is still further confirmed by Ezekiel in his 38th chapter, where
he names, amongst others, Gomer et universa agmina sua, as coming down from the
north, over mount Taurus!
Although perhaps enough has been said, I will give one more passage of the Abéé
Pe:ran's: "The Gomarians, as we have already said, having from the very earliest times
possessed themselves of the provinces that lie to the East of the Caspian Sea, and that
reach from Media to the river Jaxartes, several of them stopped in Margiana, which is
a rich and fertile country, and its air temperate and delightfiil. This people, in process
of time, increasing to a vast multitude, could not always live in repose and tranquillity;
the seeds of dissensions and jealousies began to spring up amongst themselves. Amidst
these factions and domestic commotions, those who proved the weaker, either in number
or strength, were expelled by the other, and forced to seek for a retreat in the neighbouring
countries." Here we see the facts admitted, that the Celia did occupy these countries,
and did increase to such great multitudes, that they were
obliged to emigrate. This is
all that is necessary for my argument.
In this argument the only difference between me and the Abbé Pezron is, that he,
mistaking the passage of Genesis, supposes the first increase alterthe flood to have taken
place in Assyria, and then, for this great nation to have gone eastwardv to Bactrianasl'
I suppose that Bactriana was the first place, and that mankind remained there till they
increased very considerably, and then dispersed. To this the consistent Christian
cannot object : to the Deist I say, You will not deny that there has been a
great flood,
or floods, and that mankind must have been saved at the last flood, or created since.
Then I take the liberty to ask him if he will not admit the place where man was saved
or created to have been in latitude 4-5, or thereabouts, and about the longitude of Samar-
kand, where he will please to place it? He may say, perhaps, that he does not allow
the flood, as described in Genesis. I reply, I have said nothing about the particulars of
that event, therefore you have no right to make them an objection: and the Christian

cannot object, because I have not denied a single particular of Genesis. My argument,
therefore, is conclusive to both."
OBSERVATION BESPECTING THE OPPOSITION OF PBIESTS.--CHAP. II,
SECT. XXII.
It has been observed to me, that it is useless to my theory or
system to move the location
of the first inhabitants of the earth from between the seas to the East of the Caspian, and
that, by so
doing, I should offend all the priests and devotees. I shall not give up an
argument founded in truth, whether it make for or
against religion, as
they may fancy,
to please any of them. It is not likely, then, that I should give up an
argument which
I see is necessary not only to truth, but to the authenticity of the books of Genesis and
ot' Christianity also. It delights me to be able to place Genesis on a firm founchtion,
by shewing that it is consistent with tradition, astronomy, and profane history. It
appears to me to be of the lirst importance to fix the situation of the Erst people where
I have placed it, instead of in the interval between the two seas, because it removes
many
great and serious objections to the history, which are necessarily raised by the facts
pointed out by Baillie. Let it not be forgotten, that if philosophers had waited on
priests, they might still have been watching the .run running his diurnal course.
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT.-CRAP. II. SECT. XXIII.
I have now, I think, proved, upon unquestionable evidence, that the Gomarians were
the Celtm, and that they were situated to the East of the Caspian Sea. I have also
shewn, that this is not only not contrary to sacred writ, but that it is connected with
rmsoning which explains the text of the sacred writer, and removes several great ditlicul-
ties. I shall, therefore, consider that I am justified in assuming it as a
provedfact.
I must now draw the reader's attention to the famous Uuaauus of Italy, and their
predecessors, their contemporaries, or their successors, the Ernuscans, by whom Mn
I/'allencey thought Ireland was colonized. There is no
people on the face of the earth
whose history is more curious, or more involved in dimculty.

THE UMBRI AND E'1°BUSCANS.-CHAP. II. SECT. XXIV.
Florus states theUmbri to have been the earliest people:
"
Umbri antiquissimus
Italiae populus."* This is confirmed in nearly the same words by Pliny:
"
Gens
antiquissima Italiae."'|' This is again confirmed by Dionysius Halicarnassus, who
says, that it was
avery great and ancient nation: "
Erat ea
gens multum antiqua et
arnpla;"¢ and, that it possessed all Umbria and Tuscany. Abbé Pezron observes, that
the Umbri must have been settled in Tuscany 1500 years before the building of Rome,
and that the Etruscans, when they conquered them, took 300 towns,-" trecenta oppida."
Solimts says, on the credit of Bacchus the historian, that the Umbri were the descendants
of the ancient Gauls: "
G-allorum veterum propaginem Umbros esse."§ Seroius, in his
commentary on the 12th book of the }Eneid, confirms what Solinus has said: "
Sane
Umbros Gallorum veterum propaginem esse, Ma.rcus Antonius refert :"||-Mark Antony
relates that the Umbri are descended from the ancient Gauls. All which is confirmed
by Isidore, of Seville; and the Scholiast of Lycophron says, 0p.Bpoa yew; l"aeM:n:rv-
"
Umbri Gallorum genus"1]'--The Umbri are a race of Gauls. Nothing more need
be added to this. These Umbri are said to have been conquered by the Etruscans, but
who these were is a
very difficult question."
I suspect these Umbri were the persons from whom the Greeks and Etruscans learnt
to make their beautifirl vases, and received their taste for the fine arts; unless, indeed,
they were the same as the Etrusci, or were preceded by them. How to account for the
surprising state of refinement amongst the Tuscans I know not, except they were, as I
suppose, part of the highly civilized society which I have endeavoured to prove existed
in a very remote period, and that it was in very early times that they branched o&' fiom
the parent stock.
'
If it could be admitted that the Etruscans were a Celtic colony, it would seem to shew,
that the people who sent forth such a
colony could not be more barbarous than those
they sent out. Now look at the Etruscan vases in the British Museum, at the bau-
tifiil grouping and colouring of' the figures, and it will be impossible to deny to them a
high degree oi' perfection in the fine arts at least. What can be more beautiful than the
group ofthe birth qfMinerva, so often copied into modern cameos? I was
surprised to
discover the original of this upon an antique brass plate in the cabinet of antiquities at
Bologna, proved to be Etruscan by the names of the gods being inscribed on the
figures in old Etruscan letters.

AFFINITY BETWEEN THB LATIN, SANSCRIT, AND CELTIC.*°CH. II. SEC. XXV. 59
Dionysius Halicarnassus, states, that when Tarquinius Priscus had conquered the
Tyrrheni or Etrusci, he received fi-om them the ensigns of royalty, such as had
been used to be borne by the Lydians and Persians.* What could the Etruscans have
to do with Asurrc ensigns of royalty? I suspect some great mistake in the history,
and the Etruscans or Thusci, with their thirteen letters, to have been one of the very
first subcasts from the Asiatic hive.
I must now beg the reader's attention to the language of the people, who in the first
periods of authentic Roman history (which in factgoes back but a
very few years) are
tbund to have been in possession of the country of the ancient Etruscans, called the
Latin, and to compare it with the Celtic and Sanscrit. And I think when the won-
derhil afiinity is observed between the three, a descent from a common parent, at no
greater distance than one remove, must be admitted. The reader will not forget what
he has seen of the ancient alphabets of these people. The following is a
comparison
between the Celtic, the Sanscrit, and the Latin languages, which may perhaps surprise
the reader. I particularly beg his attention to the names of numbers, and to the helping
verb.

These are a very few examples out of a great number. Mr. Huddleston has very justly
observed, that if the Celtic language or letters are to be derived from the Romans, so must
the Sanscrit. I think it is very evident that the Latin language has not been derived from
the Greek or the Greek from the Phmnician, but that they have all been derived from a
common source now lost. None of the stories of colonies, from here or there, in the
Latin or Greek books are to be depended on for a moment, if in opposition to the extra.-
ordinary coincidence of these alphabets. I request those who object to my doctrines to
account for the identity of the Celtic the Latin and the Sanscrit languages.
I request them to inform me by what road, except that which I shall presently point out,
the Sanscrit could arrive in Italywithout being lost by the intermixture ofthe other langua-
ges. I request them to account to me for the superior state of civilization proved to have
existed amongst the Et1'uscans long before the fine arts flourished in Greece, by many
circumstances-by the fine vases now in such numbers in the British Museum, and by
the temples at Pmstum, which were subjects of admiration to the Romans in the Augus-
tan age, but of whose builders tradition did not even at that time give any probable his-
tory. I request them to inform me, who was the Sybil that founded the oracle at Cuma,
and who were the Cimmerii that dwelt there.
I believe there are many objections to the derivation of the Latin from the Greek. If
it be admitted that the Latin exhibits many terms in a more rude form than that in
which they appear in the Greek, as Dr. Jamieson has observed, and as I believe will not
be denied, a derivation is indicated from a cognate language far less reined. I have no
suspicion that the Latin was derived from the Sanscrit after it was polished and brought
to its present state of perfection, but previously to that event, and previously to the esta-
blishment of the Hindoo polity; after the establishment of which it was not
likely to
travel to Italy. I conceive the Sanscrit was rude like all other languages, (in fact
62 AFFIXITY BETWEEN THE HEBREW AND CELTIC."-CHAP. II. SECT. XXVI.
then Pracrit,) and was moulded into its present fine form, when the Bramin or
perhaps
prior Boodh polity was established. But of this date I give no positive opinion.
Dr. Jamieson says much about the Scythians, which is all applicable to their prede-
cessors the Celtae. The Scythians were nothing but a later tribe of the same people.
Their first appearance was evidently long after that of the Gomerians on the East of the
Caspian. As the Scythians in those early times would have nearly the same
language,
letters, and manners, as the first Gomerians, much of what applies to one will apply to
the other. But there is no
making any thing like order out of the confused accounts of
the Greeks, without keeping the two peoples separate. Dr. Jamieson distinctly and
properly allows that the Celtae were the first. They would consequently have the most
of the primeval character of the antediluvian people, and it is to them that the language
of the first inhabitants of Europe must be attributed, and through them that the languages
must be traced to the East.
The Celtte came first and supplied a language: then in the course of thousands of
years came different tribes of the same people. The language of each radica1{q the same
as the first, but from the lapse of time somewhat changed. If gentlemen would keep
this great principle in view, I think they would find no great difficulty in reconciling all
the discordant accounts.
The following extract from the learned treatise of Dr. Jamieson called Hermes
Sc_yt/zr`cz¢s, will shew that he is in reality entirely of my opinion. His admission is quite
sufficient for my argument: "It seems beyond dispute, that the Cirnmerii were the
posterity of Gomer, the eldest son of Japhet, the Japetus of the Greeks: and that
they were thefrst race who peopled Europe. Their name is obviously retained by the
descendants of the ancient Britons, who still denominate themselves Cumri. As they
anciently possessed the Chersoneus Taurica, and gave their name to the Cimmerian Bos-
phorus, they undoubtedly occupied part of the territory which afterward pertained to the
Scythians."°
Mr. Pinkerton also admits, that the Celtae were the first inhabitants of Europe. This
is quite enough for my argument. Where did they come from P

AFFINITY BETWEEN THE GREEK, SANSCBIT, AND CEL1'IC.1CHAP. II.
SECT. XXVII.
Hecataaus, of Miletus, who lived in the time of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, says,
that the barbarians dwelt in Peloponnesus before the Hellenes or Grzecians. 'On a-gh
-rov E7»71|vwv wxmrav aufqv Ba.gBa¢go|-Qubd ante Graecos habltaverunt eam Barbari.1'
(These Barburi I take to have been the first swarm of Celtae who, we shall see
by and
by, established the oracles at Delphi.) Hecataus says this only of Peloponnesus, but
Strabo and Pausanias say it was the case of almost all Greece.;
These authors are perfectly right. It was natural to suppose that the Barbarians
would not pass Greece in their way to Italy, without giving it a call and leaving marks
behind them ; plenty oi' which may be found in the second chapter of the second book,
and at the cud, of Mons. Pezron's Antiquities qfNation.r, where may be seen a vast
number of Latin and Greek words, which are
evidently derived from the Celtic language.
Amongst a
great mass of fabulous Greek nonsense quoted by the Abbé Pezron, I
think he has pretty well established the iact that the Curetes were Celtae, and that the
Olympic games were established by them;§ and this we shall soon find to be of
importance.
The following is a
very curious example of the Sanscrit in Greece; and when the
reader reflects upon the striking marks of identity between the Celtic and the Sanscrit
which he has just now read, there will be no necessity for me to make any observation.
The Arundelian marbles say, that Eumolpus, the Thracian; introduced the Elen-
sinian Mysteries into Greece.
Lucian says,
"
It was strange that the Barbarians were excluded from the mysteries,
as Eumolpus, a Thracian and Barbarian, introduced them among the Atheniaus."||
At the conclusion of these mysteries the congregation was dismissed in these words:
KOFE OM HAZ'-".
The author is informed by a learned friend, that these words, which were not under-
stood by the Greeks, are pure Sanscrit; and are used at this day by the Blamins at the
conclusion of religious rites. They are thus written in the language ofthe Gods, as the
Hindoos call the language of their sacred books. "

answers to the obsolete Latin word via- ,~ it signifies change, course, stead, place, turn of
work, duty, fortune. It is used particularly after making libations in honour of the
Gods and Pitris. I have no doubt that these mysteries came from the same quarter
and by the same people who brought the Sanscrit language into Italy. It has been said
that they were brought by the Thracians from Egypt.
It is certainly possible that those mysteries may have come from Egypt; but I think
it much more likely that they came from the Hyper-boreans from whom their oracles
came, by the north, from the parent hive, whence the Hindoos acknowledge that they
drew all their learning. It is not very probable that the Thracians should be employed
as the carriers of those articles from Egypt to Greece, nor that they should bring them
in the Sanscrit form or dress. I beg my reader to look to the Map. Besides, the
Hindoo polity was certainly established long before the Greeks had any historical
accounts of their Eleusinian mysteries ; and after it was once established all emigration
certainly ceased. From the circumstances here detailed respecting these mysteries, I
think there is reasonable ground to believe them the oldest of which we have any record.
When the Greeks began to write histories they found them, but they knew not whence
they came. I do not believe that the Sanscrit system of letters was the first, but I think
it was much older than the religion of Brahma. Budda with his flat black Face and CUTQ
head, as yet seen in the temples,* preceded Brahma by a
long series of years.
Although I may probably be thought to bestow more labour than necessary in demon-
strating a demonstrated ihct, yet I cannot refrain from repeating the observation which
the Abbe Pezron1' makes, after quoting the admission of Plato, in his Craig/lus,
"
that
many Greek words are only to be found amongst the Barbarians ;" that the Celtic words
from which he contends the Greek are derived, are more simple than the Greek ones, as
most of them are no other than monosyllables, whereas the others are
dissyllables: but
that, if any of the Celtic words be so, they are so
very seldom. It is, therefore, as he
says, plain enough, that the Greek words have been taken from the Celtic, and not the
Celtic from them: for it is a
general rule in almostall languages, that the longer and
larger words are derived from the shorter and more simple ones. When in addition to
this, the reader considers the circumstances ofthe oracles, mysteries, games, &c., of the
Greeks and Italians derived from the Barbarians, which he will see explained more at
large by and by, I have no
great fear of his continuing to entertain the superannuated
prejudice, that the Celtic words were derived from Greece or Latium.

THE TERM BARBARIANZQCHAP. II. SECT. XXIX.
Before I proceed, I must make a few observations on the word barbarous or barbarian.
This word has been much misunderstood by us. We adix to it the ideas of uncivilized,
unpolished, cruel; but this is a translation which leads to much error. The ancients
affixed no such meaning to it. Certainly when they spoke of strangers who were un-
civilized, the meaning would of course attach to it ; but the word was
applied to learned
strangers as well as to the unlearned. It meant strangers, either barbari or not baréari.
Thus Tibullus: "
Barbara Memphitem plangere docta bovem." Again, Martial:
"
Barbara pyramidum sileat miracula Memphis." Again, Thucydides calls the war
carried on with strangers Bagéhgav womans. Thus St. Paul, in the iirst Epistle to the
Corinthians says,
"
If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that
speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian to me."*
Virgil was a Celt and so was Gnipho, the praaceptor of Cicero, and many other
men amongst the Romans of whom we read, without ever suspecting them of being un-
civilized in our sense-barbarians. Divitiacus, the friend of Caesar, was a
king and a
Druid, and according to all appearance as little of a barbarian, in the vulgar meaning of
the word barbarous, as the elegant Caesar himselil
Cicero thus writes of the Gauls in his third Phillip.:
"
Ne vero de virtute, constantis,
gravitate, provincia: Gallica-z taceri potest. Est enim ille flos Italie, illud firmamentum
imperii Romani; illud ornamentum dignitatis."~|'
Having thus shewn the original seat of man, after the last flood, to have been in the
country East of the Caspian Sea, we have a
right to suppose that the dispersion of the
species, to any great distance, would not take place till it had increased to a
very great
number. The colonies, probably, would be all at first namade or
shepherd tribes : some
would continue thus a long time; others would settle themselves and build cities.
Some we know have continued in the same state to this day: the Arabians, for in-
stance. Abraham was at the head of a tribe which did not settle till after it had con-
quered Palestine under Joshua. The peninsula of India would be one of the Erst
peopled countries, and its inhabitants would have all the habits of the progenitors of
man before the flood, in as much perfection or more than any other nation. Whatever
knowledge was retained by the persons who were saved, would probably be found here,
as well as many of the habits, manners, and religious rites, of the earliest of mankind,
In short, whatever learning man possessed before his dispersion and survived it, may be
expected to be found here; and of this, Hindustan aifords innumerable traces, notwith-
standing all the perhaps well-intended but nonsensical and fruitless eB'orts of our priests

to disguise it. And now I wish to ask the serious and candid unbelieving philosopher,
what objection he can have to the nations having brought with them some of the cus-
toms or
learning which they possessed before the flood? I assume, that he believes in
A flood, for it is absolutely impossible that he can doubt it. We will leave this fm- his
consideration, but we will return to it on a future distant day. We must new rake
some long journeys with our Celtae.
THE CELTIC THE FIRST SWARM FROM THE PARENT HIVE.=CHAP. II.
SECT. XXX.
If the Unbeliever will not admit the Mosaic account of the deluge, he must admit,
upon his own
principles, that it was possible on that great event taking place, that a
part of mankind might have escaped on the most elevated grounds: and where are
they
to be found but where I have placed the second creation, as we may call it, amongst the
mountains of Bactriana., the ancient Imaus, or what may be called a continuation of the
Himmaleh mountains ?
After the first persons w o s
ge ,
the highest known mountains in the world, then called Imaus, Ararat, or Armeni, and
had increased to a
very great number, I suppose that a
dispersion took place. In con-
sequence of some cause, no matter what, the hive casted and sent forth its swarms.
One of the largest, represented by the book of Genesis to have descended from Gomer,
the eldest son of Japhet, took a direction North, then Westwards, nearly along the
forty-fifth palallel of North latitude. At first, of course, it would not go very far; but
aftera time it would be pressed on
by succeeding swarms, and, in consequence, would
advance along nearly the same parallel of latitude, between forty-live and fifty degrees,
until at last it would arrive at the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and would ultimately
_ .
. .
1
send forth swarms, either little or great, to colonize Britain. During the vast ength
of time that this was
going on, it would itself cast its swarms in diferent directions ; but
the southern ilank of its line of march. I re-
h urvived the delu had descended from those mountains
chiefly, on account of the climate, on
quest my reader to turn to the Map.

One swarm branched 06' through Sarmatia, and, inclining a little to the South,

under that name, and perhaps that of the Etrusci. Another advanced into Spain, and
were called the Celtiberians."* As it is evident that the circumstances under which
there emigrations or
irruptions would take place would be infinitely various, so of course
the effects would possess equal variety. It may also be observed, that probably as
these swarms of shepherds became more distant in time from their parent, they would
become more ignorant and barbarous. Shepherds make pretty subjects for poetry, but
no
shepherd tribe, whilst such, ever rose to a
high degree of civilization and refinement.
We shall have occasion to recur to this observation in our future inquiries.
SWARMS CAST OFF INTO THE SOUTH.-°CHAP. II. SECT. XXXII.
During the time that these Celtae were
migrating, as we have seen, of course other
great swarms cast oil' from the first hive on the southern side of the Caspian Sea, and
peopled the countries towards the south.
An original cast had no doubt advanced across the Euphrates, perhaps had been
pushed on
by fresh swarms until it arrived at the Mediterranean Sea: it there settled,
built cities, and formed Phaanicia: another no doubt had advanced into Arabia Felix. It
is evident that as soon as a swarm arrived on the sea-coast, as it could advance no
farther, its only chance of security would be to build towns to defend itself from fresh
tribes pressing upon it. I do not enter here into detail; it is unnecessary: but it
would be very easy to shew, that all this is in substance perfectly consistent with both
sacred and profane history. Thus it is that we generally find the traces of the parent
stock the strongest, in the first castoff swarms in the extremest points near the sea, and
this is what may naturally be expected. They would be the people possessing most of
the primeval habits and customs, and probably much more civilized than later swarms.
It is ditiicult to us, living in walled towns and roofed houses, to form a correct idea
of the moveable nature of the pastoral nations of the wrth, so many millions of whom
yet occupy the steppes of Asia, and ramble in the delightful plains of Arabia Felix, the

the circumstances in which tribes of this description are placed, they would notbe
surprised that they should be found in the remotest bounds of the earth. They would
naturally keep advancing as new tribes pressed upon them. As plenty of fine un.
occupied virgin pasture lay before them, when pressed, it would hardly be a
punishment
to advance,--to advance generally to finer climates and better pastures. It has been
observed, that the Western Celtae were an uuwarlike race, easily conquered by the
Scythians, &c. This was what might reasonably beexpected. The temperate nature
of their climate kept up their active habits; but, as
they never found enemies in the
countries they overran, they knew little of the use of arms. Thus they never
fought
till they could advance no farther, and were obliged to turn upon those who were
pressing them in the rear.
It may be objected to what has been said, as it has been objected to Pezron by D'
Haviland, that the Iones, the nation described as the posterity of Javan, or some other'
cast by a southern route, may probably have peopled Greece from Asia Minor, previously
to the arrival of the Celtaa in those countries. There is nothing in this against what I
have said. Probably swarms from the parent hive cast southwards, and, after arriving
at the boundaries of the land in Syria or Asia Minor, sent out colonies to people the
islands, or to pass over into Europe. And thus a
partial peopling of these countries
might take place, quite sumcient to give occasion to all the confused accounts of the
Greek historians, and to iiirnish a ground-work for episodes in their plays or
poems.
But I am of opinion that these very early colonies in their boats, must have borne no
proportion whatever in point of strength to the swarms of oriental Celtae.
Greek authors talk of the Titans, and say that the Celte descended from them. By
Titans some writers meant giants, others sons of the earth. I know nothing of giants
or sons of the earth; I class them all with Bacchus and Hercules. There are giants
most certainly in Jerom's Bible, and in our Bible; but there are none in the books of
Moses.
NOTHING T0 IMPEDE THE ADVANCE OF THE TRIBES.=CH. IX. SECT. XXXIII.
Give me leave to suppose for a moment with an unbeliever in the sacred character of
the Pentateuch, that the small remains of mankind, one
family only, had escaped from
THE or A flood (a Hood he must admit), on the top of the Imaus or the Himmaleh
mountains. After the whole surface of the land had been covered for a time with salt
Divine attributes in supposing, that when in the one, God thought proper to give a grand example of mecy and
benevolence, be should think proper to give in the other a grand example of retributive justice. The decmdsnts of
the pampered Isaac have known little but misery, imve become a by-word of contempt, the slaves of slave; but the
descendants of the outcast Ishmael in their lmlthy country, proverbial for its luxurie and happiness (Felix), have
walkerlwith heads erect. The world has bowed beneath their yoke, or trembled at their name ; but they sae have
either-bowed or trembled, and I hope and trust they nm.-rwill.

water, it would not be very prolific for some years, therefore it would not probably be
overrun with wood sufficiently to prevent the migration of tribes with their flocks; and
then, what is there to prevent such tribes as the Cimbri were in the time of Marius, from
of time? We have actual know.
removing to the extrernest West in no very long space
ledge, within the reach of history, of the surprising propensity of Gauls, Cimbri, Goths,
Huns, to migrate; then, why should not similar eB`ects have taken place still more early?
There is surely nothing extraordinary or unphilosophical in this.
If my reader will cast his eye upon the map, and at the ame time consider the ancient
histories of the countries which lie between the forty-fifth and fiftieth parallels of latitude,
he will instantly perceive that, nearly till the time of the Romans, the whole must have
continued a sheep-walk ;-not a
great city or settled country the whole way. If there
were walled cities, they were walls of waggons and houses of canvass. Consider only
the ease with which a Nomade tribe, with its flocks, would pass along the southern or the
central parts of France, in the summer seasons, for a series of years, if these countries
were unoccupied; and then a perfect idea may be formed of the trifling difficulties of the
first tribes in their advance. After once doubling the north point of the Caspian Sea,
they would not even meet with a
single chain of mountains of any consequence to impede
their progress. With the greatest ease they would steal down into Greece, and creep
between the head of the Hadriatic and the Alps into Italy; and between the Carpa-
thian mountains and the Alps into Gaul; scattering a few stragglers as they passed into
the beautifiil valleys ofthe latter, where traces of them in Druidical monuments and lan-
guage are occasionally found. Along the line here pointed out, they would have to pass
the rivers about the middle of their courses, where there would be no serious difficulty.
And seas there were none. The Nornade tribes, concerning which we have the best
information, generally changed their residence with the seasons; in the mountains in
the summer, and in the plains in winter.
They would naturally always keep inclining towards the southern sun, and this would
cause them in succession to send od' subcasts to occupy Greece, Italy, Spain, and Gaul.
Now look at the other line through Media, Assyria, Asia, which soon became thickly set
with strong cities, and contemplate the seas and mountains to be passed, and then, I
think, there will not be much doubt as to the line by which the great mass of population
flowed into the Western countries. The very warmth ofclimate of the Asiatic route would
operate against continual migration,-would produce habits of indolence and a
tendency
to settle and to repose ; and we may be very certain, that if any ofthe swarms took by
mistake a
wrong direction, to the north instead of to the south, they would, sooner or
later, find their mistake, and endeavour to correct it.° When they got into Italy, or
'
When we read of an irruption ofthe Celts into any country, we generally find them distinguished by a number
of different name. Thus, about six hundred years before Christ, they assed the Rhine into Germany, and wen
called Biturgies, Senon , Boii, &c. This shews thai, like the ancient Israelites and present Arahians, theywere

Greece, to Cuma or Delphi, they employed themselves upon recovering the lost arts of
their ancestors,-making statues or Etruscan vases; they willingly moved no more; bug
if they happened to lose their way, and by mistake to go to the North-we will now see
what they did.
EXAMPLE Ol' THE CIMBBI.*CHAP. II. SECT. XXXIV.
I shall now present the reader, from the spirited pen of Dr. Percy, the Bishop of Dro-
rnore, with the history of an attempt of the Cimbri, the colonisers of North-umberland,
C imber or Cumber-land, and the banks of my county river Umber,* to correct their mis-
take when they happened to travel to the North instead of the South, then he will see
how these tribes proceeded upon these occasions. It will, I think, enable him to form a
more correct idea of the character of these Nomads wandering tribes, and of the nature of
their emigrations, than any thing that I can
say. Besides, it is a well-known, established
history, of which we happen to have a hill account, and cannot be disputed. It is just
what we know took place amongst these very Celtas many times before; the first of
whom, finding the countries unoccupied, settled and established themselves and their
patriarchal customs, and were called by later settlers Aborigines. As may be ercpected,
in the country which they had occupied, many remains of their priests are to be found.
(See Plates 22 and 23.) Circumstances of this kind account for the remains of Druids
in various parts of Germany, where Cesar says they had no
priests or Druids. The
Cimbric Chersonesus or Holstein, were they had settled, was far from an agreeable girua.
tion, and its boundaries limited on every side.
. . . . . . The history of Rome-|~ informs us, that in the consulship of Csecilins Metellus
and Papirius Carbo, about one hundred and eleven years before the Christian mra,1 the republic
was agitated by intestine divisions which already began to threaten its liberty, when the intrigues
of the several factions were all at once suspended by the sudden news of an irruption of Barbarians.
More than three hundred thousand men, known by the name of Cimbri and Teutones, who chiedy
divided into tribes. A remnant of this custom has remained to our time in the mountains of Scotland. Suppose the
Highland chieiiains determined to invade England, we should read, that the Scottish Highlanders invaded England,
that they consisted ofthe Campbells, the M'Gregon, Sec. Sac.; but though they an
Campbells, Src., yet they are all
Scots. In consequence of this, from time to time, we read in ancient history of these swarms, under various names,
attacking different settled countries, and committing drmdful devsstations, in fact, upon their former friends, civilized,
settled, and forgotten. The buming of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, in Greece, is one example of this; the bum-
ing'ofBome,whenthestatewasmaHtobam.vedbyaman¢alledCami1lus,banother.

I believe the Umbri and Cimmerii of Italy were nothing but Cimbri or Cumbri, and Umbria got its name like
the river Umber and North-umber-land.

issued from the Cimbric Chersonese and the neighbouring islands, had forsaken their country to
go in search of a more favourable climate of plunder and glory...... Terror every where
went before them, and when it was
reported at Rome, that they were
disposed to pass into Italy,
the consternation there became general. The senate despatched Papirius Carbo with an army to
guard the passage of the Alps, deemiug it a sumcient degree of good fortune, if they could but
preserve Italy from these formidable guests. But, as they took a diferent route, and stopped some
time on the banks of the Danube, the Romans resumed courage, and condemning their former
feara, sent in a menancing tone to the Cimbri, to bid them take care not to disturb the Norici, their
allies. At the same time, the Cimbri being informed that a Roman army approached them, and
respecting the character of the Republic, sent ambassadors to the Consul Papirius,
"
to excuse
themselves, forasmuch as having come from the remote parts of the north, they could not possibly
know that the Norici were the allies of the Romans 5" adding,
"
that they only knew it to be
a received law among all nations, that the conqueror hath a right to whatever he can acquire: and
that the Romans themselves had no other pretensions to most of the countries they had subdued,
than what was founded on the sword. That they had, however, a great veneration for the Roman
people, on account of their virtue and bravery; in consideration of which, although they knew not
what it was to fear, they consented to leave the Norici in peace, and to employ their valour in some
other quarter, where they could do it without incurring the displeasure of the commonwealth."
Satistied with so moderate an answer, the consul sudered them quietly to remove; but when the
Cimbri were retired into Dalmatia, and expected nothing less than hostilities from the Romans,
a
party of these, commanded by Carbo, surprised them by night, asleqz and unarmed. These brave
warriors, full of indignation, flew to their arms, and defended themselves with so much intrepidity,
that they wrested the victory out of their enemies' hands, and forced them to seek their safety by
Right. But although the Romans almost all escaped the vengeance of their enemies, this defeat
was not the less fatal to the republic; for the splendour and reputation which it added to the arms
of the Cimhri, drew on all sides under their banners such nations as were either impatient of the
Roman yoke, or jealous of their incroachments: particularly the Tigurini and Ambrones, two peo-
ple originally of I-Ielvetia. With these new auxiliaries, they overwhelmed Gaul* a second time,
and advancing to the foot of the Pyrenees, endeavoured to establish themselves in Spain: but
meeting with a vigorous repulse &om the Ccltiberians, and tired of so many unprofitable invasions,
they sent a new embassy to the Romans, to oier them their services, upon condition they would
give them lands to cultivate. The senate, too prudent to enter into any kind of accommodation
with such dangerous enemies, and always divided among themselves about the distribution of lands,
returned a direct refusal to their demand. Upon which the Cimbri resolved to seize by force what
they could not gain by intreaty, and immediately fell with so much fury upon the new Consul
Silanus, who had received orders to march against them, that they forced his intrenchments,
pillaged bis camp, and cut all his army in pieces. This victory was soon after followed by another,
which their allies the Ambrones gained over Cassius Longinus, at the mouth of the Rhone : and to
complete the misfortune, a third army of Romans, more considerable than the two former, was soon
after entirely defeated. Scaurus, who commanded it, was made prisoner, and aherwards put to
death ; his two sons were slain, and more than fourscore thousands of the Romans and their allies
were left dead in the held. Last of all, two other generals, the Consul Manlius, and the Proconsul

Csepio, to whom had been intrusted a fourth army, already half vanquished with fear, and who
were disunited and jealous of each other, were attacked near the Rhone, each of them in his
camp, and entirely defeated.
Such repeated losses filled Rome with grief and terror, and many began to despair even of the
safety of the state. In this melancholy conjuncture, minds less firm than those of these spirited
republicans, would doubtless have suggested the imprudent measure of granting to the conqueror;
conditions capable of softening them: they would have given them at once the lands they had
required, or perhaps have purchased their friendship with a sum of money. This dangerous poliey
would probably have ruined Rome in this exigence, as it did some ages after. The Gauls, the
Germans, and the Scythians, poor and greedy nations, who grasped after nothing but slaughter and
booty, roving and warlike, as well by inclination as
necessity, would have harassed by continual
inroads a people which had let them see that they were at once richer and weaker than themselves.
The prudent lirmness of the Senate, and the valour of Marius, saved Rome for this time from the
danger under which it afterwards sunk. All the citizens now tumed their eyes towards the con-
ueror of Jugurtha, as their last and only support. They decreed him consular honours for the
Q
fourth time, and associated with him Catulus Luctatius, aperson scarcely inferior to him in military
skill, and who far excelled him in all the other qualities which make a
great statesman.
Marius having quickly discovered that the ill success of his predecessors was the elfect of their
imprudence, formed to himself a very different plan of conduct. In particular, he resolved me gp
join battle with the enemy, till their furious ardour was abated, and till his soldiers, familiarized to
the si ht of them should no longer consider themselves as
conquered before they came to blows,

Their former victhries, their tallness of stature, rendered still more terrible by their dress, their
f rocious air their harbarous shouts, and unusual manner of lighting, had all contributed to strike
9 2
the Romans with the greatest terror; and this terror was the Erst enemy he had to encounter, an
enemy which time alone could subdue. With this view, Marius judged it necessary to encamp on
th banks of the Rhone, in a situation naturally advantageous, where he laid in all sorts of pm-
e
visions in great abundance, that he might not be compelled to engage before he saw a convenient
opportunity. This coolness of the general was regarded by those Barbarians as a mark of cow-
ardice. They resolved, therefore, to divide themselves into dilferent bodies, and so penetrate into
Italy. The Cimbri and Tig-uriui went to meet Catnlus; the Ambrones and Teutones* hoping to
provoke the Romans to Bght, came and encanlped in a
plain full in their front ; but nothing could

intrenchments ; but here they were repulsed w|th loss: upon which they resolved to abandon their

camp and attempt an irruption into Italy. They tiled oil' for six days together in the presence of
Marius's army, insulting his soldiers with the most provoking language, and asking them if they
had any message to send to their wives, whom they hoped soon to see. Marius heard all these
bravados with his accustomed coolness; but when their whole army was passed by, he followed
them as far as Aix, in Provence, harassing their rear-guard without intermission. When he was
arrived at this place he halted, in order to let his soldiers enjoy what they had ardently desired so
long, a
pitched battle. They began with skirmishing on both sides, till the ight insensibly grow-
ing more serious, at length both armies made the most furious attacks. thousand Ambrones
advanced first, marching in a kind of measure to the sound of their instruments. A body of Ligu-
rians, supported by the Romans, repulsed them with great loss: but as they betook themselves to
ilight, their wives came forth to meet them with swords and hatchets in their hands, bitterly
reproaching them, and, striking indiscriminately friend and foe, endeavouring to snatch with their
naked hands the enemies' weapons, maintaining an invincible firmness even till death. This irst
action raised the courage of the Romans, and was the prelude to a
victory still more decisive.
Alter the greatest part of the Ambrones had perished in that day's action, Marius caused his
army to retire back to his camp, ordering them to keep strict watch, and to lie close without
making any movement; as if they were aifrighted at their own victory. On the other hand, in
the camp of the Teutones were heard continual howlings, like those of savage beasts; so hideous,
that the Romans, and even their general himself; could not help testifying their horror. They
notwithstanding lay quiet that night, and the day following, being busily employed in preparing all
things for a second engagement. Marius on his part, took all necessary precautions; he placed in
an ambuscade three thousand men, commanded by Marcellus, with orders to attack the enemy in
the rear, as soon as
they should perceive the battle was
begun. When both armies were come
within sight of each other, Marius commanded his cavalry to dismount ; but the Teutones hurried
on by that blind impetnosity which distinguishes all barbarous nations, instead of waiting till the
Romans were come down into the plain, attacked them on an eminence, where they were advan-
tageously posted. At the same instant, Marcellus appeared suddenly behind with his troops, and
hemming them in, threw their ranks into disorder, so that they were quickly forced to By. Then
the victory declared itself entirely in favour of the Romans, and a most horrible carnage ensued.
If we may tal-re literally what some of the Roman historians* have related, there perished more than
a hundred thousand Teutones, including the prisoners. Others content themselves with saying,
that the number of the slain was incredible; that the inhabitants of Marseilles for a long time after,
made inclosures for their gardens and vineyards with the bones; and that the earth thereabouts
was so much fattened, that its increase of produce was
prodigious. Marius, loaded with glory, after
a victory so illustrious in itself, and so
importaht in its consequences, was a filth time honoured
with the consular fasces; but he would not triumph till he had secured the repose of Italy, by the
entire defeat of all the Barbarians. The Cimbri, who had separated themselves hum the Teutones,
still threatened its safety. They had penetrated as far as the banks of the Adige; which Catulns
Luctatius was not strong enough to prevent them from crossing. The progress they made still
caused violent alarms in Rome; Marius was
charged to raise a new army with the utmost speed,
and to go and engage them. The Cimbri had halted near the Po, in hopes that the Teutones, of
whose fate they were ignorant, would quickly join them. lfVondering at the delay of these their

associates, they sent to Marius a second time, to demand an allotment of land, sullicient to main-
tain themselves, and the Teutones their brethren. Marius answered them, that "
their brethren
already possessed more than they desired, and that they would not
easily quit what he had assigned
them." The Cimbri, irritated by this raillery, instantly resolved to take ample vengeance.
They prepared immediately for battle, and their king or general, named Bojorix, approached the
Roman camp with a small party of horse, to challenge Marius, and to agree with him on a
day and
place of action. Marius answered, that although it was not the custom of the Romans to consult
their enemies on this subject, he would, notwithstanding, for once
oblige them, and therefore ap-
pointed the next day but one, and the plain of Verceil for their meeting. At the time appointed,
the two armies marched thither; the Romans ranged themselves in two wings: Catulus com-
manded a
body of twenty thousand men, and Sylla was in the number of his ofiicers. The Cimbri
formed with their infantry an immense square battalion: their cavalry, consisting of hfteen thou-
sand men, wa magnihcently mounted; each soldier bore upon his helmet the head of some
savage
beast, with its mouth gaping wide, an iron cuirass covered his body, and he carried a long halberd
in his hand. The extreme heat of the weather was
very favourable to the Romans. '1`hey had
been careful to get the sun on their backs, while the Cimbri, little accustomed to its violence, had
it in their faces. Besides this, the dust bid from the eyes of the Romans the astonishing multitude
of their enemies, so that they fought with the more confidence, and of course more courage. The
Cimbri, exhausted and dispirited, were quickly routed. precaution which they had taken to pre-
vent their being dispersed, only served to forward their ruin; they had linked the soldiers of the
foremost ranks to one another with chains; in these they were entangled, and thereby exposed the
more to the blows of the Romans. Such as could ily, met with new dangers in their camp; for
their women, who sat upon their chariots, clothed in black, received them as enemies, and massacred
without distinction their fathers, brothers, and husbands: they even carried their rage to such a
height, as to dash out the brains of their children ; and completed the tragedy, by throwing them-
selves under their chariot wheels. After their example, their husbands in despair turned their arms
against one another, and seemed to join with the Romans in promoting their own defeat. In the
dreadful slaughter of that day, a hundred and twenty thousand are said to have perished ; and if
we except a few families of the Cimbri, which remained in their own country, and a small number
who escaped, one may say, that this fierce and valiant nation was all mowed down st one single
stroke. This last victory procured Marius the honours of a
triumph, and the services he thereby
rendered the commonwealth appeared so great, that he received the glorious title of third founder
of Rome.
'
Thus have we given in a few words what historians relate of the expedition of the Cimbri; it
drew upon them for a moment the attention of all Europe. But as literature and the line arts can
alone give lasting fame to a nation, and as we easily lose the remembrance of those evils we no
longer fear, this torrent was no sooner withdrawn within its ancient hounds, than the Romans them-
selves lost sight of it, so that we scarcely lind any further mention of the Cimbri in any of their
writers. Straho only informs us, that they afterwards sought the friendship of Augustus, and sent
for a present a vase, which they made use of in their sacrifices ; and Tacitus tells us, in one word/
that the Cimbri had nothing left but a celebrated name, and a reputation as ancient as itwas
extensive.

REFLECTIONS ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE CIMBRI.*'CHAP. II. SECT. XXXV.
From this account it appears, that the Celtae wanted a settlement in a better climate
than that they had left. If they had not been prevented by the circumstance that the
countries through which they had passed were those of their friends, their cousins, there
can be no doubt that they would have settled on the Upper Rhine or the Danube, or
turned on one side to the beautiful Loire. The Romans reprobate their barbarism, but
the facts which escape,-their magnificent armour,-their negociation,-their adhe-
rence to the faith of treaties, Src. &c., prove, that they deserved not our appellation of
Barbarians ; but that, of the two, the epithet was more justly due to their enemies. Dr.
Percy permits himself in part to be deluded by the misrepresentation of the Romans, and
repeats what they say respecting the ravages committed in Gaul. A little attention to
the circumstances which escape, prove that they did not make an indiscriminate ravage,
but the appearance is rather the contrary-that they passed peaceably through, like the
Israelites of old, in search of a new habitation, unoccupied lands. The story of the
women dashing out the brains of the children, is merely a copy of the misrepresentations
of the Romans, to justify their slaughter of the women and children, and is not worth
a moment's attention.
What can he more like the irruption of Joshua and his six hundred thousand fighting
men into the land of the Canaanites or Phmnicians? Both tribes had been resident many
years; several generations; when, with one consent they rose up and walked away.
Many similar events are to be found in the history of the Celtic tribes. The author
remembers some years ago, in the time of Catherine, reading accounts in the papers of a
large tribe of some kind in Russia, having in like manner made preparations for a removal,
when being discovered before they commenced their march, the empress sent a
large army
to compel them to remain quiet.
It has been alleged, that the horde of Barbarians here exhibited giv but a bad sample
of the patriarchal Celtaa. This is very true; but it would be very absurd to draw any
conclusion against the ancient Gomarians of the East, from whom the Cimbri descended»
from the reduced state in which the latter are found after experiencing all the vicissitudes
of a
shepherd and wandering tribe for thousands of years. How can any one be sur-
prised at this, who considers the well-known fact, that the Bramins lost the principles of
their sublime astronomy, although they never stirred from the precincts of their magnifi-
cent temples ? But descend into the tumuli of the ancient Etruseans,-Etruscans buried
long previously to the foundation of Rome, or of the birth of the iine arts in Greece-and
contemplate the beautiful painting and grouping of the figures on their elegant vases;
and then you will see something probably much more in keeping with the character of
the mighty nation of Upper Asia, the inventors of the Neros and the Metonic Cycle,
axrsrnrrca or as ascrsur su-xox.-cr-ur. rr. sacr. xxxvr. 77
when it first sent forth its colonies into the Western world. When we look deeper into
the history of these wandering tribes, we shall find another circumstance to have taken
place which is not of a nature to surprise us much. The shepherds, the people themselves,
seem to have descended into a state of ignorance and barbarism, out of all proportion to
the character of the priests. Unfortunately the system of priesthood which arose, cori-
stantly tended to produce a division of society into two orders, the one
ruling and privi.
leged, and the other degraded and enslaved, subservient to the gratification of the former.
REASONS AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF AN' ANCIENT NATION NOT VALID.
CHAP. II. SECT. XXXVI.
It has been alleged against the existence of such a
people as I here contemplate in
Bactriana or the neighbouring country, that we do not find the remains of them as we
ought to do. I think there is not much weight in the objection. We know of many coun-
tries which have been highly peopled, with fine towns and cities, scarcely a remnant of
which is now to be found. Many of the cities of the Persians, Assyrians, and Canaanites,
which certainly existed, are now sought for in vain. What has become of the cities of
the Pontine Marsh, described by Pliny? By accident we see a few old stones, by which
we discover where the famous Capua stood. The situation of Veii fiirnishes a fine sub
ject of dispute to Roman antiquarians. And some
persons have thought that they could
discover the remains of the magnificent city of Nineveh. It is now not quite 2000 years
since the cities of Egypt were in their glory under the beautiful Cleopatra. Alas! where
will they be in 2000 years more? But the Romish missionaries, M. Baillie says, report
that there are the remains of large cities in the countries here spoken of; and all the nor-
thern part of India is full of the remains of a
great people. What are the caves of Elora
and Salcette ? What there may be in the upper part, about Balk, we know not: nearly all the
attempts of our travellers to penetrate thither have failed. Thence it is, however, the wri-
tings of the Persians inform us, that all the learningof the world descended. There it was,
they say, that Zoroaster first constructed his famous orbicular caves, and thence it is,
that the histories of the Bramins say, they received all their astronomy, mythology, &c.,
all of which are assertions confirmed by the researches of Baillie!
From the situation of the country to the East of the Caspian Sea, it is not surprising
that the Greeks and Romans should have said little about it. Except when Alexander
made his hasty incursion into it, they seem to have had as little connexion with it, as
we have had with the interior of China; but it was well known to them, though for
the reasons just assigned, we hear little about it. Strabo'|' informs us, that about 250

that runs close to the confines of Margiana and Bactriana; alld that if WSS
bythe help
of these people, who were
very ancient, that he made himself master of the neighbouring
province called Parthia; and thence it was that his kingd0lI1» Whidl 520011142 Very
mighty, was called the Parthian empire. In the ancient map we find the city of Ma-
xacanda, the modern Samarcand; what is there, except the long period of time, to hinder
his city from having been the capital of the first nation after the flood? I know no
historical evidence against this which may not be traced to the Jews since the time of
Moses, and the gratification of their hatred to the Assyrians, in branding their capital
with the epithet ot`co1y'i¢szbn. Josephus is the principal authority; and the numerous
misrepresentations which his book exhibits, shew that he is never to be depended on
when he has any object to serve, unless he be confirmed by other testimony.
THE SCYTHIANS.-'CHA.P. II. SECT. XXXVII.
Mr. Pinkerton and several others have maintained, that these islands were
peopled by
Scythians or Goths, not by the Celtaa. It is very probable that a
great swarm from the
hive bearing the name of Scythians, may have arrived in Gennany, and come thence into
Britain. It' they did, they can
only be considered as a succession of the same race of
people. Indeed I have no doubt that they did come, and at a
very early period, so early
as not to have lost their first knowledge. They may have passed along rather a
higher
parallel of latitude than the Celtae, and that will account for their being in Germany
instead of Gaul. It seems reasonable to expect that from these great top mats, smaller
ones should be found branching 05' to diH`erent countries, and settling themselves. Thus
the Cimbri of Holstein would have been now found in some
part of Italy, if the Romans
had been so
impolitic as to have complied with their desire. The passage of these
Cimbri through the Gauls, their cousins, is precisely like the attempt of the Israelites
to pass peaceably through some of their cognate tribes. And similar events may have
probably taken place, which accounts for the odd mixture of the different tribes in distant
and remote countries.
Of the learning of the Scythians, we have a
very remarkable proof in the Melpomene
of Herodotus. "
Anacharsis, a. famous Scythian philosopher, went to Athens, to pay a
visit to Solon, and was much admired by the Greek lawgiver for his great learning and
extensive knowledge; but, because he affected the manners and customs of the Greeks,
when Anacharsis was ever mentioned, the Scythians would answer they knew nothing
of him." Zamolxis was a
Scythian; he and Abaris both wrote ofa place of happiness in
a future life.°

Col. Vallencey has proved, as clear as the sun at noon, that the ancient gods of the
Greeks and Romans came li-om the Hyperboreans. His anxiety to make out his case
has induced him to enter too minutely into the subject, till he becomes tiresome ; and no
doubt (that he may miss nothing) he has strained his etymologies to an extreme which
they will not bear, an/ren ta/ren by t/ienzselves, or detached from the circumstances attending
them. This has aH`orded to Mr. Ledwich and others an
opportunity to turn them into
ridicule. This they have done, because they feel themselves weak in argument. But as
every good cause and real truth is proof against ridicule, a
great part of Col. Vallencey's
doctrine has prevailed, and will prevail against all his opposers. It is the peculiar
character ofthe argumentum ad ridiculum, to be strong in the beginning, but weak in
the end. In spite of all divines may say, ridicule is the best of all the tests of truth:
and as soon as ever the diihculties which are in our Bible, but which are not in the
original, are removed out of it, by means of a new translation, our divines will imme-
diately agree with Lord Shaftsbury and me.
Amongst all the iizults laid to the charge
of these good gentlemen, they cannot be accused of being an obstinate and stifilnecked
generation.
It is said that the Scythians overran Asia. Nothing is more
likely. Look at the map.
Consider the example of the Cimbri, and of the Huns and Goths more lately, and then
deny, if you can, the feasibility of a swarm of half a million or a million marching down
between the two seas, and overrunning Asia. This easily accounts for the Scythians
being intermizzed every where. It is probable that the Celtaz and the Scyths were in
fact the same
people, who, from migrating to these Western parts at different times,
became known by diferent names. Eastern Scythia and Bactriana do not lie mr
asunder, if they be not the same countries.
ARRIVAL OF PHGXICIAN COLONIES IN IRELAND.-'Cl-IAP. II. SECT. XXXIX.
The Irish claim to have been colonies from Phmnicia; but it has been amrmed that
there is no ancient evidence, except that of the Irish records, that the Phoenicians ever
made any settlements in Ireland. This really amounts to no objection, when it is con-
sidered that all the records of the Sidonians and Tyrians have long since disappeared
from natural causes; that those of the Carthaginians were destroyed by the Romans;
and that afterward, Patrick or the monks followed, and destroyed all that they could lay
hands on: but the assertion is not quite correct.
80 ARRIVAL OF PHGNICIAN COLONIES IN IRELAND.-CH. ILSECT. XXXIX.
Gorijonides, in his book de Hannibalef says, that Hannibal conquered the Britains
who dwelt in the islands in the Ocean.
Selden was of opinion, that our islands were the Fortunate Islands of the Greeks.
I Tzetzes, who cannot be supposed to have any Irish prejudice, or esprit du corps,
saac
savs,
"
In oceano insula illa Brittania, inter Brittaniam illam qua: sxta est in Occidente,
`
th f ll
`
as.
et Thylen que ad Orientem magis vergit." Justus Lipsxus quotes e o owing p
sage from Aristotle :-" In mari extra Herculis columnas, insulam desertam inventam
fuisse, silva nemorosam, tluviis navigabilem, 6'uctibus uberem, multorum dierum na-
vigatione distantem, in quam crebo Carthaginienses commearint, et multi sedes etiarn
fixerunt; sed veritos primores, ne minis loci illius opes convalescerent, et Carthaginis
laberentur, edicto cavisse et pcena capitis sanxisse, nequis eb navigasse deinceps vellet."1'
Lipsius then expresses his opinion that this cannot apply to the Canaries, but to the
British islands only.* And in this I quite concur with Lipsius, who lived in the
+
twelfth century, in Germany, and therefore cannot be supposed to have been infected by
Col. Vallencey. In my opinion the question of the antiquity of Ireland has not been
judiciously managed. Colonel Vallencey and others have attempted a great deal too
much; and they seem to have begun at the wrong end. They ought first to have en-
deavoured to shew, by extemal Greek or Roman evidence, like that from Aristotle given
above, that there had been some communication or settlement of the Phoenicians made
in the country. This expedition from Carthage is said to have been commanded_by
Hannibal: that very name instantly, in the minds of most persons, will throw a degree
of discredit on the story. It will immediately strike them that Hannibal must have had
something else to do than to explore unknown countries; and thus the foolish, and in
fact deceitful, method of rendering the word, injures the object it means to serve.
Nobody can doubt that it was intended by the translator to mean the great Hannibal:
the mode of translation conveys that idea, when probably the original means no such
thing. Hannibal was as common a name in Carthage, as Walker or Wood in England.
I think the quomtion from Aristotle is enough, when combined with circumstanc which
have been noticed, and others which will be noticed, to satisfy any person, that there
was a settlement of the Carthaginians in Ireland, from whom many of their customs
and anti uities may have been derived. It is not unlikely that this may have been the Mi-
'I
lesian settlement, of which so much has been said. It may have consisted in part or in
the whole of Carthaginians from Spain, at that time under the yoke of Carthage. On the
passage above of Aristotle's, Lipsius observes, "

varurn insularum: quia multos dies navigatione impendet; neque probabile igitur

The marks of the patriarchal people certainly appear to be much stronger' with the
Irish than any other people of the British isles. This may have arisen naturally from the
same cause, which makes them stronger in the islands of Scotland, Icomkill, or Wales,
than in England, their secluded situation preserving them from admixture with foreigners.
Besides, it is probable that the colony brought from Carthage, under the Hannibal ot'
whom we have spoken, would tend to keep the Phoenician customs alive, if a former
Phoenician colony had arrived, instead of destroying them, as the influx of Romans,
Sazrons, &c., would tend to do in Britain.
ORIGIN OF THB IRISH PABLE8.~°CHAP. II. SECT. XL.
After a
very long and laboured article by Col. 'Vallencey to prove the Irish were de-
scended ii'om Armenia, he says,
"
My reader being now
prepared for the ancient history
ofIreland, we must observe, that the ancient Armenians and Magogian Scythians, from
whom the Irish descended, having been one and the same
people, both named Eirineach
and Ahiranach, it will not be surprising to find, that the transactions of their ancestors
in Armenia, being either handed down by tradition or records, have been mistaken ihr
the transactions of these in Eirin or Ireland; and the same of the expeditions of the
Scythians into Iran or Persia." Again:
"
The general disgust to the ancient history
of die Irish, has arisen from the ignorance of the translators, who, zealous for the an-
tiquity of their country, did not, or would not, see that the early periods of this history
related not to Ireland, but to those parts of Asia their ancestors came
from."1' This is
not very satisfactory.

Mede, Nineveh, &c., are introduced. Thus, admitting #hat there were Irish romances,
I very much fear that he has not taken suliicient care to distinguish the romances from the
histories. It would be no easy matter. We have yet, I believe, to leam whether the
the romance of Cuc/lullin. At all events we see the Irish
Bards did make the histories subservient to the purposes alluded to above, and it may
be very diiiicult to separate them. But this no more proves all the ancient history false,
than the work of Xenophon proves this ofthe history of Greece. Of the Grecian history
what say Quintillian and Strabo ?
Cyropsedia may not be like
The judicious Quintillian thought he passed not too severe a censure when he wrote Grcecis Hir-
loricis plerumqus poetice similem esse licentiam. And Strabo is yet more severe:
"
Though the
Greek historians have pretended to give a history of Cyrus, and his particular wars with those who
were called Messagetsa: yet nothing precise and satisfactory could ever he obtained, not even in
respect to the war. There is the same uncertainty with regard to the ancient history of the
Persians, as well as that of the Medes and Syriana: we can meet with little that can be deemed
authentic, on account of the weakness of those who wrote, and their uniform love offabla. For
Ending that writers, who professedly deal in hction without any pretensions to truth, were regard-
ed, they thought that they should make their writings equally acceptable, if in the system of their
history they were to introduce circumstances which they had neither seen, nor heard, nor received,
upon the authority of another person: proceeding merely upon this principle, that they should be
most likelyto please people's fancy by having recourse to what was marvellous and new. On this
account we may more safely trust to Hesiod and Homer, when they present us a list of demigods
and heroes, and even to the tragic poets, than to Ctesias, Herodotus, Hellanicus, and writers of
that class. Even the generality of historians who write about Alexander, are not safely to be
trusted: for they speak with great conidence, relying upon the glory of the Monarch whom they
celebrate, and the remoteness of the countries in which he was engaged, even at the extremities of
Asia, at a
great distance from us and our concerns. This renders them very secure, for whatis
referred to a distance is diicnlt to be confuted."
In another place, Strabo goes on in the same strain :
"
The writers, who must necessarily be
appealed to, were in continual opposition, and contradzbred one another. And how could it be other-
wise? For if they erred so shamefully when they had ocular proof, how could they speak with
certainty where they were led by hearsay?"*
The Irish histories have been most of them Elled with Iies and nonsense by their bards,
but it is impossible that they can be more corrupt than, by this account, were the his-
tories of Greece. I am quite certain, that all which I have advanced may be true, con-
sistently with the great leading points in Mr. Vallencey's doctrines. With respect to the
tri beof Scythians who, he thinks, came independently of the Celtae to Ireland, they may
readily have done that, and all the material part of what I have advanced may yet be true.

My great diliiculty with all the voyages of numerous swarms is in their ships. I cannot
conceive how these people, in any great numbers, could arrive in ships, made of wicker,
covered with bolg or cow hides. I can readily understand how they might thus page fmm
Gaul to Britain, or from Britain to Ireland, or indeed run
along any coast ;" bug ng( how
they were to pass great oceans.
When I read accounts of the colonies which certainly migrated to and from different
nations in the Grecian Archipelago and its neighbourhood, and consider the subject with
as much impartiality as I am able to give it, I see no reason to pronounce it more im-
probable that a
colony should have passed from Spain to Ireland, than fiom Greece to
Marseilles, or from Syria to Carthage or the straits of Gibraltar. Nor do I see
any
impossibility in this having taken place many centuries before the birth of Christ. This
by no means militates against the North of Ireland having been colonized from Britain.
Tacitus, in his life of Agricola,1' speaking of Ireland says,
"
Melius aditus portusque
per commercia et negotiatores cogniti--" It was better known by its trade and com-
merce, by its easy resort, and the goodness of its harbours than Britain. This we all
know to be perfectly true.
The Irish historical books have been liable to the same accidents that all other books
are liable to, and without pretending to give an opinion upon any one of them in par-
ticular, I may venture to say, that the genuineness of no
very old book which has come
down to our times, would stand against such keen and often ill-tempered criticism as has
been launched forth against those of the Irish.
IRISH BARDS.*'CHAP. II. SECT. XLI.
All the Irish, Scotch, and Welsh accounts agree in the substantial part of the history
ot' the Bardic institution. One of the most renowned of the kings of Ireland has been
much celebrated for his establishment or regulation of the order. A great school or col-
lege of these people was established by this King, and every chieftain had one or more of
them to record the history of his clan. At the time alluded to above, in Ireland, they
were ordered to collect the ancient records of the country, and to these Bards in fixture
was entrusted the care of preserving them and ofcontinuing them. To this source I look
for the origin of all the long stories of Armenian inmigrations, &c., &c. That colonies
from Asia did arrive I cannot doubt, and for the filling up of the threadbare narrative of
the adventures of these people, with all the embroidery ofthe ancient Greek and Roman
historians, I look to this establishment of the Bards. It is well known, that in Iona, in
very ancient times, a
great collection of books was made. The Irish say the same thing

took place in their colleges or druidical monasteries in several parts of Ireland. What
happened in one
place might readily happen in another. There is surely nothing impro-
bable in this. Every one knows how the learned have regretted the dispersion and con-
sequent destruction of the library of Iona, in the stormy periods ofthe Reformation. The
nnhappy state ot' Ireland for the last two thousand years, is quite enough to account for
the destruction of their institutions similar to that of Iona, and of most of their manu-
scripts. It is from the Irish manuscripts that we learn the particulars of the institu-
tion or
regulation of the Bards to which I have alluded, and therefore to this the Irish
gentlemen cannot object. Then I ask, How can any thing be more probable than that a
set ot' men, constituted for such an object, should flatter the vanity of their employers, by
making up the histories in the way in which we End them in their old languages ? In-
deed, Col. Vallencey admits the fact. They were poets laureate; they would not have
got their sac/e if they had not pleased their employers. They were men of leisure, whose
bread depended upon singing their song to such tune as suited the taste of their heaters.
The similarity which these men would find out between their Gods and those of the
Asiatics who traded with them, would naturally draw them to a consideration of their
common descent, and it seems
very natural that they should endeavour to account for it
by having recourse to such books of foreigners frequenting their shores as
they could ob-
tain. Now I can entertain little doubt, that if the manuscripts were all faithfully trans-
lated, a
moderately good critic would be able to point out those which were the most
ancient; and as
(if I be right in my theory) the writers must have availed themselves of
such ancient histories as
they could get, either in Iona or elsewhere, they may have used
such as have not come down to us, and from this source it is possible that chasms in
our histories might be supplied, apparent contradictions reconciled, or errors corrected.
But something more I apprehend might come from this. It is allowed by the most
learned Hebrew scholars (for example Maimonides), that that language is in great part
lost. Now it is very certain, that the Hebrew and the Irish languages stand to each
other in no more distant relation than either grandchild and grandsire or second cousins.
And, perhaps, one may serve to explain the other. For example: Aos, in Irish, is a
tree, and it signifies knowledge; so in Hebrew yr; az ores is a tree.' When Moses
sent out to search the land, he bade them t|'y to find if there were
any XR az there: that
is, any learned men ; whether in Fact they were civilized; not ii' they had mood in the land.
This is confirmed by the Talmudists, who say, that the reply was not as our text has it,
that there were giants, but that there were men of learning (their meaning of the word
Arpkim) in the country.-|-

A few years ago, Mr. O'Connor published a work, in two large volumes, from Irish
manuscripts, which were
deposited for public inspection, for some time, in London. It
purports to be a chronicle ofthe Kings of Eri.
If these manuscripts be genuine and free from modern interpolations, they certainly
prove incontestibly all that Mr. Vallencey and Mr. 0'Connor contend for. But it is
much to be regretted, that we do not find with them a critical dissertation on the genuine-
ness and antiquity of the MSS., as well as a
complete history of them. I am
sorry to say,
that I think Mr.O'Connor's preface has hardly allowed them fair play. He ought to have
recollected that the public requires a most rigorous examination into all matters of this
kind.
Monsieur Gebelin, who is called by Colonel Vallencey a
great luminary of learning,
says, the Greek or
Pelasgian, before the time of Homer and Hesiod, sprung from the
Celtic, and fiom the same Celtic, the Latin and Etruscan; all facts which, I think, cannot
be disputed. The Colonel, Mr. O'Connor, and other Irish gentlemen, will not allow
this; they will have a separate pedigree and descent for themselves; they will not be
contaminated by Gaulish blood.'° But I think, if the reader will cast his eye on the
2nd Plate of Languages, p. 5, and compare the Etruscan and Greek with one another,
and the number and names of the letters of the Irish alphabets, he will not have much
doubt that they have all descended fiom a common
parent.
The circumstance of the Irish manuscripts being found in two diiferent alphabets, the
Bobeloth and the Bethluisnion, tends to confirm an
opinion that Ireland was settled by
two sets of persons at different times :T by one set
coming by sea., and bringing one
alphabet, and by another from Britain bringing the other, both carrying on their faces
evident marks ofa descent from a common ancestor.
Mr. O'Connor says,
"
The Cimmerii were the Aborigines of all the countries from
the Tanais to the German Ocean, of which, to the Cronus and the Theyss or
Tobiscus_
they were dispossessed by the Sarmatae and Scythians, and that, from thence to the Ger-
ma.n Ocean, between the Baltic north, and the Ister and Rhine south, they did continue
to possess and rule, as Cimmerii, Cimbri, or Germanni." And, "
That they were
neither descended from Gomer nor from Og, but producedfrom the elemerus of their
own
proper soil and ch`mate; as old as the hills and waters of their lands." '15
I quite agree with Mr. O'Conner that the Cimmerii were the first occupants of the
countries or of most of the countries which he describes; but I have a
very great dim-
culty about his mode of accounting for their being found there. I have no
experience of

mushroom-grown men. I am so difiicult to please, that even the history of the men
grown by the sowing of the teeth of serpents, by Cadmus, is not
quite satisfactory to me.
Indeed, so little is that story to my taste, that I have been induced to suspect one of the
usual mistakes of the Greeks in a Hebrew sentence, which ought not to have been ren-
dered, that he conquered by men produced by sowing teeth, but by men armed with spears
of brass, either of which expressions the unpointed Hebrew will bear. So that, as I am
in the habit of making dilliculties, I hope Mr. O'Connor will be kind enough to excuse
me for not quite liking his mode of peopling a country.
Mr. O'Connor's contrivance of converting the flood of Noah into a flood of Scythians
fiom the North, through the opening between the two seas into Asia, is as little to my
taste as his earth-grown men. That the Scythians did come down like a torrent we learn
both from Ezekiel and profane authors, and if Mr. O'Connor will have them to be a
flood, well; so let it be. But I am quite certain he cannot look at the cliffs of Dover,
nay, even into any common well or stone quarry, or read the extract from Cuvier, which
will be found in my fourth chapter, and not be convinced, that a
great and terrible con-
vulsion, attended with an immense flood, has taken place. Various floods have taken
place, but the last is that to which I allude, and that to which the book of Genesis
alludes. I shall return to Mr. O'Connor by and by.
Mr. Pinkerton seems to be of Mr. O'Connor's opinion. As these gentlemen are
obliged to allow that the Celtae occupied the countries before the Scythians, it is no bad
contrivance to make them grow there. The former says, "It is a self-evident proposition
that the Author of nature, as he formed great varieties in the same species of plants, and
of animals, so he also gave various races of men as inhabitants of several countries: a
b ll d or
Tartar, a
Negro, an American, &c. &c., differ as much from a German, as a u -
og,
lap-dog, or shepherd's cur, from a
pointer. The differences are radical, and such as no
climate or chance would produce; and it may be expected that as science advances, able
'
.II
writers will give us a complete system of the many different races of men. In this pas-
sage I think Mr. Pinkerton cannot be acquitted of a little dogmatism. Again, he says,
"
The latest and best natural philosophers pronounce the flood impossible; and their rea-
sons, grounded on mathematical truth and the immutable laws of nature, have my firll
assent."" I leave Mr. Pinkerton to the priests, with this single observation, that the
proof which Mr. Laurence gave in his fine Lectures ofthe error of Mr. Pinkerton's Erst
dogma, by demonstrating that the race of man did all descend from one pair,-was, in
fact, one genus and one species, ought to have saved him from the forfeit of his copyright,
which the Chancellor Eldon levied upon him, equal, I have been told, to .£2,000. Mr.
Laurence's Lectures are the best defence of the Mosaic system that has ever been
published.

l shall take little more notice of the Scythians, because I treat of a time before they
existed under the nume of Scythians ; and I am of opinion that nothing which has been
proved respecting them militates against any thing I have said or shall say. Much more
warmth has been displayed by Mr. Ledwich, Mr. Pinkerton, and Mr. Huddleston, upon
this subject, than, in my opinion, is in good taste. It seems
very extraordinary that
gentlemen cannot discuss such a
subject as this without losing their temper.

CHAPTER III.
DERIVATION OF THE WORD BB.ITAIN.*SECT. I.
As may well be expected, much trouble has been taken to ascertain the origin and
derivation of the word Britain. Mr. Toland supposes, that it was derived from a Gallic
king .galled B;-etannus, who had a
daughter called Celtina, with whom Hercules fell in
love. He argues that Britain was
peopled from Gaul, (which no doubt it was,) and
called from this king Britannus. The attention to this ridiculous story of Hercules is
not in Mr. 'I`oland's usual good taste; and if it were
repeatai in ahundred Greek
authors it would convey no conviction to my mind. It is perfectly clear that whenever
the Greeks met with any god, or tradition, or local superstition, or custom, which they
did not understand, instead of undertaking any rational inquiry or
etymological inves-
nrenzssron nzsrncrrne rn: anno cons.-caan. nr. szcr. rr. 89
tigation, they cut the matter short by inventing a
history, connecting it mostly with
something which was flattering to their own national vanity, generally to their own gods.
Their conduct is pretty well described by Strabo in the last chapter. Sir Walter Scott
has done this in his historical novels: and I am
strongly inclined to think, that many
ofthe Greek historians had no
higher object in view in their histories than Sir W. Scott
has in his works, acknowledged to be novels; and, on this account, they did not mn.
sider themselves as more culpable in the liberties which they took with truth, than he
does for those which he has taken in his works. If I be right in my supposition, it is
hardly fair to accuse an historian of mendacity in repeating such stories as the above
respecting Hercules and Bretannus, his daughter Celtina, and his son Celtus.
DIGRESSION RESPECTING THE HERO GODS.-CHAP. III. SECT. II.
Before I proceed further it is necessary to explain, that in no case can I for a moment
attend to the stories told of Bacchus, Hercules, 8tc., &c. Mr. Bryant has proved to a
demonstration, that all the gods of the ancients resolve themselves into one-the god
Sol, either as God, or as an emblem or Shekinah of the Divine presence. The learned
Cudzoort/1, in his inimitable fourth chapter, has proved, that all the enlightened and
learned of the Gentiles believed in one only God. And M. Dupuis, in his History of
all Religions, has proved, that all the different labours of Hercules, Bacchus, Theseus,
the Argonauts, with Jason and his Golden Fleece, are nothing but astronomical allegories.
It is necessary, therefore, to discard the nonsense of the travels, marriages, &c., of the
persons here alluded to. These stories were, generally, nothing but contrivances of the
priests to furnish a reason to their followers for circumstances which they found ex-
isting, and for which they could not account. In certain cases these histories are very
fill to inform us of collateral circumstances, or to teach us what was the prevalent
use
opinion at the time respecting them. For instance, from the story of Hercules having
married Celtina, the daughter of Bretannus, we
may conclude, that at the very earliest
periods the Celtae were probably resident in Gaul, and that in some way or other they
' `
far ba k
were closely connected with the Britons ; that, in iiact, such was the case as c as
the people who told that story had learned from history or tradition. From the story
of the Ogham language having been invented by Hercules, we may couclude, that the
language had been in use from time immemorial to the relater of the story. But the
fact of Hercules having invented it is all nonsense. There never was such a man as
ll be an ancient history worthy the perusal of a person of
common ilnderstanding, till we cease to take chronology and history from epic poems;
and till we send all the heathen gods and their goddesses back to the stars, whence we
may be perfectly assured that they never descended to the earth, but that they are every
M

and there never wi

one ofthem astronomical allegories, and that Hercules was not a hero deiiied for cleaning
a stable, or
frightening the birds from a lish-pond.'
DERIVATION OF THE WORD BRITAIN C0N'1'INUED.1CHAP. III. SECT. III.
But it is the more incumbent on us to omit no care in our endmvours to separate all
such chaB` from the good grain. I shall therefore pay no attention to what Toland says
about this king. The name of Britannia or Britain or
Bgafaumq, is evidently Greek. It
is in the Greek historians that we meet with this name: and it was probably derived by
them from some name or idea connected with the country, or from some word of the
country, or from both. It is very seldom that people call a
foreign and newly-discovered
nation by the name used by the natives; but generally christen it from some prominent
quality or
peculiarity, which it may possess or be supposed to possess. There can be no
doubt that the British isles were known to the ancient Phrenicians and Greeks, as Hero-
dotus called them Cassiterides or the countries qf tin ; and it was
chiefly on account of
the abundance of this, at that time scarce metal, that they were an object of attention.
This word is the Celtic Casse-lair, pronounced Cassiter, to which the Greeks added
their peculiar termination os, and formed Cassiteros. Casse-#air signifies the vulgar, or
base sheet or bar, to distinguish it from silver, which is called Airgad-i. e.
"
the pre-
cious sheet or
bar."'|'

WHITAKERJS naarvuros or ras: woan saturn.-cn. nr. ssc'r.rv. 91
From Bochart and Borlase I learn that the word Baratanae, in the phwnician tongue'
signifies a land qftin. The word stan or tan, as Pezron has observed, signihes in Celtic
a
region. Now I think that it was first called Baratanac or the country of tin, afterward
translated into Cassiteros by the Greeks, and also Britannia or
Bgr-rammg. It is in my
mind no objection to this derivation that only a small part of the island produced tin, It
is quite certain that the natives of Greece and Phoenicia at first would only know that it
was the land whence tin came. Whether it were
produced in every part of the country
or only in a small part, would not be an object of inquiry. 'I'he land generally, with its
islands, was called Britannia. The word tan was a common termination for the names
of countries, as Mauritania., the land of the Moors; Aquitania, the land of waters ; Lu.
sitania, Bastitania, Turdetania, &c., &c.'*
There is another derivation given by Mr. Borlase,1' which is ingenious and worthy of
consideration. He says,
"
It may not be amiss to refer it to the learned as a
thing to be
considered, whether the former part ofthe word Britain may not be found in the Hebrew
language, which, as we are well assured, is the ground of the Phoenician and ancient
Celtic."
"
In the British tongue there are many; some say800 Hebrew roots to be
found, which will make it not unlikely to find the root of Brit in that sacred language.
There 33brainPihal,signifies,tocutod'ordivide,andwiththeT1tadded(anusual bra in Pihal, signifies, to cut od' or divide, and with the T1 t added (an usual
termination ot' nouns derived froth verbs, as N13 brit, fmdus, &c.) will signify, a divi.
sion or separation; and doubtless this is the first idea that strikes us, when we
compare
the situation of Britain with that of its neighbouring countries on the continent, from
which it is so entirely divided :"

Mr. Whitaker gives the following derivation, which the reader will find before he has
th h this work is substantially the same as the last. "
The original word appears
gone roug
to have been equally pronounced Brict, Brits, and Bricth, Breact, Breac, and Brig; and
appears to be derived from the Gallic Bresche, a
rupture, the Irish Bris, to break, and
Brisead, a breach. And the word occurs with all this variety of termination in the Irish
Breattain or Breatin, Bretam, and in Breathnach, Briotnach, and Breagnach, a Briton;
in the Armorican names of Breton, Breiz, and Brezonnec, for an individual, the country,

call in the Greek 1-ana, for a
country, to our aid. And we must not with Pezron and
Carte adopt the equivalent Tain of the Celtic." Now here I disagree with Mr.
Whitaker, because I think the Greek 'fauna and the Celtic tain were the same word.
The -fauna derived from the Celtic tain. The word Brit I take to have been the
root, the same as the Hebrew 11121 brit, and all the rest formations from it; and its
meaning was, as Mr. Whitaker says, separated. I cannot agree with him that the tribe
of Brigantes, which we find in Yorkshire, Ireland, PORTUGAL, &c., has taken its name
from Brit, the separation of Britain from Gaul. I do not pretend to give the derivation
of Brigantes. It is often easier to say what a thing is not, than what it is ; but I cannot
allow Valencia in Spain, Evora and Brigantia in Portugal, to have taken their names
and to have been peopled from Britain.
I beg my reader not to forget that Evora or Ebora, the name of York, and Brigantia,
the country of the Brigantes, names of peninsular cities, are found in Yorkshire. Those
who deny the possibility of a
colony coming from Spain to Ireland, must account for this
similarity of names, here so very striking.
The Irish histories are iiill of accounts of the arrival of a
colony from Spain under
the command of a
person called Milesius. These are
strongly opposed by Ledwich
and Innes ; but after all that they say, there does certainly appear to be a
strong tra-
dition that a
colony did arrive from Spain in very early times. The possibility of such
a
thing cannot surely be denied. When it arrived, or in what force, are questions upon
which I shall not at present enlarge.
DERIVATION OF BRETAGNE IN GAUL.-'CHAIR III. SECT. V.
These derivations neither of them satisfactorily account for the etymologyof the Gallic
name
Bretagne on the opposite coast. It cannot be doubted that the origin of the name
of these two countries, such near
neighbours, both speaking, even unto this day, the same
language, must have been the same. When I consider the great number of casualties, or
of intermixture or intercolonization which may have taken place between the two coun-
tries in a vast series of years, I think it highly probable that some
emigration or
colony of the islanders may have returned from Britain to Gaul, and found shelter or
refuge, perhaps from their enemies, after their country had by means of the Greeks and
Phcenicians acquired the name of Britain. Or these latter landing from their ships,
and finding a
people similar to the Britains in language, and in general character, may
have given them the name by which they passed amongst Grecian and Roman histo-
rians, till they regularly-acquired the name in the country itself; conquered, it must be
recollected, by the Romans.

Some writers have pretended that it was conquered by the islanders when fleeing from
the Saxons; others by Constantine's discharged soldiers. These ggntlgmgn hav., nat
given themselves much trouble to inquire, or
they would have found it quoted by its
name of Bretagne by authors long before the time to which they allude. I think the
old story of Hercules and Celtina, the daughter of king Brelannus, is of itself enough to
settle this question. Dionysius Afer and Pliny also speak of the inhabitants of Bologne
by the name of Bretons. Mr. Cambry, (pp. 4-5-4-7,)notices many other amiga; authors
who have named them. It is fortunate that the question is of little moment, as it does
not seem likely to be settled. Not that learned men will admit their ignorance. Rather
than confess such a shocking thing, they will account for it as
wisely as
they accounted
for the word Beelzebub, whom they made lord qfyfies.
Ausonius names the people of Armorica or Bretagne, as connected with the worship
of Apollo, Bel, and the Druids, in a curious manner. He says,

Mr. Scawenf says, that Armorica received princes from Cornwall, and Cornwall from
it, and that mutual assistance was afforded, and that a
great intercourse of private families
took place. What authority Mr. Scawen had for this does not appear. Mr. Lhwydg
informs us, that "

with fable as to render them unworthy of credit, although they may, and probably do,
contain much that is true.*
DERIVATION OF THE WORD ALBION.-CHAP» III. SECT. YI.
I think Dr. Whitaker's derivation of the word Albion is very probable. He thinks
that this name was given to it by the Gauls, from iirst seeing its lofty white clgffr near
Dover; the word Alb meaning lofty in the Celtic language; on which account the Alps,
Apennines, Mount Albis, &c., got their names. From the white snow-clad tops of
these mountains it might in time acquire the meaning of while. The Highlanders of
Scotland are called Albanach, that is, when correctly translated, people of the HIGH
lands. It was called by British poets, Inis Wen, or the White Island; it is called by
Orpheus Aeuxwov Xaga-av, or the White Land. A7s4>og is Greek for white, Albus in
Latin.
Boeliartsays, that the Phmnicians called Ireland H81-'IJII abr-uae, that is, ultima habi-
tatio; and that 3553 Albin implies the East; whence Britain, to the East of Ireland,
was called Albion.
DERIVATION OF THE WORD DBUID.-CHAP. III. SECT. VII.
The meanings given to the word Druid are very numerous, but not more numerous
than nonsensical. The Greeks, as
every one knows, derived it from Apug, an Oak, fiom
the word Druid having a similarity to the Greek word Agug, and from their having their
worship in groves of oaks, trees which they were said to consider with profound reve-
rence, and to which they were
supposed to pay a low speci of adoration. But how
absurd to derive a word of an ancient language fiom a modern one! Besides this, the
word has been supposed to mean, a
revenger, cruel, valiant or
hardy, dear or
precious;
it has also been thought to be derived from the Celtic trewe, that is faith, or fiom drut,
a friend; others from the Hebrew Demssim, Drussim, or Drissim, that is, people of con-
templation; and the learned Keyslerf says, that Draoi, in the plural number Dlaioith,
signifies a
magician or enchanter. Magic was, in fact, very little more than the know-
ledge of astronomy. Druwydd, Drudau, Drudion, Drudon, and Derwyddon were
equally names of the Druids.§
Mr. Vallencey says,
"
Welsh Drud, a Druid, i. e. the absolver or remitter of sins; so
the Irish Drui, a Druid, most certainly is from the Persic dura, a good and holy man."}]

Ousely says,' "In the Arabic, deri means a wise man, which in Persian is darn, whence
English Druid." The word Druid being in substance found in all these languages is very
striking, and, I trust, my reader will not forget it.
The Romans, on
discovering Gaul and Britain, found an order of priests with fb;-mg
and ceremonies almost new to them, whose name, in the language of the country, was
Druids. This word they adopted instead of calling them priests; as, on
many accounm
the Druids did not answer to the description of priests, such as priests were with them;
they therefore adopted the Celtic word into their language, as
they did the word Magus
from the Persians, for a similar reason. The Celtic Irish word for Druid is Drui, cor-
ruptly Droi, and sometimes more corruptly Draoi, all having the same sound. In the
nominative plural it is Druidhe, whence comes the Greek and Latin Druides; as Druis,
in the singular, was formed by only adding .r to Drui, according to-their way of termi-
nating their words. According to their usual custom and the genius of their language,
they formed Druids: for female Druids.-f
The Druid of the Celtas answered in every respect to the Magus ofthe Persians. The
Celtic word for magician is Drui, and the magic art is called Druidhmcht, and the wand
or rod, which was one of the badges of their profession, was called Slatnam Druidheacht.;
Pliny§ confirms this and says,
"
the Gauls all their Magi, Druids."|| But a&er all the
ingenuity which has been bestowed upon the origin of the word Druid, I am
by no
means certain that the simple derivation of Mr. Davies ii'om Taliessin, the Welsh bard,
may not be the true one. The latter says, that it is a
compound word composed of the
Welsh, i. e. Gaelic or Celtic, word G-uzydd, a priest, and Dar, superior-superior priest
or chief-priest. And this may readily account for its being found in all these languages
and countries.
DERIVATION OF THE WORDS VATES AND BARDS.*CHAP. III. SECT. VIII.
Strabo1I divides the Druids into four orders, called Agus'6a.s, Druids, Oua-nig," Vates or
Prophets, and Bagioi, or Bards. Ammianus Marcellinus makes the same division.1-f
He says, "Posthaac loci hominibus parum exculti ingruere studia liberalium doctrina-
rum, inchoata per Bardos, Euvates, et Druidas;" i. e. Afterward, amongst the rude,
unpolished people, grew up the knowledge of arts and sciences, begun and set by Bards,
Euvates, and Druids. Then he proceeds to account for these three orders as Strabo before
him had done. Diodorus Siculus and Cicero have named another order of men called

96 DERIVATION Ol' THE WORDS VATE8 AND BARDS.-CHAP. III. SECT. VIII.
Saronides.* But Bochart and other critics have shewn that Druids and Saronides, being
Greek synonyms, were anciently taken to express the same thing. Of these Ammia-
nus, the resident of Marseilles in Gaul, who could not help knowing the truth, says,
"
The bards sung in well-made compositions, on their harps, the heroic acts of men; the
Euvates or Eubates, more deeply considering nature, made attempts to discover her
highest arcana and most secret workings; and amongst these the Druids, men of more
polished parts, as tlze authority qf Pythagor-as has decreed, aE`ecting formed societies and
sodalities, gave themselves wholly to the contemplation of divine and hidden things,
despising all worldly enjoyments, confidently aiiirmed the souls of men to be immortal."
These words of Ammianus are worthy of attention: "
Ut auctoritas Pythagora: decrevit,
sodalitiis astricti consortiisque." They seem to point strongly to the monastic institu-
tions of Pythagoras.
Mr. Vallencey says, "The Vates or Prophets, the last order of Druids, were called
Baidh, Faith, Faithoir, or Phaithoir. The first was written Vaedh by the Arabs, and by
the Greeks Ouateis. Baid is the Chaldaean bade, M: bda, przdicavit; DW; badim
divinatoressf The Irish Faithoir is the Hebrew 'mg ptr, to solve an aenigma."$
Pezron says,
"
The word Baid, in the Celtic language, means poet."§ The Eubages
or Vates were an inferior class of Druids, as is plain from the following expression of
Ammianus Marcellinus: Eubages scrutantes seria, et sublimia nature pandere canna-
bantur. Inter has Druidw ing-eniis ce1s£ores.[|
The word Bard, oRen written Barth, probably comes from the Hebrew or Chaldee
word D19 pri, to sing. They sung to the harp, in Hebrew 1133 cmtr, in Irish, cinur.
Diodorus and Ammianus describe the bards as singing to their harps. Mr. Vallencey
says, they were also called by the ancients, Saronides. Searthon, in Irish, is he who
sings, chants, or repeats in sail, i. e. recitative, and is called Searandon; the last sylla-
ble applying like our word Doctor.1I Mr. Vallencey would have been more correct
if he had said, "
like our word Lord." A-don is Welsh for Lord; the A probably being
emphatic, and Don, every one knows, is a
Spanish title of honour; and they both come
from the word Adonis, and the Hebrew word 'J78 ddni, Lord.
Diodorus Siculus lived a little after Julius Cesar; he says, the Saronides were the
Gaulish philosophers and divines, and held in great estimation; nor was it lawtiil to
perform any sacrifice without the presence of a philosopher.

'OTE APOTIAA2. To this, as Mr. Ledwich makes no objection, I suppose there is
none to be made.")
This text Mr. Ledwicli has taken much pains to
misrepresent. I think that the
words are perfectly clear, and the distinction between philosophers and divines marked.
By philosophers and divines he meant a divine skilled in philosophy. This is the fair
meaning ot' the words. And Mr. Ledwich's attempt to shew that philosophy amongst
the Greeks only meant theology cannot be admitted. Was the philosophy of Plato and
Aristotle nothing but the theology of the day? But Diodorus is confirmed by Strabo,
who intbrms us,1' that the Druids, besides the study of natural causes or
physics, cul-
tivated also moral discipline or ethics.
Pliny; says, The Druids are the Gaulish Magi. Porphyry§ says, The name

and were the ministers of the Deity.-OI mp: 'ro Sain n¢ai, nm 'refs

be natives of it, the maritime parts by those who crossed over from Belgium in Gaul in
rder to invade it, almost all of whom have their names from the states whence they
o
sprang, and on the ceasing of hostilities remained there." Tacitus also says, "All
circumstances considered, it appears probable that the Gauls possessed themselves of the
neighbouring country of Britain." Pliny and Dionysius Afer say, the Bretanni dwelt
in the remotest part of Gaul. These were the natives of Bretagne. Dion. Afer seems
to confound them with the Iberi.

And the fair-skinned tribe of' martial Germans.
It is pretty clear that the Gaulish Bretanni and the British were the same
people.
lt is also worthy of` observation that they were Iberians, or Iberi, or Oberi or Hebrews!
I shall shew who these Iberi were
by and by. This seems to countenance the history
ot' colonies from Spain or of Iberians coming to the British isles. Indeedl do not
see how this can be disputed.
Caesar must be allowed to be, in this instance, a disinterested witness; and he pro-
bably received his infomation from the natives, who had received theirs from tradition,
if' not from a better source, viz. records. The tradition, or the belief; in his day was,
"
that the maritime parts of' Britain were
chiefly inhabited by people from Gaul and the
Belgae, who called their new towns and habitations by the names of those places that
they had left."1~ This is clear and positive testimony; and if any person will look at
the maps of England, France, and Belgium, he will see evidence probable too. Let
him consider Cumberland, the river Humber, Evora, Brigantia, &c., &c.
Mr. Pinkerton has endeavoured to prove, that the Belga were Goths, and that, con-
sequently, Kent was peopled with Goths. This Mr. Huddleston has strenuously de-
nied: and he charges Mr. Pinkerton with several wilfully dishonest misquotations. I
think Mr. Huddleston has the better of' the argument; but-I can
hardly say that the
question is certainly decided, either one
way or the other. I think the Belgaa, when
they came to Britain, were
probably a mixed race, and neither strictly one nor the
other.1'
Belgic Gaul was no doubt first occupied by Celta-3. It is probable that they were
afterward conquered by a German tribe called Belgae, whence the country was called
Belgic Gaul, and the inhabitants became a mixed race. And thus, those who say the
inhabitants of that country were Celine, and those who say they were Germans, may
both be right; but the warmth of temper in which gentlemen indulge, will not give
them time to consider circumstances of this kind. A similar
misunderstanding has
arisen with regard to the Cimbri. Some say they were Germans; this is with
much animation denied by those who say they were Celtaa. The fact is, they were
Celica when they first came from the East, probably of the first tribe; but it is evident
that after they had resided in Holstein, or the Cimbric Chersonesus, a vast number of'
years, probably undergoing during such residence many casualties, they became Ger-

mans, and, in all likelihood, formed a
complete mixture, (like the inhabitants of Belgic
Gaul,) when they were defeated by Marius. Dr. Percy's account
evidently proves
that they cannot be called merely Teutones, bemuse in several places a marked distinc.
tion is made between these two clans or tribes.
Livy* says, that in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, about 600 years before Christ,
Ambigatus, king of the Celtae, finding his country over-peopled, sent out two
strong
colonies, one to the North, the other to the South, to seek new habitations. This is a
striking example of subcasts going oi? from the first great swarm.
MR. DAVIES'S OPINION OF THB FIRST SETTLERS.-CHAP. III. SECT. X.
Mr. Davies says, the Celtic nation at large may be regarded as
comprising a race of
two different characters, though sprung from the same
family. The one sort were those
who took peaceable possession of a
country which had not been previously inhabited.
There they supported the character ascribed in history to the ancient Hyperboreans,
establishing a national religion, the best calculated for securing peace amongst them-
selves, but which, till it was
gradually changed by political necessities, rendered its
votaries incompetent for the defence of their country, or the support of their national
independence.-The other sort were a
people who had less of scruple in their principles,
but who, having been inured to arms before they approached the West, and confiding in
their native prowess, forced their way into many possessions of their unresisting brethren.
In the Welsh, the Armoricans, and the Cornish, undisputed votaries of Druidism, we
recognise the former, and in the Irish or Highlanders, the latter of these two branches.
It is not at all necessary to suppose that where these people established themselves,
the others were either extirpated or entirely removed, They seem in several parts to
have amicably incorporated.
The scruples in the principles of these good people, as above described by Mr. Davies,
may flatter his national vanity, and they do honour to the goodness of his heart. But
the naked probability is, that where the swarms found few or no inhabitants, they settled
peaceably. In those cases in which the countries were
fully or numerously settled, war
would take place: different tribes or swarms of the great hive might arrive by different
routes, and at different periods of time-hundreds of years after one another. If a.
country were settled by stragglers from a neighbouring continent coming from time to
time, they would probably unite together peaceably. The contests constantly taking place
between the literati of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, respecting their relative seniorities
are only worthy of up-grown babies. Which came _/frst is not of the slightest im-
portance, and can never be satisfactorily known ; and it is as little likely that the country

100 A PASSAGE FROM A POEM OF TALIESSIN'3»*CI-IAP. III. SECT. XL
they last embarked from can ever be ascertained-whether it was Gaul, Belgium, or the
shores of the Baltic.
The expression used above, of up-grown babies may be thought strong; but really a
t enormous uantity of labour has been expended to as little purpose as can possibly
mos q
be imagined. Of what use can it be to ascertain how the different tribes came fiom the
East? Whether the first corners were Celtae or Scythians is really of the least possible
consequence. If the fact can be made out that a great hive existed somewhere in Upper
Asia, which did from time to time send out its swarms, and that these swarms did
people this country, it is all we can safely depend upon. The correct collocation of
the small divisions of these shepherd tribes it is in vain to attempt. Every fresh an.
tiquarian can shew reasons enough for some one tribe to have been the first settlers in
preference to others. Mr. Pinkerton is for the Goths, Scuths, Scyths, or
Scythians;
Mr. Chalmers for the Celtae or Cimbri. It is a mere play upon words: they were all
the same, using the same language, only varied with the natural small diH`erences which
would inevitably arise in great length of time, and under their migratory and ever-varying
habits of life and circumstances. In most of the questions respecting the dates and
localities of the respective subordinate tribes, whichever side an
ingenious man may take,
he will succeed in proving his hypothesis as far as probability extends; and really in
these researches nothing more than probability can be looked for. And if any person
should maintain that it was not the author's Celts but his own
Scythians or Goths who
first came, it will scarcely be considered worth a reply. Call them Goths, then; it
matters not. They were the persons, Goths or Celtas, who first came from the East of
the Caspian Sea, bringing with them their seventeen letters, their festivals, and their gods.
Dr. Aikin undertook to prove, that the country between the Thames and the Ouse was
the Thule of the ancients ; somebody else, that the Lothians were peopled by the
Saxons; another, that the Orcades were peopled by the Picts, or sea kings: all pretty
trifling, of no importance, but of no harm; and surely not deserving of the angry feelings
which it has excited. Another equally unimportant question has been violently agitated ;
namely, which first conquered the other. The Scotch say they conquered Ireland: the
Irish sa they conquered Scotland ; the Welsh, that they conquered both! It is a
spe-
Y
cies of Welsh main, to decide which no attempt will here be made: and then the author
hopes he will o&`end none in this most important concern.

the early accounts of the settlers of Britain says,

poem of Taliessin's, which is
called the appeasing of Lludd, the following very singular passage occurs:

its power of notation, and is in these respects exactly similar to our c, formerly pro-
nounced k.
It is observed by Mr. Roberts, that "
there is a Gabis, the capital of Gabaza, a
pro-
vince of Usbek Tartary ;" of which he says, that "it is too fitr to the East of the route of
the Cimmerians to admit of the supposition of its being the place intended by the poet,
further than as
intimating some
place bordering on the Caspian Sea." This is curious.
He then goes on to observe, that "in a work called the Triads, it is stated that Hu1' the
mighty, who first settled Britain, came from the summer
country, which is called DeHl
robani, that is, where Constantinople is at present." The idle stories about King
Brutus are of no other value than to confirm the fact, that there were ancient traditions
that the first settlers came from the East.

being repeatedly defeated, though in general only opposed by the petty princes in detail,
no general, organized, simultaneous defence ever being made, we must conclude that it
was very considerable, very much greater than it was some centuries afterward, when
again invaded by foreign enemies; for there is but too much reason to believe, that
what the excellent Tacitus put into the mouth of his British hero, was
generally too
true: Wai-:N :run Romans nav:-: Mann a nnsnntr, THEY cam. IT Panoz.
Notwithstanding all the fine actions and traits of heroic character attributed to their
ancestors, by the refined writers of imperial Rome, an
impartial critical examination, by
stripping their history of its false colouring, and exposing its inconsistencies, probably
would prove them to have been, until improved by the nations which they overran, no
better than a race of uncivilized barbarians. Mr. Lumsden has shewn, in his treatise on
the Antiquities ofRome, that many of the line actions attributed by Roman historians to
their ancestors, are mere copies from the early history of Greece.
Thus we find the combat of the Horatii and Curiatii related under diH`erent names, but
with the same circumstances by Democrates, apud Stobmuml* The action of Marius
Scaecola is given to Agesilaus, brother to Themistocles, by Agatharchidas, of Samos:-|-
and Curtius precipitating himself into the gulf; is ascribed, by Callisthenes, to a son of
King Midas;
Florus, I think it is, who, speaking of the city Veii, says,
"
The city of Veii, if ever
there was such a place." A learned author says,
"
The Romans pretend to have taken
in ten years a mighty town called Veii by them, and Boioi by Diodorus ; decem ceshdes
Iziemesgue continues circumsessam. Their leader, Fatalis dun: ad ercidium illius urbrlr,
was Furius Camillus. His name is a Tuscan title of Mercury, the messenger god, used
in Samothrace, Cadmillus or Casmillus, and in ancient India Cadmala."
Three places near Rome claim the honour of being Veii, and I believe they all support
their claims by indubitable genuine inscriptions. This reminds me of three real original
heads ofJohn the Baptist, which are
possessed by different churches. Inh-od. p.lxxx. note.
BRITAIN KNOWN TO ABISTOTLE.-CHLP. III. SECT. XIII.
It has been a common opinion that the British isles were not known to the ancient
Greeks, but this is a
great mistake. Perhaps it might not be much known to the phi-
losophers, but only to seafaring persons, and to such as were interested in commerce.
Aristotle§ attributes the discovery of it to the Phcenicians, who probably endeavoured as
much as
possible to conceal the route to it, on account of the great profits which they
derived from its trade. It was called Britain then, as now; and under this name were
included the adjacent isles. Ireland was also known to them, and distinguished from
England by the name of Erin or Ierne.

BRITAIN FIRST DISCOVERED BY PYTHEAS OF MARSEILLES.*CH. XII. SECT. XIV.
A certain man called Pytheas, who lived before Aristotle, was
despatched by the
colony which the Greeks had established at Marseilles, in quest of new countries-a
voyage of discovery. He appears really to have penetrated far to the north, because he
describes things totally new at that time to him and his countrymen, for which he was
only turned into ridicule by the later Greeks for his absurd lies, as
they thought ;° but
experience teaches us, t.hat what he said was in substance true. He described the British
isles; and, after leaving them and sailing to the North, he arrived at an island which he
called Thule: thence he continued his course till he met with a sea of solid ice, on ac-
count of which he could advance no farther. All this, which his enlightened country-
men in later ages considered so absurd and ridiculous, we know was perfectly feasible.
Although the ancient writers seem to have been very well acquainted with the fact that
there was a cluster of isles about the situation of Briton, yet their ideas upon the subject
were
very vague and unsettled. The Phaanicians must have known of them very early,
as Homer mentions tin, which could have come from no where but Britain.
PI-ICENICIAN TRADE T0 BRITAIN.-'CRAP' III. SECT. XV.
The Phcenicians at a
very early period had knowledge enough of navigation to enable
them to pass the Straits of Gibraltar, and either they or their offspring, the Tyrians, seem
certainly to have made a settlement, and built a
temple there. Nothing in ancient his-
tory is better established than this: and for some reasons, which I shall give elsewhere,
this must have taken place at a
very early period: I should think certainly before
the date of the Trojan war. Mr. Toland says there are
many passages in the works of
Eudoxus, Hecatzeus, Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, Polybius, Posidonius, not to speak of
Dicearchus and others, which prove that, not long alter the British isles were discovered
by the Phaenicians, the Greeks knew a
great deal of truth respecting them.'|' Herodotus
afirms that his countrymen had their tin from these islands; but he certainly seems to
have known little about them. He says, "Neither am I better acquainted with the
islands called the Cassiterides, from whence me are said to have our
tin."¢ The Phe-
nicians, we are told, were
very jealous of the interference of the Greeks in their trade to
the British isles. This could evidently have any effect only during the barbarous or
early times of Greece.

The Abbé de Fontenu,* Mr. Vallenoey says, has proved, that the Phmnicians had an
established trade with Britain before the Trojan war, 1190 years before Christ, and that
this commerce continued for many ages.
THE OLD GBEEKS KNEW MORE OF BRITAIN THAN THEIR SUCCESSORS.
CHAP. III. SECT. XVI.
It is said by Orpheus that Chronos was enchanted in an island West of Britain,
called Ogygia. In this he is followed by Pliny, Plutarch, Solinus, &c. Orpheus calls
the North Sea, Mare Cronium, idem quod mare Saturninum, et oceanus septentrionalis.
Herodotus says, that Pytheas called this sea
by the same name, Cronium. Col. Vallencey
justly observes,
"
It is evident that the Greeks knew more of the globe in the time of
Homer than of Herodotus, who was posterior to Homer by at least 4-00 years.
'
I
cannot help laughing] says Herodotus,
'
at those who pretend that the ocean flows
round our continent: no proof can be given of it....... I believe that Homer had
taken what he delivers about the ocean from some work of antiquity; but it was without
comprehending any thing of the matter, repeating what he had read without well under-
standing what he had read.'1' Mons. Gouget has made the same observation: '
The
i orance of the Greeks in geograpayf says he,
'
was extreme in all respects durmg
3"
many ages. They do not even appear to have known the discoveries made in more
ancient voyages, which were not absolutely unknown to Homer. I think I have shewn
that some very sensible traces of them existed in his poems.' "¢ Vallencey pertinently
adds,
"
How different must have been the marine of the Greeks drawn over-land in the
Peloponnesian war, from one sea to anotber,§ from that ofthe Carthaginians and Tyrians,
who in the time of Ezekiel" supplied Tyre with lead and tin t`rom,Britain !"1]'
Thus, as the later Greeks ridiculed the Pythagoreans, their ancestbrs, for their ignorant
credulity relative to the climate and other circumstances of the I-Iyperboreans and of
Thule, we find them also ridiculing them for their doctrine, that comets were
planets,
which moved in hyperbolic curves, and approached as near to the sun as
Mercury.

GEOGRAPHICAL IGNORANCE OF STRABO AND THE GREEK5 05' 1-|15 '|'1Mg_
CHAP. III. SEC'1'.XVII.
Strabo says in his second book, "
The utmost place of navigation in our time, from
Gaul towards the north, is said to be Ireland, which being situated beyond Britain, is,
by reason of the cold, with difiiculty inhabited; so that all beyond is reckoned un-
inhabitable."
Mr. Toland has justly maintained, that the way to Britain was known to the Phoeni-
cians and early Greeks, and that, after the destruction or decline of' Sidon, it was lost
tbr many generations. This seems
scarcely reconcileable with the fact of the Greeks
themselves having ever traded thither; because the utility of tin must have made it
constantly in greater demand as
they increased in civilization and numbers. The
manner, however, in which Strabo and others turn into ridicule the true accounts of
Pytheas, and the early writers who stated the truth, certainly prove that they were much
more
ignorant upon this point than their ancestors. Herodotus evidently knew little oi'
the British islands, as his expression it is said shews. Nowl should rather be led to
conclude that the Greeks in those early times did not go for the tin themselves, but were
indebted for it to the traders of Phoenicia or Sidon; and that after the ruin of Sidon, the
art of navigation was in a
great measure lost for some centuries. It is very certain from
Homer and Herodotus that tin was
procured, and it is almost equally certain that it was
not obtained by land through Gaul; for Britain was to the Greeks a
complete terra
incognita. It was to them what Upper Asia or Thibet is now to our residents at Cal-
cutta. They might know that the country lay opposite to Gaul; but it was not pos.
sible for them to penetrate through Illyricum and Gaul to Britain with any thing ofthe
nature of caravans, which they must have used to
carry on a trade. It is very certain
that the Phuenicians did originally sail to Britain. We may take this for an established
tact. Now Diodorus Siculus describes the carrying of tin from the Cassiterides, and
from Britain, by the Romans, to the northern coast of France, and thence on horses to
Marseilles, thirty days' journey. If they had been able to have gone by sea, they would
certainly never have done this; and it may perhaps be asked, what prevented them?
Strabo says, that a Phmnician captain finding himself followed by a Roman vessel,
purposely steered into the shallows, and thus destroyed both his own ship and the other.
Now this must have been in the latter times of Greece. I think all these circumstances
combined seem to shew, that the trade was in a
great measure
given up after the de.
struction of the empire of Sidon, but, that some of its merchants, always in a small way,
did, probably by coasting along shore, get to Britain. This must have been only an
inconsidemble trade, or the Romans would not have permitted the Sidonians, after the
destruction of Carthage, to have kept it to themselves. I think it appears, upon thg
whole, as Mr. Toland says, that the communication between Britain and the Eastern
0
106 IRELAND KNOWN 'ro 'run EARLY Gnnsxs.-ci-nr. III. sscr. xvrrr.
countries ceased for several centuries. Probably in lieu of the British tin, the difbculty
of procuring it compelled the builders to use copper and lead, which, from various cir-
cumstances, too evident to require pointing out, might become more
plentiful as the
state of society improved in Greece.
IRELAND KNOWN T0 THE EARLY GREEKS.-CRAP. III. SECT. XVIII.
The early Greeks were well acquainted with the fact that Britain consisted of a
cluster of islands, and it is probable they distinguished them by distinct names; that
they knew the Scilly isles by the name of Cassiterides, and reckoned them at ten in
number, which was substantially true. Ireland was very early known by the name ot'
.* The author of the Argonautica,-1' who is supposed to
have lived about the time of the tyrant Pisistratus, calls it Iernis, and Aristotle; calls it
Ierne. Mr. Toland justly observes, that Archbishop Usher did not gasconade when he
said, that the Roman people could not any where be found so
anciently named as Iernis
was. Diogenes Periegites§ says, in his description of the world, that the Irish were
Britons: Stephanus Byzantius calls it British Jucernia, the least of the two islands.
Diodorus Siculus mentions the Britons inhabiting the island called Iri.s,|| a name better
expressing Ere, (vulgarly Erinn,) the right name of Ireland, than Ierne, Juvemia, Hiber-
nia, or
any name that has been either poetically or otherwise used. And Strabo styles
Ireland British Iema. Pliny says in express words that every one of the British islands
was called Britain, whereas Albion was the distinguishing name of the Britain now
peculiarly so called, and so famous in the Greek and Roman writings. Britannia clara
Grzecis nostrisque scriptoribus-Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britannia: vocarentur
omnes. (Insulae nempe Britannicaa.)1[
Camden adds, that "
Britain is described by Orpheus. in the poems which were
really written by Onomacritus, who lived in the time of the Pisistratidae, according to
Clemens Alexandrinus and Tatian, all which proves that Britain was known near 200
years before Aristotle, and the ancient geographers Dicearchus and Eratosthenes, and
still more ancient Pytheas."*'

Britain. All this proves Britain known to the early Greeks. Dio* proves it forgotten:
he says,
"
The early Greeks and Romans did not so much as know that there was sueh
a place as Britain. Later ages doubted whether it was a continent or an island; and
much was written on both sides by those who knew nothing certain about the matter,
having neither seen it nor been informed about it by the natives, but only resting on
conjectures, the offspring of their leisure or invention."
Orpheus, or rather Onomacritus, mentions Ireland; but, says Bochart, "
he learned
the name and site of it from the Phoenicians: the Greeks at that time had not sailed
into these parts." Onomacritus lived 560 years before Christ. Polybius, who lived
only 124- years before Christ, acknowledges they knew nothing of the northern nations.
"
Itaque multa potuisse illis esse
perspecta de occidentalis oceani insulis quae Polybius
ignoraverit," says Bochart, speaking of the trade of the Phcenicians to these islands.~|°
ROAD T0 BRITAIN LOST, LIKE THAT TO AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA.-CHAP. III.
SECT. XIX.
That a
knowledge of the road to Britain should be lost, does not appear more won-
derful than the loss of the road to the Americas. And yet no unprejudiced person
can doubt, when he has considered all the circumstances of similarity which have been
pointed out between many religious rites, names, and local customs, of the natives of
Metico and the Asiatics, that the former were
originally peopled from the latter, by means
of ships; and not by passing by an almost impassable passsage over the frozen regions
near the North Pole.§
SURPRISING IGNOBANCE OF THE GREEKS.-CHAP.III. SECT. XX.
Few persons have tumed their attention to the extraordinary ignorance of the early
Greeks as to the origin of their own
religion or
mythological system; an
ignorance
rising almost to a ridiculous excess. This is most clearly proved by the various
treatises of their authors upon these subjects-such as Phornutus, Lucian, and many
others. Phornutus, speaking of Hercules, "owns the great variety, and consequently the

perplexedness and obscurity that occurs in his history, whereby it is diiiicult to know
certainly what were his real achievements, or what were fabulously fathered upon him."*
Indeed, speculations into the nature of these mysterious personages seem to have been
as much indulged in and followed by the ancients, as they have ever been by the
moderns; but these speculations prove their absolute ignorance. When they began to be
literary and enlightened-to cultivate science and learning-they found their country in
possession of numbers of gods and goddesses, who had grown up imperceptibly-of a
religion ofthe origin ofwhich they were perfectly ignorant-and ofa priesthood whose sys-
tem was rude and unformed, but gradually and daily increasing in power and ripening into
order. Its priests they found, like most others pretending to mysteries and secrets,
cheating the populace with juggling tricks, miracles, oracles, 8tc.: gross, exactly in
proportion to the stupidity and ignorance of their vulgar and frightened sernibarbarian
devotees. The whole was the child of circumstance or accident. The little form and
method which it ultimately assumed was an after ingraftation. When the ignorant
devotees began to inquire into the existence of their gods, they were amused by their
priests with histories of their births and adventures; and hence arose the vast variety of
mythological histories of numerous Apollos, Mercuries, &c. The same thing took
place amongst them which happened afterward in the Romish church. Every town,
every village, was ambitious of having a
god for its founder, as in Catholic countries in
later times every village has been ambitious of some patron saint. In both cases, as it
served the purpose of the priest, he did not long leave them in want. If he found any
slight tradition or rumour, he embellished it and made out a history. If he had no tradi-
tion to begin with, he soon invented one. These traditions were taken up by the poets
as machinery for their poems, and soon obtained credit. In this way the allegories and
astronomical lictions of the more oriental nations were gradually seized and clothed with
bodies, and believed by the credulous Greeks. Most nations are vain of themselves;
but the vainest of the vain were the Greeks. All their learning they received from
strangers-chiefly from eastern strangers-whom they denominated barbarians ; but
to whom they were too proud to acknowledge themselves obliged. From an absolute
ignorance of all language but their own, they blundered in every thing, of which some
very ridiculous proofs will hereaher be given. Every man who endeavoured to en-
lighten them, as was the case with Socrates, Pythagoras, &c., became suspected by the
priests, and consequently hated and persecuted by the devotees. This is what always
happens in all ages. Priests are always endeavouring to keep the people in ignorance.
They always travel about 6B:y years in the rear of mankind; but they always boast of
themselves as the mos! enlightened, and the rabble uniformly believe them. In the
treatises of Lucian, Cicero, &c., it is perfectly ridiculous to observe how these philo-
» rm.. Hua., p. as.
SURPRISING IGXORANCE OP THE GR.EEKS.*CHAP. III. SECT. XX. 109
sophers proceeded to explain the nature of their gods. They, enlightened as they were,
could find no way but to have recourse to an
explanation of the idle genealogies, pe-
digrees, &c., instead of going to the origin of their language, and to etymology. They
argued as if they supposed themselves the origin of every thing; that there had been no
nations before them. Thus we find them deriving every word from their own
language,
the Greek, when in most instances they ought to have applied to their ancestors or
pre-
decessors, the barbarians, as
they called them. The word Druid may serve as an
example of this kind. They derived it from the Greek word Apug, an Oak, when in
fact the Druids were in existence, and called by that name, long before either the Greeks
or their language existed. In the fue arts the Greeks were
giants, but in science they
were
pigmies. What would they have known of science, if their Platos and Pythago-
rases had not travelled into the East ? They were
elegant, refined, and highly polished;
and, in the fine arts, unrivalled. But in science and real learning, they were inferior to
the Orientals, and were the greatest liars upon earth. They wilfully mistated every
thing, or
they foolishly confounded every thing.
In almost every country Hercules is said to have been the founder of the state. I
suspect that this arose from a
figurative expression similar to what Virgil applies to the
Trojans. Eneas led them into Italy, .rub auspice Teucri. But it is not meant
literally
that Teucer was the leader. The same
meaning only was
originally intended to be
conveyed when the Phcenicians are said to have settled colonies here or there under the
command of the Sidonian or Tyrian Hercules. A colony settled and erected pillars at
the Straits of Gibraltar, under the tutelage of their patron god, who of course is said, by
their means, to have erected the Pillars of Hercules. In this way Hercules or some
other god is found to have been the leader of every expedition. After a time, as the
origin of states began to be forgotten, and superstition increased, the figurative meaning
began to be forgotten, and a literal one adopted, and medals were cast and statues erected.
It is seldom that these things are fabricated till long after the time of the persons in
honour of whom they are made. Thus the Scotch are now
erecting a statue to John
Knox, the reformer but persecutor, who caused the destruction of all their fine ca-
thedrals. The priests are only playing their old game over
again. Priests will say it
is not done by them. No; it is their devotees that do it. They are too wise to
waste their own
money, but they are the cause of it, and could stop it with a
single word.
It was a custom in some countries for the priests to assume the names of their gods.
This was another source of error. Thus from the union of several causes arose the
eoniirsion amongst the gods, and the multitude ofgods of the same name. Hercules 'had
almost as
many names as the Virgin at Loretto, under whose image the writer of this
work counted upwards of forty diferent epithets.

THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE.-CHAP. III. SECT. XXI.
Manly authors have been of opinion that the ancients were acquainted with the load-
stonc, and knew how to make it available to direct them in their journeys by sea and
land. The evidence seems to me to be decidedly in favour of this opinion. On this
subject the Rev. Mr. Maurice observes, "
The magnet is mentioned by the most ancient
elnssienl writers, under the name of Lapis Heraclius, in allusion to its asserted inventor,
Hercules; and Dr. Hyde enables me to aiiirm, that the Chaldeans and Arabians have
innnemorially made use of it to guide them over the vast deserts that overspread their
respective countries! According to the Chinese records also, the emperor Ching-
Vnng, above a thousand years before Christ, presented the ambassadors of the King of
Cochin-China with a
species of magnetic index, which, says Martinius, '
certé monstro-
haf iter, sive terrd illud, .rice mari, facientihusf The Chinese, he adds, call this
instrument CHINAM, a name by which they at this day denominate the rnariner's com-
pass."'|' Mr. Maurice proceeds to argue from the laws in the most ancient Hindoo
hooks respecting the rate of interest allowed on
money lent on adventures at sea, that
the compass must have been known to the Hindoos.$ He then contends, that the vase
given by Apollo to Hercules, in which he is said to have sailed over the ocean, ought to
be the vase
hy which or by means
ofrohich, &c., and that this vase contained the mariner's
compass. Certainly this makes sense of that which is otherwise nonsense. He then
observes, that the passage in Homer which describes the vessels of the Phmacians as
instinct with soul, and gliding through the pathless ocean without pilot, to the places of
their destination, evidently alludes to the compass: and adds,
"
Whatsoever truth there
may be in this statement, it is evident from the extensive intercourse anciently carried on
between nations inhabiting opposite parts of the globe, where the starspeculiar to their
omn native regions could no longer rfbrd them the means
of sajk navigation, that the im-
portant discovery must be of far more ancient date than the year of our Lord 1260, to
which it is generally assigned, and by the means of Marco Paulo, a man famous for his
travels into the East."§
On this Mr. Playfair observes, that "
The compass is said to have been known to the
Chinese 1115 years before Christ. Arg in Irish is a
ship, and ia! is to turn round; it
signifies also an index. Earc is the heavens, and Earc-iul describes the instrument
turning to a certain point of the heavens."
It is not unlikely that Marco Paulo might bring home what he thought a new dis-
covery; but the mariner's compass was certainly previously known in Europe. Alonzo
el Sabio has, in his famous code of laws promulgated in 1260, a
passage to the following
effect: "
Anda s mariners guide themselves in the dark night by the needle, which is

the medium (medianera) between the magnet and the star, in like manner
ought those
who have to counsel the king always to guide themselves by justice." Again ; Jacobus
Vitriacus, Bishop of Ptolemais, who died at Rome, in 124-4», says,
"
Valde neeessariug
est acus
navigantibus in mari," and Vincentio, of Beauvais, (Vicentius Bellovacius)
observes in his Speculum Doctrinale,
"
Cum enim vias suas ad portum dirigere nesciunt
cacumen aczis ad adamantem Iapidem fricatum, per transversum in festuca parva inii-
gunt, et vasi pleno aqua: immittunt." Bellovacius died in l266.*
Dr. Wallis'|' seems to have been exceedingly mistaken when he ascribed the mariner's
compass to the English. Herwart, in his Admiremda Ethicae Theologice, endeavours to
prove, that the old Egyptians had the use of it, and that the Bembin table contains the
doctrine of it enveloped in hieroglyphics. The learned Fuller, in his Miscellam°es,1
asserts, that the Phcenicians knew the use of it, which they endeavoured to conceal by
all possible means, as
they did their trading in general. Osorius, in his discourse of the
Acts gf King Emanuel, refers the use of the compass among the Europeans to Vasquez
de Gama and the Portuguese, who found it among some bnrbarous pirates about the
Cape of Good Hope, who probably were some remains of the old Phcenicians or Ara-
bians, or at least had preserved from them this practice. But Mons. Fauchet, in his
Antiquities qf France, quotes some verses from a Poet in that country, who wrote
A. D. 1180, wherein is a
plain description of the mariner's box as words can
convey.
"
What objections," says another learned writer,§
"
have been made against the
veracity of Scripture, upon the supposition that the Jews had not the knowledge of the
use of the loadstone or needle (for either will serve) in navigation; but that the know-
ledge, at least of that use of it, was invented long after! And that they could not sail to
the land of Ophir (the Dust coast) without it, every one knows. The others assert that
they coasted it, which those who have sailed in those seas
say, is impossible to be done
against the trade winds, tides, &c. The very acts they make incredible without such
knowledge, and the others are without difficulty, when it is shewn, by the Scripture, that
they had the knowledge; and the means necessary. What Lucretius,|| in plain words,
attributes to the gross air, the spirit, and shews how it presses the iron to this stone,
Plato attributes to the divine force in their God, the air.{|'
"
It is not art which makes
thee excel, but a divine power that moves thee, such as is in the stone which Euripides
named the magnet, and some call the Heraclian stone which attracts iron rings," &c.
Austin" speaks of the same. We know that magnet, or loadstone, is a wonderful
attractor of iron. This stone is six times mentioned in Scripture by the name D*J"JB
pninim. The condition, which makes Iron and other things follow it is expressed in

Job* by 'WD mslc, iaxuvov, attraction.~|' Its colour is described; by mym adme,
flesh-coloured, ruddy, as it is when dug, and more approaching black, as flesh: and
many of these stones are, when dried and in their parts contracted, of the colour of
reddish clay. Its usefhlness and worth is expressed' by mp1 ikre, by mmm tube, tj-c.
because no other stone of that size is of any real value, except a
spark of diamond to cut
glass.
"This will explain and clear a
passage of' Scripture which seems at present to be but
indiiferently translated, and which is referred to above. In the twenty-eighth chapter of
the book of Job, we are told, that the price of wisdom is above rubies. The literal trans-
lation of the original is, agreeably to the true sense
off the first and last words before given,
'
Attractio Sapientiae pm Magnetibus'-the attraction of wisdom is beyond magnets;
meaning, that the attraction of wisdom is to the well-disposed greater in effect, and of
more value, than the attraction of the loadstone, though it draw the heaviest bodies, and
by it all the advantages of' navigation and the wealth of commerce are obtained.
"
The golden or brass cup, which is said, by very many ancient authors to have been
given to Hercules by Apollo, or Nereus, or Oceanus, and with which he sailed over the
ocean, can mean nothing but the mariner's compass, to the knowledge of which he had
at least attained; though I should rather imagine him to be the inventor of' it, by the
name Lapis Heraclius given to the mag'net."§
In the Saturnalia of Macrobius,|| is an expression which Sir Hildebrand Jacob thinks
intimates that Hercules sailed over the ocean not IN a
mysterious vase, but BY MEANS of
a mysterious vase, which was the mariner's compass, swimming in water;
"
Ego autem
arbitror non poculo Herculem maria transvectum, sed navigio cui Scypho nomen iiiit."
"
It appears that what was called 1[ the image of JupiterHammon, (whose Libyan tem-
ple, according to Herodotus, took its rise from Phmnicia,) was
nothing more than a
compass box," which was carried about by the priests, when the oracle was consulted,
in a golden ship."
"
It is probable that the Famous golden fleece was nothing else: whence the ship of
Phrixus1'1' (who is Apher or Aphricus, and the same with Jupiter Ammon) which carried
it, is said to have been sensible and possessed of the gift of speech. So also the ship
Argos which fetched it from Colchis."
"
To these testimonies I shall subjoin that of the great Homer,1¢ who, speaking ofthe
Phaeacians and their extraordinary skill in maritime affairs, makes Alcinous give to the

the following lines, which have puzzled all commentators: and which either have no
meaning at all, or
plainly evince the use of the compass amongst that sea-faring people.

Sanchoniathon, the Phoenician, says, that Omanus contrived Baetulia stones that
moved as
having lii`e.1'
Mr. Vallencey, says,
"
Many authors have proved that the ancients had the use ofthe
compass: the properties of the magnet were known to them; and in honour of the dis-
coverer, it was called the Heraclean stone, and the place abounding with it was called
Heracles. Refert Stesichorus, Solem in eodem poculo per oceanum
navigasse, quo et
Hercules trajecerit." 1
The learned Bayer, in his line designs of the celestial constellations, represents thc
arrow of' Apollo as a magnetic needle; and he took his designs chiefly from a
very
ancient book of drawings.
From a careful consideration of the whole subject, I am of opinion that the mariner's
compass was known to the ancients, and that it was never lost entirely, either in Europe
or Asia, though unskillirlly used; and always continued to he known to the Chinese
and the eastern nations, whence it was
brought to Europe from China, perhaps in an ill-
contrived state, by Marco Paulo; and from the Indian seas, about the same time, by
Vasco de Gama. That this knowledge should have been possessed by the ancients, will
not surprise any one who has seen the learned work of Monsieur Dutens, sur les Décor:-
eertes des Anciens atlribués aux Modernes. It is rather remarkable that he has overlooked
this instance of the mariner's compass, which is certainly much more striking than many
which he has noticed. There are so many circumstances named respecting the voyages
ofthe ancients, which could not be undertaken without the compass, that when I cou-
sider them, and the evidence of the diB`erent authors which I have cited, I cannot
entertain a doubt that it was known to them; and this removes many great and serious
difficulties to the credibility of the historical accounts of the colonization of these western
countries.

TELESCOPES KNOWN T0 THE DRUIDS.°-CRAP. III. SECT. XXII.
Many persons have thought that the Druids and the ancients generally had the use of
telescopes.
According to Strabo,* a
large mirror was elevated on the summit ot' the temple of the
sun at Heliopolis, to reflect into that temple the fixll splendour of its meridian beam,
whilst another of still larger dimensions was
placed on the Pharos at Alexandria, in such
a manner as to reflect ships approaching Egypt at a great distance, and imperceptible to
the eye. Mr. Maurice has observed, that if these had been metallic reflectors, instead of
glass tinned, they must soon have been corroded. That does not seem to me to follow
as a necessary consequence. But we know the ancient Egyptians did possess the art of
making glass, as is proved by the glass netting of beads, which I saw spread on the breast
of a female mummy in the Museum of Lyons. It came from the royal catacombs at
Thebes. This female was probably of the Memnonian race, consequently very ancient
indeed, because she was a
Negress.
Diodorus Siculus says, that in an island west ofthe Celtm, the Druids brought the sun
and moon near them, whence some have suspected telescopes were known to themsl'
The ancients knew that the milky way consisted of small stars; this, it is thought, that
they could not have known without telescopes.;
The expression in one of the Triads, of the moon appearing to be near the earth, is
curious, and Mr. Davies suspects from this, that the Druids knew the use of the tele-
scope. These Triads every one must allow to have existed long prior to the discovery
of telescopes in modern times. In one of them it is written: Dryc/l ab, Cibddar or
Cilidawr, the speculum of the Son ofperaadingglance, or of the searcher of mystery, as
one of the secrets of the island of Britain.§
The Triads insist on the knowledge which the Druids possessed of astronomy. And
although the Greeks give the Metonic cycle to one of their countrymen, Hesiod names
the great year as known in the regions of Pluto long before Meton's time.|| There is
very good reason to believe, that the regions pf Pluto were the countries where they
feigned the Cimmerian darkness to be: probably Gaul or Britain was the empire of Dis.
On this subject much very curious information may be found in the sixth chapter of
the second volume of the Origines of Sir William Drummond. But I think all his
reasoning goes to prove, that although the telescope was known to the most ancient as-
tronomers, who may be supposed to have invented the Neros, yet, that like the principles
of the ancient formulae of India, it was lost and unknown in the time of Hipparchus.
Sir William supposes, that the ravages and destruction caused by the Iconoclasts of

Persia, had caused the loss of the science in Chaldea and Egypt. I ggnfggg this is not
satisfactory to me. I think he must go back to an earlier period. He points gm; the
curious circumstance that the Persians had traditions of several astronomical facts, one
of which was, that the Galaxy consisted of stars, which could not have been known
without glass lenses. But he acknowledges that this was merely a tradition; and this
certainly is all in favour of Baillie's doctrine. There is one supposition which, as it
appears to me, may be reasonably entertained, and may, perhaps, go a
long way towards
removing much of the diliiculty, which is, to suppose that the telescope was known to
a very few of the priests, and kept by them in private for the use
only of the persons
initiated into the higher mysteries.
GUNPOWDER.-CHAP. III. SECT. XXIII.
The following observations are very curious, to say the least of them. If gunpowder
were not used, recourse must have been had to what is commonly called thundering
powder, or pulvis fulminans.

not suppose that those great searchers into nature, the Druids, might also light upon
the secret P
. . . _ . _ We may observe in Lucan's satirical description of the Druidical
grove near Marseilles, a
plain evidence of this invention. "
There is a
report," says he,
"
that the grove is often shaken and strangely moved, and that dreadful sounds are heard
from its caverns; and that it is sometimes in ablaze without being consumed." In
the poem of' Dargo, t/ze son
aft/ze Druid ofBel, phenomena of' a somewhat similar nature
are mentioned. No ordinary meteor would have been so much noticed by the poet, nor
so much dreaded by the people. The Gallic word for lightning, is De'lan or De'/anach,
literally the flash or flame of God; and Dmi'!an or Druz"!anac/l, the flame or flash of
the Druids. And in a well-known fragment of Ossian, in which he speaks of some arms
tabricated by Luno, the Scandinavian Vulcan, the sword of Oscar is distinguished by this
epithet, and compared to the flame of the Druids; which shews that there was such a
flame, and that it was
abundantly terrible.'l"'
Dr. Smith says very truly,
"
Every thing within the circle of Drui'each¢!, or
magic,
or to speak more properly, within the compass of natural experimental philosophy, was
thc study of' the Druids ; and the honour of every wonder that lay within that verge was
always allowed them."1
Mr. Maurice§ states, that in his opinion the Hindoos had the knowledge of gunpowder
even from the most remote antiquity. In this he is supported by Mr. Crawford."
'
In order to produce fire from heaven, they might grind cobalt and oil together, though`this was a
thing which
would not always answer.
The Celtic name for miracle, is Miar-Bhcil, or Meur-Bhe' il, the finger of Bel, whence comes the French merveille
and the English marvel.

A PHCENICIAN Com BROUGHT FROM CITIUM, BY DR. CLARK.
CHAPTER IV.
THE HYPERBOREANS WERE BRITONS.*SEC'1'. I.
IN the ancient Grecian authors frequent mention is made of a nation of people called
Hyperboreans. The word is evidently figurative, meaning literally, people beyond the
North wind. Diodorus Siculus says, the Hyperborean island was
governed by a
family
called Boreades. In Irish Boreadhach means a valiant chief or noble; and Mr. Val-
lence says, that the magistrates in Ireland were often called Boreadhas; but I should
Y
think that the word Boreas is probably derived from Bar, strong, and eas, ablast of wind,
and Hyperboreans, a
people beyond the North wind, is a
figurative expression, meaning
the most extreme North. A great question has been raised as to the place of residence
of these people. It has been contended by Mr. Huddleston, Mr. Toland, Mr. Davies,
&c., that though there were two nations of them, that mostly when they are spoken of
by the Greek writers, a race of people is meant
residing in all or some of' the British
islands, and Ireland or Thule. The other Hyperboreans were
supposed to lie due
north of the Greeks beyond Sarmatia. They are both sufiiciently north to justify the
figurative expression of Hyper-Borean. According to Herodotus, Aristeas, who wrote
118 THE HYPERBOREANS WERE BRI'1'0NS.*'CHAP. IV. SECT. I.
before Homer, reports that the Hyperboreans dwelt upon the sea, beyond the Arimaspi,
and their neighbours the Essedonesd' Hercules went from Greece to the I-Iyperboreans
through Illyricum, and by the Eridanus or Po.1' This points directly to Britain. They
are said to have sent gifts to Delos, which Grst arrived on the Adriatic, whence they
were forwarded to Dodona, then to Delos. They came then, Mr. Davies says, from the
land of the Celtae, whom Heraclides, of Pontus, calls Hyperhoreans.:',_'
These descriptions are
only applicable to the British isles. Neither in the island of
Britain, nor in the contiguous parts of Europe, can any religious order of ancient
celebrity be found except the Druids, whose theology had a
great similarity to that of
the Greeks and Romans.§ Hence it seems probable, that the Hyperboreans, who
brought their gifts to Apollo in the vale of Tempe, down to the last ages of Paganism,||
were Druids of Britain. Cicero1]' says,
"
Tertius (Apollo) Jove et Latona natus, quem
ex Hyberboreis Delphos ferunt advenisse-Reliqui (Apollines) omnes silentur, omnes-
que res aliorum gestaa at unum Jovis et Latona: iilium referuntur."-The legitimate
Apollo of Grecian worship is therefore an accredited Hyperborean. The following is
the account from Diodorus Siculus, which he took from Heeataeus and other ancient
historians:
"
Opposite to the coast of Gallia Celtica there is an island in the ocean, not smaller
than Sicily-lying to the North, which is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are so
named because they dwell beyond the north wind. This island is of a happy tem-
perature, rich in soil, and fruittiil in every thing, yielding its produce twice in the year.
Tradition says that Latona was born there, and for that reason they venerate Apollo
more than any other god. They are in a manner his priests, for they daily celebrate
him with continual songs of praise, and pay him abundant honours.
"In this island there is a magnificent grove fspsvag (or precinct) of Apollo, and a
remarkable temple of a round form, adorned with many consecrated gifts. There is also
a
city sacred to the same god, most of the inhabitants of which are
harpers, who con-
tinually play upon their harps in the temple, and sing hymns to the god, extolling his
actions.
"The Hyperboreans use a particular dialect, and have a remarkable attachment" to
the Greeks, especially to the Athenians and the Delians, deducing their friendship from
remote periods. It is related that some Greeks formerly visited the Hyperboreans, with
whom they left consecrated gifts of great value; and also that in ancient times, Abaris
coming from the Hyperboreans into Greece, renewed their friendship and familyfl' in-
tercourse with the Delians,
"
It is also said, that in this island, the moon appears very near to the earth; that

certain eminences, ofa terrestrial form, are
plainly seen in it, that the god (Apollo) visits
the island once in a course
of nineteen years, in which period the stars complete their re-
volutions; and that for this reason the Greeks distinguish the cycle of nineteen years, by
the name of the great year. During the season of his appearance the god plays upon
the harp, and dances every night, from the vernal equinox, till the rising of the pleiades,
pleased with his own successes.
"
The supreme authority in that city and sacred precinct is vested in those who are
called Boreadae, being the descendants of Boreas; and their governments have been
uninterruptedly transmitted in this line."
Diodorus' expressly says, when speaking of Britain, that it "
Ipsi Ursae subjectam."-1'
The evidence of Diodorus is complete that, by the Hyperboreans who were so
intimately
connected with Delphi, the natives ofBritain were meant.
It is very curious that the situation of Dodona was unknown to many of the Greek
writers. Some say it was in Thessaly, some in Epirus, some in Thespratia, Chaonia,
and Molossia, and others say it was so called from Dodonium, the son of Javan. Mr.
Vallencey has made a
great many very curious observations on the similarity of the
Dadanan of Ireland and the Dodona of Greece.;
TWO NATIONS OF HYPERBOBEANS.--CHAP. IV. SECT. II.
Amongst their nonsensical fables, the Greeks had one which stated that Apollo fled
from them to the Hyperboreans.
Potter says,§ When the God forsook Delphi, he betook himself to the Hyperboreans,
as we learn from Claudian:
--l-
pulcher Apollo
Luau-at Hyperboms Delphi: cmsantibua ans.
And in former times he was
thought to be a lover of that nation, and to remove thither
out of Greece. Abaris, one of that country, and priest of Apollo, who travelled into
Greece about the time of Pythagoras, is said to have written a book concerning Apollo's
oracles|| and removal to the Hyperboreans. And the Athenians, at a time when the
plague raged over all Greece, received an oracle from thence, commanding them to make
vows and prayers in behalf of the rest: and they continued to send gifts and offerings
thither, as
they had formerly done to Delphi.
When Pausanias wrote, the ideas of the Greeks were
very conliised respecting the

l20 THE ANCIENT ORACLES FOUNDED BY CEI.TE.*'CHAP. IV. SECT. III.
Hyperboreans; and Mr. Toland has well observed that care must be taken not to con-
fbund the continental with the insular Hyperboreans. I am quite satisfied that by the
Hyperboreans, when the Greeks had any tolerably clear ideas, they generally meant the
British isles. Apollo was the sun; and when he fled and took away the oracle, as
they
said, from Delphi to the Hyperboreans, they meant to the extremest West, the utmost
point to which he could go. He never went to the north-east. This was an instance
of the cajolery of' the priests, when the oracle at Delphi began to be laughed out of
fashion by those wicked wretches, the Grecian philosophers. Of' the meaning of' the
word Boreas, whence the word Hyperborean comes, the Greeks were
perfectly ignorant,
as indeed they were of almost every thing relating to the origin of their nation or their
language. Though from this censure Plato must in some degree be excepted, for in his
Cratylus, he says,
"
that the Greeks had borrowed many words from the barbarians, es-
pecially such of the Greeks as lived in barbarian countries," which Mr. Toland observes
may fairly be supposed to include those who navigated, or drove any trafic with them."
Hence the divine philosopher himself draws this accurate inference, "
That ifany man
would endeavour to adjust the etymologies of' those words with the Greek language, and
not rather seek for them in that to which they originally belong, he must needs be at a
|oss.""
THE ANCIENT ORACLES FOUNDED BY CELTEZ.-CHAP. IV. SECT. III.
Carte, in his History of England, observes, that the conformity of religious worship
between the people of' Delos and those of the Hyperborei, produced a
very early corre-
spondence between them; for they are mentioned by Herodotus, says he, as
utterly un-
known to the Scythians, (who had no intercourse with the British isles,) but much
spoken of' at Delos, whither they used to send, from time to time, sacred presents of
their first-fruits, wrapped in bundles of wheat-straw, such as were made use of by the
'I`hracians in their sacred rites and sacrifices to Diana; and, adds Carte, "
There is not
a fact in all antiquity that made a greater noise in the world, was more universally known,
or better attested by the gravest and most ancient authors among the Greeks, than this
of the sacred embassies of the Hyperboreans to Delos, in timespreceding, by an interval
q/'some ages, the voyages of the Carthaginians to the north of' the Straits of Gibraltar, to
which possibly the reports about that people might give occasion." Respecting the
embassy to convey the first-fruits named above, Herodotus says,

That the suite of this
Hyperborean embassy having been ill-treated by the Greeks, they took afterward another

them to the nation that lay nearest to them on the continent of Europe, with a request
that they might be forwarded to their next neighbours: and thus (says Herodotus) they
were transmitted from one people to another, through the Wzsrnnx regions, till they
came to the Annrsrr c, and there being put into the hands of the Dodonmns, the first
of the Greeks that received them, they were
conveyed thence by the Melian Bay, Euboea,
Carystus, Andras, and Tenos, till at last they arrived at Delos."" The route by the
Western regions and the Adriatic, fixes them clearly to the British isles.'|'
It is a curious circumstance, that prophets are said to have come from the Hyperbo-
reans and settled the oracle of Delphi. This is the account of -Pausanias, And, in a
fragment of a
poem composed by a woman called Beo, three Hyperboreans, called
Pagasis, Agyeus, and Olen, are named. In the old Irish books, these are the names
given to three ranks of Irish Druids, Bag-ois, Agh-ois, and Ollam. The last is said to
have been an
expounder ofthe law of nature.j;
Pausanias makes Beo say, that Olen with the Hyperboreans founded the Delphic
oracle, and was the first who returned answers in heroic verse. The passage is thus
translated by Mr. Hutchin:
No Grecian yet warmed with Ere
Could fit th' unpolish'd language to the lyre,
Till the Ent priest ofPhaabus, Ulm, mee,
`
And changed for smoother verse their stunning prose.§
In the histories of Ireland, we
perpetually meet with circumstances of this kind, which
I cannot believe are the accommodations of Irish fables, by the bards, to the Grecian
histories. Nobody can doubt that these Hyperboreans of Pausanias, named, in the
poem, were Druids of the same names as those mentioned in the Irish history. These
cannot possibly be forgeries of the bards. Circumstances of this kind prove beyond
dispute, that the Irish histories are not all forgeries, but that, however they may have
been embellished by the bards, there is certainly truth in the bottom of some of them.
One fact of this kind is worth a hundred bardic histories-is worth the whole of Mr.
O'Connor's two volumes of the Chronicles qfEri.
Mr. Bryant says, the Hyperboreans sent presents and an-npvqpafa, memorials, to Delos.

122 THE ANCIENT OBACLES FOUNDED BY CBLTE.-CHAP. IV. SECT. III.
Hercules and Perseus are also said to have visited this people. The Hyperborean
priests who brought presents to Delos never returned, but remained to odiciate at the
temple?
The annotators on the sixth book of Cmsar's Commentaries observe,
"
Gallorun
philosophos etiam philosophis Grecis priores existirnant nonnulli Grzeci scriptores, ut
Aristoteles apud Diog. Laertium, qui non a Grtecis ad Gallos philosophiam devenisse,
sed a Gallia ad Gracos prodiisse scriptum reliquit."1'
The opinion of Aristotle, that philosophy came to the Greeks from the Gauls, and no;
from the Greeks to the Gauls, is very striking, and must be received as evidence of the
first importance. It is of the nature of the evidence of an unwilling witness.;
Dionysius of Halicarnassus says, that "
Atlas was the first king of Arcadia, and that
he came from Mount Caucasus." And Pausanias says, that "
the Curetes came to
Ida in Crete from the land of the Hyperboreans, and that they built a temple at Olympia
in Peloponnesus, on a hill called Kpovmv or
Kpova7w¢¢;." Apollodorus states Atlas to be
the son of Japetus,§ who, with his issue, is stated to have Hrst settled the famous mys-
teries of the Cabiri in Boaotia. But they received them from Ceres. Here of course
ends history; but it does not end till it has carried us fairly back to the tenth chapter of
Genesis, to Japetus, the father of Gomer. I pay very little attention to these Greek and
Roman historians in general, about these very early times, at least to their regular,
finished histories; but when I find facts like this dropping from them, which are
confirmed by circumstances or other histories unknown to them, and the true nature of
which they do not understand, I pay much attention to them. I formerly said that the
tenth chapter of Genesis would be confirmed by profane historians. This is an exem-
pliiication of what I meant. This brings these mysteries of the Cabiri of Baeotia direct
from the Celtae,~the children of Gomer or the Gomerians. The Curetes also came from
the Hyperboreans. These Curetes were Druids, or Corybantes, or Courbs, or Culdees,
as will be proved in this work.
From all this, it is certain that the Greeks, the conceited, vain, elegant Greeks, were
indebted for much of their philosophy as well as many of their fables to the ancient
Celta:-fables perhaps formed from histories, or misunderstood allegories of the Celtte
and other barbarians, their predecessors or neighbours."
It is curious to observe, that as soon as authentic history could go no higher, Apollodo-
rus calls in Ceres to make a finish. Whenever these gods or goddesses are met with in
this manner, the language may be simply paraphrased, "I know nothing more about it."

ABARIS.-CRAP. IV. SECT. IV. 128
I beg it may be observed that my Gomerian, Cimmerian Celtaa in their journey from
the Caspian sea, will at different times have exactly answered to every place from which
the Greek histories say the Hyperboreans did come.
They must have been in every one
of the countries where they are placed by the Greeks; so that when they say the Hyper-
boreans came from the extreme north, they say what, relatively to their own situation, must
have been at one time perfectly true. They must have come from Sarmatia. If the
reader will pay a
very little attention to the map, he will see at once why the succeeding
tribes called Scythian, are so much confounded with those of earlier times-the Celtm.
They were nothing but successions of tribes from the same countries, at long intervals of
time.
Mr. Davies has observed, that the nature of Druidical traditions demonstrates, that the
Druids were Celtze, and that their progenitors had been present with this nationfrom its
common source. Thus, for instance, we are told by Casar, "
Galli se omnes ab Dite
patre prognatos prmdicant. idque a Druidibus proditum dicunt"-The Gauls aiiirm that
Pluto or Dis was their common
progenitor, and refer this account of themselves to the
tradition of the Druids? But it is not necessary to press this iiirther, as I suppose it
will not be denied. It was on account of this descent that the Druids taught their peo~
ple that they reckoned their time by nights instead of days.
"
Ob earn causam, spatia
omnis temporis, non nurnero dierum sed noctium, finiunt: dies natales, et mensium et
annorum initia, sic observant, ut Nocrnu dies subsequatur." This was the custom of
the author of the first Book of Genesis: And the evening and the morning were the _/Frat
day. Again-From even to even shall you keep your sabbath.
Mr. Davies says in reply to the question,
"
What is the peculiar connexion between
the night and the portion of Dis? I answer, That as the whole of Europe lay west of
Asia, it was overshadowed by the darkness of night; when the morning arose
upon the
Eastern inhabitants of the Noachidae, and the evening sun would appear to descend, in
its progress towards the western continent, as to a lower sphere. Hence the portion of
Japhet, or of Dis, obtained the description of a lower region, the land of shades and of
night."'|' I think the reason for the famous Cimmerian darkness may really be found
here. The idea of Mr. Davies is very ingenious.
ABARIS.*CHA.P. IV. SECT. IV.

very celebrated philosopher of the
Hyperhoreans. It seems to be pretty well established that he was from the British isles,

Under this story, there is evidently some allegory concealed, which I do not preten to
understand, or perhaps this arrow was the magnetic needle. I think we have very good
reason to believe that this learned Druid would hold the doctrines of Pythagoras, and this
may serve us in some measure as a clue to the doctrines of the Druids, as we are pretty
well acquainted with the doctrines of Pythagoras. It is remarkable that Suidas (in
Pythag.) does not say, that Abaris leamed from Pythagoras, but the contrary-that
Pythagoras learned from him, and this I am certain every one must allow to be the most

ABARIS PROBABLY A NATIVE OF IRELAND.-CHAP. IV. SECT. Y.
Col. Vallencey has observed, that there is an account in Ireland of a person called
Abhras; which perfectly agrees with the description of the Hyperhorean Abaris of Dio-
dorus and Himerius. This Irish Abhras is said to have gone to distant parts in quest of
knowledge, and after a long time to have returned by way of Scotland, where he remained
seven
years, bringing a new system ofreligion. This was opposed by the Fribolgs, in con-
sequence of which a civil war arose, which lasted twenty-seven years before the religion

was established. This Abhras certainly looks very like Abaris of the Greek story. Abaris
is called by Suidas a Scythian, but he is said to have come from the Hyperborean island
to the north ot` Gaul; this suiiiciently fixes him to the British isles. The description of
Abaris the sage, given by Himerius, is, "
that he was
by nation a
Hyperborean; became
ii Grecian in speech; and resembled a
Scythian in habit and appearance. Whenever he
moved his tongue, you would imagine him to be some one out of the midst of the academy
or very Lyceum." He was, Himerius says,
"
atiixble and pleasant in conversation; in des-
patching great adiairs, secret and industrious; quick-sighted in present exigencies; in pre-
venting liiture dangers, circumspect; a searcher after wisdom; desirous of friendship;
trusting, indeed, little to fortune ; having every thing trusted to him for his prudence."1'
He is reported by some to have been a
Scythian. A moment's consideration of what
I have said, a little time since, respecting the countries of the Celtm and Scythians, will
shew how this has arisen amongst a
people like the Greeks, who had certainly not the
most distant idea of the true circumstances relating to the histories either ofthe Celta, the
Scythians, or of themselves. I do not suppose he was of one of the earliest tribes of
Celtae by thousands of years. The migratory Celtae had become Scythians in the day
when he appeared. But Diodorus Siculus, in fixing him to the ISLA ND of the Hyper-
boreans, at once shews who he was-a Celtic Druid of Britain or Ireland.;
The circumstances respecting Abaris are such as to render it absurd in the highest
degree to suppose, that the country he came from had not the use of letters. And if we
are to doubt his existence, we
may also do the same of Socrates and Pythagoras.
THE DRUIDS PROBABLY PY'1'HAGOREANS._CHAP. IV. SECT. VI.
From the circumstances related of Abaris, and fiom various particulars which have de-
scended to us, we must see, I think, that the Druids were
Pythagoreans. The Essenians,
of whom Philo has written the history, were
confessedly Pythagoreans, and I think we
may
see some traces of these people amongst the Druids. They existed before Christianity,
and lived in buildings called Monasteria or Monasteries, and were called Koinobioi, or
Coenobites. They were of three kinds; some never married, others of them did. They are
most highly spoken ofby all the authors of antiquity who have named them. The cruelties
of the later Druids cannot be pleaded against this, bwause we know how orders of men
have changed in long periods of time; and have, when in circumstances ot' extreme dis-
tress, given way to superstitious of a cruel, absurd, and almost incredible nature.
The pretty and limcitiil doctrine of the harmony of the spheres, as held by Pythagoras,
was held also by the Druids of Ireland. And it is remarkable that the word Pythagoras

signilics literally in Welsh, explication of the universe, or cosmogony, {'i'om the verb
pyt/iagori, to explain the system of the universe.*
The tbllowing is the account given by the Rev. Dr. Collyer of the opinions of Pytha-
goms, whom he makes to say,
"
God is neither the object of sense, nor subject to passion;
but invisible, only intelligible, and supremely intelligent. In his body, he is like the
light, and in his soul he resembles truth. He is the universal spirit that pervades and
difiiiseth itself over all nature. All beings receive their life from him. There is but one
only God, who is not, as some are apt to imagine, seated above the world, beyond the orb
of the universe ; but being himself all in all, he sees all the beings that (ill his immensity,
the only principle, the light of Heaven, the Father of all. He produces every thing, he
orders and disposes every thing ; he is the reason, the life, and the motion of all beings."
These are the notions which Pythagoras has left us of the Deity.1' How beautiliil l
THE CROSS COMMON T0 GREEKS, EGYPTIANS, AND INDIANS.-CH. IV. SECT. VII.
Few causes have been more powerful in producing mistakes in ancient history, than
the idea hastily taken up by Christians in all ages, that every monument of antiquity
marked with a cross, or with any of those symbols which they conceived to be mono-
grams of Christ, were of Christian origin. I believe many of those called Christian an-
tiquities, which cover the walls of the Vatican, have no more relation to Christianity than
they have to the Emperor of China. These are bold assertions, and it is necessary to
substantiate them, in order to elucidate several important points in the following treatise
before I proceed further.
Before all other symbols, the cross has been thought to be the most decisive; when, in
fact, of all symbols it is the most equivocal. It is right to observe that I make a great
distinction between a cross and a human figure nailed to a cross, two things which, under
the name of crucifix, are so often confounded, that now the word crucifix conveys no cer-
tain idea.
Upon several of the most curious of the ancient monuments of Britain, the cross is
found-monuments which this cross alone prevents being ascribed to the Druids. Long
previously to the time of Christ it was, very certainly, in common use amongst the Gen-
tiles: it was sacred with the Egyptians. The Ibis was represented with human hands
and feet, holding the staH` of Isis in one hand, and a
globe and cross in the other. It is
on most of the Egyptian obelisks, and was used as an amulet. Satum's monogram or
symbol was a cross and a ram's horn. Jupiter also bore a cross with a horn: Venus a
circle with a cross.; Justin § says, that Plato, in his Timaeus, philosophising about the
Son of God, reports that he was expressed upon the universe in the _form of the letter X.

Again, that the second power of the supreme God was
figured on the universe in
the shape of a cross. Tertullian says, that the devil signed his soldiers on the fore.
head in imitation of the Christians: "
Mithra signat illic in frontibus milites suos."'
It is related both by Socrates and Sozomon, that when the temple of Serapis at Alex-
andria was demolished by one of the Christian Emperors, beneath the foundation was
discovered the monogram of Christ, and that the Christians made use of the circum-
stance as an
argument in favour of their religion, thereby making many converts.
The Gentiles also used it in their favour; but the Christians had clearly the best of the
argument. The cross
being uneasy under the weight or dominion of the temple over-
threw it. The following are the monograms of Osiris 3 .2.1' They are also the mono-
grams of Jupiter Ammon. This character is to be seen
upon one of the coins of
Decius, the great persecutor of the Christians, with this word upon it BA ,QATQ
This word in the same manner is found on the staH`s of Isis and Osiris. There
is also a medal of Ptolemy, King of Cyrene, having an
eagle carrying a thunder-»bolt
and the cross. On a Phoenician medal, found in the ruins of Citium, and engraved
in Dr. Clark's Travels, (shewn in the vignette at the head of this chapter,) and proved
by him to be Phoenician, are inscribed the cross, the rosary, and the lamb. The follow-
ing is also another form of the same
monogram ,>£|, and X H, signifying the number
DCVIILI All these are monograms of Christ, and are to be met with in great numbers
in almost every church in Italy.
The famous cram ansata is to be seen on all the buildings of Egypt, and is what is
alluded to by Ezekiel.§ The cross is as common in India, as in Egypt and Europe. The
Rev. Mr. Maurice says,
"
let not the piety of the Catholic Christian be offended at the
preceding assertion, that the cross was one of the most usual symbols among the hiero-
glyphics of Egypt and India. Equally honoured in the Gentile and the Christian world-
this emblem of universal nature, of that world to whose four quarters its diverging radii
pointed, decorated the hands of most of the sculptured images in the former country, and
in the latter stamped its fomi upon the most majestic of the shrines of their deities."||
In the cave at Elephanta, in India, over the head of the principal figure, again may be seen
this figure, and a little in the front the huge Lingham.1|` We learn from Mr. Maurice the
curious fact, that the two principal pagodas of India, viz. those of Benares and Mathura,
are built in the form of crosses."

MONOGRAMS OF CHRIST.-°CIIAP. IV. SECT. VIII.
But the most curious of all the monograms of Christ is that inadvertently adopted by
the Protestants, from the Romish monks of the dark ages. It is of no great consequence,
but it is rather curious. As it is used with us, it neither has good nor evil in it.
4>PHpre or p/ire, is a word which Martianus Capella, in his Hymn to the Sun, tells
us was

The following passage I insert trom Mr. Vallencey, though rather long, but it seems

in Yorkshire very well. A naughty or
saucy boy, at school, often gets a smack on the
face.
And this is not the only advantage we shall mp by such an
investigation. Many

are often expressed by a single word, the true signiiication of which is not to be found
in the Hebrew, Chaldean, or Arabic languages : the same words are frequently to be met
with in the Irish MSS., denoting the same
ceremony, and this so described, as to leave no
room for conjecture ; for example, samac, smac, or
smag, in Irish, is the palm oi' the hand.
At the coronation of a
king, or the ordination of a
priest, the chief' priest passed the
s of both hands down the temples of the prince or
priest, and he was then said to
J; hence smacd or smact signifies authority, one set over the people: croich-smacd,
a
government, from crioch, a territory; and, as a verb, smacdom is, to govern. The same
word is used by Moses, when he put Joshua in authority, with the same
ceremony.-
"
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses 'mp smc,
smach'd him, laying his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearlrened unto
him, and did as the Lord commanded unto Moses." A second example is in the
Irish word amarcall, viz. signurn X, that is, the sign with which the emir or noble was
anointed on the forehead between the eyes: it is in the ancient Hebrew, Samaritan,and
Irish X, Thau; and hence arose the offices of the Jewish priests, called Irumorcalim, or

in use by the Druids of Britain, to overthrow the arguments used to prove certain
monuments Christian, from the circumstance alone of their bearing the figure of the
cross.
The very learned Schedius,* speaking of the Druids, confirms all that I have said on
this head. He writes,
"
that they (the Druids) seek studiously for an oak tree, large
and handsome, growing up with two principal arms, in form ofa cross, beside the main
stem upright. If the two horizontal arms are not sudiciently adapted to the figure, they
fasten a cross-beam to it. This tree they consecrate in this manner.
Upon the right
branch they cut in the bark, in fair characters, the word nnsusz upon the middle or
upright stem the word nnssns :
upon the left branch Bnurxus : over this, above the
going off of the arms, they cut the name of God, 'rr-1au:~|' under all the same
repeated
Tuau.
"
This tree so inscribed, they make their kebla in the grove cathedral, or summer church,
toward which they direct their Races in the ofiices of religion, as to the ambre-stone or
the cove in the temples of Abury;$ like as the Christians do to any symbol or
picture
at the altar."
On this Mr. Davies observes, that Arrian, in Bell. Illyr., mentions the Gallican Tau,
in a
passage of his Catalecta, which Ausonius, the Gaulish bard, proposes as an
enigma
to his learned friends. This Tau was the symbol ofthe Druidical Jupiter. It consisted
of a.
great oak, deprived of all its branches, except only two large ones, which,
though cut olf and separated, were
suspended fiom the top of its trunk, like extended
arms.§

The monogram of the Scandinavian Mercury, which was Teutates or Tuisco, was
represented by a cross. The monogram of the Egyptian Taut is formed by three crosses
thus |-11|, united at the feet, and forms to this day the jewel of the royal arch among
freemasonsf*
Speaking ofthe stones of Classerniss, Plate 28, Dr. Macculloch says,
"
Yet it seem;
unquestionable that the figure ofa cross was known to the Gothic nations, and also used
by them before they were converted to Christianity."'|'
In Ireland the large stones are often found to have crosses on them. It has been
supposed that these have been done by Christians; that Christians continuing to pay
their adoration to these stones, in compliance with old custom, after the introduction of
Christianity, the priests caused these crosses to be cut, to divert their adoration to the
cross. It is certain that the populace did continue this superstition even to the seventh
century, as is known from the decrees of councils to prohibit the practice.; The .Even-
Maschitlz, which the Jews were forbidden to worship, was a
bowing-stone. In the Western
isles of Scotland, Martin states, that in the Isle of Barra there is a stone, round which
the inhabitants always go when they come near it, according to the Druid custom. The
story of the Christians cutting crosses I think is nonsense: they evidently shew in
most cases that they are coeval with the stones themselves.
The adoration of the cross has been more
general in the world than that of any other
emblem. It is to be found in the ruins of a fine city of Mexico, near Palenque, where
there are many examples of it amongst the hieroglyphics on the buildings; but one
is very remarkable. On the top of it is placed an idol, in the likeness of a hen, the
hen of Ceres, to which a devotee is making an
offering of an
infant.§
It is curious to observe how the cross is regaining its old place in this country. A
hundred years ago our Protestant females would have been shocked at the idea of wearing
a cross. Now they all have crosses dangling from their necks: and our priests generally
prevail to have it elevated on the tops of our new churches. They say it is not an
object of adoration. True; but all in its proper time. It will not be elevated on the
church and the altar for nothing. A prudent Pope, availing himself of the powers
given to him by the council of Trent, would not 6nd it difiicult to effect a reconciliation
between the Papal See and the Protestant Church of England. The extremes are
beginning to bend to the circular form.

THE OLD NOT MORE THAN' THE NEW TESTAMENT MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED
FROM ERROR.-Cl-IAP. IV. SECT. XI.
I lay it down broadly as a principle not to be disputed, that God has vouchsafed no
greater protection to the law of the Jews than to the law of the Christians-to the Pen-
tateuch than to the Gospels. Now, as it is well known that the Gospels contain a
great
number ofvarious readings, therefore it might he expected that the same would be found on
an examination of the copies or versions of the Pentnteuch; and such is the fact. Surely
it is a most extraordinary mistake in a number of modern theologians, with a learned
bishop at their head, to admit, contrary to all evidence, that the text of the Synagogue
Pentateuch is free from various readings or corruptions, and therefore has been protected
by a constant standing miracle-for this must be the consequence of their admission.
Societies may toil long enough to convert the Jews, that is, most wisely to destroy one
ofthe best arguments in favour of the truth of Christianity; but they will toil in vain, so
long as Christian bishops shall allow to the Rabbies so glorious a
triumph over their
Christian opponents; and I am quite certain that no effort of talent will be spared which
wealth can command, in every country, to place the bishop's argument apparently on n
firm foundation. The Rabbi says,
"
The Synagogue Pentateuch is the word of God. As
might well have been expected, it is protected by a. constant standing miracle, and is free
from error or various reading of any kind. In every synagogue throughout the world it is
the same; and since the days of Moses always has been the same.
(Most sacerdotal and
matchless edrontery !) But look at the Gospels; they have thirty thousand various
readings. If God had inspired the authors of them, he would have taken the same
care of them that he has taken of the inspired Pentateuch. He would have protected
the work of his hand." What answer can the bishop make to this? The Rabbies are
learned, sincere, and zealous in their duty; and I have no doubt have seen the advantage
given them by the bishop; and I have no doubt also, that for some years past, neither
wealth nor zeal has been spared to give a semblance of truth to his unfounded doctrines.
I believe it has had the effect of suppressing the religious schism amongst the Jews
upon this point throughout all Europe! When I see honourable, pious, and learned
bishops making such work, I am tempted with Chaucer to exclaim, W/mt unjieatfyjizl-
lows greatpriests be !
The consistent and reasoning Christian may perhaps say, God works his own ends
by his own means. Who knows but he may have thought proper to make use of our
new school of divines, with the bishop at its head, as an instrument whereby he may

place the religion of the Jews, which in the Pentateuch is declared to be 'ro rnnmr a re-
ligion for ever, on a foundation which cannot be shaken. The argument is specious at
least. The fact on which it is founded too,' the promised durability of their religion, is
unquestionable, and ought long since (even if the cries of justice and benevolence were
heard in vain) to have put an end to the ill treatment of our elder brethren the Jews.
VARIOUS READINGS IN THE PENTATEUCHZ THIS NOT INTENDED T0 TEACH

If the credibility of a miracle be admitted, it is contrary to sound philosophy to admit,
that God will ever perform any miracle more than is necessary for producing the effect

The same argument applies exactly to the case of the various readings of the Pentateuch.
`
f
Now so far from the Pentateuch being iiee from various readings or
corruptzons, (or
half of the various readings at least must be corruptions,) it has in the three original
versions, as I will call them, the Samaritan, the Hebrew, and the Septuagint, various read-

134- MOSAIC CHRONOLOGY.-CHAP. IY. SECT. XIII.
But I am not content that my argument should be considered as
removing the objec-
tion, that is, as it may be said, making an excuse for these difficulties in the text. I go
iiirther. I maintain, assuming that the great object of the Creator was to cause Moses
to give a
system of doctrine and morals to his people, that it is contrary to sound philo.
sophy to expect him to protect the books in any way more than the doctrinal part, so far
only as is necessary for the perfect attainment of his object.
Having premised thus much, I have no hesitation in saying, that the general chro-
nology, as stated in the translation of Jerorn, and in our Bible, is wrong, and cannot
be admitted.
I am
very happy to have with me on this point, a very celebrated and learned orthodox
modern Church-oflEng1and priest of the Evangelical sect. The Rev. Mr. Faber says,
"The more I have considered the early post-diluvian chronology of the Hebrew Pentateuch,
the more convinced I am that the oriental Christians did wisely in rejecting it as
paqmblfq
corrupt and erroneous." I find the foregoing extract amongst some notes relating to Mr.
Faber's works; but I am
sorry to say I have not marked the part of his works from which
it is taken, but I am certain that it is there.
MOSAIC CHRONOI.0GY.='CHAP- IV. SECT. XIII.
The Mosaic chronology has been allowed by divines to be asubject attended with very
great diliiculty: but this has only arisen from the mistaken idea, that because Moses
undertook to give his people a rule of doctrine and morals, he must be held responsible
for every thing in the books which he adopted; nay, indeed, much more than this-that
he must be held responsible for every error of transcribers, or printers, or
corruption of
any kind which might happen to befal the text in all succeeding ages. Now I appre-
hend ifl shew a
single error or
corruption, my position must be admitted. For ii' one
example of error or
corruption be admitted, the book is liable to others. In the following
verses, a
corruption has most clearly taken place: they can be reconciled by no human
ingenuity. The common rules of arithmetic cannot be overthrown.
Gen. xi. 26. And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in
Hamn.
Ch. xii. 1. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy i`ather's house, unto a land that I will shew thee.
4-. So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him: and Lot went with him;
and Abram was
seventy and live years old when he departed out of Haran.
The following is another instance. In the 85th chapter of Genesis, and 22nd verse,
it is said, that the sons of Jacob were twelve. It then gives their names, including Ben-
jamin: and in the twenty-sixth verse it states, that these sons were born to him in
¢
OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAST SECTION.°~CHAP. IV. SECT. XIV. 155
Mesopotamia, or Padan-Aram. But at the sixteenth verse the birth of Benjamin is
stated to have taken place at Ephrath in Canaan. After Jacob left Padan-Aram, he
lived at Sechem, and bought land there; and afterward lived at Bethel, whence he
removed before Benjamin was born: so that it is evident several years passed between
his removal from Mesopotamia and the birth of Benjamin. It is perfectly clear, that
there is here a mistake of the text, whence it follows that the triumph of the Rabbies is
destitute of solid foundation. There is probably here the interpolation of the word
D18 |792 fbpdn armj in Padua-Aram, from a
marginal note, before the Septuagint
was made!
OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAST SECTION.-CHAP. IV. SECT. XIV.
Such are the texts which have made men like Mr. Paine and Mr. Voltaire unbe-
lievers. They could not shut their eyes to the corruption of the received text. And
the priests, having a favourite dogma to support which must be given up if they defended
their religion, as
might have been expected, most
improperly sacrificed the latter to the
former. The Christian who uses his reason would say, We do not hold that I/le whole of
that book is the inspired word ofGod, but we hold that the whole inspired word of God is
in that book; it is under precisely the same circumstancesas every other book, not except-
ing the Gospels; all are liable to mistakes of transcribers, misprints, and corruption. No
miracle has been worked to preserve them. In this doctrine, I believe I am
supported
by the Roman church. From all this I draw the conclusion, that the passages which I
have pointed out, being irreconcileable, are
evidently the effect of corruption, and there-
fore no part of the text. In the first of the examples above, my argument receives a
remarkable confirmation from the Samaritan version, which corrects the Hebrew, and
states that the age of Terah was not 205 ymrs, but only I4-5, as it ought to be. From
the whole of this argument it follows, that errors in chronology or natural philosophy
can never impugn the Mosaic, that is virtually, the Christian doctrine; and therefore
that in this case, when the Christian religion is placed on its proper footing, it can never
be found to be irreconcileahle with the doctrines of sound philosophy or the progress of
science. Therefore, if my deductions should not agree with modern systems of chrono-
logy, as expounded by any set of priests, I shall not trouble myself; as
they can
certainly
never be construed into a
charge against religionsl'
The first of these texts, I was
lately told by a friend, had been explained satisfactorily
by Dr. Adam Clark; I therefore looked into his translation with great eagerness, when

136 OBSERVATIONS ON' THE LAST SECTION.-_CHAP. IY. SECT. XIV.
to my astonishment I found the old system at work-a heap of sophistical trash, but
the damning fact, that the old version, the Samaritan, corrects the Hebrew, suppressed!
Not a word of notice is taken of it. Is this candid or ingenuous? I amrm, that when a
n is treatin on such a subject in the form of a note of eleucidation, he cannot
ma g
honestly suppress any information which is known to him relative to it; and that, if
he do suppress such information, he is guilty of a pious fraud. Dr. Geddes, in his trans-
lation, has honestly corrected the corruption from the Samaritan version, and has
written 14-5.'
The other example is so perfectly clear, that neither Dr. Geddes, Dr. Clark, nor
Mr. Wellbeloved, in their new translations, has attempted any explanation, except
merely to subjoin in a note the words all bu! Beryhmin; which is an admission of the
corruption, not an endeavour to explain it. Mr. Bellamy, than whom perhaps no man
is more learned in the Hebrew language, has not noticed lt. One example is sulfcient
for my argument. It was first observed, I believe, by Dr. Shuckburg, who has truly
observed, that nothing can reconcile the contradiction.
I am the more surprised at the Rev. Dr. Clark, because he is not nice or accustomed
to stop at little things; and I think the reader will justify me in saying this, when I
inform him, that the Doctor would throw out of the book the iirst five verses of
Deuteronomy.
If a philosopher, Sir W. Drummond for instance, attempt to explain a few words
figuratively the ultra pietists make a terrible outcry: but when it suits their own pur-
)
pose, it seems they can take liberties enough. Sir W. Drummond never took half so
°
f th
great a liberty with the text, as is the attempt to expunge the most important part o e
book of Deuteronomy. I say most important part, for without it the whole of the
remainder is nonsense.
Notwithstanding that the Doctor professes to give a translation, he does not appear to
have the least idea of the general nature or character of this history. Unless indeed, he
has a wish, in support of a
particular dogma, by suppressing these verses to change its
general character-to change it by the practice of what Bishop Marsh calls "conjectula
theologica."

One ot' the leading articles of the religion of the Druids, the creation of matter, was
contrary to that of most of the ancient philosophers. Their doctrine appears at first to
be supported by the patriarchal book of Genesis; but this is not the fact. That book
delivers no
opinion upon the subject. The word which we translate create in the first
verse of' Genesis, only means to
_fb/-rn, as it is very correctly interpreted in the Greek
version of the Seventy. All the researches of Geologists prove beyond the possibility
of dispute, that the world was not fomred, as it now is, in the short period of six
days. Then does this prove Genesis false? Certainly not. It only proves that the
expression which we have been accustomed to consider literally, ought to be taken
figuratively. This history is found amongst the Magi of Persia, (not of Babylon,) who
were ot' the same
religion as Abraham and his family in their day, and they say that the
world was formed not in six days, but in six periods of time. This is the meaning of
Genesis. And the order of time in which the different beings of which the earth con-
sists are said in it to have been formed, exactly agrees with the discoveries of geology.
In a
very peculiar and curious manner
they confirm one another.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to observe, that the crust of the earth consists of a
great
variety of strata, which have evidently some time or other been regularly placed in layers
or
separate beds; and have been formed either by chemical or mechanical processes at
different periods and at long intervals of time from one another. Geologists with great
labour and perseverance have examined them, and have ascertained the order in which
these strata have been formed. In their inquiries all theory has been excluded, and
nothing but fhct and experiment have been depended upon; fi-om which circumstance
their discoveries receive much additional probability. Indeed, the probability is so
strong as to amount to almost a mathematical certainty. In these strata, the organic
remains of a vast variety of animals, are found: but in none of them, except in the very
latest, are there to be met with the remains of a
single quadruped contemporary with man,
according to the account of the creation given by Moses. It is also perfectly clear, that
these fossil remains have been embedded in the respective strata previously to the con-
vulsions of the earth, which have broken them and thrown them into the confiision in
which they are at present found. It is also clear, that they have all, or most of them,
been the effects of slow mechanical and chemical causes, and certain{y not of one opera-
tion like that of the deluge of Genesis, as has been supposed by some
persons. It is
very curious to observe the gradations of animated beings, which are found in the
diE'erent strata. The fishes are in the most remote, or along with the oviparous quadru.
peds. After these follow the mammiferous, but not till long afterward; not until the
strata of limestone had been formed, which contain the shells, most of the genera of

which are now perfectly extinct. After the formation of the limestone strata here
spoken of, and upon them are found, in alluvial beds, the remains of great numbers of
animals entirely unknown to us.
CUVIER ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH.-CHAI-'. IV. SECIZXVI.
M. Cuvier says,
"
It is clearly ascertained that the oviparous quadrupeds are found
considerably earlier, or in more ancient strata, than those of the viviparous class. Thus
the crocodiles of Honfleur and of England, are found immediately beneath the chalk.
The great alligators or crocodiles and the tortoises of Maestricht are found in the chalk
formation, but these are both marine animals. This earliest appearance of fossil bones
seems to indicate, that dry lands and fresh waters must have existed before the formation
of the chalk strata; yet neither at that early epoch, nor during the formation of the chalk
strata, nor even for a
long period afterwards, do we find any fossil remains of mammgfzrous
land quadrupeds. We begin to find the bones of rnammiferous sea animals, namely, of the
Lamentin and of Seals, in the coarse shell-limestone, which immediately covers the chalk
strata in the neighbourhood of Paris. But no bones of mammiferous land quadrupeds are
tobe found in that formation; and, notwithstanding the most carefiil investigations, I
have never been able to discover the slightest trace of this class, excepting in the forma-
tions which lie over the coarse limestone strata: but on reaching these more recent for-
mations, the bones of land quadrupeds are discovered in great abundance. As it is
reasonable to believe, that shells and fish did not exist at the period of the formation ot'
the primitive rocks, we are also led to conclude, that the oviparous quadnxpeds began to
exist along with the fishes, while the land quadrupeds did not begin to appear till long
afterwards, and until the coarse shell-limestone had been already deposited, which con-
tains the greater part of our genera of shells, although of quite different species from those
that are now found in a natural state. There is also a determinate order observable in the
disposition of these bones with regard to each other, which indicates a
very remarkable
succession in the appearance of' the different species. All the genera which are now
unknown, as the palaaotheria, anapalmotheria, Src., with the localities of which we are
thoroughly acquainted, are found in the most ancient of the formations of which we are
now treating, or those which are placed directly over the coarse limestone strata. It is
chiefly they which occupy the regular strata which have been deposited from fresh waters,
or certain alluvial beds of very ancient formation, generally composed of sand and
rounded pebbles.
"
The most celebrated of the unknown species belonging to known genera, or to genera
nearly allied to those which are known, as the fossil elephant, rhinoceros, hippopo-
tamos, and mastodon, are never found with the more ancient genera, but are
only con-
tained in alluvial formations.
OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAST SEC'1'ION'._-CHAP. IV. SECT. XVII. 189
"
Lastly-the bones of species which are
apparently the same with those that still exist
alive, are never found except in light and alluvial depositions."
OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAST SECTION.-CHAP. IV. SECT. XVII.
After a due consideration of this extract from M. Cuvier, the truth of which no one
disputes, it seems to me diflicult to believe that the most credulous of the ultra-pietists
can attribute the effects here pointed out to the momentary operation of one cause, like
the flood of Noah. How comes it to pass, that all species of land animals, including
man, are not to be found mixed together, instead of being found in classes? How comes
it to pass, that so
many kinds of fishes are become extinct? The flood would surely not
destroy them ! Then how come they to be found embedded in strata
evidently formed
previous to the breaking of the outer coats of the earth, and prior to the deluge described
in Genesis P-for so they evidently are. And why is there no instance of the remains of
man, or of any animals now living, amongst the fossil shells, &c., of the earliest strata?
All these facts prove to demonstration, that the creation of the earth and that of its
inhabitants have taken place at times extremely remote from one another, and not in the
space of six days, as we usually misunderstand it to be represented in Genesis.
It is a circumstance singularly confirmatory of the great age, as well as of the slow
formation of the present state of the earth, and of the beings who have inhabited it, that
there are indubitahle proofs, that between the formations of the respective strata, very
great and violent convulsions must have taken place; "
That in order to mineralize these
successive deposits, some cause or causes, probably chemical, must uniformly have been
employed, which have had the collateral effect of destroying the animals whose nature
and organs fitted them to exist upon the surface of the last deposit, and unfitted them for
the next."*
It has been justly observed by our priests, that this exhibits in the order of succession
a
striking proof of the truth of the Mosaic account, considering, as I have done, the word
day to mean
only a
period of time. The succession of formations is exactly that of
Moses.
The Quarterly Reviewer, the very leamed, able, and staunch friend, not only of religion,
but of the present system and order of things exactly as they now are, says upon this, with

truly pious Christian, who, after all the lights thrown
upon the subject of geology in modern times, shall feel himself bound by the letter, as he
conceives it, of the Mosaic text, to accept, as an article of faith, a creation limited by six
days of twenty-four hours each, are entitled to respect; yet it ought to be remembered,
that the question does not affect the question of the inspiration or the veracity of Moses,

but merely tums on the meaning of a
very equivocal and uncertain term. And if it can
be made appear that the word :11 [inm]* the legitimate parent of the Latin dies, cannot
in this instance be restricted to any definite period, and still more if the latest discoveries
have shewn that the work of creation was
really of long duration: but above all, if :bg
order in which organized remains are found in successive strata, is, by a
wonderful coin-
cidence, such as to throw the strongest light on the Mosaic account, we shall arrive at our
author's attempted conclusion by a much clearer and more
satisfactory route."1' The
reviewer adds,-" That the successive order in which these organized remains are dis-
covered, while they are not to be accounted for by the confusion occasioned by a
single
disruption of the earth's surface, are so
relatively situated in the strata where they are dis-
covered, as to aH`ord the strongest confirmation to the Mosaic account of the order in which
they were
severally created." This argument of the Editor of the Quarterly Review is
perfectly good ; but it must not be considered to be the mere ipse dixit of an
anonymous
and unknown author. This periodical work is well known to be the organ ofthe High-
church party in Britain, and the late Mr. Gifford, the conductor of it, without whose
approbation nothing was admitted into it, to have been a man of great learning and talent.
MEANING OF THE FIRST VERSE OF GENESIS.-°CHAP. IV. SECT. XVIII.
When it is maintained that Genesis only teaches that the world was
formed; priests,
who hardly ever give themselves time to think, say-Then you would conclude that as
Moses did not say matter was created, but only formed into its present shape, he taught
that it was eternal, and that is a doctrine which leads to Atheism. He taught no such
thing. The geological observations of Cuvier prove, that it must have been brought
into its present state by a series of operations, after long periods of time. And when
Moses declared it to be formed by God out of pre-existent matter, he gave no opinion on
the guestion of its etemity-he left it untouched. It was not necessary for his object, and
it would be the acme of absurdity to draw the conclusion that he inferred that doctrine
because he gave no opinion. When he used the word 8183 barn, he meant by that
word what the Septuagint declares he did mean, ¢1r¢n-qc-sv, farmed. and What is þÿP ¬1'f¢Cf|Y
consistent with the discoveries of philosophyand modern science. But in thus using it, he
did not declare himself against the opposite doctrine, and thus, as he gave no opinion, the
Druids can
hardly be said to support him or be supported by him, or by the author of
the book called Genesis, which he thought proper to adopt. Whether it were the opinion

DOCTRINES OF PYTHAGORAS.*CHAP. IV. SECT. XX. 141
of Moses, I know not, because he has nowhere given an
opinion about it; but in not
believing that matter was eternal, the Druids seem to have varied in opinion from the
Persian school, in almost this one
solitary instance?
When I consider all the variety of cases of resemblance between the family of Abra-
ham, and these very ancient patriarchal priests, whom I have no hesitation whatever to
place long prior to the time of Moses, I cannot help thinking, that their disagreement
with the Pythagorean, and most of the ancient philosophers, on this peculiar subject of
the creation of matter, has a
very strong tendency to raise a
suspicion, that although the
author of Genesis has given no
opinion on the subject, yet that he agreed with them-
that it was his doctrine. The Druids appear to me to have been toto carlo of the same
school with Abraham.-Mr. Selden has made this observation before.
ETERNITY OF MATTER.-°CHAP. IV SECT. XIX.
Some philosophers say, matter is eternal-I reply, this is a mere
gratis dictum. They
say, We know from experience, or
through the medium of the senses, tire only means
by
so/rich we can
acquire ideas, that it exists. It is your part to prove that it has ever not
existed. I rejoin, Experience teaches me to know that no effect arises without a cause:
this is an invariable law confirmed by experience; therefore, as matter exists, there must
have been a cause for it; hence it must have been created, and by a Creator. The philo-
sopher rejoins, Your Creator must have required a Creator. True; if the Creator con-
sist of matter, or if he be analogous to any thing of which we have experience; but as we
cannot know that he consists of matter, or that he is analogous to any thing of which we
have experience, and as we can
acquire no ideas of any thing except through the medium
of our senses, or of experience, we can know nothing respecting his mode of existence,
therefore can draw no conclusions as to his nature from analogy or experience; and
consequently cannot conclude that he may want a Creator, as
you allege. The result
of this argument is, that as the Creator has not informed us
respecting, or
given-us
power to understand, the nature of himself-of his mode qf e.z-istence, we know nothing
about it, and can draw no conclusion from it, i. e. can draw no conclusion from a
thing of which we are in fact ignorant, to the prejudice of the conclusion which we have
drawn above from experience, i. e. from a
thing about which we have information.
DOCTRINES OF PYTHAGORAS.'-'CHAIR IV. SECT. XX.
The eternity of matter is a well-known tenet of the Pythagoreans, and whether right
or
wrong, there can be no doubt that it was the doctrine of the oriental school, whence
0

I4-2 nocraruns or rvrrraoonas.-cnar. rv. sscr. xx.
Pythagoras drew his learning. It was a principle taken or mistaken from, or found
amongst, the débris of that mighty mass of learning and science of a former period,
of which, on looking back as far as human ken can reach, the most learned men have
thought that they could see a faint glimmering. Indeed, I think I may say something
more than a faint glimmering. For all the really valuable moral and philosophical doc-
trines which we possess, Mons. Dutens has shewn to have existed there. The vases of
the Etruscans shew the delicacy of their taste. Of their mechanic arts, we seem
only to
have retained one or two examples. The potters' wheel we owe to them, and it is the
most simple, the most perfect, and the most complete of all the instruments ofthe world.
It never has been improved, and it admits of no
improvement.
When we look at the history of man, almost every thing we see tells us, that he is an
animal, but of ten or eleven thousand years,-but of yesterday. When we look at the
world, its fossils, its various strata, we see signs of age and longevity; every thing be-
speaks a
long-extended period of time. Let the person who doubts the age of the world,
draw up one of the piles driven into the Danube by Trajan, and see how far in it the
process of fossillization has proceeded, and then perhaps he may be able to approximate,
in a
slight degree, towards the formation of an idea of the time which must have elapsed
since the creation of the fossil fishes.
An unceasing war has been kept up between Christian priests and philosophers. The
latter could not shut their eyes to the volumeofnature which layopen before them,-the for-
mer having made a false translation, have considered that every thingdear to them depended
upon its support. It is time to put an end to this absurd contention. There is no ground
for it. Moses has wisely abstained from giving an opinion upon this point of natural
history, and in spite of priests, the two expressions to which we have been alluding in the
first book of Genesis, are perfectly consistent with all our knowledge and experience.
The priests cannot here fix Moses, or the author of Genesis, with an absurdity.
It is a most unjust thing to make the author of Genesis' give an opinion upon a
point,

and Kennicot's am-rbur readings. And the mod ancient of the versions, namely, tim: in the Samaritan language,

a
gratuitous opinion uncalled ibr, which militates against all our
experience. It isa down-
right wicked thing thus to misrepresent him. For the sake of argument, let it be granted
me that the text is doubtful. This is the utmost that priests can
say, (but I do not
admit it,) then I mantain that the text ought, in common justice to the author of it, to be
construed in the way which makes him consistent with natural philosophy. The pride
of man has been unwilling to allow that his faculties are not
adequate to measure or to
fathom the question respecting the eternity of matter, and, too proud to confess his weak-
ness, he has called in Moses to remove his diiiiculty. The object of Moses was to give
to his people a code qfIam, a rule qffait/I and morals, not a treatise on natural history.
FURTHER OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING GENESIS.-CRAP. IV. SECT. XXI.
The Septuagint is the oldest translation of the book oi' Genesis, from the Hebrew,
which we
possess. It was made by the direction of Ptolemy Philadelphus, 24.6 years
before Christ, the Jewish high priest lending his assistance to the making of it. Now it is
impossible not to believe that the men
employed to make it, and their employers also,
must have known whether the important word under consideration should mean
_/brmed
or created. There are no various readings to make it doubtful; all the copies of the
Seventy have it the same. It is the only authority to which we can
go; the other trans-
lations and paraphrases are of a date comparatively recent, and have been made by
Christian or Jewish priests, to enable them to silence, as
they absurdly thought, the argu-
ments ofthe philosophers-arguments which they ought not to have attempted to answer,
because they are
arguments upon a subject beyond the reach of our faculties. In the short
and clear argument which I have given, I have proved the existence of God. I think it
cannot he overthrown; though by arguing in a. manner similar to that of BishopBerkeley,
when he attempts to prove that matter does not exist at all, man
may confound his own
understanding. But that will not aE`ect my position, and therefore I conclude, that as
God exists, if the doctrine of the eternity of matter impugn that position, the doctrine is
false; matter has not existed from eternity; and this is a fair and logical argument. If
God create matter, he must give it form; but it does not follow that if he form matter, he
at that time, or in that operation, must create it. He may form from matter
pre-existing,
as a potter makes a
cup from pre-existent clay. One word more I am induced to ofer on
the word created. If the reader will examine the 'first book of Genesis attentively, he will
see that it is absolutely necessary to construe it, jbrmedand not created, to make the book
consistent with itselil The word ;~t'|&3 bara, or create, is used repeatedly in the sense
of formed, matter having been previously created; for instance, in verse 21, he created
great whales. In the 27th verse of the first chapter, it says, God created man. In the
7th verse of the second chapter, it says, that man was composed of the dust of the earth.
These texts are in no way contradictory when the word bara is properly translated, and
the book not made a sacrifice to the dogmas of priests,-not made use of as a tool to
Q22-
I4--1° FURTHER GBSEBVATIONS RESPECTING GENESIS.1CHAP. IV. SECT. XXI.
support a favourite, pre-conceived doctrine, which they think that by this means they
can establish ; but which is not necessary either to doctrine or morals to be established.
In order to guard myself against the outcry of ignorance and stupidity, I think it
-necessary to observe, that I am supported in my view of this text by some of the most
learned modem divines, and amongst them by Beausobre, the celebrated French Pro-
testant, one of whose works is so
highly esteemed at Cambridge as to form a standard
book of lecture or examination for honours. He says,
"
The Hebrew having been for
many years a dead language, it is ditlicult to estimate with certainty the powers of its
phrases. This is an observation which Maimonides has somewhere made in his More
Nevochim. The true signitication of it, then, can be known only by application to the
Chaldee paraphrases and the ancient versions. But the paraphrases and the versions
have never attached to the word Bora the idea of a production of matter from nothing.
Of this we
may be assured by reference to the paraphrases, and by consulting concord-
ances and dictionaries."*
Upon this subject I shall say no more. Enough has been said to satisly every Christian
of liberal and enlarged understanding. It is not to be expected that the fashionable
ultra-pietists of the day, who so
loudly celebrate one another's praises at every Bible and
Missionary meeting, will be able to understand the argument used either by me or the
Reviewer, simple as it is. But I think it necessary to point out, that it has one quality
which ought to make it in a peculiar manner valuable to every sincere professor of
Christianity, which is, that it leaves the sacred writings open to the exertions of their
friends to reconcile, in any way they think right, the dimculties which appear in them.
If they think they want no reconciliation, or if they can reconcile them, very well; but
if they cannot-if their argument fail-my argument is good, and religion untouched.
It cannot be supposed that when I receive pleasure from the explanation of a difficult
passage in the frivolous works of Virgil or Horner, I should not receive pleasure from
the removal of a
diiliculty from the important books of the Penmteuch.
Perhaps it will be said, that these observations are all unnecessary in an
essay on the
Druids, and that I am making it merely a vehicle to divulge religious opinions. This is
not correct: it will be seen that they are
absolutely necessary when we come to treat of
the antiquity of these people; unless indeed I let persons run
away with the idea that
my observations are contrary to the Mosaic dispensation, which they do not impugn but
support; and therefore I must request my reader to suspend his judgment for the
present.

In the last Section of the Second Chapterl made some observations upon Mr. O'Con-
nor's Chronicles of Eri, and his mode of peopling countries. I there said I should return
to him. I will now have one word more with that gentleman. I am inclined to think,
probably from reading Mr. Hume's profound philosophical treatise on Miracles, that
he is not a believer in them. Perhaps I am as little a believer in many of those so called,
as Mr. O'Connor. I cannot bring myselfto think that God is always ready to come fi-gm
heaven whenever any old monk wants his cloak or his breeches mending, or for any
other of the unworthy objects for which he has been so often used. Mr. Hume's ai-gn.
ment against miracles is I think this, in very short terms: "
We know nothing but from
experience, and we have no experience of a miracle, and therefore a miracle cannot be
believed." Now I think no person can read M. Cuvier's observations respecting the
formation of animals, &c., at different intervals, (which in the main part are
absolutely
indisputable,)-can look at the different strata of the earth, and not see that for each
new formation there must have been an exertion of divine power. Now this exertion is
a miracle; and we know this through the medium of our senses, which is experience:
therefore, as we have experience of one miracle, it is no
ways unphilosophical to believe
another, or
any other miracle, which is not unworthy of the Divine power, and which is
not contrary to its moral attributes. This then evidently opens the door to the con-
sideration of the peculiar miracles of Jesus Christ, which, in this argument, was
before closed. And the question will be, not whether a miracle be credible or not,
because that must now be admitted, but iirst, whether these peculiar miracles were or
were not contrary to the Divine attributes. Secondly, whether the occasion for which
they were performed was of sutiicient consequence to warrant a belief of the Divine in-
terference: and lastly, whether the evidence for their actual performance be suiiiciently
clear. I consider a miracle to be a
special divine interference, to change the mode of
existence of any existing creature. The word creature I use in opposition to Creator:
in other words, an
irregular or unnatural change, by power, of the natural mode of
the existence of matter. -
This argument is very short: I trust it is not the worse for its brevity. Almost
hundreds of folios have been written to refiite Mr. Hume. Scarcely a
year passes in
which the press does not groan beneath the weight of some
ponderous work in reply to
him, the very repetition of which would seem to shew, that however the church may be
pleased with the zeal which prompts the answer, she is not quite satisfied with the re-
fixtation. It would be vain in me to assume that I have succeeded against this renowned
philosopher better than others; but at all events I may be permitted to record the expres-
sion of my own
inability to discover any way by which my argument can be overthrown!

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION' RESPECTING CHBONOLOGY.-CHAIR IV. SECT. XXIII.
There is no subject which has engaged the attention of learned men more than that of
chronology, and there is probably no subject on which there has been, and is yet, a
greater diB`erence of opinion. If we assume that Moses possessed any thing of the nature
of divine inspiration, it is perfectly clear that he never could intend, in compiling the
hooks of Genesis, to hand down to all tiiture ages a complete system of chronology.
This is proved by the circumstance which I have shewn, that the diferent versions of
the book vary very greatly; that in fact the book has fallen into such a state of' decay
with respect to this matter, that it is totally impossible to reconcile either the versions
or the texts in the same versions to one another: but this has really nothing to do with
Christianity, and can never atfect its credit with any persons except those who are so
absurd as to maintain that every word and letter of some one of the versions, which he
may be pleased to select, has been preserved from the casualties to which the Gospels
and all other things in this world are liable-persons in fact so absurd, as in reality and
substance to maintain that 75 and 70 make 205, which their doctrine, amongst many
other absurdities, drives them to.
I repeat, it is utterly inconsistent with sound philosophy to admit that God, in the
production of an eE`ect, will ever exert power too little or too much. No, he will exert
precisely enough, and no more: then how absurd is it, if it be admitted that the objects
of Moses and Jesus were doctrine and morals only, to believe He would give a
system of
geology, chronology, or astronomy ! If the ultra-pietist say it was the object of God to
give a
system of chronology, I have done with him. He is not of my Christianity. I
reason no more with him; but address myself to the more rational Christian-the
Christian whom I can call my fellow, who has no objection to his religion being con-
sistent with reason and common sense.
WHEN LETTERS ARRIVED IN BR.I'.l'AIN.*»CHAP. IV. SECT. XXIY.
Although we have had a
good deal of discussion on the origin of letters, yet of the
time when they arrived in Britain I have studiously avoided all mention, reserving it
to this part oi' my work, where I thought it would be better placed. We have already
ascertained that the Phosnicians* traded to Britain before the time of Homer, 1100 years
levant to my subject, but their novelty and importance have tempted me to intrude them upon my mder; their
shortn I hope will plead my excuse.

SIR W. DRUMMOND RESPECTING CHRONOLOGY.--CHAP. IV. SECT. XXV. ll-7
before Christ; but I think we can fix them a little earlier. We have seen that thc
Phmnicians, or persons from the East, brought an
alphabet to Greece, consisting of
sixteen or seventeen letters. Now we must conclude, that if they had been in the habit
of using more, they would have brought more; but the Pfentatéuch is written with
twenty-two letters, consequently the number must have been increased after the Cad-
mean alphabet went to Greece: and as Moses compiled the Pentateuch about 1500 years
before Christ, the Cadmean alphabet must have come
away to Greece more than |500
years before that time, because if it had come
away later, it would have had the twenty-
two letters used by Moses. It is impossible to believe that if the Phaanicians had been
in the habit of using twenty-two letters, they would not have brought them all, but would
only have brought the sixteen or seventeen.
Now I have before shewn, Chap. I. Sect. XII., that the Irish had only sixteen or se-
venteen letters; and it is impossible to doubt that this is the same
alphabet or
system of
letters as the Greek and Phoenician. I conclude, whether it be derived from the Greek or
Phoenician, or
any other language, the parent ofthese two, it must have come
away before
the time when they were increased; that is, at the latest 1500 years before Christ: how
much before this time I do not at present attempt to say, From this I draw the conclusion,
that whether Britain were
peopled by colonies ofPhoenicians coming by sea, or by a
cast
from the Celtic hive coming from Gaul, the peopling took place at least 1500 years
before Christ: and provided it be conceded (which I think cannot be denied), that the
ancient Britons had only seventeen letters, then I draw this conclusion, in spite of all
systems of Chronology, however specious they may appear. The circumstantial evi-
dence of the number of letters overrides all positive testimony whatever. I have shewn
that it must have divided from the parent stock 1500 years before Christ at the latest:
how much earlier I have not attempted to shew; but it is evident that a
great allowance
must be made in addition to the 1500; for it is fair to conclude that some years must
have elapsed between the increase of the alphabet and its coming away. It is very
absurd to suppose that it would be increased the day alter the alphabet had separated to
go to Greece. In the same
way with respect to the British isles, we cannot determine
how much earlier than the 1500 years before Christ they may have come. It is however
only reasonable to believe that the time`must have been considerable.
SIR WM. DRUMMOND RESPECTING CHBONOLOGY._-CRAP. IV. SECT. XXV.
The following extracts from the learned and ingenious treatise of Sir William Drum-
mond, on the Zodiacs of Esné and Dendera, will give as
good an account, in very few
words, of the state of the ancient systems of chronology as
any thing which I can
say:
"The world, as I have just stated, has been created 5824. years, according to the re-
ceived chronology. It has been created 6065 years, according to the Samaritan text-
I 2
14-8 SIR. W. DRUMMOND BESPECTING CHRON0L0GY.1CI-IAP. IV. SECT. XXV.
7210 years, according to the Septuagint-and 7.508 years, according to the testimony of
Josephus. The received chronology is founded on a literal, but, as I conceive, a mis-
taken, interpretation of the Hebrew text....... To the authorities which
I have quoted, are opposed the version of Jerom, the traditions of .the Rabbins, and the
present state of the Hebrew text.....
The IVIasters in Israel are not agreed
among themselves about the chronology of the Bible, the age of the world being now*
5571 years, according to the Seder Olam Sutha; 5878 years, according to Maimonides ;
5574- years, according to Gersom; about 6000 years, according to the Asiatic Jews.
. . . . _ _ Those then who adhere to the present Hebrew text, but who read
it, as I think I have shewn it ought to be read, will reckon not less than 6562 years
from the creation to the present time. For my own part, however, I do not scruple to
adopt the chronology of the Seventy, and to
assign a
period of 7210 years frgm the Crea.
tion to the year 1820 of the Christian aara. This period is thus divided-2962 years
from the creation to the deluge, and 3128 years from the deluge to the birth of Christ."'\'
And now I take the liberty of asking Sir W. Drummond why he adopts the chrono-
logy ofthe Seventy? I will give the answer. Because he finds himself limited for
room, and wishing, as he thinks, to support the Bible as far as possible, he takes the
longest term.
Thus we have seen that the learning of the East came to the British isles more than
1.500 years previously to the Christian sera. Before I finish this work I feel confident
I shall prove, that it existed before the time assigned to the flood, even according to
Sir William Drummond's favourite system of the Seventy, and that it is probable it came
/zere before the time assigned to that event.

CHAPTER V.
FESTIVALS REMOVED BY THE PR:-:cEssIoN or' THE 1-zqumoxgs.-sgg-f, L
EITHER from'the custom not being prevalent of placing inscriptions upon their
temples, or from their destruction by natural decay, or an attention to the prohibition
to use tools, expressed in Deutronomy xxvii. 5, or fiom some other unknown cause,
few are found upon the ancient monuments of Britain or Ireland. Though this is un-
ate for the search after the authors of these monuments, yet we are not entirely
without a resource-a resource, in fact, better than inscriptions, if they were no more
available than those found at Hella, or the hieroglyphics of Egypt. Etymology, or the
identity of the names of places, rivers, gods, or the continued celebration of the same
festivals, will aH`ord a
very good substitute for inscriptions, perhaps so
good as to leave
us little room to regret the want of them.
It was well known to ancient astronomers, that a certain slow periodical revolution
of the pole of the equator took place round the pole of the ecliptic ; and that this perio-
dical revolution was
completed in 25,920 years. The fact was known to the ancients,
and has been demonstrated by modern astronomers, by means both of theory and obser-
vation; so that it is not, at this time, a matter of doubt. In consequence of this circular
motion of the earth, the equinox, the solstice, or
any other fixed moment of the year,
fortun

takes place each year a little previously to the time it took place in the year preceding;
on which account this effect is called the precession of the equinoxes. In viewing the
sun in the belt of the zodiac, compared with any iixed star, at the time of the equinox,
solstice, Src., he falls every year a little short of the place he occupied the preceding year,
and keeps falling short of it each year an additional equal space, till he gets entirely
round the heavens to the same point again. Now, as the circle of the heavens is divided
into 860 parts or degrees# it is evident, that it will take 72 years tbr the equinox to
recede or precede for one degree, and 2160 for one sign or thirty degrees, and 25,990 for
the whole twelve signs of the zodiac, or 860 degrees.
In Chap. IV. Sect. XXIV., by a comparison of the alphabets of different nations, I
have succeeded in shewing that the Celtae and Druids must have come to this country
more than 1500 years before Christ. I shall now proceed to prove, from the remains of
the festivals of the Druids still observed in Britain, that they must have been here at a
much earlier period. The Rev. Mr. Maurice, in his learned work on the Antiquities of
India, has shewn, in a
way which it is impossible to contradict, that the festival and the
may-pole of Great Britain, with its garlands, Src., known to us all, are the remains of an
ancient festival of Egypt and India, and probably of Phaanicia, when these nations, in
countries very distant, and from times very remote, have all, with one consent, celebrated
the entrance of the sun into the sign of Taurus at the vernal equinox; but which, in
consequence of the precession, just mentioned, is removed far in the year from its
original situation. This festival, it appears from a letter in the Asiatic Researc/zes,1°
from Col. Pearce, is celebrated in India on the first of May, in honour of Bhavani (a
personification of Vemal Nature, the Dea Syria of Chaldea, and the Venus Urania ot
.
.
_

Persia). A may-pole is erected, hung with garlands, around which the young peop e
dance recisely the same as in England. The object of the festival, I think with Mr.
P
Maurice, cannot be disputed, and that its date is coeval with a time when the equinox
actually took place on the first of May. He says,
"
Now the vernal equinox, after the
rate of that precession, certainly could not have coincided with the tirst of May, less than
'
'

I
4-000 years before Christ, which nearly marks the aera of the creation. The facts,
think, with Mr. Maurice, cannot be disputed. To account for them consistently with
received chronology, he says,
"
When the reader calls to mind what has already been observed, that owing to the
precession of the equinoxes, after the rate of seventy-two years to a degree, a total
tl mrs
alteration has taken place through all the signs of the ecliptic, insomuch that iose s
which formerly were in Aries have now got into Taurus, and those of Taurus into
Gemini ; and when he considers also the difference before mentioned, occasioned by the
reform of the calendar, he will not wonder at the disagreement that exists in respect to
'
The muse of which was pointed out in the lirst Chapter, Sect. VII. 'I' Val- IL P- 333-
run ssunurz IN rxnra .urn rnnsra.-cnap. v. sam, rr, 1,51
the exact period of the year on which the great festivals were
anciently kept. and that on
which, in imitation of primaeval customs, they are celebrated by the modems. Now the
vernal equinox, after the rate of that precession, certainly could not have ¢0in¢id¢d with
the first of May less than four thousand years before Christ, which nearly marks the ara
of the creation, which, according to the best and wisest chronologers, began at the vemal
equinox, when all nature was
gay and smiling, and the earth arrayed in its loveliest
verdure, and not, as others have imagined, at the dreary autumnal equinox, when that
nature must necessarily have its beauty declining, and that earth its verclure decaying.
I have little doubt, t/ierqfbre, t/rat May-day, or at least tire day on ro/rick t/ie sun entered
Taurus, /ras been immemo/'a6{y /cept as a
saered_/2'stival_/rom t/re creation ofthe earth and
man, and was
originally intended as a memorial of that auspicious period and that
momentous event.""'
He afterward adds, "
On the general devotion of the ancients to the worship of the
bull, I have had frequent occasion to remark, and more
particularly in the Indian history,
by their devotion to it at that period,
"
--l--Aperit cum cornihus annum
Taurus,
'
When the bull with his horns opened the vernal year.' I observed that all nations
seem anciently to have vied with each other in celebrating that blissful epoch; and that
the moment the sun entered the sign Taurus, were displayed the signals of triumph and
the incentives to passion: that memorials of the universal festivity indulged at that
season are to be found in the records and customs of people otherwise the most opposite
in manners and most remote in situation. I could not avoid considering the circum-
stance as a strong additional proof; that mankind originally descended from one
great
family, and proceeded to the several regions in which they finally settled, from one
common and central spot; that the Apis or sacred bull of Egypt, was
only the symbol
of the sun in the vigour of vernal youth ; and that the bull of Japan, breaking with his
hom the mundane egg, was
evidently connected with the same bovine species of super-
stition, founded on the mixture of astronomy and mythology."'|'

festivals were changed to the first of April, and were celebrated on that day equally in
England and in India: in the former, every thing but the practice of making April fools
has ceased, but in the latter the festival is observed as well as the custom of making
April fools; that is, the custom of sending persons upon ridiculous and false errands to
create sport and merriment, one part of the rite: of the festival. In India this is called
the Huli festival. This vernal festival was celebrated on the day when the ancient
Persian year began, viz., when the sun entered into the sign of Aries; and Mr. Maurice
says,
"
The ancient Persian coins stamped with the head of the lam, which according to
D'Ancarville* were oifered to Genshid, the founder of Persepolis and first reformer of the
solar year amongst the Persians, are an additional demonstration of the high antiquity of
this festival."
When Sir Thomas Roe was ambassador at Delhi, this festival was celebrated by the
Mogul with astonishing magnihcence and splendour: it has the name of the Naurutz in
both India and Persia, and is celebrated in both alike.-|' And in the ambwdoi-'s travels
the writer acquaints us,
"
that some of their body being deputed to congratulate the Shah,
on the first day of the year, they found him at the pdace of Ispahan, sitting at a banquet,
and having near him the Minatzim or
astrologer, who rose up ever and anon, and taking
his astrolobe went to observe the sun; and at the very moment of the sun's reaching
the equator, he published aloud the new
year, the commencement of which was celebrated
by the Bring of great guns both from the castle and the city walls, and by the sound of
all kinds of instruments.";
The remains of the worship ofthe bull, or the sun in Taurus, are to be met with every
where-all over India, Persia, Greece, Italy, and Britain. They are discovered in the
neighbourhood of York and Aldborough, the ancient Isurium or Iseur, every day. In
the entrance to the library of the cathedral at York, is to be found part of the famous
tablet of the Mithraitic bull, which is so often repeated in the collections at Paris
Florence, Rome, and Naples.
But the finest of all the exemplars which I have seen of this most curious and
mysterious tablet just named, of Mithra killing the bull, is to be found in No. 12, in the
small round room going into our Tomnley collection at the British Museum. It is not
only curious-it is beautiiiil.
The description of a Mithraitic cave, which was found near Newcastle, may be seen
in the transactions of the Antiguarhm Society of that place. Some years ago something
of the kind was discovered at Oxford.
If I wished to swell the size of my book I could fill hundreds of pages with examples
of this Tauric worship. They may be found in the Rev. Mr. Maurice's Indian Antiqui-

number ot' examples of its prevalence in Syria may be found in Parkhurst's Hebrew
Lexicon, pp. 7-1--SO, 351, 4-Ol-4-03.
The change in the time of the equinoctial festival from the first of May to the first of
April, would, of course, be made at the time that the equinox had ceased to take place
in Taurus or May, or a little after. And according to the statement of the Rev. Mr.
Maurice, given above, the vernal equinox could not have coincided with the first degree
of Aries later, at the latest, than eighteen hundred years before Christ.
The thcts of these festivals being in honour of the vernal equinox, and of their taking
place with the singular rites of May-poles and April-fools, both in India and Britain,
cannot be disputed, and are proofs ofthe antiquity of the world more decisive than could
have been produced from any written documents whatever. The proofs of the same
thing from the astronomical tables and observations recorded of eclipses, &c., by the
Hindoos, have been attempted to be accounted for by the assertion, that they were
produced from hack-reckoning-but nothing of this kind can have taken place with
these festivals: and I apprehend that the fact of these festivals being established, tends,
in a
very considerable degree, to establish the astronomical tables and observations; as
there is in reality no conclusive evidence to prove that they were made, as it is alleged,
to gratify the vanity of the Bramins by back-reckoning. The assertion of the Christians
was made because the festivals were found to furnish a decisive argument against a
mistaken dogma of the divines respecting the object of the books of Moses-a dogma
taken up in an
age of ignorance and extreme credulity, by men whose overflowing zeal and
bigotry blinded them to the mischief they were
doing to their religion, and, with their
religion, to the cause of truth. For assuredly, nothing can be more unwise, considering
it merely as a
question of expediency, than to clog religion with appendages of this kind,
unnecessary either to doctrine or morals.
The attempt of Mr. Maurice to engraft the adoration of the bull, the golden ca{f§ and
the rites of the mayjpole into the Christian system is ingenious, but very bold. But he
was driven into this absurdity by the error of his brethren, in considering Moses as a
natural philosopher and a teacher of chronology-and thus endeavouring to make the
truth of his theological and moral doctrines depend upon the truth or connexion of a
number of chronological data, found in the treatises which he had taken into his system,
by way of what is technically called, in theology or
divinity, accommodation. I think
every thing tends to prove that these religious rites had their origin near Mount Irnaus;
or, as the Hindoo books say, near the Himmaleh mountains; and were probably pre-
served there, as it is recorded in Genesis, from the elfects of a
great catastrophe which
overwhelmed the rest of mankind. Although an unbeliever in the miracles of Moses
may dispute them, he cannot deny the probability of the fact as I have put it in a

The Rev. Mr. Faber* says,

that of the Canaanites, the Phrygians, the Greeks, and the Romans."
Again,

th made E. tian Thebes their capital; and that Cadmus, migrating thence into

Europe, built Boeotian Thebes, and called it after the name of his native town." Mr.
Faber then goes on to shew that the Phcnnicians, the Anakxm, the Philistim, the Palli,

translators of the Septuagint always render by the word Ethiopians, which, in fact, in
the Greek language means nothing but blacks, (but not necessarily negroes,) and as
such it might very properly be translated.
The Rev. Dr. Collyer1' says,
"

to have been made out, between Hinduism and the rites of the ancient Egyptians-

upon this, they set every engine at work to counteract the effects of the recorded
observations of the Hindoos, by representing, that they are in fact merely pretended
observations founded on
back-reckonings. Their great ally was Sir Wm. Jones-
unquestionably a most learned man. He was met upon this point by Professor Playfizir,
of Edinburgh, a man
equally learned, to say the least, in
astronomy. It has been said
that, before he died, he gave up his opinion ; I have endeavoured to ascertain the truth
of this assertion amongst his friends in Edinburgh, but I could not discover that any such
thing had taken place.
But if; when his faculties had become impaired by age and sickness, he did make any
concession to the clamours of the priests, this will never overthrow the decisive proofs
which he has given in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions) that "
the Bramins,
to have made the back-reckonings, must have been well acquainted with the most refined
of the theoretical improvements of modern astronomy. Instead of having forgot the
principles of their formulae, they must have been much more leamed than we know
they were, and, in fact, than their ancestors: indeed, more learned than our modem
astronomers were, until the astronomical theories of Newton were
completed very lately,
by the discoveries of some of the French philosophers.
The circumstances produced by Sir W. Jones to prove that the calculations of the
Hindoos are made retrospectively are so numerous, and of such a
complicated and
doubtful nature, that no man can be a
judge of them, except he be deeply skilled in
astronomy, not theoretical only, but practical also. Now, though a
person may easily
assert that either a record ofan
eclipse, or that of a. conjunction ofany of the planets, has
been founded on back-calculation made in modern times, few people will be persuaded
that back-calculation has produced the appointment of the festivals of the equinoxes and
solstic , on such days as shall have been totally inapplicable to those events, for about
6000 years ; that back-calculation also should have contrived to fix new festivals (after
the lapse of 2160 years had placed the May-day festivals wrongly) to the first of April;
that this should not have taken place in India only, where the origin of these festivals
has long since been forgotten, but also in Persia, where we are certain the Bramins have
had no
authority for several thousand years ; and in the British isles, to which they must
have come so
early as to be totally incompatible with the explanation of the system of
Mosaic chronology above alluded to. The fact of these May-day festivals is so well
known to every person who has been in India, and has paid attention to these subjects,
and comes so
completely home to every person's understanding, that it cannot be dis-
puted. The circumstances of the Tauric or equinoctial festivals, the alphabets, &c., tend
strongly to induce a belief, in defiance of the plausible reasoning of Sir W. Jones, that
the observations of the Bramins, Chinese, &c., are real and true observations, actually

taken at a time as far back as their Cain Yang, the last of their periods. All their
stories of anterior times are like the stories of Bacchus, Hercules, 8rc., of the Greeks,
and of all nations-idle nonsense. When festivals are found to have been actually
established many thousand years ago, and mountains cut into astronomical instruments,
which the manuscripts and traditions of the country say were made about the time when
the festivals were established, there seems no suiiicient reason to doubt, that the account
of the instruments and of the observations may be true.
Near the city of Benares, in India, are the astronomical instruments, cut out of the
solid rock of a mountain, which, in former times, were used for making the observations
just now alluded to, which Sir W. Jones and the priests say, were only back-reasonings.
The Bramins of the present day, it is said, do not know the use of them; they are of
great size, and tradition states them to be of the most remote antiquity. If the astrono-
mical facts stated in the works of the Bramins be the effects of back-reckoning, the
Bramins of the present day are as ignorant of the formulae on which they are
grounded,
as
they are of the nature of the astronomical instruments. If they have become acquainted
with them, it is by the instruction of Europeans.
A gentleman, in the Asiatic Researches, has lately, by means of the most deeply
lmrned and laborious calculations, discovered, that the history of Krishna, one of the
most celebrated Gods of the Hindoos, was invented in the year of Christ six hundred;
and that the story was laid about the beginning of the Christian aera. This goes directly
to overthrow all the I-Iindoo calculations. He has proved this as clear as the sun at
noon! He has absolutely demonstrated it! But it is unfortunate for this demonstration,
that the statue of this God is to be found in the very oldest caves and temples throughout
all India,-temples, the inscription on which are in a language used previously to the
Sanscrit, and now totally unknown to all mankind, any day to be seen amongst other
places, in the city of Seringham, and the Temple at Malvalipuram, or the city of the
great Bali*-the Syrian or Irish Baal.
It is asserted, that the Christians of St. Thomas were converted by the Apostle, in the
first century, and that this story of Krishna was invented to stop their increase. There
is no reason whatever fbr believing that they were ever much, if at all, more numerous
than they are at this time. And their numbers are so small that the idea of their being,
either from their increase or from their numbers, at any time formidable to the Bramins
of India, is ridiculous in the highest degree. It can only pass for a moment with
persons who have never considered the millions of the followers of Brama and Krishna,
who must be supposed to have the modern forgery of the year 600 palmed upon them,
and the immense extent of country over which they are spread. It seems rather remark-
able, that this antidote to the progress of Christianity should have been delayed 600
years.

THE QUESTION OF THE BRAMIN BACK-RECK0NING.1CH. V. SECT. IV. 157
If my reader think it worth the trouble, he may look to the Edinburgh Review, Vol.
XV p. 185, where he will find it satisfactorily proved on the authority of a
passage of
Arrian, that the worship of Krishna was practised in the time of Alexander the Great,
at what still remains one of the most famous temples of India, the Temple of Mathura
on the Jumna, the Mature Deorum* of Ptolemy. So much for this astronomical demon-
gn-ation.
It is discovered, accordingto this gentleman who writes in the Asiatic Researches, from
a certain relative location of the planets, that Krishna was born at a certain period. It
seems never to have occurred to him, that all these facts of the locations of the planets
are periodical. So that if he be right, that the time of the birth of Krishna can be
inferred from such a location and the circumstances attending it, (a thing in itself very
doubtfi1l,} all that he will prove will be this, that the pretended birth of this God must
have taken place at a similar part of a period, some time before the war of Alexander the
Great. And thus, ifwe know the length of the period or cycle referred to, we shall know
the latest time at which this God was
feigned to be born before the birth of Alexander.
And for this curious fact we shall certainly be very much obliged to him.
When our army of Indian Seapoys arrived at Thebes, in Egypt, in the course of the
French war, as was before observed, they discovered their favourite god Krishna, and
instantly fell to worshiping. (No doubt the cunning rogues of Bramins came to Egypt
in the year 600, and placed his statue amongst the ruins !) This I was told by several
oliicers soon a&er the event. Alluding to this well-known circumstance, Col. Fitz-
clarence has the following passage in his Travels :T
"
I made every attempt my time would permit to discover the celebrated figure which
caused the Hindoos, with the Indian contingent, to find fault with the natives of this
country for allowing a temple of Vishnou to fall to ruin, but did not succeed."
I could say Muon more on the subject of this temple at M¢n*lmra,jbr it is very curious,
but as it does not seem to concern my Druids further than I have stated, I much prefer
letting it alone ! ! !
The Rev. Mr. Maurice roundly asserts, that all the temples and caves of India were
made by Celtia. This I do not assert; but I quote it to shew how strongly the identity
between the remains of the Druids and those ofthe Bramms was
impressed on the mind
. . _ _

greatest care.

A PRACTICE OF THE GUEBRES OF INDIA.-CI-IAP. V. SECT. V.
The following is an example of the same kind as that just now
explained, and, like it,
cannot be disguised by the nonsensical plea of back-reckoning:
In Ireland it was the custom on the first of November, the Autumnal equinox when
the sun at the Vernal equinox was in Taurus, to extinguish all the fires except the
sacred fires of the Druids; and every one was prohibited, under the most terrible penal-
ties, from procuring this indispensible article in any way except from them, for which a
stipulated price was
paid.
Dr. Hyde states that this custom is continued by the fire worsbipers, or Guebres of
India at this day; and he observes that he learns from the Talmud, that this practice
was
adopted by the Israelites when they were in captivity in that country amongst the
Medes, who are called Persa:.'° What will the sceptics of the ancient connexion be-
tween Ireland and Asia say to this? Will they account for it by back-reckoning, or
say that it is an accident? If sceptics do, I can
only say that sceptics are more cre-
dulous than I am.
M. Baillie says,
"
After what we have said of the diihculty of the communications,
we cannot imagine that the Druids have quitted their forests two or three thousand years
ago to go to school with the Bramins or the Magi, or that the latter have visited our
ancestors. The probability is, that the world has been peopled or conquered by natives
of the North of Asia, who have extended themselves into all parts, East, West, and
South.'|' This is perfectly just; and it is the only mode by which the wonderful simi-
larity between the Druids and the Oriental nations can be satisfactorily accounted for.
ANTIQUITY OIQ THE FESTIVALS.-CRAP. V. SECT. VI.
According to the indisputable doctrine of Mr. Maurice, as delivered a little time ago,
that it was four thousand years before the birth of Christ since the sun rose in the first
degree of Taurus, it must now 'be 81 degrees, or about 5800 years since that event-
8l X '72 = 5889, very near our Orthodox date of the creation. This points to a period
for the building of Stonehenge or
Abury, which will astonish most persons who have
not been accustomed to examine subjects of this kind. But the works of such men as
Baillie, Playfair, Collyer, Faber, Maurice, Src., are beginning totake eH`ect, and to
enlighten the priesthood, as well as others, upon these subjects. The close connexion
between the monuments of the Druids, the 'Oriental cycles every where displayed in
them, asI shall presently shew, and the festivals, cannot be explained away; and our
priests must adopt the theory of Baillie, and sacrifice at the shrine of reason and ex-
perience the absurd dogmas of such men as Jerom, and the authors of the modern Chal-

The following is an extract from that great storehouse of learning, the Antiquities of

unbiassed opinion of this very learned man, all whose prejudices and interest run in a
contrary direction: this is the evidence of an unwilling witness. Nothing has oe.

the extravagant, though in some instances the authenticated, chronological details ofthe

Aa this question of the Well was
intersting on many accounts, the French sgavam, in Egypt, took much paim to
discover it, but in vain. By the cause which produced the gradual precesion of the eqtrinoxes and the solstice-s, this
well, probably, greatly to the surprise of the priests, would lose its use, and would no

Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that in three or fotn- thousand years itahould be illed up, buried, and

and found to be correct. Hence it become evident, on calculation backwards, that this well must have been dug so
early as
completely to overthrow our system of chronology. The latitude of Syeno is24° B', more than a whole
diameter of the sun to the northward ot' the Tropic of Cancer. Captain Corry, of the navy, found the latitude as
determined by M. Nouet, to be correct to a second.

perplexing. The factofthe existence ofthe well atsome time, I am satisiied, cannot be disputed, and the ditliculty

hardlyallowable. These circumstance have inducedmeto examinawithmrethesituaticn of the parties in than

Britain and India, which could not be understood by any but those possessing the key.
By this means a communication might have been continued till after the sun had ceased
to rise in Taurus at the vernal equinox, and had got into Aries. A common agreement
might have taken place between the priests of India and Britain, to
change the festival
and to establish the same rites for its observance as
exemplified in the Aprilrfbols, a
remnant yet remaining. If any one can better explain this I shall be obliged to him.
I am willing to learn and open to conviction. An attentive observation of the manners
of the priests of ancient nations' will shew, that, in general, a
priest, a dervise, a Druid, a
Bramin, would pass from India to Britain protected by his sacred character with perfect
ease. In Abaris we have a
striking example of this. The rod-the arrow of Apollo,
the magnetic needle, in one hand, and a branch of the Lotus-the sacred Lotus or the
misletoe, in the other, amongst the hospitable shepherd tribes, would every where com-
mand assistance and respect. At the time of which I speak, the world had become
divided into tribes, but probably the priests were one.
Mr. Maurice labours hard to prove, that a great nation of Cuthites or Cushites
overran Asia. By Cushites are always meant blacks or Etbiopians. Sir W. Jones was
also of this opinion, and thought the seat of their empire was Sidon. In the first part of
their opinion I quite agree with these gentlemen, but I think the situation of the capital
of their empire maybe doubtful. The influx of Scythiarts mentioned in Ezekiel and
he could not have ascertained the fact by actual inspection. 1-Ie must have been there on the very hottest day of
the year, and at the extreme point of the country, where the temples being destroyed, and the priests dead, he could
have little or no inducement to go. I think it is one of the things that an unsuspicious traveller was very likely to
take on
hearmy. It is probable that the priests then living, many years alter the destruction ofthe temple, may have
been unwilling to allow (if they knew it), that the story of the fact of the well rellecting the sun was not true, on
which probably their mlculations or festivak depended, and the cause of which probably they did not know; but if
they did understand the cause, they might not be willing to make it publicly known. It is almost certain that the
well was made for the purpose of fixing the exact moment of the aolstices, and of course ofthe eqninoctial points;
andatieraeertaintime they would find that some unknown mme, namely, the pneoessionofthe equinoxeabadput
all their fetivals out of order which depended upon them; that the vernal equinox no longer fell in Taurumbtrtwas
got into Aries. Their gmt dislike to innovation is known from the fact of their kings being compelled to NW,
that they would not alter the length of the year. Under these circumstance I thinkitvery likely that they
have given Herodotus wrong information. That previots to the time of the dau-action ofthe Temple by Carnbyses,

162 THE DRUID FESTIVAL OF CHRIS'1'MAS.1CHAP. V. SECT. VIII.
alluded to by Mr. 0'Connor, is of much more recent date. The empire alluded to by Sir
William Jones, I take to have been the empire ofthe Asiatic Ethiopian Memnon, the Negro,
whose colossal busts we have in the British Museum. These people were known probably
from ancient tradition to Homer, and by a
very allowable liberty he brings this Memnon,
though evidently of a date Far earlier than the Trojan war, to his seige of Troy. The
profound philosophers who take their history from epic poems, are of course obliged to
make two Memnons. And this in our Museum they call the younger. This irruption
of Negroes, of the countrymen of the flat-fhced, CURLY-BEADED Budda, from upper
India, were perhaps the first people who settled and inhabited Africa, built the pyramids,
and made the colossal bust of Memnon, &c., &c.
Some persons have derived the Greek word Ethiop, from au6m and mp. This Mr.
Bryant does not approve, saying) that Ai0aol/ is a title of Zeus. This is true; he was
called the black God, Am; sends-rov Asdml/. Lycophron styles him Aauimuv I`Ipmp.a.6|ug
Aadaovlz, which I translate, Prometheus the Black Demon.
This is again a subject replete with very curious matter, but as it does not concern
my Druids, I shall not meddle with it. Some future day, perhaps, I may discuss
it at large.
THE DRUID FESTIVAL OF CHR.ISTMAS.*'CHAP. V. SECT. VIII.
The festival of the twenty-fifth of December was celebrated by the Druids in Bri-
tain and Ireland with great fires lighted on the tops of the hills. This festival was
repeated on the twelhh day, or on what we call the Epiphany. In some parts, the fires
are still continued. We have not now remaining any documents to inform us what
amongst the British Druids was the object or name of this festival, but perhaps we
may
gather it from circumstances.
The order of Druids, I scarcely need observe, was as common in France as in
the British isles. Christmas in France is called Noel; this word is, in fact, the
Hebrew or Chaldee word H1713 nule. But if this bein the Chaldee dialect, the last
letter may be emphatic, as it is in the word H350 mic-e, the king.1' In this case, it
may mean the parturition; or, it may be simply the verb pariri, to bring forth. In
Irish, Christmas Day is called Nolagh.¢
The name of Christmas Day in Cornish is Nadelig; in Armorican, Nadelek; in
the Gael, Nollig.§ -
'
The evergreens, and particularly the misletoe, which are used all over the country. and
even in London, in this festival, betray its Druidical origin. These had evidently
nothing to do with Christianity.

Amongst the Gauls, more than a hundred years before the Christian ara, in the district
of Chartres, a festival was celebrated to the honour of the Virgin-Virgini parituraa.'
In the year 1747, a Mithraic monument was found at Oxford, on which is exhibited
a female nursing an infant-the Goddess of the _year nursing the God day. Stukeley
has made a dissertation on this monument, which he shews to be a memorial gf the birth
of Mithra in the night of lightnf

This was a
great festival with the Persians, who, in very early times, celebrated the
birth of their God-Mithra.
It was the custom of the Heat ens, ong ,
birth-days of their Gods. This was the example which the Christians, I think not very

Amonvst these ancient festivals, Christmas Day is perhaps the most curious. The
assertionaherc made that this is nothing more than a remnant of the worship of the
Druids, at first will startle the imagination of many persons; but whether the reader be
a follower of the Roman church, or a Protestant, if his understanding be not completely
blinded by superstition, he will instantly see that the appointment, by the rulers of the
church, of a
day for any particular ceremony, whether they acted from a true or a mistaken
reason in selecting the day, cannot seriously aH`ect the question of the truth of Christi-
anity. It is a well-known litct, which the antiquarian divines of the Protestant or the

and even civil wars took place respectingthem, before they were determined. The monks
of the Roman and Greek Church were in those times the principal actors in these
matters; they were few of them in orders, they were the remnants of the sect of the Essenes
converted to Christianity, and much degraded and corrupted from their excellent prede-
cessors in the time of Philo. It is not necessary to enter into this question here, but it
may be shewn that there is no little probability, besides the tradition of the church, that
the inscription noticed before upon the pedestal of the colossal statue of Elias, under the
cupola of St. Peter at Rome, is true-Elias Fundator Ordinis Carmelitamm.
From Elias came the Essenes, and from the Essenes the Carmelite monks, who were
in fact Christian Essenes. These people, in the early and middle ages of the church,
retained very little ofthe character given them by Philo and Josephus ; they had sunk with
the prevailing degradation of the human species. If they had not done so, human nature
would not have become degraded ; their exception alone would have prevented it. These
Essenes in Egypt, Persia, and other places, had probably given into the prevailing ado-
ration of the heavenly bodies, previously to the time of Philo; and when they became
converts to Christianity, they formed an odd mixture of the two religions. Their first
religion, in its origin and history, was forgotten, and their new one not learned. They
were probably zealous devotees, but as ignorant as the lowest ofthe hermits and mendi-
cant orders of the present Italians. The grade in society of many of these people, no
educated member of the Roman communion requires teaching.
ORIGIN OF THE WORD LOBD._~CHAP. V. SECT. IX.
These people found the head of their religion called Lord. This was
enough for them ;
every thing which related to this Lord they seized on, and by means of their ill-under-
stood and abused tradition, spliced it into their religion. These Ccnobites, as Philo
calls them, found that in what they called their monasteries, many of them built before
the Christian =.era,* a
day had fiom time immemorial been dedicated to the God Sol, as
his birth-day, and that he bore the epithet Lord.1' This Lord they thought could be no
other than their Lord and God: the mistakewas easily made and very naturally adopted,
And the rites of this Lord became, alter long and bloody feuds between diderent bodies
Of these persons, spliced into and amalgarnated with Christianity. Thus came the
25th of December, the Heathen festival of the God Sol, to be selected as the birth-day ot'
Christ, and the Druidical festival of the winter Solstice to become a Christian rite. No
learned divine will maintain, that there is any more reason to believe the 95th of Decem-
ber to have been the birth-day, than the 25th of January. Nor is it in any way necessary
to the truth of Christianity that it should be known. If it be thought right to keep a
day,
the church has a
right to ix what day it pleases.

The mention of the word Lord leads to a consideration of the meaning of it. The exact
origin or
etymology of it is no where to be found. When the government of Alexandria,
or the Jews in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, about 250 years before the birth of
Christ, caused a translation of the Pentateuch, now included in our
Septuagint, to be made
from the Hebrew language into the Greek, a
difhculty was found with the word Jehovah.
When the third commandment is properly translated, it does not refer to our wicked and
odious habit of profane swearing, but it is a law like that for the observance of the sab-
bath, only applicable to the Israelitish nation. The words ought to be, Thou shalt not
take the name
of Jehovah thy God nr vars, or IRHEVERENTLY. In consequence of
this law, the Jews never either wrote or spoke the name of Jehovah, except on the most
solemn occasions; and they carried their scruples so far as
actually to continue the
name upon the golden plate on the forehead of the high priest in the ancient letter of the
Samaritans, in which the Pentateuch was written before the time of Ezra, and by whom
the Pentateuch was translated into the Chaldee: and in the time of Jerom he testifies
that Bibles were commonly met with, having the name of Jehovah in this old letter.'
In consequence of these religious scruples the translators, (who from the circumstance
were
evidently Jews,) in order to avoid the sinful repetition of the word Jehovah, had
recourse to the adoption of a term of the Heathens, which was
applied by them as an
epithet of honour to the greatest of their gods, as well as to the sun, or god Sol, in Greek
Kugmg, in Latin Dominus, and in ancient Celtic Adon, in Hebrew 5218 Adni. It was
used by the ancients precisely as we use it, both as a term for God, and also as a title of
honour. These are the reasons which probably caused the festival of the god Sol to be
adopted by the Christians. Many other festivals and rites may be pointed out, which
have their origin in the same cause-many taken from the Romans and Greeks, who
had previously received most of them from the Druids or
Hyperboreans.1°
On the twenty-fifth of December, at the first moment of the day throughout all the
ancient world, the birth-day of the god Sol was celebrated. This was the moment when,
after the supposed winter solstice, and the lowest point of his degradation below our
hemisphere, he began to increase, and gradually to ascend. At this moment, in all the
ancient religions, his birth was kept: from India to the ultima Thule, these ceremonies
partook of the same character: every where the God was
feigned to be born, and his
festival was celebrated with great rejoicings. In these observations I beg it may be

GODS OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS.-CHAP. V. SECT. X.
1 shall now enter rather largely into a detail of the ancient Deities of the British
islands, but more particularly of those of Ireland. And I flatter myself I shall shew
their identity with those of the ancient Syrians and Greeks, in a manner which will leave
no room for any doubt.
Dionysius Periegites* states, that the rites of Bacchus were celebrated in the British
isles. He lived in the time of Augustus Cmsar. Strabof says, that there was an island
near to (Bge-rawia.) Britain, where Ceres and Prosperpine were worshiped with the same
rites as in Samothrace. Straho lived in the time of Augustus and Tiberius, and he
drew his infomation from Artemidorus, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Lathyrus,
about one hundred years before Christ. The worship of the Cabiri was supposed to
have come
originally from Phoenicia.; Sammes has proved, that when Artemodorus
lived, none of the Greeks had been in Britain.§
Ireland was in ancient times called Insula sac:-a.|| An epithet also given to the isle of
Samothraceil Mr. Vallencey has well observed, that the name of Sacred could not have
been given to Ireland on account of its Christianity, because the author Festus Avienus,
who relates this, lived in the fourth century before St. Patrick arrived in Ireland (if he
ever did arrive). He also observes, that the same name was
given by the Gaels to
Ireland." This seems to give countenance to the assertion of Mr. Wilsford,'|'1' that the
British isles were called the sacred isles of the west, and one of them Hiranya, in the

SYSTEM OF M. PICTET, OF GENEVA.*CHAP. V. SECT. XI.
It is well known that the religious rites of Samothrace were those of the Cabiri,
ot' Ceres and Proserpine, and that they were the most revered of' any in Greece. A
learned friend ofthe author's, M. Pictet, of Geneva, has endeavoured to shew that there
was amost intimate relation and striking similiarity between the gods of Ireland and
those of Somothrace and Phcnnicia; and, in short, that the Cabiri were
worshiped in
Ireland. He has also endeavoured to explain from the ancient Irish records and tradi-
tions, the nature of the Cabiric worship. Whatever may be thought of the species
ot' regular order which he thinks prevailed, no person will deny that he has displayed
both ingenuity and learning! He maintains that the Druidical system of the Irish
divinities ascended from the lowest to the highest, by a
regular gradation of Gods and
Goddesses, till it reached the first great Cause-that they formed a
species of chain, by
which they were all connected together.

AESAR. INTELLECTUAL FIRE 011 LOGH.-CHAP. V. SECT. XII.
The first, beginning at the bottom of the series, is Aesar.' He is called God; or 'mire
intelligent, Dia or Logh: Mr. Vallencey says, the word Logh means the spiritual flame,
and identifies itself with the Anya; of the Greeks. In a vast number of languages the
word Logh, standing for some idea relating to lire, is to be found. The word Aesar, in
Irish, literally means to kindle a fire. In Chaldean, Rm aza, to illuminate, mpg asa,
fire. Sanscrit Osch,1' fire or heat. By many of the ancient philosophers fire was
considered as the primitive element, and it is unnecessary to say any thing of the fire of
the Magi, or of the numerous examples of the appearance of God as a fire to Moses, the
sacred fire of the Israelites, &c.
Mr. Selden says,
"
Although you may truly say with Origen that, before our Saviour's
time, Britain acknowledged not one true God, yet it came as near to what they should
have done, or rather nearer than most of others, either Greek or Roman, as
by notions
in Caesar, Strabo, Lucan, and the like discoursing of them, you may be satisfied. For
although Apollo, Mars, Mercury, were
worshiped among the vulgar Gauls, yet it
appears that the Druids' invocation was to one
all-healing or all-saving Power." 1'
As tire was
supposed to be the first principle of all things, it was also supposed, by a
peculiar refinement, to be the destroyer, whence, probably, first arose the idea of the
Creator and the Destroyer being identified. The primitive fire wa
supposed to have an
insatiable appetite for devouring all things. According to Maximus Tyrius, the ancient
Persians threw into the iire combustible matters, crying, Devour, 0 Lord .'§ It is
remarkable, that in Irish, easam or asam
signifies to make or create. Aesar, then, would
be the creator. Aesar was also connected with the power of magic, and he was called a
magician. The word 108 asr, in Hebrew, has the meaning of ligavit, obligavit, with
the signiiication of incantare. According to Schelling,|| the Eastem words which have
the signification of binding, have generally the signiiication of incantation. He at-
tempts to explain the meaning of the word Osiris by W8 'IDN asr, air, 1[ incantator ignis_
He founds this interpretation on the Samaritan text of the l8tl1 chapter and llth verse
of Deuteronomy, which renders 'mn 'Inn hbr, lzbr, ligans, ligationem, by 'IDX 193
asr, asf, which puts out of doubt the signilication of magic. Aesar, considered as the

source of movement, was, at the same time, the author of duality or opposition, and of
discord, whence in Irish comes the word asard, dispute, and asardoir, a
quarrelsome
person. Some have thought that this was the Hesus or Esus, the god of war ot' the
Gauls; but with more probability he has been taken to be the Aesar of the Etruscans,
which Suetonius says* in the Etruscan language was the name of God. The Aeszwar
or Iswara, of the Indians, fumishes some interesting analogies. It is said, in the Baga-
vat-Gita,
"
Aesavar resides in every mortal being, and puts in movement, by his super-
natural powers, all things which mount on the wheel of time." Aesmar is considered as
the first mover, a
signilication well enough agreeing with the attribute of the Irish Aesar.
And the name of Isa or Israara signifies Lord or Master, and also the creative power.
This power was given by the different sects of religions, to Brahma, Vistnou, and to
Sivi.
It ihay be observed, en passant, that except when God is said to have appeared to the
h h haracter, he always assumed the appearance of Ere.
ancient patriarchs in t e uman c
And all the early Fathers of the Church considered him, from these circumstances, to
consist of a certain refined or ethereal fire or spiritual fire.
Aesar is represented symbolically as the creator by the act of lighting fire, that is,
putting in play the primitive movement for the creation of beings. Thus the first month
was called after him. The month of March, with the Romans, was
originally called the
first month. With the Chaldeans March was called Adar; with the Syrians, Odar,
which, in their mode of speaking, was pronounced Azura;
The Gauls had a god called Hesus; was this from the Greek word tjww, or the Hebrew
word yay* iso, or both? In the Hebrew, if the H e, were the emphatic article, then the
word would be literally The preserver. Hesus was also often the destroyer: in Gaul,
Mars. Iswara was also in India the destroyer, delighted with human sacrifices.
THE MOTHER OF THE GODS.--CRAP. V. SECT, XIII.
The mother of the gods comes next in succession, and bore a great number of names.
She was called Eire, Eirin, Eirean, Eirinn, Ann, Nam, Anon, Nannan, Ith, Ia!/1, A1u?lt,
Eadna, Eoghna, Aonaclz, Tlacbgo, Tlaclat, Illomo, .Mumham, Ama, Ops, and Sibllol.
The idea of the Greek mother` of the gods applies to all these names, the passivefe-
minine principle, the earth, water, darkness. In an ancient Irish glossary Anu,Nanu,
Nanam, are said to be the same as the mother of the gods. In Irish Mom, Mailman,
Mamman, Nang, and Ama, all signify mother. The term may be traced in many lan~
guages, as mg mn, in Hebrew. From this comes the Latin amo, to love or desire.

170 THE MOTHER OF THE GODS.-CRAP. V. SECT. XIII.
The word Eire, Eirin, signifies both night, obscurity, and desire, and to be hungry.
From this comes
probably the Greek E¢aBn;, Erebus, and cgspvog, obscure, black, terrible.
The words Itk and Iath, names which convey the idea of hunger, come from the Irish
word itham-are constantly joined to the word Derc, and form the word Derc-ith, the
poor ith. This is the goddess Derceto of the Phcenicians, and was
worshiped at Joppa
and Ascalon. She is the same as
Atergatis, Astarte, or Astoreth, and has the same
attributes.
All the goddesses of Syria and Egypt had the same prevailing attribute of appetence,
or desire for fecundity. This was the case with Isis, Ceres-Evynnis, or Demeter Equ-
nis ; the last evidently from the Irish or Celtic Eirinn. From this comes also the Greek
Egwwg, the fury, and the Epwg, desire, love. Asterotlz was the moon. This was also
the case with Ire, Axire, and is the same as the Azieros of Samothrace.
The Ops is the Opis of Thrace, surnarned Hyberborean, worshiped as the Great
Mother. Her name is found in the cave at New Grange.
The goddess Am: seems to have been considered as the tutelar goddess of Ireland. It
is olten called the Isle of Nannu, whence perhaps it may have got the name gf sac;-ed
island. Several places are called after her, as
Nany-water. One of the days of the
week was called after this goddess, Nong-dae, dies Veneris,' and she was said to be the
mother of the Feini, that is of the Paani, or Puni, or P/lamicians, who are said first to
have colonised Ireland.
In Aesar and Eire, or Axire, may be found the duality of all the ancient systems;
the good and bad principles. The same identity may be found in Ceres and Per-
sep/lone, who were adored at Eleusis as one divinity. Euripidesf calls Ceres and
Proserpine Samvopm Gm. In Egypt the same identity is found in AI/lor, Isis, and
Neith. This apparent contradiction is accounted for by the doctrine that there was
no such thing as destruction; that destruction was only a new creation, a new for-
mation of indestructible matter-that thus the destroyer was the creator. The same
doctrine is found in the Oromasdes, and Arhnan of the Persians, and the Brama and
Seeva of India.
In the philosophy of the Bramins, the Vedas say, that Brahm reposed eternally in
himselfi This is the Hebrew moving on the face ot' the waters. The Hebrew properly
translated ought to be rendered broodedl not moved. The spirit of God brooded. The
Hebrew word nannp mrhpt, does not mean to move, but correctly to brood, as a hen
on her eggs, before she brings out her young. The Hindoo, Sir W. Jones supposes, to
be copied from the Mosaic history. They are
evidently the same idea. Whilst Bralzm
was thus disposed ot] he was said to be surrounded with Maya, that is, the desire to
produce, eternal love, or illusion. Maya is, according to the learned Hindoos, the first
-
vw.. came. vol. rv. p. 225. f rim. ess.
MOLLOCH.-CHAP. V. SECT. XIV. 171
tendency ofthe Divinity to diversity itself in creating worlds. She is regarded as the
Mother of Nature, and of the inferior gods: but Sir W. Jones continues, "
The word
Nlaya, or illusion, has another sense more abstracted in the philosophy of the Pirdantas,
where it signgfes the system ofperceptions which divine ommpotence makes to beprodnced
in the understandings ofhis creatures, but which has no
reality independent ofthe mind."'
The Persephone of the Greeks was also called Maia, and was the same as the Maya of
India, and the Artemis and the Hyperborean Ih/thia. To these the idea of magic was
always attached.
The E0-Amt is the IVIaio of Ireland. She is often surnamed Bidhgoe, a name which
literally means female, or woman of illusion, or of lying, (prmstigiatrix,) in the same
senseas Jllaia and Persephone. Bithe means female, and go deception. This is pro-
bably the Biducht of the Persians, who was their Venus.
Eo-Ana is the second Ith, and is opposed to Ain or Aion, which again leads to the
idea of Magic, (Ainin or Oinin is to kill by sorcery,) and also that of real fire, not the
intellectual, but real, tangible fire kindled by Aesar. This is proved by its being called
Mole, lllulac, Mollac, or Molloch, a word which in Irish means fire. Ain, or Aion, is
also called O1m,'|' which means the solar heat. In one of the versions of the Old Tes-
tament, the city of Egypt and the temple, there called the city of Heliopolis, or of the
sun, is called the city and temple of On. In another version it is called the city of
destruction. This has been thought to be an intentional corruption; but it might arise
from the character of On, or Ain, or Aion, in his capacity of destroyer, which will be
presently explained.
1'!0LLOCH»*CI-IAP. V. SECT. XIV.
The Mole, or Mollac, or Molloch of Ireland, was the Moloch of the Ammonites, which
was the sun zi in Hebrew 'hp mllc. The word HSD mlh in Hebrew, means to burn
or consume. In Irish the word Miollach means to devour or consume. An old
Irish commentator says,
"
Ain treidhe Dia aimn Taulac, Fan, Mollac ;" that is to sayv
"
Ain, triple God, of name Taulac, Fan, Mollac." This is probably the Brama, Vistnu,
and Seeva of India, and the Oromasdes, Mithra, and Arimanius of Persia, the Creator,
the Preserver, and the Destroyer.
Here we see that the name Ain, or On, the name of the city of destruction, or of
Heliopolis, or the Sun, is declared to be, in the Irish language, the name of a God or
triad of Gods, similar to the famous triad ofthe ancients, the Creator, the Preserver, and
'
h b t h
the Destroyer. All etymologists have supposed the word On to mean t c sun, u ow

the name arose has not before been explained. When the ancients say the city of On
was called Heliopolis, they say it was called the city of the Sun-'Emu fromg. Respect-
ing the word On, as well as many other little-understood words of the ancients, Sir W.
Drummond's essay on a Punic inscription may be consulted.
In Fan is found the P/lanes or .Erilcapeus of the Orphic hymns, called Protogonos and
Pan. Jablonski says that the Orphic Plzanes is derived from the Coptic word Phene/'z,*
which means eiema1.1' This is synonymous with the Greek word arm etemitas.
The Ain or Phan of Ireland, was
Protogonos, first-born, begotten by the first breath or
spirit Aesar, and night, Amare. The breath or first spirit named by Eusebius, and called
Kami-za, is the Hebrew nag-ghn liqzfvih, imwvatus est faeillam. The signification then
would be the same as that of Aesar, to kindle fire. From the words Phones and Fan,
come the Greek words cpmvm, to make manifest, and epavog, visible.
CEARAS AND CEARA, OR CERES.-CI-IAP. V. SECT. XV.
The third in the ascending chain of Deities are Cearas and Ceara. An old commen-
tator says,
"
Cearas ainm don dagh," that is, Cearas name of fire. Cearas was the same
as
Daghdae, or Dogdha, which also meant fire, or the god of fire. In the book of Bal{y-
mote, Daghdae, who is identified with Cearas, is called Credne Ceard. This may be
explained by the expression Crea!-me Ceard, that is to say, Cear¢L the man
q/` science.
In Irish, the word ceard means smith, or mechanic-a giver of forms; whence comes
the word Kar or
Keri to form or make, similar to the Sanscrit, Karoti facit, Karta factor;
the Persian Kerdeu facere, Ke;-de/1, factus; the Latin cereo and creo to make; also the
Hebrew WTI lrrs, artifex, fabricavit. The idea of magician, as usual, is found here.§
This Cearas was the Axiolcersos of Samothrace, not only in idea, but in language, for the
latter was called also A.zceara.s~.|| Schelling, in analysing the names of the Cabiri, Airfo-
lrersa and Axiokersos, shews that Kersa and Ke:-sos are but another form of the name of
Cérés or Kérés. According to Schelling, the primitive form of Kersos was Kersor, the
Xpua-mp of Sanchoniathon.1]' This was the same as Hephastos, and endowed with magical
powers. Bochart"* has reproduced this name into the Phoenician 'l'IRt!f|f1 /rrsaur,
which may be rendered incantator ignis. In Irish,1'1' Cearas-ur or Cearas-uir has the
same
meaning.
The learned etymological researches of Schelling, have shewn the intimate relation
between the Cabiric Axiokersos, the Phcenician Chrysor, the Phtas and Osiris of Egypt,

and the Dionysius of the Greeks. The Axearas of Ireland ranks with the same
mythological personages, and has the same
signilication. According to Schelling,
Osiris is the Hebrew WWQWUR asrais, of which the signiiication is the same as Hrsaur.
Cearas is identified with Dagh-dae, who is called Crom-eoc/uz,_the good Cram, and
Rad or Ruud strong, powerful. Daghdae-Cearas has four daughters, Brid or Brit,
Goddess of poetry, and Ceac/it, Goddess of medicine, and for brother, Og/ima, inventor
of the alphabet, and for children, Mitlzr or Mdr, the rays of the sun."
The wife of Cearas, Ceara, was the Goddess of nature, or nature in its maturity. The
cultivation of corn and the instruments of agriculture are said to have been invented by
her. She presided over the fruits of the earth. She is evidently the Ceres of the
ancients. If any thing was
wanting to complete the proof; it would be found in the
fact, that she had a
daughter called Porsaibhean,1' the Perseplaone of the Greeks, and the
Proserpine of the Romans.
According to
Schelling, Ceres is the Hebrew win Izrs or clzrs, and Kersa the Chal-
dean M/111 hrsa or chrsa, from VIH hrs or c/lrs, aravit and sata. The meaning of this
name was
praestigiatrix, mago, or iiabricatrixdg
The Maya of India was the same as the Maia of the Greeks, but she was the same as
Persephone,§ and Persephone was Ceres, and Ceres was the mother of the Gods and
the queen of heaven.
NATH.-CRAP. Y. SECT. XVI.
The other Deities of the series do not oH`er any very striking etymological analogies,
till we come to the last Nath, the Goddess of Wisdom, and Naith, the God in opposi-
tion to her. Nath is the Gaelic word for science in general. This is evidently the
Neith of the Egyptians. In Irish, Neith means battle or combat. This is the Neton
of the Spaniards. Macrobiusll says,
"
Accitani, hispana gens, simulacrum Martis
maxima religione celebrant, Netan vocantes."
It is not necessary to enlarge fiirther on the chain of Deities endeavoured to be esta-
blished by Messrs. Vallencey and Pictét. However imaginary persons may think this
chain, they must admit the identity of the ancient and the Irish deities: it seems im-
possible that this should be denied. We now come to one of the Gods of Ireland,
the most curious of all.

SAMBA!! OR BAL-SAB.'_CHAP. V. SECT. XVII.
The God Samhan is placed by M. Pictet at the head of his double series, with the
following explanation: Samhan eadhou CeisiL ead/lon Giolla; Sam/lan, that is to say
the evil spirit, (Satan,) that is to say, the Sersiteun'
Samhan appears to have been one of the Gods, the most revered, in Ireland. An
annual solemnity was instituted to his honour, which is yet celebrated on the evening of
the first day of November; which yet at this day is called the Oid/:che Sam/ina,-[' or the
night of Sam/cami'
This solemnity was consecrated by the Druids, to the intercession of the living for the
souls of those who had died the year preceding, or in the current year. For, according
to their doctrine, Samlnm called before him these souls, and passed them to the mansions
of the blessed, or returned them to a re-existence here, as a
punishment for their crimes.
He was also called Bal-Sab or Lord of Death. It was
probably this epithet which
induced the commentator to call Samhan by the name of CeisiL which, in modern Irish,
means devil.
Samhan was also the Sun, or rather the image of the sun. This word is found in
many Semitic languages: in Arabic, Schams, the sun; Hebrew, WDW sms; Chaldean,
Rwrgw, smsa ; Syrian, Sclzemsc/so ; in Pehlvi, Schemsrh; in Sanscrit, Hamsa, the sun.§
The Sun was the first object of the worship of all the Heathens, either as Creator, or as
an emblem or Shekinah of the Divinity. These attributes of Samhan seem at first con-
tradictory, but they are not unusual amongst the Heathen Gods. With the Greeks,
Dionysos, the good Demiurge, is identified with Hades. In Egypt, Osiris was the Lord
of death; with the Scandinavians, Odin, the God beneiicent, was, at the same time,
king of the infernal regions. This deity was above all the others whom we have named,
but he was below the supreme being Baal. If Samhan were the Sun, as we see he was,
he answers to Mithra of the Persians, who was the middle link between Oromasdes and
Arimanius-between the Creator and the Destroyer, and was called the preserver.
Schelling says, the Irish doctrine was, that the souls did not descend to the severe
Zeus, (Pluto, the Jupiter of the Styx,) but that they ascended to the merciihl Osiris.
Such is the meaning of the Irish Samhan, who is a merciful judge, not deciding by his

caprice, but holding his power from the God Supreme, of whom he is the image! In
all this is a curious mixture of physical and moral doctrines.
Samhan seems to have been the same with the Kadmillos of Samothrace, and Camillus
ofthe Etruscans. They were inferior to the great God, but superior to the other Cabiri.
They Were the heralds of the great God, '78'*D'lP lcdmial, prior, antecedens.
The whole system is called Smnlum-draoic, that is to say, the magic of Samhan.
Draoic signifies magic; Draoith, a
magician. In the Irish glossaries Seanoir, which
signifies an old magician, 8
9886, is always applied to the Druids. In the Gaelic trans-
lation of the Bible, the three magi who came to the birth of Cnnzsr are called Draoitlze.
In Welsh, the Druids are called Derzayzon, in the singular Dlsnwvz; evidently the
Eastern Der-vice. The word dry, clearly taken from the Gaelic, signifies a
magician.
In Persian, a wise man, or
Magus is also called Dam.
In an old Irish glossary it is said, Samhandraoic, Eadlum Cabur-the magic of Sam-
han; that is to say, Canon. And it adds this explanation, Ead/lon comkceangalladlz;
that is, an association, a mutual confederation.
ESMUN.1CHAP. V. SECT. XVIII.
The learned have been in much diiiiculty to account for the two words Esmun and
Saman. These words have some analogies of name and meaning, which, though very
obscure, ought not to be passed in silence. Both terminate the chain of the Cabiri;
both are Gods of death; and yet Esmun is, as well as Samoa, the sun, the source of the
celestial heat and life. The ancients vary much in the number of the gods called Cabiri.
As M. Pictet justly observes, these changes have probably arisen in them from their not
being understood, in passing from Phcenicia and Egypt into Thrace, Greece, and the
Western parts of the world, by the devotees who were not initiated in their secret mys-
teries. It must be evident to any person who looks closely into this subject, that in a
very early period the meaning of the mysteries and mythological system was lost; and
was
probably as little, or even less, understood than it is at this day. The treatises by
the ancients which remain to us
suiiiciently prove this. To several causes the ignorance
of the world may be attributed. The first great cause is to be found in the practice
adopted by the priests of preserving their learning by tradition. Learning of this kind,
thus preserved, must have necessarily been subject to constant changes. Books have not
been able to preserve any religion from change; then how can it be expected that a reli-
gious system should be preserved by memory in the same state for thousands of years
without change; or, indeed, that it should be preserved at all ? From this natural cause
the meaning of the ancient religious mysteries became doubttiil even to the initiated.

176 EXPLANATION OF SOME ANCIENT DOCTRINES.=CHAP. Y. SECT. XIX.
The mysteries of Egypt were probably lost at the time when Cambyses, who, in sub-
stance, professed the religion of the Israelites, with an iconoclastic tiny, which would have
done honour to John Knox, overthrew the temples, and murdered the priests, wherever
he could lay hands on them. From these causes, the number and attributes of the
Cabiri have been doubttiil for many centuries. Authors have described them as con-
sisting of different numbers, and as
possessed of diferent qualities. Thus some said
they were three in number, some seven, some
eight, and others twelve. Thus again
they were
supposed to possess attributes, or qualities, or powers, in direct opposition to
one another. Thus in the case of Esmun and Samara, they are both beneficent Gods,
and Gods of the infernal regions. Thus Oromasdes partook of the evil nature of Arima-
nius, and Arimanius of the good qualities of Oromasdes. A few observations will now
be made upon both these subjects, which may be followed up at some tiitureda ymore
at length.
EXPLANATION OF SOME ANCIENT D0C'1'R.INES.1CHAP. V. SECT. XIX.
It was an universal principle with all the ancient philosophers, that from nothing,
nothing could be made: .Ex nillilo niililjft. From this principle they inferred, correctly
enough, perhaps, if the principle be admitted, that there could be no such thing as de-
struction; that destruction, in the popular sense of the word, was
only reproduction,
or a
change in the form or the mode of the existence of matter. If the persons who
translated the famous Septuagint into Greek are
right in their translation, and it is very
diiiicult to believe that these authorized persons could be ignorant of the Hebrew lan-
guage, Moses gave no opinion upon this subject one way or the other.
In looking around them, unfortunately, they found no
dilliculty in making the dis-
covery that evil existed; but to account for this evil, without compromising the ex.
istence of a God, was to them a diiiicult matter. To surmount this diiculty, schemes
innumerable were formed, are forming, and will probably continue to be formed by
ingenious persons till the end of time. It presents a
dimculty, perhaps by the human
mind alone, never to be surmounted. In consequence of these investigations, arose the
doctrine of two opposite and conflicting powers, one the author of good, the other, in
opposition to him, the author of evil; and from these, in process of time, arose a téiri
the preserver, or mediator-Brama, Vistnu, and Seeva; Oromasdes, Mithra, and Ari-
manius. These doctrines became disseminated over the world fiom China and India,
even to the utmost bounds of Britain. They were the undisputed creed of the whole
earth; even, as
might easily be proved, of the ancestors of the amiable, unfortunate,
and interesting Montezuma, of Mexico.

THE FIRST CABIRI THREE IN NUMBER.-CHAP. V. SECT. XX.
These powers constituted the first canmr Innes IN NUMBER. From the non-
destructibility of matter, it followed, that the apparent destroyer was
only a creator or
factor, in the sense ot` the Septuagint nronqa-av, fecit; and the more the magicians or
almagests examined, the more they would be confirmed in opinion, that matter cannot
cease to exist-be annihilated. The wax
taper is burnt; but the men who could form
the Cycle of the Neros, reduce gold into powder, and visit the Perus for the precious
metals, knew well enough that when burnt it had not ceased to exist-only a new cea-
tion had taken place. Many persons, struck with the similarity between the Heathen
and the Christian Trinity, have supposed that some information respecting it rnust have
been imparted to the early inhabitants of the world, which in process of time became
forgotten or
corrupted. This is very curious, but its discussion would lead too far fi-om
the immediate subject before us. The ancients imagined that their triad of gods or
persons, only constituted one God; that they formed, as it were, a circle; that the
Creator was the destroyer, the Destroyer the creator. A due consideration of this, and
its proper application, will enable the inquirer, with the greatest possible ease, to ac,
count for almost innumerable apparent contradictions, which otherwise seem
absolutely
unaccountable. The reader must often have observed diiiiculties in the preceding pages,
which the knowledge of this system will easily obviate. Had M. Pieter paid sufficient
attention to it, he would have removed some obstacles to his theory, with which it is no
ways inconsistent. It seems rather surprising that he should not have said more about
it, as it is an
integral part of the Druidical system, as is observed by himself] (as noticed in
Sect xv.,) where he repeats the words of an old Irish commentator, who says,
"
Ain
treidhe Dia ainm Taulac, Fan, Molloch ;" that is to say,
"
Ain, trhnle God, qf name
Taulac, Fan, 2l'Iol1ac."
These three being the original Cabiri, we are
naturally led to an
inquiry into the
meaning of the word.
MEANING OF THE WORD CABIRI.-CHAI-'. V. SECT. XXI.
From the language used respecting the Cabiri, by Strabo, Julius Firmicus, and others,
it is perfectly clear that the ancients were
entirely ignorant of the meaning of the term
Cabiri. This arose from the supreme contempt in which they held all languages but
the Greek, which prevented them from looking to the Phmnician, where they would
have instantly found it.'

ITS MEANING OF THE WORD CABIRI.-CHAP. V. SECT. XXI.
The etymology of this word has been much disputed. In the Hebrew we find
cbir (with the supplied vowel, as is usual,) the identical word. Then why are we
to go any further ; more
particularly as the Hebrew word means exactly what we should
expect, namely, strong, powerful? The same word is also found in the Arabic, Kabir,
and has the same meaning.
Mr. Vallencey and M. Pictet have wished to derive this from the word '|3|'1 hor, or
chbr, consociar.-it, and :HWQH librim, or chbrim, socii, making the letter which is by the
author called simply la into ck, a sound which it has given to it in most grammars, and
changing the 3 b into c, thus: chaverim, sacii. It does not seem to be of much con-
sequence from which the word is derived. It is not improbable that both names were
applied to these same gods. It is probable that in Tuscany they were called Dii Socii,
in Pho:-:nicia perhaps Dii Potes. In Greece they were certainly called Om 'éwa-ru, Dii
Potes. In Sanscrit Cabz' or Cavi means a learned or wise man; and the physicians of
that country are called Cabi-rajas, to whom is applied, as was formerly the case in these
Western countries, the idea of possessing the magic art. These gods might very naturally
have the two names of God associated, and Gods powerful.
Dii Potentes being the meaning of the word Cabiri, it is obvious, that it is in a great
measure
applicable to all the diferent theories ot' the philosophers who have written
respecting them. It is equally applicable whether they be considered to be three, seven,
eight, or twelve, in number. This accounts also for the circumstance that each of the
diferent writers on the subject appears, whether he calls them three or twelve, to prove
his position. At diferent times in the thousands of years, at diferent places in the
thousands of miles, they consisted of diferent numbers. In some countries they might
he three in number, in others twelve: but whether three, eight, or twelve, they were
still the Cabiri, the Dii potentes, the omnipotent Gods; still retaining characteristic
traits of resemblance, however much they may have varied in particular instances-a
variation which was almost impossible to tail of taking place, under the circumsmnces
which have been detailed above.
From this long digression we will now return to the consideration of the word
Samhan or Saman. In Section xviii. it was observed, that it was said in an old Irish
glossary, the magic of Sam/ian, that is to
say, Cabur. And here, though we be likened
to that good man Corporal Trim, in his history of the kings of Bohemia, we must make
another digression: What is the meaning of the word magic 2 It is well known that the
magi were nothing more than the priests of Persia-priests of the religion of Zoroaster,
and magic the doctrine taught by them. It might be perhaps only their secret doctrines;
and it is probable that this was the case. Then the magic of Samhan, or Saman, or
Cabur, will be the secret doctrines of thepowerjial one.
(179)

In the ancient traditions of the Phoenicians, the Cabiri are said to have been seven
in number, and to have had an
eighth associated with them, under the name of Esmun. It
was the same with the Cabiri of Egypt, who represented the seven planets, with Phtas
at their head, making an eighth. The very same
history is related by the Irish. Their
gods or Cabiri were said to have been seven in number, and to have had an eighth asso-
ciated with them, under the name of Saman.
In the first verse of Genesis it is said,
"
In the beginning (Aleim) God created or
made or formed the heavens, Z'D(2)fl esmim, esamim. This word the learned and or-
thodox Dr. Parkhurst has translated, and shewn to mean the planetary bodies, which
were supposed by the magi and astrologers to have an influence over the affairs of men.
He has called them, t/le disposers of the qfairs of men. These bodies, as known to the
ancients, were seven in number. Each planet had its name, and the whole were called,
in the Chaldee dialect, Samzh; and with the emphatic article H e, THE Samin. With
the mysteries the Samin were lost; but the God :W sm, the root of Saman or Esmun,
remained.
The analogies between the Esmun of the Phmnicians and the Saman of Ireland are
striking. Both terminate the chain of the Cabiri : both are
gods of death: both are
ap-
plied to the sun, the source of light and life : both are at the head of seven others; though
inferior and subject to another superior' being, the highest and last of the Irish gods,
called Baal, or Seadhac.
An inspection of M. Pictet's scheme, will shew, that he considers Samhan as the
mediator placed in order between Baal, the supreme Lord ot' the Israelites,-1' and the
inferior Gods. It is probably true, that he was the mediator or preserver of the
Persians--the Mithra. He has all the attributes of this personage. All this tends to
place beyond doubt the Fact, that the Druidical system and that of Persia and India were
the same, though the details as made out by Messrs. Vallencey and Pictet, may be open
*
M. Pictet observes ingeniously,
"
The name even of Esmun (under another form, Schmum, Creuz, Vol. II.
p. 326,) seems, by the metathesis so hequent in the Oriental languags, to be identiml with Semun and Saman, (u
in Persian, Zaman, and Azman, the havens). In line, Saman, as god of death, (Balsah,) was called Cciail, the devil;
and in the Georgian language Esehmani (Esmun P) signihes also the devil, the evil spirit, thedsuoyet.
Baal-zebub in the Ibemo~CeItic means lord ofdeath. .Baal is lord, and :ab death. Thus Balrab, in Ibemo-Celtic.
VALL. Col. Rub. Ihb. Vol. III. p. 447.
Almost all learned men, having mtered into a
conspiracy to make learning ridiculous, have made the words Baal-
zehub or Belzehub to mean LORD or runs. This arose from their proper and meritorious contempt, like that of
the ancients above-mentioned, Ear the knowledge of all languages except the Greek and Latin. A corruption in the
Greek version furnishes but a weak excuse for such laughable credulity.

to objection, or may not in every point be correct. It is not probable that the details of
the system should ever be made out so
exactly as that their several parts should be free
from some plausible objections.
The seven planetary Gods, or Gods of fire, were considered each as a. God by himself;
a
person. But the whole were considered as another which formed the eighth. They
might be considered correctly as seven persons and one God. There is no form of lan-
guage to convey the idea, except that used for the Christian Trinity. As the Christian
Trinity consists of three persons and one God, so the Druid system consisted of seven
persons and one God: and this formed afterward the ever-happy Octoad of the Christian
heretics Valentinus, Basilides, and Bardesanes.
BALL.-CRAP. V. SECT. XXIII.
The supreme God above the rest was called, Seadhac and Baal. Seadlzac is the Sydie
of Eusebius* of whom the Cabiri were the sons. In the ancient Hebrew books, the
book Sohar and Sopher Jetziro, Beresit Rabba, 1' translate the word p13* sdlr, Zeng. The
Irish Seadh looks very like the Hebrew "IW sdi, Saddai, the Omnipotent.
Th name of Baal, which is synonymous with Seathar or Seadluzc, is found in Wales,
e
Gaul, and Germany. This God is also called Bel or Beli. In Hebrew Baal is written
1313Bal.WiththeWelsh,theGodBelorBeliwascalledHu.;OntheErstofMay Bal. With the Welsh, the God Bel or Beli was called Hu.; On the Erst of May
th I 'sh made reat tires in honour of Bel or Baal, and oifered him sacrifices. They
e rx g
have yet a festival on the first of May called Bealtine, when, on the tops of their hills,
they light great fires.
In one of the Welsh Triads, a collection of aphorisms supposed to be very ancient,
Britain is called the island of Bel, and in an old Welsh prayer it is said, "
Sincerely I
worship thee, Beli, giver of good, and Manhogan, the king, who preserves the honours of
BEL, the island of Beli.§
On the subject of this Bel or Beli, Mr. Maurice observes,
"
It is Cicero [| who
acquaints us, that the Indian Hercules is denominated Belus, and I hope hereafter in
the regular history of ancient India, to make still more and more evident what has already

flourish, in every colony that emigrated from Asia, deeply blended with their history and
interwoven with their mythology. He was, as before observed, and the fact ought to be
perpetually borne in mind, constantly compared, for the splendour of his actions and rhg
extent of his power, to the sun that illuminates and seems to govern the world: and the
name of Baal or Bel, was
equally applied to both the monarch and the orb. Of these
assertions there cannot, in any nation, be given more
striking and direct proofs than have
already been brought forward respecting their prevalence in Britain: here the sacred
fires in honour of Belus once flamed over the whole island. Mr. Toland, in that part of
his history of the Druids which has been so often referred to, gives the following account
of these festival lires: '
On May-day eve the Druids made prodigious fires on these
earns, which being every one in sight of some other, could not but aH`ord a
glorious show
over a whole nation. These fires were in honour of Beal or Bealan, Latinized by the
Roman writers into Belenus by which name the Gauls and their colonies understood the
sun. And, therefore, to this hour, the first of May is, by the aboriginal Irish, called la
Bealtine, or the day of Belans' fire. May-day is likewise called La Bealtine, by the
Highlanders of Scotland, who are no
contemptible part ofthe Celtic olfspring. So it is
in the Isle of Man: and in Armorica, a
priest is called Belee, or the servant of Bel, and
the priesthood Belegietln*
Here, as usual, Mr. Maurice gives credit to the imaginary labours of the God Baal,
and thus supposes a Hero and a God, as the Greeks did with their Hercules and Bacchus.
I observed in Chapter III. Section V., that Ausonius had noticed the worship of
Belenus amongst the Armoricans. On this passage, Mr. Bryant says'1' Belin, the Deity
of whom he speaks, was the same as Bel and Balen of Babylonia and Canaan; the Orus
and Apollo of other nations. Herodian takes notice of his being worshiped by the
people of Aquileia; and says that they called him Belin, esteeming him the same as
Apollo. Herodian, Lib. viii. of the Aquileians Inscriptio vetus Aquileiaa reperta

In the 2d book of Kings,¢ the Canaanites are said to have passed their children
through the fire to Baal, which seems to have been a common practice: and Ahaz, king
of Israel, is blamed§ for having done the same
thing.
In Ireland, this superstitious practice still continues. On particular days, great 'fires are
lighted, and the fathers, taking the children in their arms, jump or run through them, and
thus pass their children through them. They also light two fires at a little distance from
each other, and drive their cattle between them. This Phoenician practice was
expressly
forbidden in Deut. xviii. 10. Many places in Ireland are called after this God; a
Baltimore, Baltinglass, &c.: and there are many proverbs relating to him. May is

Ledwich, Mr. Pinkerton, and others, can shut their eyes -to these numerous facts, I can-
not imagine. I can scarcely conceive any thing better proved, than the intimate con-
nexion between Ireland and ancient Phcanicia.
CHODIA-~GOD.=CHAP. V. SECT. XXIV.
The Irish Chodia God, is in fact the Sanscrit word Codam or Cod, God. The C, the
third letter of the English, is taken from the G, the third letter of the Hebrew and Greek,
Gimel and Gamma, as I have before observed.
TEUTATES, TUISCO, THOTH.-'CHAIR V. SECT. XXV.
The Tuisco of Germany, or Teutates of Gaul, had exactly the same meaning, signi-
fying
"
God, the Father of all Beings." This was no other than the God Tliot/I ofthe
Egyptians-the God Mercury, to whom Tuesday in all these nations was dedicated. If
the Celtae had taken this God from the Romans, they would not have called him by his
Egyptian name, Tuisco or Teutates, but Mercury. The identity of the Gods cannot
for a moment be doubted. The dedication to the same day of the week proves it.1'
It is very well worthy of observation that these planets, to which all the nations upon
earth dedicated their days of the week, had Celtic names, and were Celtic Gods. The
Celtic name for day was Di, and the Sanscrit name Divos, and the name for Sunday
Diesul; the last syllable denoting the sun, from which the Romans had their sol-and
not, as
they absurdly imagined, from the word solus alone: for surely a body accom-
panied by a number of planets, as they well knew, could not be called alone! The
second was from the word Lun, the moon, from which the Latins made Luna. The third
day of the Celta was Di-meurs or Dimers, whence came the Mamers and Mars of the
Sabines and Osci. The fourth day was Di~mercher, the Mercury of the Gauls. The
fifth day was Di-Jou, whence the Romans got their dies Jupiter, Di-Jou-pater. Their
sixth day was Di-Guener, or Di-Wener, whence the dies Veneris; and lastly, their Di-

They had also a

ti-om whom Friday was called: she was the sister of Jou and Sadwrn. It seems to me
to be impossible to doubt the intimate relationship which has subsisted in some way or
other between the natives of Ireland and Britain, and the Asiatic nations, in former times.
On the whole, nothing can be more striking than the observation of PIiny,§ who,
seventeen or
eighteen hundred years ago, speaking of the Druids of Britain, says
"

In a very learned dissertation, at the end of his Treatise on the Sybils, he shews that
this was fabricated by a colony of Dorian Phmnicians, from the city of Doro, or Dora,
near Mount Carmel, between Ptolemais and Cesarea, in Syria. He supposes they were
some of the same persons who erected the two famous pillars near Tangiers, urbs Tifyig
which Procopius' says, had on them a Phoenician inscription of the following import:
'Hang |a'p.nv ol ¢U10;ll§ aura arpoenmre I11a'é' 'rs
A1455 via Navi-nos ii sumus qui iiigerunt
a facie Josua praedonis, lilii Nane-We are of those who fled from the face of Joshua
the Robber, the son of Nun.
This Hercules he describes from Lucian, as Summus decrepitus, recalvaster, reliquis
capillis prorsus canis, cute rugosa, et in nigerrimum colorem exusta, quales sunt nautaa
senes.
He supposes he was the same who built the temple at the pillars of Hercules, which
Appian, in lbericis, says, was built by the Phaenicians, and where the worship was con-
ducted after the manner of the Phmnicians; and that the God worshiped was not the
Theban but the Tyrian Hercules. Gallaeus then observes, that the language of Phos-
nicia, and the Hebrew and Chaldee, are very similar, as is witnessed by the Pmnulus of
Plautus and Jerom, and by Priscian, who says, Pozni quasi Phoeni, quorum lingua
Hebreaa ex
parte est coniinis, lzic lib. v. Lingua Pmnorum Chaldem vel Hebrew similis.
He then derives the word Magusan from the Chaldee word in 2 Sam. xix. 17, and Isaiah
xvi. ll: pm mgzn, txansvehentes. From hence the Chaldeans have the word :tmp
mgiza, navis trajectoria, transitus. When all the other circumstances are considered, the
etymology can scarcely be doubted. Here the Romans found this Hercules, and they
adopted him, and made the inscription to his honour. Gallsus then goes on to shew,
that the Melcarthus, or Melicerta of the Greeks, and the Hercules Magusanus, were the
same God. That Melcarthus is derived from the words Rnnp 'fm mlc krta, Melee
Cartha, Rex or Dominus Karthae, a city of Spain, built by the Tyrians.

impossible, supported as these Gods are by festivals, &c. &c., still existing, to doubt
the identity of the two systems, and I fear I shall be thought to have said too

mn CULDEES.-CHAP. v. sacr. xxvnr.
Having, as I conceive, prepared my reader to run riot a little in the mazes of etymo-
logy, I shall now introduce him to Dr. Jamieson's friends the Cnnnazs. I think I
cannot hitherto be accused of much licentiousness in my etymological investigations,
and that I may now claim alittle liberty.
In the early history of the Christian church, in Britain and Ireland, we meet with an
order of priests called Culdees. They were common to both countries. St. Bemard
says, they almost swarmed in Bangor and Down; and Bede describes them as a most
excellent people, living retired from the world. They had a
very celebrated monastery
in the island of Iona, and others in remote situations, and these situations, by accident
or design, mostly the former possessions of the Druids. They were of both sexes, and
chastity was esteemed the most excellent of all virtues.
We find these people existing previously to the arrival of Augustin, in 597, both in
Ireland and England; indeed, from the earliest times of which we have any records.
But they must have difered greatly from the Romish monks, or they would not have
been persecuted by them, and massacred as
they were by the Osgmen on their arrival in
Ireland. Nor would they have been banished from their monasteries in Scotland, as we
are told that they were by Bede, wherever he had the power. In both countries the
Benedictine order was substituted in their place. Of course, in all this Protestants
will see
only priests of a later corrupt church persecuting the professors of the more
ancient and pure doctrines: but they do not tell us how these more pure Christian
doctrines, priests or monks, came to Britain and Ireland before Christianity had arrived
with their fabled Patrick, or their, perhaps, real Augustin. In the Irish monkish histo-
ries they are said to have come from the East, to have been governed by the Egyptian
rule, and to have been divided into three classes, answering to the Coenobites, Anacho-
rets, and Sarabaites. They appear to have worn a white dress, similar to that of the
ancient Essenes and modem Carmelites.

remote antiquity, by an order of Druidesses, who were succeeded in later times by an
order of Christian Nuns.
Dr. Aikin observes, that Caesar and Tacitus are full on the predictive and sacred
qualities of the German women ; Velleda, a Dmidess, was long looked up to by them as a
deity. The Northerns° called them Alirunaz, and in Irish, Alamnaighef is the wise man
acquainted with secrets. St. Bridgit is said to have planted the Nuns at Kildare, and
to have entrusted to their care the holy fire. This fire was never blown with the mouth,
that it might not be polluted, but only with bellows; (The reader will recollect that the
old Irish had a Goddess called Bridgit.) This fire was precisely like the fire of the Jews,
which was fed with peeled wood, and was never blown upon with the mouth. Nadab
and Abihu were punished with death for olfering incense to God with other fire. Mr.
Hyde§ informs us, that this was exactly the same with the ancient Persians,| who fed
their sacred fire with the peeled wood of a certain tree called Hawm Magorum.1[ It
was, I believe, in Col. Vallencey's works, (indigesta moles doctrinae,) where I some time
ago met with an assertion, that the sacred fire of Ireland was fed with the wood of the
same tree called Hawm. I regret exceedingly that I cannot now find it. "
Ware, the Roman priest, relates, that at Kildare the glorious Bridgit was rendered
illustrious by many miracles and notable things, amongst which is the sacred fire of St.
Bridgit, which was kept burning by nuns, ever since the time of the Virgin.~|'1' In the
monastery was a
building called 'rua Fran nous!-:, the ruins of which are yet shown.
An anonymous author says it was ordered to be extinguished by a bishop of Dublin, in
the year 1220, because it seemed to be an imitation of the Vestal fire of Numa Pom-
pilius. But he adds, that it was not extinguished till the suppression of the monasteries
in the time of Henry the Eighth.:l¢

Christian Saint. Persons of fertile imaginations, perhaps. may think they see in the

uailg/le, something very similar to the prophets or wise men, the seers as they were called,
of the Jews.
Dr. Henry, in his History qfEngland, has observed, that collegiate or monastic in-
stitutions existed amongst the Druids. Through the mist of antiquity they may with
diiliculty, though perhaps with certainty, be discerned. The colleges of the prophets,
named in the books of Kings and Chronicles, are discernible with similar difliculty, but
perhaps with more
certainty, than those of the Druids, but in each case their nature must
remain a subject of doubt.
As the monks and nuns were here, as it is acknowledged, before the arrival of Ch,-is,
tianity with St. Augustin, what can these monastic orders have been? We are
obliged
to have recourse to the Druids whether we wish it or not. In the most
early records of
antiquity we
every where meet with people answering to our idea of monks. Perhaps
the earliest record may be that of the sixth chapter of Numbers, and from that it is
evident, that, under the name of Nazarites, they were then existing in Egypt; for the
expression of Moses implies their previous existence. They seem to have been like the
present race of different orders or habits of life, Monks, Nuns, Hermits, Mendieam
Friars, varying in diferent times and diferent countries, but still all monastic: all having
the same generic character, and probably all derived from the same
original. I have
already stated, that it is the belief of the Roman Church that the Carmelites existed
before the time of Christ, and were descended from Elias; and it would be no difficult
matter to prove, that those very Carmelites were the Essenes or Therapeutae of Philo
and Josephus. Probably the persons regulated by Elias were
nothing more than a va-
riety of the persons treated of in the book of Numbers. In short, there is no
period ot'
time so early as that the existence of monastic orders in it may not be perceived.
The Druidesses were divided into three classes. The first were those who had vowed
perpetual virginity, and lived together in communities separate from the world. Mela-r
gives a description of one of these nunneries. It was situated on an island in the British
sea, and contained nine of them. Strange accounts are told of their magical incantations,
&c. &c., just what, under the circumstances, might be expected. They are said to have
pretended to possess an oracle. The second class were married, but spent their time in
com
any with the Druids, and in the oiiices of religion; having conversation only
P
occasionally with their husbands. 'l`he third class was the lowest, and were, in fact,
only servants in the temples and attendants on the Druids.
The existence of female Druids is further confirmed by two stories told by Vopiscus
and by Elius Lampridius. The first of these, from the information given by Dioclesian
himself to Maximian, and by him related to the author's grandfather, says, that Dioclesian
o Q Kings xxii. 14. 1* Lib. iii. cap. ii.; Borlaae, ch. ix.

conceived the first hope of his future greatness, when only an inferior omcer, in an inn,
"
spud Tungros," from the prophecy of a female Druid, who said, "
Dioclesiane, jocare
noli ; nam
Imperator eris cum aprurn occideris.'? The story of Lampridius, which is
in the Life of Alexander Severus, records, that Mulier Druias exeunti exclamavit, Gallico
sermone, Vadas, nec victoriam speras, nec militi tuo credas l*
An inscription was found at Metz to this eB`ect: "
Arete Druis Antistita." Mac-
culloch says,
"
This should imply a female establishment, a Druidical nunnery."~|~
The account in Tacitus of female Druids looks very like what might be expected of the
females of a monastic order, assaulted in their last retreat. He says,
"
Suetonius Pauli-
nus prepared, therefore, to invade Mona, an island full of inhabitants, and a retreat for
fugitives. For this purpose he caused ships to be made with flat bottoms for a
steep,
uncertain shore. In these the foot were conveyed over; the cavalry followed, by fording
in deep Water, or
swimming, and towing the horses. On the shore stood a
motley troop
of armed men, mixed with women running up and down among them, dressed like furies
in black garments, their hair dishevelled, and torches in their hands. The Druids also
attended, lifting up their hands to heaven, and uttering dreadful execrations. The novelty
ofthe sight so struck the soldiers, that they stood, as it were, motionless, exposing them-
selves to the enemies' weapons till, animated by the exhortations of the general, and en-
couraging one another not to fear an army of women and madmen, they advanced, bore
down all they met, and involved them in their own fire. Garrisons were afterward
placed in the towns, and the groves sacred to their bloody superstitious cut down: for it
was their practice to o5`er the blood of their prisoners on their altars, and consult the
Gods by the entrails of men."1
It has been observed that alter the time of the Romans, the Druids seem to have been
seldom heard of in the middle of the island.
A single passage of Strabo's is suliicient to account for the last remains of them being
found in Ireland, Mona, Man, and the extreme points of Scotland. He says,
*'
Ob ne-
fanda ha-xc sacrificia omnem Druidum superstitionem tollere tentarunt Romani, sed
frustra," i. e. on account of their wicked sacrifices the Romans endeavoured to destroy
all the superstition of the Druids, but in vain. Of course they fled from their persecutors
as far as
they could get. Hence we do not often hear of them except in the extreme
parts of the island, which the Romans were unable to conquer.
From the circumstances related above by Tacitus, Mr. Rowland concludes that Mona
was the capital settlement, the Canterbury, or the Archiecopiscopal seat, of the Druids
in Britain. From being a
very convenient, connecting link of the chain with Ireland,
it was probably always a
place of considerable importance with them ; but I think he

goes too far. He says,
"
If these Druids' chief seat or residence had been in any other
part of the then conquered Britain, (and, indeed, into what part of it had not the Roman
army at one time or other reached? ) how came it to pass that we had not some account,
in some author, of such an
appearance of these Druids' playing their last game, (pro aria
e¢_fbc1k,j as we have it by Tacitus, in this isle of Mona ?" The answer is, because they
did not
play their last game till they found themselves driven to what they considered
their last hold in this isle. Insulam incolis validam et
perhigarum receptaculum, as
Tacitus calls it.
Mr. Davies* says,
"
Into that sequestered scene, Mona, the Druids, who detested
warthre, had retired a&er the irruption of the Romans. They had deserted their ancient
magnificent seat at
Abury, and their circular uncovered temple on
Salisbury plain, in
which the Hyperborean sages had once chaunted their hymns to Apollo, or
Plenyz."
CHALDEES OF THE JEWS.1Cl-IAP. V. SECT. XXX.
We read in the books of the Jews constantly of the Chaldees or the Chaldeans, but it
is only in the book of Daniel that we can
expect to find them speaking of themselves.
They were an order of priests. It is probable that there never was
any separate nation
oi' them.
Ambrosius Calepine'|° reckons the Persian Magi, the Gallic Druidae, and the Assy-
rian Chaldee to have been all the same, so that I am not singular in my opinion.
It is probable that the Chasdim or Chaldees might, like the Druids in Gaul, at last
get possession of the government; for we find Divitiacus, the chief ruler there, was a
Druid. And it is certain, that, in some cases, they succeeded by hereditary descent, like
the priests of the Jews. Of all the books of the Bible, that of Daniel is most
likely to
give us a correct idea of them; from the other books we hear of them only as objects of
reprobation. The word Chaldees in the Jewish writings, often means demons, robbers.
At the 2nd verse of the second chapter of Daniel, it is said, Then the king commanded
to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and t/re Chaldeans, for to
shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
4-. Then spake the C'/raldeans to the king in Syriac.
10. The Clialdeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the
earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no
king, lord, nor ruler, that
asketh such things at any magician, or
astrologer, or Chaldezm.

CHALDEAN PRIESTS THE SAME AS THE MAGI.-CHAIR V. SECT. XXXL
The religion and the learning of the Babylonians, are so blended together, that it is
dilicult to separate them into two distinct heads: for the Chaldees, properly so called,
were not only the priests, but also their learned men. These Chaldees were more dis-
tinguished from the people than the clergy are from the laity with us, and were as much
revered in their country as the Egyptian priests were in theirs, and are said to have
enjoyed the same privileges! They pretended to prophesy and were great magicianssl'
'

1' Mr. Larcher in a note on a passage of Herodotus, (Clio, clxxxi., Beloe, p. 247,) says,
"
Belus came originally
from Egypt. He went, accompanied by other Egyptians, to Babylon: there he established priests; these are the
personages called by the Babylonians, Chaldeans. The Chaldeans carried to Babylon the science of astrology,
which they learned from the Egyptian priests." 'Huis serves to shew I.areher's opinion, that the Chaldees were only
primts, though be is quite wrong respecting the place they came from.
BRYANIJS AND AIKIN,S ACCOUNT OFTHE C1-IALDEES.-CHAP. V. SECT. XXXII. 191
As usual amongst the Greeks, in matters
relating to
foreigners, we find the utmost
confusion respecting these people: different nations being called by this name. Bochart
proves, that they gave the name of Chaldaei or Xa7~8a.To» to
many nations. They may have
had a settlement somewhat similar to what the Druids had in Anglesey or Man, but I do
not think that they could ever be said to have formed a
separate or distinct nation. They
were precisely like the Magi, out of whom some persons have been disposed to make a
nation) The Tzabeans, the Chaldeans, and the Tuscans, were all orders of priests, the
latter of the Pelasgi or Etrusci. It was
by these Chaldeans that the astronomical
observations were made, which were brought from Babylon in the time of Alexander.
They were
very celebrated tbr their learning and knowledge, particularly respecting the
motions ofthe heavenly bodies, that is, astrologysf For astrology was
always considered
a leading branch of knowledge in those times.;
BRYANIJS AND AIKIN'S ACCOUNT OF THE CHALDEES.-CHAP. V. SECT. XXXII.
Mr. Bryant§ has very plausibly held, that hy the Amazons were only meant priests ot
the sun; that they were the sarnc as the Chaldzei, and as the Iiinim; that they founded
the twelve cities of Ionia, and amongst the rest, Cuma, as is proved by coins.
Of the Chaldeans, Dr. Aikin says,
"
The Chaldeans, or Celts, in fact flourished along
the Euphrates, and supplied a vast mass of population to Judea. One division ot' them
settled on the Euxine coast, and bequeathed their name to Galatia. From among these
Galatians, probably in consequence oi' the inroads of Sesostris, that tribe of Gaels ap-
pears to have crossed the Euxine, which strolled along the middle zone of Europe,
occupied in early ages the north of Italy, laid Rome in ashes during the time of Camil-
lus, gave its name to Gaul, and was finally pushed, by the ensuing wave of Cimbri, ti-om
the mouths of the Loire into Ireland. There the language of this oldest of the northern
European tribes is still in some degree preserved. It is said to resemble the Punic
seen in Plautus, and has been employed to decipher the soliloquy of Hnuno. The
Fins of Lapland are
thought to have branched fiom the same stock."
It' Dr. Aikin be correct in the Chaldeans and Celts being the same
people, it is not
difficult to account for a
colony of them being found by the name ot' Culdees in Scot-
*
The ooimtry of the Magi is often named, but they were
only prists of a
country. The kings of the are
olien named in the Romish church, but from Tertullinn and others it is evident, that what were called kings were only
a rank or order in the priesthood, and answered almost correctly to our kings at arms of the order of Heralds.

1 It is observed by Mr. Vallencey, that the Chaldeans were celebrated for the manufacture of linen, which he sup-
poses that the Irish received from them.

land. This idea of Dr. Aikin's is nearly allied to that of the Chaldeans being the
priests of the people residing on the Euphrates, or of the Celtae. But the first migra-
tion which brought the sixteen letters, must have been long prior to Cyrus. They must
have come some time before Moses, and that a considerable time.
Mr. Huddleston states Suadh or Suidh, pronounced Sui, to be the radix of the Latin
suadeo; that Suidlx Bheil, pronounced Sui-Beil, signified the counsel of Bel, which,
Graacized, became Sybela or Sybilla. In Aquitaine, in Gaul, was a
people called Sybil-
lates." This was most likely from the temple of Apollo or Bel in Assyria, served by
the Chaldees, one ofthe first of his temples.-r
Mons. Baillie says;
"
The Chaldeans (they say) were originally a
college of priests,
instituted by Belus, on the model of those of Egypt." This he disbelieves, and shews§
that they did not come from Egypt; but yet, that they were strangers at Babylon, and
that they were said to come there with Evechous, who was the first king' of Babylon
that bore the name of Chaldean.
When the Assyrians first began to cultivate the earth, those who dwelt in the wilder-
ness were called Chaldeans.|| In like manner when the borders of Europe began to be
settled and cultivated by the land-workers, we hear ofthe Celtze, from the utmost bounds
of the East to those of the West, variously pronounced Khaltee, Qualtee, Gualtee, Ga-
latee; from Khaldt, Waldt, an
original word, signifying wood. 111 like manner, 51086
woods, hills, or downs, which in the most western parts of Europe have been called
Dun-keld, in the eastern, in Greece especially, are called Calydonian; nay, our wolds
in the southern, as well as in the northern parts of' Britain, were by the Romans univer-
sally called Calydonia.1|`
According to Mr. Whitaker also, the words Gathel, Gael, Gatal, Galt, Gaeld and Celt,
are all the same, and signify wood-lander. The word is known to mean wood-lander, or
resident in the wood, in opposition to the residents of cities."

THE CULDEES succnnnnn BY HEREDITARY nsscnsr.-cnar. v. sncr. xxxrrr.
The Culdees of the British Isles were, in many other respects besides their names,
similar to the Chaldees of Assyria.
It appearsf that they succeeded to their office by hereditary descent in the church ot
St. Andrew's, leaving their property to their wives and children when they died. And
in Ireland also, in the church of Armagh, where this body had great influence, there was
an hereditary succession for fifteen generations. The prior was a
layman in the capacity
of chanter of that church.;
Mr. Huddleston has given a curious account from the registry of the priory of St.
Andrew's of the dedication of that church, till that time called Kilrimont, to St. Andrew,
by king Hungus and bishop Regulus, in the year 82.5. From this it appears not to
have been before dedicated to any saint. He says, the word Kilrimont means
temple an
the lcing's mount. I think it probable that their bishop Regulus had become converted
to the Roman faith, and that in consequence the monks were
obliged to submit; for what
could they do against their prior and the king? But "
they continued to
perform
divine worship in a certain corner of the church after their own manner ;" and the
register adds, "
nor could this evil be removed till the time of king Alexander, of blessed
memory," in 1124; so that the Culdees and Popish priests performed their service in
the same church, for nearly 300 years.§ But it seems, from various circumstances, that
in the latter part of their existence, a
feeling against their having wives gradually gained
ground. This probably arose from the strong dislike of the Romish zealotes, their
neighbours, to this practice.
It is allowed by Dr. Jamieson, that they had a rule of some sort, but he has not given
it to us ; an omission which I am not able to supply.||
The fact of the Culdees having succeeded by hereditary descent, is extremely important.
It is so very different from the practice under the Christian religion, that it tends strongly
to confirm the suspicion that these people were Druids. It is no where to be found
°
Abraham is said to have come irom Ur of the Chaldees. I suspect this does not mean from the town of Ur of
the Chaldees, but from the Ere, or fire-worship ofthe Chaldees.

except where the Druids have been. Thus in Bretagne, whose inhabitants were Celta-2,
and the priests Druids, it prevailed till it was abolished by Hildebert, Archbishop ot'
Tours, in his provincial council, in l127. In the end of the same century, Giraldus
Cambrensis complains of it as one of the disgraces of Wales, (where, as well as in
Ireland, Culdees remained till his time,) that sons got the churches after their fathers by
succession and not election, possessing and polluting the church of God by inheritance."
DERIVATION OF THE WORD CULDEE.=CHAP. V. SECT. XXXIV.
Dr. Smith, Messrs. Goodall and Shaw, wish to derive the word Culdee from Keile, a
servant, and Dia God, merely Latinized, and that from this came our Cel or Kil, so often
found joined to our churches and towns, as Kildare, &c. But the Greek word for monks
is Kamewmiz and Dr. Jamieson's remark1' seems more probable, that they had their
names from this, the meaning of which was
people called or
separated to God. And he
thinks that the name of Kil, so often joined to our places of worship, comes from this.
I think it not improbable that the Greek word came, like so many others, from the Celtic.
It is the fashion to run down etymological researches ; but though they may be often
fanciful, yet they are often not carried as far as they might be. Who would think of
deriving Culdee from Kasdim ? :'|w: ksdim. Yet it is no more unreasonable than to
derive Chaldeans from it-a derivation which no one denies, but without which no one
would have thought of deriving the Culdees horn it.
Dr. Jamieson, in every part of his history, has made it apparent that they existed long
before there were any bishops, and for a long time, even after there were bishops, inde-
pendent of' them and in spite of them. There is not a particle of credible evidence ot'
the time when they began to exist; for who will believe a word of the /iyperbolical
expressions of Tertullian, the Montanist, whose lies Mr. Moyle has well exposed; or of
the stories of king Donald, or the disciples of John the Apostle? It is very possible
that some individual missionaries may have come to Scotland or Ireland ; but the evidence
on which we have it cannot be depended on. What dependence can be placed on such
witnesses as Bede, who, it is evident from Dr. Jamieson's admissions; did not know
Scotland from Ireland, as in his Chronicle he calls those Scoti, whom in his History he
calls Hibemi!
LAST REMAINS OF THE CULDEES IH YORKSHIRE.-CHAP. V. SECT. XXXV.

within sight of the ancient British capital Iseur. Isurium, now
Aldborough, and of the
famous Druidical temple at Brimham Craggs. This Brimham, or Brimmon, or Brim-
man, is a
very curious place. And when I consider all the circumstances attending it, I
cannnot resist the temptation of hazarding an
etymology, though it may be thought
tar-fetched. May it not come from the words Beth-rimmon, abbreviated as
Amesbury
was abbreviated from Ambres-bury? In Ireland I learn from Colonel Vallencey, that the
sun, moon, and stars, were called collectively Rimmin. In the second book of Kings'
it is said, "
My master goeth into the house of Rimmon," IQ1 mm. The Rimmin of
one country, explains the Rimmon of the other. A place of the same name is to be
tbund not far from the temple at Rolwrich. And after all that may be said, this is not
so far-fetched as Chaldean from Kasclim.
Iseur was the capital of the Brigantss, as well as of all Britain ; and was removed to
York, the Celtiberian settlement or town of Evora or Ebora, Latinized Eboracum, by
the Romans after they had conquered the country; probably at the time they turned the
road from Iseur or Aldborough through Boroughbridge,1' where it now
passes. This
town was
probably built out ofthe Druidical temple there, of which only three immense
pillars now remain. The numerous beautiful mosaic pavements yet to be seen at Ald-
borough, prove its ancient magnificence. The word Iseur is curious--it signifies Saviour,
trom the Hebrew word _Ulm iso, to save. The Persians applied this epithet to the sun,
as Mithra, or the sun which saved them annually from the empire of Ariman, or dark-
ness, the six months of winter. In York, one of the streets which runs into the most
ancient part of the town, called Aldborough, is called Saviour Gate. Thus the new
citizens imitated the old ones, in the names of their streets.
If this shews nothing else, it shews that they knew the meaning of the old ones. I
shall be told that Saviour-gate was so called for a
very different reason.
Perhaps it
was; but the words Aldborough and Iseur in one place, and Aldborough and Saviour-
gate in the other, are oddly connected. Every one must
judge for himself, In Aid.
borough, at York, are the remains of a Heathen temple of Bacchus or
Jupiter. The
latter of these was the god whom the Romans, in spite of their utmost exertions, could
not prevail upon the Druids to worship by the name of Jupiter, or under any other name
than that of lou, or Jou. This proved the extraordinary ignorance both of Britons and
Romans; for Jupiter was
nothing but Iou-pater. Both Bacchus and Jupiter had the
epithet of Em-mp, Saviour; Zeus Soter and Dionusus Soter.1 Sir John Mar-sham had 3,

The magnificent temple of Beth-Rimmon (if I may so venture to call it) stood in the
midst of the forest of Knaresborough, which was of vast extent. Persons are
yet living

member it so covered with oak timber, that a squirrel could pass from Knaresborough
to Skipton without touching the ground. Ripon, Ingryphum, where was a kil or cel
of' the Culdees, in the time of Bede,1' is about eight miles on one side of Bramham, and
Aldborough, Iseur, at the same distance on the other. The situation of' Bramham must

Druids; and a
place in the island was called Pit-an-druch, that is, the grave of the
Druids. He says, I signifies an island in Irish, and is often written Hii, Ii, Hu, to
avoid making a word of one letter." This is not in Mr. Toland's usual style. It is
true that I meant an island, because it meant the island of' I, which might perhaps be
called mp' réaxvyv, the island from its celebrated sanctity. If' we
go to the annalsof
Ulster we find it is called I, Hi, or Aoi. Now I apprehend it ought to be the same as
the inscription in the cave at New Grange, and then it would be the island of' 1

of I or Ii. The i might be doubled, as is common with words in the Hebrew language
when superior emphasis or sanctity is intended, as may be often seen with the word
sabbat, sabbat, sabath. It was the same word as that placed in the front of the temple
of' the god Apollo at Delphi, nw ie, reading the Hebrew from right to left, of Apollo, the
god of the Hyperboreans. Thus it came to be the island of' I, msg' efnx-qv.
Mr. Daviesf says, the Great God was considered by the Welsh the dispenser ofgood,
and was also called Buddwas. The name of Bilddwas is very striking. The Bull was
sacred to this God, of which Mr. Davies has given many examples.;
The Jews, who resided in Egypt, built a temple at a
place called in their books, in the
Hebrew language, pt cm, or sometimes px arm, in our translation on or avon. The Jews
of Jerusalem were very indignant at this, and in one of the versions it is called the city
of' destruction. The Chaldee paraphrast, as
ignorant, as
may be expected from such an
author, not knowing what to make of it, calls it the city of the sun, which is to be
destroyed. The Greeks, not knowing what to make of it, called it the city Helio-
polis, or of' the sun. In the names of' Iona and the Janus or Ianus of the Etruscans,
we have the whole secret of' the au, or aan, or an, of the Jews, dissected or
etymologised
for us. The island of Iona is often called I by itselfi this is in fact, the IE or fn ie, of
the Jews, and the ei of the God Apollo at Delphi, and the an is the name ofthe temple
in Egypt, put together to form Ian, with the Latin form of us, Ianus. An is the Selfl
existing One, and Ie, or Ian, the self'-existing Jah or Jehovah, and amounts in Fact to
the I an 'ran' I am, or I am. The dropping of the second letter of the word H* ie, is
surely no unnatural assumption. It is almost impossible to be avoided. The actual
circumstance of the island of' Iona being commonly and actually called the island of I,
is a very striking illustration of' the principle carried into practice. Again, we have seen
by the annals of Ulster that it is called Hi. Read this in the Greek, from left to right,
and it is the identical word Ei of the God Apollo at Delphi. All this is confirmed in a
very striking manner, by the consideration that Iona was, like the temple at Delphi,

peculiarly dedicated to Apollo. And they were both founded by Hyperboreans. The
reader will not forget that the Irish and the Greek alphabets have been proved to be the
same, the truth of which will be much more clearly shewn by and by. I am well aware
that these etymologies maybe said to he far-fetched, but they must be considered in
conjunction with the other circumstances. And I must beg my reader to suspend his
judgment till he has seen the whole of my work, particularly the Sixth Chapter.
All these words and ideas, too, are
evidently derived from the word mn# Ieue (so
absurdly written Jehovah) of the Jews and Christians, corrupted and debased in every
manner that human ingenuity could conceive. But the Christians have no
right to
complain of the I-Ieathens for having stolen their God Jehovah. They have made repri-
sals, and have stolen ten times as much from the Heathens. They have stolen saints by
scores. Halfthe saints in the Romish calendar are Heathen Gods.
JUPITER. AND JANUS.'-CI-IAP. V. SECT. XXXVIII.
The original of the word Jehovah or Ieue was Ie or Ieu, not Iao, or Iam: the Greek
omega, cv, is a modern corruption, that is, comparatively modern. We constantly read
of the words the Aleim, but in N0 instance do we find 'rua Ieue or 'run Jehovah. The
reason is because the last letter is emphatic, and thus the sacred tetragrammaton might
be rendered THE Ieu. mi Ieu, is Jah; rt-'mi Ieu-e, is 'rua Jah? Hence, as I said
before, comes Father, Zeus, Jen, or Jupiter in every nation upon earth.'|'
In the course of thousands of years, and during its passage through various countries
and languages, it is not surprising that the vau should have changed into the o or the m,
but Mr. Middleton states, that the Gaelic ao is equivalent to the Greek upsilon. Thus,
in fact, there seems to be no real change, but it continues as nearly the same as the two
languages will admit;
Iona was derived from the God rn Ie, and the on of Egypt; these the Romans La-
tinized, and thus made the oldest of all their Gods, Janus or Jonas. It is very evident
that, respecting this double or often four-faced_God, Cicero and all the Romans were
ridiculously ignorant. He was Etruscan, and the oldest of Italy, and that was all they
knew about him. If they had followed the advice of Plato they might, perhaps, have

Dr. Smith says, that the word mostly used bythe Cells for the Supreme Being was Dia or Dhia, which, in the
oblique case, hm De and Dba; that of this the Esus or Hesus, said to haveheenworshiped bythe Druids, seems
only to have been a corruption, and the Gm and Deus of the Greeks and Latina were manifestly derived from it;
that the Dhia or Dia of the Celts is the same m the lah ofthe Hebrews. P. 16-

discovered him. They would have found him amongst the Hyperboreans or Barbarians,
their ancestors, and the teachers of all the science that they knew.
Of this God, Vallencey says,
"
Ian, Ianus; Pater Tuscorum Deus omnium primus;
Irish Ionn, Jehovah, dominus, the Almighty God ; this word has been admitted in the
same sense by the Gomerian Welsh. In the Basque, Ioun, Iauna, God, Lord. In the
Sclavonic, Iunak, a hero (Ir. Aonach) Ionn the head, the upper part. (Shaw.) This
word is often written aan
by the modern Irish, ao and io having the same sound. If I
mistake not, the Irish name of Wednesday, viz., cad-oon, or dia cadiononn the holy day
ot' Ionn, was so named from the worship to the Omnipotent God, assigned on that day.
Ionn was the same as Baal or Belus, with the heathen Irish, and this accounts for Janus
being esteemed the same as Apollo by the Romans. (See Macnonrus, Sat. i. 9.) Some
undertake, says he, to prove Janus to be the sun, and that he is represented double, as
being master of both gates of heaven, because he opens the day when he rises, and shuts
it when he sets. I-Iis statues are marked on the right hand with the number 300, and on
the left 65, to signify the measure ofthe year. Cicero says in his third book ol' Etymo-
logies, that Cornilicius calls him not Janus, but Eanus.' In the ancient poems ot' the
Salii, he is styled the God of Gods. He is drawn with a
key and a. rod. He has twelve
altars, one tbr each month of the year. Marcus Messala, Consul and Augur 55 years,
begins his discourse upon Janus thus: '
He who forms and governs all, united together
the nature of Water and earth, which by their gravity always tend downward, to that ol'
the fire and spirit, which by their lightness mount nimbly upwards, and these he has
confined to the heavens: and to these heavens he has annexed such an attractive force as
unites and binds together different natures and qualities.' This passage of Macrobius is
good authority for the Scythian deity IoNN being the same as the Etruscan Iasus or
Euros, which was his name, and not Janus."
As Janus was the pater deorum of the Irish and of the Etruscans, so was Anu, the
mater deorum Hibernensiumf She was called Anu, Ana, and Anaine.1°

of a
hunting-match, and in whose vault below is part of a
picture, in Mosaic, of a man
filling a wine-cask, found in the floor a few years ago, but which will now be taken
away. Who is he but Bacchus ?-as Mr. Faber has proved, in his Heathen Mythology,
to a demonstration. In the character of Christian saint and martyr, he walked from
St. Denis to Paris, with his head in his hand. As the ignorant monks made a
holy
Denis out of the ruins of the temple and traditions of Bacchus in France, in like manner
they made a St. Columba out of the misunderstood word Iona, which in Hebrew is
rm# Iune, in Latin Columba, and means a dove. Mr. Pennant has observed the
similiarity; he says,'
"
Iona derives its name from a Hebrew word, signifying a dove,
in allusion to the name of the great saint, Columba, the founder of its fame." On this
Dr. Jamieson remarks in a note,
"
This he has probably borrowed from Fordun, who says
of Columba, Hic cum Iona prophets. sortitus est nomen; nam
quod Hebraica lingua
Iona, Latina vero Columba, dicitur." I am persuaded they first Latinized it into Iona,
then blunderecl it into Columba, then all the rest followed like the stories of St. Denis,
&c. &c. I have no doubt that the stories of St. Denis, ofSt. Patrick, and of St. Columba,
are all equally true. It is curious that St. Columba had the good fortune to have a
disciple called Jonas, who wrote his life. Here again is another instance of ignorance,
or roguery, or both.
Mr. Pennant very nearly stumbled on the truth. The language of the islands was a
dialect ofthe Hebrew, or of the same language as the Hebrew, and in it the word Iona
was found to mean dove. Thence came the mistake. A similar mistake aroserespecting
the ass, which the rabble of the Greeks iimcied that they had discovered to be the object
of the worship of the Jews ;1' a blunder similar to that concerning the teeth of' Cadmus.
The Greeks were the greatest blunderers upon earth, unless I except the Irish; but then
Pat has neither their absurd vanity, nor their propensity to lying. He is true and sin-
cere; but who has not heard of the Grzecia Mendax ?
Jon was the same as Baal in Welsh. Jon was the Lord, God, the first Cause. In
Basque, Jauna, Jon, Jona, Jain, Janicoa, Jaungoicoa, meant God, Lord, and Master.
The Scandinavians called the sun Jon. One of the inscriptions of Gruter shews, that
the Trojans adored the same planet by the name ot' Iona.1 In Persian the sun is called
Jawnah. All these names have a near relation to the Etruscan Janus, who was consi-
dered the God supreme-the Deus Deorum.

The Athenians pretended that the Ionian cities were founded by one Ion, who went
from their city in very remote times. But, says Mr. Bryant,'° the Ionim were dengmi-
nated from Iona the Dove. Again, he says that the Peleiades, or Doves, were the female
branch of the Ionim.1' ,
Ag~ain,j;-" The name of the Dove among the Amonians was Ion, and Ionah; some-
times expressed Iiinas, from whence came the Owag, Oinas, ol' the Greeks. The colony
which settled at C umaa, in Italy, went
by the direction of a
Dove.§ As the Dave was
esteemed the interpreter ofthe will ofthe Deity, the priests and soothsayers were, from
that circumstance, called liinah, or Doves." The rites of Dodona were said to have been
brought by a dove, and the women who olliciated were called Hanna: and II¢>.na8|g;
which the Latins rendered Columbae, that is, teachers of divine truth: the Dove being
the teacher of the Divine will for the founding of the temple. Potter|| says, the oracle at
Dodona was founded by a black Dove.1|' All these different expressions come from a mis-
apprehension of the word Ieue, Iam, grown into Jupiter in Latium, and Janus in Tus-
cany-more purely preserved amongst the Druids under the letters Iq, na-le, or Iah,
and the Island of Ior Ii, or the sacred isle. Through all the Heathens, every where,
from India to Thule, I could trace the worship of the God Jehovah, Ieue, if it pertained
to my subject.
The story of St. Columba reminds me of St. Amphibolus. St. Augustin coming to
England, brought with him, of course, a
part of the monastic dress, called, in Latin,
Amphibolus. Thus it was the holy or sacred dress, Amphibolus. In proper time it
came to have suitable adventures ascribed to it as a
person, chapels dedicated to it,
and in short grew into a saint, and in decent time into a
martyr. His adventures may
be met with, if my memory serve me, in the history ot' St. Alban's. The apotheosis of
this old cloak was performed by JeB`ery of Monmouth, and Hector Boece."
The ignorant monks made saints out of every thing. In Ireland, they made St.
Kenny, fiom Cill-Chainnigh or
Kilkenny. From the Shannon, or Senus, they made
St. Senanus, and from Down or Dunum, St. Dunus. If it were worth the trouble,
hundreds of similar instances might be produced.

HUMAN SACRIFICES BY ST. PATRICK.1CHAP. V. SECT. XL.
There is a curious tradition, both of St. Patrick in Ireland, and of St. Columba in
Iona, that when they attempted to found churches, they were impeded by an evil spirit.
who threw down the walls as fast as they were built; until a human victim was sacrificed
and buried under the_fbzma'a!ion, which being done, they stood &rm.° These are
probably
the same
story, and perhaps may have had some foundation, liom the fact of a
proverb
still continuing, which is said to have arisen from it.
I very much fear there is too much truth in this story. Not that I mean that such a
thing was done by either a Christian Patrick or Colurnba, but by the Druids, from whom
the story got fathered upon the former. If there were a Patrick or Columba, of the ex-
istence of both of whom I doubt,I no more believe they would do this, than that the early
Christians ate children, which modern divines have believed. I End some persons absurd
enough to give credit to this story of Patrick.'|' Under each of the twelve pillars of one
of the circular temples in Iona, a human body was found to have been buried, whence it
was
instantly settled that these circles were not temples, but cemeteries. It may as well
be inferred that our churches are not places for worship, because people are buried there.
When I consider the mortifying evidence of Cesar to the shocking state of degradation
with respect to human sacrifices, into which the Druids had fallen, I am obliged, very
unwillingly, to suspect that the game of Hiel was played over again in this temple. Of
this I shall say more in my last chapter.
In Joshua vi. 26, it is written-" Cursed be the man before the Loan, that riseth
up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born,
and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
In the hrst book of Kings, xvi. S4-, it is thus written-" In his days did Hiel the Beth.
elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his first-born, and set up the
gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Loan, which he
spake by Joshua the son of Nun."
Wherever Li!/ioi were used as
sepulchral monuments, they were placed near the body,
not upon it, to crush it to pieces. They were of a nature very different from flat grave-

The abbots or chiefs of the monastery of Iona, were

Disguise the matter how they may, here the Druid evidently peeps out. Both parties
who have written on this subject have a
system to support. The Romanists, to shew
that there have always been Bishops, the Presbyterians to prove that they were not
bishops but Presbyters. But they are
equally averse to their being the remains of the
Druids. I do not mean to insinuate that, in this case, either of the parties have wilfully
suppressed any evidence which might prove the Culdees Druids: but I believe that they
have been so intent, one on making bishops, and the other on overthrowing them, that
they have paid no attention to, or passed over as of no consequence, facts which mlght
shew what they really were.
They are said to have had monasteries or cells all over Scotland: these are
evidently
called from the Celtic word cil.
I suspect, that when the Romanists succeeded in expelling the Culdees from any
monastery, and substituting their own orders, they called it_/banding o

204' COARBS AT IONA._»CHAP. V. SECT. XLII.
Dr. Jamieson allows that the Druids possessed I, before the introduction of Chris-
tianity. An old author quoted by him says, A green eminence close to the sound of I,
is, to this day, called the Druids' 6urying7zlace.* In this place bones have been dis-
interred. The tradition is, that the first Christians banished the Druids, and took pos-
session of their seats. Dr. Jamiesonf says,
"
The tradition that the Culdees succeeded
the Druids, at no
great distance of time, might seem to be supported by a circumstance
of an interesting nature, which has been mentioned by several writers in our statistic
accounts: that Clachan; the name still given in the highlands, to the place where a
church stands, originally belonged to a Druidical temple. Hence it is still said, '
Will
ye go to the stones ?' or
'
Have you been at the stones ?' that is,
'
Will you go to,' or
'
Have you been at church ?' But it is unnecessary to enlarge on this singular circum-
stance, as I have illustrated it pretty fully in another work."
When Columba was said to have come to Iona, it is also said, that he was
opposed by
one Broichan, who was called a
magiczbn. Dr. Smith says, that the word Broichan is
synonymous with Druid, in Gaelic-in short that it means Druid. Adonellus also
relates a
story, that when Columba came to Iona, he found some Druids who opposed
him, and who disguised themselves in the /:abit of mon/rs. All this tends to shew, that
the Culdees and the Druids were the same; that the Culdees were, in fact, Chris-
tianized Druids.
Bede and the monkish legends say, that one Palladius came about the year five
hundred and fifty-Eve, and converted the Picts; and, that king Bridius or Brudi granted
him the island of Hi, or Iona, whereon he founded a monastery. Here a
monastery is
said to be founded, but it was, in iiact, only a
monastery taken possession oi; which was
founded long before; for no one can doubt that this was an establishment of the Druids.
In order to reconcile the interminable confusion in the legendary accounts of St.
Columba, Dr. Jamieson§ is obliged to make out two of this name, or of nearly this name
-Columba and Columban. The accounts in Bede are perfectly ridiculous, and suiii-
ciently shew the character of the whole matter-an idle monkish legend, not a word
of which can be depended on, nor more
worthy of credit than the story of Jack the
Giant-killer.
The particulars of the life of Columba, his miracles and adventures, cannot be received
as matters ofhistory. Bryant says, out of Columba, the dove, they have made a saint,
and out of Iona, a
bishop.[|

It appears from Ware and Giralrlus Cambrensisf' that the Cgu;-bs were kn0Wn both in
Wales and Ireland, though Giraldus says by another name in Wales-that is to say
CoH¢1ei. Their abbots in early times were

They married, and the Coarb-ship descended to their children. They had large posses-
sions in Ireland called Termon-lands. Speaking of them when they were laymen,
Ware says, they got possession of the lands and left only the tithes to the clergy.
The result of all the inquiries which I have made into the history ofthe Culdees is,
that they were the last remains of the Druids, who had been converted to Christianity,
before the Roman church got any footing in Britain. They were
Pythagorean Druidical
monks, probably Essence, and this accounts for their easily embracing Christianity: for
the Essenes were as
nearly Christians as possible. Having nothing to do with the
Roman See, it naturally happened, that their rites differed from those of the Roman
Church considerably. There is reason to believe, that they were an
orderly and pious
race of men, and from what has been said respecting their library in Iona, probably, at
one time, learned.
A very singular circumstance is named by almost all authors who have written re-
specting the Druids, namely, that there were no
martyrs or confessors amongst them,
and that they required no persecution, but came
easily into the profession oi' the Christian
religion. This I think arose from their being in fiict a branch of the Essenes, or
Pytha.

As I just now observed, the Culdees were converted to
Christianity before the arrival
of the Roman missionaries, and their doctrines differed considerably ti-om those of the
Roman church. Dr. Jamieson says, that the monks of Iona were not ordained by the
bishops of Rome, but that they ordained one another at their college of Iona. They
celebrated their Easter after the Orienml or Greek manner.
The Culdees had the custom of the tonsure, but it was not like that of the Roman
church.'|' It seems doubtiiil whether they had the rite of confirmation. They opposed
the doctrine of the real presence. They dedicated their churches to the Holy Trinity,
but not to Saints. They had no service for the dead. They were enemies to the doc-
trine of works of supenerogation. It is probable they had not the mass, nor venerated
relics. They disapproved the doctrines of celibacy.
The tonsure in the Roman church is referred by Isidorej; to the ancient Nazarites, and
after their example to the Apostles.

ST. PJ.1'RICK.--CI-LLP. V. SECT. XLIV.
In the beginning of this chapter I dropped a hint, that I doubted the existence of St.
Patrick. It is very certain from Ware, that no one ever knew where he died, or where
he was hom.
In the following extract from Dr. Ledwich will be found my reasons. There is as
good evidence ofthe existence of St. Denis as of St. Patrick:
"
In Usuard's and the Roman Martyrology, bishop Patrick, of Auvergne, is placed
at the 16th day of March, and on the same
day the office of the Lateran canons, ap-
proved by Pius V., celebrates the festival of a Patrick, the apostle of Ireland. The 17th
of March is dedicated to Patrick, bishop of Nola. Had not Dr. Maurice, then, the best
reasons for supposing that Patricius Auvernensis sunk a
day lower in the calendar, and
made for the Irish a Patricius Hibernensis? This seems exactly to be the case. It is
very extraordinary the 16th and 17th of March should have three Patricks, one ot'
Auvergne, another of Ireland, and a third of Nola! The antiquities of Glastonbury
record three Patricks, one of Auvergne, another Archbishop of Ireland, and a third an
abbot. The last, according to a
martyrology cited by Usher, went on the mission to
Ireland, A.D. 8.50, but was unsuccessful; he returned and died at Glastonbury. If all
that is now advanced be not a fardel of monkish lictions, which it certainly is, the last
Patrick was the man who was heatified by the bigoted Anglo-Saxons, for his endeavours
tobring the Irish to a conformity with the R0lI1|Sh church. °
On this Dr. Aikinf
says,
"
The author now ventures upon the bold attempt of annihilating St. Patrick. It
is an undoubted fact, that this saint is not mentioned in any author, or in any work of
veracity, in the 5th, 6th, 7th, or Sth centuries. His name is in Bede"s Martyrology, but
it is more than probable, that that martyrology is not Bede's; nor am it be conceived
that Bede, in his other works, should never notice the signal service rendered by Patrick
to the Roman church, and the signal miracles wrought by him in its behalf; if he had
ever heard of them, for the old venerahilis was zealously devoted to that church and
its mythology." Thus there seems to be an end of St. Patrick.

CHAPTER VI.
`
IDOLS WERE NOT WOBSHIPED IN THE FIRST AGES.*SEC'1'. I.
WHEN we inquire into the worship of nations in the earliest periods to which we
have access
by writing or
tradition, we find proofs that the adoration of one God, without
temples or
images, universally prevailed.
Few nations had more idols than the polished and enlightened Greeks, but they did not
fall into this error in their early days. It is curious to observe, that the more
elegant,
polite, and learned, these people became, in the same proportion they became the more
degraded and corrupt in their national religion. _
Stukeley says-" Pausanias in Corinthiaeir, writes-' the Phliasians, one ofthe most
ancient colonies in Greece, had a
very holy temple, in which there was no
image, either
openly to be seen or kept in secret.' He mentions the like of a
grove or temple of Hebe,
belonging to that people ; and adds,
'
They give a
mystical reason for it.' The same author
says, in Argol., '
That at Prana, is a
temple of Vesta, no image, but an altar, on which
208 IDOLS WERE NOT WORSHIPED IN THE FIRST AGES.-CHAP. VI. SECT. L
they sacriiice.' The ancient Hetruscans, ordained by a law, that there should be no
statue in their temples. Lucian, de Dea Sgr. writes, '
The ancient temples in Egypt
had no statues! Plutarch, in Numa and Clemens Alexan. Strom. I. remark, 'That
Numa, the second king of Rome, made express orders against the use of images, in the
worship of the Deity? Plutarch adds, '
That for the hrst 170 years after building the
city, the Romans used no
images, but thought the Deity to be invisible.' So to the days
of Silius Ilalicus and Philostratus, at the temple of Hercules, our planter of Britain at
Gades, the old patriarchal method of religion was observed, as
bishop Cumberland '
takes notice.
"
Sed nulla eifigies, simulachra ve nota deorum.'|' And our British Druids had no
images. And whatever we find in history, that looks like idolatry in them, is not to
be referred to the aboriginal Druids, but to the later colonies from the Continent."$
In this last passage I am inclined to think Dr. Stukeley is right.
The old Greek historians say there was a
temple on Hargerizim, (that is Mount
Gerizim,) to Jupiter or Zeus, which had no statue or image. This was the temple ot
Ieo, or Ieue, or Jehovah, established by Joshua, in compliance with the following
command in Deuteronomy :§ When ye be gone over Jordan ye shall set up these stones,
which I command you this Jay, in mount Gerizim, and thou shalt plaister them with
plaistcr. When the word Gilgal, used in another place, is considered, there can be no
doubt that these were a stone circle. This temple was destroyed by the Assyrians,
rebuilt after the captivity, and again destroyed by John Hyrcanus.|[

A SINGLE PLAIN STONE THE ORIGIN OF IDOLATRY.*CHAP. VI. SECT. II 209
How the law of Numa, just now noticed, against images, came to be broken, does not
appear. To the universality of this law the Hindoos are said to present an
exception;
but yet there are not wanting circumstances which may justify a
presumption that India
was not originally polluted by idolatrous practices. Egypt, excessive as was its degra-
dation, had accounts in its ancient histories, that a time had been when idolatry had not
prevailed, and to the very last a considerable district in the upper part of the country
never tolerated it. The persons who are inclined to believe with me in the great prime.
val nation of Baillie, may, perhaps, think they see
grounds to entertain the opinion that
the enlightened nation, the parent of arts and sciences, was too enlightened to bend the
knee to the work of its own hands.
A SINGLE PLAIN STONE THE ORIGIN OF ID0LA'I'RY.1CHA.P. VI. SECT. II.
Throughout all the world the first object of Idolatry seems to have been a
plain,
unwrought stone, placed in the ground, as an emblem of the generative or procreative
powers of nature! In its origin this seems to have been of a
very simple and inoden ive
character, though at last it came to be abused to the grossest and most superstitious
purposes. In all parts of India these kinds of stones are to be found under the name of
Linghams. They are many of them of immense size, and generally stand near some
magnificent temple. I believe there is no instance of any of their temples being found
without them. It is probable that most of them, at least of those that are
very ancient,
were themselves the lirst objects of adoration, and that the temples were built near to
them, as in a
place of peculiar sanctity. In time the idol within the temple might take
away part of the veneration from the pillar, but yet it is always considered with profound
respect and veneration.
They are seldom any part ofthe building of the temple. They are
mostly cones, with
the top shaped into the form of a heart. They are known to be emblems ofthe creative
power. The Tyrians had two near
Tyre, and probably the pillars of Hercules were
stones of this description, set up by the Phcenicians. (See Vignette to this Chapter.)
Arrian, in his Life of Alexander, says,
"
That Gades was built by the Phoanicians.
The form, the sacrifices and ceremonies, there performed, areall after the Phmnician
manner." Strabo says,'|' that there were two pillars here dedicated to Hercules. Si1ius»
speaking of the rites used in the Gaditan temple of Hercules, says, the priests oiiiciated
there bare-footed ;_1_' practised chastity, had no statues, used white-linen surplices, and paid
tithe to Hercules.

THE GRECIAN LITBOI.--CRAP. VI. SECT. III.
The Grecians shewed a
pillar, Lithos or Stela, which was called Amazonian, as it
was supposed, from the Amazons!
To this stone the Amazons were believed to have paid their adoration, as it was im-
agined, before statues were used. Such a one the Argonauts are said have found in the
temple of Arez, when they landed on the coast of Pontus, and made their offerings to the
Deity.1'
Similar Stelae or Lithoi were to be seen at Megara, Cheronea, and Scotussa, and
Cunoscephale, in Thessaly ; also in Ionia, and in Mauritania, and one within the walls
of Athens;
Semiramis is said to have erected an obelisk l25 feet high.§
The greatest oath of the Romans was, per Jovem Lapidem.
Mr. King has observed, that the translation of Homer's Iliad, book xi. l. 4-75, is not
as it is paraphrased by Pope, but as follows, "
Paris shot his arrows, bending behind the
pillar, placed on the tumulus that contained the ashes of Ilus, the son of Dardanus, the
ancient king of Troy." He then goes on to point out the conduct of the Greeks in
sacrificing the Trojan captives at the funeral of Patroclus, over whose ashes they erected
a tumulus ; and as
appears afterward, from Plutarch's Life of Alexander, also erected
on the top of it a stone pillar, which Alexander anointed with oil. He then proceeds to
shew, that fiom the words used by Plumrch and Homer, there is the greatest reason to
believe that tumuli, with pillars on their tops, were erected over the bodies of Achilles,
Hector, and Elpenor. In all these cases the same word er-qaqv is used.||
Cyrus caused pillars to be erected over the graves of Abradates, king of Susa, and his
wife Panthea, and their state officers or eunuchs had each a
pillar set over their graves.
The custom of setting up large stones was
probably carried to excess in Greece, as Plato
and Demetrius Phalereus made laws to regulate the size of them. The pillars of Trajan
and Antoninus are
only remnants of this custom. I apprehend the feeling which caused

Stones of this kind are very common in the Old Testament. The oldest there named
is that set up by Jacob after be had his curious dream.* "
And Jacob rose up early in
the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a
pillar,
and poured oil upon the top of it."

THE LITHO! OR CBOMLEHS OF THE BR!'1'0N8.=CHAP. VI. SECT. Y.
These single stones in the British islands are very common.
They have no known
name unless it be that of Cromleh. To this there is no objection, except that this name
is given also at tim to two others kinds of stones. I shall adopt the Greek words
Lithos and Lithoi.
In order to account for these Lithoi, Cromlehs or Cromleacs, every supposition has
been made, by di&`erent inquiring philosophers, which human ingenuitycould devise. It
is only necessary to notice that which seems to be the most probable. Mr. Toland
explains the word Cromleac, from the Irish cram, to adore, and leac stone-stone of
adoration. But Crom was one of the Irish names of God. Daghda was called Crom-
eocha, the good Crom; Crom cruadh or Crom cruach, was the name of an idol cele-
brated in Ireland ;' and, in line, in ancient Irish the name of a priest was Cromer or
Cruimthear, that is, servant or adorer of Crom. Then Cromleac may mean the stone of
Crom, or ofthe Supreme God. The Cromleac is also called Bothal, from the Irish Batk,
a house and aL or Alla/I God.1' This is evidently the hat-n'|:, bit-al or Bethel, or house
of God of the Hebrews. This name is inscribed upon a Cromleac in the cavern at New
Grange, in Ireland, where the most ancient inscriptions are to be found. (See Plates 19,
20, 21.) The Cromleac was also called indeaéha, which M. Pictet explains by xim-
dealbha, the image or
symbol of Ion, the God Supreme. The word Ion is curious,
with reference to what we have seen ofthe Island of Iona. Cromleacs are of three kinds,
the single Lithos, or upright stone or pillar, the same with a
cross-piece on the top, and
athird, consisting of two
upright stones fixed in the ground, with a third at the top.
Why should not these have been figurative .of the ancient Triad? To distinguish the
latter, they have been called trilithons. Theyare often much too lofty to have been
any thing of the altar kind, and are
generally ofvery large, unwrought stones.
The Trillthons are found in India, on the coast of Malabar.
CROSSES UPON' THE I»I'|.'HOI._°CHAP. YI. SECT. VI.
In a
village, called Men-perhen, in the parish of Constantine, in Comwall, in Borlase's
time, there stood a
pyramidal stone twenty-four feet in length.; It was worked up by a
farmer into above twenty gate-posts. Long after the introduction of Christianity the
populace continued to pay adoration to Lithoi, as is proved by the decrees of councils to
prohibit it. Dr. Borlase says,
"
In Ireland some of these stones-erect have crosses cut
upon th , which are
supposed to have been done by Christians, out of compliance with

the Dmid prejudices; that when Druidism fell before the Gospel, the common people,
who were not easily to be weaned from their superstitious reverence for these stones,
might pay a kind of justifiable adoration to them when thus appropriated to the uses of
Christian memorials, by the sign of the cross. There are still some remains ofadolation
paid to such stones in the Scottish Western isles, even
by the Christians. As it seems
to me, they call them bowing-stones, from the reverence shewn them: for the Even
Maschith, which the Jews were forbid to worship# signifies really a
bowing-stone, and
was doubtless so called, because worshiped by' the Canaanites. In the isle of Baray
there is one stone, about seven feet high, and when the inhabitants come near it, they
take a religious turn round it, according to the ancient Druid custom."1' This was
called the Deisol, of which I shall treat hereafter.
By the Council of Lateran, in 452, the adoration of stones in ruinosis Ioczlr et
sylues-
fribus was
strictly forbidden. By many councils afterward, a
prohibition of this kind
of superstition was repeated. And by the Council of Paris, in 1672, all these places
were ordered to be destroyed, which proves their former existence, and accounts for their
prment scarcity in France.
I very much question whether the crosses were cut on these stones by Christians. I
think if they had adopted this practice, they would not have prohibited them by decrees
of councils. And I think it appears that the crosses on
many of the stone: must have
been an original and integral part of them, and not formed afterward. In my chapter on
the cross, I have shewn that the cross is no exclusive emblem of Christian worship.
Under all the circumstances I think nothing certain can be deduced from these stones
having the crosses.; The question must remain in doubt, but it is of little importance.
THE DIFFERENT USES 09 THESE STONES.-CRAP. VI. SECT. VII.
Many persons have thought that all these different kinds of monuments were
sepul-
chral, and they draw this inference because the remains of human bodies are sometimes
found near them. If this be admitted, it will prove at once that St. Paul's and West-
minster Abbey are so too. One, of course, will be the monument of Lord Nelson, and
the other of the kings of England. There can be no doubt that the places were used as
cemeteries on account of their supposed sanctity, precisely as our churchyards are at this
day. The precincts of these monuments were holy ground: and it is probable that the
practice of burying in our churchyards was derived from this very custom. If Grotius
may be believed, this is not the only thing copied fiom the Druids, by our priests.
"
Infinite appropriations to various uses have been made of stone circles, or stones:

214° THE DIFFERENT USES OF THESE STONES.-CHAP. VI. SECT. VII.
but we need only refer to patriarchal ages to shew that it was
customary to erect stones
upon memorial occasions; that among Heathens they were consecrated and worshiped
by travellers; that a stone, called the Mother of the Gods, was
brought from Asia to
Rome; and that large pillars of rude stone, perpendicularly erected, either separately or
joined with others, in squares and circles, of which some are
placed as supporters, or
flat stones, of a. surprising magnitude, either in an inclined or horizontal position, are of
Canaanitish or Phoenician origin."
They were no doubt often sepulchral: thus was the pillar set up by Jacob over the
grave of Rachel.'|° Sometimes they were, when intended for this object, placed on tu-
muli. Ilus, the son of Dardanus, king of Troy, was buried in this manner, in the plain
before that city.¢ When Sarpedon was killed in battle, Jupiter desired Apollo to send
his wounded body, washed, anointed with ambrosia, and clothed with never-fading vas-
tures, to his native country, there with due honours to be deposited by his friends and
relations, þÿTu{.¢. ¬m-re

'yup ycpag eg: Savailawz an evident sign that this was the
most honourable way of burying, as being what Jupiter himself ordered for his favourite
son.§
They were also often set up as trophies of victories. Thus was that set up by Samuel
between Mizpeh and Shen, in commemoration of his defeat of the Philistines. The
Swedes and Danes have many of these: and in Scotland, in the shire of Murray, there
is a
single stone set up as a monument of the fight between king Malcolm, son of Keneth,
and Sueno the Dane. The Trajan and Antonine columns are imitations of this ancient
custom; but I am of opinion that all these are confined to the monolithoi or single
stones. All the complex monuments are
religious.
There were probably some of these~stones which were set up as witnesses to covenants
of peace, like that of Jacob and Laban: many as
boundary stones; but like the crosses
of the Roman church, they were always, after they were once set up, looked upon with
a certain degree of religious reverence. They became sacred stones. They were in this
like the termini of the Romans. The monument of Laban and Jacob was an emblem
of acivil pact, but it became afterward the place of worship of the whole twelve tribes of
Israel.
In the 2d book of KingS,|| it is said that they set them up images in groves, in every
high hill, and under every green tree. The Hebrew word used here for image is HJYD
mtzbe, Matzebah, which means a rude plain pillar, without any eliigy, the same as those of
Jacob and Rachel and Absalom were, the same word Matzebah being used in them all.1|`

the porch of the temple :-and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof
Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."~|'
The first sacred places of the Israelites were evidently their single stones, or stone
circles. Alter a time these were succeeded by the temples on Gerizim and Jerusalem.
The history ot' this change we know from the Bible. The temples of the Gentiles were
exactly the same in every particular. A rude stone, as an emblem oi' the Creative
Power or the Creator, and the site ot' it surrounded with oaks, and called the Bit-al, or
house of God, was the origin probably of all the very ancient temples. The only differ.
ence in this respect between the temple at Jerusalem and of Diana at
Ephesus is, that
we know the origin and history of the former, but not ofthe latter.
After the many striking traits of similarity, it is not surprising, if the Britons were a
Phcenician colony, that these Aidan, Lithoi, should be found amongst them. Accordingly
we find them exactly like the Hindoo lithoi, ot' very great size and length, forming no
part of the temple, but standing alone near it. It is not unlikely that many may have
been votive offerings, like that of Jacob, which was
clearly of this nature. So were often
the crosses of the Romanists, and it is probable that these crosses had their origin li°om
those very stones. They have both nearly the same
figurative meaning, coming at
last to denote eternal lyk. These monolithoi must be carefiilly distinguished from another
kind of stone monuments called Cams.
Stones of this kind are so
very common in Ireland and Scotland, as to make it unne-
cessary to give a
description of more than the most remarkable of them. They are also
very common in Denmark, Sweden, and the other northern countries. It is now become
impossible to distinguish which were set up as monumental stones only, from such as,
like that set up by Jacob at Bethel, were
correctly and solely objects of adoration. The
difliculty is increased by the custom of burying near these sacred stones, which generally
prevailed, as it now prevails near our churches. Wherever I meet with a stone of this
kind within the inclosure or outworks of one of the circular temples, and not
standing in
any of the circular lines, I suspect it is sepulchral; but where it is in the centre ofthe
circle, or in a remarkable place of the circle, as for instance, the odd stone at the back ot'
the altar at Stonehenge, I suspect it is a
Lingham or lithos: again, where I find that one

2l6 ROCK IDOLS.=CHAP. VI. SECT. VIII.
or two stones stand out of the circles, as at Stonehenge, but that they are necessary to
make up the number of stones to be equal to some well-known cycle, or astronomical
period, and that they do make up such period or cycle, I then suspect that they are not
monumental.
In Plates 24- and 25, the reader will see two examples of what are called fire towers,
in Ireland and Scotland. Towers of the same kind have been observed in Bulgaria.
The object for which they were built has set all antiquarians at defiance. It has lately
occurred to me, that they may have been similar to the Lithoi of the ancients. Like
those of the Hindoos, they are almost always near a church or monastery, but very
seldom fonn a part of it. The shape of all of them is very similar. May they not have
been built in part by the early Druids, and in part by Druids Christianized-by Curbs-
under the influence of the same principle which caused the signs of the Zodiac to be
worked in high-relief on the front of the church of Notre-Dame at Paris, and also on the
porch of one of the churches in York-under the influence of the same principle which
continued to operate in placing or in continuing certain moveable globes in the church
of I-com-kill, which I shall presently describe? They seem to have been so useless for
the common purposes of life, so very expensive, and so general, that I have great difli-
culty in attributing them to any thing but religion. The crucified Saviour on two of
them raises no objection to this, on the principle which I have just now stated. If I
be right in this conjecture, part may have been built before the time of Christ, part since.
We know that Christians did mix the Druid rites with those of Christianity, from the
circumstance that various councils and synods issued decrees to prohibit the practice.
I believe there are nearly Bfty of these stones still remaining in diH`erent parts of Ireland,
some as much as ninety feet high. They are all nearly alike: when the reader sees one,
he may be said to have seen all.
Mr. Toland notices three large stones on the brink of Loch-Hacket in the county of
Clare, on which were inscribed the names of Christ in three languages; Jesus in Hebrew,
on the iirst; Safer in Greek, on the second; and Sala-afar in Latin, on the third; which
Toland says were reported to have been inscribed by St. Patrick. Here is an example
ofthe Pagan lithoi ing-rafted into Christianity.
ROCK IDOLS.-'CHAIR VI. SECT. VIII.
Besides these stones, which were evidently set up by human machinery, the Druids
also took advantage of natural rocks, and cut diem into pillars as they stood, working
away the stones till they often reduced them to stand almost on a
point; such is the
Wring-Cheese, Plate 32, in the parish of St. Clare, in Cornwall. On the top ofthis
was a rocking~stone. Such is also the stone in Plate 85, Fig. 6, at Brimham Craggs,

in Yorkshire. This stone, it is said, had formerly a
rocking-stone on the top of it,
which some years ago fell from its place, and being after its fall in a
position leaning
against the pillar, the present owner, Lord Grantley, had it carefully removed, as it en-
dangered the pillar.

There is also another ancient monument, to which, perhaps, more than to any other,
the name of Cromle/z is appropriated. It generally consists of four stones, three upright
and one imposed. See Plate 26, and Vignettes Chapters I. II. III. and V. This
last is often of immense size. Some persons have thought them altars, but they are
often from their great height totally un'dt for any thing of the kind. These are sometimes
in the Welsh language' called Kist-vaens, or stone-chests. See Plates 16, 17, 18.
Bumt bones and ashes are frequently found near them, or placed under them in oblong
chambers. These circumstances prove that they have been sepulchral monuments, at
which sacrifices have been performed, which we know was a
practice very common with
the ancients. Kitt's Cotty-House in the Vignette to Chapter III., Lanyon Cromleh,
Plate 26, and the Ki
` '
stvaen in Clatford Bottom, Plate 18, are examples of this kind of
monument.
They are often called in Cornwall, Quoits. In Merionethshire, in Wales, there is one
which is called Koeten-Arthur, or Quoit Arthur; another in Carnarvonshire is called

C 'th that is the Sun's-house They are found almost all over the world, but
Carig- roi , ,

mostly where the Celtae or Druids are Imaam to have been. They are often found in the
inside of stone circles or temples, and often at the side of them, precisely as our monu-
ments are in our churches, and in our churchyards, and often where there does not appear
to have ever been any edifice near them.
From their being destitute of every thing like inscription, or of an appearance of having
been either tamata or
perdolata ferro, I think they are not only Druidlcal sepulchral
monuments, but very early ones. But sepulchral, I think they certainly are.
S eak' of these edifices, Dr. Borlase'|' says,
"

mounds, or hillocks of earth, round the supporters, in order to get the covering-stone the
easier into its place, or by what engines, it is in vain for us to inquire; but what is most
surprising is, that this rude monument of four or five stones is so artfully made, and the
huge incumbent stone so geometrically placed, that though these monuments greatly
exceed the Christian aera (in all probability), yet it is very rare to find them give way to
time, storm, or weight; nay, we find the covering-stone often gone, that is, taken down
for building, and yet the supporters still keeping their proper station."
These Cromlehs are often found upon the tops of tumuli. Dr. Borlase has observed,
that this is a circumstance not a little confirmatory of their being tombs.
They are also often surrounded with barrows or tumuli. This seems to be what
might reasonably have been expected. After a
great chieltain or Druid had been inter-
red under one of these very expensive monuments, the ground in its immediate neigh-
bourhood would naturally acquire a species of sacred character, even if this were not
given to it by some ceremonies which would probably be performed. A Saxon chief is
said to have been buried near Kitt's-Cotty House, in Kent. Nothing is more likely.
If a chief died or was killed in Scotland near one of their very numerous cemeteries, which
are remote from churches, he might very readily be carried to one of them to be buried.
For the same reason the Saxon prince might be buried near to the ancient cemetery.
Kqysler gives an account of the sepulchre of the Saxon king Harold, and it appears to
have been correctly a Kistvaen. Such of them, of which there are
many in Germany, as
were the works of Saxons or Danes, or any others about the time of Caesar, would probably
have Runic inscriptions, which would be wanting on such as were more ancient.

The next kind of monuments we shall notice, are called Cams. They are, in fact,
great heaps of stones raised on the top of natural hills and often of artificial tumuli.
What are commonly called Carns, are, in the Welsh language called Karnedde. This
word Rowland# with great probability, derives from the two Hebrew words 'IJ-DP
Km-nd, or Keren Ned/i, i. e. a
coped heap. Mr. Rowland observes, that a pillar is
generally placed near one of these heaps; that this was exactly an imitation of the heap
and pillar of Jacob and Laban. And, as he justly adds, all the circumstances attending
this transaction between Jacob and Laban seem to shew, that there was nothing resorted

(p. 51) asks, "
How should our columns and pillar-stones come to be generally placed nw our heaps, as those

to but the practice of an ancient custom. Jacob called the heap Gal-ead-Laban Iagar
Sakadutha. Now the three words Gal, Iagar, and Cam, are
3ynQnym¢ug_ And 5-gm
the word Iagar, probably came the Latin and English word, Agger a
/leap.
Apollo was called Karnean or Carnéan Kapvmg, perhaps from the Hebrew I-yi; km,
Callimachus, if I mistake not, exhibits one of the usual proofs of the ignorance of the
Greeks in the origin of their religious rites and customs. He considers that Apollo was
called carnean or horned Apollo, from the word Carneus, meaning horned. He says
Apollo built an altar entirely of horns-foundation, sides, and all. It seems absurd
enough to build an altar of horns. The truth was, these carns were a species of altars
on which, amongst the Celtic nations, great fires were made in honour of Apollo, and
thence he got the name of Carnean Apollo. But I believe he never was
represented
with horns. In Canaan there was a town called :'3"|p Iernim, dedigared gg Agfa;-ge gf
Asteroth, n'1nw,V ostrf, with horns,"' and this meant homed; she was represented as a
woman with a bull's head. The Celtic word for a
heap of stones was the same as the
Hebrew word for horned, and one was mistaken for the other.
There was a
great temple in Phuanicia to this goddess. Orpheus, in a
hymn, calls
her bull-horned moon.
The Carnean games 'rm
Kagvena. of the Greeks, were
probably derived from the Celtaef
-from the Carns in honour of Apollo.
Apollo was called Carneus because he was
worshiped at the Carns; as he was called
Delphian because he was
worshiped at Delphi; as
Jupiter was called Olympius because
he was
worshiped at Olympus.
Throughout Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, it was the custom on certain days, gene-
rally the equinoxes and solstices, to light great fires on the tops of the hills, or Karns, in
honour of the God Apollo, or Belus or Belinus. Soracte was one of these mountains in
Italy, sacred to him; and his rites upon it were under the protection of the family of
the Hirpins, which was
probably descended from the ancient Druids, as the Courbs
were in Ireland. But their origin in process oi' time had become forgotten. Like the
Courbs, they inherited great privileges and considerable property. It is impossible to
pass Mount Soracte without being struck with the magnificent Cam which it rnust have
formed. I think I never saw a mountain better calculated for the purpose. I apprehend
all the little artificial Carns were made in imitation of the great ones, by pious devotees.
It is not
unlikely that these little Cams were made adjoining to the Family burying-
places of great men.
In the Gaelic language, Sorach or Sorck is an eminence, and Sorachta means ace:-sand,
Whether this be the origin of the name of the hill Soracte, the reader must
judge for
himselfl

220 CARNS.-'CHAIR VI. SECT. X.
It is stated by Mr. Toland, that it was customary in the Druidical sacrifices for some
person of consequence to take the entrails oi' the sacrificed animal in his hands, and,
walkin barefoot over the coals thrice, after the flames had ceased, to carry them to the
B'
Druid who waited in a whole skin at the altar. If the nobleman escaped harmless, it
'
ed
was reckoned a good omen, welcomed with loud acclarnations; but if he receiv any
h it was deemed unlucky both to the community and to h1msel£ He then goes on
UPG
to say, that he has seen the people running and leaping through the St. John's Eres in
'
ki d f l t
Ireland, and not only proud of passing unsinged; but as if it were some n o us ra-
tion, thinking themselves, in a special manner, blessed by this ceremony, of whose origi-
nal, nevertheless, they were wholly ignorant in their imperfect imitation of it. He
`
`
'
'
l ed
observes, that without being appnzed of all this, no reader, however otherwise earn ,
can trul a rehend the beginning ot' the Consul Flaminius's speech to Equanus the
Y PP
Sabine, at the battle of Thrdgsirnenus, thus intelligibly related by Salsas Italzcus :
Then seeing Equanus, near Soracte born,

He then goes on to observe, that Soracte was in the country of the Umbriaars under
the name qfSa6ines;° that on the top of it were the grove and temple of Apollo, and also

from the trouble and expense of several oilices. They were called Hirpins. Virgil,

A Celtic antiquary, ignorant of the origin of the Umbrians and Sabines, would
imagine, when reading what passed on Soracte, that it was some Gallic, British, or Irish
mountain, the rites being absolutely the same. Mr. Toland then proceeds to
observe,
"
We do not read, indeed, in our Irish books, what preservative against fire was used
by those who ran barefoot over the burning coals ofthe Carns ; and to be sure
they would
have the common
people piously believe that they used none; yet that they really did,
like the celebrated fire-eater in London, men of' penetration and uncorrupted judgment
will never question. But we are not left to our judgments; for the fact is
suiiiciently
attested by that prodigy of knowledge, and perpetual opposer of superstition, Marcus
Var-ro, who as Servius, on the above-cited passage of Virgil, aHirms,* described the very
ointment of which the Hirpins made use, besmearing their feet with it when they walked
through the fire. Thus at all times have the multitude (that common
prey ot' priests
and princes) been easily gulled ;1' swallowing secrets of natural philosophy for divine
miracles, and ready to do the greatest good or hurt, not under the notions of vice or
virtue, but barely as directed by men who find it their interest to deceive them.";
The fires to which allusion was made a little time ago, are
yet continued almost all
over Ireland on the days of the equinoxes and solstices. In Cornwall, and many other
parts of Britain, particularly Cumberland, great fires are
lighted, called bon-fires, on
St. John's Eve, St. Peter's, and Midsummer Eve.§ These practices are nothing but a
continuation of the custom so strongly reprobated in the Old Testament, of passing their
children through the fire to Moloch and Baal, the two identical gods of Ireland. See
Lev. xviii. 21, xx. 22-24; Jer. imii. 85; 2 Kings xxiii. IS. The similarity be-
tween the Syriana and the Irish and British, is so close, that it is absolutely impossible
to have been the e&`ect of accident. The most incredulous must yield to such evidence.||
So late as the year 1786, the custom of lighting fires was continued at the Druid
temple at Biamham, near Harrowgate, Yorkshire, on the eve of the summer solstice. Ot'
this an account is given in the Arcliaeologia Land., by Hayman Rooke, Esq. For this
temple see Plate 85, Eg. 2, a. and description in Introduction, p. lxxii.

Near the famous temple in Oxfordshire, called Rolrich, will be found in the maps a
place called like this, Brammom, or Bramham, or Bramman. No doubt there has been
a similar temple there, which is now all gone.
ROCKING-STONES, OR LOGAN ST0NES.1CHAP. VI. SECT. XI.
Besides these diE`erent kinds of sacred stones, the ancient priests had the art of placing
stones, often of immense size, in so peculiar a manner, that they would move with a
slight touch of the hand; vide Plate 31. Sometimes they were poised on one
point
onl sometimes on two. They seem to have been used in
very ancient times for the
ya
purposes of priestcraft and fraud, and that in different countries. They have been called
Petraa Arnbrosiae, from being anointed in religious ceremonies with the ambrosia of the
'
ts or oil of roses This ceremony Jacob performed at Bethel. They were called
ancxen ,
.
by the Greeks 7.16m Efldllllxbl, or living Stones. They are also called Logan stones, or
rocking-stones.
Stukeley says,
"
the Tyrians had two of these stones near their city." Melcartus, or
the Tyrian Hercules, is said to have ordered Tyre to be built where the Petrie Ambrosim
stood, which were two moveable rocks, standing beside an olive tree. He was to sa-
crifice on them, and they were to become fixed and stable, or rather the city should be
built with happy auspice, and become permanent." In Dr. Stuke1ey's work on Abury
are three medals struck by the city of Tyre, in honour of their illustrious founder, two
t d two
of which are represented in the vignette to this chapter. In the first are represen e
pillars, on the one side an altar, with fire burning, on the other an olive tree: underneath
AMBPOCIE IIETPE: the inscription, Col. Typ. Metr.: in the second Hercules sacri-
ficing on the altar, and two pillars erected near: in the third, an olive tree between two
pillars, and an altar underneath.-|' At Harpava, in Asia, there was a
rocking-stone, of
which Pliny has given an account. He says that it is of so
strange and wondertiil a
nature, that if even a
finger is laid upon it, it will move; but if you thrust it with your
whole body, it will not move at all.;
A stone of this kind was made at Tarentum, by Lycippus. Pliny says,§
"
Such a one
forty cubits high was made at Tarentum, by Lycippus. The wonder of this stone is,
that it is said to be moveable by a touch of the hand, (owing to the particular manner in
which it is poised,) and cannot be moved by the greatest force. Indeed the Workman is
said to have guarded against this by opposing a fixlcrum (prop) at a small distance, where
it was exposed to the blast, and most liable to be broken."||
Pliny also says, that there is a rocking-stone (Lapis fugitivus) in the town of Cyzicum,

which was said to be left there by the Argonauts. This stone was first placed in the
Prytaneum, (a place in the citadel of Athens, where the magistrates and judges held
their rneetings,) and the situation was most appropriate, as it was an appendage of the
Druidical judicial circles; but as this stone wished to return home, and used frequently
to run away from the Plytaneum, it was at last taken to Cyzicum, and fixed down with
lead. Mr. Huddleston* observes, that it was
very ridiculous that the Argonauts were
said to have used this fugitive stone as an anchor. How odd that it should not have
liked to live in the magnificent citadel at Athens! It verifies the old proverb, that home
is home, be it never so
homefy. How odd too, that they should have been obliged to
fasten it, when it got to its long-desired home, with lead! It had a strange rambling
disposition; never content! The Greeks were a wise people! No wonder their wise
men were so celebrated l A learned and ingenious gentleman has maintained, that these
stones are of the nature of the lusus naturae, and also that they are sepulchral monu-
ments, because after Hercules had slain the two sons oi' Boreas, that is, t/re sons
ofthe
North wind, he erected over them two stones, one of which moved to the sonorous breath
f the North wind 1° If my reader should be surprised at Mr. Boreas having sons, let
o _
him look to Virgil, and consider the effect which the West wind had in ancient times
upon the mares of Thrace, and his surprise will cease. I think the gentleman here
all ded to must be a match even for the wisest of the Grecian wiseacres!
ll s
But the most celebrated rocking-stone of the ancients was the Gygoman stone near the
famous Lithoi or Pillars of Hercules, in the Straits of Gibraltar. Ptolemy Hephestion¢
says, it stands near the ocean, that it may be moved with the stalk of an
asphodel, but
'
' ° '
rel Celtic for
cannot be removed by any force. '
It seems this word Gygonlus is pu y ,
G
'
o si ities Mortitans, the Rocking-stone."§
"
In Wales they call it Y Maen sigl,
wing g gn
that is, the shaking-stone. In Cornwall we call it the Logan stone, the meaning of which
I do not understand." 1| On this Mr. Vallencey says,
"
Had Dr. Borlase been ac-
'
ted with the Irish MSS., he would have found, that the Druidioal oracular stone,
quam
called Log/lan, which yet retains its name in Cornwall, is the Irish Logh-onn, or stone
into which the Druids pretended that the Logh, or divine essence descended, when they
consulted it as an oracle." 1[
HOW T0 ACCOUNT FOR THE ROCKING-STONES.-CHAP. YI. SECT. XII.
I think the rocking-stones are found nowhere but where the Celtaa may be certainly
t the ve earliest inhabitants who may be classed about the S3518 date
traced, or amongs ry
with the Celtz, and who probably were Celtae, though it may not bein our power to

prove it. There are none known in Germany, Asia, and Afl'i¢°» at the Pl'8S¢l\f m0lll¢Df»
and we do not read of any having existed after the very early ones. That there are none
in France, Spain, or
Italy, may be accounted for, by the decrees of the Roman Church
to destroythem.
There is, as I conceive, only one way of accounting for many of the
rocking-stones'
which appear to be so far natural as always to have remained in their present situations,
which is, that the Druids had the art of cutting the bottoms away in so
ingenious a
manner as to produce the rocking effect. They were very numerous.
Probably the
greatness of their number, dispersed over the country, would be of use to them in their
frauds. They might say, to prove the truth of any assertion, that any stone, sacred to
Apollo or Iao, having a sacred well, or fountain, or fire, on the top of it, would move in
the event of certain things being true. And the great number of them in such a case as
this would greatly aid their deception; for if there were only one in Cornwall, roguery
might be suspected of it, when the suspicion might be removed by the same
things hap-
pening in Wales or Yorkshire.
ROCKING-STONES COMMON IN BRITAIN.-°Cl1AP. YI. SECT. XIII.
These Stones are very common in Britain. It is known that formerly there were
several in the island of Iona, for which the natives had a
great reverence, and on that ac-
count they were thrown into the sea. At Bramham or Brimmon, in Yorkshire, are live.
In Cornwall there are several. Some of these stones have been ascertained byactual ex-
amination, when they have been overthrown, to have been constructed by art, and placed
in their present situations. Others must have been made to have the rocking quality by
cutting away the stones from under them, so as to produce the efect; as
they never
could have been elevated to
their present height. Nar Penzance, in Cornwall, is a
very
large stone of this kind called Main Ambre, which was thrown down by Cromwell's
soldiers. The similarity of the name to the Petra Ambrosia of Tyre, is very striking.
The natives explain the words Main Ambre, to mean the stone of Ambrosius. I think
the explanation which I have given from the anointing will be more
satisfactory. Sir
Robert Sibbald* naming a stone of this kind in Scotland, near Belvaird, in Fife, says,
"
I
am informed that this stone was broken by Cromwell's soldiers. And it was discovered
then, that its motion was performed by a
yolk extuberant in the middle of the under
surliace of the uppermost stone, which was inserted in a cavity in the surface of the lower
stone."'\'

In the Highlands of Scotland the rocking-stones are called Claca Breath, i. e. stones
of judgment. This seems to raise a reasonable ground of belief, that they were used to
extort truth in judicial proceedings. Mr. Huddlestone is mistaken when he says they
are not found together; several may be seen together at Bramham rocks, near Knares-
borough, in Yorkshire, to which I have just referred.
In the island of Ilachann, one of the Garveloch isles of the Hebrides, is one of the
Clachan-braths. The celebrated geologist, Dr. Macculloch says, "Every visitor thinks
himself bound to contribute his elforts towards its destruction, by moving it, to wear it
away, and with it that of the '
great globe itself? whose existence is to terminate, at
the same period, with this stone." ""
There is a remarkable rocking-stone in the parish of Kilbarchan, another in the par-
ish of Kelis, in Galloway, one in Kirkmichael, in Perthshire, another at Balvaird, and
a third at Dron.'|'
TOLMEN.-CHAP. VI. SECT. XIV.
There is another kind of stone deity in Cornwall, which Mr. Borlase says, has never
before been taken notice of by any author. Its common name is Tolmen ; that is, the
Hole of Stone. (See Plate SO.) These stones are so placed as to have a hole under them,
through which devotees passed for religious purposes. There is one of the same kind in
Ireland, called St. Declan's stone. In the mass of rocks at Bramham Craggs there is a
place made or used for devotees to pass through, in the Druids' cave. And we read in
the accounts of Hindostan, that there is a very celebrated place in Upper India, to which
immense numbers of pilgrims go, to pass through a place in the mountains called the
cow's belly; after doing which, they are
probably considered to be regenerated, born
again.
In the island of Bombay, about two miles from the town, rises a considerable hill,
called Malabar-Hill, which, stretching into-the ocean by its projection, forms a kind of
int of this hill, on the descent towards the sea-shore,
there is a rock, upon the surface of which there is a natural crevice, which communicates
with a cavity opening below, and terminates towards the sea.
"
This place," says an
author, to whose printed account of it I was referred for corroborative evidence of its
existence,
"
is used by the Gentoos as a
purification for their sins, which, they say,

But there was one more kind of Stones which the ancients wors
iped, w ic. must
not go unnoticed; they were said to have fallen from Heaven; these were
undoubtedly
Aerolites. The famous stone called p.u8pog, mentioned by Dr. Hyde, was
probably one
of these. Arnobius, (contra Gent.,) names a shapeless stone of the Arabians which they
worshiped. The statue of the Thespian God was a rough unhewn stone.1' _
TUMULI AND DWARFY STONE.-CRAP. VI. SECT. XV.
In this work, I take very little notice of tumuli, although it is a branch of the subject
of verv great extent. But it is so natural, in a rude state of society, and after battles, to
raise heaps of earth over the graves of the deceased, that they almost always fail to
give any satisfactory proofs of any thing relating to very early times: for it always has
turned out, that their contents may have been the deposit of later years. Even the Celts
and Hint-heads prove nothing, particularly the former, since they have been found in the
ruins of Herculaneum; and the latter, since Mr. King has noticed that they have been
found in the 'field of Marathon, can hardly be considered in any other light than as amu-
lets or talismans-for surely both iron and steel were well known at the time of that
famous battle. See Plate 27, Fig. i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. Only the two marked
i. ii. are of the full size.
But the tumulus over the cave at New Grange is very different from most others. It
is evidently the work of the primeval race, whatever might be their name. It is the very
portrait of one described by Pausanias, at Mycenae in the Peloponnesus, and for the notice
of which I am indebted to my learned young friend, Mncxmzzra Bevnnnav, the author
of Jubal, lately published. In a letter to me he says,
"
Mycene was
destroyed by the
Argians shortly after the great Persian invasion. On the outside of the old Cyclopian walls
of that town (for the modern ones were destroyed by the Argians) is an immense tumulus,
carn, or barrow. The entrance into this tumulus has a druidical door, which has excited
the curiosity of all travellers.
"The lintel, or top of the door, is one enormous mass of Brescia marble, twenty-seven
feet long, seventeen wide, and four feet seven inches thick. The door-posts are each ot
*

one mass, but the width of the door is only ten feet, so that the lintel projects over them
lar into the barrow. The inside of the tumulus is a circular chamber of stone, like a
bee-hive. Each stone is of huge proportions. The diameter of the chamber is fifty
feet ; the height fifty-one feet. This chamber is formed by horizontal not radiated layers,
which advance over each other; and, having the lower angle cut oil; give the structure
the appearance of a
gothic dome. This I take to be a most important point in its his-
tory, shewing its very great antiquity. The whole of this chamber has been covered
with plates of bronze, some of which remain to this day, fastened to the stones by
bronze pins. The blocks are all parallelograms, and are laid without cement.
"
In the Acropolis of Mycenm is a
Cyclopean gate, called the gate of the Lions; it
remains to this day precisely as described by Pausanias. It bears a
strong resemblance
in structure to the barrow-door just described. The lintel is fifteen feet long, of one
block of Brescia; but the breadth of the door is only nine feet; so that of course the
lintel projects over the door-posts; the height of the door is seventeen feet. Over the
lintel is a
triangular stone slab, eleven feet broad, nine feet high, and two feet thick.
This slab represents, in sculpture in half relief; an indistinct column between two
Egyptian lions. (The travellers, Dodwell, Clark, and others, say, that this door is built
exactly like the remains of Stonehenge: of these blocks, Clark remarks it particularly.)
The column is said to have had a flame on the top of it. Clark and others wish to con-
vert these lions into panthers, and dedicate them to Bacchus, but this is all wrong, for
Pausanias calls them mwrag.
"
This barrow described above is commonly called the treasury of Atreus, but this the
learned reject, and rightly, making it vastly before Atreus. All the stones, both in the
barrow and gate, are of the rough sort, that is, never finished 06; just cut into shape, but
nothing more; in short, they are Druidical. But to have any emblems or
figures, is a
step in refinement which our Druids do not know oi;-at least, I suppose so.
"
Strabo tells us, that Mycenae was built by Perseus, i. e. more than 1000 years before
Christ, or, in other words, in those fabulous times when the Cyclops or Celts were
sup-
ed to be at work. He also says, that the smallest stone in the walls of Mycene could
not be moved by a
waggon and two mules."
This is, no doubt, a very curious tumulus. The style of the arch, the Lithos in half
relief; and the Cyclopean walls, prove its extreme antiquity. And the tradition relating
kn t th G k 'n lact,
to their fabulous Perseus, proves its date to be totally un own o e ree s-i
before the date of their histories. To whom but to the founders of their oracles can it
be attributed-the ancient Celtae?
The form of the dome does not necessarily bespeak such great antiquity as I supposed
when, in a former section,I asked if Mr. Wilkins had forgotten the tunnel at Albano,
POS
and the Cloaca Maxima. I examined both these with a view to the antiquity of the
bee 'd
arch, and I thought they were conclusive. But since Ihave seen what has n sal

Mr. Toland'° and Dr. Wallace have given an accoun o a

No other stones are near it. It is hollowed out within, and at each end is a b an
pillow worked out in the stone, each capable of holding two persons. At the top, about
the middle, is a round hole to admit light and let the smoke escape. It has a hole at the
side about two feet square to admit its inhabitants ; and a square stone lies near it, which
seems to have served the purpose ofa door. This is a curious stone, but it is rendered
more so
by the following observation of Mr. Toland's: "
Herodotus says, in the second
book of his history, that near to the entry of the magnificent temple of Minerva at Sais,
in Egypt, (of which he speaks with admiration,) he saw an edifice 21 cubits in length, 14
in breadth, and 8 in height, the whole consisting only of one stone: and that it was
brought thither by sea, from a place about 20 days' sailing from Sais." It seems not
improbable that these stones may have been for the same religious purpose. But what
that may be, or whether Druidical or not, no one can say.
t f curious stone in the island
'DEISUL OB DEISEAL.-CRAP. VI. SECT. XVI.
The turn round the stone to which allusion was made in a former section, is called the
Deisul or Deiseal. Of this Mr. Martin says,
"
In the Scottish isles, the vulgarnever
come to the ancient sacrificing and fire-hallowing carns, but they walk three times round
them from East to West, according to the course of the sun. This sanctified tour or
round by the South, is called Deiseal, from Deas or Dess, the right hand: and soil or sul,
the sun; the right hand being ever next the heap, or earn. The contrary turn from right
to left by the North, when the body faces the East, was (also used by the Druids, and)
called Tunphol, i. e. sinistrorsum: the Protestants as well as the Romanists are addicted
to the Deisul."~|' When the turn is taken sun-ways, it is intended to do honour to a per.
son, or to invoke blessings on him, or
blessings generally. But when it is taken the
contrary way, it is meant as an imprecation, and to invoke curses for some particular
purpose.
This custom was common both to the Greeks and Romans, and was considered as of
the first consequence. It was expressly ordered by Numa: "
Circumagas te, dum Deos

adoras; sedeas, cum adoraveris."* A particular account of this amongst the Greeks, is
given by Potter, in his- Antiguities.~|° Athenaaus informs us, out of Posidonius, that the
Gauls always turned to the right hand in worshiping. Mr. Tgland observes, This must
have been three thousand years ago; These turns were much practised in all magical
rites and incantations. Different persons have different opinions respecting the origin
of the practice, but they are all founded on surmise; nothing certain is known, I
am inclined to suspect that the procession of the Roman church has originally sprung
irom the same source, like multitudes of their other rites and ceremonies, of the real
origin ol' which they are
totally ignorant.
GROVES.-CRAP. VI. SECT. XVII.
Almost all the stones of which we read in the Old Testament, are stated to have been
set up under an oak or in a
grove.
We read that Abraham planted a grove at
Beersheba,§ where he invoked the Everlast-
ing God, in the name
9/'Je-hovah. Isaac himself afterward invoked the name of Jehovah
in the same place.|| Joshua set up a great stone under an oak by the sanctuary of the
Lord.1[ Among the trees of which their groves consisted, the oak was in a
very par.
ticular manner
preferred, as is evident from various passages of Genesis. Groves were
often places dedicated to religious rites amongst the Greeks and Romans. Virgil never
mentions a
grove without a note of religion." And Strabo says, the poets call temples
by the name of groves; which Dr. Stukeley says was often done in Scripture. Pausa-
nias makes a
particular remark'|'|' of the grove of Diana Servatrix. A grove is named in
the Odyssey; perfectly round. These groves were kept by priests who dwelt there for
that purpose.§§
It is evident from Tacitus, |U| that the temples of the Druids in Anglesey were in
oaken groves. Bramham in Yorkshire, was an immense forest of oak. Trees are ohen
dug up in the peat masses in its neighbourhood.
Edward, earl of Cornwall, granted the mood qfBrz'm/iam to the monks of Fountains,
with leave to inclose it.1|`1|'
The circumstances of similiarity between the veneration for the oak of the Patriarchs
and our Druids, may well justify the learned Dickenson, as Mr. Rowland calls him, in
exclaiming--En primos Sacerdotes Quernos! En Patriarchas Druidas!

curious and magnificent of them all, are to be found in Wiltshire. Wit t e

of Carnac, in France, in no country is there any thing to compare with what Stonehenge
and Abury have been.
In the description in the Introduction I flatter mys
sary to give to my reader as clear an account of them as, by words and prints, is possible.
'

d t b-
Some years ago, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., to whom the public is un er grea o
ligation for the money he has laid out to perpetuate the antiquities of his country, was
D
at great ex ense and trouble to examine the statements of Dr. Stukeley respecting these
an P
monuments, which, with some trifling exceptions, he found to be correct. Stonehenge
stands on an extensive range of downs in Wiltshire, called Salisbury Plain, in a line
t f th ntr
commanding situation, o nnearlythe highest ground in that par o e cou y.
It is not far from the towns of Old Sarurn, and Salisbury or New Sarum, and Wilton.
Sarum is a Hebrew word, www srun, and has the meaning of Planities pascuosissima,
famous for its plains. From this it may, perhaps, be inferred, that Salisbury Plain has
never been covered with wood.'
Stukeley observes, that near the union of three rivers are three cities and three cathe-
elf all will be found that is neces.

The last I translate thus: '
To the infernal Gods. C. Calptnnitts, an accepted priat of the Geddes Sulis,
lived 75 years. His wife, Trifosa Thnzpta, ereded this.'
"
These inscriptions are on altara in the hall of the Bath Institute. The quation is, who was the Goddess Sulif.
She is evidently a British Deity adopted by Romans. The Goddess '
Suliminerum' is a union of Sulis and Minerva.
The Romans found Sulis, and, in their liberal way, instead ofpersecuting her, and excluding her by tat: and articles,
they tacked herto Minerva, the orthodox. It is th clear that Sulis, with the British, had similar attribute to Minerva.
She was the pezsonilication of Wisdom. She must be of Druidical times. These altars were lbund in Bath, in a
garden, and there are more inscriptions alluding to Sulis.
"
Sulis was thus worshiped by Britons and Romans at Bath. I think Sulis-bury is Salisbury, or the town of the
Goddess Sulis.-The word Sulis is quite unknown in clasical thecgony."
Probably the first town was Santn of the Fhoznicians. The second Salis-abiri of the Romans. The word Salis
prefixed to the word Abiri, (the Cabiri, explained in Chapter V. Section XX. XXI.,) as at Bath it was prehxed to
the wonrl Minerva.

triangle, whose sides are less than three miles-Wilton, Old and New
Sarum. The rivers are the Nadre, the C/lilmark, and the Wil{y. Neg fag distant is 3,
ditch, called Chiltern, which seems to be the division ofthe hundreds) The word Chil.
tern, I suppose, comes from the British word Cil or EL and the ancient Celgig wgrd
Trithen, and ought to be called Chiltren-the hundreds ofthe threechurches, or kils.
And a few miles from Stonehenge stands the temple of Abury, the description of
which I suppose the reader has perused in the Introduction. It may be
correctly de.
scribed as a.
hill-temple or altar, as the waters there divide and run to different sides of
the island.'|'
Around these temples are great numbers of tumuli or barrows. The word barrow is
the same as tumulus, a
heap of earth piled up, as a monument, over the body of a pei-sen
deceased. It is a Hebrew word, .V'|"|-182 Bar-mo, and signifies the thrown up pit of
commination or lamentation.¢ I do not understand the derivation of the word tumulus,
but I suspect it is modern Latin.
Stonehenge has gone by various names.
By the ancient Welsh it was called Choir
Gaur.
The meaning of the word Choir, is well known in English, as the most sacred
part of our churches. The word Gaur is Hebrew, 11,1 gur, and means a
eengregatign
or collection of people. The Monks Oflen Called it Chorea Gigantum-the Dance of
the Giants.
111-Jn lag-gur, chagaur, signihes assembling the people to the dance. The Britains
would call it chwarae.
It is also called Stonehenge, and was supposed by some persons to have been erected
by Hengist, the Saxon, to the honour of the Britains whom he murdered at a feast. This
is foolish enough.
Stonehenge may come from Stan or Tau, the district or
territory, and Aonge, mag-1.
cians or sorcerers, in Irish. If such a word as
Hengist did exist, it was
probably a cor.
ruption of the word Aonge. In the oracle near Drogheda, the word Aongus is inscribed
for Sorcerer.§ It must be recollected that Magician in ancient times was not a term of
reproach.
But the old monkish historians tell us, that the temple of Stonehenge was called
Ambres.
This I take to have been its true name. On this Stukeley says,
"
I have taken notice
of another remarkable particular, as to the name of Stonehenge, which I apprehend to
be of highest antiquity, that it was called the Ambres, or Ambrose, as the famous Main

Ambre, by Penzance, in Cornwall, another work of the Druids akin to this. And from
°
32|
hence the adjacent town of Ambres-bury had its name.
_ _
Some of the monkish historians say that the British nobility were treacherously slain
by the Saxon Hengist, at Ambresbury. Some say the act was done ad Pagum Ambrl,
others call it Coenobium Ambrii, others ad Montem Ambrii. The famous rocking-
stone in Cornwall, destroyed by Cromwell, was called Main Ambre, which in the Celtic
language means anointed stone. Main Ambre is Lapis Ambrosius, or Petra Ambrosia,1'
the same as the Petra Ambrosia on the coins of Tyre; Stukeley then observes, that
the arnbrosia was the oil of roses, with which these stones were anointed, as Jacob
anointed his pillow. A Aida; was placed near the temple of Delphi, which was
daily
anointed with oil,§ a
practice still continued to the Linghams in India.||
When the incidental manner in which these monkish writers speak of Stonehenge as
Ambres, is considered, it is impossible to doubt that it went by that name; and when
the circumstances are considered of the stones, (see vignette of medals, Chapter VI.,)
Ambrosia, at Tyre, and the Main Ambres of Cornwall, named before in this chapter,
how is it possible for any one to doubt that they are of the same nature ?1]'

Dr. Borlase** has justly observed,
"
that the idea of Stonehenge being a Roman work,
is not worth refuting. Yet it may be as well to say a few words upon this subject.
The Roman ways cross and mangle these circles; and it can never be true that the
Romans would erect and disiigure the same, and their own, works. It is also evident,
that such monuments were prior to the Roman ways, for the Druids would never be
suH`ered to impede the highways of their lords and masters; therefore, these must have
been built before the Roman ways were made. This will naturally lmd us to another
conclusion equally evident, which is, that as
they could not be Roman works, because

CIRCULAR TEMPLES OF THE ISRAEI.I'1°ES.*CHAP. YI. SECT. XX
In my etymological inquiries, I am in general jealous of myself lest I should give
way too much to imagination, the great fault ofetymologists. I am, therefore, always re.
joiced when I find I am supported by Lexicographers, who can have no theory to indulge.
I was on this account very much pleased when I found myself thus supported by Dr,
Parkhurst, in the following curious proof; that the Israelites followed the practice of our
Druidical ancestors in putting up the stones which they used in their religious rites in
the form of circles. It is written in Exodus xxiv. 4-, And Moses rose up early in the
morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve
tribes of Israel.
Here the stones are evidently twelve in number, independently of the altar. In Deut.
xxvii. 2, it is written,
And it shall be, on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the
Loan thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them
with plaister.
8. And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law.
4-. ...... Ye shall set up these stones, which Icommand you this day, in Mount
Ehal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.
5. And there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lonn thy God, an altar of stones;
thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.
6. Thou shalt build the altar of the Loan thy God of whole stones.
Joshua iv. 9, And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan.
Ver. 19, And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month,
and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
20, And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in
Gilgal.
Here we have repeated insmnc of twelve pillars of unhewn -stones being set up, and
also of an altar at the same time. Here is the practice of using unhewn stones, and of
la' t rin them Now were
they placed in circles or were
they not? Although the
is e g .
srriterof the book of Joshua, writing many years after the time when the stones were set
up, speaks very familiarly of the place Gilgal as of a place well-known; it by no means
follows that it was called Gilgal when Joshua set up the stones. It probably had not
then this name, but acquired it afteward from the circumstance of the

there. This I infer from the name Gllgal, |1151 g@'1. On this, Par urs says g
2 5
234- crncvun Tamar.;-:s os run rsnasnrrss.-cuar. rv. szcr. xx.
roundish heap of stones; and Cruden, in his Concordance, calls it a wheel, a revolution.
Parkhurst says, in another place, '71J gil denotes a revolutaim. This is the same as the
Celtic Ceal or Cil-the G, the third letter of the Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek, denoting
3, becoming changed for C, the third letter of the Latin, &:c., and always in old time
pronounced K, as in Caesar-Kaisar in German. The Mazorltes for the supplied vowel
in the word g{gl give the i; then it is gi{g1. This shews the tradition in their day.
From these stones, the place became called the place of the stone circle. Joshua uses
the term Gilgal proleptically! From this came the names of our
parishes, which were
called from places of Druidical worship Cils or Ceals, thus-Kilpatrick, Kilkenny,
Kildare, (that is literally the Kil of the grove) &c., &c. Almost always where these towns
or parishes have the name of Kil, remains or traditions relating to the Druids are to be
found. Mr. Huddleston observes, that the space which surrounded the mount of the
temple at Jerusalem, in no material circumstance diifered from the Gaelic Cil, which
denoted the circle inclosing the temples of the Druids. From all these circumstances, I
think there can be no doubt that Moses at Sinai, and Joshua at
Gilgal, set up their
twelve stones in the shape of circles.
I have little or no doubt that the temple established by Joshua, as described in the
27th chapter and 4th verse of Deuteronomy, and in the 8th chapter and 30th verse of
Joshua, was the temple of Iam without image, at which Pythagoras remained to
study a
long time, and which was visited by Plato for the same
purpose. And this was the
temple which Eupolemus, if my memory do not fail me, says, was daiicated to Jupiter,
on Mount Hargerizim. Epiphanius says, that at Sichem were the remains of a
Proseucha, raised up in the open air by the Samaritans, in a circular form. This was
probably that named by Joshua.1' Ebal and Gerizim were two hills, so near that a
man could be hard from one to the other, and Sichem lay in the valley between them.;
Samaria, Schecham, Sichem, Ebal, and Gerizim, were all so near
together, that they might
be almost considered as the same place.
Thus we see that great stones are ordered as a memorial, 8rc. They are directed to be
of whole stones ; they are directed to be unworked or
unengraved; and theyare directed to
be plaistered. This description answers in every respect to the great stones or
temples
of the Druids in Britain. It is evident that they were as little worked as
possible; tazata
sed non
perdolataferro. Tools to get them, or cut them out of the quarry, must have
been used. Is it not possible that the stones were ordered to be rough and unworked, by
Moses, in order to prevent the adopting of the idolatrous custom, practised in Egypt, of
engraving hieroglyphics or
allegorical emblems on them ?-one of the Egyptian customs
which the Israelites, amongst all their offences, are not accused ofhavingadopted, and which
'
Preciselyu Moses does, when, in Geamia, he speaks ofsanctifying the Seventh day.

the ordering of them to be covered with plaister probably prevented. On not one ofthe
early Druid temples can a
single inscription be found; this would be naturally the effect
if they were originally covered with plaister. When the immense labour and expense
which such temples as Stonehenge required are
considered, no one can believe that they
would, when in use, be in the rude, desolate state in which they are now found. They
would probably be gildfds and most
magnificently ornamented, as from history we know
was the case with some of them in Ireland.
The Irish historians state, that one of their sacred Lithoi was covered with a
plate of
gold; a metal with which it is probable that they were acquainted before they knew any
thing of iron.
VALLENCEY AND OTHERS ON ANCIENT CIRCULAR '1`EMPLES.*'CH. VI. SECT. XXI.
Mr. Vallencey SUS,
"
Great stress has been laid on the deficiency of pillared temples,
after the Grecian order, to prove that the ancient Irish were ignorant of the fine arts;
but, if we can shew that all the Eastern world had no other kind of temples originally,
and that this custom continued long with the Canaanites, that aspersion will be removed.
"
When the Israelites entered Canaan, the Canaanites had no other kind of places of
public worship. When Moses ordered them to
destroy all false deities of the Canaanites,
he mentions no
temples: Overthrow their altars, cut down their groves, and burn them,
are his commands. The Scripture does not mention one temple destroyed by Joshua,
his successor.
"
Such were the kind of temples Solomon built for his wives: according to the Hebrew
text, he constructed mounts on the hill opposite to Jerusalem; the Scripture, speaking
of the zeal of Josias for the purity ofthe worship of God, says,
'
that he deliled the high
places on the right hand of the mount of Scandal, that Solomon had made to Astaroth, the
God of the Sidonians; to Clunnos, the scandal of the Moabites; and to Melcliam, the
abomination of the Ammonites-that he broke their pillars, and cut down their groves'
"
The Canaanites in alter times, to obtain more respect for these places, destined to
the public worship of their religion, and to prevent them from being profaned by cattle,
inclosed them with entrenchments of earth, but they were always open at top. This
intrenchment, in their language, was "ITA gdr, gadir: in Irish, Gathair and Cathair, the
3- being commutable with c, and the d with t, in all languages; hence Cathai:-,* a barrow,
-mp ktr, kether, circulus. Such was the temple near Orthosia, described by Maundrell:
such was that on mount Carmel visited by Pythagoras: such was the temple of '7p1'|8
aurlcl, Orchol, or the Sun, falsely called Hercules, at Tyre: of Astarte, at Sidon: of
Venus, at Biblos: and that consecrated at mount Casius by the descendants of the Dios-
curi, was originally of this form. Such was the temple of Hercules at Gadir or
Gadiz.'|'

"
Wherever the P/urmoici went, and wherever the Tyrians followed them, they pre-
served this form. That of Juno, near the river Grubrosus, in the isle of Samos, was
always open at top, and remained so in the time of Strabo, though filled with statues
executed by the greatest masters. When Pausanias travelled into that part of Greece,
where Cadmus had established the Phoenician or
Scythian religion, the temples were
only Gadirim or inclosed places-' They are not rooi`ed,' says he, '
they contain no statues,
nor do they know to what Gods they were consecrated, a sure mark of their antiquity)-
"
The Scheremissi of Siberia are a
Pagan people under the government of Casan. They
have no idols of wood or stone, but direct their prayers towards heaven in the open air,
and near
great trees, to which they pay honours and hold their assemblies about them.
The hides and bones of sacrificed animals they hang about their holy trees to rot, as a
sacrifice to the air.'
"
The temple built by Cadmus in the isle of Rhodes, in consequence of a vow to
Neptune, was of this nature; and hence Diodorus Siculus, to express its form, uses
the Greek word rapavag, that is, an inclosure consecrated to some deity; 789065, nemus,
delubrum, locus quivis separatus in honorem dei alicujus aut herois; fanum, sacellum,
lucus, from -rap.m§w, consecro, which derives from -np.vm, to cut, to separate-that which
is separated or
distinguished from another.
"
Sir Isaac Newton observes, that altars were at first erected without temples, and this
custom continued in Persia till after the days of Herodotus: in Phcenicia they had altars
with little houses for eating the sacrifices much earlier, and these they called high places.
I meet with no mention of sumptuous temples, says he, before the days of Solomon.1'
"
Plutarch tells us, that the Egyptians in general had uncovered temples; they are
only inclosures, says he, and exposed to the air. Clemens Alex. informs us, that all the
temples dedicated to Neith, i. e. Minerva, were open. In this the Phaanicians diH`ered;
for that dedicated to Ogga or Minerva, discovered by Abbé Fourmont, was covered,
though built of rude stones, like our Irish temples.;
"
The Greeks too had their open temples. Vitruvius informs us, that those sacred to
Jupiter, to thunder, to the sun, and to the moon, were open and exposed to the air.
"
Those of the Assyrians, full of statues, must also have been open, for Baruch says,
that owls perched on their heads, and that the faces of the Babylonian idols were black-
ened by the wind driving' the smoke on them. '
"
The Persians, or ancient southern Scythians, from whom the Irish descended, ridi-
culed the custom of shutting up the divinity, who ought to have the universe as an altar:
Jovemque Cosli circulum nuncupassent. (Brissonius.)

The ruins of Chilminor, falsely thought to be the reniains of a
palace, plainly shew
it was a
temple, open, according to the patriarchal mode. Here also was the original
sepulchre of their ancient kings, as Dr. Stukeley has ti1Uy proved in a memoir read to
the A. S. of London, 15th Feburary, 1759,-whence its Irish name Teidmuir, the walls
ofthe dead-hence the contracted name Tadmor, by which it was once known in history.
"
And when Celsus wrote against the Christians, in the 2nd century of the church,
the Sc_yt1u'ans, the Nomades of Africa, the Seres, and many others, had only open temples.
The foundation of the temple of the Syrian goddess at
Hieropolis, is attributed to the
Scytlaian Deucalion ; it was
undoubtedly open at first, and had been rebuilt many times
on the ruins of the old one. Lucian acknowledges, that the one
subsisting in his time,
had been built many ages after Deucalion lived, or after Semiramis or Artis or Bacc/ws,
to whom some attribute the building of it.""
Pausanias, in Corintlziacis, informs us, that near the Chernarus is a
septum or circle of
stones. He also writes, that the Thracians used to build their temples round and open at
the top in Bceotia. He speaks of such at Haliarms by the name of Naos, equivalent to the
Hebrew Beth or N: bit, which Jacob called his pillar. He speaks of several altars dedi-
cated to Pluto, set in the middle of areas fenced with stones: and they are called Hermio-
nenses. The famous and beautiiirl temple of the Pantheon at Rome, dedicated to all the
Gods, always was, and yet is, open at the top. And lastly, we must not forget that the
temples of the Persians were all, before the time of Zoroaster, open to the heavens; for
he it was who first taught them to worship in caves and inclosed buildings.
On a
passage of Homer's Iliad Mr. King has observed, that Pope has not seized the
spirit of the original, which has an evident reference to a stone circle. He gives the
following translation, for the notice of which I am
obliged to W. A. Miles, Esq., of
the county of Dorset:
"
The heralds at length appeased the populace, and the elders sat on (oval) rough-/lean
stones within a sacred circle, and held in their hands the sceptral rods of the loud pro-
claiming heralds. To which, or on
receiving them, they then rose from their seats, and in
alternate order gave judgment, whilst in the midst lay two talents of gold, to be bestowed
on him who with these should pronounce the rightfi1lsentence."1'
I have no doubt that the remains of this kind of temples would be found in other

parts of the world, as well as in Europe, if they were
diligently searched for. In Char-
din's Travels* will be found the description of one in Persia.
He says,
"
Upon the leh: hand of the road are to be seen large circles of hewn stone;
which the Persians adirm to be a great sign; that the Caons making war in Media, held
a council in that place-it being the custom of these people, that every oliicer that came
to the council should bring a stone with him, to serve instead of a chair. And these
Caons were a sort of giants. But that which is most to be admired, after observation of
these stones, is this, that they are so big that eight men can hardly move one, and yet
there is no place from whence they can be imagined to have been fetched, but from the
next mountains, that are six leagues off."
NUMBER 0F THE CIRCLES IS 'NOT A PROOF THAT THEY ARE NOT_TEM'PLE$.
CRAP. VI. SECT. XXII.
Dr. Macculloch observes, that the circular collections of stones cannot have all been
for the purpose of worship, because in many places there are several of them in one
place
or very near
together. This is what often took place with the old heathen temples, and
is continued in the Romish churches. On the prornontory of Ancona,1* the great
cathedral is surrounded with little churches or
chapels, formerly several temples. The
oldest church in Bologna, known to have been a temple of Isis from the inscription
on it, of Domince victrici Isidi, was a collection of temples, and is now a collection of
churches. Another collection of temples was over the waterfall at Tivoli. What is St.
Peter's at Rome, surrounded with its chapels, but a collection of churches, each dedicated
to its own Saint, as meh temple was dedicated to its own Demigod?
Much unnecessary trouble has been taken to shew that the circular structures were

not religious because national adairs were transacted in them. But this all rather tends
the other way. They were resorted to because they were sacred places. Thus Samuel
made Bethel and Gilgal the annual seats of judgment. At Gilgal Saul was confirmed
king, and the allegiance of his people renewed with sacrifices and great festive joy. At
Mizpah, Jephtha was solemnly invested with the government of Gilead, and the general
council against Benjamin seems to have been held here. At the stone of Schechem
erected by Joshua, Ahimelech was made king. Adonijah was installed by the stone of
Zoheleth. Jehoash was crowned king, standing by a
pillar, as the manner was.'* Josiah
stood by a
pillar when he was making a solemn covenant with God.'|°
Caesar says;
"
the Druids assemble in a TEMPLE (consecrated place) at a certain
season of the year, in the territories of the Carnutes, which is reckoned the centre of all
Gaul."
Mr. Huddleston maintains, that there were two kinds of Druidical circles, one for
worship and the other for courts of justice: and he is as usual angry that any person
should entertain a different opinion. He thinks, that all those without centre stones
are courts. I do not say, he cannot possibly be right, but I think there is no evidence
to decide the question either one
way or the other.
AGREEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF STONES IN' THE CIRCLES WITH THE ANCIENT
CYCLES.-CHAP. VI. SECT. XXIII.
The most extraordinary peculiarity which the Druidical circles possess, is that ot
their agreement in the number of the stones of which they consist with the ancient astro-
nomical cycles. The outer circle of Stonehenge consists of 60 stones, the base of the
most famous of all the cycles of antiquity. The next circle consists of 4-0 stones, but
one on each side ofthe entrance is advanced out of the line, so as to leave nineteen stones, a
metonic cycle, on each side, and the inner, of one metonic cycle, or nineteen stones.§ At
Abury we find all the outward circles and the avenues make up exactly the 600, the
Neros, which Josephus says was known before the flood. The outer circles are
exactly
the number of degrees in each of the twelve parts, into which, in my aerial castle-building,
I divided the circle, viz. 80, and into which at iirst the year was divided, and the inner
ofthe number of the divisions of the circle, viz. 12, and of the months in the year. We
see the last measurement of Stonehenge, taken by Mr. Waltire, makes the second circle
4-0; but for the sake of marking the two cycles of 19 years, two of the stones, one on
each side of the entrance, have been placed a little within. I think it very likely that
the outer circle of the hackpen of 40 stones, was originally formed in the same manner.

§ This cycle is generally attributed by the Greeks to a man alled Meton, ofcourse one of their countrymen ; but
it was known in the East many generations before his time.
2-1-0 AGREEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF STONES IN' THE CIRCLES, &c.-snot. XXIII.
Surely it is not improbable that what is found in one temple, should have been originally
in thc other? I also think that the whole number ofstones which Stonehenge consisted
ofwas 14-4-, according to Mr. Waltire's model-and including along with it three stones
which could not be described in Mr. Waltire's model for want of room; thus making
the sum-total of stones amount exactly to the Oriental cycle or Van of 144- years.

AGREEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF STONES IN THE CIRCLES, &C.=SECT. XXIII. 24-I
Of these, the whole number of the onrwano stuns ofthe structure make 600, viz.,
100 + S0 + 80 + 200 + 4-0 + 200 =
600, the cycle of the Neros, alluded to in Chap-
ter II. Section XIII. The whole ofthe smaller circles make 14-2. SO + 12 + 80 + 12 +
4-0 + 18 = I4-2. When I consider all the other circumstances of the attachment of the
Druids to cycles, I cannot help suspecting, that they have been 14-4-; that there is some
mistake. I think it not unlikely that the inner circle of the serpent's head was 19, a Me-
tonic cycle, and that it had an obelisk in the centre, or that in some other way the 14-4-
was
completed. Many persons will think this very trifling. It certainly may appear so
to them, but we must recollect it is all connected with judicial astrology, the most
trifling
of sciences, from which nothing but such nonsense can be expected.
If all the stones of Abury be taken, except the inner circles, you will have the num-
ber 608, a very curious number, the sacred number of the god Sol, already described in
Ch. IV. Sec. VIII. to which I beg to refer my reader. If this be the effect ofaccident, it is
an odd accident. Again, the several following numbers make up 365, being numbers of
separate parcels of stones constituting this temple: 3 + 2 + 100 + 200 + 4-0 + 18 + I
-l' I = 365.
At Biscau-woon, near St. Buvien's, in Cornwall, there is a circular temple, consisting
of 19 stones, and a twentieth stone stands in the centre, much higher than the rest.
I beg my reader to refer to the description of the temple at Classerniss in the Intro-
duction, plate No. 28. There he will again find the Metonic cycle.
Near Clenenney, in North Wales, is a circle, containing 38 stones-two Metonic
cycles!
Near Keswick is an oval of 40 stones. This I have little doubt is in number 4-0, for
the same reason as the second circle at Stonehenge, already explained.'|'
Dr. Borlase says, "There are
jbur circles in the hundred of Penwith, Cornwall, (the
most distant two of which are not eight miles asunder,) which have nineteen stones each,
a surprising uniformity, expressing, perhaps, the two principal divisions of the year, tl1e
twelve months, and the seven days of the week. Their names are Boscawen'uun, Ros-
modereny, Tregaseal, and Boskednan."¢ Here the similarity could not escape Dr.
Borlase; but the idea of a
cycle never occurred to him. There is no room to attribute
any thing here to imagination.
The great temple at Rolrich, in Oxfordshire, is surrounded with 60 upright stones;
the cycle of Vrihaspati, an example not far distant from the others.
At the time that Dr. Borlase wrote his History of Cornwall, from which the descrip-
tion ofthe circles in that county is taken, he had no idea that the number of stones of
which the circles consisted was of any great consequence, or we should have found some
observations respecting that point. And when the labour which has been used to

destroy them is taken into the account, it seems highly probable that the true number
would not be ascertained without much trouble and care to discover, from the hollows
in the ground, the places where some had stood, but at that time gone; and also to dis-
tinguish pieces of stones from whole ones, in those cases in which they had been broken
into two-without which their number would be deceptively increased. From these consi-
derations, and when I recollect so
many temples in which the circles are
cycles, and many
others where they are said not to form cycles, the Hurlers for instance, I cannot help
suspecting that they have been originally one of 12, and two of 19 each. Again, when I
look at the Botalleh circles of St. Just, Plate 29, I cannot help suspecting that circle C
has consisted of two cycles of I9 each; the circle F of one 19; the circle H of two; the
circles D and E of two of 30 each; and that the whole has been intended to represent an
astronomical planetary system of some kind. We must not forget that these people
were all magi and astrologers!
In the bogs of Ireland instruments have been found, probably talismans, evidently
having a reference to these cycles. Col. Vallencey says, that no
images of gold or
silver have ever been found in the bogs of Ireland, but only unhewn stones capped with
gold and silver, to represent the sun and moon, surrounded by twelve other luminaries,
or
by nineteen others, to represent the lunar cycle.'|'
In the course of last summer a Druidical monument was discovered in Somersetshire,
consisting of a
great number of circles, like the Botalleh circles, intersecting each other.
THE CRDSSES AND GLOBES AT IONA AND ANCIENT CYCLES.1CH. YI. SECT. XXIV.
In the Island of I-com-kill, at the monastery of the Culdees, at the time of the Refor-
mation, there were S60 crosses; whether placed in a circle does not appear. What has
the number 860 to do with Christianity? I beg my reader to look back to my first
chapter, where I have described the way in which I conceived the circle became divided
into S60 parts, and to retain it in mind as we
proceed.
Pennant says,
"
On this road is a large and elegant cross, called that of Macleane, one
of three hundred and sixty, that were standing in this island at the Reformation; but
immediately after, were almost entirely demolished, by order of a
provincial assembly
held in the island."§ This cross was
probably saved by having had some Christian
ornament engraved on it, if it were one of the 360, which I should rather doubt; or
'
Mr. Maurice thinks, with much probability, that the numbers of the stones of their temple being exadly equal
to the years in tba different cycles were adopted to prevent the loss of the knowledge of these cycles.

perhaps it might save itself by having the idolatrous emblems (as they called them) worn

Mr. Pennant, speaking of Iona, says,
"
A little north-west of the door of the church
is the pedestal of a cross: on it are certain stones, which seem to have been the support
of a tomb. Numbers who visit this island (I suppose the elect, impatient for the con-
summation of all things) think it incumbent on them to turn each of these thrice round,
according to the course of the sun. They are called Claca-bratba, for it is thought that

were three noble globes, of white marble, placed on three stone basins, and these were
turned round ; but the synod ordered them and sixty crosses to be thrown into the sea.
!
The present stones are, probably, substituted in place of these globes.

two oriental Vans of 144- and of 180 years, we shall soon perceive that they correspond
with no astronomical cycle.
"
It appears to me that these numbers were chosen, and these divisions made, for the
purpose of multiplying certain numbers into one another, which denoted the years in
which some great sideral revolution took place."
All these cycles and divisions were the fanciful productions of judicial astrology; at
least all of them which had not the movement oi' the heavenly bodies for their basis. But
they all arose out of the first division of the circle into 860 degrees, and 72 the dodecans,
as described in my lirst chapter. They found that the whole circle consisted of 72 dode-
cans of 5 calculi each; by multiplying them they got 360, the whole circular number.
Again they found the whole circle consisted of 12 signs; by multiplying these again by
5, the number of degrees of which each dodecan consisted, they got 60. By dividing the
number of years, in a
precessional year by this number, they got 4-32,'° which they made
the basis of all their grand cycles and periods. From the 60 also, they made their cycle
of the Savos of 3,600 years. If] instead of the lirst division of the circle being made into
360, some other number had been taken, 240 for instance, all the cycles would of course
have consisted of diiliarent numbers. The probable way by which it came to consist of
360, I think I have shewn in the first chapter.
It is a curiou fact that all thesevans and cycles derive their names from Chinese
Tartary; they are not of Indian growth. Their names bespeak them the descendants of
Baillie's primeval nation, about latitude 4-5. Can any thing be more striking than this?
The modern Bramins know little about them; but they will not confess their ignorance.
Thus they account for the cycle of 60 years,-the cyle of Vrihaspati, by saying that it
arises from 5 revolutions of the planet Jupiter; this is so wide of the truth that it never
can have arisen from this cause. The makers of these vans and the discoverers of the
periods of 600 years and of 25,920 years, knew better; but they were not the Hindoos
of Bengal.
The revolution of Jupiter is performed in ll years, 313 days, 8 hours. Then hve
revolutions will not make 60 years, but only 55 years, 201 days, 16 hours-a difference
abundantly suliicient to disprove the assertions of the modern Bramins, that the cycle of
Vrihaspati was formed by iive revolutions of this planet.

almost two thousand years. And whence does it at last come?
Colonel Vallencey shall tell us-It comes from the Druids.
The Irish had two words, Matlzaraglnas and Abarachas, epithets given by the Druids
to the true God. Mather and Abar in Irish signify God-the lirst cause. And Aghas
or Aches good luck. Hence comes the famous word Abraxas, which has puzzled all

24-8 THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF LETTERS--'CHAP. YI. SECT. XXVI-
The circumstances of these alphabets are very curious. The reader will not fail to
observe the Sad and Tzadi for the number 90, which has no letter in the Greek but
the epzleemon bau. Notwithstanding this slight discrepancy, I think he cannot deny,
that the Greek, the Hebrew, and the Arabic, are the same systems, and he must also
allow that the Irish is the same as the Arabic, and as the Greek before it first gained or
made, then lost, its Digamma. For it must have been first Vau, then Digamma or V,
as F, then Digamma, which it after a time lost. The circumstance of the Irish having
the Digamma, stamps its antiquity in a manner which I think cannot be overthrown.
It cannot have learned its alphabet iiom the Romans, for if it had, it would have had 22
letters. It cannot have learned it from the Greeks after they lost their Digamma, because
if it had, it would not have had the Digamma. It cannot have learned its alphabet from
the Samaritan or Hebrew after the Pentateuch was written, because if it had, it would
have had 22 letters. But Dr. Morton, in his table of alphabets, has shewn that Mr.
Chishull has reduced the Phoenician alphabet to seventeen primary or original characters,
therefore it may have learned its alphabet either from the Phrnnicians before their alphabet
was increased, or from the Arabians.
The Shin, Shin, and Sigma, I have substituted for the Sin, Samech and Xi which are
in the Bishop's table, and which is evidently a mistake-the Greek Xi being one of the
new letters. This mistake is a most fortunate circumstance, because it proves that the
Bishop did not know the principle of these alphabets which I have been unfolding,
and therefore cannot have made his number of letters to suit it. And it also renders it
impossible for any one to say, that be has been contriving his 17 primary letters to make
them suitable to the Irish, whose letters he probably looked on with too much contempt
to have ever considered them for a single moment. The way in which all the circum-
stances combine to support my system, is preferable to any written evidence whatever.

Thus, also, the reader sees the number of my 28 calculi, and sees it also interwoven
into my first man's decimal arithmetic in a very curious manner-the 1000 exactly
answering to the number of 28 figures.
'rnaoav or 'ran oarcnv or r.a'r'rans.-cuar. vr. sncr. xxvr. 24-9
As Bishop Burgess had not the most distant idea of the theory advocated by me, the
circumstance of his making out the 17 letters of Arabia to be the identical 17 letters of
Ireland, is one of the most convincing arguments which can be imagined in favour of it;
and the same argument in some measure
applies to the number of the figures being 28,
and to my theory of the origin of the invention of numbers. It will be said that the coin-
cidence of number of letters to my 28 calculi is accidental. But, pray, is it accidental
that the elements of the Irish letters, the Mim, Nun, &e., are :Q be found in the
Arabic, and that the powers of notation are the same in similar letters till it comes to
19; that is, similar in 19 instances in succession P-facts which cannot be for a moment
disputed. It is a very.curious accrnaxr that in each of the 19 cases, the letters and
numbers should agree in the different languages.
If I be told that the present Arabic alphabet is, comparatively speaking, modem, I
reply, However the forms of its letters may have been changed by the Califs, the prin-
ciple, the system, is evidently ancient, both of the letters and figures. No one can for a
moment believe that they mvanrzn A naw alphabet and system of notation, which by
mere accident coincided with all the old systems of the world; it involves a contradic-
tion in terms.
The Greek, the Hebrew, and the Arabic systems are
evidently the same; though in
the latter numbers, from some unknown cause, a
change takes place, and the powers of
notation vary; but they do not vary till they get to the 19th letter, where the hundreds
begin. From all this I am inclined to think, that the Arabic language, in which all the
roots of Hebrew and Chaldee words are found, was a
language before the existing
systems of the Hebrew, Greek, Sanscrit, and Deva Nageri letters were invented;
that the first svsrnm of arithmetic was that now
possessed by the Arabians, though not
invented by them in their present country at least, and that the inventors of the first
alphabet made it of right lines at angles, and called it after certain names of its numbers,
which at that time probably, in the first lost language, had the names of trees; and that
fiom this came all the allegories of Gnosticism, respecting the trees in the garden of
Eden, held by the Valentinians, Basilideans, Bardesanians, Src., allegories of Gnosticism,
the produce of a very ancient oriental system, in existence long previous to the birth of
Christ-the tree bearing twelve fruits, one in each month, &c., &c.° The alphabet was
the wood or forest ;'|' the tree was the Beth-luis-nion Ogham system; the upright stem,
the 8553 a@a, the Chaldee name for a trunk of a
tree.1° The letters were the leaves
growing out of the stem, and the fruits were the doctrines and knowledge of good and
evil, learned by means of receiving these doctrines from letters. The allegory may be
nonsensical enough, but it is pretty and ingenious, and is precisely the Gnostic allegory

with the Irish word Beth-luis-nion Ogham inserted into it. It is the allegory alluded to
in the Welsh poem of Taliessin of the Battle of the Trees, noticed in Chap. I. Sect. xxx.,
th battle between good and evil, light and darkness, Oromasdes and Arimanius. The
e
dance of the trees to the Orphean lyre, noticed in the same Sect1on,1s a Grecian allegory
from the same source, and so is the Elm-tree which Eneas found loaded with dreams at
h `d f the road to the infernal regions-the tree called by the name ot' the first

letter of the alphabet, the alpa, the trunk which bears all the rest, the ailm loaded with
ienc histories sermons poems, theories of philosophers, and this book amongst the
3¢ es s 9
rest in a
very conspicuous part, a heavy dream I fear, "
which, like the baseless fabric ofa
vision (or a dream,) shall leave not a rack behind."
If m reader will look to the Greeks, he will lind that they have substantially the same
Y
s tem as the others; their notation to nine hundred being represented by letters, till
YS
they come to that last. number, when they coin a form, and for the thousand use the
a, with a comma or mark thus 9. It is evident that the system has been the same in
its origin as the Arabian. The loss of the digamma in part accounts for the variation;
but how it was lost no one knows.
THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF NUMBERS, OF THE FIRST CHAPTER, RESUMED,
CHAP. VI. SECT. XXVII.
A very careful inquiry was made by Dr. Parsons some years ago into the arithmetical
systems of the different nations of America, and a result was found which confirms my
theory in a
very remarkable manner. It appears from his information, that they must
either have brought the system with them when they arrived in America, or from the
same natural impulse which I have pointed out in my first Chapter, Section vi., they
must have adopted the same process. The ten lingers with one, must have operated
the same as with the other. They all, according to their several languages, give names
to each unit, liom one to ten, which is their determinate number, and proceed to add an
unit to the ten' till there are two tens, to which sum they givea peculiar name, and so on
t comes to ten times ten, or to any number of tens. This
is also practised amongst the Malays, and indeed all over the East; but to this, amongst
the Americans, there is one curious exception, and that is the practice of the Caribbeans.
They make their determinate period at five, and add one to the name of each of these
live, till they complete ten, and they then add two fives, which bring them to twenty,
beyond which they do not go. They have no words to express ten or twenty; but a
to three tens, four tens, and till i
periphrasis on sentence is made use o£1°

am not greatly mistaken, I shall be able now to give some of them a terrestrial foundation
-my theory of the invention of figures and letters will become something more than an
unsubstantial dream. From this account of Dr. Parsons's, it seems
pretty clear that
these Americans cannot have brought their figures and system of notation with them
from the old world, but must have invented them; because if they had, they would have
all brought the decimal system, and not some of them have stopped at the quinquennial,
as it appears the Caribbees did. If they had come away after the invention of letters,
they would have brought letters with them; if after the invention of figures, but before
letters, they would all have had the decimal notation. From this it follows, that they
must have migrated either before the invention of letters and figures, or
they were
ig-
norant persons, and did not bring the art with them. If this latter were the case, then
my aerial theory of the mode of invention must have taken place entirely, and to its hill
extent, with the Americans, (which proves my assumed natural process in the discovery
to be correct,) and in part, though only not to the full extent, with the Caribbees: but the
same natural process must have influenced both, which proves that my theory is rational
and probable, and really has a principle of human nature for its foundation. I think the
fact of the Caribbees having proceeded by the same route, but having only gone part of
the way, is a
strong circumstance confirmatory of my hypothesis.
The learned Mr. Sharon Turner, in a treatise on the ancient languages, in one of
the Essays published among the Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, has the
following passages, which I consider to be entirely in favour of the doctrines which I
advocate. He has erected a Corinthian edifice without a suiiicient foundation. My
work will supply for him a rustic basement, and complete the building:
"
That there are adinities existing and now observable in all the known languages of
the world, which have occurred to our examination, that cannot with any reasonable
probability, from their number and nature, be attributed to chance-that these adinities
occur in terms that are likely to have been used by the earliest progenitors of mankinch
because they express the most endearing feelings, or the most common ideas; but that
they exist in every language, like so many fragments, more or less insulated amid a
general mass of the greatest diversities-that both these affinities, and these diversities,
must have had adequate causes, or neither could have appeared; and that it is the oliice
of philosophical philology to endeavour to trace their historical causation."*
In another place he says,
"
That this revolution began by a supernatural agency
directed to produce it, and which is recorded, in the only work that mentions it, to have
been efected by a contiision of lip,1° is expressly asserted in that work ; and the assertion
is corroborated by an actual confusion of lip or pronunciation, manifestly appearing in

the very elements of the few words of universal use which I have selected as specimens,
and as tests and trials of the verity of the assertion."
The Mexicans divided the year into eighteen parts, of twenty days each, and added
five intercalary days. They made their centuries fifty-two years in length. That this
comes from the same principle as that of the old world is very evident, from the name
they give to their twenty days' division, viz. Mextli, which signifies rnoon.'|' Here
again we come to my lunar cycle tbl' our first regulator oi' letters and numbers.
DOCTRINES OF SIB. WILLIAM JONES CONTR0VERTED.1CHAP. VI. SECT. XXVIII.
Sir William Jones, in his Sixth Discourse to the Asiatic Society, admits distinctly
that the Celtae and the Irish came from Armenia; but in consequence of his being ham-
pered with what he thought the meaning of Genesis, he falls into the very great mistake
of placing the first nation, from whence came knowledge, languages, and arts, in Iran or
Persia. He says, the Persian was the parent of the Sanscrit, the Zend, the Greek, the
Latin, and the Gothic (which he says is Celtic). Now the reader has already seen, Chap.
I. Sect. xiv., that the Persian and Arabic are in ihct the same. This brings Sir W.
Jones precisely to my point as to the identical origin of the languages. If the ancient
Persian and Arabic be the same, then the Arabic to which I have traced the Irish, ac-
cording to him, must be the origin of languages. Ireland is very like to Arabia in this
respect, that it has been very little mixed with other tribes; it has, like Arabia, lived a
life more secluded than the central countries, which were always mixing together. Pro-
bably about the same time, namely, at the dispersion, the Celtic wave flowed to Ireland,
and the Arabic wave to Arabia.
In fact the only two nations of the old world which had never suH`ered fiom foreign
invasion to the time of Christ, were Arabia and Ireland. For this reason alone we
may
expect to End their ancient languages or systems of letters the least changed, as in fact
we do find them.
The following is a
passage from Sir W. Jones, which, amongst various opposing doc-
trines, admits enough to establish my system, if he be right. I beg my reader's attention
to the parts which I have put in Italics: _
"
It has been proved by clear evidence and plain reasoning, that a
poaverfirl monarchy
was established in Iran long hefbre the Assyrian governmeni; that it was in truth a
Hindoo monarchy, though, if any choose to call it Cuscan, Cusdean, or
Scythian, we shall
not enter into a debate on mere names; that it subsisted many centuries, and that its
hiS¢0ry has been engrqfkd on that of the Hindoos, who founded the monarchies of

Ayodhya and Indraprestha; that the language of the first Persian empire was the mother
ofthe Sanscrit, and consequently of the Zend and Parsi, as well as of Greek, Latin, and
Gothic; that the language of the Assyrians was the parent of Chaldaic and Pahlavi, and
that the primary Tartarian language also had been current in the same
empire; although,
as the Tartars had no books, or even letters, we cannot with certainty trace their un-
polished and variable idioms. We discover, therefore, in Persia, at the earliest dawn of
history, the three distinct races of men whom we described on former occasions as
pos-
sessors of India, Arabia, and Tartary; and whether they were collected in Iran from
distant regions, or
diverged from it, as from a common centre, we shall easily determine
from the following considerations. Let us observe, in the first place, the central position
of Iran, which is bounded by Arabia, by Tartary, and by India; whilst Arabia lies con-
tiguous to Iran only, but is remote from Tartary, and divided even from the skirts of
India by a considerable gulfl No country, therefore, but Persia, seems likely to have
sent forth its colonies to all the kingdoms of Asia: the Brahmans could never have mi-
grated from India to Iran, because they are expressly forbidden, by their oldest existing
laws, to leave the region which they inhabit at this day: the Arabs have not even a tra-
dition of an emigration into Persia before Mohamed; nor had they, indeed, any induce-
ment to quit their beautiful and extensive domains: and as to the Tartars, we have no
trace in history of their departure from their plains and forests till the invasion of the
Medes, who, according to etymologists, were the sons of Madai, and even
they were con-
ducted by princes of an Assyrian family. The three races, therefore, whom we have
already mentioned, (and more than three we have not yet found,) migrated from Iran as
from their common country; and thus the Saxon chronicle, on good authority, brings the
jirst inhabitants of Britain from Armenia; while a late very learned writer concludes,
after all his laborious researches, that the Goths or
Scythians came from Persia; and
another contends, with great force, that both the Irish and old Britons proceeded severally
from the borders of the Caspian; a coincidence of conclusions from diferent media, by
persons wholly unconnected, which could scarce have happened if they were not
grounded on solid principles. We may, therefore, hold this proposition firmly esta-
blished, that Iran or Persia, in its largest sense, was the centre of population, of know-
ledge, of languages, and of arts; which, instead of travelling westward only, as it has
been fancifully supposed, or eastward, as with equal reason might have been asserted,
expanded in all directions to all the regions of the world."
There are here principles enough admitted to establish my doctrine. His original
nation is proved clearly, and had Sir W. not been hampered with the mistaken passage of
Genesis, he never would have placed it any where but where Baillie, for astronomical"
reasons, and all Oriental and Grecian history, place it-East of the Caspian Sea. He
saw the diiiiculty of the position which he had taken, and, in order to obviate it, he
is obliged to use the words in its largest sense, so as to carry his Persia, in fact, to the
254- DOCTRINES or sin w. JONES corxrnovanrnn.-can. vt. sscr. xxvnr.
country of Bactriana, of which Baillie speaks; and the whole extract exhibits an extra-
ordinary example of learned confusion.
He could not be ignorant of the truth, that the celestial constellations of the Bramin
'cal H' d
mythology were scarcely visible at Benares-that the mythological, astronomi , in oo
`
nse as a lied to Bengal but are easily applicable to the slate of the
allegories are nonse , pp ,
heavens between latitudes 4-0 and 50.* In fact, in that latitude they want no
explana-
tion-the asterisms speak for themselves. It is absurd to suppose that persons should
iately over their heads, and form their mythoi, allegories, &c.,
neglect the stars immed
from those in the horizon scarcely visible to them.
If there were three original languages, as he intimates, they all branched off from Bac»
triana; and if the tirst Tartars or Scythians were only a succession of the Celtaa or
Gomerians, as cannot, I think, be doubted, it has been proved that they had the same
stem as the Arabic Hebrew, Greek, and old Latin; and had probably the ancient,
sy ,
right-lined, angular letters, the letters of Ireland, the old Etruscan, or those of Persepolis.
In the extract above, the reader sees the argument of Sir W. is, that Persia must have
been the lace of the first nation, because of its central situation; and surely nothing can
P
be weaker, except it be his argument respecting the Hindoos not emlgrating on account
of their law, when the time he refers to must have been before that law had an existence,
when the mother of the Sanscrit, to which he alludes, was spoken. But he is
hampered
with the mistaken passage about Ararat, and, as he declared that he would never believe
an thing against the book of Genesis, he is driven to shut his eyes to the truth, when,
Y
if he had determined manfully to seize it, book or not book, he would have found what
any person of common sense will expect to find, that if the book be true, any new dis-
covery will dovetail into it and make its truth shine forth with the greater brilliancy.
Sir William_Jones is obliged to admit, that the Sanscrit was not the native of upper
India, but that it "
was introduced by conquerors from other kingdoms in some very
remote age." This exactly agrees with what Baillie has proved of their learning. Here,
it is evident, Sir William saw that it was not the produce of India. He was unwilling
to "ive it to the country described by Baillie, and, therefore, he seeks for some unknown
D
conqueror from he knows not where. Who formed the Sanscrit I do not pretend to say;
it was, comparatively speaking, a late invention. The Pracrlt was the original anguage,
if either was; and if it were not, it was descended from the universal mother who brought
forth Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Sanscrit, Latin, 8cc. However Sir William may twist and
turn his dates, this very remote age must have been long before the flood, according to the
received chronology. Mr. Maurice and Mr. Faber are the only two writers who have
reasoned candidly upon this subject; but they could not blind themselves to the truth,
and they were too honest to deny it.

The above admission by the Knight, of the foreign origin of the Sanscrit, is very im-
portant; I suspect he has not made a
proper distinction between the written and the
spoken language; I suspect that the written language, as
improved to its present perfect
state, was the work of the Buddists or the Brarnins,' but that the old spoken language,
the language which I have shewn is found in Ireland, and Italy, and Greece, was the first
spoken language, and I think it will turn out to have been the same as that of the book of
Job. But I beg my reader to observe, that these are all conjectures; I do not feel myself
competent to give an
opinion upon them. I cannot help suspecting that the worthy priest»
praised knight, in his distribution of the Brst languages into three, either not knowing or
not recollecting, that the doctrine of the contiision of Babel being of the lip, enunciation,
or the mode of speech, and not of the language, is supported by some of the most learned
orthodox divines, thought himself obliged to divide them into three at least, in order to
support the system. At all events, I am quite certain I have succeeded in proving him
mistaken, and that the systems of letters of Romans, Greeks, Celtaa, Jews, and Arabs,
are radically the same-the same 17 letter systemf I beg my reader to recollect, that
my hypothesis is proved by a
great number of facts, stated by different people, living at
different times, not one of whom had the slightest idea of its existence. It is supported
by a concurrence of circumstantial proofs, which beats all historical evidence whatever.
What can be so
striking as the fact of .ro
many diferent authors, without any connetion,
and ignorant of my theory, having made out the original number of letters of the different
alphabets to be seventeen, with the same powers of notation?
Mr. Huddleston has some very striking observations respecting the Celtic and Hebrew
languages, characteristic of his usual masculine understanding, in some of which I quite
agree with him.
"Of all the post-diluvian languages the Chaldaic has the fairest claim to antiquity.
Abraham was called from Ur of the Chaldees, and must have carried that language along
with him. The Hebrew language is, therefore, only a dialect of the Chaldaic. That the
Celtic is a dialect of the some language is highly probable. Nations have, in all ages,
been extremely solicitous to preserve their own name and the names of their gods. The
Chaldaic Chaldach, and the Gaelic Caltech, (a Celt,) are exactly the same. That the
same god, Bel, was the chief object of worship, in both nations, is beyond dispute. From
the same souroe the Bramins, the Phcenicians, the Hebrews, &c., borrowed their lan-
guage and their God Bel or Baal. The most probable etymon of the word Celt, or Cal-
tach, is Cealtaeh, (Latine C'aelestes,) i. e. 'men addicted to the study of the heavens?

Ceo! or Cal, in the Celtic, signiiies heaven, and its regular adjective is Cealtach or Cal-
taclu. The Chaldeans, from the most remote ages, have been famed for judicial astrology;
and the Celts, while their Druids remained, were equally celebrated."
I think my reader will now hardly be disposed to difer from Mr. Huddleston in the
assertion, that the Hebrew and Celtic are dialects of the same language; and the identity
of the gods is a very strong corroborative circumstance. Altogether, a body of evidence
is formed which seems to me to be quite irresistible, that the Irish Celtic is closely con.
nected with the very first language.
The learned Stiernhelm has the following expression: Lingua Hetrusca, Phrygia, et
Celtica, afiines sunt omnes; ex uno fonte derivate. Nec Graeca longe distat; Japethi-
cae sunt omnes, ergo et ipsa Latina. Non igitur mirum est innumera vocabula dictarum
linguarum, communia esse cum Latinis.
Leibnitz, in his Miscellanea Berolinensia, writes, that the Greeks and Latins descended
from a race of people, descendants of Japhet, who, because they came across the Tanais
and the Isther from the Scythian country, he says, he chooses to call Celto-Scythic,
which is merely as much as to say, the earfy Celtae, before they acquired the name of
Scythians.
At the latter part of Chapter I. Section xii. the reader will see an observation, that at
the end of Col. Vallencey"s grammar is aSamaritan alphabet, taken irom old coins, which
is almost identical in its forms with the Irish Bobeloth. On comparing the two, there
certainly appears a strong resemblance in some of the letters. Certainly, if two alpha.-
bets shew marks of resemblance, this is an important circumstance; but when I consider
the extraordinary changes which have taken place in the forms of the letters of all lan.
guages, dissimilarity between any two in their forms merely, furnishes no
argument
against their being the same in system. Look at Mr. Astle's exemplars of English letters
in the last seven or eight hundred years. What Col. Vallencey has said respecting the
agreement between the old Samaritan and the Boheloth, exactly agrees with Mr. Chi-
shull's Phoenician alphabet of seventeen original letters in Morton's table, which brings
the Phcnnician alphabet to the Arabic; but the Phmnician is Samaritan, and the Samari-
tan is Hebrew. These are coincidences so unlocked for, that they must carry conviction
to the most sceptical mind. From this it is evident, diat the Bobeloth was the language
which came to Ireland by the sailing persons, and the Beth-luis-nion, that which came
from Britain,-that which Mr. Davies says was used in Wales. Refer back to Chap. I.
Sect. xi.
In the following table ot' alphabets the first line, exclusive of the letters within the brack-
ets, consists ofthe seventeen primary letters of the ancient Phoenicians, as made out byMr.
Chishull, and copied from Dr. Morton's table of alphabets. The second and third lines
exhibit the Cadmean alphabet, written from right to left, and from left to right. The

I beg my reader to compare the lirst line of the above alphabets, the Phmnician, with
the two Irish alphabets in the second table of the first Chapter, No. I and 4-, and he will
see a
very extraordinary coincidence: he will see that the primary letters are identical
in all three, with the exception of the letter H, which is just sumcient to shew that there
has been no contrivance used to make them agree.
I have no doubt that the vowel U was
originally the sixth letter in all these alphabets;
but after it got changed by degrees into the V, then into the F or the Digamma, the
necessity of having a
separate sign for the vowel sound U obliged them to add a letter,
and it is found in those alphahets at the end, after the final letter Tau, T, and is merely
the letter V with a tail to it, Y. It is also found in the Irish, (vide Table 1, fig. 8,) and
in Table 2, fig. 1 and 6, though not at the end. This is another remarkable instance of
unexpected coincidence. Nothing can be better than this kind of circumstantial proofs.
From the whole argument I think a
strong probability is made out, that an
original
system of letters, or alphabet of I6 or 17 letters, was in use
by the first Bactrian nation;
that it was brought by one
colony along the 4-5th parallel of latitude to Gaul, Britain,
Wales, and Ireland, where it was called the Bethluisnion; and that it was brought by
another colony through Asia to Phmnicia, and by certain sailors to Ireland by the way
ofthe Pillars of Hercules, and was called the Bobeloth. This I think is pretty clear.
But what was the name of these sailors who brought it?

THE PELLSGI.1CHAP. VI. SECT. XXII.
Why should not the importers of the Bobeloth alphabet be the Pelasgi? The Pelasgi
were persons coming to Greece in ships from Asia, where the language of Phcenicia was
spoken. They have been called :uhh p@im, (refer back to Chapter I. Section xi.,)
which I think in their language, (by some means or other which I confess I cannot,
according to a
very strict etymological process, explain,) meant sailors. Dr. Parkhurst
says,
"
Jl75 pg a stream.-Hence Greek vraaa-yay, the sea; applied also to a
large river,
and Latin pelagus." Dr. Jones says,
"
:ram-ysgm, to sail through the deep." From this
I think came the vmtaa'-yor or sailors, and the Latin pelagius, sea-bred, of or
belonging
to the sea. Thus Pelagiae volucres, sea birds," Pelagii greges piscium.1' From this it
does not follow, that they were called by this name in their own first country. If I be
right, their name would originally answer very nearly to our term sailors. Thus it
came that Herodotus and others, who called them Aborigines; writing many hundred
years after the time of their arrival, and totally ignorant of their origin (as indeed Hero-
dotus§ honestly confesses of himself; and as Plato had done before him) made of them a
nation by that name.
They supposed that they brought with them a
language which
became the new
language, for the original seat or country of which, the ancients and
moderns have been ever since searching in vain. Numbers of mistakes of the Greeks
much more gross than this might be pointed out.
A very curious account of them may be seen in the first chapter of Bishop Marsh's
Hora! Pelasgicrz.
He there points out, that Strabo attributes the establishment of the oracle at Dodona
to them, which he shews is coniirmed by Herodotus ;|| and that the rites of the Cabiri,
in the island of Somothrace, are attributed to them also by Herodotus,{[ and he clearly
enough traces proofs of their being in Thrace; at the same time he is obliged to admit,
that a tribe of them, epuaa Hnuxa-yaw, entered Europe by the Hellespont," and of course in
boats. But the whole result of his diligent research proves, that the Greeks knew
nothing about them, but that if any thing can begleaned out of their discordant accounts,
it is, that one part of them came into Greece by land from Thrace, and that the other part

came
(qfier peopling the islands) by sea, and this certainly reconciles all the accounts;
though this is not observed by the Bishop. The etymology ofthe name Pelasgi he gives
up entire@, confessing that he cannot allow it to come from the Peleg of Genesis. That
they brought a
foreign language with them there can be no doubt; but it was, I think,
radically the same as that of the natives who came last from Thmce, in their wav from
the Hyperboreans, a mere variation of dialect which easily mixed with that of the natives,
and soon became lost as a
separate tongue. The same eH`eet took place with the religions
of these two patriarchal peoples-descending from the common ancestor. The people
ibund in Greece by the sailors and conquered by them, having the same Gods and speak.
ing a dialect of the same
language, might readily be called, many hundred years amp.
ward, by Herodotus, by the same name oi' Pelasgi!
In this short story we have the history of all the Pelasgic migrations of the ancients.
They were a
hardy, seafaring race, and soon subdued the Celtic inhabitants of Delphi in
Greece, or of Cuma in Italy,who, from their first quitting the parent hive, neverhad occasion
for an oB`ensive weapon except against wild beasts. These Pelasgi were Canaanites,1°
and were the people who settled Carthage, Gades, Spain, Ireland; and they are
only Nor
called Pelasgi in these latter places, because there were no Greek Herodotuses in those
countries, by their mistakes, to convert the term sailors into the name of a nation. But
if they escaped the effects of one mistake, they were the subjects of another-for the
writers of Ireland converted these very sailors Phaeni, or Pheni, or Phoenicians, into a
man, and christened him Phenius Farsaidh, or Phenius the Ancient; and, as he probably
brought one of the system of letters, they made him the inventor of them. From the
union of these circumstances it is, that we hear of the Pelasgi in all quarters, but can
lay hold of them nowhere. Gallmus has proved, in his Treatise on the Sybi/s, that the
Dorians were Pelasgi; that they came from the city of Dora, at the foot of Libanus in
Phcenicia; and that they had a settlement of some kind in Zealand, where their God, the
Hercules Magusanus, was found.
This fact of the Pelasgi being Dorians, Bishop Marsh has confirmed by his observation,
that, according to Herodotus, they spoke the Doric dialect.§ And I think it appears
from the Bishop's reasoning, as well as from the identity ofthe alphabets, that the Dorian
Pelasgi had the dialect of Cadmus, which would be the Bobeloth, and the Thra-
*
It is very probable, that the word Pelasgi may be foumd amongst the barbarians to whom so many other proper
names have been traced. Alter the honest admission by Plato and Herodotus, of their own
ignorance, no Greek or
Latin writer can be admitted aa conclusive evidence in opposition to a
theory confirmed by circumstances. Irdand
and Scotland were conquered bya people called by some authors Sea Kings. The mistake about the Pelasgi, IU
exactly similar to that which would be made, ifthese couqnerors were made into a nation mlled Seahiags.
1- The meaning of the word Canaan, Un kno-n, is merely amerehant or trader, an epithet applicable enough to the
people ofPhmnieia or Syria.

cian Pelasgi, the Ionian or Attic dialect, which would be the Beth-luis-nion,-the two
grand divisions into which Herodotus has reduced all the dialects of Greece.' The
Thracian Pelasgi were, in fact, Celte from the Hyperboreans, and were called Pelasgi
by Herodotus and later Greek authors, because they found them nearly the same in
letters, language, and religion, with the later comers, the sailors, their conquerors. They
all had the same patriarchal religion of Lithoi and stone circles, or of open temples and
grove worship.
The dialect of Cadmus is what Herodotus calls the -yum; Aasgixov-the Thracian the
yew; Imvu¢ov.1° It has been observed by Pezron, that the islanders were
always consi-
dered to be Dorians. Indeed, he supposes it not impossible that their name
might come
from the Greek word Aopu a
ship. This is absurd; but their being sailors, though from
what place he does not know, tends to prove them the same as the Pelasgiq;
Concerning Dora, which was near to Carmel, Bochart,Joshuaxii., I Chron. vii. 29, and
Judges i. 27, may be consulted. From Joshua it appears to have been on the sea-coast.
Mr. Davies has observed, (vide Chap. I. Sect. xxxi.,) that the Ionian alphabet accords
much better with that of the Hebrew and of the Western Asiatic in general, than Runic,
Irish, or Bardic: which last, in all other respects, appears to have been a
very near
ally
to the Pelasgian or Etruscan. This perhaps may be true. I do not pretend to say for a
certainly to which class I would put the Ionian. I still think it ought to go with the
Attic, but this no way affects the ground of my argument of the two languages or dialects,
and of their distribution.
Mr. Bryant observes, that the Athenians claimed to have colonized Ionia, and that
when they sent their first colony there the Muses went before them in the form of Bees,
Melissae.§ These traditions ofthe Ionians and inhabitants of Attica being originally the
same, strengthen my suspicion that the Ionian letters ought to be classed with the Attic,
and not with the Pelasgic or Dorian, as Mr. Davies imagined. 'Alter all, the difference
is only in words and not in facts.
If the reader will look to the map and consider the circumstances, he must think the
distribution of the people, which I have now made, more probable than if they were
divided according to the systems of letters stated in Chap. I. Sect. xi., li'om the Greek
authors, as
reported by Mr. Davies," he will think it much more
likely, that the old
Ionians, who gave name to the Ionian Sea, were the Aborigines, i. e.
Hyperboreans, and
the people of one dialect, and the Phmnicians, Cadmeans, Pelasgi, Dorians, &c., the sea»
faring people, the other. I will not give an
opinion upon the classilication of the
dialects of the other people of Greece, but I am
pretty certain that the Phoenician, the Cad-
mean, the Dorian, and the Pelasgic, properly so called, ought to be on one side, and the

Attic and Ionian on the other. It has been proved, that the Celtaa or
Hyperboreans did
come down into Greece, and that they tbunded the oracles, &c. If they were not these
Tbracian Pelasgi, what became of them P* The Bishop seems to prove for me all I wuld
wish, when he shews that, according to
many ancient authors, the Thraeiang exgendgd over
the Isther even to the country of the Scythians.
If the reader will consider that the Cimmerii or Celta had certainly a settlement on
the banks of the Palus Mo.=:otis_, called the Cimmerian Bosphorus, he will not think it
improbable that some of these people should have come
along the South side of the
Black Sea, about the same time that their countrymen advanced along the North bank
of it; and after leaving colonies in Lydia and Ionia, in Asia Minor, should have passed
into Thrace, and there joined their countrymen. This will account for the language
being called Ionian, and being the same as the Attic. I pay little attention to the Attic
colony, with its_fbbulous Muses or Melissa retuming back to the East.
The circumstance that Gallmus should prove for me most satisfactorily that the Pelas-
gic Dorians, or Dorian Pelasgi of Bishop Marsh, had a settlement in Zealand, is such a
confirmation of my hypothesis as cannot well be got over. And I think all the reason-
ing which has been applied to the Thracians, who had Corybantes and Curetes for their
priests, will apply to the Italian Umbrians and Etruscans, who had Curetes and Hirpins
tbr priests; for the Pelasgi are equally to be found, though not to so
great a degree, in
Italy as in Greece.
Herodotus, Pliny, and Paterculus, say, the Etrurians were a Lydian colony. I think
it probable that the same thing took place with the Etruscans in Italy that happened to
the occupiers of Greece and the Pelasgi. When the latter arrived, they would find
another tribe of a
very similar raoeof people, and would soon coalesce with them. We
must recollect that the old authors acknowledged their ignorance, so that they are no
authority againstany rational theory founded on our
superior knowledge ofthe geography
and history of the world, astronomy, &c.
The philosophers of Greece, in the time of I-Ierodotus, were, with respect to knowledge
of its early population, exactly in the same situation that Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Pin-
kerton are with respect to Scotland and Ireland, for, like Herodotus, they trouble them-
selves much about minute points and petty tribes, but never take an
enlarged view of
the whole.

both in the Bobeloth and the Beth-luis-nion. I now beg my reader to refer back to
Chapter V. Section xxvii., and consider what Gallaus has proved respecting the Do-
rians and the Syrian Hercules coming by the Pillars of Hercules, &c.; and I ask this
question, Might not the May-day festival of the Bull, the peculiar worship of Bacchus,
be brought to the British isles by the Celtae through Gaul; and the April lestival of the
Ram, the peculiar worship of Hercules, be brought by the PelasgiP
M. Dupuis has proved beyond all doubt, that the worship of Bacchus, the Baghis of
India, the Baal, Bel, Belenus, or Apollo, was the worship of the sun in Taurus. This
I suppose to have been the worship of the Celtm, who came to Britain through Gaul.
The worship of Hercules is also clearly proved by Mons. Dupuis to have been the sun
in Aries; and therefore, according to the precession of the equinoxes, receding a
degree
in 72 years, it must have been founded 2160 years a.fter the sun first entered Taurus.
In all the histories of the colonies coming to the pillars of Hercules, to Spain, to Zealand,
to Ireland, Hercules is the protecting god; thence I conclude that after the sun entered
Aries, some of these colonies of Pelasgi, from Sidon or Tyre, were the people who built
the pillars of Hercules: and successors of them might be the people who set up the
pillars at Tafyag, stated to have been set up by fugitives fiom Joshua, the robber, the son
of Nun; and they might also be the people who brought the festival of the first of
April to Britain! This seems to me to account for the April festival, to say the
least, in a manner not entirely inconsistent with probability.
Moses is stated to have lived about fifteen hundred years before the time of Christ.
If we suppose that the Dorian Pelasgi brought the worship of Hercules to the Western
world, of course it would not have been before the sun entered Aries. But this must
have taken place, reckoning by the real Zodiac, which is evidently the proper course,
4-300 years before the present time, or about 2500 years before the time ofChrist.1' This
gives them time enough to have come with their sixteen or seventeen letters-but before
the Asiatic alphabet of their countrymen increased to twenty-two letters, and before the
writing of the Pentateuch: and if the pillar, be it Lithos, Lingham, or Cromleh, i. e.
bowing-stone, were set up at Tangiers, it might readily be set up by some of the Canaan-

ites taking refuge amongst their countrymen. And if we look to the circumstances we
shall see
something very probable in all this, for Joshua was ordered to spare none.
Numbers might, and certainly would, take refuge in Sidon and Tyre, which were neither
of them able to make head against him, but neither of which he was able to conquer;
and after these two states were confined to their walls, they might readily receive their
distressed countrymen ; but not being able to give them habitations, might assist them
to migrate to unsettled countries.
Now in this migration to the Western world they might easily pass by land* across
the bottom of the Delta of Egypt, the territory ol' the enemies of Joshua and of their
allies, along the African coast, accompanied by a
Tyrian fleet all the way to the Straits of
Gibraltar, or to Tangiers, Tafyig. They might cross to Spain, from the nearest point of
which they might sail thence by detachments; and they might readily have set
up the
pillar, from the same
religious motive which caused the pillars of the Israelites, of
Hercules, and of Britain. Part of these fugitives might have gone to Zealand, part to
Ireland, part to Britain. If in the migration as far as
Tangiers, and even to Corunna,
they were accompanied along the shore by a Tyrian fleet, to convey provisions, heavy
baggage, and their sick, there never was a
large migration which would be so
easily
accomplishedsl' If we
suppose the African coast to have been already colonized, or
occupied by their countrymen, as we know that it was, the reason is very evident why
they did not stop, but continued their migration, and thus passed on, till they arrived
at Corunna, on the coast of the Celtiberian Gallicia, directly opposite to Cornwall.
Orosius, a writer of the fifth century, gives an account of a
very fine column or
pharos,
which tradition in his day said had been erected by Hercules, as a
guide to
ships
coming there from Britain. From this column the town of Corunna took its name.
' °
th S`d
There is every reason to believe that the sea-coast was possessed by e 1 onian race,
the whole way from Sidon to Corunna, with the exception perhaps of the Delta of
Egypt. Under these circumstances it is very evident that a
voyage to Britain must
have been very easy, with even very indifferent ships.
Col. Vallencey endeavours to trace the sailors who came to Ireland from a
country a
little to the North of the opening between the Black and Caspian Seas. It must be
evident that this brings them to be the Celtaa or their successors, and that they are the
very people I call Pelasgi or Canaanites. I do not pretend to trace them farther than to
the coast of Sidon or Tyre. All he says maybe perfectly true, and is perfectly con-
sistent with my idea of them, and with my hypothesis. He, Dr. Jamieson, Mr. Pin-
kerton, and Mr. O'Connor, all agree that their Scythians found people in these countries,
and conquered them. These people whom they found were the Celtaa, Gomerians, or
* Joshua did notat Em oonquerthe sea-com from Tyre to Gam; it remained in the possmion ofthe Philistine.

CURIOUS PROOFS OF THE TRUTH OF THE LAST, AND OF THE SECTION PRECEDING
IT.-CHAP. YI. SECT. XXXL
Now with respect to the supposed facts of the Pelasgi being from Phoenicia, and the
Etruscans being Pelasgi, the following extracts from Dr. Clark's Travels, seem to
establish them in a way which cannot be disputed.
Dr. Clark, at page 84 of Vol. IV., has given a coin which he says is evidently
Phoenician: on one side is an inscription in the Phoenician language, but in Etruscan
characters, which proves that the Phmnicians and Etruscans were the same people. On
the other side is a stone pillar, a Lithos. The following is acopy of the inscription:

°)"l"°r~|-|
He observes, that Leonhart Rauwolil in his itiner-any of the eastern countries, as pub-
lished by Ray, in 1698, (Part II. chap. xiii.,) calls the Druses of Mount Libanus by the
name of Trusci, (the priests of the Etruscans). These people now
speak the Arabie
language. Hyde calls them Ysideans, Curds, and Calbs; and Herodotus names a
people of Mount Libanus called AHPOTSIAIOI. See note in Chap III. Sect. viii., for
the Hebrew word U11 drs, a Druid.
Now here is certainly a very odd collection of names accidentally assembled together;
the Druses (or expounders, as Parkhurst calls V11 drs) of Herodotus; the Trusci, the
priests of the Etruscans; the Cards and Calbs, very like Curbs and Coarbs; and these
very, very ancient people, as I will immediately prove them to be, speaking the language
of Arabia, a country divided from them by Syria, Palestine, and extensive deserts-all
cuntous Pnoors or 'run raurn or 'ras t..s'r sz-:c'r.-case. vr. sacr. xxxr. 265
which, we know, have not spoken Arabic for three thousand years, but Samaritan,
Hebrew, and Syriac.
It is astonishing, in some cases, how long a superstition will last, though religions,
like every thing else, are
always changing. In Mount Libanus, amongst the people
named above, is still continued the same
superstition which was
given to the Israelites
by Aaron, of the adoration of a calf; with the very extraordinary and identical ceremonies
described in the 32d chapter and 6th verse of Exodus by the words surre.-rerun! ludere,
the meaning of which it is unnecessary to explain here: but the similar practice to which
maybe found explained in Dr. Clarke's Travels, Vol. IV. pp. 136, 204- ;* and which, taken
altogether, pretty well prove these Druses of Herodotus to be as old or older than Aaron.
Mr. Vallencey has pointed out a
very curious passage in Diogenes Laertius, where it
is said, that "
the Phoenician philosophers are called Ochos, but with the Celtse they are
called Druids: Hoxo; ¢s7.o¢ra¢o; mapa ¢ow|§|-araga -re Kawai; -ron; xaxoupsvoug Agundag."
He then labours to prove, that Ochus is the same as
Mogh, Mochus, Moch, or Muc,
a
philosopher or magus; and that Phenius Farsaith, the great hero of Irish story, had the
title of Ochus, and was the inventor of the Ogham alphabet, as well as that of the
Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Latins. It is necessary to observe, that it is said in the
Irish books that this Fenius Farsaith lived somewhere about Babylon, and brought a
grand colony to Ireland. The Colonel becomes a little angry with Mr. Toland for his
ignorance of this historicalfact.1'
When this passage of Diogenes Laertius is considered, in conjunction with what the
reader has just seen respecting the Drusii of Herodotus; and the other circumstances
named by Dr. Clarke, which are of such a kind that they cannot possibly have been pro-
duced by art or design, he must be struck with their extraordinary nature; and, if l
mistake not, his surprise will be increased by the following passage from Dr. Clarke,
respecting the Okkals, evidently the same race alluded to by Diogenes.
"
One class of the Druses are to the rest what the initiated are to the profane, and are
called Okkals, which means spiritualists; and they consider themselves superior to their
countrymen.; They have various degrees of initiation; the highest order practises celi-
bacy. They dwell chiefly near Sidon. Paul Lucas says,§ that they speak Arabic, but
their characters are
Syriac and Chaldaic." It is curious that they should speak the lan-
guage of the book of Job, but use the letters in which we now have it, viz. the Chaldee.
It is also curious that they should use the same
religious rites as those used by Aaron. It
is evident that they have a monastic order, and they are discovered by our travellers in
the country where the founder of the Carmelites or the Essenes lived. All these circum-

stances accidentally coming together, in a manner so totally unconnected, and which can
by no possibility have been the effect of design or art, carry conviction to my mind that
a most intimate relation has existed, in very remote times, between Sidon or
Tyre, and
Ireland. Circumstantial evidence of this kind is better than any written historical evi-
dence whatever. I beg my reader will consider all these things in conjunction with what
I have said about the Etrusci, the Pelasgi, and the Dorians, from this same
country,
which if he do, I think he must be convinced that they were all the same race of people.
Indeed, I think it may be said to be proved; for Bishop Marsh has proved the Pelasgi
to be Dorians; Dr. Clarke has proved the Etrusci to be Phoenicians, and Gallaeus has
proved the Dorians to be Phcnnicians. Thus the Pelasgi, the Etrusci, the Dorians, and
the Phmnicians, are all proved to be the same, and are found in Zealand.
I lately met with an assertion, that the book of Job was ancient Arabic, written in the
Chaldee character; now, I think, this may lead to
something interesting. It is almost
certain that Genesis, or the Pentateuch, cannot have been all of it in one
language or
dialect, when compiled by Moses. It appears that Joseph spoke to his brothers by
means of an interpreter, (notwithstanding what those may say who endeavour to
explain
away a
very plain text,) therefore they did not speak Egyptian. The language of the
tribe of Israel was not Assyrian or
Babylonian, because, when Jacob and Laban set up a
earn
they called it by different names; Jacob called it Galead, which differed from the
3n1'|nw 'ui igr seduta, which it was called by Laban, and which must have been Assy.
rian. Abraham and Isaac made treaties several times with the natives of Syria, and
Moses talked with his Ethiopic Arabian father-in-law; but we hear of no diihculties or
interpreters. From a consideration of all the circumstances, I suspect that the lan-
guage of the Israelitish shepherd tribe was the language of the shepherd Arabians, and
of the book of Job. It is very certain that the Pentateuch must have been in diE`erent
dialects, and reduced into the Samaritan and Hebrew!
I suspect it will turn out, when the question is carefiilly examined byan Oriental
scholar, whose mind shall be unfettered by nonsensical superstitious, prejudice, or in-
terest, that the ancient Celtic, and the ancient Arabian, in which the book of Job was
written, will have been the same
spoken languages, and that they were the languages, in
all probability, which the persons used who lived the first after the flood,-and that from
them sprung all the others, both spoken and written. By a carefirl examination of the
languages, upon the principle on which I have proceeded, I can feel no doubt that a
good Oriental scholar would easily ascertain whether all the written languages proceeded
from one or not. If they appear to have proceeded from one, I should then say, it was
clearlyantediluvian; if there be several systems, I should be inclined to think them post-
diluvian; and that the antediluvians had not the knowledge of letters, but only of figures,

In this there is nothing against their consisting of great nations. How magnificent
and polished a nation were the Mexicans! but they had no letters.
It seems to me that a
consequence follows tiom the assertion, that the British or Irish
were Celtae, and that the Celtae were Cimmerians or
Gomerians, which is very curious,
and has not had the attention paid to it which it deserves. Gomer was the son of one of
the first men who escaped from the flood; and whether these men were saved on the
East or the West of the Caspian Sea, the Celtic must have been the language used by
them.
In my reading, some time ago, I rnet with an observation, that a German, of (I think)
the name of Skrekio, had published a book to prove that the Celtic was the language of
Adam. I paid no attention to a doctrine which I thought so ridiculous, but if I could
now find the book, or the reference to it, I should not treat either of them with so much
disrespect. I should like very much to see how he arrived at that conclusion.
The evidence of all antiquity is decidedly in favour of what I have advanced, and can-
not be got over, except as a learned and ingenious friend gets over it in Rees's Cyclo-
paedia, by passing over the best ancient authorities with the words, obscure quotations
_ji-om ancient authors? He accuses Pezron, Pelloutier, Davies, &c., of considering the
word Celtae as the generic name ofa great people. In this he is perfectly correct. They
have so considered it, and in so
considering it, they have considered it rightly, and their
view cannot be overturned till all the obscure quotations from ancient authors, such as
Plato, Aristotle, &c., are abandoned.
To say that any of those tribes alluded to are not Celta, is as much as to say, that the
tribe of Cambells or
M'Gregors are not Scotch. The Celtm and Scythians might be
the same people at diferent times. They constituted a
genus, the Cimbri, Etrusci, Picti,
Src., might be called species. All the writers on these subjects seem to forget that these
tribes are spread through a
space of many thousand years. According to all ancient his-
torians, they were first Gomerians; a thousand years afterward they might be Scythians.
They were then, perhaps, Parthians, then Huns and Goths, then Tartars, and conquered
China. By and by they will be heard of again. They are not dead. The same causes
will, probably, produce the same effects. They are now uncivilized, and have been so
for many thousand years. When they were first settled in Bactriana they were the most
enlightened of mankind, the founders of the Arabic, Sanscrit, &c.-the people, so beau-
titiilly described by Haiis and the Persian poets, as
residing in the most delightful of
climates and the most beautiful of cities, Samsncasn. I feel a
perfect conviction that
it would be possible to demonstrate that the Arabic is the mother of all the Westem lan-
guages, or is own sister to the Celtic, and both daughters ot' one deceased mother.

OBSERVATIONS ON HEBREW' CHRONOLOGY.-CRAP. VI. SECT. XXXII.
Mr. Volney is one of the most able of all chronologers: after the exertion of great
ingenuity and learning he can carry authentic chronology no higher than Cyrus, before
whom, all is doubt and dimculty. There may have been people of the names of Semina-
mis or Sesostris, but their histories are involved in contradictions of various kinds.
I think it impossible for any one to read the previous part of this chapter and not see,
that the customs of the Israelites and the Druids, with their stone circles and pillars, &c.,
were the same. Then it will be asked, Do you take them for Jews? To which I reply,
Their language, and that of all the earth, was
nearly the same, and the same patriarchal
customs universally prevailed. The worship of the Bull in Taurus, found every where,
had become the religion before the colonies left the parent state, and travelled with them.
The Patriarch Abraham was, probably, the lirst man-first great philosopher, who en-
deavoured to stop this corruption, (leaving his father's house on this account,) in which he
was succeeded by Moses, who destroyed the Bull made by Aaron, when he and the
Israelites, from fear, attempted to desert the religion of their ancestor, and to have recourse
to that of the neighbouring nations. I see
nothing against this except the length of time
required previous to the reputed :era of Moses; but I hope this will no
longer form an
obstacle: if it do, recourse must then be had to the hypothesis of Mr. Maurice, and the
Tauric worship must be brought into the religion. On this subject every one must please
himselti For my own part, I can neither admit the Bull of the Zodiac, nor the Apis
destroyed by Moses, to be amalgamated with my Christianity, which is a
religion of rea-
son, or it is nothing. Christian priests will do wisely to consider well the consequences
which now
inevitably follow from persisting in making their religion responsible for
systems of chronology. The Tauric festival can neither be _got rid of nor disguised;
the proofs of its date and of its existence are innumerable and incontrovertible. I advise
them to take example from the Rev. Mr. Davies, (vide Chap. II. Sect. v. of this work,)
from the Rev.M r. Maurice, (vide Chap. V. Sect. i. and vi.,) irom the Rev. Mr. Faber,
(vide Chap. IV. Sect. xii.,) and no
longer permit their religious prejudices to be a hin-
drance to science.
I beg leave to ask the serious, thinking, and dispassionate Christian, how, if his religion
be tacked to the chronology, it is to exist a
single moment in the teeth of the Tauric
festival?
CONSIDERATION OP CIRCULAR TEBIPLES C0NCLUDED.1CHAP. YI. SECT. XXXIII.
We must now return to the consideration of the circular temples of the Druids, but I
hope the digression which we have made, ifit be a
digression, will not be thought irrele-
vant or have proved uninteresting.
cousrnaaarroar or cracnnaa ramrnss corrcnnnan.-sxcr. xxxrrr. 269
It is not reasonable to expect from the dislocated masses gf mins whi¢h are left to us,
that we shall ever be able to make out in detail the secrets of these magical temples, which
when first planned, were, I have no doubt, intended to be involved in mystery. I should
most unwisely injure my cause, if I pretended to make out from ruins as a
certainty,
what was intended to be hid in secrecy, when the originals of those ruins were unim-
paired. All that I contend for is, that enough is sliewn to prove, that their builders were
acquainted with the ancient cycles and made allusion to them in some way or other. It
must be recollected that I am not only working against the secrets of the Druids, but
also against the labours of their enemies for thousands of years, to destroy all remains
of those secrets.
It is proper to observe before I proceed further, that Dr. Stukeley has flattered himself;
that, by a
comparison of the dimension of these temples, he discovered the proportion
which the ancient cubit bore to the English foot. His reasoning is very ingenious, as his
reasoning always is, butl think his system is open to many objections. I have, therefore,
not troubled my reader upon this subject. If I adopted his theory, nothing could be
more completely in favour of what I have said, as the numbers of his cubits agree in a
remarkable manner with the numbers of years in some of the cycles. What he says may
be perfectly true, but I think it is yet attended with considerable diiiiculty.
He says, speaking of the temple at Rowldrich in Oxfordshire, "
In a letter from Mr.
Roger Gale to me, dated from Worcester, Aug. 19, 1719, having been to visit this
antiquity at my request, he tells me, the diameter of the circle is 35 So the
Bishop of London writes, the distance at Stonehenge from the entrance of the area to the
temple itselfis 85 yards: so the diameter of Stonehenge is 85 yards. We suppose this
is not measured with a mathematical exactness; but when we look into the comparative
scale of English feet and cubits, we discern 60 cubits of the Druids is the measure sought
tbr. The diameter of the outer circle of Stonehenge and this circle at Rowldrich are
exactly equal."'° I confess this coincidence of these temples with one another, and with
the curious number of 60, tends to give me a much better opinion of the Doctor's theories
of admeasurement than I should otherwise have. It almost induces me to think, that
they may be founded in truth.
It seems to be the general opinion of ingenious men, that the temple at Abury is
olderthan that at Stonehengesl' This consequence they deduce from the greater rude-
ness of the stones of which it is formed. I tear that no certain conclusion can be drawn
from this. I think that Mr. Waltire's calculation from the deviation of the line of the
axis of the circles of 75 degrees from the point where the sun rose in Taurus at the

270 CONSIDERATION OF CIRCULAB. TEMPLES CONCLUDED.-SECT. XXXIII.
vernal equinox, which brings out the date to be 3600 years before Christ, is of all the
diH`erent theories the most probable.
I beg my reader to recollect what has been said before respecting the worship of the
sun in Taurus, its prevalence in these islands and in Gaul, and I think he will agree
with me, that it is a circumstance strongly confirmative of the probable truth of Mr.
Waltire's supposition, and of the great age of Stonehenge. In short, that it was the
work of the same aera with the caves and Cromlehs in India, the pyramids of Egypt, and
the stupendous monument at Carnac, a monument which, for the immensity of labour,
must have left even the pyramids at a distance. When I consider all the circumstances
of the system of letters-the Tauric festival, and the general character of these temples,
I cannot separate them. However, as this is a
thing which is incapable of demonstra-
tion, every person must form his judgment as to him seems most proper.

CHAPTER VII.
HIERARCHY OF THE DRUIDS._SECT. I.
THE priesthood ofthe Celtic nations, called in Gaul and Britain Druids, was divided
into three orders of men, Druids, Bards, and Eubages or Vates. The first was the
men of highest rank and authority, the Bards the second, and the Eubages, Vates, or
Prophets, the third. These bear a
strong similitude to the hierarchy of the Jews, but
the order of the three ranks does not seem to be the same. The Jews had their Priests,
their Levites, and their Prophets. The Levites of the Jews answer to the Bards, but
272 Hrsnancuv or 'ran naurns.-CHAP. vrr. sect. 1.
the Prophets do not answer to the Eubages-for they certainly in the Jewish hierarchy
took the precedence of the Levites. The Jewish prophets seem to have been a
regular
order, and to have had colleges or monasteries, or something answering to the modern
institutions of that kind. We read of them in considerable numbers at a time, and they
were inducted into their oHice by the ceremony of anointing with oil; fi-om this it is
pretty clear that they were a
regular order. We read in the sixth chapter of Numbers
a
variety of laws for the regulation of Nazarites. These men, were, in my opinion the
persons afterward called prophets, and they are the persons whom the Roman church
considers the originals of their orders of Monks, particularly of the order of the Car-
melites. I quite agree with the Roman church in this point; and I think that the
prophets ot' the old Jews are to be found again in the Essenes of Philo and Josephus,
who were, in tact, the Carmelites who turned Christians. Having already noticed this
subject, I shall say no more
respecting them, as I am not treating of the Jews but the
Druids; and the field with respect to the former is very wide and extremely curious; but
it would require a treatise to itselll
The constitution of the order of Druids was in some
respects like that ofthe monastic
orders. One general of the order, as he might be called, in each country, was at the
head of them, and with him all authority in the order rested. Although the Gallic
Druids were in the habit of sending their youth to Britain for education, and of requiring
from its seminaries information upon difficult points, there is no evidence to
justifya
belief that the Arch-druid of Britain possessed any authority out of his own
country,
like that ofthe Pope, or of the Lama of Tibet. It is said by some authors that the order
in Britain was
governed by twenty-five llamens, over whom were
placed three arch-
flamensd' This is disputed by Dr. Borlase: it does not seem
very easy to determine
the question, nor is it very important. However, as the Doctor justly observes, there is
authority enough to remove all doubt of the existence of an annual assembly for the
administration of justice in Gaul; and it is not very probable that Britain, to which, as
we have seen the Gauls looked up as a
pattern, should have been without a similar in-
stitution. Czesar states this assembly to have been held in the middle of Gaul, in the
country of the Carnutes, between the rivers Loire and Seine, where they approach
nearest to each other. Here there was a
place consecrated to that purpose, to which all
persons having controversies, which could not be otherwise decided, came to have them
determined. When it is considered that these countries were divided into separate,
independent principalities, tribes, or clans, this assembly looks very like the assembly of
the Amphictyons of Greece: it has very little of the character belonging to a nation of
uncivilized barbarians. There are said to be some remains in the country between die
Loire and Seine, where it is supposed the meetings of this assembly were held, but they
are
very trifling, if they be genuine. Dr. Borlase infers from this Gallic institution, that

there must have been one similar in Britain; but of this, as I have just observed, there
is no positive evidence.
Mr. Rowland has observed, that the travelling of Samuel* every year to Bethel, Gilgal,
and Mispeh, to judge Israel, is an exact prototype of the Druids meeting once a
year in
a central part of Gaul to judge the people, as described by Ctesar.'|'
Dr. Borlase says,
"
When we are therefore inquiring into the antiquity of Druidism,
it is into the antiquity of that religious sect, that order of priests and philosophers, and
not into the antiquity of their religion, which in the principal parts is certainly as old as
the first idolatry."1' I cannot think that the priests can be separated from the religion.
There is not the least evidence to justify such separation. As is the case with all orders
of priesthood, they rose with the religion ; with it they flourished, and with it decayed.
In the works of the Greek historians we
constantly read of oracles being settled by
Hyperboreans, or of communications of some kind or other from them. Now I appre-
hend I have proved, that by these Hyperboreans were
generally meant the swarms from
the Oriental hive residing to the North of Greece, Italy, &c.; or
passing along to the
West, and finally remaining in Gaul, Britain, or
Germany: and amongst these tribes no
doubt the worshipers of Iou, and the other gods adopted by the Greeks, had their priests,
and these priests were the predecessors or ancestors of the Druids of Caesar's time; so
that to pretend, as Dr. Borlase does, that because we have no historical record of their
having been established any where else, they must have arisen or been established first
in Britain, is a
theory without any solid foundation, and contrary to all probability.
That they became more methodically arranged or
organized, is very possible, indeed is
very certain ; but this is no evidence of the order being first invented or instituted here.
All orders and institutions of this kind are the produce of accident and circumstance,
of a concatenation of small favourable events, uniting to produce the great effect. Dr.
Borlase has very truly observed, that the omission of the Greeks, when speaking ad-
vantageously of them, to claim them as their imitators, suiiiciently proves that they had
no
pretensions to them. If there had been the semblance of probability for such a claim,
Grecian vanity would not have permitted it to escape. Certainly various passages of
Caesar, the best witness, prove that the order was here in its highest state of perfection
and prosperity. He says, "Disciplina in Britannia reperta, atque in Galliam trans-
lata esse existimatur." This is no doubt in favour of the argument of Dr. Borlase; and
if it were originally instituted either in Gaul or Britain, the latter would have the best
pretension to it. Caesar also says, that the institution of the Druids was maintained
with greater strictness and purity in Britain than in Gaul, and that when the Gauls were
at a loss in any point relating to their discipline, their custom was to go over to Britain
tbr information. From all this it is apparent that, in the time of Caesar, the great

metropolis of the Druids was Britain. It was probably, in this respect, something like
the Rome or Tibet of the West of Europe, and this the remains of its gigantic establish-
ments tend strongly to confirm.
THE DRUIDS OBTAINED THE CHIEF POWER.-CHAP. VII. SECT. II.
From Cmsar we learn, that in Britain they had obtained, in a
very high degree, what
all priests attempt in every state; that is, the controul of the civil power and the posses-
'
f ll real authority
*
This is no reflection on individual priests; it is a
necessary
sion o a .
consequence of a
privileged order organized like a
priesthood. The same spirit always
has accompanied such a state of things, and always will accompany it. Caesar says,
"
There were two sorts of nobles in Britain, the one sacred, the other civil, or rather
military; for most of their civil disputes were decided by the Druids. The first order
of the British nobility was that of the Druids, the second that of the Equites. The
presence of the Druids was necessary in all acts of devotion."
They had not only the regulation of all matters relating to religion, but they engrossed
to themselves the adjudication of all disputes and the administration of criminal justice.1'
Farther even than this, they are represented as being the judges of merit and the distri-
butors of rewards. The mode by which they succeeded in obtaining this overgrown
ower is ve evident Their power ofexcommunication gave them the whole. If any one
P VY -
fell under their displeasure, he was excommunicated, by which he was excluded from the
us and detestable was
shunned.by all his country-
sacriiices, and being looked on as impio
men as a man infected by the plague. As divination constituted a great part of the
religion of the times, and no observation could be taken but by them, they had, by this
means, the complete controul of the government; no important aB`air could be under-
f h th d' ved
taken except with their consent and approbation. For, o course, w en

es should be unfavourable, and then nothing

cou .
lived in luxury and in as much splendour as the manners of the times admitted.
From Dion Chrysostorn we learn, that they were attended in the performance of their
judicial functions with great magnificence, sitting on thrones of gold; and that they
were accustomed to be most sumptuously entertained in the residences of the sovereigns
of the country.
In order to obtain and to retain, for any length oi' time, this power, their conduct must

Strabo, lib. iv. says, that it was a general opinion that the greater number ofDn|ids there were in a country, the
greater would be their harvests and the abundance of all things.
1' Gnorrus, de Jura Belli et Pacis, II. cap. xxxiii. says, that our Christian bishops derived their authority in their
ecclaiastical courts from the imitated power of the Druids.

in general have been good, and there is reason to believe that they were often the pacifi-
cators of the civil wars of their countrymen, having been known to step in between the
two parties drawn up for battle, and to have effected a reconciliation. It is not impro-
bable, as
corrupt as the Roman Papacy became in the dark ages of Christianity, that the
popes and bishops, if they often caused dissensions, also often succeeded in allaying them,
and, like the Druids, probably arrived at the acquisition of their enormous power, in part,
by standing in the gap between the tyranny of princes and the sufferings of the people.
It is generally by conduct of this kind, that priests have acquired power, which once
obtained is usually abused, and thus usually, by its abuse, it is lost. It is a
map of
human nature; it is nothing new or extraordinary.
I have stated, that the Eubages or prophets were the third order, but this is not univer-
sally allowed. Mr. Rowland thinks they were the second; if this were the fact, they
would then answer to the Jews in a manner which seems to me to be surprisingly near.
The Levites were
particularly employed as singers. This every one knows was the great
occupation of the Bards. The Levites I conceive also exactly answer to the Bards, in
being employed to record the transactions ofthe state.
The prophets of the Druids foretold tirture events and settled the times of the festivals,
which theyascertained from their knowledgeofmagicand astrology. When the order became
extinct, these men dwindled down into mere charlatans, and may be probably found in the
present Dervises of the East. The third order was of the first consequence in the state,
and sometimes, like the Melchizedek of the Jews, united both priest and king. This was
the case with Divitiacus, the Gaulish king of the Edui, the li°iend and ally of Cesar.
When the two offices of chief Druid and King were not united, they had an Arch-druid like
the Archimagus of the Persians and the Jewish Chief-priest. He sometimes succeeded to
his situation by the election of his fellows; but in general the order was
hereditary, like
the priesthood of the Jews. They were exempt from all burthensome civil offices, and
from all military duties, except that sometimes, on occasions of great emergency, the Arch-
druid commanded the armies of his country. They were looked up to with the most
profound veneration, and the persons of the chiefs of the order were held sacred, so
that their power was enormous; and at times when they chose to exercise it, they domi-
neered over both people and kings. The effect of the power of excommunication which
they possessed, was attended, as it was observed before, with consequences to the hill as
extensive as those of the excommunication of the Roman Church in the utmost plenitude
of its power-a power which, in fact, laid all orders of the state prostrate at their feet.
The Welsh have subdivided the Druids into several other orders, but I think with Dr.
Borlase, that this is only what we
may call a modern invention.

THE DRUIDS THE ASSERTORS OF THEIR. COUN'.'l`RY'S LIBERTY.-CHAP. VII.
SECT. III.
The Druids were the most strenuous assertors of their country's liberty (in which their
own power was intimately blended and united) against the Romans, constantly exciting
their countrymen, after every defeat, to fresh insurrections. This was the true reason
wh the were, in a
particular manner, sought after by the Romans, and put to the
.Y Y
sword wherever they could be taken. So determined were they, that neither by Romans,
Saxons, Danes, nor Normans, could they ever be conquered either in Britain or Ire-
land; but as
they could not successfully resist the overwhelming numbers and superior
discipline of their enemies in the plain country, they retreated, with the highest spirited
and most intractible of their countrymen, into the mountains of Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland, where they successfully deiied the legions of the Roman and Saxon barbarians.
It was not until the insidious arts of the Christian priests had destroyed their influence
and unnerved the arms of their gallant followers, that they could be tamed. For more
°
f
than a thousand years they maintained their country's independence in the mountains o
Wales and Scotland, whence they constantly made incursions upon their enemies. Here
it was where with their native, wild, and beautiful music, and ln
poetry, which would

CELTE AND DRUIDS IN GERMANY.-CHAP. VII. SECT. IV.
Dr Borlase is of opinion, that there were no Druids any where but in Gaul and
Britain; and he draws this conclusion, because they are no where proved to have ex-
isted. This is not, in a case like this, a fair conclusion. There were, no doubt, many

facts relating to the ancients which have not been handed down to us, which, there ore,

but merely for accidental circumstances. For instance, the Magusan ercu e
never have been known, if a tablet, with an inscription, had not been found in Belgium.
CELTE AND DRUIDS IN' GERMANY.-Cl-IAP. VII. SECT. IV. 277
The Druids were, in fact, only priests; in general character the same as all other priests
throughout the world: Bramins in India, Magi in Persia, 'Ieprsg in Greece, Sacerdotes in
D
Italy. Nor, because the letters which constitute the name are different in diH`erent lan-
guages, will there be any difference in the fact-in the nature of the thing itselfl With all,
the adoration of the Supreme Being was the primary object, although the circumstances
in each were diE`erent. This was an eH`ect which must
necessarily take place from the
vast variety of accidents to which each branch was liable, when it became separated from
the parent stock by rivers, mountains, seas, and long periods of time. It has been
thought that there were no Druids in Germany. Caesar has clearly said so; and I shall
be told that I must not be permitted to take him as an
irreproachable witness when it
suits me, and cast him off when he does not serve
my purpose: and this is quite fair.
But let us examine this evidence of Ca=.:sar's. I am of opinion that his evidence is as
good, in its nature in general, as that of any individual can be; but there never was an
individual who was not liable to error and mistake. And it must be recollected, that
Casar was not giving evidence in a court of justice, or in any manner in which great
care and precision were necessary. When he tells his countrymen that there were Druids
in Britain, and that there were no Druids in Germany, he was
evidently relating circum-
stances the truth or falsity of which at that time could be of very little consequence. No
doubt he meant to speak the truth, but he probably would not take much trouble on the
subject. If the Druids of Germany retired from the seat of war, or had not their esta-
blishments where it happened to take place, he might readily be deceived. Tacitus has
been thought to contradict Caesar. The latter says, that the Germans had no Druids;
'
bl
the former, that they had priests: Dr. Borlase has taken much 'unnecessary trou e to
ncile the two by explaining that they had priests, but not Druids. The whole ques-
reco ,,
tion is of no value; and if it were, it never could be satisfactorily determined. The
admission of Dr. Borlase is quite suilicient. He says,
e Germans had no Druids-although that order of
"
But the truth of it is, although th
riests was not established among them, and consequently their religion wanted many
P
superstitious ceremonies, and much of that erudition in idolatry which the authority,
learning and invention of that priesthood had introduced into Britain and Gaul, yet the
l'
`
al
f the Germans was in the jimdamentals, one and the same with that of the
re igion o ,
Gauls and Britons. Their principal deity was
Mercury; they sacrificed human victims;
they had open temples, and no idols of human shape; they consecrated groves, wor-
shiped oaks, were fond of the auspicial rites, computed by nights, not by days."'
But although Caesar says they had neither priests nor sacrifices, he does not deny them
religion; for he expressly saysf that they worshiped the sun, moon, and fire.
This is quite suilicient; whether the priests and priesthoods were a little better organ.

ized in one place than the other will make no difference: they were in fact all the same;
and I have no doubt that a
very intimate relation, and probably correspondence, existed
in those days amongst the priests, of whom the Druids were a
part, from India to Thule!
ents on both sides, and considering the circumstances of
the remains of temples, of language and names of countries, and in short all the evidence
as well as I am able, I think the difhculty seems
capable of very easy solution. In the
greatest part of upper and middle Germany, into which the Celta had never penetrated,
or at least where they had never made settlements, as Caesar says there were no Druids,
but in the lower parts, wherever the Celtae had established themselves, the remains oi' them
are to be found-and in these countries in greater or less power, according to circum-
stances. In some, indeed in most of them, what might be called the Gothic or Teutonic
sect of the religion almost entirely superseded them; and as
may well be expected, in none
would they have the same
paramount authorityas in Britain, where foreign conquerors and
foreign priests had not much interfered with them. It must he recollected that amongst
the ancients the religious generally eicercised a
great degree of toleration of one another;
(there was
nothing like our sectarian bitterness ;) an eH`ect arising from their being all
at the bottom worshipers of the sun, for the most part as the Shekinah of the Supreme
Being. The principal exception is to be found in the Iconoclasts of Persia; but
probably at the times of which I am now
speaking, these nations had not proceeded
beyond the stone pillar and the circle, even if they acquired graven images afterward,
as we must suppose some of them did, from the expression of Caasar,1'
"
Deum maxime
Mercurium colunt: Hujus sunt plurima simulacra."
It is not improbable that the Teutonic priests, when conquering a
country, might
admit the Celtic Druids whom they found, into their system, in an inferior rank to them-
selves, adopting the use of their ready~built temples. This may account for Druid
temples and Druid rites without Druids.
Many persons have maintained that the Germans were Celtaa, because they find traces
of them in some
parts of Germany; but what says Cmsar?'}_' That, in former times,

priesthood equally dignified and learned in all."' In fact it is evident that they were
the same patriarchal order of priesthood in Gaul and Gennany, with some trifling
variations, which had been produced by the change of circumstances in long periods of
years, many of which have been pointed out in the course of this work. The Curetes or
Hirpins in Italy, shew that this religion was the religion of the Celtae, previous to their
arrival in Britain. The difference is merely in the form of a word; in Persia he was
Arch-magus; in Judea High-priest; and in Britain Arch-druid. There can be no doubt,
I think, that amongst the Greek and Roman writers they were spoken of precisely in
the loose way in which our similar order is spoken of; who are called priests, clergy,
parsons, 8cc. Thus we read of Druids, Saronides, Courbs, Corybantes, Curetes, Cul-
dees, Magi-not differing so much probably as our orders of the same genus of men at
the present day in Greece, Rome, and England; and in the same manner they would
be more enlightened in some countries than in others. I think it is not unlikely that
the British and Irish Druids might rank with the first.
Dr. Borlase maintains that the religious tenets and ceremonies which we find in Ger-
many were common to all the North of Europe, and consequently to the Druids; but
that the converse is not true-the tenets and ceremonies of the Druids were not common
to them; that what we find recorded of the Druids can by no means be asserted of the
Germans and northern nations: in some trifling particulars perhaps not. He says,
"
The Druids built much upon, and improved the Celtic plan, added science and con-
templation, separated themselves into a distinct and noble order, held annual councils
about sacred things, refined the plain, homely rites of their forefathers, and carried the
erudition of their mysteries to a
height unknown to nations invariably retentive (as the
Germans were) of their first simplicity; content to make war and hunting the principal
aim of their lives-affording to religion, arts, and speculation, but a small, if any, portion
of their time and thoughts." All this is mere idle theory, arisingfrom the doctor's wish to
make the Druids an order of enlightened saints, and then appropriate them to Cornwall,
as the Irish do to Ireland, and the Scotch to their Islands. The simple fact is, the
men were warriors and hunters, and the priests men of peace, eating the venison, and
generally receiving, when taken, the tithes of the spoils of war-let who would be
victor, profiting by the brawl.
Dr. Borlase wishes to draw a line of distinction between the Druids and the religion,
and thus to pave the way for the opportunity of giving Britain, perhaps Comwall, the
honour of being the' first parent of Druidism. The striking marks of similarity so
evident in all the rites and ceremonies, the festivals, &c., Sac., between the Eastem
nations and those of the Druids, sufficiently prove their common and simultaneous
origin. How can the Tauric festival of the Naurutz be supposed to have been esta-
'
Borlase, p. 71.
Dnnrns SUPERINTEND 'ri-rs EDUCATION or Yourn.-cusp. vu. sr-:c'r. vx. 28l
blished, if there had not been from the earliest time an order of priests to preserve it, and
bring it and its appurtenances along with the wandering tribes? All that can be said
is, that the oldest writers, and perhaps Aristotle' is the oldest, speak of them as an 9|-der
of the most remote antiquity in their time.1'
Dr. Borlase admits that it is a vain attempt to fix the :era of their antiquity; but he
says, that "
if they had really been Celtic priests, they would have spread with the several
divisions ofthat mighty nation, and their traces would have been found equally strong and
lively in every country where the Celta settled; but that we have no warrant from
history to suppose this priesthood settled any where but in Gaul and Britain." Because
we have no
history, it does not therefore follow that they did not exist. But their doc-
trines and festivals are found in every country. The traces of them are found stronger
in the British isles than any where else, because, probably in consequence of the
secluded situation, after being once brought there, they were less disturbed by con-
quests and revolutions of various kinds. Have we not found their festivals in India,
their circular temples in Judea, their rites at Delphi and Soracte? In short, have we
not found them every where?
nnurns SUPEBINTEND THE EDUCATION' OF YOUTH.-CHIP. VII. SECT. YI.
In all ages and nations priests have been well aware of the influence of education.
We need not, therefore, be surprised to 'mind the Druids seizing possession of this
powerfiil engine. No persons were
permitted to have any share in the public employ-
ments who had not been educated in their establishments. It is not therefore an extra»
ordinary thing that persons of the higher classes of society should be desirous of sending
their children to them to be educated, and of having them admitted into the order. It
has been thought that institutions of the nature of monasteries or colleges may be per..
ceived amongst them. "
Academia amplissima existimatur tiiisse in sylva Carnotensi,
eo loco ubi nunc urbs a Druidibus nuncupata Gallicé Dreux, et in Pagis sylva: vicinis

But Ammianus MarceIlinus§ has a
passage much more important on
many accounm:
"
Druides ingeniis celsiores (ut authoritas Pythagoraa decrevit) sodalitiis astricti con-
sortiisque, quaestionibus occultarum rerum altarumque erecti sunt, et, despectantes
humana, pronunciarunt Animas immortales." Dr. Borlase truly observes that it is
diliicult to imagine how they could educate youth on any large scale without some
institution of the kind.

282 DRUIDS SUPERINTEND THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH._'CH. VII. SECT. VI.
The youths whom the Druids educated are said to have been taken to the most se~
eluded situations, to caves, or woods, or rocky carns, and their education not to have
been completed in less than twenty years." All this applies evidently to young Druids
educated for particular purposes, probably those of the Bardic order, of whom we are
told it was required that they should learn to repeat twenty thousand verses before their
education was complete. Children of this description were not permitted to have any
intercourse with their parents till they were turned fourteen years of age. This was
evidently good policy to attach them to the order, and to prevent the influence of natural
affection from interfering with its interest. It would not admit a divided empire over
the minds of its members. This is the policy of all monastic institutions. A good
Monk has but one object in the world-rn:-: onnsn. To this, too often, every principle
is sacrificed. The practice of committing their doctrines to
memory is very similarto
that of the Pythagoreans, and, unfortunately, to that of most of the other ancient philo-
sophers. It is to this pernicious and unprincipled desire of monopolising power, that
the loss of their learning is to be attributed. Feeling that knowledge is power, they
wished to keep all knowledge to themselves.
Numa is said to have ordered his sacred books and writings to be buried with him.
Pythagoras was an Essenian philosopher. It is not surprising that he should have
followed the monastic practice. In consequence of this pernicious system, Porphyry
tells us that when the disciples of Pythagoras perished, during the Metapontine tumults,
the discipline and science of that philosopher expired for the most part with them,1' for
their memories were the only repositories in which they had preserved those treasures ot'
knowledge which their great founder had left them. The same
thing happened in Egypt
when Camhyses destroyed the temples of the Egyptians 1' Much of the practical part ot
the religion of the Druids consisted of songs or hymns, which they sung to their harps.
In this again we are reminded of the Israelites. Of these verses some remains are sup-
posed to be yet in existence amongst the bardic songs of the Cornish, the Welsh, and
the Scottish harpers. In their discipline they are represented to have been exceedingly
strict, and that it was a maxim, that all fathers of families were esteemed as
kings in their
family, having power of life and death over wives, children, and slaves. This is again
very like the patriarchal discipline of the Israelites.
Mr. Davies remarks, that "
Amongst other nations, the dispersed and scattered
members of the system appear as fragments of high antiquity, in terms, customs, and
superstitious; but its fundamental principles of remote antiquity were either forgotten,
or locked up amongst the mysteries of the sacred orders. The secrets of the Magi, the

Orpheans, the priests ofthe Cabiri, and of Egypt, perished with each of their ingtiruti¢n3_
We cannot, therefore, expect from Greece and Rome, and rnufgh less fl-gm the sam-ed
volume, a complete elucidation of their arcana. But, abating for some insramges 0f10¢a|
improvements and corruptions, we may at once pronounce the Druids to have been of
the same class. The discipline they enforced, the sciences they taught, and the opinions
they inculcated, were in general the same. The source from whence they had professed
uniformly to have derived them was the same; viz., from the slay: qf Dylan, the son oi'
the sea, who survived, with his single family, when the world was drowned." That is
to say, if this learned gentleman's whimsical theory about the ship be left out, from the
first persons who escaped from the effects of the deluge.
In the doctrines ot' the Druids a wonderful similarity seems to have existed between
them and those ol' the Magi of Persia, which was so
strong in the case of magic, as to
induce Pliny to observe, that in his day Britain celebrated the magic rites with so
many
similar ceremonies, that its natives might be taken for Persiansfl' Their reverence
ibr fire, their hatred of images, and of temples closed at the top, are
precisely the
same as the doctrines of the Magi, as well as many other of their doctrines.
IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND METEMPSYCHOSIS.--CHAP. VII. SECT. VXI.
The Druids were not of the Epicurean school, but were firm believers in a
Supreme
Being, as I have shewn in a former part of this work, and in general held the doctrines
of Pvtha ras. They believed in a fixture state of rewards and punishments-in the im-
. 5°
mortality of the soul, and in the metempsychosis, or the soul's transmigration after death
from one body to another.:
Of the vast variety of religious opinions which have prevailed at different times in the
world, perhaps there is no one that has been more general than that of the Metempsy-
chosis. There was scarcelya country or a sect, in former times, in which traces of nt may
not be found. It was received by the Bramins, the Magi of Persia, and by numbers of
the Greeks and Latins; by the followers of Pythagoras generally, and by the Pharisees,
as is remarkably proved by many of them supposing that Jesus Christ was Elias. Aher
the time of Christ it was believed by some of the early fathers and by several large sects.
Persons who have taken a
fancy to exalt the Druids to the perfection of human nature
have denied that it was held by them; but in doing this, they have shut their eyes to
the clmrest evidence. Casar§ says,
"
In primis hoc volunt persuadere non interire
animas, sed ab aliis post mortem transire ad alios pumnt."-They do not think that after

death souls cease to exist, but that they pass into other bodies. Nothing can be clearer
than this evidence. It is a fact which must have been well known, and of such a nature,
that he could not well be mistaken. There are no grounds whatever for disputing his
statement. This doctrine was held by the Chaldeans; and it has been observed by an
ingenious writer, that in the colleges of these persons much useful learning must have
been taught or Daniel would not have consented to preside over them.
As much as this doctrine is now scouted, it was held not only by almost all the great
men of antiquity, but a late very ingenious writer, philosopher, and Christian apologist,
avowed his belief in it and published a defence of it, namely, the late Soame Jenyns.'°
On the subject of the metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, the Bishop of Dro-
more very truly observes, that "
the Druids taught and the Celtic nation believed the
metempsychosis, or a transmigration of the soul out of one body into another; this is
so positively asserted of them by Caesar, who had been long conversant among them
and knew them well, that it is not in the power of any of the modern system-makers to
argue and explain his words away, as they have attempted to do in every other point re-
lating to the Celtic antiquities ;" however, they endeavour to quality it by asserting, that
the Celtic nations believed only that the soul passed out of one human body into another,
and never into that of brutes.1'
DRUIDS HAD AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM OF M0BA.LS.1CHAP. VII. SECT. VIII.
According to Valerius Maximus; it was no unusual thing for the Gauls to lend
money to be repaid again in some kind of way in another life. Our priests are firm
believers in the doctrine of a fixture state, but I should be sorry to put their faith to this
kind of test; I suspect they would rather have their money in the three-per cent consols.
The account given by Ammianus Marcellinus of the Druidical doctrines is extremely
flattering to them, and I can see no reason to dispute his authority; he comes strongly
in confirmation of what we know from Origen that Celsus had been saying of them. He
says, that the Druids were men of exalted genius, ranged in regular societies, who, by
the advice of Phythagoras, raised their minds to the most
sublime inquiries, and despis-
ing human and worldly affairs, strongly pressed upon their disciples the immortality of
the soul. Lucan says, that, according to the Druid opinion, the ghosts of the dead de-
scended not to Erebus, or the empire of Pluto, (there to remain in a state of separation
from all body, as the Greeks and Romans thought,) but that the same soul actuated an-

other body in another world.* Pomp. Melaf declares, that the Druids maintained that
the souls were immortal, and that there was another life after this, wherein they existed
among other departed ghosts; and that they did, for this reason, burn and inter with the
dead what suited their rank and inclinations when they were alive. The authors lately
alluded to, who wish to make the Druids all perfection, have endeavoured to overturn the
evidence of Caesar; but Dr. Borlase has shewn,1 that the attempt is without any success.
For my own
part, I am of opinion, that the burying along with the body, trinkets or other
property, was done for the same reason that the bodies in Siberia are found covered with
plates of gold, and rich persons in England are buried in expensive shrouds, namely, to
do them honour-to shew them respect. In general, I think, it may be admitted, that in
the time of Casar they held the doctrines of Pythagoras; but, probably, from the length
of time which had passed since that philosopher had lived, some, at least, trifling devia-
tions had taken place; and, perhaps, some difference of opinion might exist amongst
them upon speculative and philosophical points. Their moral doctrines seem to have
been short and simple-to wars/:Qu the gods, to do no evil, and to be valiant in battle.
This code of moral law is very short, but it is very comprehensive; and it may be a
question whether, if every individual in a
society acted up to these precepts, the society
would not be the happiest of any that ever existed. In these three pithy sentences are
included our whole duty to God, our whole duty to man, and our whole duty to our
country. Without any very violent extension every thing necessary seems to be
included.
The Druids are said to have set aside one
day in seven for the purpose of religion: the
sunday, or
day ofthe sun, has been supposed to be the day; and 'Clemens Alexandrinus
has been quoted in support of this opinion. I think, from their veneration for the sun,
and from their known custom of naming the days of the week after the planets, it is very
likely that this might be the case. But the Rev. Mr. Hughs, in his liberal and gentle-
manly reply to my book, entitled, Hora Sabbaticae, has shewn, that all the quotations of
Clemens, from Homer and Hesiod, are
false-nothing but pious fraud.§
JUDGES AND ADMINISTRATORS OF THE LAW._Cl-IAP. VII. SECT. IX.
As the Druids were the sole depositaries of the laws of their country, which, being un-
written like our common law, were retained in memory, they were obliged to be very well
skilled in every thing relating to them. I have little doubt that an unwritten law has con-
'
Mala, the geograpber, says, the Thracians held one ofthe doctrines of the Druids as a common, national persua-
sion, and it is not improbable that they may have learnt it from them; that souls, alter being purified by their Inns-
migration, attained a condition of endlw Felicity.

286 MISLETOE AND OTHER SACRED PLANTS.-CHAP. VII. SECT. X.
. Thev had a curious mode of trial by the oaths
tinued in Britain from their day to ours U
of a certain number of men, who were brought together to swear that they believed the
man
charged with an offence to be innocent. But it appears that, before they took their
oaths all the witnesses whom the prisoner could bring were examined by him, and the
judge was bound by their decision. I call this trial, not by adjuration, as it has been in-
advertently called, but trial by Jiffy; and good trial too. Thus we may trace to them
both the practice of trial by jury and an unwritten law.
The law was called Tana in Ireland, and was the Tons. of the Hebrews. Dr.
O'Brien translates the word Coisde, a
jury of twelve men to try, according to English
law.-" It will appear, by the following laws, that in cases of disputed property, the
ancient Irish did also try by twelve men, whose sentence must be unanimous. Coisde
is an
original word implying a trial by law; in many parts of Ireland it is still used in
that sense, as Cuigfdlz me tim ar coisde, I will bring you to trial; Sclavonice Kuchjh,
the hall of justice; Persicé Cuc/zeri, a code of laws." *
The Mancksmen ascribe their code of laws, which is allowed to be very good, to the
Druids.'|' It was their practice, though not actual combatants, to accompany their
countrymen to battle, and to animate and encourage them with the expectation of
future happiness, if they fell in the contest. An account is given by Tacitus of the
advance of the Romans to storm the last strong hold of the Druids, whom they had
proscribed, in the Isle of Anglesey. The Druidesses are represented to have acted like
furies, running about amongst the soldiers in black garments with dxshevelled hair, and
even sword in hand, forcing them, when retreating, back to the fight. They are thus
looked upon with detestation by those who, at Eton or Westminster, imbibe the notion,
that every thing is good which a Greek or Roman could do, who triumph with !Eneas
over the unfortunate Turnus, or glory with the Romans over the fall of Carthage. But
if these women had been Roman matrons defending the capitol, we should never have
heard the last of their gallantry and patriotism.
MISLETOE AND OTHER SACRED PLANTS.-'CHAP.VII. SECT. X.
The Druids are said to have been much addicted to the study of the qualities of veg1e~
tables, plants, and herbs. Vervain was
amongst their greatest favourites; they used it
in casting lots and foretelling fixture events; they used it to anoint persons to prevent
fevers, Src.; but it was to be gathered with certain ceremonies and at certain seasons of
the year.
"
They deified the misletoe, and were not to approach either that or the selago,
or the samolus, but in the most devout and reverential manner. When the end of the
year approached, they marched with great solemnity to gather the misletoe of the oak, in

order to present it to Jupiter, inviting all the world to assist at this ceremony, with these
words: The new year is at hand, gather the misletoe."*
Pliny says,
"
The Druids (as the Gauls call their magicians or wise men) held nothing
so sacred as the misletoe, and the tree on which it grows, provided it be an oak. They
make choice of oak groves in preference to all others, and perform no rites without oak
leaves; so that they seem to have the name of Druids from them, if we derive their name
from the Greek. They think whatever grows on these trees is sent from heaven, and is
a sign that the Deity has made choice of that tree. But as the misletoe is seldom to be
met with, when found, it is fetched with great ceremony, and by all means on the sixth
day of the moon, which with them begins the months and years, and the period of thirty
years, which they term an age; for at that season the moon has sulhcient influence, and
is above half full. They call this plant in their own
language all heal, and after preparing
for the sacrifice and feast under the tree, they bring up two white bulls, whose horns
have been then bound for the first time. The priest, habited in white, mounts the tree,
and with a
golden hook cuts the misletoe, which is received in a white cloth. They then
sacrifice the victims, praying the Deity to render this his gift favourable to those to
whom they distribute it. They suppose it renders every animal fruitful which drinks a
decoction of it, and that it is a
remedy against all sorts of poisons. So much does the
greatest part of national religion consist of tritles."'|'
The selago, a kind of hedge hyssop, resembling the savine, and the samolus, or marsh-
wort, or the round-leaved water pimpernel, were also supposed to have supernatural
powers, to prevent evils and cure diseases, and were
gathered at particular times with
great ceremonies. They were great anatomists, and are said to have given lectures on
the bodies of living men, to an extent that is quite incredible.;
We have the authority of very respectable writers of the Romans to the physical
knowledge of the Druids; Caesar and Mela say, that they reason much, and instruct
.their youth in many things relating to the planets and their motions. Caius Sulpicius,
tribune of the soldiers in the Macedonian war, a Gaul by nation, foretold an
eclipse of
the moon to the Roman army, upon which Livy adds, that thenceforth Gallos Romanis
militibus sapientia prope divina visos.§ Astronomy and geography seem to have been
the particular department of the Eubages or Vates, that is, they were astrologers and
magicians. It was their business, no doubt, to watch the wandering stars, tlze disposers

in astrological aifairs; they might be prophets, like the companies of them of whom we
read in the Old Testament, but the chief Druid, with his rod, was the great prophesier
and performer of miracles.
WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT AND THE ANGUINUM.*CHAP. VII. SECT. XI.
An infinity of learning has been displayed by Dr. Stukeley, to prove, that the Druids
worshiped serpents. And I should suppose, that every thing which any one of the
ancients has ever said upon the subject of serpent worship, may be found in his book
upon Abury. I think the shape of that temple must satisfy any one, that they did pay
it some kind of adoration. The brazen serpent set up by Moses in the wilderness, to
which the Jews oifered incense all the days of Samuel, David, and Solomon, seems to
shew, that the Israelites paid a certain kind of adoration or
worship to the serpent, and
that without any offence to God. From this serpent it is supposed, that a sect of early
Christians called Ophites took their origin. They called themselves Christians, but they
must have been of an odd kind. They venerated the serpent of Genesis, by whom they
denied that sin was
brought into the world; maintaining, that it was a
personification of
the good principle, who instructed Eve in all the learning of the world which has
descended to us. Most of the ancient idolaters had a
great veneration for this creature.
Dr. Borlase allows, that if the Druids had groves consecrated to Mithras, a God whose
common symbol was a
serpent, and temples in a
serpentine form, they must have been
worshipers of serpents. Now since Dr. Borlase's time, many remains of temples of
Mithra have been found in Britain, but whether they were Roman or British it may be
diliicult to determine so
satisfactorilyas that there shall not remain some doubt. The ser-
pentine form of the temple at Abury, has been so
fully conirmed by the examination and
measurements of the celebrated antiquarian, Sir R. C. Hoare, Bart., that I should think
there could remain no doubt on the subject. And Dr. Borlase considerably strengthens
Stukeley's doctrine by the fact which he points out, that a mound on the Karnbré hill is
thrown up in a
serpentine form. In addition to all which we must not forget the famous
Anguinum, of which Dr. Borlase* has given a
particular description in the following
words:
"
Besides the secret virtues attributed by the Druids to their Misletoe, Selago, and
Samolus, which were looked upon, when ritually gathered and preserved, as so
many
powerliil charms to keep oil' sickness and misfortunes; their opinion concerning the
Anguinum was
altogether extravagant. The Anguinum or
serpent's egg, was a
congeries
of small snakes rolled together, and incrusted with a shell, formed by the saliva and vis-
cous gum, froth, or sweat, of the mother serpent. The Druids say, that this egg is tossed
*
Page 141.
wonsnrr or rue snnrerzr AND THE ANGUINUM._CHAP. vrr. sxactr. xr. 289
in the air by the hissings of its dam, and that before its Fall again to the earth it should be
received in the Sagus, lest it be defiled. '
The person who was to
carry off the egg must
make the best of his way on horseback, for the serpent pursues this ravisher of its young
ones, even to the brink of the next river; they also pretend, that this egg is to he taken oi?
from its dam only at one
particular time of the moon. The trial whether this egg was
good
in its kind, and of sumcient efficacy, was made by seeing whether it would swim against
the stream, even though it were set in gold." Such absurdities did they propagate, in
order to set a
price and value upon trifles, and no doubt to make the credulgus mu||;i¢ude
purchase them from their own order only, as
by them only regularly and ritually procured,
and of full virtue at no other time, or from the hands of any other person than those of a
Druid. '
I have seen, says Pliny,~]' that egg; it is about the bigness ofa moderate apple,
its shell a
cartilaginous incrustation, full of little cavities, such as are on the legs of the
polypus; it is the Insigne or badge of distinction, which all the Druids wear. For
getting the better of their adversaries in any kind of dispute, and introducing them to the
friendship of great men, they think nothing equal to the Anguinum; and of my own
knowledge, I can say, that Claudius Caesar ordered a Roman knight, of the Vecontian
family, to be put to death, for no other reason, but that, when he had a trial at law before
a
judge, he brought into court, in his bosom, the Anguinum.' This Anguinum is, in
British, called Glain-neidr, that is, the serpent of glass; and some remains of that super.
stitious reverence, formerly paid it by the Britons, is still to he discovered in Comwa1I_
Mr. Edward Lhwydi says, that he '
had no
opportunity of observing any remains of
Druidism among the Armorican Britons; but the Cornish retain a
variety of charms, and

the snake to make it, when they have found one asleep and stuck a hazel wand in the
centre of her spira.'
"In most parts of Wales, and throughout all Scotland, and in Cornwall, we find it a com-
mon opinion of the vulgar, that about Midsummer Eve, (although in the time they do not
all agree,) it is usual for snakes to meet in companies; and that, by joining heads together,
a kind of bubble is formed, which the rest, by continually hissing, blow on till it
passes
quite through the body, and then it immediately hardens, and resembles a
glass ring; which
whoever finds (as some old women and children are persuaded) shall prosper in all his
undertakings. The rings thus generated, are called Gleineu Nadroeth ; English, Snake
Stones.§ They are small glass amulets, commonly about half as wide as our finger rings,

but much thicker, of a
green colour usually, though sometimes blue, and waved with
red and white."
The opinion of the Cornish is somewhat differently given us
by Mr. Carew: "
The
country people (in Cornwall) have a
persuasion, that the snakes here breathing upon a
hazel wand, produce a stone ring of blue colour, in which there appears the yellow figure
ol' a snake, and that beasts bit and envenomed, being given some Water to drink, wherein
this stone has been infused, will perfectly recover of the poison." 1'
The Druids were also wont to consecrate some particular rocks and stones, and then
persuade their devotees, that great virtues were to be attributed to them. Of this kind
was the jiztal stone, called so as supposed to contain the fate of the Irish royal family.
On this the supreme kings of Ireland used to be inaugurated on the hill of Tarah; and
the ancient Irish had a persuasion, that in what country soever this stone remained, there
one of their blood was to reign.;
The rocking-stones, called in Cornwall, Iogan stones, are also thought by some§ to be
engines of the same fraud, and the Druids might probably have recourse to them and
pretend, that nothing but the holy hands ofa Druid could move them, when they wanted
to confirm their authority and judicial decisions, by any such specious miracle.
From these fooleries of different kinds, practised upon the credulous and ignorant
populace, there can be no doubt that the serpent came in for a share of the common
adoration, most likely as an emblem of some kind of mysterious doctrine.
It has been said, that they were not idolaters; this certainly cannot be supported.
The evidence of Caesar is clear upon that point; but yet I think it may be inferred, that
the worship of idols was
only beginning to prevail in Gaul, and was not in universal
practice. There are no
signs of it in England.
WORSHIP OF THE SUN IN '1'AU1`lUS.-CHAP. VII. SECT. XII.
Of all the Gods of antiquity, perhaps no one was more generally worshiped than the
sun, under the emblem of the Bull of the Zodiac ;-a worship which must have had its
origin more than 6000 years ago.
I have hitherto used the calculation of the Rev. Mr. Maurice, as the reader has seen,

This stone was sent into Scotland, where it continued as the coronation seat ot' the Scottish kings, till, in the
year 1300, Edward I. of England brought it from Scone, placing it under the coronation chair at Westminster. The

which he vil1 now
perceive is in every case much within the mark, though quite enough
tor my argument.
Sir William Drummond says,
"
The sun at the vernal equinox, reckoning by the real
zodiac, rctrograded into the constellation of Aries, about 4-320 years before the present
time, supposing the sun to be now
just entering the 30th degree of Aquarius at the
vernal equinox."* Now add to the 4-320 the sum of 2160, making 64-80, and we shall
have the real time when the sun entered Taurus.
After all that the reader has seen, he will not have been surprised to find the Bull
amongst the gods of the Druids. By a bull, made of brass, the Cimbri, Teutones, and
Ambroncs, swore to observe the capitulation made with the Romans on the Adige.
After their deleat, Catnlus took this bull and kept it in his house, as a
trophy of his
victory. The circumstance of this bull puts the Tauric worship of the East and the
actual idolatry out of all doubt.1' In my researches I have often been surprised that I
inet with few or no
signs of the ancient Tauric worship, except the festival of the May-
pole. This may be accounted for by the enmity which the old Druids in Britain had to
images or
eliigies of any kind. However, the bull of the Cimbri and Ambrones shews
that it not only made a
part of the Celtic worship, but from the manner in which it was
used, it is evident that it was considered as the most sacred of their objects of worship
by which they could swear, and from their violation of the oath it seems
they were
become almost as
corrupt as the Romans.:
HUM.-LN SACRIFICES.1CHAP. VII. SECT. XIII.
Dr. Smith thinks the Druids never offered any human or even animal sacrifices. It
would be a great gratification if I could be persuaded that this was true; but the asser-
tion of Caesar is clear and unequivocal. Dr. Smith says, that in the Gaelic language,
customs, or traditions, there is not a hint allusive to the sacrifice of any living being.
He observes, "
This silence with regard to these is the more remarkable, as not only the
distant allusions, but even the practice of some of their other sacrifices, have still some
existence in several parts of North Britain. These consist of a libation of flour, milk,
eggs, and some few herbs and simples.§ He subjoins, that the Gaelic name for sacri-

dough, and t/wirt, to olfer, the tb quiescent; that when they did offer a living sacrifice,
if ever
they did, it consisted of some noxious animal, as the wild boar!
Mr. King has pointed out an instance of a human sacrifice by Einar, Thane of Caith-
ness, of Haldanus, Prince of Norway, so late as the tenth century.1' I am
strongly in-
clined to flatter myself that it was
only upon the most extraordinary occasions that these
horrible rites were resorted to. This was the case with the Israelites, and with the
Tyrians, and indeed I think with all nations. No doubt these examples of the craft
and wickedness of priests are horrible; but unfortunately the priests of every nation
ot' antiquity have had recourse to them. They prevailed occasionally in every nation
upon earth, until the arrival of the Priest of the religion and order of Melchizedek; and
alas, the religious wars of the middle ages, and of the Reformation, although in a dilferent
tbrm, prove that fanaticism and bigotry were still accompanied with the thirst for blood.
If it be thought right to retain a
priesthood in a
government like ours, where the good
ot' the governed is the lirst object, it can never be kept within its just bounds with too
much severity, nor its petty but unceasing exertions to aggrandise the order be too
rigorously repressed. For my own part, I am inclined to the opinion of the society
of Friends, that orders of priesthood have been more prejudicial than usetixl to the
religion of Jesus; which is of the most simple character-the religion of the heart-
so
plain, that every man may unrlerstanrl it-img' ainx-qu, the poor man's religion. It
requires neither liturgies, altars, nor sacrifices-neither bishops, cardinals, nor popes:
and if there be any point in which it is pre-eminently excellent above all others, it is
in its utter repugnancy to that in which it so much abounds-pomps, ceremonia,
and priestcraft.
Priests of the Jews and of the Christians have been equally desirous of disguising to
themselves and their followers the Israelitish custom of human sacrifices. From all
profane as well as sacred historians we know that it was a custom of the natives of the
countries in the neighbourhood of Judea-the Sidonians, Tyrians, Ammonites, &c.;
and from the laws of Moses also it seems
pretty clear, that if it were not a sort of ac-
knowledged duty to offer up the first-born, at least it was considered a
very meritorious
act of selfldenial. This I think may be inferred from the laws which he made to prevent
it; as, in the place ofolfering up the object devoted, a redemption-price was substituted.;
Exod. xxii. 29 :
"
Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy
liquors: 'ran rxasr Bonn or 'ray sons shalt thou give unto me." These could not
be meant for the service ofthe temple, because every required service was otherwise pro-

vided for. Every thing which is said in sacred writ to be devoted to the Lord, by the
original meaning of the word devoted, (though the word became in time changed,)*' was
meant to be sacrificed. This appears to have been the custom of the country, though
not
generally practised by Abraham's tribe. From the way in which Abraham received
and obeyed the command to offer up Isaac without any remonstrance, as was
practised by
him on other occasions, it does not appear to have been any thing strange to him,
Against the destruction of Sodom he said much; against the sacrifice of Isaac he said
nothing. Except this projected sacrifice of Isaac, we read of no persons devoted to the
Lord, or human sacrifices, till after the return from Egypt. Then we find the Canaan-
ites devoted; and we know the laws of Moses for the redemption of certain devoted
objects.
Various reasons
may be assigned for these facts. Charity, as well as
religion, require
that we should adopt the most favourable: thatl conceive to be, that Moses fbreseeing
or
tearing that his people would fall into the practices of the country, in part adopted
the principle, in order that, by the contrivance of the price of redemption, he might
eH`ectually prevent the practice. And in this he appears tohave succeeded; for there
do not appear ,to have been any human sacrifices (according to the common
meaning
of the word sacrifice) but in two cases, and they are both very extraordinary. The first
is that of Jephtha. Here his daughter, from an
uzgfbreseen casualty, came to be the devoted
object, and was sacrificed accordingly; Moses not having foreseen such a
casualty, and
oi' course not having provided against it. Iam not ignorant what has been written by
Jews and Christians to disguise the fact, which is as clear as the sun at noon.1'
Judges xi. 80. "
And Jephtha vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt
without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
31.
"
Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of' the doors of my house to
meet me, when I retum in peace from the children of' Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's,
and I will oH`er it up for a BURN! orrEn1No."
39.
"
And it came to pass, at the end of' two months, that she returned unto her
father, who did with her according to /lis can which he had vowed."
How any thing can be clearer than this language, I do not know. It was considered
amongst the daughters of Israel to be the most disgracefiil of all misfortunes not to
become mothers. And it was under the pretence of bewailing this misfortune, that the
daughter of Jephtha pleaded for and obtained from her father a respite of two months.
The sophistry about her being sent to a
nunnery, is too trifling to deserve notice. Jeph-
'
This arose from a wish of the priest to appropriate the devoted article lo hisown use instead ofburning it. Thus
at last lands, 8tc., mme to be devoted.
-f' The original principle was this, that nothing could be too valuable to be offered to God. The principle vms
surely good, but when carried to axe , bad. Moses admitted the principle, but repressed the sxcsss.
294- HUMAN SACRIFICES.--CHAP. VII. SECT. XIII.
tha sacrificed his daughter, in this extraordinary and unforseen case, because there was
no
redemption-price ordained by law.
The other human sacrifice to which I alluded is described in I Kings xvi. 84-, in these
words: "In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof
in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segnb, accord-
ing to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun."
The meaning of this verse does not clearly appear, except that there really was a sacri-
fice. The rebuilding of Jericho was
directly against the command of Joshua, who said,
"Cursed be the man before the Lord that raiseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he
shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up
the gates ofit."*
This sacrifice appears to have been made to propitiate the anger of God; and Hiel,
however mistaken he might be, appears to have acted from sincere devotion. As the city
was rebuilt and continued to flourish for many generations, had we a Druid here to plead
his own cause, he would say, that it was evident that the anger of God was
assuaged and
his offended justice satisfied.
It is related by Mr. Ledwich,1' and repeated by Mr. Fosbrook; that under each of the
stones of one of the Druid circles the remains of a human body were found. From this
the former inters, that it was a
sepulchxal monument; but this seems a
hasty conclusion.
If it had been only one stone, or if it had been under several stones placed without any
regular order, that the body or bodies had been found, I might have agreed with them,
and have supposed that it had been a
cemetery; but the situation of the bodies under the
walls of a
temple makes me
greatly to fear that here the example of Hiel, or the same
species of superstition, was followed. (This was noticed before, Chap. V. Sect. xl.) This
suspicion receives confirmation from a
story related of St. Patrick, that when he first came
to Ireland and wished to build a church, the walls of it were thrown down by demons,
as fast as he built them, until he sacrificed a man, and placed him under the foundation,
when it stood firm. Whether Patrick ever came to Ireland or not, this tradition seems
to prove that such a
practice occasionally prevailed. The same
story is told ofSt. Columba,
when he founded a church at Iona. All these traditions tend to confirm the fact.
Indeed, I much fear, that it is impossible to acquit these ancient Pythagoreans of
having fallen into this horrible custom. The evidence of Caesar and the Romans cannot
be explained away; nor is there any thing to throw a doubt upon it except the plea that
they were
likely to fabricate such a
charge to excuse their own
cruelty to them; or if
they only sacrificed, as it has been alleged, great criminals as executors of the laws, and
for the purpose of deterring others from the commission of crimes, Caesar may have seized
this and misrepresented it to serve his purpose. It is not right to
justify the crim of

HUMAN SACRIFXCES.=CHAP. vrr. sscr. XIII. 295
one set of' people by the crimes of another; but yet it would be hardly fair, upon this
occasion, either to them or the Jews, not to observe, that the practice of' offering human
victims was common at one time or other to almost all the most polished nations of anti-
quity. It may be found amongst the Egyptians and Phoenicians, the Scythotauri, the
Laodiceans, the Lacedemonians, the Arcadians, and the Cretans; in Chios, Salamis, and
Sicily. The Romans offered human victims after the battle ol' Caunae, and it appears,
from Dyonysius Halicarnassusf that they did not abandon this horrible custom till
about 100 years before Christ.
It was an article of' the Druidical creed that nothing but the life qfman could atonejbr
the /W of mau.1' This doctrine has been, as usual, found where almost all the very re-
condite doctrines of these people are to be found--in the hooks of the Jews. As Moses
contrived to abolish human sacrifices by the practice oi' redemption for a price, he, in
like manner, contrived to destroy the evil effects of the principle of the atonement, by
appointing cities of refuge for the man-slayer to flee to. On this subject Caesar says,
"
And for that cause such as are grievously diseased, or conversant continually in the
danger of war, do either sacrifice men for an oblation or vow the oblation of themselves,
using in such sacrifice the ministry of the Druids; forusmuch as
they are
persuaded that
the immortal Deity cannot be pleased but by giving the life of' one man for the life ofan-
other, and to that purpose they have public sacrifices appointed."j'_
The following is the account given by Dr. Borlase ot` these horrid rites of the Druids:
"
Their victims were of' several kinds. Sometimes beasts ; as at the gathering of the
misletoe, two white bulls;§ but especially beasts taken from their enemies in war;
however, their more solemn sacrifices consisted of human victims, and it cannot be dis-
sembled, that the Druids were extremely lavish of human blood. Not only criminals,
captives, and strangers, were slain at their sacrifices, but their very disciples were put to
death without mercy, if they were
wilfully tardy in coming to their assemblies. No
people, however, could, I think, have wrought themselves up to such a total contempt
of' human life and the body of man, who had not, at the same time, the most elevated
notions of' the soul, and the most certain persuasion of' iuturity; but this, instead of
being their excuse, will only shew us how the greatest truths may be made the occasion
of the most horrid sins, where proper notions of' the Deity do not obtain, and where
truth, and reason, and philosophy, are
permitted to he built upon by the father of' error.
The Druids held several opinions which contributed to confirm them in this dreadful
custom. For the redemption of the life of man, they held, that nothing but the life of
man could be accepted by the Gods;|[ and the consequence of' this was, that those
who implored safety from the dangers of war, or the most desperate distempers, either

immediately sacrificed some human creature, or made a vow to do so soon after. Their
human sacrifices generally consisted ot' such criminals as were convicted of theft, or
any
capital crime; and some of these have been sacrificed after an
imprisonment of five
years ;* but when such malefactors were not at hand, the innocent supplied their place.
They held, that man was the most precious, and therefore the most grateful victim which
they could oH`er to their Gods ; and the more dear and beloved was the person, the more
acceptable they thought the offering of him would be accounted. Hence, not only
beautiful captives and strangers ;'|' but princes, and the first-born of their own children,
were, upon great and interesting occasions, offered upon their altars. Nature it seems
was silent, and did not say, with the prophet Micah;
'
Shall I give my first-born for
my transgression, the fruit of' my body for the sin of my soul P' In order to satisfy the
scrupulous of the innocence of such barbarous sacrifices, and to reconcile the devoted
victim to his fate, the Druids held, that the souls of those who served as victims to their
Gods in this life, were deified, or at least translated into heaven to be happy there; and
the remains of those who died in sacrifice, were accounted most holy, and honoured
before any other dead bodies.§ Variety of deaths they had for those miserable victims,
as if they had been afraid that they should fall into a
loathing and dislike of such sacri-
fices, if they confined themselves to one particular manner of despatching them. Some
they shot to death with arrows ; others they crucified in their temples; some were
impaled in honour to their Gods, and then, with many others who had suffered in a
diH`erent manner, were offered up as a burnt-sacrihce. Others were bled to death, and
their blood being received in basins served to sprinkle their altars.|| Some were stabbed
to the heart, that by the direction in which (after the fatal stroke) the body fell, either to
the right or left, forward or backward, by the convulsion of the limbs, and by the flow
of blood, the Druids (such erudition there is in butchery !) might foretell what was to
come.1[
"
One Druid sacrifice was still more monstrous. They made a
huge image of straw;
the limbs of it were joined together, and shaped by wicker-work: this sheath, or case,
they filled with human victims; and Strabo adds, '
with wood for fuel and several kinds
of wild beasts,' imagining perhaps, that by avariety of expiring groans and howlings
they might terrify their Gods into a
compliance with their solicitations ; to this image
they set fire, consuming that, and the inclosed, at one holocaust. In what shape this
image of straw was made, Caesar does not say, but probably it was in that ofa bull; for
they used to sacrifice bulls," and carried to war with them the image of' a bull; and the
bull is one of the largest and most capacious of the brute kind, and therefore the fittest

ibr such a dreadful oliice. Whilst they were
performing these horrid rites, the drums
and trumpets sounded without intermission, that the cries of the miserable victims might
not be heard or distinguished by their friends, it being accounted very ominous, if the
Iamentations of either children or parents were
distinctly to be heard whilst the victim
was
burning! The victim being offered, they prayed most solemnly to the Gods with
uplifted hands and great zeal; and when the entrails had been properly examined by the
Diviners, Pliny1° thinks that the Druids ate part of the human victim ; what remained
was consumed by the last fire upon the altar; intemperance in drinking generally closed
the sacrificing ; and the altar was always consecrated afresh, by strewing oak-leaves on
it, before any sacrifice could be offered upon it again."1
This account of Dr. Borlase's, I fear, is too true, but yetl would fain flatter myselt
that some allowance ought to be made for exaggeration, arising from a wish in the Ro-
mans to justify or excuse their own cruelty to the enemies whom they could not subdue.
And I think, on a consideration of all the other circumstances, that these horrid rites
were only had recourse to on very great and extraordinary cases of public and national
distress-like that of the conquest of Britain by their enemies at that time; and such
as that which prompted the Romans to the same acts after the battle of Cannae: and in
this opinion I am distinctly supported by a most respectable historian, Diodorus
Siculus, who aiiirms, that these sacrifices were
only resorted to on
very extraordinary
occasions. All their other rites, ceremonies, morality, &c., seem so
contrary to such
practices, that I cannot believe them common, and I think there is ground to comfort
myself with the belief] that their general sacrgfce was the inolfensive Persian and Mel-
chizedekean offering of bread and wine§ still continued, though corrupted, by the
Romish Church.||

THE INSTITUTION OF PRIEST]-IOODS AN EVl'L.--CHAP. VII. SECT. XIV.
Man, in all ages, has had a natural propensity to multiply religious rites and ceremo-
nies. This arises from fear-from a dread of that futurity which he can never fathom.
In this priests find their account, therefore they encourage it. To aid the priest in taking
advantage of this weakness the female, by nature timid, lends her assistance: united,
they are always irresistible. From this source was derived the absurd and complicated

machinery of all the religions of the ancients, and of most of those of the modems.
Man cunningly whispers to himself that he had better believe too much than too little.
If he believe all, he not only cannot err by unbelief, but he arrives at the very perfection
ot' virtue, according to the priests, lively faith ;* while if he take only a
part he may
incur the guilt of incredulity-the greatest of crimes, according to the doctrine of the
priests of all religions. Hence religions naturally tend to increase in complication, in
gloom, and in misery, as the history of them all proves. From this cause, steadily acting,
arose the multitude of the Heathen Gods, the horrid rites of Moloch, of Tyre, and of the
Druids-the thousand Gods of the Hindoos, and the thousand Saints of the Romish
Church. The same cause is never dormant. It may be traced in the acts of the Mis-
sionaries in France at the present moment, and in Britain in the conversion of our
Sundays, our
fifty-two festivals, from days of joy to days of sadness and humiliation.
After a time it generally becomes so bad that it is no longer endurable. A new fanati-
cism arises. A war ensues, and fanaticism I/ze second beats fanaticism t/zeyfrst. Thus
it was with our Reformation. The fanatics of the Long Parliament beat the fanatics of
the Pope, and if a concurrence
ofvery extraordinary circumstances had not come together,
fanaticism the second would have been worse than fanaticism t/zeytrst. By a
piece of
unexpected good fortune, it became, the interest of the priests to take a middle course
hetwixt the two follies, and a
system arose which, in practical utility, was the best that
ever existed. But it is daily giving way to the universal law of change. It is the first
law of nature, that nothing should stand still-should be permanent. That which was
good two hundred years ago, does not suit the present improved state of the human
mind.
At the time of our Reformation the concurrence of e.ztraor¢I¢'nmy circumstances to
which I have just alluded, produced an
exfraordinary event-one solitary event,
unexampled in the history of the world-an order of priesthood lriendly to liberty, and
therefore not the curse of its country. Nothing of this kind ever
happened betbre. l
except not even the priesthood of the Jews. According to their histories, all the miseries
of their state arose from the corruption of their religion by the priests, who seduced the
people into idolatry. It began in the manufacture of a
golden calf by Aaron, and ended
in the performance of that act, by the Pnrrasr Caiaphas, of which the more virtuous
HEATHEN Pilate, washed his hands.1-

Faith! proved by Mr. Locke to be a matter of neoesity, not of choice. A man cannot choose to believe or not to
believe. Thus unbelief may be a misfortune, but can never be a crime. Of all the discoveries by Mr. Locke this was
the most important, though now studiously kept out ofsight; for if it were attended to, there would be at once an end
oi' religiouswar or persecution. The doctrine ofthe Roman Church, upon this point, is as excellent as the pmclice nl'
its priests is detestable.

THE INSTITUTION or Pnisruoons AN EVIL.-CHAP. vu. SECT. xrv. 299
Of all the evils which escaped from Pandora's box, the institution of priesthoods was
the worst. Priests have been the curse of the world. And if we admit the merits of
many of those of our own time to be as
pre-eminent above those of all others, as the
esprit du corps of the most self-contented individual of the order may incite him to
consider them, great as I am
willing to allow the merits of many individuals to be, I
will not allow that they form exceptions strong enough to
destroy the general nature of
the rule. Look at China, the festival of Juggernaut, the Crusades, the massacres of St.
Bartholomew, of the Mexicans, and of the Peruvians, the fires of the Inquisition, ofMary,
Cranmer, Calvin, and of the Druids; look at Ireland, look at Spain; in short, look
every where and you will see the priests reeking with gore. They have converted, and
are converting, populous and happy nations into deserts, and have made our beautiful
world, into a
slaughter-house drenched with blood and tears!

Ar-'rsa I had made considerable progress in my researches relating to the Druids, I applied to
the British Museum for Col. Vallencey's Collectanea de Rebus Hibemicis, and four volumes were
brought to mc. It never occurred to me that there might be other volumes not in that Library,
and I never made any inquiry. But after a very considerable part of this work was
printed, I
discovered that there were two more at the London Institution.
In them I found that, in several instances, the same observations had occurred to Col. Vallencey
as those which had occurred to me ; particularly relating to my hypothesis ofthe original inven-
tion of figures and letters. I found that if I made use of them, some of them ought to have
come in the earlier part of the book. I did not choose to pass them unnoticed for several reasons.
I did not choose to appear as a servile copyist or a plagiarist, without
acknowledgment, from the
Colonel. Besides, if I had made no observation respecting them, I should have thrown away a
very strong circumstance in support of the truth of my system. First, in having the learned
Colonel of my opinion; and, secondly, in the fact of our
having, though travelling by diderent
routes, totally unconnected, arrived at the same conclusion. And this surely is very much in its
favour. For these reasons I determined to add an
Appendix, in which I have been tempted tn
insert a
variety of passages from other authors in support of my opinion, which I did not discover
till it was too lute to insert them in the body of the work.
Col. Vallencey supposes that all learning came from a race of people called Scythians, originally
living to the North-East of the Black Sea, the seat of the ancient Colchis. These are
really nothing
more than the people, or the descendants of the people, whom I have proved, in my second chapter,
to have been called by ancient authors Gomerians, Cimmerii, or Celtee ; and I believe we mean
the ame people. I suspect he has been, like Sir W. Jones, Mr. Richardson, and others, fettered
by the mistaken passage of Genesis. However that be, I cannot see in the whole of his essays a
single argument or fact which may not be explained with the greatest ease to support my hypo-
thesis iu the foregoing work, except in such cases as
they do not apply to it at all. There is much
in his last two volumes, which I could have used if I had seen them in time, but the want of this I
do not regret, because it is amply compensated by the circumstance of a diferent chain of argu-
ment having brought each of us to the same conclusion. I confess I was not sorry to see the well-
merited chastisement which he has given to his opponents, who have attacked him, as if in his
attempts to rescue the Irish histories from oblivion, (whether wisely or
unwisely, successfully or
unsuccessfully, does not
signify,) he had been guilty of a crime. Their illiheral invectives, and
the misrepresentations ou which they have founded their coarse and vulgar satire, he has well
exposed. Perhaps envy and vexation, that a swordsman, and not a
gownsman, should have been
the author of his works may have been the cause of the opposition with which they were met.

and 318, where references are given to a German work, by John Picardt, in which it is described at
large. It is also noticed in Schaltens's History of Westphalia, Vol. VII. p. 487.
Chap. I. Sect. xxi.-Since the observation respecting the Muin was written, I have been in-
formed that in the Sunscrit language the M forms the emphatic article. Then M-uin will be

Chap. II. Sect. iii.-The opinion which I have expressed respecting the situation of the tower of
Babel was held by some of the early fathers. Cyril observes, that C/zalane, where the tower
was built by the _first men, is situated in the remotest pm-ts, as it were, of the East, aevoxn
the country and territory ofthe Babylofniansé' There is also the following passage in the LXX.:
Oux :Maiden 'np xopar -qv rxaw Badukung am Xahnyg, ani rf 1|-vgyog gnro3a;4q0v|-H6118 I tw! ldkm I/I8 CDUTIIU
beyond Babylon and C/xalane where the tower was built ? I suspect that Cyril copied from the
LXX. 3 the passages are very similar, and, taken together, tend strongly to contirm my doctrine.
I think the words of Cyril justify me in translating mam as I have done, by the word
BEYOND. Sir William Drummond observes, that Basil and Gregory Nazienzenus make no ob-
jection to the statement of Cyril. The passage in the LXX. is thought by Jerom to be an inter-
polation. This was because it did not suit his hypothesis relating to Babylon being Babel. In
page 132, Sir W. Drummond expressly gives up the opinion that Babylon was Babel; and I beg
it may he observed, that the situation of Chalane is not known ; therefore this opens the way for my
doctrine. At all events Babylon can no
longer be assumed to be Babel, as a
dogma of the religion,
as it appears that the earliest authorities-fathers of the church, do not admit it. There is no
.ioruoarrv for the situation of Chalane. But the passages of Cyril and the LXX. are
authority
for Babel being far to the East of the Babylonian territory.
Chap. II. Sect. v.-Sir W. Drummond says,
"
But as some of the Patriarchs gave their names
to places, and as others were denominated from their habitations, the sacred historian rcal{y gives
us a
geographical as well as a
genealogical table in the tenth chapter of Genesis."1° Along with
the geographical table there is no doubt some genealogy; but it is very doubtful whether a com-
plete genealogical table was meant.
Chap. II. Sect. vi.-The natives call the mountain which the Armemian monks (as Chardin
observes, without any solid proof) call the Ararat, Mas or Mesech. (Travels in Persia by Clsndin,
page 252.) Now in Sanscrit these words mean Moon. I-lima-dri in Sanscrit is the name of Mount
Imaus.
Chap. II. Sect. xi.-The following extract from the works of the celebrated philosopher Adding,
which I discovered when my work was
nearly printed, afforded me no little gratification:
"
The present structure of the earth's surface teaches us what Moses coniirms, that it was
formerly covered to a certain depth with water, which gradually lessened, from causes unknown to
us, so that various spots became dry and habitable. The highest dry surface on the globe must,
therefore, have been the earliest inhabited: and here nature, or rather her Creator, will have
'
ual
planted the first people, whose multiplication and extension must have followed the oontm ,
gradual decrease of the water.

"
We must fancy to ourselves this first tribe endowed with all human faculties, but not posses-
sing all knowledge and experience, the subsequent acquisition of which is left to the natural opera-
tion of time and circumstances. As nature would not
unnecessarily expose her fi;-51; born and
inexperienced son to conflicts and dangers, the place of his early abode would be so selected, that
all his wants could be easily satisfied, and every thing essential to the pleasure of his existence
readily procured. He would be placed, in short, in a
garden or Paradise."
"
Such a country is found in central Asia, between the 30th and 50th degrees of north latitude,
and the 90th and 110th of east longitude (from Ferro) : a
spot which in respect to its height, can
only be compared to the lofty plain of Quito in South America. From this elevation, of which the
great desart Cobi or Slxamo is the vertical point, Asia sinks gradually to all the four quarters. The
great chain of mountains running in various directions arise from it, and contain the sources of the
great rivers which traverse this division of the globe on all sides :-the Selinga, the Ob, the Lena,
the Irtish, and the Jenissey, in the North: the Jaik, the Jihon, the Jemba, on the West: the Amar
and the Hoang-ho (or yellow river), towards the East : the Indus, Ganges, and Burrampooter, on
the South. If the globe was ever covered with water, this great table-land must have first become
dry, and have appeared like an island in the watery expanse. The cold and barren desart of Cobi
would not, indeed, have been a suitable abode for the first people; but on its southern declivity we
had Thibet, separated by high mountains from the rest of the world, and containing within its
boundaries all varieties of air and climate. lf the severest cold prevails on its snowy mountains
and glaciers, a
perpetual summer reigns in its valleys and well-watered plains. This is the native
of rice, the vine, pulse, fruit, and all other vegetable productions, from which man draws his nourish-
ment. Here, too, all the animals are found wild, which man has tamed for his use, and carried with
him over the whole earth:-the cow, the horse, ass, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat .... -
Close to Thibet, and just on the declivity of the great central elevation, we tind the charming
region of Cashmere, where great elevation converts the southern heat into perpetual spring, and
where nature has exerted all her powers to produce plants, animals, and man, in the highest per-
fection. No spot on the whole earth unites so many advantages: in none could the human plant
have succeeded so well without any care."*
On this passage Mr. Laurence remarks,
"
This spot, therefore, seems to unite all the charac-
ters of Paradise, and to be the most appropriate situation in Asia for the birthplace of the
human race."
"
Such is the general result of historical inquiry: it points out the East as the earliest or
original
seat of our species, the source of our domesticated animals, of our
principal vegetable food, and the
cradle of arts and sciences."1~ But the place here selected by those two great natural philosophers,
Adeling and Laurence, is the very place advocated by Baillie and me, for the first nation after the
iloo-d.

Chap. II. Sect. xxvii.-Since the observation made here respecting the curly-headed Budda was
written, I have examined the Gods in the Museum at the India-House; there, many examples of
this God may he seen. He is easily distinguishable from Krishna by his curly head and Hat face.
The latter is not a Negro, though a Black: the lips, in several instances, are
tinged with red, to
shew that they are meant to be those of Blacks.
Chap. II. Sect. xxxvi.-What is said here is confirmed by Sir William Drummond in the second
volume* of his Origines, where hc has shewn, from Moshani Fani and other Oriental historians,
that the countries in the neighbourhood of Maracauda, were formerly filled with great and opulent
cities.
In the Archaologia Lond. Vol. II. p. 222, may be seen some accounts of the remains of a great
nation-very extraordinary tombs, in which large quantities of gold ornaments have been found.
They are situated between the rivers Irtish and Ohelet. The works of Count Staliremhurg may also
be consulted.
Chap. II. Sect. xiii.-The following is the summary of Mr. Laurence's argument:
"
lst, That
the dilferences of physical organization, and of moral and intellectual qualities, which characterize
the several races of our
species, are
analogous in kind and degree to those which distinguish the
breeds of the domestic animals; and must, therefore, he accounted for on the same principles. 2dly,
That they are first produced in both instances, as native or congenital varieties; and then trans-
mitted to the offspring in hereditary succession. 3dly, That of the circumstances which favour this
disposition to the production of varieties in the animal kingdom, the most powerful is the state of
domestication. 4thly, That extemal or adventitious causes, such as climate, situation, food, way
of life, have considerable eEect in altering the constitution of man and animals; hut that this
effect, as well as that of art or accident, is conined to the individual, not being transmitted by
generation, and, therefore, not afecting the race. 5thly, That the human spaies, therefore, like
that of the cow, sheep, horse, and png, and others, is srucuz; and that all the differences, which it
exhibits, are to be regarded merely as 1)GI'i8flh."'|'

"The Druids amongst the Celts were exceedingly addicted to the Pythagorean philosophy, and
Zamalxis, a slave of Pythagoras, by birth a Thracian, was the origin there of this discipline. He,
after the death of Pythagoras, went amongst them and taught them this philosophy. The Celtm
think the Druids to be prophets and prognosticators, because, by calculi and numbers, they
predict some things to them according to the Pythagorean art, of which art I will not forget to
:vention the particularities, since some
persons have dared to
bring about heresies by means of
these things. The Druids also make use of enchantments."1~ Vide Chap. I. Sect. ix.
Chap. IV. Sect. xvii.--For the opinion of the Persians and Etruscans, on the duration of the
creation, the Origines of Sir William Drummond 1' may be consulted.
The author of the article in the Quarterly Review, alluded to in this section, was a
very cele-
brated divine, Dr. Whitaker, of Manchester.
Chap. V. Sect. ii.-I beg the reader to consider what is said here respecting the Himmaleh
Mountains, or lmaus, and then to look at the map. The mighty rivers which dow from this
mass of mountains shew that it must be the highest part of the old world.
Chap. V. Sect. vii.-Since the note in this section was printed, I have examined Herodotus for
the passage respecting Syene, but can nowhere find it. I quoted by memory from the work of a
French author, which I cannot get in London, in consequence of which I fearl have fallen into a
mistake. As it is not in Herodotus, of course the dimculty with respect to him, which I have
taken so much unnecessary pains to remove, does not exist.

doctrines from the oriental schocl. It is very curious that we should lind the foundation of them
here in Ireland. This doctrine, founded on the first verse of Genesis, in fact founded on truth and
nature, was the origin or root of all the succeeding mythologies, varied alittle in India, Persia,
Ireland, &c., but which came at last into very great confusion in Greece, in which state it was
copied by the Romans, who increased the confusion. To suppose that the Druids of Ireland
copied this from the Greeks or Romans is perfectly absurd. Indeed, the thing is impossible, he-
cause the two latter, in fact, neither had it nor understood it. If it were known, as was probably
the case, in their very early mysteries, it had been long lost in the time of Caesar. The Samnn
consisted of the earth, the moon, the five planets, and the sun, uniting with them and constituting
a whole, an octoad. This is what was made ont of the first verse of Genesis, but this verse
gives
no limitation to the number of planets; its expression is general. The devotees, counting only

not compromised by their mistakes.
Ihave said above, that the passage respecting the stars is parenthetical. I beg my reader to
h d that which follows and he will see that the latter is nonsense, if
look to the verse, and t en rea ,
the passage alluded to be not parenthetical; for I assume that no one is so weak at this day as to
suppose that the stars were made merely to give us light.

Now I beg my reader to recollect that the Israelites are declared to be n nation of priests a

May not a

Chap. VI. Sect. xxiv.-The following passages I have extracted from the unpublished manu-
scripts of Bishop Chandler in the British Museum, pointed out to me, with his usual attention and
politeness, by Mr. Cates of that institution. The words which I have put in Italics confirm my
hypothesis, in amarked manner. I confess, aRer my work is printed, I feel no little pride in finding
myself supported by such a man as
Bishop Chandler, whose learning it is needless for me to speak
of. I beg my reader's attention to the parts which I have printed in Italics :
"
The Basque spolce about the Pyrenees (though mixed with many Spanish and French words)
shews the original of this people, and of part of the first inhabitants of Spain.
"
The ancient idiom, mingled with words of the Eastern languages, of Egyptian, Northem, Irish,
and barbarous Greek, joined with a tum conformable to many languages of Tartary and of the
Indies, shew that these people came
by land from the neighbourhood of the Euxine Sea.
"
The Briton, or ancient Celtic, diE'ers from the Teutonic but as a dialect.
"
'l`he Etruscan, Umbrian, and Pelasgian, are dialects of the same barbarous language spoke by
first colonies in Asia Minor, who came from the East of Greece.
"
A collation of all the European languages would prove the petgple came all_/i-om the Eastby the
North ; and that those tongues which have been softened by diferent injkxions since, had them by the
means
of later colonies, that came fiom Aszh Miraor and Greece to Holy.
"
The Basque and several languages of Tartary have a like conformity in the turn and words; as
also with the Indian tongues on this side Ganges. They seem all to be colonies of the same stock,
and others E. of Caucasus, which separates the greater Asia from Armenia to China into N. and S."
[He then goes on to shew that all the languages were
originally monosyllables.]
He says,
"
The genius and turn ofthe American languages are of ajinity with the Tartu:-ian."
Chap. VI. Sect. xxv.-CoL Valleneey says, the Irish have the cycle of the Neros by the name

From this cycle of 600 came the name of the bird Phoenix, called by the Egyptians Phenn, with
the well-known story of its coming to Egypt to burn itself on the altar of the sun and rise again

Caalius Rhodiginus, in his Lecl. Antiq. p. 1286, shews the manner in which was described the

he had 1', which stood for 300, and in the other 5, which stood for 60, and E for 5.
The Greeks, therefore, to express the attribute of the Deity, marked the hand (because the

Therefore Neilos was the solar year, and Lebnos the lunar year.°
Certain it is, that the mystical names of the sun, Abrams, Belenus, and Erecoell, the derivation
of which have so
puzzled etymologists, are no more than words formed of numerals, making up the
number of days in a
year, viz. 365.1-
In the case of the word Emreis, the 1 is obliged to be written with an eta, to make up the
number 365. This is, I think, not correct. That it was intended to describe 365 or 360, can
hardly be doubted. But the eta is a new letter, unknown to the primeval alphabets. The letter
ought to be described by the epsilon. The number was
probably 360, that of the globes at Iona,
and the reason the same, whatever it might be ; probably the number of the lunar year: In each
case we find it closely connected with the cycle of Vrihaspati, 60.1 M. Baillie pointed out
the fact, that' the book of Genesis only makes the year 360 days long. I have dattered
myself that in the irst book we have a work of the primeval nation, the inventors of the
Neros. To this the third, if uncorrupled, can have no pretension. But though the honesty and
care with which the Jews have preserved their sacred book, the Pentateuch, for the last 2000 years,
is above all praise, yet that they intentionally corrupted it after the time of David, can, I think,
hardly admit of doubt ; an opinion in which, I believe, I am supported by some ofthe first divinea
of the Protestant Church.
Chap. VI. Sect. xxvi.-" We see, also, in the modern Arabic and Persic alphabeta, when new
letters were introduced :
though the arrangement was altered, the numerals still held their proper
places. In the modern Persic, Te is the fourth letter, yet as a numeral it stands for 400, the
Tau of the Chaldeans ; and Giim, which is the iifth letter, stands for 3, the value of the Glzimel of
the Chaldeaus. ln the Arabic, Tc is the third letter, yet stands for 400, equal to the Chaldaic
Tau ; Wim is the fifth in order, yet stands for 3," &c. Src. &.c.§
In the first and seventh Chapters I have stated that the original number of letters was 17, and
that they had the names of trees. CoL Vallencey says, on the ancient Samaritan coins are only
found I7 letters.||
Bayer makes the Hebrew letters only 17.1
Walton, Spanheim, Harduin, and Chishull, all agree with Bayer, that the original Hebrew had
only 17 letters.*'*

Again Col. Vallencey says, "This is the exact number of letters in the Samaritan, Hebrew, and
Chaldean alphabets, although seventeen were sufdcient to express all the organs of speech ; for
which reason, iive, which appear to be duplicates, are called addilionals by the learned Bayer, aa
we have already shewn." *
The following observations of the Colonel support my hypothesis of the invention of numbers
and letters in a striking manner. He says, "The Phmnicians had numerals before they had
letters. Their Brat numerals were similar to the Irish Ogham ; marks consisting of straight, per-
d° la lines from one to nine thus, I. il. Ill. llll., Src.; ten was marked with an horizontal line,
pen icu r , ,
thus -; and these they retained after they had adopted the Chaldean alphabetic numerals."1~
1
Col. Vallencey also shcws that the Romans originally used letters for numbers, and these the
letters of the Phmnicians;
There cannot be a
stronger proof that numerals preceded letters, than the Hebrew word WED
spr, sepher, which properly signifies to number, to cipher; numeration, numbering: but after
' '

numerals were applied as literary characters, the same word denoted, as it oes a is ay,

the Latin calculus.

Mr. Hammer, who, probably, never heard of the Irish alphabets or their histories, should find an
Arabian work in Egypt, written as this is, in one of the Beth-luis-nion Ogham, or tree systems
of letters of Ireland.1I

extenduntur.' The great tree in the garden of Eden, whose leaves were letters, and whose
branches were words."*
The ancient Rabbis had a tradition that the Hebrew letters had the meaning of trees, and Col.
Vallencey attempts to give their names; but it is very evident that they are attended with insu-
perable dimculty. His infomation is taken from the old Jewish writers, who appear to give rather
what they surmise, than what they found in the synagogue copies of the Pentateuch. But their
opinion is very important indeed, as a record of an old tradition, and comes in confirmation of my
hypothesis in a manner truly wonderful. It seems that the Rabbis had received a tradition that
the names of their letters had the meaning of trees, which they wished, but wished in vain, to
verify.
In the fifth volume of the Collectanea the reader may see the allegories derived from trees as
applied to letters by the Arabians, which are almost innumerable, and which are, most of them, to
be found in the Irish language. Speaking of the Jewish allegories, the Colonel says,
"And hence the Sephiroth tree, or tree of numbers of the Cabalistical Jews; and this tree
contained ten names, viz. corona, sapientia, prudentia, clementia, gravitas, ornatus, triumphus
confeseio laudis, fundamentum, regnum. The number ten seems to have been fixed on because,
as relating to numerals, ten was called perfection, as from thence all nations began to count anew.
For this reason the Egyptians expressed the number ten by the word mid, that is perfection ; and
the Irish call it deag, a word of like meaning; and for this reason the Chaldeans formed the word
Jod, or number ten, by an equilaterial triangle A, which was the symbol of perfection with the
Egyptians. The Egyptians doubled the triangle thus X, and then it became a cross of St. Andrew,
or the letter X or ten, that is, perfection, being the perfect number, or the number of lingers on
both hands; hence it stood for ten with the Egyptians, Chinese, Phmnicians, Romans, &c., and is
so used with us at this day. The Mexicans also use the same figure in their secular calendars.
The Tartars call it lama from the Scythian lamb, a hand, synonymous to the jod of the Chaldeans;
and thus it became the name of a cross, and of the High-priest with the Tartars ; and, with the
Irish, lunm signihes the head of the church, an abbot, &c. "
Ce qu'il y a de remarkable, c'est que
le grand prétre des Tartares, port le nom de lama qui en langue Tartare signiiie la croir ; et les
Bogdoi qui conquirent la Chine en 1644, et qui sont soumis au dalae-lama dans les choses de la
religion, ont toujours des cvoiz sur eux, qu'ils appellent aussi lamas." T
From this X all nations begin a new reckoning, because it is the number of fingers on both hands,
which were the original instruments of numbering ; hence, "I" fad in Hebrew is the band and
the number ten, as is lamb with the Tartars.1(
Again Vallencey says, "And here, I think, we may trace the origin of the Idmi Dactyli or
Curetes; for Dactylus is only a Greek translation of the Phoenician "I'* (id) iod, as lamh in Scy-
thian, whence the lama of the Tartars."§ .

A ain "
To conclude: It seems to have been universal and natural to man to have entertains
5 s
the idea of numbering from his fingers, and it does not appear extraordinary that, when man led 8"
agrestic life, (as the Cbaldeans and Scythians, the parents of numerals, did,) and had occasion to
carry numbers higher than the number of lingers on his hands, that, before he had assigned arbi-
d' 1 r-
trary marks for numbers, he should have adopted the names of trees, objects imme nate y su

rounding him, some of which grew more
luxuriantly than others; and that, having invented an
arbitrary mark for such a number, he should give it the name of the tree which stood for it _; and
thus, having formed a numerical alphabet, these numerals at
length became letters, as I have
shewu in the preceding pages, still bearing their original names."'*
Chap. VI. Sect. xxx.-Respecting the feasibility of the migration of the deeing Canaanites, I am
tempted to submit a few additional observations. l beg my reader to look at the map and consider
that the climate of the country through which they had to pass, even to Corunna, was so mild, that
they would scarcely sulfer from lodging on the ground in the open air, even in winter. The
inhabitants were, most certainly, their countrymen, or
persons in the strictest friendship and
alliance with them, in the war against the shepherd tribe, which, under Joshua, had driven them
from their country and reduced it to slavery. There is no equally ancient fact in history better
established (independently of all religious considerations) than that of the invasion of Palestine by
'the Arabian tribe under Joshua. The ships to accompany the migrators, would never have to go
out of sight of land till they got to Corunna; so that very poor, ill-built boats would be gui-
cient for their purpose. Some of them might migrate in a
large body from Palestine, as the
Israelites migrated into it: others might go off by degrees to avoid the iconoclastic persecutions of
the Israelites, who had become their masters, and who evidently wished to get quit of the natives.
If the old Grecian histories may be credited, nothing was more common than for the whole of
the natives of a
conquered country to migrate. Upon considering all 'the circumstances, I think
most people will agree with me, that there is no extensive migration on record which would have
been more easy than this, as far as Corunna. The route which they would follow a
great part of
the way was the beaten track which the Carthaginiau followed in their intercourse with Spain,-
the road which Hannibal used when he invaded Italy.
The columns which Procopius says were set up, might either have been a religious memorial, or
they might have been Pharoses, like that at Coruuna,1~ to guide them in
their passing and repassing
of the Strait of Gibraltar; as there must no doubt have been a
great intercourse between those
stopping at Tangiers, and those proceeding into Spain.
There is nothing against the evidence of Procopius, except that, if he were a Christian, he urcnr
invent the story to support his religion. But there is every reason to believe that he was not a
Christian. And this was the opinion of Mr. Gibbon, who under these circumstances is a
very
strong authority indeed. But he must have seen that the style of the story is evidently pagan.
The allusion to Hercules, &c., would never come from a Christian. If this be admitted, it is the
evidence of an unwilling witness, and is unimpeachable. It is not wonderful that the Canaanites
should have desired to get to the British isles, as they would have been well acquainted with them
from their countrymen, the Pelasgi, who must have constantly visited them long before this time.
The philosophical probability is, that the passage of Procopius is genuine, and the story true. The
identity of the Gods of the Canaanites, and of those of the British isles, gives strong additional
weight to the evidence of Procopius. The worship of the Bull in Taurus might be brought by the
first Celtae, and the Gods Mqloch, Baal, &c., by the heeing Canaanites. It is probable that, from a
very early period to the destruction of Carthage, a constant communication was
kept up between
Britain and the East, by the pillar of Hercules, as it is called by Orosius, at Coruuua, and thence
along the coast of Spain and Africa.

After having written this note, I shewed it, pointing out the passage in Greek, to my very excel-
lent and most learned friend, lately of the Rock Assurance Odice, W. Frend, Esq., who instantly
observed, that the expression no
epwmv, was not Greek but Hebrew-a Hebrew idiom answering
t the words 'IDD i Gen. xvi. 8 °
and that no Greek would ever have thought of using those
° mfm 1
words, if he had not been copying an inscription. The justice of the observation I suppose no
Hebrew and Greek scholar will deny. But it appears to me to be a
piece of circumstantial
evidence which removes all doubt of the genuineness of this passage of Procopius, and in a
very
considerable degree coniirms my hypothesis; for I
thinlr it will be admitted, that if I can trace
these fugitives to Spain, there will be no great dimculty in landing them in the British isles.'* I was
at the same time obliged to Mr. Frend forthe observation, that the native Moors (not their Turkish
conquerors) speak the Arabic language. This not only goes far to couirm the truth of Procopius's
account, but it raises a
presumption, that in the days of Joshua the natives of Palestine and Arabia
all spoke the Arabic language. It may he observed, that the farther hack we
go, the less will be
the variation of the different languages of the 17 letter system.
The following is the translation from the Greek of Procopius,-|~ of the whole passage relating to
the Moors, taken from the edition Claudi Maltreti Aviciensis e Soc. Jesu. Paris, 1662.

I now once more request my reader to refer back to Chap. VI. Sect. xxxi., and to consider the
irreproachahle evidence of Diogenes, that the philosophers of the Phaanicians were the same as the
Druids-the evidence of Herodotus, as
expounded by Dr. Parkhurst, that me wg;-d _Drug means
Druid-the Okkals of Mount Libanus and of Ireland, and all the other circumstances which are
there pointed out; and I think he will no longer feel any surprise, that the manners, religion, and
language, of the ancient British isles should have had so
great a
similiarity to those of the meieng
Phcnnicians and Israelites. And I also think, that he will no
longer have any difficulty in finding
the cause by means of which such similiarity was produced,-viz., that an order of priests, under
the name of Druids, was common both to the British isles and to ancient Phcemcia.
