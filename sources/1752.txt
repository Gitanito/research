The symbol upon the cover of this book THE LIGHT oF
EGYPT is complex in meaning. It is the symbol of Spiritual
Initiation, and means, literally, "I have pierced the illusions
of matter, and I am conscious that I am Divine." The seven
stars represent the seven Principles of Nature. The serpent
represents the objective phenomena of life, and the arrow
piercing the serpent represents the human soul which is
conscious of its origin, power and destiny.
The name Zanoni means: -Zan, a star; oni, a child of
or son of; thus Zanoni, son of a star.
The double zee ( ;f1 ) means completion.

PREFACE
For nearly twenty years prior to the year 1881 the author was
deeply engaged investigating the hidden realms of occult force. The
results of these mystical labors were considered of great value and
real worth by a few friends who were also seeking light. Finally, he
was induced to place the general results of these researches into a
series of lessons for private occult study. The whole, when completed,
presenting the dual aspects of occult lore as seen and realized in the
soul and the stars, corresponding to the microcosm and the macrocosm
of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, and thus giving a brief epitome of
Hermetic philosophy as taught by the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor,
Egypt.
The chief reason urging to this step was the strenuous efforts being
systematically put forth to poison the budding spirituality of the
western mind, and to fasten upon its mediumistic mentality, the subtle,
delusive dogmas of Karma and Re-incarnation, as taught by the
sacerdotalisms of the decaying Orient.
From the foregoing statement it will be seen that this work is
issued with a definite purpose, namely, to explain the true spiritual
connection between God and man, the soul and the stars, and to reveal
the real truths of both Karma and Re-incarnation as they actually exist
in Nature stripped of all priestly interpretation. The definite state-
ments made in regard to these subjects are absolute facts in so far as
embodied man can understand them through the symbolism of human
language, and the author defies contradiction by any living authority
who possesses the spiritual right to say, "I know."
During these twenty years of personal intercourse with the exalted
minds of those who constitute the brethren of light, the fact was
revealed that long ages ago the Orient had lost the use of the true
spiritual compass of the soul, as well as the real secrets of its own
theosophy. As a race, they have been, and still are, traveling the
descending arc of their racial cycle, whereas the western race have
been slowly working their way upward through matter upon the
v
ascending arc. In l>~"<.unlx~ ISSO they reached the equator of their
mental and spiritual dcvclormcnt. Also at this time the sun left the
sign Pisces and entered the sigu A<tunrius thus ushcl'ing in the Atomic
Age and a new dispensation of spiritual thought to meet the needs
of tho budding Sixth Hn<il of the fourth Round of humanity. Today,
the wol"ld is experiencing an awakening of the intellectual, religious
und spiritual senses and is nho experiencing the second coming of the
Christ as prophesied in Scripture. Therefore, the author feels this is
the proper time to present the occult knowledge put forth in this book,
during tllis period of change, the gre.1t mental crisis of the western race.
Ha,;ng explained the actual causes which impelled the writer to
undertake tltis responsibility, it is also necessary to stnto most em·
phatically that he docs not wi;h to convey the impression to the render's
mind that the Orient is destitute of spiritual truth. On tho contrary,
every genuine student of occult lore is justly proud of tho snow white
locks of old Hindustun, and thoroughly appreciates the wondrous
stores of mystical knowledge concealed within the astral vortices of
the Hindu branch of the Ary,rn race. ln India, prob-1bly more than in
any other country, arc the latent forces and mysteries of Nature tire
subject of thought nnd stud). But alas! it is not a progressive study.
The descending arc of their ;l>iritual force keeps them bound to the
dogmas, traclitions and cxtcroalisrns of the decaying past, whose real
sccrcts they cannot now pcnrtr:ttc. ·nte ever living truths concealed
hrrwnth the symbols in tlw 111trnllight are hidden from their view by
the selling sun of thcil· >piritunl cycle. Therefore, the writer only de·
sires to impress upon the r·cndcr"s candid mind, the fact that his enrn-
<·st clfor"l is to expose that (>:lrticulnr section of l!uddhistic Theosophy
(esoteric so called) tht\1 would fasten the cramping shackles of the·
ologirol dogma upon the rislog genius of the western race. It is the
delusiv<· Oriental systen>< against which his efforts arc directed, and
not the rare nor the mediumistic individuals who uphold and support
them; for "omnia vincit 'critns" is the life motto of tbe author.
These lessons, on the OCC1rh forces of 1\ature, are from the original
mnnuscripts written son'lc cis:hty years ago by Thom:~.s fl. Burgoyne
for ns<• of members of the E'trrinr Circle of the Hermetic Brotherhood
of Luxor. with the npprm·nl ~r M. Thrnn. tlw Crancl Master nncl his
vi
brotl1er adepts. To these lessons, have been added addjtional material
from other manuscripts and private letters by the same author.
Today, the incoming forces of Nature are rapidly finding new
expression in all branches of scientific thought, long before tl1ere are
any textbooks to show the way. Old thoughts, time and space arc
being annihilated quickly and new truths arc taking root. We are
entering an age of unprecedented intellcctm\l and scientific advance-
ment, many undreamed of changes arc taking place in all walks of life.
In response to the demand for scientific occult tl>ought to meet
the needs of the new dispensation, the knowledge in this book is now
being presented for public use, with the full consent and approval of
the Hermetic Adepts and the Guardians of "The Wisdom of the Ages,"
the Hermetic BrotherhocKl of Luxor, Egypt. It is their prayer that
the thought expressed herein will greatly aid mankind in learning the
real eternal trutl1s of life and thus hasten the day when all nations
wiU join in one universal brotherhood under the fatherhood of the
One Eternal God.
After the 6rst edition published in 1889 Tu£ LICHT oe Ecvt'1· went
through 6vo editions and wa:; pubHshed by Henry \Vngnc•· M.D. under
the name of The Astro-Plo
ilosophical Publishing Company, Denver,
Colorado. It has been out of print for about sixty years. It is hoped
this new edition will receive as hearty a welcome as the early editions.
Please note Mr. Burgoyne's style of expression. This book is not
intended as a literary master~piece~ a pl'oduct of the mind. but is an
earnest attempt to clearly ~nd truthfully express spiritual thought and
ideas in our human language. To change his style is to change the
intended thought. He was an Initiate of Esoteric Ma<onry and a
natural born mystic who "as .able to understand and verify the truth
he teaches in all of his writings; "Omnia Vinci! Veritas" was the life
motto of Thomas H. Burgoyne (Zanoni). it'

THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL
INTRODUCflON
At the very first step the student takes into the hidden pathway
of Nature's mysteries, he is met face to face with this startling fact,
that all his preconceptions, all his education, all his accumulation of
materialistic wisdom are unable to account for the most simple phe-
nomena that transpire in the action and inter-action of the life forces
of the planet on which he lives. As a chemist, he may pursue the
atoms of force until they become lost within the realms of the im-
ponderable, "the great unl:nown," or, as it has been facetiously chris·
tened amid the groans of scientific travail, "the aching void." But he
can get no farther. As a physicist, he may decompose light and sound
into their oomponent parts, and, with scientific accuracy, dissect them
before your very eyes as a surgeon would his anatomical subject. But
no sooner is this point reached, than the shy molecules and timid
vibrations become alarmed as it were at man·s daring presumption, and
By into l\Je realm of the in6nite unknown. There, in "the aching void"
to sport in delight, safe from man's intrusion. This realm of the un-
known imponderables is the universal ether, an infinite ocean of
something, which science created in her f~antic endeavors to account
for the material phenomena of light and beat, and for a time she was
infinitely ple.,sed with her own peculiar offspring. But it has become
a restless phantom, a grim, unlovely spectre, which haunts the labora·
tories of her parc11t, night and day, urttil at last science has become
frightened at her own child, and tries now in vain to slay the ghost of
her own creation. She dares not enter the '"aching void" slie has called
into existence:~ and there J
)llrsue and recapture the truant atoms and
timid vibrations of this sublunary sphere.
Therefore, at the very outset of his pilgrimage through these vast
and as yet ..scientifically unk11own" regions, the student had better
unload, so to say, all the heavy and useless baggage of educated
opinion and scientiJic dogmas that he may have on board. If he does
not, he will find himself top heavy, and will either capsize or run off
the track and be buried amid the debris of conO.ieting opinions. The
2 T ilE l.lc':JIT OF EC\'PT
only cq"ipmcnt that will be found useful, and will repay the cost of
transportntion, is an unbiased rnind) logical reasoning~ genuine common
sense, and a calm, reHective bcain. Anything else for the voyage upon
which we are now ahout to embark, is simply so much usele.o;s, costly
lumber. Hence, so far as modern science and theology are concerned,
the less the student has, the tetter it is for him, unless he can use his
scientific acquirements merely as aids in climbing the spiritual steps
of Occultism. If he can do this, then he will 6od science a most valu·
able auxiliary aid. But this achievement is an exceedingly rare gift,
and one that is seldom found. It is also a most delusive snare, because
nine out of every ten seriously cheat themselves into the belief that
they possess this ability, whereas in reality they are woefull)• deficient.
Hence it is always a safe c<mrse to mistrust the absolute impartiality of
our opinions and reasoning.
Before starting out on such a mighty and in'lportant undertaking,
we must draw the reader's attention to the chief obstacle of the voyage,
and the one which he will have the greatest difficulty in surmounting.
This hidden rock upon which so many otherwise profound students of
the Occult have herome shipwrecked, is the non-rcali~ation of the
duality of truth, viz., the truth of appearances, and the truth of realities.
The former is relative only. B.•t the latter is ahsolutc.
We do not mean merely taking for granted that truth is d ual, and
so ;1sscnttng to the statement; but we mean that the great majority of
Occult students fail to realize this conception within themselves. Know
that; every thing is re.:'ll upon i\s plain of manifestation.
If we possess half of anything, we know by the laws of common
sense and logical reasoning that there is another half somewhere. No
subtle twist of metaphysical sophistry can cheat us into the belief that
we possess the whole when we know and sec that we have just exactly
half and no more. Further, when we look at any known thing we know
that to possess the attribute.~ ofa thing it must possess three dimensions.
viz.; length, breadth and thickness. This being so, we also know that it
has ( broadly speaking) two sides, an outside and an inside. The outside
is not the inside any more than the boiler is the steam which drives
the engine. This logical proce.<.s of reasoning is the only chart that has
so far been prepared for the Occult explorer. It is vague and probably
very unsatisfactory. so far as details nre concerned, but when used in
conjunction with his conscious intuition -the only true compass man
THE SCJENC£ OF TilE SOUL- lNTROUUCTlOX 3
has by which to guide himoself in his winding, uneven path upon the
shores of the Infinite- he never need fear being lost or failing in his
endeavors to know the truth.
In order to carry out the same line of reasoning a little furthcr, let
us take a type of architecture, say the Gothic, and mentally examine
some weU known handsome specimen of this stntctural conception.
The world's thought will say, "what a beautiful buildir'lg; how im·
posing and grand; what a triumph of man's mechanical skill!" So it
appe:ors to the world, and upon the plain of appearances, so it really is.
Consequently, it is a truth for the time being. But when examined
by the light of Occult science, we find this truth is relative only, that
it is only true upon the external, transitory plnne of material phe..
nomena. \Vc sec that, in a·ddition to being the result of man's trained
mechanical ability, it is alsc1
• the external form of his mental ideal. It is,
in fact. the phenomenal outcome of his creative attribute.'\. \Vhen we
look at the solid building,. from the earth's plnne, we see only the
outside of a thing having length, breadth and thickness. Now since
we know that there must be an inside, we must enter the interior plane
before we can see it, and therein we shall find that it exists within the!
subjective world of its ao-chitL-ct. The solid stone edifice will, in time,
crumble to decay. fall, and finally uot one material atom will rcn'lain
to indicate the place whereon it stood. Hence it is not permanently
real. it is only a passing appearance assun1ed by matter under the
moulding forces of m:ln's mechanical nbility. As soon as the forces
which gave it form become polarized by the restless oceans of planetary
magnetism, it will dissolve and finally vanish "like the basele.'s fabric
of a dream.·• But though tlhc cxtemal structure of stone and mortm· is
lost within the soil of the earth, the idea which created it is eternal,
because it was a spiritual .-eality. Therefore, we see that the absolute
u·u th (the eternal realit)'} tt ppears to be the non·rcaHty. upon the plane
of matter, while the material structure appears to be the only thing
which is real. It is these delusive appearances that have created the
almost hopeless confusion regardjng the exact meaning of the terms
"Spirit" and "Matter." Sei•
•nce refers all she cannot grapple with to
some of the undiscovered Forces of "Matter," while theology refers all
that she cannot explain to the unknowable workings of the "Spirit."
Both are right, and both :urc wrong. And as we shall have to explore
the territory belonging to 'both of these terms during the progress of
nu: ucur OF ECYPT
our journey, we will in this place brieOy add that spirit and matter, as
we know them, are but the dual expression of the one Dei6c principle,
due to differences of polarity. In other words, a unity under two modes
of action. This duality can only be comprehended in its true relation-
ship when viewed from both plnncs and reali>.cd by the science of
correspondences, which science is but a material system of symbolism
from which we can justly regulate our conceptions of all things.
Pinto once said, "Jdc~s rule the world." So far Plato was right;
for, before the divine idea was evolved from within the divine sen-
sorium of the Infinite One, the universe was not. Hence the result of
the divine idea was the evolution of a pure symbolic fonn.
Just as symbols are tbc product of ideas, so, in their tum, ideas are
the symbols of thought, and thought itself is but the symbolic response
of the Ego to the pulsating throb of the Dei6c \viU, tl>c divine radiant
soul of the Infinite One. Back of this we cannot penetrate, even in
our most exalted conceptions. Hence all serious study and 1
ncditation
ns to the nature and e.xistence of Cod is unpro6table and cannot bring
the student any substantial return either in tllis world or the next,
seeing that the Infinite can never be comprehended by the Soite.
Therefore, we must rest satisfied with the certain knowledge that we
can by one grand chain of sequences trace the transmission of thoughts,
ideas and symbolic forms to t.hcir source.
Thus the angelic world is but a prototype or symbolic expression
of the divine sphere of the Infinite. The celestial world is n refiection
of the angelic world. 'The spiritual world is a prototype and symbolic
outc'<lme of the celestial heavens. The astral world is the reflection of
the spiritual sphere. And lastly, the material (our world) is but the
concrete shadow of the astral kingdoms.
Hence the reader can perceive that we, in our present state, are
a long way down in the seale of creative life. But if wo are, we know
by the laws of our being that we can and shaU win our way baclc
through this vaUey of tl>e shadow, this plane of inverted images and
delusive appearances, into the bright realms of our former state, those
spheres of pure angelic life where alone exist the ever living reals of
all the infinitude of apparent realities.
THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL-SECTION I
THE GENESIS OF LIFE
CHAPTER I
mE REALM OF SPOUT
Involution
"Being, Uncreated, Eternal, Alone," says Dr. john Young, when
speaking of "the Creator and the creation;" certainly no inspired writer
ever penned a more s-ublime truth than is containe<:l in the above words.
Pure spirit is diffusive,non atomic, uncreated,formless,self-existent
being. Silc:-nt, motionless, unconscious. Divinity; possessing in its sub-
lime purity the one sole Deific attribute expressible in human lang>.tage
as absolute and unconditioned potentiality.
Such is the realm of spirit, which, for the sake of linguistic con-
venience, has been termed by Ute Occultist ''the realm of unmani-
fested being." With the first emanation of this inconceivable state we
have now to deal. The Kabbalah, of the early Jewish rabbis, contains
long and elaborate treatises upon the various emanations of the ten
seph.iroth, which for the most part are written in such an allegorical
style as to be practically useless to most Western students, and even
to Oriental minds arc unsatisfactory, and in many respects misleading.
The first emanation from this realm of spirit (formless being) claims
the student's closest attention. It forms the Deific keynote of the divine
anthem of creation. This first emanation, called by the Kabbalists the
Crown, means, when stripped of its mystical veil, simple and naked
activity or motion. Thus we sec that the first action of Divinity ( un·
conscious mind) is thought, and thought implies vibration or motion.
At the moment tl>e DeiGc mind vibrates with thought there springs
fortla
1 from tJu.; inAuil~ W(JmL of eteatioo, L
he duad of aU future great·
ness. This duad is the Kabbalistical twins, "'Love and Wisdom," which,
in turn mean the attributes, attraction and repulsion of force and
motion. They are male and female, co-equal and co-eternal, and express
themselves externally as activity and repose.
No matter how recondite or abstruse our speculations may be,
when the orbit of our metaphysical meditation is complete we shall
find ourselves face to face again with our original starting point, which
6 TI-l£ U Cirr Ot-' F.CVPT
is this infinite triad of Love, Wisdom and Crown, or, in other words,
the one primal force containing unlimi!ed potentialities within itself.
Back of this we cannot go. With this divine trinity or Godhead, as
students and investigators of Nature's occult mysteries, we must rest
contented, consoling ourselves, whenever necessary, with the certain
knowledge that the nearer we nppcar to approach the great white
throne of the Infinite One, the further does that divine center recede
from us. If this were not so, there could be no such thing as eternity
for the atoms of dillercntiatcd life. Consequently, the irnrnortnlity of
the soul would be an empty dream, a mere figment, hatched by some
infernal power within the o'•
crheated imagination of poor deluded
man.
Before going further, the reader should commit to memory the
following primary doctrines, taught by the Occult initiates of nil true
wisdom. They are doctrines to us in our present state, in so rnr
that we cannot demonstrate them externally by any known fo,·m or
experiment.
I...The \-Vhole universe i.J Rllod with the Dcific ptc3c:ncc or Coc:l."
That is to say, the universe is permeated with the pure, motionless,
formless, spirit of Divinity.
II. ..The universe is boundless and unlimited, a circle whose
circumference is everywhere and whose centre is nowhere." The uni-
verse is dual and consists of the manifest and the non-manifest. Hence
Deity is progressive in his infinite scheme of spiritual unfoldment.
Ill. '"fhe divine one life principle emanates from the pure vortices,
the central Spiritual Sun of the manifested universe. From this mighty
inconceivable center of lifo cmnnate the spiritual ruys of tho F'ather,
scintillating with divine actlvity, whereupon the vast, motionless void,
the nwlul universe of Cod's silent, formless spirit, becomes nlh•
e with
an infinite number of subordinate universes." Which means, the rays
of Divinity are brought to a focus at various points in space. These
points or foci form the spiritual centers of smaller unh•erses. An
example of this can be seen upon our material plane by obscr\•ing thnt
primary suns throw off a series of secondary suns. These secondary
suns throw off planets, nnd the planets become the parents of moons.
lly the science of correspondence, "as it is above, so it is below."
Rcmemher these facts.
THE REALM OF SPIRIT 7
The divine purpose of creation is the differentiation of the uncon-
scious formless One, and the grand outcome of this divine purpose is
the ultimation of Deific Intelligencies; separate minds reflecting the
divine idea of the universal mind, conscious, individualized mentalities
possessing immortal souls capable of eternal progression, who, as dif-
ferentiated life atoms of the Creator, the grand Arbiter of the whole,
become themselves secondary creators and the arbitrators of the
destinies of worlds.
The processes of creation are dual, and consist of Involution and
Evolution. The one is inseparable from the other. Paradoxical as it
may appear to the uninitiated, it is, nevertheless, a divine truth that
the Evolution and ultimation of spiritual life is accomplished by a
strict process of Involution; from the without to the within, from the
infinitely great to the infinitely small.
To better understand this mystery we must have recourse to a
series of symbols. Accordingly, we conceive the divine focus of the
primal essence as the spiritual center of a universe. This Deific ray
constitutes a triune Godhead, from which emanates the pure white
light of the formless One, or in other words, this center constitutes a
realm of sephiroth, a sun-sphere of living potentialities, divine beings
infinitely beyond the highest archangelhood. As such we may conceive
it floating as a speck in the infinite ocean of divine love, surrounded by
the effulgent brightness of the nameless Crown. This divine sphere is
passive in such a state. Nirvana reigns upon the blissful radiance of its
motionless bosom. But the time now approaches when its mission in
the scheme of creation must commence. The moment arrives, and as
soon as the first creative pulsations of thought vibrate, the whole sphere
of motionless, formless, white light flashes forth sparkling with living
energy. And now, behold what a change has taken place. The soft,
white light has ceased to be and in its place there is raying forth in
every conceivable direction Inighty oceans of force; each ocean differ-
ing in velocity, color and potentiality. The passive has become active,
and the motionless has commenced to move, traversing the void of
space upon the wings of light. Deity has become refracted; a portion
of the infinite soul decomposed, and its original unlimited potentialities
resolved into a series of active but limited attributes. This is related
in the mystical language of the Kabbalah as the evolution of the seven
active sephiroth from the first trinity, Love, Wisdom and Crown. It is

THE REALM OF SPffiiT 9
these seven active sephiroth that constitute the seven principles of
Nature. They form seven points or sub-centers around their parent
center, the Spiritual Sun, and are the seven worlds of angelic life from
whose divine matrix issue all the life atoms of their universe.
From the foregoing the reader will see, that when the dawn of
any universe commences, the pure formless essence is indrawn from
the realms of the unmanifested into their sun-sphere of creative life
previous to being involved by the deific will of the angelic hierarchies,
and by such contact it immediately undergoes a change. It is formless
no longer but atomic, and endowed with an attribute or state it had
not before, viz., polarity. This polarity at once evolves a sort of partner-
ship, and equally divides the formless substance into two parts, each
a necessary attendant upon the other in manifested existence. One is
positive, the other, of course, negative. The positive ray is that which
constitutes the living spiritual fire of all things, and its atoms are
infinitely fine. The negative ray is ever tending toward a state of
repose or inertia, and its atoms are coarse and loose as compared with
those of the positive ray. It is the substance formed by the negative
ray that constitutes every species of matter, so-called, from the in-
conceivably fine etherealized substance, which composes the forms
·of the divine archangels of the sun, down to the mineral veins of
dense metal in the earth.
Therefore, when speaking broadly of spirit and matter, the terms
are perfectly unmeaning in an occult sense, for that which we call
spirit is not pure spirit, but only the positive or active attribute of that
which we term matter. Hence matter is so far unreal, it is only an
appearance produced by the negative ray, and this appearance is the
result of polarity or mode of motion; the positive is straight and pene-
trating, the negative is round and enfolding.
With this brief but necessary digression we resume. From the
seven angelic states before mentioned, spiritual involution commences.
Each one of the seven spheres is a reflection of one of the seven re-
fracted principles, which constitute the divine mind of the angelic
creators. From this reflection spring forth angelic races, second only
in mental power and potentiality to their parents. Then, in turn, are
produced still lower celestial states, each state or sphere corresponding
in nature, color and attribute to the sphere from which it was born or
reflected. But though each state in the descending scale is similar by

correspondence. it becomes less in si?.c, more material; the spiritual
potencies of its angelic races are weaker, that is, less active, because
they are more and more involved within matter as they descend in the
scale. Thus docs involution proceed; involving state after state, and
sphere after sphere, forming a series of circles whose line of motion
or descent is not in the plane of its orbit; hence the form ultimates itself
as a spiral until the lowest point is reached. Be)•ond this, motion is,
impossible, and the infinitely great has become the infinitely small.
This is the great polarizing point from which the material world is
reflected. It is the lowest possible spiritual state of life, which fom>
ed
the first ethereal race of human beings upon our planet, and thus
ushered into existence the famous golden age of mythological celebritv.

CHAPTER II
'THE REALM OF MATTER
Evolution
The term evolution is from the Latin e and volvo, which means to
roll from, or unroll, and the evolution of matter means precisely what
the teJm implies, viz., unfolding, expanding, opening and evolving.
The whole of which can be summed up in the word progression.
Matter, per se, is the polar opposite of manifested spirit. It is the
reaction of spiritual action. It is energy in a state of rest. It is force
and rnotion in an exact state of equilibrium• in short, matter simply
means solidified spirit. When two imponderable equal forces from
opposite directions meet each other, both powers become polarized,
force is resolved into inertia, motion is transformed into rest; in other
words, spirit becornes 1nattcr, its refinement or its density depending
upon its degree of etherealization.
The progression and ultunation of the life forces latent within
matter, must bG !lccomplished by a process of unfoldment. The poten-
tialities, in order to expand and put forth their infinite possibilities,
must EVOLVE, and this is so, bec.~use they have become inc.~rnated
by the opposite forces of enfoldment. But having become involved in
the degradation of the material, by the fall, and cast into "the bottom-
less pit" or crystallizing point in space, the only possible means of
return to the original pure spiritual state is through the progressive
cyclic pathways of material unfoldment.
The evolution of matter, like everything else within the realms
of manifested existence, must have some point of commencement. If
matter is, as previously stated, but the manifestation of spirit - the
negative ray externalized and in a state of crystallized inertia- then
matter must be the first offspring of spirit, and both combined must
comprise the all of all things, yea, even Deity itself; for an infinite
creator cannot get beyond hi<creation, nor exist apart from himself,
bec.~use the great law of polar opposites is the direct emanation from
his own divine nature. Consequently, HE must also be governed by
the self same Jaws and principles which control his creative activities,
12 THE UCHT OF EC\'P'r
and when traced to their source we have seen how benutHully simple
such primal laws nrc, viz., "Wisdom and Love." and, convertibly, male
and femolc, positive and negative, activity and repose. Brie8y stated
there is but one law, one principle, one agent and one word. This
sacred law is SEX, a term wherein may be summed up the grand
totalities of the Infinite Universe.
Sex is dual, and finds expression in tl>e phallus and yohni of
animated Nature. This same sexual law operating throughout Nature
limits the sources from which our knowledgeofNature can be obtained;
in other words, there are but two sources from which knowledge o£
any kind is received; one is subjective, the other objective; the former
gives us knowledge of the spiritual or causal side of the cosmos, the
latter gives the material side, which is the world of ol!eets, on account
of its being evolved out of the former, as the poet hath said;
"The outward doth from the inward ro11.
And the inward dwdls in the inmost soul."
The great first cause has evolved out of himself the esoteric, or
subjecth•
c world; and out of tile subjecth·e. by a <impl" cllnnge of
polarity, which at once brings forth a chango of energy and substance,
he has C\'olved the objective world. Therefore, the antecedents of the
obj<-ctive nrc to be found in the subjective world.
We have now completed the cyclic outline of our present research,
and, as n result, we know that the point of commencement in material
evolution which we ha,•e thus for been seeking, lies hidden within the
realms of spirit, of which realm we have already spoken, in chapter one.
In o1
·der to clearly comprehend Nature's processes in the unfold-
ment of matter, a careful study of the seven creative principles is very
necessary, not studied as so many intclligcncies or states of conscious
li£c, but as seven principles or forces, which, though unconscious and
blind in their activities throughout their diJierent spheres or operation,
yet act strictly in harmony with each other as the refrnctcd parts of a
whole, ful611ing the creative design. These seven principles are not in
themselves intelligent, but ru-e simply powers directed by intelligence,
just as the electric current is a power which, when governed by in-
telligence, becomes a medium for the expression of that intelligence
and capable of transmitting its master's thoughts and desires, instan·
tancously, to ony part of the globe that has been prepared to receive
13
them. The intelligence which directs these powers by the laws of
hnru10ny arc the seven angelic worlds mentioned in the previous chap·
ter. and as they nrc n perfect epitome of tl>e divine law, it necessarily
lollows that the objective world of matter must be a perfect epitome-
n solidified expression of its progenitors, and must contain within itself
the latent attributes of its spirih>al source.
Powers. like ind1viduals, are limited in tl1eir nctivities.. For instance,
before electricity c.1n manifest itself as light or power it must have
something to act upon, a point of contact or rapport, at the point or
place of manifestation. As stated in the above illustration of the
electric current, the place and object of such phenomena must have
been prepared for the expression of such power. Hence tho necessity
(if we may use such a te.-m) of the objective world being a perfect
epitome of and containing the latent attributes of the higher and more
interior worlds or cnusc.
If this were not so the perfect evolution of matter would be an
imr>ossibility, because no subjective power, state or principle can act
or rc.
1ct upon an objective form unless a portion of itself lies within
that form. We must carry this line of reasoning a little furtl>
cr.
Man, in his physical body, is a perfect epitome of the planet upon
which he lives, while the celestial worlds find their perfect expression
in his soul, and tl>ese worlds, in tum, arc but the higher and more
interior expression not only of man's physical organism, but of the
earth on which he lives. We see, therefore, how beautifully har-
monious Mother Nnture is, even in her most secret parts. She hns made
every known "tl•ing" dependent upon a something else, and all
thillgs, therefore, are •nutually dependent upon each other. Evolution
is dependent upon involution; the objective upon the subjective, and
man is dependent upon the earth. All contain the same eternal seven
principles; the subj~'Ctive, in its imponderable essences; the objective,
in its solids, Auids and gases; and man, as the spirito.natural medium
nnd meeting point between the two great worlds, treasures up the
seven mineral qualities in his body nnd their magnetic counterparts
in tho odylic sphere of his soul. In this recondite sense alone can we
fully understand the occult axiom of the ancients; "Man t~ a micro-
cosm- a universe within himself.'"
The seven principles of Nature correspond in their chemical affin-
itic' to the seven prismatic rays of the solar spectrum, and also present
14 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
a perfect correspondence to the seven progressive states of manifesta-
tion, which have been very appropriately termed the "The Life
\Vaves." It is these waves of cosmic life energies that carry out the
grand ascending scale of material evolution•.
When a "wave" commences, it, at once, sets in motion, its evolu-
tionary activities. These forces produce a series of responsive vibrations
within that realm of force which forms its material correspondence, and
thus acting and reacting upon each other like the ebb and flow of the
tides, these forces produce another scene in the sublime drama of ex-
ternal life. These waves, seven in number, succeed each other in the
following order;
I. The Spiritual or realm of creation, symbol of The Word.
II. The Astral or realm of design, symbolic of The Idea.
III. The Gaseous or realm of force, symbolic of The Power.
IV. The Mineral or realm of phenomena, symbol of The Justice.
V. The Vegetable or realm of "life," symbolic of The Beauty.
VI. The Animal or realm of consciousness, symbol of The Love.
VII. The Human or realm of mind, symbolical of The Glory.
The student will form a clearer idea of these mighty principles, if
we travel over the same ground again in an explanatory manner;
I. The world of creation signifies the angelic world from which
the original impulse first emanated. This spiritual impulse travels
around the whole of the future orbit of the "system" about to be
evolved, and prepares the spaces for the reception and manifestation
of a less ethereal force.
II. The world of design is the subjective cause-world in the astral
light, containing all the germs, forms and ideals possible for that sys-
tem to ultimate.
Ill. The world of cosmic force is the ever circulating oceans of
mundane, sub-mundane and super-mundane forces, with which
"science" is only just becoming acquainted in the forms of light, heat,
magnetism, universal ether, electricity, and chemical, atomic and solar
energy.
IV. The world of phenomena needs no explanation, it being the
world of matter.
V. The world of life is the fluidic, the first forms of all things, that
is, organic forms "wherein there is life" are vegetables, and they origi-
nate in water, the grand matrix.
THE REALM OF MATfER 15
VI. The world of consciousness. The first rudimentary expression
of consciousness, generally termed instinct, manifests itself in the ani-
mal kingdom. It is intelligent mind expressing itself through the lower
forms of etherealized matter.
VII. The world of mind contains the human principle, Man being
the culminating point of material evolution. In this realm the mind
begins once more to assert its supremacy over matter, here life con-
quers death; hence the very significant symbol of the Kabbalah, where-
in this state is termed "The Glory." See chapters V and VI, La Clef.
The processes of ultimation by the means of involution and evolu-
tion are inversely related to each other; the former (involution) is the
original action, while the latter (evolution) is only the reaction; a neces-
sary consequence of the former.
Before attempting to explain those occult processes connected
with the evolution of matter, which are silently at work within the un-
seen womb of Nature producing the endless series of causes, the activ-
ities of which externalize themselves in an infinite variety of forms, it
is necessary to briefly review the ideas expressed in chapter I, "The
Involution of Spirit," wherein we pointed out that, originally, our solar
system was "without form and void," (Genesis I, 2) that is to say, it
had no material objective shape; that previous to its external manifes-
tation, it must have existed subjectively as an ideal form; and that this
ideal form is but the symbolic expression of the ethereal forces pro-
jected during the evolution of thought. This is as far as we are per-
mitted to go along the line of actual spiritual facts. But in carrying out
the same chain of reasoning, we are led to the conclusion that if we
could only penetrate, even for a single moment, the sacred adytum of
Nature's greatest of all mysteries, we should find that even thought
itself was only due to the throbbing pulsations of the soul, and that
these pulsations, in their turn, were but the sympathetic response,-
the expansion and contraction-of the spiritual respiration in harmon-
ious obedience to the action and reaction of its divine Ego.
The primary ideas which we derive from Chapter I, are as follows;
I. That the macrocosm is the objective image of the divine subjective
idea, and the microcosm is a reflection of the macrocosm. II. That the
former, as a whole, is essentially without form, not only because it
consists of such an infinite variety of forms, but because of the end-
less succession of progressive manifestations of these forms; hence,
16 TilL uc;ur m·· t:CYPT
being witl1out essential fo"n, it is unlimited. 111. That the Inner,
though a perfect epitome of t II<• former, is finite, and as such po«csses
a form .as a symbol of Its lhnitntions.

THE REALM OF MATTER 17
In order that the laws of crystallization may be clearly appre-
hended, we must state at the commencement that crystallization means
death. By death, we do not mean death in the ordinary acceptation of
the term, but we mean the lowest possible minimum in the activities
of force-the state we call inertia. This much being granted, we are
assumed to be at the beginning of our subject, and also of physical
creation.
The first act in creation, according to the Hebrew cosmogony, was
the creation of light, Genesis I, 3., "and God said, let there be light,
and there was light." As we have already seen, the boundless realm of
universal ether containing unconditioned potentialities, requires but
the faintest ripple or impluse of the divine mind to set it in vibration,
and, instantly, there Hashes forth LIGHT, heat, magnetism and molec-
ular force; in short, our universe begins the grand march of cosmic
evolution. The first logical effect of this vibration was light, a disrup-
tive centrifugal force, and its correlatives radiating in straight lines, in
all possible directions from a center, while from each line of force
minor rays radiate at every possible angle to the axial ray. We have,
thus, at the very outset of our conception, a complete and perfect net-
work of rays, or lines of energy, moving at the rate of light, 185,000
miles per second through the formless, motionless, ethereal, medium
of space.
It will help us in our conception, if we call to mind the fact that
matter, to produce in us the sensations we refer to matter, must possess
at least three dimensions, viz.; length, breadth and thickness, and each
of these dimensions requires at least two equal forces for its expression;
also, that all these six equal forces must be concentrated upon a single
impenetrable atomic point, and, lastly, this impenetrable atomic point
must also consist of two equal forces. Therefore, to produce a single
grain of solid matter, a solitary minute crystal, it requires the complete
polarization of eight rays of cosmic energy.
Our first duty, then, is to discover our impenetrable atom. When
two equal forces coming from opposite directions meet each other,
both become polarized, a state of inertia is produced, and an atom, a
veritable material atom, is the physical result of this change of energy.
From the infinite network of rays produced by the first vibrations of
light, it is easy to conceive of the instantaneous evolution of an un-
limited number of material atoms from the equally unlimited number
18 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
of opposing rays of force. Now, we have our necessary atom, which,
after all, is nothing but an unknowable something.
This polarized something, however, gives us the first dimension
of material forms. It is a point in space, and if we now take two more
equal forces at this polarizing point, we have another atom, which,
although it gives us nothing in the form of a solid, yet will supply us
with the second dimension, viz., a straight line or a point extended by
Fig. 1 Fig. 2
an additional point. Let us now take our impenetrable atomic point,
consisting of a single atom, and suppose that four equal forces are
concentrated upon it, one from the right and its opponent from the left,
one from above and its opponent from below (see fig. 1), and there-
sult is, we possess an ideal form, but still no solid; we have both length
and breadth, but no thickness, hence it is only a higher form of the
second dimension. But, instead of four, let us now suppose that we
have six equal forces concentrated upon our impenetrable atomic
point. In addition to those which come from above, below, right and
left, we have two more which come from the rear and the front. (see
fig. 2) Force 1 comes from the right, its opponent 2 from the left; 3
comes from above, its opponent 4 comes from below; 5 comes from the
rear, its opponent 6 comes from the front. Now, what is the result? We
have length, breadth and thickness; we have six equal side~; and our
unknowable atomic something has become transformed into an ulti-
mate molecule, whose crystallized substance is a cube. It has all of the
elements of a solid form, though it can be measured only by the imagi-
nation, since microscopes are not yet powerful enough to reveal the
first original forms of crystallization. Man's physical senses are too dull
to perceive such things but it may be this atomic age will produce
some electrical or atomical instrument sensitive enough to detect an
original atom of matter. But such wonderful transformations as take
THE REALM OF MATTER 19
place can be seen only by the eye of the spiritual soul whose piercing
sight can penetrate the mysteries of Nature's Workshop, the astral
light. It is from this source that the principles contained in the above
illustrations were obtained.
We see, therefore, that logically it requires six equal forces, meet-
ing at an atomic or impenetrable point, to produce solid dimensional
matter. It may, of course, be many more than six, just so they approach
in pairs from opposite directions. The only difference would be in the
form of the crystal. By keeping in your minds that the atomic point
can be made by forces from all possible directions, you will see that
as the possible angles are infinite, so the possible crystals are infinite,
all in strict conformity to the mathematical law, "each kind of crystal
is the type of the substance it forms."
So far, we have spoken only of the three external dimensions recog-
nized by science. There are seven dimensions, in all. In this chapter
we shall speak only of the fourth, which was first introduced to the
notice of science by Prof. Zollner, in his "Transcendental Physics." No
matter how solid any external object may appear, it is not so, for every
molecule of which it consists forms an extremely small atomic system
of satellite atoms, revolving around their one primary atom, which
forms the impenetrable point of every crystal. There is space between
every one of them. It is these unoccupied spaces that form the fourth
dimension of matter. Note; the above was written some seventy years
ago, now that our atomic age is getting into the serious study of the
hidden forces of Nature all sorts of undreamed of phenomena are being
brought to light. Only time will show how far man may go in exploring
the universe.
To de-materialize objective matter and resolve it into its original
elements requires the application of an external force powerful enough
to polarize the cohesive affinity of the atoms. If in the de-materializing
process, electricity is the force used, the form is destroyed, as far as
the external plane is concerned. This change releases atomic energy.
But, if the force is magnetic, the object is only etherealized, and in
this state matter can be made to pass through matter, and the instant,
the magnetic dissolvent is withdrawn the object will reassume its
original objective shape.
We need scarcely add, that, in this natural fact lies the secret of
spiritual materializing phenomena of modern spiritualism, and it forms
20 Ttlt UCHT OP EGYPT
the true foundation of all magical manifestations of a ph)•
sical nature.
A strong physical medium, Cl"en though a helpless tool under the coo·
trol of n ''ery questionable class of invisibles, can produco phenomena
equnlly as well as the Uvin~ ndcpt. The only dilfcrcnc<· is, that, the
mcdhun cannot contro1either the spirits or the pllcnomonn, whereas
the ndept commands both nt will and thus accomplishc.~ his desire. Of
nil creatures, MAN alone, hns tho Cod given ability to consciously de·
v~lop his spiritual senses (become no Adept, truly understood life) so
as to be able to use them in observing the operations of the true laws
of life and thus learn the causes of what we experience here on earth.
If righUy used, this occult knowledge could corroc:t many human
errors, raise the moral aod spiritual standards of men and thus aid in
the actual C.<tablishmcnt Of n sincere fraternal sOCiCt)• of all men lierc
on earth.
lf it were possible to reduce magical science to n technical
fonnula the following wouhl he, within certain limits, scientifically
correct; "'As the density of tltc utoms is to the mass of the substance,
so is the power of cohesion to the forrn of the article." Master that
magical receipt and you will hf. :.hit' tn work wond~>r~
From the principles cluedntcd in this chapter, the reader will per·
ceive that if all the forces of the universe were balanced. the external
result would be a complete stop in the prog=sive work of creation.
The variety of substance would he endless: there would be an infini-
tude of crystals, and our earth would be nothing but n dead crystalli7.ed
sphere. All forces, when bnlnnccxl, make crystals, but no motion. Crys-
tallization is the negat-ion of motion. It is death. In our next chapter,
our energies will be dircctrd toward the polar OJ
lpositc of tho inert
crystal, therein will be disclosed the origin of physical life.
CHAPTER III
THE· ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL LIFE
"Mighty oaks fr~m little acorns grow."
When we speak of the genesis of life, we must be understood to
mean "the origin of physical life" and not the genesis of life within
the divine super-celestial sphere of God's infinite creation.
Man, his constitution, from whence he came, and whither his
cyclic journey will carry him, is all that embodied man can hope to
understand during his sojourn upon the external planes of matter. The
exalted adept craves no more, in fact he cannot obtain any absolute
knowledge beyond this, because it is impossible for him to realize
anything beyond himself. The perfect man, while incarnated within
the astral vortices of humanity, cannot pentrate and know the details
of truth belonging to the purely angelic state. Before he can do this
he must be forever translated from the astral sphere of the planet
which gave him birth, and, he himself, become the angel. The
mightiest hierophant (Hermes Trismegistus) this world has ever pro-
duced has only been able to speculate as to details within these
exalted states, and such speculations without corroborative testi-
mony, are as valueless, when used as the foundation for a system of
thought, as the speculations of any religious enthusiast. The only
difference between the two consists in the different planes occupied
by the respective speculators.
The involution of spirit, and the re-active ~volution of matter,
are based upon absolute laws, which man may realize for himself.
That one form disappears only to give place to another more perfect,
is a fact observed throughout Nature in all her departments, and those
who possess the attributes of soul-sight in a sufficiently developed
state, can perceive the hidden potentialities latent within the outward
form. This being so, and we assert of our own spiritual experiences
that it is true, then we know that previous to this evolution which we
can distinguish taking place all around us, there must have been a
process of involution, by which these latent potentialities became in-
volved within external matter. From nothing, nothing can be pro-
22 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
duced; it is therefore only the blind, unreasoning atheist who can credit
such an illogical creed as the one which has been thus summarized,-
"From nothing we came, and whatever our station,
To nothing we owe an immense obligation.
Whatever we do, or what~ver we learn,
In time we shall all into nothing return."
To the cold, heartless supporter of this soul annihilating system of
nothingness, who flaunts his superficially learned authority under the
plausible name of Agnostic, we reply with the fully realized con-
sciousness of a deathless, progressive immortality,-
From an infinite source midsll realms of light,
An offspring from God, my soul took its flight;
To gain amidst matter, with its trials and pain,
The knowledge to carry it homeward again.
The immutable laws of Nah1re may be traced backward into
remote eras of sun formation, or carried forward beyond the purview
of the present into the equally dim vistas of the eternal future, by
those who can see and realize for themselves the planes of both cause
and effect. To be able to do this we must attain unto the soul state of
equilibrium where both realms unite, where there is neither cause nor
effect, but where the two are one. It is from such a state that the
teachings contained in this work were derived, and as such we desire
them to be closely studied.
The genesis of life must be viewed from the seven planes of its
manifestation, to be thoroughly understood. These planes, taken in
the order of their cyclic evolution, are as follows; I. Celestial; II. Spir-
itual; III. Astral; IV. Mineral; V. Vegetable; VI. Animal; VII. Human.
From the seventh or human state the life atoms again pass through
the astral and spiritual to the celestial; the complete cycle of necessity
being composed of ten great cycles, corresponding to the well known
Kabbalistical "Sephiroth." At present, we shall only speak of I, IV,
and V, these three constituting the foundations from which the others
arise.
I. The Celestial State
Of this state it is impossible to give more than a general outline,
containing, as it does, the mystery of those inconceivable laws, by the
operation of which the Ego becomes a self acting entity. It must
THE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL LIFE 23
suffice to say, that it is this state of celestial life wherein is located the
purely embryonic center in the divine arc of progressive being.
This is the point where the diffusive intelligence of the infinite
spirit becomes differentiated and atomic; yes, we repeat the word;
the divine Ego of the human soul is absolutely atomic. It is a self-
existing absolute atom of Jehovah-God, (a Christ Child) which it is
impossible to alter, transform, absorb or annihilate, from the supreme
moment of its differentiation. It is as eternal and immortal as the
infinite, of which it forms a part. But though atomic, it is only so as
a purely spiritual conception, a point of radiant light, free from matter,
and incapable of uniting itself with it except by means of reflection.
The process of differentiation now claims our attention. This pro-
cess is consummated within the celestial matrix of angelic parents.
By "angelic parents" we mean those divine entities who dwell within
the various spheres of purified angelhood.
NoTE: We do not use the term angel in the sense implied by ordinary lexi-
cographers, who interpret the word as "a spirit, servant or messenger," but we use
it to mean the highest and most interior state of life which it is possible for mortal
mind to grasp. It is infinitely above the so-called spiritual sphere.
The twin souls, male and female, or heavenly Osiris and Isis,
(father and mother) form two halves, the masculine and feminine
attributes of the divine Ego. They have their alternate cycles of ac-
tivity and respose. During the cycle of their fruitful activity, the two
natures respond with intense vibrations to the divine anthem of crea-
tion which creates an influx of the formless, motionless spirit into the
celestial sensorium until the whole sphere becomes radiant with the
scintillations of spiritual harmony. Obeying the creative impluse, these
streams of spiritual force flow along the convergent poles from the
various centers of the sphere, each force from the male being met
and balanced by that of the female, the contact producing, by the
exact equilibrium of the masculine and feminine natures, the living,
external sparks of immortal life. In other words, these angelic vibra-
tions transform the formless intelligence, which has been indrawn,
into active eternal Egos. As man on earth is the natural outcome of
the procreative powers of earthly parents, so the divine activities of
the Ego are the spiritual results, in one sense, of the creative attributes
of angelic progenitors in the celestial worlds. But we must not be mis-
understood upon this point. The Ego is not created in the angelic
THE l.ICHT OF ECYirt'
state; it is onl)' differentiated. The Ego never had an actual genesis; it
is coeval with Deity. The <
:e lcstial harmony or vibrations merely en4
dowed it with spiritual actlvi ty, aroused it from its unconscious state)
and propelled it forward with the motion of eternal life.
These nc.wly differentiated atoms remain withil1 the paternal
soul sphere until the vibrations have ceased. The)' then become at4
tracted by the reactive cnerg:y, and are withdrawn from thcil· celestial
matrix and carried by the spirit1.1al currents to the embryonic state of
the Seraphs. Their next descent is to the paradisiacal worlds of the
Chcn•bs, where the bisexual Ego becomes the Adam and Eve of Scrip-
ture. In the process of tim•2', these pure twin souls, unconsciously
obeying the internal impluse: of their evolutionary tempter, become
attracted towards matter. Up to this point they are pure and innocent,
knowing neither good nor e·vil. Therefore the divine Ego, which is
incapable of descent into matter, projects the two souls outward as
spiritual monad s into the vortex of co~mic evolution, where they be4
come separated and ultimate·ly incarnated within the mineral round
of a planet, which is the low~st point in the arc. In making this de-
scent each monad passes through cv('ry state: in the soul world. then
through each of the four reallms of the Astral Kingdom before it ap-
pears in the external mineml plane. In this state they constitnte tl>

origin of its motion- its life-·since we know that within the mineral

26 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
it will be as well to see if the vegetable kingdom will substantiate our
assertion. As some sort of external evidence, then, let us call to our
aid the phyllotaxy of plants (as it is technically termed). On the stems
of plants the leaves are so placed that a line wound around the stem,
and touching the petiole of each leaf, would be a spiral. Where the
leaves are in two rows, the space between two opposite leaves is just
half a circle or circumference of the stem, and where there are three
rows, it is one-third of the circumference, and so on to a regular suc-
cessive series in different plants which express the ratios of 1-2, 2-5,
3-8, 5-13, 2-21, 13-34, 21-55. The external facts, demonstrated by
botanical science, not only confirm our assertion, but also tend to
show that vital force is subject to measurement in the plant.
In order to understand how the vegetable evolves from the min-
eral, not only must the spiral motion of life be held in view, but the
various changes of atomic polarity must also be clearly apprehended.
As, for instance, the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen by a certain com-
bination produce water. In this union both become polarized, and
form a substance which is the polar opposite of their original inflam-
mable states. From this change of polarity we have clouds, oceans
and rivers. When the vapor from these waters is drawn upward by
the heat of the sun, an infinitely small fraction becomes decomposed
into its gaseous state. Although decomposed, the atoms are actually
the same as they were previously, after combining in the substance
known as water. They have only received a different angle of motion.
Whereas before they rotated in a circle, they now ascend and revolve
in the form of a spiral. In this ascension from earth they attract or are
attracted by the atoms of carbonic -acid gas, and instantly a violent
rotation among the various atoms is produced. They combine and lo -
another transformation has taken place; a new thing has been pro-
duced, viz.; a molecule or germ of physical life. Under the control
of a central atom of fire, the predominating forces being oxygen and
carbon, this union produces another change of polarity, and they be-
come re-attracted to the earth. Here, water or moisture receives them,
and a species of vegetable slime is the physical result. When this
vegetable product has served its purpose and decays, its liberated
atoms arise in their spiral and, in tum, become attracted, or themselves
attract, some one or more of the atoms of air with which they have a
natural affinity. The same process of polarization is repeated, with
THE ORIGIN OF PHYSICAL UFE 27
some slight variation, and a still higher germ of life is evolved, viz.;
the lowest form of the lichen. From the liberated atoms of the lichen
spring forth still higher types of the same family until the climax is
attained, when, by a higher and more ethereal a~traction, the polar-
ized germs bring forth the next higher form of vegetable life. Thus,
as the ages roll on, from this original form develop species, classes,
and families of vegetation, and from these evolve, through the medium
of water, a still higher round in the gamut of being; insect, reptile,
animal, and lastly, MAN. After ages of development, we have Man of
today.
Space will not admit of our going into further details of this ex-
ceedingly interesting subject. Volumes might be filled in recounting
the writer's personal experiences in this department of life, watching
with intense interest the weird but beautiful transformations of Nature.
Much that has been left unnoticed here, should be made the subject
of the student's private meditation, and personal research.
CHAPTER IV
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX '
It has been well said by an eminent Occultist, "man is most
ignorant of those things which are most manifest."
In some departments of Nature this is true, and probably in no
other "manifested" department of his being is this truth more strik-
ingly apparent than in that which relates to his sexual nature. He is
aware that animal nature is divided into two great classes, male and
female, but he knows almost nothing of the spiritual principles which
underlie this physical expression of sex. He is fully aware that the
union of the two organisms is necessary for the purpose of procreation,
but he is fearfully ignorant of those interior processes which produce
the actual germs of life. He is more or less acquainted with the fact
that in the lower stratas of animated existence bi-sexual organisms are
the general rule, and that, occasionally, this bi-sexual nature becomes
manifested among men, as seen in the hermaphrodite, but he is quite
at a loss to account for such "monstrous" productions. Hence it may
be truly said that "man is most ignorant of those things which are
most manifest." Therefore, in order to enable the general reader to
clearly grasp the various connecting links in the mystical ramifications
of sex, to see their perfect harmony, and to understand their relation
to each other, we will first speak of the origin of sex; secondly, describe,
as clearly as possible its nature and functions; thirdly, point out the
relation of the sexes to each other; and, lastly, present a brief appli-
cation of the whole as it relates to Man, the Universe, and .the Immor-
tality of the Soul.
I. The Origin of Sex
Deity is a unity that expresses or manifests itself as a duality.
This is the eternal trinity of life.
The infinite ocean of formless spirit within its latent bosom con-
tains all that is, was, or ever can be. Therefore it contains all the ele-
ments of sex in their primal state. When the first pulsations of that
thought which evolved "the divine idea" became manifest, Nature
arrayed herself under the two modes of motion, action and reaction.
TH£ M\"ST£1\JtS Of' St:."< 29
The in-breathing and out-breat.hing of this divine thought, in the
earliest dawn of creation, thus instituted the first spiritual attributes
of sex. Each function of the Deific soul, wbich we designate as in·
spiration and expiration, or action and reaction of the univers.'l life
current, thus hec.•me differentiated for all eternity as the primary
fundamental principle of Mnmfested l~eing. The Kabbalistical initiates,
or tho ages thnt :li'C gone, formulated this SRIIlC biunc spirit as LO\'e
and \ Visdom. Love, as the negative or feminine my, is content and
ever seeks to enfold. Wisdom, as the positive. rnnsculine ray, is rest·
less and nlwnys in pursuit. The feminine forces nrc ever StJ'iving to
encircle the atom, and the masculine forces striving to propel it in a
straight line. From this dual nction of the spiritual potentialities, is
bol'll the "St)iral," the motion of life and symbol of eternal progression.
We cannot attempt any explanatiool of how the first DeiGc forms
of >CAual life become ultirnattd, nor of the why and wherefore of this
celestial cxistcnet'. It is cn<><•gh for us that \\C arc cnahk-<1 by the laws
of correspondence to trace the origin of >C.< to the shores of the great
fountain of all existence. and to proclaim it to the world as the first
principle of that great centr::tl Ego (God ) from which all manifested
egos derivo:- their being. ln onler that we ma)' comprehend somewhat
of the mysteries of sex as we see them manife>tcd in humanity, we
must descend from these practically inconccivabh• heights of celestial
gloo
y and seek for the linh of this continuous chain within the high-
est stales of lifo npproachable by the embodit-d human soul, viz., the
angelic sphere of the soul world. Only in these states can we obtain
any definite idea or the interior significance of sex, and its mighty
importance ns a fact1>r in the immortality of tbe human soul. The f.rst
link of tbis celestial chain, as we have seen, lies concealed within the
bo,,om of the Jn6nite One. What the succeeding ones may contain we
'"'nnot tell, but that they will bear a perfect correspondence to the
angeHc state we are certain, making due aUowancc for the difference
of their respective stntes. Thtrdore, since we know the origin of se.'{,
we will consider its correlatives which we have designnted. as inspir-
ation and expiration.
U. Sex, Its :'llaturc and Functions
In the previous chapter we have described in a very brief manner
the actual differentiation of the human Ego, as n dciGc atom of life.
30 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
We need not, therefore, repeat any of the description there given, but
we will add that it must be a self evident fact that each Ego contains
within itself all the primary elements of sex, in a latent condition. These
attributes have not as yet been subjected to the requisite conditions
for their evolution. In this state, then, there is neither love nor wisdom
manifested within the Ego. It cannot know happiness when it is
ignorant of sorrow. It cannot form any conception of rest before
weariness has approached. There can be no real love for the Ego when
it has never experienced the various contrary conditions by which love
is distinguished. The wisdom of the Ego in this state is equally latent,
since it possesses no means of arriving at a true knowledge of its var-
ious surroundings. In this state, we behold the spiritual atom in its
primal condition wherein the power of God hath just created it. It
is the first spiritual Adam. The various series of states through which
this divine Ego must penetrate in order to evolve its soul sphere, are
the necessary means by which the internal potentialities of sex must
be awakened. When this transpires, the divine Ego becomes pregnant
with the dual forms of its own organic life, and the twin souls are
born, the male and female elements of its being, which are represented
in Genesis as Adam and Eve, knowing neither good nor evil. A beauti-
ful description this of the embryonic human souls. These twin souls
are the absolute expression of the masculine and feminine rays of
which every absolute atomic Ego is composed. The masculine ray
contains a portion of the feminine elements or there could be no re-
action of its forces. The feminine ray must likewise contain a portion
of the masculine qualities for the same reason. These twin souls con-
tain a portion of each other. They constitute the sun and moon, so
to say, of the Ego's creation, and when once they become differentiated
they are as eternal and immortal as the EGO which called them
into existence. They can be neither absorbed nor annihiiated by time
nor eternity. They constitute the divine idea of their deific parent,
and as such they become the divine expression of Love and Wisdom
upon this earth.
• 1'\oTE: This statement requires some slight qualification. We mean that no foreign
or outside influence can absorb or annihilate the sexual qualities of the soul. It
is therefore true that the masculine and feminine attributes of the soul cannot be
destroyed as a whole. But the masculine portion may attract its feminine portion
or soul mate, and by the intense selfhood of its own dominant forces virtually
destroy her manifested existence. This absorption however, is a very rare be-
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 31
currence and only transpires in the case of those magi,.,al adepts of the astral
plane who have attained their psychological powers by a complete polarization
of all the truly human elements of their internal natures. Such magical adepts
become the concentrated centers of spiritual selfishness, but teach the external
masses that self is the very demon they have conquered. These occult processes
have transformed them into sexless beings, who are neither human nor divine,
and yet they profess to be the guardians of "the secret doctrine" of "the sacred
science."
In this latter capacity they have formulated much erroneous philosophy,
since they are self-magnetized and self-deluded by their own positive idea of
Nature to such an extent that they cannot penetrate beyond their own astral spheres,
nor receive any knowledge which elevates the soul to higher views and truer con-
ceptions of God's infinite resources. It is from this magical school of thought that
mankind have received the doctrines which teach that sex is only the appearance
of matter, and not a spiritual reality; whereas, nothing in this mighty universe
is so manifest and so eternal as the male and female expressions of the divine soul.
These adepts profess to have blended the two; but they have simply polarized the
feminine, and created a conscious selfhood of the other.
It is impossible for the absolute Ego (the twin soul) to descend
into more outward conditions than the paradisiacal state. So in order
to attain the full development of its internal attributes, its own soul,
expressed as the male and female elements; each unit is projected
outward upon the subjective arc of the great cycle, where, after
passing through innumerable spheres and states of life, each finally
reaches the polarizing point of creation, in the mineral, which is the
turning point in its cycle of necessity. From this point its journey
back again is traversed upon the objective arc until it reaches the
climax of material forms.
We see, therefore, that the nature of sex is to give perfect expres-
sion to the two grand attributes of deific life; Love and Wisdom; that
to attain this end the divine soul of the absolute Ego becomes dif-
ferentiated as male and female, each conscious of itself, each a perfect
expression of the positive and negative forces of its being. When once
this differentiation is completed, then, they exist as the divine idea of
the microcosm and constitute its universe, even as the myriad creations
of space constitute the divine idea of the Deity. This being so, each
portion of the dual soul maintains forever the perfect symbol of its
internal qualities and always gives expression, in its outward form, to
the symbol of its internal nature. Like produces like.
The function of the soul is to awaken and round out those qualities
and attributes which are latent within; and as we have seen that there
are two sets of soul qualities, one the necessary outcome of the other,
we see the harmony and the philosophy of the twin forms of life
32 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
to express them. Both male and female, as we have endeavored
to show, possess the necessary positive qualities for the perfect subju-
gation of material forces. Hence it is, that, when the twin souls are
projected on their journey into matter, they travel upon divergent
lines, along the subjective arcs of the soul's evolution. These lines (if
it were possible to measure them) would form two sides of an equilat-
eral triangle with mineral as a base, while the apex would indicate the
absolute Ego or point of projection. The return journey between the
mineral and man forms a similar triangle, in reverse, which would indi-
cate the objective arcs of the soul's evolution. When both arcs are
combined they represent the mystical seal of King Solomon, the
double trinity, or six pointed star. This completes two acts in the
grand drama of life. The closing tableau in the first act represents the
stationary forces of the crystallized mineral and the second act the
external conditions of human life.
Man
Objective Arc Solomon's Seal
The third and last act in the human cycle briefly reviews the
whole of the previous two arcs and evolves another six pointed star
which represents the higher and lower planes of manifestation. (This
last act is the transit of the soul through the seven super mundane
spheres of disembodied existence from man to the angel.) But, in its
grand outlines it is also a spiritual trine whose closing tableau repre-
sents the reunion of the twin souls symbolized by St. John as the
celestial marriage of the lamb. Thus, we begin with the one divine
monad or Ego and in the course of its expression and of the gradual
evolution of its sexual attributes, we see it slowly transform into a
trinity. This trinity, in the sub-cycles of its evolution, forms three tri-
angles, which constitute the symbol of its forces three times expressed
upon the three sub-cycles of its journey. These three sub-cycles are the
subjective arc or the cycle of unconsciousness, the objective arc or
cycle of intelligence, and the ethereal arc or cycle of soul conscious-
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX ,33
ness. The results so far of our present research show that the origin
of sex begins with God; that the nature of sex is the manifestation of
his biune spirit, and its functions are the spiral motion of its evolution-
ary forces that awaken and round out its latent possibilities.
It now becomes our duty to consider the third section of our
subject, the relation of the sexes to each other.
III. The Relation of the Sexes to Each Other
Male and female exist in Nature as the representative expressions
of wisdom and love. Their functions correspond exactly with their
sex, and in actual life it may be truly said that woman is ever the
center of the love element of humanity. Her thoughts and desires
constitute the index of her mission on earth. In her, we behold the
gentle, yielding, loving nature which softens and harmonizes man's
positive spirit of aggression. In her delicate nature we see the lovely
center of maternal care and affection. She is the weaker portion of
the dual soul upon the physical plane, but her physical weakness con-
stitutes the great center of her spiritual strength. As the weaker sex,
we may think that her true place is that of subjection to man, but, on
the contrary, her more delicate forces become her most potent weapon,
and instead of being the subject she ascends the throne of the con-
queror. Man becomes a pliable medium in her hands, and is led a
willing captive by her subtle power and resources.
In man we behold the positive, aggressive Lord of Creation, that
portion of the soul which becomes the restless explorer of Nature
seeking for wisdom. Man's will is electric, penetrating and disruptive.
The will of woman is magnetic, attractive and formative. Hence they
express the polar opposites of Nature's forces.
The twin souls are related to each other primarily as brother and
sister, and finally as man and wife. In this latter state their true meet-
ing place is the plane of embodied humanity, but, during the present
cycle, very few of these spiritual unions take place. But, whenever
the two halves of the same divine Ego do meet, love is the natural con-
sequence; not the physical sensations produced by the animal mag-
netisms of their sexual natures, but the deep, silent emotions of the
soul; the responsive vibrations of their internal natures toward each
other; the blissful silence of two souls in perfect rapport wherein
neither careth to speak. This spiritual love is the outcome of their
34 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
divine relationship, and should never be set aside nor crushed by any
worldly considerations. But, on the contrary, wherever possible, these
pure intuitions of the soul should be obeyed. They cannot deceive
nor lead astray, because the soul never makes a mistake when claiming
its own.. Should circumstances in life or any other material considera-
tion prevent their rightful union, the fact that they have actually met
will constitute an invisible connection, a spiritual rapport, between
them which no earthly power or device can break. Deep down within
the secret chambers of the heart the image of the loved one will be
treasured and its continual presence will poison and corrode everything
which pertains toward an ephemeral affection for another. If a female
should marry under these circumstances, and become the mother of
children, it will frequently transpire that the actual germs of spiritual
life will be transmitted by this absent one. The external husband only
provides the purely physical conditions for the manifestation of the
spiritual offspring of the true Lord. The rejected soul-mate, the spir-
itual bridegroom, is the real father, and very often the child born will
resemble the image of its true parent.
By far the most important of the various relations of the sexes
toward each other is that which pertains to their sexual intercourse.
Untold misery, suffering and crime are born into the world through
the sensual depravity of mankind on the one hand, and their benighted
ignorance of human nature upon the other. We are sorry that such a
delicate subject cannot be properly treated in the present work, so we
will only add that man and wife should harmonize with each other,
both in physical temperament and in magnetic polarity. No marriage
union should be thought of where these essential points of comparison
are wanting. Neither wealth, fame, nor worldly position, can compen-
sate for the lack of natural harmony. Discordant unions are the har-
bingers of sorrow, crime and disease. Sexual union between inhar-
monious souls evolves the seeds of every species of wickedness and
sexual disorder. It may not become apparent to the producer thereof,
but it exists within the spaces of human life ready to spring into con-
crete form under the first favorable conditions.
Let those who deliberately misuse their sexual nature, to satisfy
licentious wicked desires, stop in the deadly path. Such thoughts and
actions lead to madness and actual death.
The purely Martial man will prove a continual curse to the cold-
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 35
natured Saturnine woman, and vice versa. This may not be any fault
of the man or woman, but it is the discordant polarities of their astral
constitutions. The same will hold good between natures of the
Earthy triplicity and those born under the Airy triplicity. A true
knowledge of the science of the stars is necessary to determine con-
jugal harmony or discord. Now, the various sections of our subject
are completed, and it only remains for us to apply the logical outcome
of the principles of sex as they affect man, the universe and the im-
mortality of the soul.
As we view the outward forms of man and woman we cannot fail
to observe the perfect harmony between the external appearance and
the internal cause. Their organisms are the concrete image of the
principles concealed within. It would be the extreme height of ab-
surdity for us to believe that a materialized form bears no correspond-
ence to the forces which created it. The form cannot exist without an
internal cause, and the internal cause is powerless to produce any ex-
ternal form apart from the reflected image of itself and its functions.
Under these circumstances it must be self-evident that every male
organism is the absolute outcome of masculine forces, and every female
organism the product of feminine qualities. Therefore, a male soul
cannot be born into the world under the cover of a female form.
Neither can a female soul be ushered upon the planes of humanity im-
prisoned within the masculine body. These are Nature's simple facts,
which ought to be apparent to every thinking mind. But it seems that
such is not the case, for we are seriously informed by certain theosoph-
ical writers that during the various incarnations of the human soul
within the human form, man may incarnate in the form of a woman,
and vice versa. We can only say that such unutterable nonsense is al-
mpst beneath the notice of any sane mind, and those who make such
ridiculous assertions are not only bound to the external plane of ap-
pearances, but are completely ignorant of the true light of Occult
Science.
It often transpires that we find men who appear to possess true
feminine natures, and women who seem to be masculine in tempera-
ment, but this is not really the case. It is only an appearance caused
by the combined influence of pre-natal conditions, and stellar positions
at birth. The Buddhistical conception of man and woman rounding
out until sex becomes obliterated, is probably the most transcendental
36 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
delusion that ever originated within the oriental brain; therefore, we
will take no further notice of such mystical folly.
The human form, as male and female, is the material culmination
of Nature's sexual expression. Upon this plane she can go no further,
for beyond this limit we step within the spaces of the ether where
Nature continues· her wonderful expression of sex in strict harmony
with the laws of correspondence to the planes below. While dealing
with the forms assumed by man, we must briefly notice those vital
secretions which form the physical conditions for re-production of his
kind. The seminal fluids are the most ethereal of all physical secretions,
and contain the very quintessence of human nature. The sexual or-
ganism exists as a factor in procreation, therefore, the organs have their
proper functions and use or they would not be present. To suddenly
and completely suppress their natural functions will do a great deal of
physical and spiritual harm, because the reaction will create violent
discord within the ethereal constitution. In fact, the complete sup-
pression is almost as bad as excessive use or lustful indulgence. It is
only one of the two extremes, nothing more. When the sexual organism
is evolved above the physical plane of its manifestation, the seminal
fluids are absorbed by the magnetic constitution and the etherealized
atoms help to build up the spiritual body of ·man. But when this is
not so these seminal germs, if not passed off amid the other secretions
from the body, live and germinate a swarm of elemental lifeforms
which rob the organism of a portion of its vitality.
To obey the laws of Nature is the only safe and sure road to evolve
the spiritual senses of the soul, and one of these laws is the rightful
union of the sexes. Celibacy in itself is not a natural state; it is purely
artificial, because it ignores one of the principal elements of our being.
Therefore, there is great spiritual danger in a celibate life, and nfne
tenths of the mystical manias and spiritual saturnalia of past history
have originated among celibates. It is well to remember this at the
present day, as there is some considerable danger of history repeating
itself.
Celibacy, as a quick means of artificially stimulating and prod,uc-
ing certain so-called spiritual powers and mediumistic states, is a
successful method, so far as mere psychological results are concerned,
but one that is fraught with terrible danger. It is a method that should
be discouraged in all cases wherein the spiritual constitution of the
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 37
organism is in a negative conditon. Under the most favorable circum-
stances it is a very questionable practice unless the spiritual nature is
sufficiently active to absorb and use the etherealized atoms of the
seminal fluid which has become dematerialized by the magnetic activ-
ities of Occult training.
Any species of "forcing" the attributes of the soul, renders their
manifestations weak and unhealthy, hence liable to error and delusion.
It is upon this basis that we account for the spiritual absurdities of
many oriental mystics. Their severe asceticism renders them the un-
suspecting prey of every imaginable species of Occult delusion. Celi-
bacy, then, must only take place when the animal nature has been
evolved so far upward toward the higher principles, that the sexual
propensities are susceptible of extending their vibrations to a higher
plane of action. In this case, celibacy becomes an absolute necessity
of further Occult progress. Herein, we see once more the paradox of
truth. Upon one plane it becomes a delusion and a snare, but upon a
higher plane it contains all the elements of a glorious truth. Conse-
quently no being, human or divine, can lay down any hard and fast
line to guide the various processes of spiritual development. Each or-
ganism requires a system that is peculiar to itself, each soul a training
specially adapted to the plane it occupies. From this it will be seen
that nothing more than the general principles of Occult training can
be given. From such outlines each must adapt such rules and exercises
as are applicable to him as he learns from self study and practice.
And only those who are themselves spiritually enlightened can see the
true state of the soul and, physician-like, scientifically, prescribe for its
various disorders.
When we regard the mystical ramifications of sex as represented
in the universal creation of suns, stars, moons and planets, we see the
same principles at work throughout every department of their being,
even to their shape and the form of their orbit. The suns are mascu-
line, and represent the cosmic male spirit. The planets are feminine,
and consequently become the fruitful wombs of progressive life. The
moons are neither the one nor the other; they are the conflicting off-
spring of disturbing forces within the sun and its planet. They are the
lowest organic expression of planetary life, and as such represent the
state of the hermaphrodite. So, both in man and in the universe, the
potentialities of sex swing the mighty pendulum of thought and motion.
38 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
The grand object which the divine Ego seeks to realize in the
evolution of the human soul, is the complete differentiation of its
latent attributes. The soul must become the expression of both its
qualities, and must express the true nature of the biune spirit; hence
male and female evolution is the outcome. Each soul rounds out and
completes, so to say, its own section of the Ego, and in doing this it
becomes individualized as a complete expression of one ray of the
divine idea, hence it has a perfect identity with its source. Both male
and female complete the whole, and are related to each other as
Osiris and Isis; brother and sister; their individuality, in the form of
their spiritual identity, is forever preserved, and their united as well as
their separate consciousness becomes an attribute of their glorious
immortality. Without sex there cannot be eternal life, and to absorb
or destroy these principles in the human organism brings about a
divorce between man and his divinity, and thus robs conscious hu-
manity of its deathless immortality.
IV. The Mystery of Isis
The human organism, in its more interior sense, is the mystical
uterus of Isis, (that is, the human organism is the uterus of Nature),
ever pregnant with the Holy Ghost, (the incarnated soul), which, when
the period of gestation is completed, (the cycle of evolution), shall give
birth to the Son of God, whose kingdom is not of this earth, but of
Heaven (this means, the soul which has attained its immortality, is a
Son of God, etc., whose future state of being is the boundless realm of
Spirit.) I and the Father are one, meaning that the human Ego is but
an atom of the Father, is not the same idea as the more interior state
of Adeptship or being at one with God. This at-one-ment is the mys-
tical Atonement of the Christ (Spirit) within the human soul, (you are
at peace with your spiritual conscience.) These ideas if meditated
upon, will reveal unto you the whole mystery of Christ and the im-
maculate conception. The idea of the human organism being the
mystical womb of Nature, was the cause of the Ancient Priests of the
sanctuary elaborating the magnificent funerals, the cremation of the
Hindoo, the Greek and Roman rites, and embalming of the Egyptians.
It was the most important ceremony of Ancient times, because the most
mystically important and the most sublime rite that the soul can pass,
from matter to spirit, or "back to the Father's home."
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 39
From the Phallic symbolism of ancient sex-worship, through the
dual power of love and hatred, lust and brutality, the same law holds
true. Sex is the great primal law of Nature, both visible and invisible,
objective and subjective. The powers of love and hatred in man, are
feminine and masculine. The man or woman who cannot love is an
inhuman monster; there is nothing human about them, except the
outward physical form of humanity, which is but the lamb's clothing
that ill conceals the ravenous wolf within. It is only the truly human
that can truly love, and in loving let their souls transcend all lower
passions. Lust is not love. Lust is the animal or passional appetite,
with nothing human about it, and woe be to those whose love cannot
rise above the plane of lust.
The deliberate use of so-called "CHECKS" against conception, is
a fearful crime, and should never, under any circumstances, be resorted
to. The vital germ-seeds so wasted will not leave you, but, like fam-
ished vampires, they will germinate within the odyllic soul-sphere.
Your cruel act has separated the Divine spark from them; only the
animal portion remains, and they become the spiritual elementaries of
your own creation, who, like parasites will suck your life away.
If you are not perfectly confident and certain that your sexual
passions are pure and respond only to that one whose soul-affinity
you possess, then at once and forever debar the passion completely,
and lead a life of celibacy, for the soul cannot evolve healthy psychic
powers where the tainted mildew of either lust or an impure life is
allowed to remain. If psychic powers are developed in such a state,
they are abnormal and impure, mere spiritual fungi of the soul, more
tender than hothouse plants, because they are forced and reared under
artificial conditions and, consequently, liable to wither and die upon
exposure to the first blighting currents of the Astral light, when disas-
trous results always follow.
Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest these great fundamental
truths. There is no middle course for the Neophyte who aims at the
practical realization of the occult powers of his soul. It is either
heaven and the ultimate glories of eternal progression, or it is hell and
ruination, with the terrible surroundings of the Black Magician and
almost a certainty of final extinction in the elementary spheres of
the soul-worlds.
True it is, that so-called spiritual gifts do not depend upon moral

THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 41
to man. There are seven grades of them corresponding with the seven
planetary states, and, consequently, corresponding with the seven great
divisions of the human race. It is this class of beings that can and do
become incarnated in the human organism. The class of persons who
most frequently are the means of incarnating these beings are those of
large animal propensity and small spirituality. The conditions are
generally sexual intercourse when the male is in a state of intoxication
or both may be so. When thus inflamed with drink, lust and other
vile passions and thoughts, there is no possible chance for anything
human. When conception takes place under these conditions, an in-
human soul is the result. It is from such unions as these that the
inhuman Neros and Nana Sahibs of history originated. Remember,
that social position or artificial education, cannot alter the natural
result. People of this class are numerous, from the highest to the
lowest, and "dope" addicts are under the same laws and penalty.
The second class of individuals who may be the means of such
incarnations are nervous, sensitive people, who are actually obsessed
by elementaries during sexual union, because, by such obsessions, the
elementaries seem to realize and enjoy the excitement of their lustful
passions. In all such cases inhuman incarnation is the result. Should
conception take place under these conditions, the only remedy these
people have is to abstain completely, or prevent, by the moral purity
of their lives, the possibility of elementary obsession. And lastly, a
woman may, during the period of gestation, magnetically attach an
evil being to her otherwise human child, who will obsess it completely
during life, and doubtless lead it to the scaffold or asylum. This
magnetic attachment is caused by some sudden, extreme exercise of
her passions.
Enough has now been said to enable the thoughtful student to see
the great mystery of sex, completely. He now knows the use and abuse
of sex; understands how to become the parent of good, noble, intel-
lectual human souls for his family and how to avoid causing the pro-
duction of monsters.
Continuing the same laws, we now leave the physical and enter
the spiritual or magnetic states of being and find sex still remains the
supreme law. That same principle which manifests itself as parental
instinct and ferocious passion in the animal; and as affection and lust,
jealousy and hatred in the human; blooms out into its own pure state
42 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
in the Angelic or celestial condition, as Love and Wisdom, in this
most interior state. Its attributes in all exterior states of angelic or
spiritual existence are intuition and reason, the feminine and mascu-
line qualities of each human soul.
Magnetism is of two kinds, viz.; animal and Inineral, and each
kind is dual, or male and female, positive and negative. It is the
Astral fluid containing the properties of the body with which it is
connected; hence, sex always predominates the very soul-force of
Nature, because it is through the agency of this Astral fluid that all the
various phenomena are produced, it is the actual cause of every effect
in both the material and spiritual planes of existence. This force is the
indispensable agent of every Adept, Magician or Mesmerizer, and the
cause of all magnetic and occult phenomena. It pervades every atom
of the vast universe and all of life including planets and stars are
subject to this double law of sex, action and repose. Just as night rests
humanity from the day's activity, does this force restore the equilibrium
of the spiritual and cosmic planes of Nature.
The magnetic and Astral fluid is androgyne or bi-sexual, (exactly
like the human soul) because equilibrium is but the resultant of two
forces eternally re-acting upon each other, this is life. When these
two forces expand and remain so long inactive as to equal each other
and come to complete rest, the condition is death. The same soul-
force, in the hands of the expert magician, has control over life and
death, for, if the magician wills a thing and his will is sufficiently strong,
that thing is done, this is the positive action. Mediumship is the re-
verse, the negative or passive, it is the feminine which receives.
Now we come to the last mystery of the Grade of Eros. It is the
climax of the potential powers of sex, and embraces all the previous
teachings in the recognition of the human organism, as the grand
mystical uterus of Nature. It is the sacred Yoni of the glorious Isis, the
Universal Mother. It is this mystery that explains the immaculate con-
ception of the Christ child, or Divine human within us. It is the im-
mortal soul begotten of the Father, enclosed or incarnated in the flesh,
(the human organism.)
The Virgin Womb, which shall give birth to the immortal Son of
God, when the period of gestation (human incarnation in or on this
material plane) is completed. This period of gestation is, of course,
the great cycle of necessity; for, "except ye be born again ye cannot
THE MYSTERIES OF SEX 43
enter the Kingdom of Heaven." Certainly not. The human soul, while
incarnated in the physical organism, is within the womb of Nature and
it is only when its full time has elapsed, and it has gained its immortal-
ity, that it is re-born into the realm of spirit. It has burst the bonds of
flesh and blood; escaped from its mother's womb, the uterus of Nature,
and is free again.
And now, dear reader, that we have finished our chapter on sex;
can you spare the time to close the book and calmly, quietly and
seriously contemplate on what sex really means?
Let your soul rise as high as possible, in pure, holy thoughts;
thinking only of that mysterious something in life which is able to
develop beautiful, fragrant flowers; delicious, luscious fruit and nour-
ishing grain foods; all from tiny seeds placed in the ground.
How this is accomplished is far beyond our understanding. Yet,
men and women are high above the products of the soil, the birds, the
fish and the animal kingdom. We have freedom of thought and action,
and should keep out of the mire. If we honestly desire the good, noble
things of life, we can live as we think and thus help to make a glorious
heaven here on earth; a real, sincere, friendly brotherhood of men
and women; free of greedy, selfish and immoral strife and ill will
toward each other. Why not try for it?
Truly, this is the eternal prayer of all upright men and women,
to have peace and harmony here on earth.
THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL-SECTION II
THE TRANSITION OF LIFE
CHAPTER I
INCARNATION AND RE-INCARNATION
Probably no truth has been more completely inverted by the ig-
norant and concealed by the learned than that of re-incarnation. In
every age it has been thought necessary by the priesthood to over-awe
the uneducated masses by some species of pious jugglery, and the pop-
ular theory of re-incarnation, as understood and taught at the present
day, is a typical example of truth thus perverted.
By re-incarnation we mean, as now currently understood, the doc-
trine of the re-birth of the human soul in various human forms and
personalities, in different ages, upon the same planet.
NoTE: The reader must bear in mind that the doctrine of human re-incarnation
is not, strictly speaking, a doctrine of Occultism. It is a theological doctrine of
oriental sacerdotalism, formulated by the priesthood either to conceal the real
truth, or to account for what they themselves could not comprehend or explain.
This same thought is expressed by Ranga Hilyod, a very ancient sage of India, in
his book, Illuminated Brahminism, The True Theosophy.
In every bundle of theological chaff there is, undoubtedly, con-
cealed a grain of genuine truth. This is particularly the case with this
doctrine. Up to a given point its teachings are those of truth itself,
but beyond this point the doctrine of re-birth into physical conditions
becomes one of the greatest delusions with which the mystical student
has to deal. To those who are purely upon the plain of appearances it
possesses an almost irresistible attraction because it appears to ac-
count, in a most rational and philosophical manner, for the wide dif-
ference manifested in the mental, social and moral conditions of hu-
manity. Upon the external plane it seems to settle the question of
good and evil, and harmonizes all our inequalities with what seems
divine justice. All these delusive appearances, however, are but empty
shadows of the phenomenal world. They can only deceive those who
are entirely upon the external plane and who have accepted such
teachings without verifying the doctrines for themselves. There are
two methods of verification; one, the actual experiences of the soul, the
other, the response of the soul to the thoughts and ideas we derive
from an author's work. Unfortunately, this latter kind of verification
INCARNATION AND RE-INCARNATION 45
is subject to very serious drawbacks. A mediumistic nature may re-
spond to error because of the more potent thought of the writer, or,
if over-sensitive may be superficial enough to respond to an erroneous
idea through pure sentiment. These means have been seized by the
Inversive Brethren to enable them to fasten upon the sensitive minds,
and mediumistic natures of the western race, these erroneous, delusive
doctrines of karma and re-incarnation. The most finely spun ideals of
"the higher life," of "Devachan," of "The Masters," and of "blissful
Nirvana," have been and are being presented by a host of sentimental,
spiritually sick, mystical writers to explain "the glorious mysteries" of
Nature and "the secret doctrine" of all religious philosophies, of which
they themselves, in real truth, know very little, apart from the
mediumistic ideas which are projected toward them by the Inversive
Magi. The whole craze is merely a metaphysical delusion cast over
their mentalities by means of a magnetic glamor to deceive them and
their readers.
The reader must not suppose that because a person studies the
various branches of Occult science, tries to lead an ideal life, and,
after acquiring a very large stock of booklore-occultism, begins to
write and publish works upon mystical subjects, that the person is
beyond the worldly plane. On the contrary, this class are the most
external of all, because they become dominated by the thought forms
of certain Occult leaders upon the physical plane, and their sensitive
natures become absolutely blind to the real spiritual truth. We have
seen numerous examples of this among the popular writers upon
Modern Theosophy. The soul alone is capable of penetrating the
realm of shadows, and seeing through the inverted images to learn
the real truth.
It seems very strange that the external followers of "the path"
which leads to physical re-incarnation, can be so blind as to imagine
that this earth is the only place within God's infinite universe whereon
divine justice can be satisfied, and due punishment meted out to the
evil doer. The life beyond is far more real, far more earnest, and a
much more conscious life than here on earth. Surely, then, the soul
can work out its redemption there better than here. Surely, the soul
ought to be granted the privilege of knowing for what wrong it is
being made to suffer, but this is not the case according to the fallacies
of esoteric Buddhism. But alas; the spiritually blind are blind indeed.
46 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
They that have eyes to see let them see. For modern Buddhistic
Theosophy cannot perceive in the slightest degree, beyond the dull
veil of external matter.
As a typical example of such material conceptions, we will quote
from a publication professing to give the secret doctrines of all relig-
ions, The Mystery of the Ages, by Marie, Countess of Caithness. In
a footnote upon the subject of Karma, page 143, the writer says;
"Karma is the law of consequences, by which every act receives its
exact recompense in the next life when the soul is born again. But
unless the same soul passes on through a succession of earth lives such
a recompense is impossible, and neither could it expiate or make
amends for the injuries it may have done to others unless again brought
into contact with them."
So thoroughly materialistic are the ideas conveyed in the above
extract that one would think that esoteric Buddhism was nothing but
materialism run to seed. According to such erroneous theories we are
to believe that recompense for evil doing is impossible except by physi-
cal re-birth. Such writers are so destitute of the higher spiritual per-
ception that they cannot comprehend any process of repentance and
purification except upon the material earth, while incased within a
material organism. We can only say to the followers of such, that when
authors set themselves upon such a pinnacle of knowledge as to de-
clare what is not possible within the mighty spaces of spiritual exist-
ence, they ought to be in a position to verify their assertions. If they
cannot do this, then they are simply boasting pretenders to a state of
knowledge and spiritual development which they do not possess, and
seeing that their teachings do not in any sense agree with the actual
experiences of those who have penetrated the realm of spirit, and in-
vestigated the mysteries of life for themselves, we challenge their right
to speak with such authority. How different from such ideas are the
real truths of Nature. How different are spiritual realities from such
oriental theories and dreamy speculations. The talented author of
"Art Magic" and "Ghost Land", who for years had investigated the
various unseen realms of life for himself, gives the world the brief
results of his life-long research in the latter work. Speaking upon re-
incarnation this author says; "To my dim apprehension, and in view
of my long years of wandering through spirit spheres, where teaching
INCARNATION AND RE-INCARNATION 47
spirits and blessed angels guided my soul's ardent explorations, this
brief summary of our pre-existent states explains all that the re-incar-
nationists have labored so sedulously to theorize upon. The universal
and reiterated assertions of myriads of spirits in every stage of a pro-
gressive beyond, convinced me there was NO return to mortal birth,
NO retrogression in the scale of cosmic being, as a return to material
incarnations undoubtedly would be, and all the demands of progress,
justice, and advancement, are supplied by the opportunities offered
the soul in the sphere of spiritual existence."
NoTE: At the time these books were written ( 1875-76) modem theosophists knew
nothing of the Buddhistical theories they have since adopted. Our author refers
to the re-incarnation theory of the Spiritualists of France. Not until the Theo-
sophical Society removed its headquarters to India did it go crazy after India's
subtle delusions.
The same author concludes the chapter of his experiences in the
following eloquent words; "I have stood on the threshold of glorious
lands, where my eyes could perceive the radiance of celestial spheres,
the memory of whose brightness will warn and beckon me upwards
forever."
The personal experiences thus narrated correspond exactly in their
results with those of the present writer, and also with many other true
spiritually initiated Occultists with whom we are associated. Can the
carefully tabulated results of all our united labors count for nought?
Is it possible that the unanimous but legitimate conclusions of scores of
spiritual investigators, each and all of whom were specially qualified
for research by reason of their own soul development, are false and
delusive? Must the result of our own personal research and actual
experiences of the soul within the realm of spirit be cast away as un-
reliable, simply, because they conflict with an old fossilized theory of
some priestly metaphysicians? Not so, dear reader; not so. "Prove
all things," saith the apostle, "hold fast that which is good;" and such
is our humble intention, and our advice to all students searching for
truth.
We repeat what we have so often said to those who have studied
under our care, that re-incarnation, as taught by modem writers, is
nothing but a theory of the physical intellect. In other words, it is
the metaphysical outcome of intellectual force destitute of spiritual in-
tuition or truth. It is an attempt of external mind to harmonize good
48 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
and evil and nothing more. It contains nothing approaching to the
pure intuitions of the spirit in its composition. It was formulated to
deceive, by cunning priestly minds, in the first instance, and after-
wards accepted as a divine truth by those who possess nothing but their
intellects to guide them in their gropings for truth. Knowing as we do
the Why and Wherefore of its present di.Husion of error, we challenge
all esoteric Buddhists to produce one single individual, a responsible
medium who has penetrated the realms of spirit for himself, who can
truthfully say that the theory agrees with the actual results of his
own personal investigations. From the beginning to the end, this re-
incarnation and Karma doctrine of Buddhism is a purely external
theory which tries to explain the apparent contradictions of physical
Nature; hence it is destitute of spiritual proof, or of the possibility of
spiritual proof, and it is palmed off upon the mental currents of west-
ern thought as emanating from supposed holy (?) mahatmas. But
we deny in toto that such a theory is taught or ever has been taught,
as a true theory, by any real adept. The magical hierophants of the In-
versive Magi, are beings we consider not worthy of the name of Adept,
because they are the legionaries of the Dark Satellite, and as such
are only adepts so far as the mysteries of practical magic are con-
cerned. They cannot penetrate beyond the astral zones of the cosmic
and magnetic elementals, hence they know absolutely nothing of the
higher states of the soul world, or of the mysteries of angelic life. They
deny their very existence, and substitute a delusive Devachan, and
dreamy Nirvana of nothingness in their place.
Before going any further we would impress upon our student the
fact that there is not a single doctrine within the whole range of Oc-
cult science that is not susceptible in its interpretation to the well
known Latin proverb, "cum grano salis." Further, that every truth is
a paradox when viewed from different planes; this latter fact is es-
pecially true regarding re-incarnation.
We now commence at the point where we left off in our previou~
chapter, in the descent of life into external conditions. From this point
we see it enter and successively pass through the mineral, vegetable
and animal life waves of the planet. In obedience to the higher and
more interior laws of its own especial round, the divine attributes are
ever seeking to unfold their involved potentialities. No sooner is one
form dispensed with, or its capabilities exhausted, than a new and
INCARNATION AND RE-INCARNATION 49
still higher form is brought into requisition, each in its turn becoming
more complex in its structure and diversified in its functions. Thus,
we see the atom of life commencing in the mineral of the external
world, working upward and outward. The grand spiral of its evolu-
tionary life is carried forward slowly, imperceptibly, but always pro-
gressively, through the higher states. There is no form too simple, no ~
organism too complex, for the inconceivably marvellous adaptability
of the human soul in its divine struggles of progressive life.
Throughout the entire cycle of necessity, the character of its
genius, the degree of its spiritual emanation, and the state of life to
which it originally belonged, are preserved with mathematical exacti-
tude. These states correspond, in a general sense, to the four ancient
elements, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. Yet, as a matter of purification
alone, each atom must pass through and be a part of all these states
upon its upward journey. Not only so, but before the human monad
can possibly attain the climax of its material evolution, which is the
grand terminus of its earthly incarnations, it must also have passed
through certain phases of its existence upon each planet to which
its microcosmic nature in the embodied man shall bear a mathematical
correspondence. Thus, between the mineral and man there is a per-
fect scale of life; no one form being parallel with another in the grand
chain of cosmic being. Even the insects count, in the links, as progres-
sive states. In the whole of this chain are seven worlds through which
the soul monad migrates, and from whatever point or planet it com-
mences its toilsome cosmic journey, the seventh planet is the end of
its material orbit, and the sphere wherein it attains the human form
divine. Here it becomes conscious of life, able to learn and under-
stand. In no case does the soul monad commence as a mineral and
attain unto the animal or human plane upon the same planet. It rests
or becomes latent on each alternate planet. For instance, the mineral
atoms upon this earth will undergo a purely impersonal cycle upon
Venus, which is their next sphere, and then become incarnated within
the vegetable plane upon the next planet, and so on; while the min-
eral atoms of the planet Mars, when they reach the Earth will be
purely impersonal beings and will not incarnate here as objective forms
but will pass their cycle in the astral spaces, then enter into material
conditions again upon Venus. Thus, the soul monad has four objective
states, and three subjective states. The objective states are as; 1-3-5-7,
50 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
viz.; the mineral, vegetable, animal and man. The subjective states are
as; 2-4-6, negative states of its embryonic being. The awakening to
conscious life with ability to think and understand is carried out by
the soul after it attains the objective human form or seventh (7) state.
The next state is beyond matter. "Once and only once," saith the law.
Mter the human state, Nature shuts the door behind her. Eternal pro-
gression is the anthem of all creative life.
NoTE: We have omitted to note the exceptions to the general laws of re-incarnation
which have been set forth. There are three classes of exceptions in which re-birth
within the human organism may be the usual course.
Class I. Cases of abortion, or of still-born children. These, not having at-
tained consciousness of external human life, may, and in fact generally do, be-
come re-incarnated.
Class II. Cases of natural born idiots. Though it is very rare that even
idiots are so lost to all external consciousness as to make re-birth necessary to them.
Class III. Cases of special "Messianic" incarnation by exalted souls, for the
special purpose of enlightening the race. The laws which govern this mystery
are unknown to all except the highest adepts. Such an incarnation transpires about
every 600 years, and never twice in succession to the same race. In all cases of
Messiahship these glorious souls are conscious of their mission from the moment
of birth, though doubtless they wisely keep such precious knowledge to them-
selves as a protection against the tender mercies of the dominant priesthood of
their generation. This class may be called cases of conscious re-incarnation. The
same spirit is never so incarnated more than once. Hence the stories of Buddha's
numerous incarnations are pure fiction.
When we apply these laws to external life we can gauge the soul's
past history with an accuracy which is truly marvelous. Thus, for
instance, the truly Martial individual belongs to that state of life known
in Occult phraseology as Fiery, and consequently those· peculiar and
especial attributes were "rounded out" upon the planet known as Mars.
That is to say, the fiery characteristics of an atom belonging to that
state of life corresponding to the Fiery triplicity, were evolved through
various organic forms during its cycle of incarnation upon the planet
of Mars. On the other hand, a Saturnine individual, during its sojourn
upon the Martial planet was but little attracted to the Maritial forms
of existence. In fact, the soul monad, at that particular stage of its
journey, passed through a kind of impersonal coma instead_of an active
evolutionary life. This was because there was but little affinity between
itself and the planet. Consequently, the planet had not sufficient at-
tractive power to project the impersonal soul into the more outward
forms of organic being. The same may be said of each planetary char-
INCARNATION AND RE-INCARNATION 51
acteristic. Their latent or active expression in the embodied individual
reveals to the initiated mind the whole of the soul's past history during
the various stages of its impersonal planetary life. A careful study of
this fact will do much to explain the deeper mysteries of Astrology.
The planets at a person's birth do not make him what he is; they only
harmonize with his conditions.
During the process of the soul's involution, the monad is not
actually incarnated in any form whatever. The soul descends into
earthly conditions down the subjective arc of the spiral, and re-ascends
upon the objective arc. Rebirth commences, as before stated, when
the objective mineral state is reached. The process of the monad's
descent through the various realms, is accomplished by a gradual
polarization of its Deific powers, caused by its contact with the grad-
ually externalizing conditions of the downward arc of the cycle. At
each step the soul becomes more and more involved within the mater-
ial. "The sphere of re-incarnation," embracing the birth in an external
form, its transient life there, then death, and then, the same soul's
re-birth in a higher and more perfect form of life, is really comprised
between the Mineral plane and Man. Between these two planes, the
soul must pass through countless forms and phases. It is an absolute
truth that, as an impersonal being, "man lives upon many earths before
he reaches this one. Myriads of worlds swarm in space where the soul
in rudimental states performs its pilgrimages until its cyclic progress
enables it to reach the magnificently organized planet, whose glorious
function it is to confer upon the soul, self-consciousness." At this point
alone does the soul become man. In every other step, of its wild,
cosmic journey, it is but an embryonic being, a fleeting, temporary
shape of matter, an impersonal creature in which a part, but only a
part, of the imprisoned soul shines forth; a rudimental form with
rudimental functions, ever living, dying, then sustaining a brief spir-
itual existence only to be re-born again, and thus, to sustain the suc-
cessive round of births and deaths. New organs and new functions
are acquired with each birth, to be utilized by the gradually expanding
soul as a means of further development. We see it in the fire of the
flint and as atomic energy, and as we watch the revolving sparks of
the mineral soul, we can see it burst forth to the sun light in the garb
of the lowly lichen. It guards the snow white purity of the lotus, and
animates the aromatic glory of the rose. It is the butterfly springing
52 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
from the chrysalid shell, and the nightingale singing in the grove.
"From stage to stage it evolves; new births and new deaths; anon to
die, but sure to live again; ever striving and revolving upon the whirl-
ing, toilsome, dreadful; rugged path until it awakes for the last time
upon earth; awakes once more a material shape, a thing of dust, a
creature of flesh and blood, but now a man." The grand, self con-
scious state of humanity, is attained, and the climax of earthly incar-
nation is reached. Never again, will the soul enter the material matrix
or suHer the pains of material re-incarnation. Henceforth its re-births
will be in the realm of spirit.
Those who hold the strangely illogical doctrine of a multiplicity
of human births, have certainly never evolved the lucid state of soul
consciousness within themselves. Had they done so, the theory of
re-incarnation as held by a vast number of talented men and women,
well versed in worldly wisdom, would not have received the slightest
recognition at the present day. We would strongly impress the fact,
that, an external education is comparatively worthless as a means of
obtaining a true knowledge of Nature. Remember, that though the
acorn becomes the oak, and the cocoanut the palm; the oak, though
giving birth to myriad others, never again becomes an acorn, nor the
palm the juicy nut. So it is with man. When once the soul becomes
incarnated in the human organism, and thus attains the consciousness
of external life, man becomes a self responsible being, accountable for
all his actions. This 1\CCountability constitutes his earth karma, (which
is explained in chapter III) and the reward or punishment, as the case
may be, is consciously and divinely administered in the state which
each individual soul has prepared for itself. The soul is not ignorantly
ushered again into the world, completely unconscious of its past load
of karma. Such a means of redemption, instead of being divine, would
be void of justice. It would be diabolical. When human laws punish
the criminal, he is conscious of the misdeed for which he is suffering.
If this were not so the punishment would be horribly unjust. For this
reason we do not punish irresponsible children, nor insane people.
It is thoroughly useless, however, to deal any further with such a
transcendent delusion. We will, therefore, only say that all the so-
called re-awakenings of latent memories, by which certain people
profess to remember certain past lives can be explained, and in fact
are only really explained, by the simple laws of affinity and form.

TH£ 'HitUMI~'I'IC C0X$Tl1'trl'l0N OF MAN
The reader, by this tim>, should be somewhat familiar with the
origin, nature and activities of the divine Ego which gives birth to the
spirit monad of man. All things originate as the objective outcome of
the divine and subjective idcn. The human Ego is tho offspring of that
~-elestinl harmony, a differentiated atom of diffusive formless spirit.
It ""' brought into being through the angelic acti,·ities of p.1rental
souls who arc representative of Love and Wisdom. intelligence and
truth, wit]lin the sun sphere of creative life. \.Ye have ende..1.vorcd to
make these points as clear as possible, bec.~use of their primary im-
portance in realizing, that, the point in the arc, which is clalmed
by the Buddhist cult and their followers as the origin of the soul's
formation, is not so, but is, in fact, only the great turning point, the
bottom rung of Jacob's esoteric ladder, upon which the soul makes
its ascent and descent.
The Theosophists of the human re-incarnation school, while ad-
mitting the absolute divinity of the Ego, fail to account for the genesis
of the soul which the Ego evolves, otherwise, than in matter. So far
as we have been able to lea'Tl, not one of them has any <'Onccption
as to how, when or where, the differentiation of the Ego takes ploce.
Although, they hold, that, th:re is a spiritual evolution preceding all
material e"olution, they cons'der that the first spiritual manifestation
of the soul is un arcane nl)'Siery, known onlv by the highest adepts.
These adepts of the Buddhist Cultus, however, totally ignore the state
of angclhood. they deny its OJ<i>tcnce. because they, in their concen-
tratod sphere of absolute sclfhood, can form no conception of such
a state. The charge of spiritulll selfishness has often been made. even
by theosoprusts, against the :<-achings of their mahatmas, and there
is good foundation for the cl.arge when their teachings are critically
examined. Such a state is "' much above and beyond the grasp of
their minds as the doctrine of Nirvana is beyond the grast> of the
African bushman. They arc particularly fond of applying to outsiders
that proverb which intimates that there arc more laws in heaven and
earth than are dreamed of in man's phiiO<Ophy, but they fail to apply
1'H£ HPRM£T'JC 00!\'STtn.n 10~ OF MAX 55
thjs truism to their own august selves.
Jn our chapter upon re-incarnation, we brielly pointed out the
actual sphere of re-birth within objective forms, and in doing so, mnny
important features we•·e omitted which appear to belong to that sub-
ject, but which in re.~lity belong to the present one.
Re-birth within progressive forms is not for the sole purpose of
..,;voJving and energizing the latent powers of th~ human soul. as so
many ignorantJy imagine. If tltis wel'e tl'uc, and man alone was the
sole object of dC\·elopmcnt, it would constitute the basis of absolute
selfishness. We can safely assert that such human e.•clusiveness is
only an appearance as there is wthing approaching to selfishness in the
creative design. When we t>en•tmtc below this plane of appearances,
we 6ml countless realms of beings, equally as immortal as man, going
tlu·ough tl>eir cyclic rounds, oi>cying the same universal lnw as our-
selves. These realms constitute stepping stones for tl:rternal humanity
in its journey towards the infinite. The organisms of humanity, in
their turn, form the evolutionary spheres or material means by which
these same realms pass throug·~ their cycles of progressive life. If we
malce usc of ecrtain plan('S for our soul's advancement, it only follows
as a matter of reactionary law (justice) that we should render an
equivalent sc.Tvicc in return, hence-. the importance of a true know-
ledge of our hidden or Hermetic constitution.
Man, as we behold him by means of our physical senses, appears
to us a wonderful specimen of mechanical skill and architectural
beauty. Each organic part is so exquisitely formed, and in such per-
fect unison one with another, and each with the whole. There is little
wonder that the human organism has been taken as tl>e Gnite type
of the unknown in6nitc. If tins be true upon the external plane, it is
infinitely more so upon the internal plane. Hc•·e, bone, Oe.~h. blood,
and hair, the externals of the outward body, are seen to be nothing
but the crystaUizatJons of ethe;-eal force, hciU togctJ>c:r by mental bcing.
t\ot held together as a matter of necessity, for the sake of it~ own es-
t>c'Cial evolution, but simply as the natural outcome, the physical re-
action of its ethereal activities. In order to present a clear and definite
pichtre of what man rc-.tlly is, we wiJl formulate his Hermetic consti-
tution, ns follows;
A. A physieal form fourfold in its composition, consisting in a
general sense, of bones, blood, flesh, and hair. This form, as a whole,
56 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
is composed of an infinite number of separate organic cells, each cell
constituting a minute system of its own, which in its turn has been
formed by the crystallization of imponderable forces around a living
spirit entity.
B. An electro-vital body, seemingly composed of pale phosphor-
escent light, enclosing a glittering skeleton framework of electric fire.
This is the purely electro-magnetic form, inseparable from the physical
body during life, because this latter depends for its continued existence
upon the active presence of the physical form. The pale phosphores-
cent light presents a very perfect outline portrait of the physical body,
while the fiery skeleton shows the interior electro-nervous system of
the organism. The branches of the nerve system, spreading out in
every direction from the great trunk lines of the brain and spinal
column, present to the trained spiritual sight the appearance of an
infinitude of fine pencil rays of light darting in straight lines with in-
conceivable rapidity toward every point of the compass.
C. An astral form, so called because it is composed of the mag-
netic light evolved by the planet. This astral light differs in quality
and degree upon every orb in the universe. It is generated from the
universal ether of space, and it may be said to be the ether under a
change of form and capacity. It is the soul of the material planet,
consequently, the cause world of that planet's external phenomena.
To give a better and truer idea of this almost unknown astral light
we will illustrate. We say that water is the universal material fluid.
This is a truth, but some water is salty, some brackish, some bitter,
others sulphuric, sweet or fresh. This is exactly the case with the
astral fluid. It differs upon every star. It is this difference that con-
stitutes the strikingly different qualities of planetary influence. With
this slight digression we resume. This astral form presents a perfect
image of the external personality, even to style and condition of the
clothing worn at the time. This form is easily separable from the physi-
cal organism, and constitutes the true or real personality. By person-
ality we do not mean the individuality or identity of the person, but
we mean the persona, or appearance assumed by the soul during its
sojourn within the material vortices, or planes of cosmic force. This
form is under the direct control of the mental being animating it, and,
under suitable conditions, can be made to assume (temporarily) any
ideal image or form within the grasp of the dominating mind. When
THE HERMETIC CONSTITUTION OF MAN 57
the astral double is absent from the physical body, the latter, if awake,
performs whatever it may be engaged in doing; in a purely automatic
or mechanical manner. At the same time it is susceptible to any pain
or injury which may befall the absent double. The astral is also
specially susceptible to magical operations. Probably nine tenths of
all black magical injury are operated by means of or upon this ethereal
form.
D. The animal soul is that section of the animating entity in-
carnated within the microcosm, which constitutes the lower arc of
its universe. This animal soul is formless as regards its separate ex-
pression, and can be traced only in the lower lines and shadings of the
human countenance. It is the seat of the selfish, brutal desires, which
are, in themselves, lower than the human sphere but are evolving up-
ward through it from the animal. Their activities are strictly confined
to the astral and material planes.
E. The spiritual body, per se, is a finely etherealized organism
which in the majority of the present generation is either latent or em-
bryonic. This body constitutes the human form divine in the higher
sphere of the soul world where man becomes the angel. It is the white
robe and golden crown given the elect in the Apocalypse of St. John.
In other words, it is the soul's expression of the heavenly raiment of
the purified man.
F. The divine soul is that section· of. the entity incarnated within
the microcosm which constitutes the higher arc of its universe. This
soul, like the lower one, is formless as to its separate expression, and
can be traced only in the higher lines of the human countenance. It
is the seat of the good, unselfish, noble aspirations, and of all those
actions which spring forth spontaneously to aid the weak, the suffering
and afflicted, unassociated with any interested motives of self.
G. The pure spirit entity itself, called the divine Ego. This is the
divine atom of life, the vital spark, the central controlling spiritual
sun of the microcosm. It is never incarnated within the form until the
seventh state or perfect manhood is attained.
The above are the exact divisions of the human constitution, as
viewed from without and within. Upon the surface this division will
not appear to differ very materially from the septenary formula of
the Buddhist cult. But, in reality, there is all the difference which
exists between Cause and Effect. The chief point of difference will
58 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
be found in the fifth principle as they term it, and which is called also
the human soul, manas or mind. Mind, though correct in some respects,
is, to say the least, a very vague and unsatisfactory term to express in-
tellectual capacity or the power of thinking and reasoning, and re-
ducing the objects of thought to a science. For this reason; mind exists
as a motive force all the way from the mineral to man, and, surely
Buddhists will not say that rocks contain (mind) their fifth principle.
It is upon this point in particular where, in the opinion of the student
of Hermetic philosophy, that Esoteric Buddhists make a very serious
mistake. It is the evolution of this "principle," we are told, that gives
us the power of understanding; without this, we should be upon the
plane of the animal and act from mere instinct. When this principle is
active, man becomes noble, humane and capable of understanding,
or, in other words, instead of being a creature of instinct only, he be-
comes a reasonable being. We question the whole of such teachings.
For instance, a man may be the intellectual giant of his age, so far
as mere mental capacity is concerned, and yet at the same time be the
most selfish, unjust and immoral. History teems with such examples;
while, at the same time, some of Nature's noblest souls have been
those whose intellectual abilities have been very much. below the
average of the race. There are intellectual animals among mankind,
human only in form; while on the other hand, there are many de-
mented human beings whose souls are akin to the angels. "This fifth
principle," we are told on page 175 of "The Mystery of the Ages," "is
the highest principle of the animals." But, Hermetic initiates deny
this in toto. They assert that this "principle" is no principle at all, but
merely a form; that in real fact, there are only three principles in an
active state, viz.; animal, human and deific. The remaining four are
merely forms or reactions. It is the action and reaction of these prin-
ciples which produce every class of mental phenomena in existence,
be it vegetable sensitiveness, animal instinct, human reason or deific
perception. They form the three primary colors of the sours spectrum;
while the remaining forms are simply complementary reactions.
The Hermetic constitution of man consists of three active prin-
ciples, all emanations from the one universal principle, and four second-
ary reactions. This constitution will correspond to the trinity of the
ancient Gnostics and the modern spiritualists, as consisting of body,
soul and spirit, in the following manner; Body, (A and B); Soul,
THE HERMETIC CONSTITUTION OF MAN 59
(C and D); Spirit, (E, F and G). It also corresponds to the quater-
nary or fourfold constitution of the Kabbalists and the Greek specu-
lators on Egyptian Theosophy, who taught that there is a body, an
astral or magnetic body, the animal soul, and the divine soul. Body,
(A and B); Astral body, (C); Animal soul, (D); Divine soul, (E, F
and G). And so may we proceed with every system of which we have
any knowledge. The only contradictions are the appearances upon
the surface, chiefly due to an insufficient use, or to a misuse of terms.
In reality, there is no difference in any system, when it is traced to its
primal source. The same may be said of the Buddhist constitution,
when understood in its true spirit. The radical differences are due to
their gross misinterpretation of the one fundamental law; one truth.
one principle, one agent (law) and one word.
We must now briefly sketch the Hermetic constitution, and pre-
sent the four fold teaching of the Western initiates. Man consists of
three duads and the Ego, a total of seven, which stand in the relation
of Refraction and Reflection to each other. They are as follows;
Firstduad
A. Reflection, Physical body.
Secondduad
C. Astral body.
B. Refraction, Electro-magnetic form. D. Animal soul.
G. The true Ego.
'Third duad
E. Spiritual form.
F. Divine soul.
The whole of these three duads are controlled and carried for-
ward in their cyclic orbit by the Divine Ego, the absolute atomic spirit
entity. Thus, the three duads and the Ego constitute the fourfold
microcosm of the Hermetic schools. This is the most perfect system
that can be formulated in words because the duads travel in pairs.
At death we lose A and B. Then, dw-ing our purgatorial process
through the sphere of purification in the soul states of the disembodied
humanity C and D are gradually thrown off. Not separated, as one
would quarter up an orange, but gradually thrown off, atom by atom,
as they are ready to move forward upon their progressive journey.
The unprepared atoms are liberated and sent forward upon their own
special lines, and all gross matter eliminated. The animal principles
are no portion of the purified soul and are dispersed as separate cells
within the cause world, and ultimately nothing is left but the trinity,
E, F and G, the Spiritual form, the Divine soul, and the true Ego; or
rather the duad E and F, because the true Ego G does not become a
60 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
part of the duad until it has ascended beyond these soul spheres. At
this point, man is the positive or male spirit of the Ego; woman, the
negative or feminine. The true angel requires the spiritual union of
both principles.
Man, as he appears to the outward sight, is, as we have shown,
very different from the being within. He contains a universe of life
within his organism; countless myriads of spirit atoms are evolving
through him and are as independent of him, in reality, as man is of
the planet which gave him birth. The truly human being is the most
interior or spiritual soul. The whole of the lower nature and the ex-
ternal organism are only the various realms of being which the human
monad has conquered and subjected to its imperial rule during its
cyclic journey. We should say, to be true, that the externals are the
reflections of those elemental states moulded more or less rudely by
the human soul after its own divine form. The millions of separate
entities within the human sphere are no more the real man than the
forty mjllion inhabitants of France were Napoleon who ruled them
with his imperial will.
A few words now regarding the WILL and the REASON, and we
must· close. WILL is universal, and it is as impossible to point out
where it begins or where it ends as it is to separate the colors of the
rainbow. The power of the WILL upon the external plane depends
upon the strength of the electro-vital constitution B. While upon the
spiritual plane WILL depends upon the activity of the spiritual con-
stitution E. Within the astral plane the potent WILL must have both
of these (B and E) well developed to be successful. If B alone is
potent, only the elemental realms can be contacted. If only E is active,
then the higher or spiritual world will be contacted, not the astral.
Under these circmristances nothing but mediumship can. be attained.
The true form of training, then, is to evolve that which is the most
latent, so as to bring about the equilibrium. In the_ great majority of
cases, of course, it is the spiritual that requires evolving. Considering
the WILL as a universal power, it naturally follows that the strength
of our WILL must depend entirely upon the capacity we possess for
absorbing and reprojecting this power. In fact, Man's WILL is only
limited by his capacity to absorb the one Universal Will. This WILL is
not, it itself, a principle; it is only an active result, viz.; transcendental
THE HERMETIC CONSTITUTION OF MAN 61
matter in rapid motion. Everything utilizes some portion of this WILL
in its own peculiar way.
The reason, manas, or mind, is simply mental capacity, and like
the WILL, is not a principle but a result. Intellect is the offspring of
innumerable and constantly changing causes or combinations of force
never repeated under exactly the same conditions, consequently, no
two people are exactly alike. The seat or mainspring of reason, intellect,
understanding, and mind, is consciousness; and whether it will be good
or evil, will depend upon the respective activities of the animal and
divine souls. The higher the soul evolves, the more spiritual the un-
derstanding becomes, until perfect rapport with the divine spirit is
attained. This is the true at-one-ment. Man made perfect.
From the foregoing the student must perceive that a man may be
a perfect intellectual genius upon the physical plane, and at the same
time be a veritable idiot in a spiritual sense. Very many intellectuals
are standing before the world today and being accepted as the grand
repositories of absolute knowledge because most of mankind are
wholly engrossed in worldly affairs and are spiritually asleep.
CHAPTER III
KARMA
"If we are ever to know anything clearly,
we must be released from the body,
that the soul by itself may see things by
themselves as they really are." Socrates.
We need scarcely say that we fully agree with the above remarks
of Plato's teacher. While in the body we are completely fenced in by
delusive appearances, and had the Greek sage been alive today those
prominent individuals who so loudly and glibly speak and write upon
the subject of Karma would have been very greatly inconvenienced
by the Athenian's terrible logic.
"Karma is the law of consequences,-of merit and demerit", say the
Buddhists. "It is that force which moulds our physical destiny in this
world, and regulates our period of misery or happiness in the world
to come." We are also further informed that "Karma is the cold, in-
flexible justice which metes out to each individual the exact same
measure of good and evil at his next physical re-birth that he measured
to his fellow-men in this." Not only so, but this karma at death re-
mains somewhere or other down upon the astral planes of the planet,
like an avenging demon, waiting anxiously for the period of Deva-
chanic happiness to come to an end, in order to re-project the poor
unfortunate soul once more into the magnetic vortices of material in-
carnation, where, with its load of bad karma hanging like a millstone
round its neck, it will in all human probability generate a still greater
load of this theological dogma, and consequently, at each re-birth it
will sink deeper, unless the spiritual Ego can bring it to some con-
sciousness of its fearfully sinful state. How this may transpire is not
very satisfactorily explained. If the human soul only receives punish-
ment for the sins and wrongs it inflicted upon others during a pre-
vious life, then, surely, the soul when it first became incarnated must
have started on its human journey without any karma to suffer for.
One is naturally led to ask, then, how it first began to commit sin? For
we are distinctly told that what we now suffer at the hands of others
is only a just repayment for our own past sins. If, then, we had no
past sins, we should be perfectly free from trouble. We are distinctly
KARMA 63
taught that the first or pre-adamite men, i.e., those of the golden age,
were perfect. How, then, did this abominable karma get a start in
the world? This question it is our duty to fully explain in the present
chapter.
We have given a general idea of the Karma of Theosophical Budd-
hism, and before revealing the origin of this Oriental delusion we will
present the Hermetic doctrine of Karma.
I. Karma is not an active principle, but, on the contrary, it is
crystallized force. It is the picture gallery or cosmic play of Nature.
II. Karma constitutes the scenery, essence and mental imagery
of a person's past existence. It is a picture of their acts while on earth
that become living realities to them in the soul world.
III. The karmic sphere of an individual's existence, exists as the
astral life currents along which the soul has traveled and which be-
come crystallized forms, expressive of the actions and the motives
which prompted them. Therefore, our past karma constih1tes the soul's
past history in the astral light, and can· be deciphered by the properly
trained lucid, and even by some mediumistic clairvoyants.
IV. Karma is the offspring of everything; everything possesses
pictorial records of its past evolutions; stones, plants, animals and men.
It is by means of this karma that the Psychometric sensitive can read
the unwritten past of small karmas. 'Without karma, the powers of
Psychometry would be useless. On a grander scale exists the karma
of moons, planets, suns and systems. Races of men, species of animals
and classes of plants, also evolve special racial karmas which constitute
their astral world.
V. The harmonies and discords of cosmic evolution generate their
special karma just the same as thoughts and emotions produce cor-
responding reactions.
VI. Karma is absolutely confined to the reahns of the astral light,
and consequently, is always subjective. Therefore, Karma can exist
only as long as the soul, which generates it, is attached to the same
planet. When a soul leaves the planet its karma disintegrates. A soul
cannot carry its karma around the universe with it, because this astral
light differs in quality and degree upon each separate orb. See Chap. II.
VII. When a soul enters the spiritual states of the soul world
(which Buddhists term Devachan), the power of its earthly karma can
never re-attract it to earth; its influence over the soul is forever lost.
64
The lower can never control the higher, when once they exist apart.
To assert that past fossilized karma can re·attract the soul from the
realms of spiritual happiness and re·project .it into the mire of earth
is to exalt matter to the tllrO
ile ol Deity, and degrade pure spirit to
the level of a passive brute substance.
From the above seven statements it will be seen that the Hermetic
initiates assert that karma js not the prinury law of consequences and
destiny. It is not an active principle, always at work, re..adjusting
Nature's ridiculous mistakes. Nature never yet made a mistake. Oil
the contrary, karma is shown to be a result; the subjective outcome of
innumerable laws and forces. and in this life it is utterly powerless to
effect either good or evil, so far as our destiny is concerned upon the
external plane. But, upon the interior plane, that is, upon or within
the astral sphere of the disembodied soul world, this karma becomes
the Book of Life from which all our actions in this world are judged.
At death, we are surrounded by and compelled to exist within our
own karma. \,Ye are forced by the Jaws of magnetic affinity to work
out our own redemption, ever face to face with the grim idols of our
earthly past. The foul, unlovely pictures of every unclean imagination
wiiJ haunt us, and set our \ICry souls aflame with the consciousness
of every injustice and wrong we have committed. The only redeeming
feature will be the good karma, the kind unselfish thoughts and noble
aspirations we have evolved; all our true, unselllsh love for our fellow-
crcatmes will spring up like Rowers at our feet, and help to aid and
brighten our path upward and onward tl>rough the spheres of puri-
6cation and purgatory. At last we shall enter the sphere of immortal
life where those whom we have loved below may be waiting to
greet us.
We have asserted that karma is utterly powerless to effect
either good or evil in so far as the material destiny is concerned.
\>VhHc thi$ i.s ta·uc within ~rtain limits bcco.usc korrnn is but the
astral record of the past, yet this statement requires explanation.
It is not the actions we commit. that can, in themselves, bring happi·
ness or misery, benefit or misfortune to the person, but it is the
effects which our actions have upon others that really produce
immediate material resu1ts. The precise effect which any action wi11
have depends entirely upon the peculiar mental states surrounding
us at the time and our own intentions. For instance, io one age it
KARMA 65
may be considered a very meritorious action to roast a poor helpless
medium under the name of a witch, but at another period such an
action will be followed by an indignant spirit of public resentment,
and a terrible penalty will be imposed by the law of the state to
satisfy the public sense of justice. The praiseworthy actions of one
age become the criminal acts of another. We see, therefore, that
the result of any action upon the material plane depends upon the
physical, moral, mental and spiritual development of the race. This
is not the case, however, within the astral soul world, where absolute
justice is the universal law. The mighty hero of a thousand fights,
who dies surrounded by all the pomp and vanity of public worship,
comes face to face with the fearful reality that he is, nevertheless,
a blood stained murderer, and as such he must work out his own
salvation amid trial and suffering. His purgatorial state will depend
in a great measure upon his motives, and the consciousness of his
earthly actions. If he was a true patriot, who fought against cruel
oppression simply for the love and liberty of his country and people,
his conscience will deal very lightly with him. But if love of fame
and martial glory were his chief motives, and constituted the greater
part of his karma, then so much the worse for him.
The reader will notice that in the Hermetic definitions of karma,
the soul when working out its past iniquities is perfectl'y conscious
of its task, and knows the true why and wherefore of its suffering.
Not only so, but it has also the certain hope of final emancipation,
not, however, until, as the parable says, "thou hast paid the uttermost
farthing." Herein, then, is the truth and justice of Nature's laws re-
vealed. But in the definition of Buddhism, this justice is absolutely
wanting. In their outrageous. scheme of esoteric philosophy, millions
of souls upon the earth are perfectly ignorant of what they are
suffering for. They are ushered into the world for the purpose of
undergoing the fiery torments of their old fossilized karma, and are
completely ignorant of the fact. How can the average mortal work
off his bad karma when he does not know that he. has any, nor
what he is working and suffering for? If we cruelly abuse a dog
when it is full grown for some offense committed when a puppy, it
would be considered an outrageous piece of cruelty, because the
dog would be perfectly ignorant of what the punishment was for.
The same may be said of inflicting punishment upon the material
66 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
man for some forgotten offense of his infancy. The reader should
ever remember that no punishment is just, when the one punished
is ignorant of the cause. Punishment under such circumstances not
only ceases to be just, but becomes diabolica1 injustice. The common
justice of humanity condemns such a proceeding. If this is true, how
much more severe must be the condemnation of that justice which
is divine?
At this stage of our subject, the student will doubtless ask, "if
human suffering is not the result of previous karma, what is the real
cause of so much misery in the world?" To this we reply, human
suffering is the result of innumerable laws, which in their action
and reaction produce discord at certain intervals in the scale of
human development. !<'or all practical purposes, they may be classed
under two heads as primary and secondary. The primary cause is
that of racial evolution. Each round and each race of the round
of human beings, requires different external conditions in order to
evolve its chief attributes; for each round and race become the
special means by which a certain one of the soul's attributes is
rounded out or developed. Let us illustrate. The first or primal race
were those of the Golden Age. They were a purely ethereal race of
beings, and cannot be strictly classified with what we know of hu-
manity, nor can they be said to have been really incarnated in gross
matter at all. For this reason, their penetrative power was very
small; hence, though highly spiritual, they were correspondingly
simple; they lived an ideal life amid semi-spiritual surroundings.
The second race, that of the Silver Age, penetrated deeper into
matter than the.ir Golden Age forefathers, and their bodies, conse-
quently became more dense and less sensitive. Toward the termina-
tion of this race, and the beginning of the third or Copper Age, the
equator of our racial arc was reached in the descending scale. Here
it was, that the first murmurings of a mental storm began to manifest
themselves; emigrations and partings took place between what had
previously been a united people, and consequently separate national
interests began to evolve. When our earth reaches the equinoctial
points of the year, storms and tempests abound. Upon a higher plane,
it is the same with the progress of man around the cycle. With the
Copper Age race a still further descent took place, and a still greater
increase of self-interest was evolved; from the national was evolved
KARMA 67
that of the family. Kings ascended thrones and sacerdotal systems
were formulated; the strong began to assert their greater force, and
the weak gradually sank into subjection. A still further descent and
we come to the fourth race, the bottom rung in the cyclic ladder, and
fittingly known as the Iron Age. This was the turning point of the
seven races wherein the soul attains its greatest penetrating power;
spirit can descend no lower. Kings and their priestly counsellors
became true despots, and the people were helpless and oppressed.
Next comes a higher evolution. The fifth race, beginning at
the end of the fourth, reaches up to the equinoctial line of the
mental arc in the ascending scale, and consequently another stormy
period commences. All is strife and turmoil. It is the struggle of the
oppressed against the oppressor. It is not the gentle mental storm of
the Silver equinox, because a spiritual period of light had preceded
that era, but it is the storm of war and bloodshed; of a fierce
democracy battling for the divine rights of man against usurped
authority. It is thus because the Iron Age of oppression has preceded
it. We are at the present day passing through this fearful equinocial
period. The fifth race is coming to a close, and already forerunners
of the sixth race are among the people, aiding in the spread of
glor~ous truth.
A spiritual, intellectual and scientific awakening is now taking
place. All peoples of the world are seeking truth and justice. While
the scientific world is producing miracles in their efforts to annihilate
time and space, and solve the many hidden mysteries of life. See
La Clef, Chapter VI. The sixth race of human beings now external-
izing here on the earth will develop intuition as a sixth sense, per-
ception through spiritual sensation, and learn to consciously use it
in their daily lives. They will intuitively know a thing without any
material evidence to support their knowledge, yet will find the truth
upon application or verification of the information received.
The secondary causes of human suffering are man·s ignorance, and
the re-actions of his animal nature. That is to say, man makes the
conditions that are necessary for his progress by alternately struggling
with and yielding to his own animal desires. But for this nature and
the experience the soul gains thereby, material incarnation might be
dispensed with. The state of suffering depends upon the race, as
before stated, but the effects of that suffering are in exact fulfillment
THC UCIIT OF EC\'PT
of Motlter ~ature's requirements. ~Iighty causes produce mighty
effects; results, let us sny, and vice versa. This law is absolute. To
every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Every spiritual
atom of life is the direct result of n cause. These atoms differ in power
nnd potency, as the stars di!fcr in magnitude. Nature's aim is for
diversity. In spite of the apparent fact that all forces are ever striving
for equilibrium. Nature's end, is the very opposite of equolity; for
the grand ultimate aim of e'·ery forre is the production of variety.
The only real dill'erence in any of her inJinite number of parts is that
of polarity. For instance, the only difference between the Hottentot
and the intellectual genius ol modem civilized society is that which
marks off their souls' respective polarity. It is only a question of per-
sonal opinion as to which of the two is the best and wisest. The
civilized shams and personal adornments of society may more than
counterbalance the crude dcoorntions of the savage. The false Theology
and cant of orthodox religion, combined with the many cr~·oneous
theories of so-called science, may more than make up few barbarian
ignorance; for many savage.~ nre more learned in the real laws of
Nature than some of our college professors. But be that a< it may,
!he savage will be the real gainer of tlte two in most cases, for he
,vilJ not have false dogmatic opinions to unlearn and forget. And,
lastly, we would add, that the moral character of any sa•·age will
compare very favorably with the morality of our populous cities.
In fact; making a.llowance for the planes of life occupied by each,
the external dill'erences between the two are only appearances, evolved
chiefly by our own thoroughlybiased and artificial educations. Another
factor in these secondary cnuses of human suffering is the human
will, or rather, man's capacity for utilizing the great will-for~-c of
the cosmos. lgnorance alone limits human possibilities in this direction.
It is man's place in Nature to sway the mighty pendulum of force
between the higher and the lower states of life (tlte super-mundane
and sub-mundane realms of being) and in so doing his mis.sion consists
in evolving the attributes of his soul, and gaining all the uperience
possible. If suffering is necessary to enable him to occomplish this,
then he will suffer. But, be the causes and consequences what they
mny in this life, depend upon it that what the soul suiTors from dis-
cord it will be justly compensated for by the sum total of results when
the cycle of its purification is over, and the past can be measured at
its true worth.
69
We have now presented, as concisely as possible, the Hennctic
explanation of karma, and shown that it is not the nil-ruling force
that Buddhism would mak~ u; believe.
Now we will expose the oriental delusion, and reveal its priestly
ol'ig.in. To begin with, we must carefully bear in mit1
d n rcw ull
important facts regal'ding the esoteric philosophy of tloe dreamy Oo
·icnt.
I. Anciently the real truth of all religion, especially those relating
to the soul, its nature, incarnations and karma, were rigidly concealed
from the people by a jealous priesthood with approval of the ruling
monarch.
II. Fiction was substituted in the place of truth, or, in other
words, the real truth was vcaed and the appearances of tnoth was
taught instead. And in order to obtain absolute power for the monarch
and the church, it became necessary to formulate the dogma that
their high priest, the pontilf or hierOt)hant as he wus called, was a
direct incarnation of the Deity, or a re-inc-~mation of thnt being.
Ill. In process of time the priests themselves became corrupt
and worldly, consequently, their spiritual perception sank into mental
lt:nection. Tlu::y uvt unly 1u.'lot the: secrets of their religion nnd myth-
ology, which were never committed to writing. but became themselves
the dupes of their own theoiQ~:y, and accepted their fommlated husks
as divine truth.
Edward Cibbon, in his historical classic, •The Decline and Fall
of the Homan Empire," published in 1776, records a thousand years
of wars, frauds and persecut<
ons. Emperors and bishops fought to
control; religious dogma was forced on the people, they had no choice;
the Athenian Philosophers were exiled or killed and their schools
dosed and teachings foo·biddcn. We have a similar example in the
christian clergy of today. as they seem determined every one must
accept their faith.
The researches of all genuine Occultists support the above as·
scrtions. The book •Isis Unveiled", teems with facts corroborating our
statements on kanna and re-incarnation. And Hcnnetic initiates ossert
most emphatically that both karma and re-incarn'!lion arc nothing
more than theological dogmas of an interested sacerdotal system. That
is to say, the teachings based upon these doctrines by the Buddhist
nnd other religious systems nrc false beca\o
se the real facts of re·
incarnation and karma were originally concealed, and then forgotten
in the lapse of time. It is very cn•y indeed to prove that the accepted
70 111E U(:ll1' 01"' ~YI ""f
theories of the Theosophical Buddhists of the present day are the
popular external dogmas taught to the ignorant masses ten thousand
years ngo. In support of this, the student should read "illuminated
Brnhminism, the true theosophy" by Ranga Hilyod, an ancient sage
of India.
The oldest records we possess show that human re-incarnation
and karma were the popular doctrines of the people. Upon this matter
A. P. Sinnet says; "This doctrine of knnna is one of the most interesting
features of Buddhist philosophy. There has been no secret about it
at any time." Certainly, this is exactly what 1
-(ennclic initiates claim.
It is a dogma of the Buddhist church, and was never concealed because,
being false, it was not worth concealing. On the contrary it was always
taught to the suffering masses groaning beneath despotic rule. It
was exceedingly potent liS n means of making the people submit quietly
to the authority of the church and the tyranny of the king, who
ahva)•s went hand nod glove with the priest. The masses were taught
to believe that by submitting to the yoke they were thus working
o££ previous bad karma; a very convenient doctrine we admit.
The chief Hierophant of Buddhism and the Thibetan adepts is
the Talcy Lama of Lhassa. "Every Lama," says Madam Dlnvatsky,
"is subject to the grand Taley Lnma, the Buddhist pope of Thibct,
who holds his residence at Utassa and is a re-incarnation of Uudclha."
This assertion fully corroborates what we said previously. :'olote well
the lnst sentence, "and is a re-inc:trnation of Buddha." Compare this
with the fact II on a preceding page. and you will sec once more
that we find the leaders of Thcosophie Buddhism re-asserting the
theological dogmas of a church nnd teaching them for truth. Buddhists
would have us really believe thnt Buddha continues to incarnate and
re-incarnate age after age. We can only say that no soul who has
passed through tlte trials of matrrial incarnation and the 6res of
spiritual purification would submit to c.:ontinunlly exist within a
material organism, nnd endure from age to age tl•e hell of n Grand
Lama's life. For the formulas, ccrt-monies and usages of a religious
potentate are indeed a hell to th~ pure in heart.
We shall be met face to face with the assertion that with very
high adepts and other exalted souls these things are different. that
Nature's laws arc either reversed or trnnscendcd. To this we would
•ay thnt such sl1ltements are folse; they ar<' of the same stamp as the
KARMA 71
Roman Catholic Bulls of the past, nothing but priestly word-juggling.
Nature is no respecter of persons, and neither Buddha nor any other
soul can continue to re-incarnate from age to age. The most that
such a dominant mind could do would be to obsess and mould an
unborn foetus to suit its purpose and then, by virtue of such obsession,
partially inhabit the same. Under these circumstances the physical
body is but the helpless machine of a dominant foreign mind, and we
need scarcely say that no purified soul would sink to such a plane of
existence. This question of obsession brings us to the subject of our
next chapter, therefore, we must bring the present one to a close.
The whole teaching of Re-incarnation and Karma as taught
by Buddhism, esoteric (?) or otherwise, is purely dogma; it is
materialism run to seed, combined with oriental speculations. It
is a huge system of selfishness, to work out _good here for the sake
of greater good hereafter. Such motives of exchange are corrupt. As
Socrates says; "We give up some small pleasures for still greater
pleasures." This, instead of being truly good, is the polar opposite.
MOTIVE ALONE is the proper cause of action, according to the
Hermetic doctrine. Do good for the sake of simple goodness and
virtue alone, not for the sake of gaining favor. There is too much
of this "I am holier than thou" about the oriental teachings of
karma. A prosperous, self-righteous Pharisee gloats over his previous
good karma when he sees his downtrodden brother and when he
aids it is because he thinks the karma of the action will well repay
him. Then again, when any serious case of suffering is presented to
these great Buddhist souls for their magical intervention and psycho-
logical aid, we are piously told that karma cannot be interfered with.
If, instead, they said that to aid was beyond their reach of power,
they would probably speak the real truth. Lastly, let us say distinctly
that the author has put the assertion of old Socrates (at the head of
this chapter) to the test. The whole of these Hermetic teachings have
been personally verified within the realms of spirit when free from
the control of the body, and therefore, we know whereof we write.
In our next chapter we shall deal with some of the so-called
evidences of re-incarnation and karma, and show them to be nothing
of the kind.

"All nrc hut l,_'lrt.'i of one .\tu(>Ct)dous whole.
\\'ItO~ hody N:ehlh' Is, :.nlt..l Cod th{' ~u1:·
''What is mediumship, and \\ho nrc the n>ediums?" was the
question we once a>kcd of the hutiated masters of Occult science.
The nnswcr re<.-eivcd wns as broad hl jts application as the universe
itself. "Everything is mediumistic, nnd every ntom is a medium ror
the expression of spiritual fort-e. Cod, alone, is the great central
controlling spirit," said the master. Long years of spiritual research
have ''~rified the tnoth of tbe answer received and have established
in the noind of the author the c~rtainty that every word is an
absolute fact.
We find throughout the vast infinitude of our universe that the
spiritual and the material are so inlimale thot any attempt to classify
and S<"Jl.t'r:.tP. thrm nr tn account for phenomena On the basis O( either
alon~. would be like erecting an edifice without a foundation. or
huilding upon ground as unstable nnd infirm as quicksand.
Modern science commencl's with matter, aud con.Gncs its re·
searches strictly lo the domain of material forces and forms, the plane
of monifestation. It tcnninntes at the very moment its path impinges
on the border of the impotdcmblc, "the unknowable," whereas the
real starling point of nil true science is within the spiritual s[laoes. the
cause plane. From this state its vast orbit sweeps downward throughout
the who1c univers~ of matie:. In mottcr it recogniz-es all the different
31tributes and tn:lnife:station; of the one Oivjne Force in every form
of creation. From here its decisions rctum to and again ultimate in
the r~nlm of spirit. Divinity is unity, and the two great attributes of
t·hc divine soul coniCJs<..-c :ts matter and spirit in tho universe of mnni·
fcstcd being. This is the duality of life. Matter is visible, it is solidified
~-pirit, the passive or negative principle in a concrete, condensed or
material form. Spirit is the mo,ablc. C\'er active, (')OSitivc principle in
motion, and between these two states there ramifies every grade
of being.
Mattr r ranges and tr:onsforms itself from tho lowe.<t dense state
of the minrral upwnrd to the aerial nnd invisible gnses, terminating in
MEDIUMSIDP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 73
the "universal ether" of science. In this refined condition, the active
and positive principles of Divinity, again, become united and are
transformed into creative force. Hence it must be apparent to the
thoughtful reader that, the universal ether contains within itself all
that is, that was, or that ever will be. Such being the actual facts
of the case, what are the logical conclusions that the student of
spiritual philosophy may draw therefrom?
They are briefly as follows;-
!. That the universe is one mighty, inconceivable medium, and
Deity the controlling and omnipotent spirit.
II. That Love becomes the medium of Wisdom, or, in other
words, the passive becomes the medium of the active, state; conse-
quently, matter is and must be the absolute medium of mind.
III. That the passive nature of the divine soul is the only means
whereby the active spirit of Divinity can manifest itself, and upon
this basis rests all the mysteries of the cosmos. This is Divine Love.
IV. In view of these facts, we find that the universal will, utilized
by the imperial soul of man, is the one true center of all magical and
spiritual power manifested upon our earth. Man is the great pivot
around which revolves every phase of magical, magnetic and mental
phenomena embraced within the realms of mundane psychology.
It has seemed necessary to the writer to re-impress all of the above
facts upon the mind of the reader, notwithstanding the fact, that they
have been very fully elaborated upon in the previous chapters, because
they constitute the very fundamental verities,-the actual principles,
which underlie the realities of mediumship, and therefore, are of
primary importance here.
Mediumship is a well-known term to the present generation. It
is applied to that state of sensibility which, though found pure and
natural in some individuals, has been artificially developed in others.
In this state they are enabled to come en rapport with invisible
intelligences, and other powers, both physical and mental, because
their odylic sphere (magnetic aura) has received a degree of sensitive-
ness compatible with their becoming mediums of communication for
said forces. A medium, properly speaking, is a person or object in
whom the capacity of reception and transmission is so fully evol~d
as to become of practical value in eliciting phenomena. After what
has been stated, it should appear perfectly plain, that all human beings
74 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
in their natural state are mediumistic; some in excess of others. This
is especially so when we comprehend the different types of men
and the relation of humanity to Deity. In a similar manner all
material substances are "mediumistic" in this sense of being capable
of receiving and transmitting force. Therefore, when considering
the various forms and phases of mediumship, instead of viewing
them in the light of "spiritual gifts," they must be viewed as the
natural attributes of our internal nature, as the positive potentialities
of the human soul. The various forms and degrees of mediumship
are not spiritual gifts in any sense whatever. They are, when viewed
from the interior plane, the awakened and active senses of the soul,
and hold the same relation to the spirit as our five external senses
do to the physical body. Just as our objective organism is governed
and controlled by absolute and eternal laws, strictly applicable to
its external nature, so is the internal, imponderable constitution under
the government of correspondingly transcendental laws equally in
harmony with its purely subjective nature. These laws constitute the
"Science of the soul," and it is only by a thorough knowledge of this
science that we can see the true realities of mediumship, understand
them, guard ourselves from its terrible dangers and enjoy without
fear its countless and unlimited blessings. By the aid of this glorious
knowledge we are enabled to perceive the action and interaction of
the two great planes of existence, and each coming day, observe with
renewed delight the marvelous transformations of mediumistic adapta-
bility. The flower that blooms in beauty, breathing forth to the air
its fragrance which is at once grateful to the higher senses. and
stimulating to the nerves, is a perfect emblem of Nature's faultless
mediumship.
The flower is a medium for the transmission of those finer essences,
to the human body, and of their spiritual portion to the soul; for the
aroma of the flower is spiritualized to such a degree as to act upon
the life currents of the human system, imparting to the spiritual body
a nutriment of the finest quality that physical substance can afford.
Herein may be seen some of the mysteries of incense, and the great
value of its use, especially in religious ceremonies.
• In this study of mediumship it must ever be remembered that
spirit inheres in every grade of matter as the instigator of life, force
and motion. It is attendant upon the ethereal currents that permeate
MEDIUMSHIP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 75
all worlds and bind the universe together as a complete whole. And,
in exact proportion to the refinement of substance, is the sphere
vitalized by spirit. In the brain and nervous system of the human
being the climax of material vitalization is reached. Here, spirit
blends with matter in such requisite force and grade as are sufficient
to form the astra-magnetic link of connection between the two
worlds of cause and effect. It is the same with mental powers;
intelligence is ever vitalized from the great Deific fountain of Wisdom;
Sympathy and Affection are derived from the same Deific fountain,
the soul of Love. No matter what the grade may be, whether that
of the seraph basking in the very sunlight of divine purity, of man
in his lowest estate, or of the brute raised but one degree above
the planes of inanimate Nature;-the spark which vivifies the brute,
the brilliant luminosity that lights up the brain of the perfectly
developed human being, and that radiant glory flashing from the
brow of the seraph, are alike kindled from the same eternal flame,
for it is the grand prerogative of each grade of being, differing in
degree of evolution, to transmit that which it receives from the realms
above to the planes immediately below, thus, is each one faithfully
fulfilling its duty as a medium in the scheme of life.
From the glorious pulsating soul of the central spiritual Sun,
descending through every sphere of creation, deep down into the
very bowels of matter, midst stratas of cold granite rock to the
mineral lodes of dense metal, one eternal and harmonious chain
of spirit mediumship prevails. Each plane depends upon the next
plane above, and each, in its grandly sequent rotation, transmits the
grosser portions to the planes below for their sustenance.
When the whole of this mighty scheme is taken into consideration,
Occult students will see how necessary it is for those who wish to
develop their spiritual possibilities to live upon a purely vegetable
diet, because the eating of flesh attracts the soul to the animal kingdom
and degrades the higher senses. A life spent amid the flowery fields
and pine clad mountains, is the only existence that can fit the mind
and educate the soul to the highest point compatible with material
existence. Upon the contrary, the thinking mind will not fail to see
that those who live in close, unhealthy, and densely populated towns,
and are surrounded by a group of sickly or selfish minded neighbors
and relatives, become subject to the very lowest planes of spiritual
76 UtE LICHT o•· ECYPT
activity. These conditions often fonn tl•e very hotbeds of error,
spiritual and mental, nod evolve the means of elementary obsession
and wickedness. Under such antagonistic conditions progress is
absolutely impossible, and those laboring under such adverse circum·
stances should avoid all contuc:l with mngic, spiritun1 phenomena
and rnedilllnship, ns the)' wou1d avoid coming in contnct with a
deadly pestilence.
It is to be hoped that these words of wa,·ning will be heeded
and thus save much suffering and useless waste of vitality.
Having given a general outline of the nature of mcdiumship,
it now becomes our duty to elucidate its laws and mysteries, and
here we are met with the mightiest subject within t.hc whole range
of Occultism. No brooch of >tudy is of greater importance in the
search of truth, or is more completely unknown and misunderstood
by that large body of modern mystics and thinkers of the present
day, who proclaim tho doctrines of an esoteric Buddhism to the
world as the essence of truth nnd wisdom. They must not understand,
for such as these show their lack of esoteric illumination on the little
known subject of medium$hit>.
~lediumship, though go••erned by well defined laws, so far as
its general principles arc concerned, is so subtle and intricate In its
different degrees, loiTOS and phases, as to be absolute!)• beyond the
grasp of the ordinary mind. In fact, its romifications and the results
of its actions are a.• unlimited ns the infinite. Therefore, it is only
tho 1norc prominent and apparent forms that wo shnll attempt to
outline. To do the subject justice more than one large volume would
he I'C"<(uired. As a matter or COIWenicnce. we shall divide the general
laws of mediumship into two gcncml classe.•; that of the oonh·olling
force, and that of the mediumistic instrument. known 10 initiates as

The trinity on the left belong,; to the controlling foroe; the
trinity on the right belong,; to the medium. In order to grasp the
full significance of the ahovc laws and of their intcr-rolntionship, it
must be borne in mind that the lower states of life are always the
MEDIUMSHIP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 77
mediums of and consequently subject to the higher states. Therefore,
every realm, from Deity down to the crystallized mineral, must not
only possess the quality of mediumship, but also exercise the power
of spirit control; the two extreme poles being Cod and crystallized
matter. To illustrate this idea let us take the organism of man. Man,
as we know him, is the mediumistic instrument through which higher
states manifest their wisdom and power. This mediumship, on general
lines, extends from the lowest specimen in the scale of humanity
upwards to the highest initiated adept; the only difference between
the two is that of development. This is an absolute fact. The exalted
adept is actually a medium, in one sense, for the expression of still
higher states of life than his own. No real adept denies this, though
mere mystical pretenders always do. In other words, the difference
is one of quality and degree, corresponding to their respective states.
Man, according to his state, assimilates the specific grade of life
essence from the universal force which corresponds exactly to the
quality and development of his soul. As man ascends higher in the scale
of spiritual development he becomes· the recipient of finer essences,
the coarser atoms are repelled and transmitted to less perfect organ-
isms. This transmission goes on until the lowest state of humanity is
reached, and from thence the life essence is transmitted ·to the sub-
mundane realms of life, which thus, become the mediums for the
expression of the surplus spiritual force rejected by man. This primal
life force, in its original purity, contains all the requisite grades of
spiritual nutriment for every form of existence in the universe, from
God to the mineral. The mineral is the terminus, so to say, from
which all phenomena react. There is no medium below this state. It
is not the end of creation by any means, but only the turning point in
the scheme of creation, where force comes to a focus and from which
it reacts in both directions. Within each realm the same laws are also
in force. Those forms of life which, by comparison, are passive, be-
come the mediums for those which are active. Ascending to the mental
plane we find it precisely the same with knowledge. The active re-
search of powerful penetrating minds accumulates this knowledge, and
then formulates the same into systems composed of more or less
truth and error. This combination of wisdom and ignorance consti-
tutes a religious sect or school of philosophy, which, in turn, impresses
its force upon the less positive minds of the masses. The ignorant,
78 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
therefore, become the mediums of the wise. This wisdom may only
merit such a name, however, by comparing it with the ignorance by
which it is surrounded. The sum total of a nation's wisdom or ignor-
ance may always be found by examining its, laws, constitution and
religion. We find the same law in force in politics. A great political
leader, a giant mind, impresses its force upon a circle of kindred but
less positive minds. These, in turn, react upon others, transmitting
the same power of thought to them, and so on until that central
mind;-like a sun, sways the destiny of millions of its fellow-crea-
tures. These millions are simply the mediums for the expression of
mental force. Again, the visible head or center of this force may, in
its turn, be the medium of some other invisible head, whether such in-
visible power be mortal or spiritual, embodied or disembodied, makes
no difference to the law. This might be termed a form of mass psy-
chology if on the mental plane. All of these forms and phases, how-
ever, are to be classed as unconscious mediumship; because it seldom
transpires that the operator is conscious of the magical powers he is
using, or that the mediums are conscious of their mediumistic sub-
jection.' We think these brief illustrations will convey to the reader's
mind something of the magnitude of the present subject.
We will now briefly notice a few of the most prominent forms of
mediumship recognized as having a more direct connection with
practical Occultism at the present time; the mediumship of spiritual-
ism, and then conclude with some of its more recondite phases.
The sine qua non of all trance, or physical mediumship, is em-
braced in the term "passivity," and exactly in proportion to the degree
of passivity attained is the power or strength of a person's medium-
ship increased. The question as to whether a given person may de-
velop into a trance speaker or into a physical medium depends first,
upon the brain conformation, and secondly, upon the magnetic tem-
perament of the body. Some individuals are so complex that they
may become either one or the other, according to the prevailing will
of the developing circle. The chief point to be observed in these
forms of mediumship, is that they tend toward the destruction of in-
dividuality, the medium becomes a slave to those in control. They can
only be attained in the passive state, and the developing process is a
means toward destroying whatever amount of will power the poor
medium might have originally possessed. This destruction of the
MEDIUMSIDP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 79
human will (subjection to spiritual intelligences as spiritualists ignor-
antly call it), is the greatest curse of mediumship. The controlling
forces of such willless creatures may be anything and everything, ac-
cording to "conditions" and circumstances. A medium that is said to
be "developed"? stands upon the public platform, and is supposed to
be controlled by some disembodied intelligence. But in nine cases out
of every ten it is the psychological influx of the audience which, cen-
tering upon the sensitive organism of the medium, produces that pe-
culiar semi-mesmeric state known as trance. Under such conditions
the inspired oration will harmonize with the majority of the minds
present, and, in numberless cases, the exact thoughts of individuals in
the audience are reproduced. To the orthodox spiritualist, the oration
will be received as an actual inspiration received from the "Spirit
World" of translated humanity. Spiritualists should learn the fact,
that mediums who can be controlled by a spirit can be equally con-
trolled by a living person, and further, that of all places, the public
platform is the least likely spot to be the center of high spiritual in-
spiration which emanates from ascended human souls. .
Those forms of mediumship, known as Psychometry and Clair-
voyance, depend chiefly upon the degree of sensitiveness attained; as
brain formation and magnetic temperament possess only secondary
influence in their evolution. Consequently, animals as well as human
beings may possess these phases. Their characteristics are too well
known to require further notice.
We must now notice two of the most subtle, and so far almost en-
tirely unsuspected forms of this type of spirit mediumship. The first
we will designate as "semi-transfer of identity," and the second as
"thought diffusion."
In a previous chapter we have shown how a person, during his
life, possessing an active, potent mind, will leave within the spaces of
the astral light powerful thought forms or psychic thought embryos.
These thought forms are the earth karma of the human soul. Now,
under certain conditions, this earth karma of disembodied souls can
be, and is contacted by those still in the flesh. Thus, for example, a
person of strong positive mind, having rendered his soul sphere sen-
sitive to contact by a partial development while his brain still re-
mains positive, becomes a true medium, so far as the soul sphere is
concerned, and always without knowing it (unless properly initiate(~).

ity to the center of such thought, they gradually impress their force and
ultimately (in the majority of cases) subject that soul to their dominant
ideas, and so prepare the way for the reception of the doctrines they
want to teach. In this way, by the subtle mental magic of its devotees,
religious theology obtained its first foothold upon the human mind.
Though the action of this mediumship is sure, as long as the positive
ideas have sufficient force to conquer, the reaction is equally certain,
and it is this re-action that ultimately destroys the Theology. The magi-
cal offspring destroys its magical progenitor.
This diffusion of ideas is in active operation upon every mental
plane; thus one potent mind evolving thought forms in Boston may
suddenly set in vibration hundreds of sympathetic but less positive
minds upon the other side of the Atlantic. They begin to think simi-
lar ideas, and to form similar conclusions. These ideas may become
universal and constitute public opinion, if the projecting minds are
potent enough. But few, very few indeed, are conscious of such rami-
fications of mental magic. Esoteric Buddhism owes its origin to such
magic, and depends absolutely upon such Occult processes for its con-
tinued existence, but re-action is already apparent. Its followers never
dream that instead of being independent, self-conscious thinkers, they
are the mediumistic sensitives of Oriental control. The reader should
never forget that upon the external plane there is nothing so potent as
the magic of the human mind.
The conflicting theories of Buddhistic Theosophy on the one
hand, and Spiritualism on the other, regarding the nature and source
of those invisible forces which produce the various kinds of phenom-
ena known to modern spiritualism, have given rise to much perplexity
in the minds of many earnest truth seekers. The spiritualist, as a rule,
affirms that such phenomena are due wholly to the action of disem-
bodied human souls (many advanced spiritualists now freely admit
the possibility of other intelligences than those of humanity controlling
mediums); while the Theosophist utterlv denies the possibility of such
a course (except in the case of his Mahatmas, or with vicious human
elementaries), and asserts that all the various forms and phases of
spiritualistic phenomena are produced by one or more of the follow-
ing agencies, either singly or combined:
I. Elemental spirits, termed spooks.
II. Human elementaries (the lost souls of depraved mortals).
82 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
III. Disembodied shells (the lifeless forms of disembodied mortals).
IV. The mesmeric influence of living individuals.
The actual truth is midway between these two extremes.
It is, indeed, a most glorious fact that disembodied human souls
can and do return and commune through various mediumistic natures
with embodied humanity. Still, the action of these souls is chiefly con-
fined to, and manifested upon, the impressional and inspirational
planes of mediumship. In so far the spiritualist is correct. There is,
however, much truth, together with much that is false, in the Theoso-
phist's theory. Let us, therefore, consider the agencies just mentioned,
and in the order given.
I. Elemental spirits, termed spooks. There are innumerable classes
and species of impersonal elementals in the various rounds and spaces,
but only three classes have any influence upon mediums and spiritual-
istic phenomena. The first and lowest in the scale of intelligence, is
the class of cosmic elementals, generated in the four realms of Occult-
ism;-Fire, Earth, Air and Water. These creatures cannot deceive the
medium. They are incapable of personating or imitating anything
beyond themselves, unless they are impelled to do so by the medium's
internal desire for such deception. In this case they may obey the im-
pulse of the medium's mind. As they are completely subjective to the
human will, they possess no real individuality of their own. When
psychically directed, they simply are the blind forces of Nature,
either active or latent according to magnetic conditions, and, there-
fore, would be correctly designated as the undeveloped mind of mat-
ter. The.second class in the scale of intelligence is the Animal Ele-
mentals. These beings are the souls of animal forms of life under-
going the magnetic cycle of their impersonal existence within the
astral spaces of the "Anima Animalis." When any animal dies upon
the earth, it undergoes another cycle of life within the karmic spaces
of its kind in the astral world. Here it evolves the forces and con-
ditions to be utilized for its next incarnation. These souls, if we may
call them such, especially those of domesticated animals, frequently
become attached to human beings on earth with whom they have some
peculiar magnetic affinity, or to whom they become attached during
their external life. It is these beings that become the innocent in-
struments of fraud. They respond to the desires of the medium or to
the secret wish of the circle or those who consult the medium. Under
MEDIUMSHIP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 83
these circumstances it will invariably transpire that when a person,
who possesses a positive opinion, consults a medium upon any given
subject, the answer he receives will correspond to his thoughts, whether
it be correct or otherwise. The same thing will happen when the
client asks the advice or the opinion of a medium upon worldly matters.
The answer will always respond to the secret desire which the animal
elemental perceives in the mental sphere of the inquirer. This "con-
trol" cannot be charged with fraud any more than a pet dog can be
charged who fulfils his master's desire. The benighted ignorance of
both medium and client is the only cause for the apparent fraud.
Mediums who become the instruments of this class of intelligences are
generally those of unbounded personal egotism. They formulate the
idea that their spirit guides cannot be any other than the most exalted
personages. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron and the whole of
the prophets have in tum been claimed as their inspiring guides by
this class of mediums. Such is not the case, except in the most rare
instances. The obliging imitative soul of the animal_ elemental feels
the full force of the medium's egotistical thought desire and immedi-
ately responds thereto and fulfils this mental idea. Even Jesus Christ
and Buddha have been thus personated by impersonal controls who
easily deceive the medium. But no matter who they claim to be
they will always correspond to the ideal image of tte personage
existing in the medium's mind. If the medium be ignorant of the
life, times and circumstantial surroundings of their ideal guide,
when he lived on earth, then their ideal guide will be equally
ignorant of himself. The writer has frequently met with spirits
claiming to be Pythagoras who did not comprehend the first principles
of Occultism, and who had entirely forgotten the order he instituted
or the country he belonged to. We have met with Roger Bacon spooks
who had never heard of alchemy and knew nothing of monastic
life; with Ben Jonsons, who knew nothing of the times in which
he lived on earth; with Shakespeares, who had forgotten their own
plays, and the humble circumstances of the poet's early life. Nearly
all these instances occurred where the mediums were actually con-
trolled by the astral souls of domestic animals, chiefly dogs. This
class, and also the cosmic elementals, are the chief agencies in
all physical phenomena as they act under the control of human
souls. The reason we assert that they were dogs is because, having
8t THE LICHT OF EGYPT
evolved the lucid state, we ourselves could see the thoughtless
impersonal creature responding to every latent thought in their
medium's mind. When we formulated the positive thought that
the control was not what he represented himself to be, he would
generally confess that he was not, whereupon the medium would
commence blaming "the conditions" for the poor report. Our per-
sonal investigations, extending over a series of years in England,
France, Germany, Austria and the United States, with various
types and phases of mediums, prove most conclusively that nearly
half of that class of mediums who style themselves "business
clairvoyants" and "test mediums" are controlled by various kinds
of animal elementals, or "spooks." The third class in the scale of
intelligence is the magnetic elementals, corresponding to the seven
planetary divisions of Nature. These intelligent creatures are too
bright and ethereal to be guilty of fraud. They are generated by
the life forces of the planetary chain existing within each orb, and
are the intermediate agents of the physical results of planetary
influences manifested on the earth. They are the attendant familiars
of certain classes of mystical students, especially those devoted to
alchemy and astrology. It is these beings that usually produce the
visions in crystals, magic mirrors, or vases of water, and in conse-
quence of this they have often been wrongly termed planetary
angels by certain schools of magical research. They are indeed
planetary in nature, but they do not belong to the physical planet
to whose nature they correspond except by affinity. They pertain
to our own orb equally as much as man himself, and can give much
information regarding the orb under whose dominion they act.
If any deception transpires through them, it is but the reflection
of deception (misunderstanding) existing in the minds of those who
use them. They do not and cannot control mediums by mesmerism
or by trance. Their sole influence is manifested in the impressional
and clairvoyant phases of mediumship.
II. Disembodied Human Elementaries. This class is made up
of the animal souls of depraved, wicked mortals who have sunk
beneath the human plane and thus caused the separation of their
divine soul from their conscious individuality. Those who fall so
low as this are generally evil magicians and sorceresses, who are
far more numerous than civilized society has any conception of.
MEDIUMSHIP-ITS NATURE AND MYSTERIES 85
This class are really magnetic vampires who prolong their viciOus
existence by sapping the life blood of their mediumistic victims.
They will personate anything and everything. Their only aim is
to completely demoralize the mediums and plunge them into all
kinds of depravity. The chief characteristic of the Human Elementary
is obsession, and nearly all those who go insane through religious
excitement are the victims of elementary obsession. It is needless
to add that these vampires are lost to all that is redemptive and
good; they have gravitated to the lowest realms of brute animality
in 1\"ature upon the descending arc, and ultimately they become
indrawn within the death whirl of that magnetic orb known as
the dark satellite, and are swept to their final doom, extinction.
III. Disembodied shells. These are the magnetic forms of those
who have lived, died and been buried upon the earth. They are
perfectly lifeless; they hover around the grave which conceals the
corpse to which they are bound, and as this decomposes the mag-
netic shell or phantom also dissolves. They cannot be drawn away
from the grave. They cannot, in fact, be made to answer any
mediumistic purpose whatsoever, and those who assert, as some
Theosophists do, that they can be regalvanized into a temporary
life and made to simulate the deceased individual, are sadly in
error, and know not whereof they speak. The Buddhistical theory
of disembodied shells and their influence upon the mediums of
modern spiritualism is only another of the oriental delusions, dis-
seminated to poison the budding spirituality of the western race.
IV. The Mesmeric influence of living individuals. Of this potent
factor we need not speak, as it is evident that any spirit medium
will feel, and to some extent respond to, the mesmeric will of a
potent, positive, magnetic mind.
CHAPTER V
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE
THE HERMETIC KEY OF URANIA'S MYSTERIES
Written in the year 1880
PREFACE
Esteemed Brother Students of the Occult;
In preparing this peculiar work, I have been requested by
those in authority over me to avoid all superfluous matter, and
present the facts and teachings of the Hermetic Initiates as con-
cisely as possible in the form most suitable for private meditation
and study. But for this request, I could probably have made the
work much more readable and interesting to many who dislike
the dry facts and figures of original research. As it is, each one
must supplement the scenery and sentiment for him or herself,
and thus gain the credit of intensifying their own special pleasure,
knowledge and Spiritual Advancement.
It is most important to remember that the Original Manuscript
of the first portion of this work was written and issued to several
in the month of January, 1881, before "Esoteric Buddhism" ever
saw the light, and that the supposed "marvelous and original doc-
trines," issued by A. P. Sinnet, Esq., as from India, were all in
black and white in England at the time. We have not copied from
"Theosophy," but it is they who have stolen their jewels from us.
In corroboration of this fact, read "Coleman's Review" of "The
Secret Doctrine."
In trying to explain the Esoteric Numbers of the ancients,
there is one great difficulty to be met with, namely, to be esoterically
understood. Therefore, those who cannot understand or appreciate
the sublime significance of the mighty Cycles and Periods we are
about to reveal, had better, by far, leave all studies tending in the
direction of the occult alone, seeing that it is not their sphere of
thought. Their souls are not sufficiently etherealized for their
humanly-divine attributes to come into action, and in spite of any
THE HERMETIC KEY OF URANIA'S MYSTERIES 87
ephemeral curiosity towards mystical research, they will never
advance further than the gates of the outer court; they cannot, as
yet, pass the fearful Dweller on the Threshold and enter the Holy
Place. Therefore, they must be content to await their time, until the
conditions are evolved by succeeding ·races of the human gamut
that will admit of their soul's latent attributes unfolding themselves-.
There are, also, many who, while being in a condition to see the
truth and grasp the real significance of the Mysteries of Nature, are
totally unfit to receive such knowledge, because of their natural,
but terrible elemental affinity. This fearful physical condition would
lead them to devote all the occult powers at their command to
worldly purposes. It is quite unnecessary to say that these individuals
would become a scourge to mankind. Happily, only a very few of
this class can grasp any real power, but become themselves the
dupes and slaves of the powers they seek to control. To all such
we earnestly and solemnly say;-abandon all thought of spirit inter-
course, flee from occultism and spiritualism as you would from a
.pestilence, and may the Divine Guardians of the human race preserve
your souls from the bottomless chasm upon whose brink they may
possibly have been unconsciously reposing. For those who merely pry
into the occult out of mere curiosity, we have nothing to say; they
will obtain as much as they deserve and no more. "Ask and ye shall
receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you," is just as true to-day
in reference to esoteric knowledge as it was 1900 years ago; but
it always presupposes that the one who asks or the one who knocks
is in real earnest and seeks only to satisfy the deep yearnings of an
immortal soul. The doorkeeper of the Temple of Truth is as deaf
as the granite rocks to all others. You may ask and shout until you
are hoarse, and knock and becudgel the door until you rouse up the
furies with the din, it is all to no purpose; you can never take the
Kingdom of Heaven by storm. It is fabled in the Holy Scriptures that
Satan tried this means of obtaining power once upon a time and
got hurled, with all of his assistants, into the flames of hell for such
daring presumption, and that instead of the Kingdom of Heaven he
obtained the bottomless pit as a fitting reward for his misdirected
ambition and labor. There is more redl truth in this religious fable
than spiritualists ever dreamed of. But to the true student of Nature's
inner laws we say, rest assured that you will receive a full measure
88 THE I.TCHT Or

of reward for aU and every earnest endeavor. Urania's lamp wi.ll
ultimately shine upon your dark and difficult path, and you shall
indeed sec the "saving light of the world," which will enable you to
draw aside the veil of the mystic Isis, and behind this magic curtain,
read the ever-burning truths of Nature inscribed upon the scrolls
of time.
It is to you, my faithful and eternal brethren, that I present
the Esoteric Cycles, the Golden Key, and the Silver Locks that guard
our island Universe, viz.: the planet upon which we exist, which
in itself, is a miniature Universe; so, also, is the human organism.
In your possession, I know, they will be valued according to their
true worth, and utilized for their proper purpose. Therefore, trusting
that you may use your psychic powers wisely, worthily and well, and
wishing you God-speed upon the upward path of your soul's eteroal
destiny, 1 remain with fraternal sympathies and brotherly love,
Most faithfully yours,

LA CLEF HEHMETlQUE
SECfiON I
Tilt:: CYCLES A.~D l~ORCl·;$ OF CREATIVE LIF£
In attempting to explain the suhlime system of Esoteric Cycles,
as taught in the Occult schools of the Egyptian :Vh1gi, we shall notice
their great Cycles Grst, which relate to Human and Planet:ary Evolution,
then compare, or rather introduce, for the student's comparison,
the Sacred Cycles of Hindoo Initiates, and show some of their
striking relationships to the well known facts of geological research,
and, lastly, attempt to show how these natural periods of action
and reaction of the Cosmic life forces have formed the truthful
foundation upon which the Astrological ~1ystics have elaborated
their planetary periods and sub-cycles of celestial inAuence over
nations, and which is further and more fullyelaborated by Kabbalistical
Jorc, in the rule of the Seven Arch Angels as the seven Governors
of the world. which they s•y "after Cod actuate the Universe."
NATUnE'S Tl\IUNE lNOEX
Nature has furnished her students with the means of reaching
her mysteries, in the dual fol'm of intuition and intellect. and of
measuring her mighty forces in the forms of time and space. The
first index of time is the aotation of the Earth upon her axis, the
second by her annual motion about the Sun. These are broadly
converted into days, montl1s and years. The third index is that of
the motion of the Earth's center (the Sun) through space, around
a still grcatcl' center; this is broadly divided into two measures, viz..;
O
rst, through one sign of the Zodiac, a period of 2,160 years, and
secondly, through the entire twelve signs, which c<>mplete his grand
revolution, or great Solar Year, in 2.5,920 years of Earthly time. The
third and last face of the triune index is our Earth's Pole. This
magnetic point is the great finger of Natwc's Cyclic Timepiece,
which governs and registers all the great Cosmic cycles of our pJanet
and its circuit.
90 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
Remember this significant fact, then, that the motions of the
Earth's Pole is the motion of her Evolutionary forces, both Human
and Physical.
POLAR MOTION
When this beautiful motion of the Earth's Pole has become
familiar, the student will begin to see the divine harmony of Nature's
grandest law, which law causes every portion of our Earth's surface
to become alternately a fruitful plain or barren waste; dry land or
ocean bed.
The "Earth's Pole moves in one uniform direction, with a slow,
imperceptible motion that forms a spiral path in the heavens, con-
sisting of a number of small spiral orbits, or circles, one overlapping
the other. These small spiral circles are termed Volutes, their true
value in space being three degrees, thirty-six minutes, no seconds.
3° 36' 00''.
The motion of inclination of the Pole is at the rate of fifty seconds
of space per century, or one second in every two years. At this rate,
it requires 7,200 years to move over one degree, and as there are 360
degrees in a circle, or the Pole's orbit, it takes 360 times 7,200 years,
equal to 2,592,000 years, to make a complete revolution of its orbit,
or one hundred Solar Years.
Each Volute being three degrees, thirty-six minutes, no seconds
in true value, 25,920 years are required for the Pole to complete one
small spiral orbit, and as there are exactly one hundred of these Spiral
Orbits in the complete orbit, therefore 100 times 25,920 years equals
2,592,000 years, which period is termed, by Initiates, one Polar Day.
One Polar Day equals one hundred Solar Years.
We will now give a few brief examples of Polar Motion:
If the student will, for a moment, imagine our Earth's Pole to
be perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, and consequently coinciding
with the Pole of the ecliptic; then the signs of the zodiac, and the
apparent yearly path of the Sun will always be vertical at our Earth's
equator; hen~e universal spring will reign in the Temperate Zones
and a gentle, continuous summer in all sub-tropical latitudes; it
will cause the equatorial regions of the Earth to become blazing,
scorching deserts. The great plains will be unfit for habitation, owing
to the fierce rays of a vertical Sun, continuing for long ages. Only
the mountainous portions will be the seat of human life. This condition
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECTION I 91
will also cause equal day and night all over the globe, but as we recede
from the Equator, north or south, the sunlight becomes less and less,
owing to the Sun attaining a lesser degree of altitude with every
degree of latitude; until, at the Poles, the Sun will only appear as
a dull red ball of fire, moving along the horizon, from east to west,
in the twelve hours from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., hence, darkness and uni-
versal winter reign supreme; and the Arctic Circle is an ever-lasting
belt of ice and snow, whose frozen breath forms a complete barrier
against the existence of human life.
Again, imagine the Earth's Pole, after a lapse of 648,000 years,
and we shall now find that it is inclined at an angle of exactly 90
degrees, for, during this Period, it has been slowly, but imperceptibly
to the Earth's inhabitants, moving or inclining away from the pole
of the ecliptic. The twelve signs of the zodiac and the apparent yearly
path of the Sun, are now vertical to the Pole of the Earth. What will
he the fearful geological results? Why, that our polar regions will
have a tropical summer. Each year the Sun will be vertical on the
21st of June to the North Pole, and on the 21st of December to the
South Pole, and also that every portion of the globe, with the Sun
and Earth's Pole in this position, will witness a tropical summer and
an arctic winter. This accounts for and fully explains the existence
of fossil remains of the seal, walrus and polar bear in the burning
plains of Africa and Hindustan, and of the tropical remains now being
discovered in the Arctic regions. No human being now living can
conceive the fearful natural phenomena yearly transpiring during
this period. For instance, all latitudes below the Poles had two
midsummers each year; namely, when the Sun ascended north, and
when it returned south again. The rapid rate at which the Sun rose
into the polar circles, and the terrific heat of a vertical Sun upon the
ice and snow, must have caused the most frightful inundations upon
all the plains and lowlands. No wonder that it was called the Age
of Horror by the Hindoos and Egyptian Magi.
The walls of the mighty Babylon and the eight-volved Tower
of Babel or cloud-encompassed Bel were never constructed to resist
any mortal foe. NO. Those city walls, which were 60 miles in circum-
ference, 200 feet high, 578 feet thick, were not made to defy the
strength of armies, but to resist the fearful forces of Nah1rc, the
Hoods that swept the plains of Shinar, from the mountains of Armenia,
every spring durjng this Age of Horror. The trcrncndous embankments
and river walls <.-onstructed h:r the Ancients are Jnonumenl's of huulnn

"Assyrian chiefs bade Babel's tower arise,
On Shinar's plain, aspiring to the skies,
Whose eight-volved dragon, turning round the whole,
Shows that eight cycles round the northern pole
At four degrees asunder, closed their view,
Which proves latitude was thirty-two.
And still in thirty-two, beneath the starry host,
The eight-coiled Dragon moulders in the dust,
By Cyrus overthrown, who raised the pile
Round which the Stars and Dragon used to coil;
But still its form, its history declares,
An hoary age of twice two hundred thousand years."
93
It may be noted that the very ancient sacred towers in the Pagodas
of China always (unless they are of modern construction) faithfully
indicate their latitude and date of their first foundation by the number
of stories or terraces. Of course it is not supposed that these towers,
like our ancient cathedrals, are not periodically restored as they fall
into decay, but always on the same principle.
A great deal more might be said as to the different climates
that ensued under different inclinations of our Earth's Pole, but
these few illustrations will give the student a few ideas as to the
actual cause of the various geological changes that are brought
about by Polar Motion. Remember that the great Polar Day (2,592,000
years, moving once around, like the index of the clock) determines
the duration upon our planet of that vital spiritual impulse of
evolution, known among students and Initiates as the Great Life
Wave. This Life Wave passes around the septenary chain, or circuit,
of the seven planets, not in an even, regular, continuous action, but
in waves or impulses. For instance, suppose the Life Wave of the
mineral evolution commences, upon planet number 1; it will here
go through its active evolution, and then, having reached its
culminating point, it commences to flow, or pass on to planet number
2, and the vegetable, or next life impulse, begins upon planet number
1, and so on with the rest. Upon this point we would refer the
student to Mr. Sinnett's valuable book, Esoteric Buddhism, but
reminding you that, although there are many outlines in the work
similar to these teachings, they are, in reality, widely different, as
will be seen when you read his conclusions and those of this
revelation.
In order to better illustrate the evolution of matter and the
involution of spirit, we will briefly describe in outline the systematic
94 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
and harmonious process followed by Nature in the complete evolution
of a planet, similar in construction to our earth.
In the first place, it must be borne in mind that there are Seven
Kingdoms, Seven Principles and Seven Ruling Powers in Nature,
a trinity of sevens, and also that matter, so called, is but the most
remote expression of spirit. The further a state is removed from
its source, the more dense it becomes, until spirit can express itself
in metallic form and become materialized as veins and lodes of
mineral ore in the body of a planet, and tower itself upon that
planet's surface in granite mountains, limestone hills or chalky dells;
and that the boundless space is filled with a fine, invisible form
of condensed spirit, known to scientists as cosmic dust; and, lastly,
that Nature's operations are performed in an endless series of waves,
which, in their motion, form graceful curves, the rise and ·fall of
the arc of the curve forming its cycle of duration.
The Seven Kingdoms are the Three Elemental and invisible,
and the Four Objective and visible planes of Nature, while the order
of the Seven Principles, or forms of evolution, is as follows; 1, the
Spiritual; 2, the Astral; 3, the Gaseous; 4, the Mineral; 5, the Vegetable;
6, the Animal; 7, the Human; see chapter II of section I.
The Seven Governors, or Powers ruling a planet, are the Seven
Angelic States, mentioned more fully in LaClef chapter VI.
Having explained the rudiments, it will better express our mean-
ing to use a Biblical illustration, so we will now esoterically explain
THE SIX DAYS OF CREATION,
mentioned in Genesis, each Day being one Polar Day, as before stated,
or 2,592,000 years of Earthly time.
The words "the evening and the morning" signify the two halves
of the Polar Cycle. You will notice that "the evening" is mentioned
first, and "the morning" last. This is correct. The dark or undeveloped
portion of each wave is the first half, and signifies, symbolically, Night,
and vice versa. Further, it must be remembered that the spiritual
impulse, or wave, must of necessity pass round the orbit that has
ultimately to be traversed by the future planet before anything can
transpire. It is the Divine Will sent forth by the spirit-state that is
equivalent to the Word or Divine Idea of certain ancient writers.
This Fiat attracts within its orbit the latent cosmic matter of space,
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECTION I 95
and transforms it into the embryonic, nebulous light, the star dust
or radiant fire mist, which is the form, or primitive matter, of all
creation. The student must strictly remember that there is no specific
duration of this state. It may last for millions of ages before the actual
evolution of a planet, and that previous to the symbolical Six Days
of Creation this planet exists for untold cycles in a nebulous condition,
the exact size of its orbital ring, This being understood, we will
describe
The First Day of Creation. The Supreme Angelic Governors
project into active evolution the astral tide-wave, viz., the currents
of astral light, and the nebulous matter is, at once, transformed into
a rapidly revolving globe of fire, which solidifies and cools under
the intense concentration of the Deific Will of the Governors in a
wondedully less space of time than any of our transcendental or
spiritual writers can imagine. Fire was dominant for the first half
of the Polar Day;-when its sudace had become so far cooled as
to allow the heated vapors of its immense atmosphere to condense
and form water, which element was rapidly produced· during the
next half of the cycle. Thus, we see, that a rude globe was formed
during the first day of creation; the first half, the evening, was given
to the dominion of fire alone, and the latter half, or morning, was
one ceaseless war between those opposing elements, fire and water.
"And the evening and the morning were the first day." These two
periods of the Polar Cycle are each 1,296,000 years, and were called
by the Hindoos the Treta Yug.
The Second Day of Creation. The Supreme Angelic Governors
now caused the first evolution of the gaseous or chemical tide-wave,
and the evolution of a complete but dense atmosphere was the result.
That is to say, the various constituents of the atmosphere were, by
this wave, adjusted, and our planet's chemical affinities duly balanced.
This caused the whole of the superabundant gross matter, such as
carbon, etc., to condense and fall to the sudace of the planet. During
this day, also, our planet's surface was the scene of a continual con-
flict between heat and water; all was the scene of mighty volcanic
action; mountain ranges continually rose and fell, and the ocean
beds were always shifting.
The Third Day of Creation. After the gaseous, the great mineral
tide-wave commenced, and the spirit atoms of future egos became
96 THE LlCHT Ot· EC\'PT
incarnated in dense matter for the first time, namely, in the stratas
of rocks and mineral lodes which constitute the stony ribs and metallic
veins of our planet. Mountains, valleys, islands and continents were
formed; the land above the ocean level sank, and the bed of the
ocean became dry land. Now, for the first time, the seas and oceans
occupy their proper beds. "And the <wening and the morning were
the third day." It must be added that during this period, also, the
planet's surface was the scene of continual volcanic action; as was
each and every period. At the close of this, the third Polar Cycle,
we sec that the evolution of the astral, chemical nnd mineral waves
have now prepared our Earth for the first vegetable forms of life.
And here, be it noted, that the first forms of all things were born
(that is, had their origin) in water.
The Fourth Day of Creation. The vegetnblc tide-wave now
reaches the barren shores of our planet, and produces the first rudi-
mental forms of vegetable life, which develop into the most gross,
gigantic shapes, rude and imperfect as the earth upon which they
grow. But, as time progresses, so does the vegetable kingdom; each
age gMng more perfect forms. "And the evening nod tlte morning
were the fourth day."
•
The Fifth Day of Creation. The previous tide-waves having run
their course, the animal lifc·wave now sets in, nnd from the lowest
rudimental forms of life successively evolve the various orders of
animal life, race after race appearing, running its course and becoming
extinct, giving place to more complete organisms. "And the evening
and tho morning were the fifth day."
The Sixth Day of Creation. The preceding five tide-waves of
evolution have now prepared our Earth for Nature's grandest climax;
the evolution of the human form, Man, for at this age we read;
"And the Lord made man out of the dust of tlte ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life, and he bec.•me n living soul; and
the Lord created man in His own image, male and female created
He them."
During the 6vc days of creation the vegetable and animal have
been evolvod, and, when man appears upon the scene, everything
is in a vastly improved and highly developed condition, compared
with the condition of the early monstrous forms. "And the C\·ening
and the morning were the sixth day." And here we must digress.
LA O.llF HER~<ETIQUE-SECTION I
Some students of the occult imagine (for certainly they are not properly
initiated and trained in the schools of occultism) that tlte missing link,
or first human form, the connccllon between the animal and human,
was caused by a spiritual impulse union, which, acllng upon the highest
form of animal, an ape, for example, produced an entirely different
species, quite human in their organism, but hairy, etc., and that
from this missing link the human race, as at present, has been evolved.
But this is erroneous, and void of truth. While the spirit atoms have
been evolving upward from the mineral, the spiritual form has been
involving downward until it became tangible and objective, possessing
at 6rst a vast but loosely organized body. Each age saw it smaller
and more compact, until, at tho end of the Third Race of the First
Human Round, the spiritual man had a compact, well-organized
body, and the commencement of the Fourth Race, (the center of
the seven) was the first point of contact, the focus of the spirit
downwards and the apex of the material upwards. (see note below)
Matter and spirit met and formed the first real physical man of
the human race. This is the great mystery;-thc lowest point in the
arc of spiritual involution impinges upon the highest nrc, or culmi-
nating point, of material evolution, and forms the origin of man.
The evolution of the remaining root races having taken place, the
lifo impulse begins to ebb and slowly quits our shores, and our Earth
for the first time enjoys a rest. The six days of creation ore at an
end, and the seventh is The Doy of Rest.
NOTE: This needs a little explnnatJon. The Rrst race of human bciniJ who existed
upon Lhls planet were really spiritual. Thelr bodies were quito ethereal, when
oompMcd with our gross orgnnbm,, but were sufficiently mntcrln1 to be objective
and tan~iblc. They were pure nnd innocent, true Adams nnd Eves, and their
country wn$ indeed a garden of Pamdise. They were natural bom adepts of the
highest order. They played with the Akasa nnd the magnetic currents of our
alobe as the boys to BuJwer Lytton's ''Coming Race.. pl3ycd with t.ho tTemmdous
Vril. The e1ementals and nature spirits were, by their nrt, rendered ob;ectivc,
and performed the duties of M"rvanlJ to thetn. This was the true Coldm Age. It
was the B.rst spiritual race ol human beings; the prOgenitors of humanity upon
our Earth. The r.tce wb;ch followed lhem was termed lhe su,.., Age in lhe

98 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
selfishness began to be engendered, and consequently there arose a school of
Black Magic. In this age the first elements of that curse, Caste, arose.
This, the Copper Age, was the last remnant of those who inherited the Divine
Wisdom of the Gods of the Golden Age. The spiritual races had now reached
the lowest possible point in the arc of spiritual involution, and the Fourth race,
or Iron Age people, were the first of the gross physical races, who became
mighty hunters, and ate flesh meat, and whose animal passions alone ruled their
enjoyments. From this date the nations became migratory nomads, and soon lost
all traces of that high civilization which belonged to the early Copper Age races.
This is, then, the esoteric explanation of the Four Ages of antiquity, and refers
only to the first round of mankind upon any newly created planet, and also to
the highest and two succeeding races previous to the life-wave leaving the
planet, viz., the three highest states possible in any given round. The others cycles
of years, termed Golden, Silver, etc., refer solely to polar motion and the change
of our Earth's climate.
The Day of Rest. The Sabbath of the Lord. The Earth slumbers
and enjoys the peace of Nirvana. After this Sabbath, the first day
of a new week commences, for the gaseous tide-wave, having gone
the circuit of the planetary chain, once more reaches our globe.
The atmosphere is again reorganized, purified, and galvanized with
new life to make it fit to receive and sustain a higher phase of
evolution. It breathes the breath of a .new life upon our awakening
planet. The life impulse that has been passive during the Sabbath
of the Lord becomes again active.
After the expiration of the gaseous wave, and another Polar
Day, the beds of the oceans have risen and become dry land, and
the old continents are now at the bottom of the ocean, and, as this
takes place slowly, the leading types of· flora, fauna and surviving
types of the seven human families retreat from the sinking continents
and occupy the new-made land and mountains which are waiting
to liberate their long-imprisoned spirit atoms, and this is affected,
directly the mineral wave arrives, at the commencement of the Second
Polar Day. The old mineral elements are now liberated, and the
incoming mineral wave becomes incarnated in their place. By the
time this tide has attained its climax the newly liberated spirit atoms
of this planet form a new mineral wave, which, seeking reincarnation,
begins to How on to the next planet, which has already been prepared
for it by the preceding gaseous wave. Then, in succession, comes
the vegatable, animal, etc., to prepare a "New Heaven and a New
Earth" for the incoming life-wave that shall evolve the Second
Round of humanity, which, having again evolved its seven root races
and their innumerable sub and offshoot races, again passes on its
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECTION I 99
journey round the chain, leaving only a remnant of its seven leading
types to survive the long ages of slumber, to give the struggling
monads that Nature has left behind a chance of incarnating them-
selves to form the connecting links for the next round. And so does
evolution proceed until each planet of the chain has evolved seven
complete rounds of humanity, and then the Great Jubilee of the
Earth takes place. Seven times 7 rounds equal 49; and 7 races of
human beings on 7 planets is also 49; and the 50th. is the year of
Jubilee, symbolized by the Jews every 50th. year, when no work
was done and the land rested. "As it is below, so it is above, as on
the earth, so in the sky." Remember this.
And now, as a conclusion to this part of La Clef Hermetique,
we give the Cycles and Periods in full, tabulated, so as to enable
the student to comprehend them at a glance. It only remains to
say that at the end of every Great Period, of 1,016,064,000 years,
the Sun of our system passes into a passive state of sleep, and remains
so for 127,008,000 years. It is, in fact, the Solar Nirvana (just as the
Earth enters Nirvana at the end of every complete evolution). All
the planetary chains of the solar system are disintegrated during
the great solar Nirvana, and recreated upon the awakening of
our Sun from its cycle of rest. The alternate states of activity and rest
are by the Hindoo Initiates termed the days and nights of Brahma.
THE CYCLE PERIODS OF THE GREAT LIFE-WAVE
OF MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION
One Polar Day, which is also the cycle of duration of any
life-wave on our planet, is, when measured by the common years
of our Earth's time, exactly 2,592,000 years.
And, although the 7 planets of our chain vary in the length
of their respective life-waves, some a few thousand years more and
some a few thousand less, they are, on the average, all of the same
duration. Hence the great period of the life-wave, traveling once
round our septenary chain of worlds, is 2,592,000 multiplied by 7,
or 18,144,000 years. This is for the complete circuit of 7 orbs, but
the cycle, or period, of the life-wave, from its leaving the Earth to
its reappearance or commencement is 2,592,000 less than the above,
or, in other words, exactly 15,552,000 years.
100 TUE l.ICIIT OP ECYPT
The period of evolution of the 7 great rounds of humanity, and
producing 7 times 7, e<Jlmling '19, root races of immortal beings (for
each race contains its own immortals), is the period of the life-wave
passing seven times round the chain, or 127,008,000 years.
There are now say sevun great 11lanetnry families. each family
containing within ibcl£ seven root races, and each root nace con·
taining within itself, its numerous offshoot races. The perfected
humanity, then, rests in the enjoyment of a blissful Nirvana, or -rhe
pence of Cod, which p:uscth all understanding," for the 50th Period,
that is to say, the 7 planetary families of our E"rth h"ve occupied
i complete circuits of the life-wave round the chain, or ~9 Polar
Days. The 50th day is the day when those purified souls enter
:-lirvana, as a family, and this :\irvana lasts until the human life-wave
has passed round the chain in a passive state and reached the shores
of our planet again, or 18,144,000 years.
After the Jubilee of Nin•ann, this vast, and now e.<>lted, bost
of the 7 planetary families' perfected souls bc<.-ome, in their turn,
the originators and guao·dinns of a new and fresh rnce of humanity,
eAch planclnry fomily, ot stnto, becoming tho cspcci2-l rulers of
their own sphere, while their own late Angelic Guardians, the 7
spirits (familie.' of spil"its) that stand b<·forc the l.ord, termed Ohyan
Chohans in Esoteric Buddhism, nsccml still higher into more perfect
spheres of co
·eation. You will take note that each family, or new angelic
planetary state of lately exalted h11mnn souls, rules the corrcspoo1ding
family upon Eno·th. Thus tho A
rst family, or that which formed
the first 7 root races after their cycle, rules the 6rst seven root races
of their new creAtion, and so on with the others. These new races
of hurnnn beings evolve and pass through the s:1mc hannonious
process of evolution, from spirit to matter and back again to spirit,
thus completing the great cycle of necessity. The plnnet itself is
not recreated after each earthly Nirvano, but re-awakened into
activity and life to pass through 7 times 7 races, or circuits of the
life wave, or 127,008.000 years.
After the period has agnin expired, this race of guardians also
ascend to higher planes. and the second planetary family enjoys
Nirvan.a for 18,144.000 years, and then in their turn become guardians
of the third's 7 families (termed one planetary family}. Then the
third family originate, rule and guard the fourth, the fourth the
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECTION I 101
fifth, and so on until our Earth (and the planetary chain in its
tum) has evolved 7 great planetary families, each family consisting
of 7 rounds, and each round of 7 root races, and has also enjoyed
7 Nirvanas. This makes up the grand period of 8 times 127,008,000
years, which, in its grand and complete total, equals 1,016,064,000
years of earthly time.
This period is obtained as follows; 7 periods of 127,008,000 for
the 7 great planetary families, and 7 Nirvanas of 18,144,000, which
make the eighth; the total eighth. This great cycle, 1,016,064,000 years,
is the exact term of our planet's physical existence.
The 7 great cycles and the 7 Nirvanas together constitute the
eighth, and produce the sleep of death. Our sphere will then have
completed the period of child-bearing; old age has gradually settled
upon her; she has borne seven sons, and now sinks into the eighth
period-sleep-the sleep of death and complete annihilation. Cohesion
loosens its hold upon the molecules, and atom by atom the planet's
particles are disintegrated and dispersed in space. The great solar
sleep, or Nirvana, takes place, and our Sun ceases to be active for
a period of 127,008,000 years, viz., a complete evolutionary cycle;
and it is only when the first warm breath of new spiritual life
pulsates through the spaces of Aeth that a recreation of the planetary
chains commences anew. The disintegrated atoms of former worlds
are reconstructed with new cosmic matter, and once more evolution;
but upon a higher plane; begins its almost ceaseless round.
Note the terrible significance of the figure 8. The eighth sphere
of our chain is not a visible orb, but a lifeless, dark, semi-spiritual
one. (see note below) It is the sphere of death, and the temporary
abode of those souls, or shades, who have, through their depraved
lives, lost their connection with the Divine Parent, the spiritual ego
that gave them birth. Yet they have bartered a glorious, divine
birthright for a mess of pottage, and now must sink unconsciously
into the sleep of oblivion, while the enfranchised souls of their
nobler brethren are urging their resistless course through the sapphire
vaults and starlit realms of the Milky Way. And yet, 0 most esteemed
and eternal brother, in the face of our eternal progress, these vast
Cycles and most awful, incomprehensible Periods are but a few
fast-fleeting moments of planetary existence. The whole eras of
102 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
past eternity cannot bring one second more near the end of our
immortal, deathless reign.
NoTE: This eighth orb is known to Initiates of the highest interior degree as "the
Dark Satellite," whose ruling spiritual hierophant is known by the name of Ob.
From this name came that of Oberon and so evil and infernal is the power of this
sphere that all cases of demonia, enchantment or possession came to be termed
Obsession. The buried cities of the Gobi desert belong to races who were the
devotees of this Ob. (This was after the Gobi had become a portion of the
continent of old India and does not refer to the "Golden isle" of the sea, when
the Gobi was a tropical ocean.) Hence its name, Gobi, that is, the followers of
Ob, or the country of Ob. This is the reason for the awful traditions mentioned
in "Isis Unveiled" as to the hidden treasures being guarded by a legion of infernal
spirits. It is from this evil orb that the powers possessed by the Black Magi are
derived, and, in fact, it is the Spiritual correspondence of those brothers on Earth.
For, remember, there is not a class of people, or a society devoted to any subject
on Earth, but what has a spiritual correspondence in the realm of spirit. The
Hermetic Law is one grand truth, viz., "As it is above, so it is below, as on the
Earth, so in the Sky." St. Paul mentions, or rather refers, to this "Dark Satellite"

THE SACRED CYCLES AND NUMBERS OF THE ANCIENT IDNDOOS
" 'Tis but a moment from its first
evolution to its bier and shroud;
Then, 0 why should the spirit
of mortal be proud?"
It would be a waste of time upon our part, and a greater waste
of the time of the student of esoteric science, if we were to wade through
and enumerate the whole system of these sacred cycles and numbers,
or were he to attempt the task of remembering them. We shall supply
the key to these numbers. This sacred mystical key will fit every
cyclic lock, and only requires to be turned with a wise hand to
enable the student to open every portal in the Oriental system of
numbers.
The Five Great Yugas
Satya Yug 1,728,000 years, 4periods, units equal18 and 9
Treta Yug 1,296,000 years, 3 periods, units equal18 and 9
Dvapara Yug 864,000 years, 2 periods, units equal18 and 9
Cali Yug 432,000 years, 1 period, units equal 9
Maha Yug 4,320,000 years, 10periods, units equal 9
If the student goes over the above numbers, he will notice that
they are all parts of the Divine Age, the Maha Yug, and that each
is composed of the Cali Yug. For instance, Satya Yug, or 4 periods,
is 'just 4 Cali Yugs, and so on; and the Cali Yug is the period of the
Earth's Pole passing over 60 degrees of its orbit, and thus forming
the sextile to its own true place. The Dvapara Yug is the period of
the Earth's Pole forming the trine aspect to its true place, and passing
over 120 degrees of its orbit. The Treta Yug is the period of the
Earth's Pole passing over 180 degrees of its orbit, and forming the
opposition to its own place. It is the Cycle that rules the day and
104 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
the night, the evening and the morning of one Polar Day of Creation.
The Satya Yug is the period of the Earth's Pole passing over 240
degrees of its orbit. It is the double trine, or twice 120 degrees.
(see note below) It is also the Cycle that rules the great turning
point of the life-wave of the planetary chain; that is, when the
Earth has passed through a Satya Yug, the culminating point has
been passed, and the life impulse begins to pass to the next planet.
Again, you must observe the regular, harmonious progression of
the terminating units of each Yug, 2, 4, 6, 8, and of the periods
(Cali Yugs), 1, 2, 3, 4. These are the locks, and each one points
esoterically to the mysterious, hidden number so carefully veiled from
the rude gaze of the profane mind. This sacred, guarded number
constitutes the Golden Key. It is the magical 9, the highest unit. It
is a triune, or three times three, equal 333 (3 times 3 equals 9); this is
360, less 3 times 9, equals 27 degrees, and in its second aspect shows
the magical number of Abracadabra, or 666 (18 equals 9). This
sacred number is the perfect symbol of Deity. Multiply it as you
like by any number and it resolves itself into 9; and just as all the
different aspects of the Eternal and Divine Essence eventually return
into the one primordial source, so does this number. No matter to
what power it is raised, its ultimate is 9. Hence it is the Divine Figure
that can alone unlock the Cycles of the Great First Cause.
NoTE: The Pole passing over 60 degrees of its orbit is, in the occult, symbolized
by the Sun within a six-pointed star; or Draco, the Serpent, enfolding a six-
pointed star in its coils. The trine aspect is likewise a trine, but also as a three-
pointed star· i.e., having three rays.
The Poie in opposition, or passing 180 degrees, is in one. of the aspects of
the eight-pointed star, in which each ray is opposite another. The period of 240
degrees polar motion is symbolized by the Sun being enclosed in Solomon's Seal
or the double trine, viz., 120 degrees added to 120 degrees is 240 degrees.
Having explained the preliminary details of the Hindoo system,
we must now enter upon a more beautiful series of calculations of
esoteric cycles; and it is necessary, in order to comprehend this, to
reveal the Secret Period of the Hindoos, termed a Divine Year. This
Divine Year consists of exactly 360 (9) common years, or the number of
degrees in the Zodiac. With this year the ancients used to veil their
more treasured Cycles.
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECriON II 105
We will now compare, side by side, the Five Great Yugas, with
their esoteric periods when expressed by Divine Years;
Satya Yug
Treta Yug
Dvapara Yug
Cali Yug
Maha Yug
Common Divine
Years Years
1,728,000, equal 4 periods, equal 4,800
1,296,000, equal 3 periods, equal 3,600
864,000, equal 2 periods, equal 2,400
432,000, equal 1 period, equals 1,200
4,320,000, equal10 periods, equal12,000
In the first place, we see that the Divine Maha Yug is composed
of 12,000 Divine Years, which constitute the 10 Great Ages, (see note
below) or Cali Yugs, and, in the second, place, that the Divine Years
run thus; 4, 3, 2, 1 and 8, 6, 4, 2, and taken by themselves are 1,200
or 1 and 2 equal 3; and 2,400 or 2 and 4 equal 6; and 3,600 or 3 and
6 equal 9; and lastly, 4,800 or 4 and 8 equal 12; which are briefly
3, 6, 9, 12. We explain all these simple matters to show that all the
sacred numbers of the Hindoos are one complete and harmonious
progression of the 9 units. The student may, if he chooses, go into
the Manwatares and Yugs at his leisure and as his inclination prompts.
The Manwatares are portions of the Great Kalpa, which is 1,000
Maha Yugs of 4,320,000 common years. This is almost too much
for human comprehension, and so we leave it, retiring content with
the knowledge that it was but a method adopted by the ancient
sages to express their ideas of the sublime majesty of Aum, and to
show the utter fallacy of the finite ever being able to comprehend
· the Infinite, Divine, First Cause or the extent of His attributes.
NoTE: The Ten Ages, or Cali Yugs, are also, in the East, shown under the
symbol of the Ten Avaters; the Goddess Cali, of the old Hindoos, being a kind of
geological Isis, or Queen of geological formations. And lastly, while the whole
of this is strictly true, so far as this; the physical or material plane is concerned;
yet it must, by the laws of correspondence, be considered in its truly occult sense.
The four ages are the four Great Cycles of human evolution; First, the Golden,
the classical, Satumian age; then the less spiritual or Silver Age; then the Cop-
per; and lastly the Iron Age; the dense or material barbarian age or state, spirit
in its descent, becoming more and more gross, until the lowest point of the age
of Earth, or the Iron Age, was reached, and man· entered upon the first human
cycle. This, of course, teaches that our first progenitors were truly spiritual, or
angelic, and that each age in the scale of involution made them more material;
and directly the lowest point of the arc was reached, then material evolution
commenced. But, of course, all these spiritual verities will open out to your
mind as you carefully think over this brief paper.
106 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
We will now turn from the theoretical to the practical Cycles
of the old Hindoos and esoterically explain
THE FOUR CELEBRATED AGES OF ANTIQUITY
In the first place, we have taught that the Hindoos' esoteric, or
Divine, year consisted of 360 common years, and that the whole of
their cycles bear a direct relation to arithmetical progression and
proportion, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4, 3, 2, 1; also 2, 4, 6, 8 etc. We
have thoroughly explained Polar Motion, etc., therefore, if we calculate
the motion of the North Pole from the period of its being perpendicular
to, and coinciding with, the North Pole of the Ecliptic, over a distance
of 90 degrees, when it would be horizontal, or in the plane of its
orbit, we shall obtain four distinct periods, bearing the mystical
relation of 4, 3, 2; 1, which will be found to have a remarkable
character in the country round Benares, or latitude 27 degrees North
(2 and 7 equal 9). Benares is the ancient seat of learning in India,
and at one time was the center of their occult schools; but their
sacred place, or temple of observation, was termed the Mountain
of Light in latitude 27 degrees. By using the Divine Year as a Key,
we find the meaning of the following period$ or ages;
Golden Age
Silver Age
Copper Age
Iron.Age
Common Polar Divine
Years Motion Years
259,200, 4 times 9 equals 36 degrees and 720
194,400, 3 times 9 equals 27 degrees and 540
129,600, 2 times 9 equals 18 degrees and 360
' 64,800, 1 times 9 equals 9 degrees and 180
648,000, 10 times9equals 90 degrees and 1,800
Thus, during the passage of the Pole from one point of the quad-
rant to the other, occurred the mystical ages, which also correspond
to fire, air, water and earth. These Periods will be found to differ by
64,800 years, or 180 Divine Years, from one another~ and each
portion of the ·angle moved over consists of the mysterious number
9, multiplied by 4, 3, 2, 1; thus, 4 times 9 degrees equals 36 degrees;
3 times 9 degrees equals 27 degrees; 2 times 9 degrees equals 18
degrees; and 1 times 9 degrees equals 9 degrees; and bearing in
mind that our place of observation is Benares, or 27 degrees North
latitude, we find that during 720 Divine Years the Tropics passed
from the equator to 36 degrees latitude, North and South; and from
LA CLEF HERMETIQUE-SECTION II 107
this point during 540 more the Tropics passed up to 63 degrees
latitude, North and South; and also from this position, during a
further 360 Divine Years, it reached up to 81 degrees North latitude;
and lastly, during a period of 180 Divine Years from this era, the
Tropics reached the Pole, when every portion of the globe had a
Tropical summer and an Arctic winter. But, to better express our
meaning, we will briefly describe these four ages.
The first is the Golden Age, which began with a most delightful
climate, a gentle, fruitful, universal summer. This ancient seat of
science was indeed divinely favored by the laws of Nature throughout
long ages, and no wonder it was christened the Golden Age, which
corresponds to Fire. But the Poles gradually moved on, though at no
time during this age was the meridian altitude of the Sun, on the
shortest day, less than 27 degrees; the latitude of the observatory.
Then came the Silver Age, which corresponds to the element of
Air. This periud lasted for 540 Divine Years, and was a variable
period. The summers were hot and the days long; the winters were
cold and the days short, but the Sun was always visible above the
horizon at noon on the shortest day, and the Tropics reached an
angle of 63 degrees.
Next in rotation we have the Copper Age, corresponding to the
element of Water, which lasted for 360 Divine Years. It was indeed
a dull, watery, lifeless period. A Tropical summer and an Arctic
winter, the spring deluging the plains and lowlands with frightful floods,
etc. The Tropics moved another 18 degrees nearer the Pole, and on
the shortest day at noon the Sun never rose, but was 18 degrees
below the horizon. As, however, 18 degrees is within the angle of
twilight, they had no absolute darkness.
Lastly comes the Iron Age, corresponding to the Earth; the Age
of Horror, which lasted 180 Divine Years, and at noon on the shortest
day the Sun was 27 degrees below the horizon, and never rose for
weeks together in midwinter. It was cold, dark, frozen and death-like,
and a period when the extremes of heat and cold waged incessant
war, neither obtaining the victory.
In closing this chapter, we will reproduce, for notice, that the
Pole passed over 90 degrees, or one-fourth of the circle, in 1,800
Divine Years, or 648,000 common years. Therefore, it passed its
complete orbit of 360 degrees in 7,200 Divine Years, or 2,592,000
108 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
common years, from which take the Prajanatha Yug of 2,160,000
common years, and the remainder is the Cali Yug of 432,000 common
years, or the Age of Heat. The Cali Yug is one-sixth of the polar orbit,
and five Cali Yugs make the Prajanatha Yug.
The 70 Elders initiated by Moses and Aaron were symbolical
of the 72 Divine Years; that is, 70 Elders and Moses and Aaron,
making the total 72, or the magic 9; which is the period of the Sun
passing the 12 signs of the Zodiac, or 25,920 years. It states in the
Holy Writ that they (the 70 Elders and Moses and Aaron) saw the
God of Israel, which, of course, was the Sun; and the 72 Elders
represented its Great Cycle, or 72 times 360 common years equals
25,920 years.

CHAPTER VI
LA CLEF
A Key to the Work of Abbot Trithemius, entitled-
•· "The Secondaries, or Ruling Intelligences Who,
After God, Actuate the Universe."
The periods of the ruling Principles, or Intelligences, and their
order of succession in the government of the world is incorrectly
stated by tl1e Abbot Trithemius, although there is every reason to be-
lieve that this wise and truly learned Abbot knew perfectly well what
the true period and order of succession was.
And it was doubtless from reasons of policy that he thought well
to conceal this knowledge from the ignorant and profane; knowing,
as he must have done, that all worthy and accepted Neophytes would
be taught the actual truth during the process of their Initiation.
The correct Cycle, or Period, during which each of the Seven In-
telligences has chief rule over all worldly concerns, is an 84th. part
of the Great Solar Period of 25,920 years, or a seventh part of the
Sub-Solar Period of 2,160 years, and is equal to about 308 years and
208l!z days. It will be seen that as the Sun's period, or Revolution,
round his immense orbit is 25,920 years, he moves or passes through
one Zodiacal Sign in exactly 2,160 years, and that a seventh part of
this gives each of the Seven Principles one term of power in each of
the 12 signs; and in one complete period of 25,920 years each of the
Seven Intelligences has 12 times been the chief governor of this
sublunary sphere.
The correct order, or rotation of succession, is the natural order
of planetary application; thus, in the first order of the Seven Governors,
Cassie}, (see note below) the Angel or Intelligence of Saturn, receives
power, and after ruling the world for 308 years, 208lh days, resigns
the reins of government to Zachariel, the Angel of Jupiter, who stands
second in the order of the Ruling Powers, and after another term of
308 years, 208lh days, hands over the control of the world to Samael,
the Angel of Mars, who for the same period subjects the world and
its inhabitants to the influence of Martial force; then in the fourth
order of the Seven Governors comes the Archangel Michael, the
center, and also the chief, of the Seven Great Principles, who, having

ruled the world for 308 years, 208¥2 days, retires in favor of the next suc-
cession, and fifth in the order, whose name is Anael, Prince of the
Astral Light and Chief Angel of the planet Venus, who, after ruling
the world for 308 years, 208¥z days, retires in favor of Raphael, who re-
ceives the scepter of earthly rule. Bright Raphael, the swift messenger
of the Gods, and presiding Intelligence of the planet Mercury, rules
for 308 years, 208¥2 days, when Gabriel, the negative, receives the
Ruling Powers. This Intelligence, who is the Angel of the Moon, gov-
erns the Earth for 308 years, 208¥z days, is the Seventh, and last, of the
order and this completes the Sub-Solar Cycle of 2,160 years, when
Cassiel once more takes command, and so on, Cycle after Cycle,
"ad infinitum."
NoTE: Cassiel is the usual name given to the Saturnine principle. The Abbot
Trithemius calls it Orifiel, as do several other writers. Hence, it is well to note, that
many names are used Kabbalistically; each name expressing the nature, or qualities,
symbolically, by the different Hebrew characters of which it is composed, each
different name belonging to the same state or intelligence; denoting different
aspects of its power or influence. All the active Principles, or positive angelic
Intelligences, as a rule terminate with El, while the negative or evil powers
terminate with On; one is solar, the other is lunar. This hint will be sufficient for
the student of the Occult, who must ever remember that he must not measure
good and evil by any modem conception of these terms.
Every power of Nature, whether it be an intelligent, or a non-intelligent power,
is ever striving to obtain an equilibrium; that which we call evil is but a more
intense expression of that which we call good; for instance, Pride, Love, Ambition,
love of Self and Combativeness, are good, when combined in their true proportion,
and any human being without any one of these, would be imperfect; but, carry one
or two of these, otherwise good qualities, to a great extreme, and we should witness
the greatest evil results. Then remember the Hermetic Law; "As it is below, so it
is above, as on the Earth, so in the sky."
A brief glance into past History will be instructive to the student
of Psychology, and to enable him to do this, and assist his researches,
we supply the following correct data terminating a Sub-Solar Cycle
with Michael receiving the Government of the world in the begin·
ning of the year 1881, (see note below) when the sub-races of the
West reach the Equator of Human progress, and carrying our re-
searches forward from this date up to the culminating point of the
arc; from which point Western Races descend the descending Cycle,
and once more relapse into ignorance.
NoTE: The student must bear in mind that there are three different kinds of Cycles
spoken of in La Clef. The first are Solar Cycles. Thus, 25,920 years form the Great
Solar Cycle, and is the period of the Sun passing through the twelve signs of the
Zodiac, and, consequently, completing one revolution of his orbit, round his

In carrying our investigations into chc past nges. it will suffice ir
we begin in the year B.C. 1200, when Ctusicl, the Angel or Saturn.
resumed the Government of the world.
From the year B.C. 1200 to the yen•
· B.C. 897. the earth was
under the melancholy inRucnce or Cnssicl's Rule; and in the very
LA CLEF 113
first year of his reign, Troy, the famous Trojan City was taken and
destroyed by the Greeks, and many other events faithfully indicate
the nature and power of Saturine influence. It will well repay those
who will study Ancient History.
After Cassiel, the benevolent Zachariel, Chief Agent of Jupiter,
became Regent of the world, and here we note the remarkable dif-
ference between the two Governors. In the beginning of this Angel's
reign, Rome, the Mistress of the world, was built, and the foundation
of a mighty Empire substantially laid. All Nations began to progress
rapidly int9 a more advanced state of civilization, and to cultivate
the Arts and Sciences, and lastly, but by no means the least of the
benefits conferred by Zachariel, was the production, toward the
close of his reign, of two of the most extraordinary men our era has
ever seen, viz., Gautama Buddha in India and Pythagoras in Europe.
The Angel Zachariel, was in power from the year B.C. 897 to the
year B.C. 588. Then came Samael, the Angel of Mars, who reigned
from the year B.C. 588 to the year B.C. 280. Thi!f period is one of
war, Martial Heroes and brilliant achievements on the field of battle.
A glance at the history of Greece and Rome will suffice to show how
true this is.
After Samael, came Michael, the Sun God, the shining chief of
the Seven Intelligences, and ruled the world from the yE!Ilr B.C. 280
to the year A.D. 29. During this period most Nations attained the
Climax of power and civilization. Toward the close of his reign, this
bright Angel presented the Nations of the West with a teacher, who
rivaled, in moral teachings and excelled in practical benevolence,
Gautama Buddha, the greatest moral reformer the East has ever
seen. This Teacher was styled by His followers, the Son of God, and
was called by name Jesus, the son of Joseph and Mary.
He was called the Son of God Astrologically, because He was
born into the world during the reign of Michael, the Sun God. And
esoterically because he was at-one with the Universal Father.
And it is remarkably strange, that, no sooner did Michael's Rule
end, than the numerous priestly enemies of this noble reformer be-
came triumphant, and brutally murdered Him, as they have done
thousands of others in all ages of the world.
The great religious symbol of all exoteric religious systems and
dogmatic sacerdotal castes has been the Cross; inverted, it is a
114 THE LIGIIT OF EGYPT
bloody weapon, the sword, and past history can prove how well its
devoted priesthood knew its fearful use.
After Michael comes Anael, "Prince of the Astral Light," the
Angel of Venus and Love, who ruled from the year A.D. 29 to the
year A.D. 337. These were the days of religious persecution; the
days, also, of faith and love among the Christians for the doctrine of
their noble Chief. It was in these days when it was said, "How these
Christians love one another;" but, alas, it was also a time of great
licentiousness in Rome, when women, love, lust and debauchery were
the order of the day. This period will show the occult student the
two opposite powers or forces of Anael's influence. When exerted for
evil, it is all that is obscene and disgusting, but, when exerted for
good, it evolves that which is noble, elegant and true.
After Anaers rule terminated, the Angel of Mercury, or Raphael,
commenced to rule, and was Governor from the year A.D. 337 to the
year A.D. 646. It was during this period that the Gospels of the
New Testament were forged. Christianity, under the rule of the
Brain instead of simple faith and brotherly love, became proud.
From being persecuted, she became the persecutor. The church be-
came dogmatic, cunning, and thoroughly determined to succeed at
all hazards. The most transparent forgeries were accepted as abso-
lute truth. The mutilation of the works of the contemporary authors
of the Apostles and the earliest Christian Fathers, and interpolating
suitable passages of their own, were considered meritorious actions.
It was during this reign that the celebrated Council of Nice was
held, and the divinity of Jesus established-by vote.
At the end of the year A.D. 646 Gabriel, the Angel of the Moon,
became the Supreme Ruler, and reigned until the year A.D. 954.
This period, like all Lunar periods, was one of intellectual slumber.
The Dark Ages had set in, and gradually increased until Cassiel, the
Angel of Saturn, took command, and goverened from the year A.D.
954 to the year A.D. 1263, and made things worse.
Pagan darkness and gross superstitution held the sway, and
reigned supreme, until the year A.D. 1263. The lowest point in the
mental arc was reached, and Western nations were in the most dense
condition. But a change was at hand, for the benevolent Zachariel,
the genius of Jupiter, again resumed the management of the world,
and reigned until the year A.D. 1572. This period is one of almost un-
LA CLEF 115
interrupted intellectual progress. During this Rule of Power, the
despotic power of Rome received its death-blow.
Parliaments were instituted for the people, the days of Good
Queen Bess came to an end. Protestantism flourished, and so pre-
pared the way for Free Thought.
After the good reign of Zachariel, Samael, the Angel of Mars,
came into power and reigned from the year A.D. 1572 to the year A.D.
1880 (until December 21st. 1880, when the Sun reached the Tropic of
Capricorn. Michael began to reign on December 23rd.) This rule
was the Age of Iron, and just as Rome conquered all before her over
2,000 years before, and achieved imperial greatness, so did Great
Britain, the second Rome. It was again a period of war, mechanical
inventions and martial glory, and, at times, the whole of Europe was
one great battlefield, and resounded with the din of arms "and all the
circumstances of war." In the future this will be called the age of
war-like inventions, and noted for its huge ironclads, great guns,
and other fearful engines of destruction.
Mars rules iron and all martial arts and sciences; hence the won-
derful inventions of this age-period in steam engines, iron ships and
elaborate machinery.
At the end of the year A.D. 1880, the Great Archangel Michael
comes into power and once more has the government of the world
until the year A.D. 2188. This will be a period of Imperial Greatness.
Empires will shine full of glory, the Human intellect will have full
play and all ChurcMs, Religious Creeds and Ecclesiastical Dogmas
will fall to the ground and become things of the past. Parsons, Vicars
and Bishops will have to work in different fields if they mean to ob-
tain an honest livelihood. Yes, I repeat this prophecy. The Churches
and Chapels will fall with a terrible crash, and be destroyed. But
from their ashes, Phoenix-like, shall arise a new Religion, whose
shining Motto will be; Veritas Excelsior, Truth Above. This era shall
proclaim the rights of man. It is essentially the age of reason dreamed
of by Bruno and Thomas Paine. During the reign of this Angelic In-
telligence, the Masculine Element will receive the Solar influx and
obtain its highest development. Intellect and Reason will remove
most of our Social disorders and women receive more attention in
worldly affairs; but at the same time, it is not a feminine period
by any means.
116 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
Mankind under this rule, will become physically and intellec-
tually immensely superior to what they are now. Startling discoveries
in Chemistry, Electricity and all the physical sciences will be brought
to light. Steam will be superseded by Compressed Air (gas), Electro-
Magnetism (atomic power) as a motive power. In fact a new era of
progress will dawn upon the world, as time and space will be an-
nihilated by new transportation and communication; and, last, but not
least, Science and Religion will become blended, spiritual intercourse
an acknowledged fact, and Psychology the special study of the great-
est Scientists of the day.
After the rule of Michael, Anael, Prince of the Astral Light, will
receive the Guardianship of the world, and reign from the year A.D.
2188 to the year A.D. 2497. This is the feminine period, and woman
will, during Anael's reign, become man's just and lawful equal, so-
cially and politically. Intuition will show itself the superior of mere
intellect, and the human form, physically, attain its greatest degree of
perfection. Occultism will be taught in our Universities, Astronomers
become Astrologers, and drugs for the treatment of disease be con-
signed to the limbo of oblivion, to keep company with the Religious
Dogmas and Scientific Noodleisms of today. It is at this point that I
would warn all Western Nations. Remember that this is the period
of feminine force and love. Therefore, see to it that you form not
those magnetic conditions that would attract into your midst the
dark legionaries of Anael. If you do, Woe be unto you; as pride and
luxury, licentiousness and debauchery will result, and the fate of
Nineveh, Babylon and Rome will be yours; but if, on the other hand,
virtue, morality and pure affectional love, stand paramount amongst
you; then, all that is noble, elegant and true shall reign in. your midst.
Then shall Nations abolish fleets and standing armies, kings lay aside
their scepters, and a Universal Human Brotherhood begin to compre-
hend their common origin and Divine relationship with the GREAT
FIRST CAUSE.
After Anael, in the order of the seven Governors, Raphael will
receive the Scepter of earthly rule-Bright Raphael, the swift mes-
senger of the gods and presiding Intelligence of the Planet Mercury.
This will be the grand era of the mind, the age of the Genius of Hu-
manity, to assimilate all the stores of knowledge, treasured up by the
past ages. This is the culminating point (see note below) of this sub-
LA CLEF 117
cycle of the sub-Western races. Raphael will govern from the year
A.D. 2497 to the year A.D. 2806. During this period, the attainment
of Adeptship will be the highest ambition of the noblest minds, though
but few will attain unto this ideal height in any race of the present
round. Science and the Arts will attain unto a degree of perfection
unknown to any past age, and thus will close the Intellectual genius
of the Western Race.
From the summit we begin to retrograde, for Gabriel, the sev-
enth Governor, now takes up the reins of power, and rules from the
year A.D. 2806 to the year A.D. 3114. This rule is again the stagna-
tion of mind, and once more Humanity having attained the greatest
height possible in this cycle, begins to travel on the downward arc
and the nations again relapse gradually into ignorance, and spiritual
truth will materialize itself into concrete sacerdotalism, nor will man-
kind of the West again reach its climax of civilization until about the
year A.D. 7300.
NoTE: The culminating point of this Cycle is about the year A.D. 2800, or six years
before the expiration of Raphael's Rule. The Sub-Western Races, then at their
climax of development, will gradually decline, while certain other races of the
West will be rapidly rising on their ascending arc, as will the nations of the Orient,
who will culminate about the time of the Sub-Western Races reaching the lowest
arc of the Cycle.

EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR CHAPTERS V AND VI
Throughout La Clef Hermetique and La Clef the terms, Powers,
Intelligences, and Principles, have been used in a somewhat confused
way. Hence, it is necessary to explain, that, when speaking of the
seven Ruling Intelligences, the terms, Intelligences, Powers, and
Principles are to be understood as meaning the same thing, each
Angel being a Principle possessing both Power and Intelligence. But,
when speaking in reference to Humanity, as follows in this note, the
terms, Principle, Power and Force, are to be understood as referring
to the attributes of the Human Soul.
By Feminine Powers or Principles, we mean the passive, recep-
tive, intuitional qualities; and when speaking of the Masculine or
Feminine Forces ruling in the world, as the case of Anael or Michael,
we mean that the prevailing influence of the period is such as to
evolve these qualities in the Races under its influence.
118 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
Students of the Occult will know that these seven Angels, exoter-
ically called Cassie!, Zachariel, Samael, etc., are not single individual or
Angelic or Spiritual Intelligences, but Angelic States, each state com-
prising innumerable hosts of purified Angelic Beings. The reason why
these seven states are termed the Seven Planetary Angels, is, because
their special force or power in its effects upon the earth's inhabitants,
corresponds magnetically with the force exerted by the Seven Principle
or Primary Planets whose names they bear; each state named after its
corresponding Planetary Nature.
These Seven ruling Principles in their combined total constitute
ONE RAY of the PRIMAL ESSENCE; and it is this ESSENCE whom
we call GOD, just as the seven varied tints in the rays of the Solar
Spectrum, constitute the pure white Light of the Glorious Sun.
There is, at the present day, a certain sect of Esoteric Christians,
or more properly students of Esoteric Christianity, who have very
mistaken ideas and opinions of what they call the new era, or the
reign of Michael, which commenced A.D. 1881. Without in the least
wishing to disparage the efforts of the students who are working with
what light they possess, in the cause of Truth, we must warn the
student of Occult Science against these erroneous theories, and say
at once, that the Grand Galleries of the Great Pyramid have nothing
whatever to do with "Anno Domini," 1881. These Esoteric Christians
are in possession of a certain book entitled "The Perfect Way," or the
"Finding of Christ." Against this work we have not one single word to
say, because it contains a vast amount of truth, but, like all works
upon the Occult, the truths are hidden from the unitiated. Failing to
perceive this fundamental fact, and taking the literal point of view, a
vast -number of Esoteric Christians, who completely misunderstand
the sublime truths contained in the book, joyfully imagine and pro-
claim to the public that this new Era begins the Love Element and
the Feminine Forces of Nature; and Woman shall become triumphant
during this era. That they are grossly in error "La Clef" will show.
They further proclaim that "Woman" shall become the grand central
figure of Humanity, the sublime Intuition of the Age. How these ex-
ponents of Esoteric Christianity can reconcile this theory, we cannot
understand. The feminine can never rule the masculine. As well
say the positive can be controlled by the negative, or a passive resist
an active force. Woman is in possession of a major portion of the
LA CLEF 119
Intuitional, or feminine principles or powers, and only a minor por-
tion of the masculine. Man is just the reverse. Hence it will be seen
that both sexes possess both qualities. When a race of Human beings
is dominated chiefly by the feminine principle, as in most of the
Oriental races of Humanity on every Planet, during the descent of
spirit into matter, the people are by far the most spiritual, but at the
same time they are vastly more dreamy, impracticable and simple, than
they would be if governed by the masculine force chiefly. Hence it is
that Humanity requires to undergo material incarnation; not to de-
velop the feminine, but to evolve the masculine attributes of the Hu-
man Soul, and thus round out the positive individuality that will
enable the perfected Monad to say I Am. Again, many of the Esoteric
Christians are possessed with a species of prophetic mania, and al-
most go into hysterics of enthusiasm when they contemplate what
they allegorically term the second coming of the Lord, i.e., the era of
Michael, the Sun God, which, as they are well aware, commences in
1881. This class of Esoteric Christians triumphantly point to the
Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid, as indicating, by means of the
Pyramidal inch, this Era, but, unfortunately for these individuals, the
whole of their Esoteric Cycles, and a great part of their teachings, are
not based upon the immutable laws of Nature, but upon the unsatis-
factory foundation of mere assumption. To begin with, they assert
that the index measurements of the Galleries of the Great Pyramid, con-
sisting of 628, 1542, and 1881, point out certain periods of early Jew-
ish. and later Christian history, and include the date, or time it was
built, up to the present day, or A.D. 1881. These assertions, for they
are nothing else, have no foundation in truth, and consequently are
not worth the paper they are written on. This theory really amounts
to saying that this grand monument of Ancient Egypt was built for
the special purpose of recording the prophetical data of a nation of
Israelitish Brigands, culminating with a Saviour sent to a nation of
degraded vagabond Jews, to get murdered for his pains; and this
Saviour's second rule, or advent, as a spiritual power to a few sub-
races or Western people who value little else but money and position,
whose motto is, "All sink if I swim," and whose only real God is Gold;
this second advent is esoterically, they say, the true conception of
Christ within, instead of without the Human Soul, of the people; but
this theory is absurd upon the face of it, because the acknowledgement
120 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
of this Divine inner principle has been accepted before by various
peoples since the Pyramids were erected. But granting, for the sake
of argument, that the galleries do point to some modern date, why
not say they refer to 1881? after the birth of Guatama Buddha,
equally as well as the orthodox Jesus. Buddha's doctrines have found
far more followers and accomplished infinitely more moral purity and
brotherly love than Christianity, besides being free; absolutely free;
from the foulest blot of every other creed;-Human Blood. Buddha's
teachings, or words of Guatama Buddha (not the false doctrines and
interpolations falsely denominated as Esoteric Buddhism, but I mean
the original teachings of Buddha himself) ever tend to scientific free
thought and self spiritual culture, but orthodox Christianity just the
reverse in every particular. Orthodox Christian theology has always,
in every age, opposed with all its colossal might, the least step toward
progress and reformation; it has deluged every country under its
baneful rule in torrents of Human Blood and exterminated, with fire
and sword, every opposing school of thought. It stands pre-eminent
as the only religious creed on the earth that proclaims a free salva-
tion to the crime-stained soul, and the Divine efficacy of the atoning
hlood of the murdered Prophet. It is the only religion the world has
seen that preaches the comfortable doctrine of eternal damnation mid
fl::tmes of hell fire for the noble free-thinkers, who refuse to credit the
infamous pretensions of its priesthood. This religion beg;an with the
hlood of the innocents·, and its history through the ages is recorded
on every page in the eternal crimson letters of Human gore, until,
Human nature rebelled against this inhuman Christian monster, and
bound the power of the Church for evil in chains of adamant. Those
who say that our advanced western civilization, and superiority in
Art, Science and Manufacture, is an incontrovertible proof of the
superiority of the Christian over the Buddhist influence, know nothing
of Occult Law. The eastern races, over which Buddhism holds sway,
have been traveling in the descending arc of progress, while most of
the western, or Christian nations, were ascending the arc of the
cycle. Look at eastern Christians, if any proof be required, who were
in possession of Christianity before the west, and ought to be superior,
but are they? Just as it has been before, so will it be again. The
Orientals will be a highly polished and civilized race, trying perhaps
to instruct the west by means of missionaries, when our remote de-
LA CLEF 121
scendants are rude barbarians. Remember the "Hermetic Law." "That
which has been will also be again," or, in other words, "History re-
peats itself." The names of Christ and Christianity ought to be ban-
ished forever from the minds of all students of Occult Science. Let
us have the simple teachings attributed to the man Jesus, if you will,
but never call anything divine by the name Christ or Christian, al-
though Christ or Christos anciently referred to the inner light of man.
We require a new name that shall express the coming influx of the
age; a name quite unassociated with Christian Theology. But, to re-
turn to our former argument, Esoteric Christians do not truly compre-
hend the underlying principles of the Occult, or they would not refer
the Pyramids to anything Christian. We could say why the Pyramid
was designed, at what era of the world it was built, who its great
architect was, and why the Grand Gallery measured 1881 pyramidial
inches, or the double 9, but refrain; such things are not committed to
writing. The builders of the Great Pyramid, though knowing that
each Cycle produces its own great teachers, probably never for one
moment contemplated the actual personal existence of Jesus.
The mythical Jesus of the Christian Gospels is composed or made
up from three different sources;-Firstly, Egyptian Theology; Osiris,
Isis, and Horus, have been converted into Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost (or the Virgin Mary). Egyptian fables, in reference to the
birth, death, descent into hades, etc., have become Christian truths in
reference to Jesus; while his ultimate position as the final judge of
Humanity is only that of the resurrected, glorified Osiris; who lived
thousands of years before the Orthodox Adam was turned out of the
Garden of Eden. The second element of this triune composition, is the
traditions of the actual Jesus, the Jewish Adept of the Essenes, in
referenc~ to his ministry among the poor, down-trodden inhabitants
of his country.
The third and most important element is the actual "Life" and
Miracles (so called) of Appolonius of Tyanna. This man was born
about the year of the popular A.D. 1, and is the central figure, around
which has been draped the Egyptian Myths and traditions of a Jew-
ish Adept, the whole combined and greatly assisted by the pious for-
geries of the early Christian Fathers, constitute the well known Orth-
odox "Life of Christ." The Gospel Jesus, as taught by Christianity,
never existed.
CHAPTER VII
NARONIA
THE MYSTICAL CYCLE OF THE SUN
The real secrets and the inner mysteries of the sacred "Naros"
appear to have been entirely unknown to either medieval or modern
writers. In fact, the most prominent writers upon occult and theo-
sophical subjects generally avoid all mention of it; or, if they do ex-
press their ideas, it is only upon its cosmic, or external aspects, as it
applies to the Macrocosm, of the sidereal heavens. But of its spiritual
and mystical importance, as it applies to the human soul of the Micro-
cosm, they are universally silent. Briefly stated, the "Naros," in its
astronomical and physical aspects, is a Luni-Solar Cycle of the period
of the Sun and Moon, and is completed in six hundred years; and,
strangely enough, such a period also coincides with some remarkable
revolution in the mental and theological affairs of humanity; hence
a few extracts from prominent writers will not be out of place to pre-
pare the student for that which is to follow.
Madam Blavatsky, speaking of the Naros in "Isis Unveiled," Vol.
I, pages 31-33, remarks "that he (G. Higgins) fails to decipher it (the
Cycle) is made apparent; for, as it pertains to the mysteries of
creation, this Cycle was the most inviolable of all. It was repeated in
symbolic figures only in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, the original
book, which, if now extant, is not to be found in libraries."
To the foregoing we may also add, neither will this Chaldean
Book be found in the crypts of Thibet, Madam B. to the contrary not-
withstanding. She very pointedly tells her readers where they cannot
find such a book, but very wisely maintains a discreet silence as to
where this rare work can be found.
The learned Countess of Caithness, in her recent volume, "The
Mystery of the Ages," mentions the Naros on page 361 viz. "To the
Christian Theosophist, Jesus is a manifestation of 'Adonai', the Christ,
or Christ Spirit, of whom there have been many incarnations on this
Earth, and He the fullest and most perfect. They believe Him to be
the guiding guardian protector of this planet during His particular
cvcle. and that in coming to it, He comes to His own, not only to in-
NARONIA 123
struct, but to give a fresh impulse at the end of certain periods of six
hundred years, called Naroses, or Naronic Cycles, and if, therefore, it
could be proven by those who assert that Jesus is only a mythical, and
not an historical personality, the whole theory of the Naronic Cycles,
founded on astronomical science, which is to be found in the doctrines
of every ancient country, all over the civilized world, would fall to
the ground, and prove after a million of ages to be but a vain de-
lusion."
It is scarcely necessary for us to point out that, if the Naros is as
the authoress asserts, "founded upon astronomical science," then the
Cycle is an astronomical fact, and as such is capable of mathematical
demonstration; consequently is, and always must be, totally independ-
ent of the existence of individuals. In fact, an astronomical cycle, if
true, possesses no real relationship with any personality, human or
Divine, and this being the case, the Naronic Cycle will remain just the
same truth, upon the plane to which it naturally belongs, whether the
Christian Jesus is proven to be either Myth, Man or God. Neither
does the genuine student of Occultism care, very much, in which po-
sition the supposed Redeemer is placed by the masses.
Therefore, the statement of the authoress that without the actual
physical incarnation of the personal Jesus this theory of "millions of
ages" would prove to be a vain delusion is the very height of mystical
absurdity, and the self-evident inanity of such an illogical argument
must surely become apparent to all reflective minds.
The learned Dr. Kennealy, Q.C., etc., in his book "Book of God,"
makes mention of the Naros upon pages 52, 53 where, viewing the
period as a Messianic Cycle, he remarks; "This Naros is the Luni-Solar
Naros, or Sibylline year. It is composed of 31 periods of 19 years
each and one of 11, and is the most perfect of astronomical cycles, and,
although no chronologer has mentioned it at length, it is the most
ancient of all. It consists of six hundred years, or 7200 Solar months,
or 219,l461
h days, and this same number of days, 219,146%, gives 600
years, consisting each of 365 days, 5 hours, 51 minutes and 36 seconds,
which differs less than 3 minutes from what the length is observed
to be at this day."
"If on the first of January, at noon, a new Moon too\: place in
any part of the heavens, it would take place again in exactly six hun-
drl'd w~ars. at the same moment and under the same physical circum-
124 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
stances. The Sun, stars and planets would all be in the same relative
position." And in corroboration of what this learned doctor says,
Prof. Cassini, one of the great modern astronomers, declares "this
Naros to be the most perfect of all periods."
From this, then, we see the utter nonsense of modern theosoph-
ical mystics trying to twist and warp the harmonies of natural laws
to suit their dreamy, sentimental speculations. The Naros exists in
spite of each and every attempt of hallucinated mystics to make it
conform to their erroneous doctrines.
The Luni-Solar Cycle of 600 years is the absolute measurement
of mental development, and the Luni-Solar conjunction, which com-
mences and terminates this Cycle, evolves forth the embryonic con-
ditions which shall, during its rule, become manifested in the physical
world. It is not true, from an occult stand-point, that the Naros
specially refers to the birth of some great Saviour or Reformer. It is
only true, that the conditions which this Naronic conjunction evolve
prepare the way and call forth the man or men, who shall act as the
pioneers in the world's need of a higher and a more liberal teaching.
At the same time it will always be found that some very prominent
teacher or reformer is born into the world at about the same time,
not definitely to any nation or country, or exactly on time, within a
generation or two, but always near to the period of the Cycle; but
such teachers and law-givers are not the cause of the Naros, neither do
they become incarnated to fulfill the Cycle, as the Countess of Caith-
ness very foolishly imagines, but they appear simply as the result
of increased mental energies, or in the downward arc of the race
they appear to crystallize the existing truths and veil those things
which have ceased to be of use and which may become a source of
evil.
A brief outline of this thread of mental evolution can be traced,
by noting that Guatama Buddha appeared in 600 B.C. or thereabouts,
and that 600 years later the Jewish Reformer, Appolonius of Tyanna,
appeared upon the scene of the world's history, then in another 600
years Mahomet, with his warlike issues came upon the planes of
human existence. Another Naros passes away when we have a com-
plete host of inspired reformers, and the Reformation began, viz.,
1200 A.D. to 1300 A.D. and lastly, we bridge yet another cycle of the
Sun and Lo; we have 1881 A.D. ~nd naturally all eyes are looking
NARONIA 125
for another Saviour. The Adventists speak of the second coming of
Christ. The Shakers claim that He has already come in the form of
Mother Ann Lee. On the other hand the Mormons say that Joseph
Smith is the modern Messiah.
It is not of course necessary to say that all of these earnest, and
doubtless well meaning sects, are wrong, outrageously in error, be-
cause no such Messiah will appear, at least not to them. He will
move in the world quite unsuspected as to His true and real greatness;
He will do His work comparatively unknown to the world at large;
He will be looked upon as an ordinary individual by those who know
Him; He will suffer the vilest kind of persecution at the hands of
the Inversive element whb dread the force of the principles He will
leave behind him. His greatest friends, though mystified as to His
real nature, will never grasp His real reality until He is beyond their
purview. The Messianic Messenger of the ages will not be fully
known until He has passed through the valley of the shadow of death,
and is beyond the power of the world to flatter or condemn.
The Jews were looking for a Monarch, and a sign from heaven;
the sign came, but the Monarch materialized under a very different
form from what they expected. He came as the son of a carpenter.
So the Christians of to-day are looking for the pomp and glory of a
Celestial King. They, too, are looking for a sign from heaven; the
sign came with the great perihelion of the planet in 1880 and 1881,
and we may depend upon it that the teacher was there, ready and
willing, but the world knows Him not, nor will it; the time has passed
and He can only be known by the generations which are to follow.
Hope, Faith and Charity were the symbols of the Nazarene. They
were needed in His day and time, but Life, Light and Love are the
great requirements of to-day; they are the pressing needs of the hour.
Having given our students some brief insight into the purely ma-
terial aspect of the Naros we will not speak of its infinite ramifications
upon the physical plane, but reveal a hidden mystery, a mystery that
many occult students have hinted at, spoken of, and even attempted
to define, but so far they have failed to grasp either its philosophy,
basis, or its potency.
The esoteric aspect of the Naros is known to the occult Initiates
as the Mystery of Naronia, and refers to the expansion and contrac-
tion of the human constitution. As a sort of illustration let us take
126 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
the motion of the tides, the ebb and the flow. When the Sun and the
Moon occupy the same plane in reference to the Earth, we have the
high spring tides, etc. It is the saii:J.e upon the mental plane, with
the human brain. The brain of man, magnetically, expands and be-
comes illuminated by the Luni-Solar influx, from the new to the full
Moon, at which time this magnetic force is at its maximum. It is
high tide, so to say, and those who have the care and experience of
lunatics will verify the fact, that, they become perfect astronomical
calendars of the Moon's increase and decrease of light.
Let us take a step further, and we then come to the real domin-
ions of Naronia. SHE is the CYCLE of the SOUL and enacts upon
the spiritual plane of human existence, a similar series of events to
those of the Naros upon the mundane sphere of life. Hence, we can
trace a perfect analogy between the motions of the luminaries in
space and the revolution of purely psychic entities within the odylic
sphere of man.
Each year of life, the Earth, in her orbit, transits the point in
space which she occupied at a person's birth, or in other words, the
Sun returns to the same sign and degree of the Zodiac that he occupied
in the horoscope. In this transit, the Solar force renews the life en-
ergies of the Soul and regalvanizes them with additional force (we
are speaking spiritually, understand). These germs of new forces are
Virtues, Powers, Potencies and Deific attributes of the great Solar Orb.
They are spiritual ovums, or seeds of human possibilities, and if con-
sciously nourished and cherished will evolve powers and states within
the Human Soul, which correspond in their action to our hidden
spiritual attributes. If unnoticed, uncared for, they remain until other
forces polarize them, and then pass onward down their cycle.
When the Moon, in the course of her motion, arrives at the same
place during each month, she impregnates these seeds and endows
them with magnetic life; therefore, in an occult sense, she confers
upon humanity the powers and possibilities of magical forces. It is
this Luni-Solar influx of Naronia within the human constitution, then,
that controls the real foundation and basis of spiritual development
and occult power.
Remember these most important facts, then, and, guided by your
own spiritual intuitions in the matter, use this knowledge according
to the light which Nature has already given you, or which you shall
NARONIA 127
hereafter receive. We have revealed to you the mystery of Naronia;
have given you an outline sketch of its basis in Nature, and its phil-
osophy in human evolution, as near as it is possible without leading
you out of your safe path, or bringing you nigh unto dangerous ground.
For those who are ready to utilize this mystery, what we have
here said will be plain and easy of comprehension. For those who
are not yet ready, rest assured, it is wiser to wait until your spiritual
nature is more highly developed.

SOUL KNOWLEDGE
THE LOGOS, OR BOOK OF WISDOM
EXPLANATORY NOTE: The Atama Bodha or Book of Soul Knowledge, is copied
from a free translation of a very Ancient Sanskrit Manuscript, written upon Palm
Leaves, and cannot be obtained except in rare and isolated Buddhist convents in
the remote parts of India and Tartary. It is therefore placed at the disposal of
Neophytes as a valuable Manuscript, of an unique and exceedingly rare work of
great merit. T. H. Burgoyne, Private Secretary.
BOOK I
THE LOGOS, OR BOOK OF WISDOM
"The Qualities cannot know the soul (DiVine Ego),
But the Soul knows all Qualities." Mokah.
"Know the Divinity that is within you,
That you may know the Divine One,
Of which your Soul is but a ray." Proclus.
"He who sees all things in the Soul, and the Soul in all things, does
not slight anything. It is more refined than an atom, and cannot be
approached by argumentation. The truly wise, knowing the ubiquitous
Soul, which sees the wakeful and the profoundly sleeping states, do not
mourn. The Soul is pure, because it does not participate in the Qual-
ities; it is distinct from the Qualities, because it is, itself, wisdom."
From the Sanskrit work, Katha.
"Know, then, that salvation is not attained by uttering Mantras,
or by the burning of incense, or observing thousands of fasts. Until
the incarnated Soul knows that he is divine, he cannot attain salva-
tion." Mahanirvana Tantra.
"As in a deamond (Magic) mirrow, one cannot see forms re-
flected, so a Spirit with immature organs cannot attain knowledge.
As in unripe fruit, sweet juice cannot be found, so is knowledge not
found in an undeveloped organism. The knowledge of. the Divine
element being in us, is, therefore, the first requisite, and as we acquire
that knowledge, we progress in the development of the inner life, and
SOUL KNOWLEDGE 129
any protest against that knowledge shuts us out from the Spiritual
Life." Yagnaval Kya.
ATAMABODHA
I. This book of Soul Knowledge is composed for those who have
effaced their sins by penitence, who have attained the perfect tran-
quillity, who have destroyed their passions, and who aspire to the
final deliverance.
II. Of all means, there is but one, Knowledge, that is efficacious
for the obtaining of deliverance, even as there is no cooking without
fire, can one not arrive at final deliverance without Knowledge.
III. For want of being opposed to it, action knows not to repulse
ignorance, but Knowledge dissipates ignorance, as light dissipates
the darkness of heavy clouds.
IV. Fettered in some wise by ignorance, but again becoming free
when she is destroyed (Atma, Atma, Spirit, or Human Soul and
Brahma, divine Soul) becomes of itself resplendent of great light,
as the sun upon disappearance of the clouds.
V. After the Divine Soul (Brahma), troubled by ignorance, has
been purified by the exercise of knowledge, the knowledge itself
vanishes (diffuses), even as the grain Kalaka in water.
NoTE: Kalaka is used in many parts of India to purify stagnant and brackish water.
The natural purifiers are very valuable in the East, and the Kalaka here referred
to dissolves immediately when placed in water, hence the passage, "Diffuses even
as the Grain Kalaka in water." The student is also here referred to an interesting
account of the sweetening of brackish waters in the 15th. Chapter of the Book of
Exodus. "So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out in the
wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness and found no
water, and when they came to Morah, they could not drink of the waters of
Morah, for they were bitter, and the people murmured against Moses saying, what
shall we drink? and he (Moses) cried unto the Lord, and the Lord showed him
a tree, which, when he had cast it into the waters they were made sweet," etc. Many
kinds of plants will clarify water and make it sweet, the same as the oak cullings
used in the waters of the land of La Gronde.
VI. Similar to the image of a dream, the world is continually
troubled by love, by hate, and other passions. As long as the dream
lasts, it appears to be real, but on awakening, it passes on into non-
reality.
VII. The phenomenal world appears as real, even as the oyster
shell appears to be silver, as long as Brahma is not known, He that
is above all things, indivisible.
130 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
VIII. All the varieties of being are comprised in the One Being,
veritable and intelligent, who is bound up with all, eternal, all pene-
trating, even as gold is in all variety of ornaments.
IX. Even as the air, director of the organs of sense, the Master,
susceptible of diverse attributes, appears as distinct, by reason of their
distinctions, but when these attributes are destroyed (latent.), it vir-
tually becomes one.
X. By virtue of these diverse attributes, species, names and dif-
ferent states are communicated to the Spirit, in the same wise as
different colors are to the water.
XI. The body, formed of the combination of the elements to the
number of five; Fire, Earth, Air, Water and Vital Breath; produced
by the effect of action (Energy), thus forms the seat of perception
of pleasure and of pain.
XII. The subtle body (Astral Body), which is not the issue of
the five grosser elements, but which is united with the five breaths of
life, with the faculty of interior comprehension (Manas), with in-
telligence (Buddhi), and the ten organs, is the instrument of the
perception of the interior senses.
XIII. The an-beginning (indefinite), ignorance without begin-
ning (undefined), is called the casual attribute, but which differs
essentially from that triplicity of attributes, which is to be under-
stood as Spirit (Atmanam Avadhavy).
XIV. In union with the five envelopes (Five Rogas), the pure
Spirit, or Soul, subsists as the nature of one or the other, absolutely
in the same wise, as a crystal reflects the colors of the various matters
that are brought near it.
XV. Strive by concentrating the thought (mind) to liberate the
supreme Soul, pure and free of the envelopes (Elements) to which
she is united, that the body and the other, in the same wise as is
sifted the grain from the chaff.
NoTE: The elements here referred to are the same intelligent forces generated by
the so-called four primary elements fire, earth, air and water, and may be appropri-
ately designated the Elementals of the Astral Plane, who become active agents in
the fiery circulus, or astral zone, of the third or fourth dimensions of space. They
are soulless, semi-material, magnetic beings, and are the chief, and in a great
majority of cases, the only causes of the physical phenomena known to modern
spiritualism. It is these elementals, and in fact this Astral Plane that constitutes the
well-known Dwellers on the threshold in Occultism.
SOUL KNOWLEDGE 131
XVI. The Soul, although it penetrates into all things, does not
manifest itself in all places; but it becomes manifest in intelligence
(thought), as the reflection on the surface of a mirror.
XVII. The Spirit must be distinguished from the body, the organs
of sense, the interior sense and the intelligence, who has perfected
its nature, in the same wise as a true King watches his attendants.
NoTE: The Divine Spirit, or Ego, as also the Divine Soul, must not, under any
circumstances, be confounded with the reason (mind). Intelligent reason, etc., are
but varied expressions of Soul on the external plane, and do not exist at all within
the pure realm of Spirit proper.
XVIII. As long as the organs of sense are in action, the Spirit
is apparently acting in the same wise, as the Moon appears to be in
motion, when the clouds pass by.
XIX. Having recourse to the Vital force of the Spirit, the body,
the organs of sense, the interior comprehension and the thoughts
(Mind) accomplish their respective functions, as men do their daily
work by the light of the Sun.
XX. It is through absence of discernment, that the living and
intelligent Spirit is attributed, the qualities or actions of the body,
and the organs of sense, as there is attributed a blue color to the
firmament.
XXI. Action and other qualities that belong to the attributes of
the Manus (interior comprehension), are placed in the Spirit, through
ignorance only, even as the motion of the waves is supposed to be
caused by the Moon's reflection on the water.
XXII. Passions, desires, pleasures, and pain, dwell in the human
mind, in as long as it exists in reality. In the state of profound sleep,
when it ceases to be, they, as will are no more, they belong, there-
fore, to the intelligence, not to Spirit (Soul).
XXIII. Even as clearness is the pre-eminent quality of the Sun,
heat of fire, also following in nature, the Spirit, essentially is life,
beatitude, eternity, purity.
XXIV. The living and the intelligent part of Spirit (Atman) and
activity of intelligence are distinct things. When by ignorance they
are identified, the people say "I know."
XXV. There is no change for Spirit, there is not even knowledge
for the intelligence; the Soul, knowing all things in excess, is subject
to illusions, so far as to say, "I act."
132 THE LIGHT OF' EGYPT
NoTE: The one great thing needful for all Neophytes is to thoroughly realize the
vast difference between the appearances and the reality. There is much that could
be impressed as to the state which will enable one to distinguish between truth
and appearance of truth. Know, then, that all things possessing form and weight
are not what they seem, but are only external representatives of a more interior
Spiritual correspondence. The Human Ego, like the divine Soul, possess(ls neither
form nor weight; they are the pure formless emanations of Brahma. That which
we may term Soul is but the external expression of the interior Soul, in itself
invisible.
XXVI. If he take himself for the individual Soul, as (by mistake)
one takes a rope for a serpent, the Spirit contracts a great fright, but
when he comes to understand, "I am not the Soul, but the sovereign
.Spirit," he is freed from all fear.
XXVII. The Spirit (Soul) of itself causes to appear the organs of
sense, and at their head, intelligence (mind), as a lamp illuminates
a vase and other objects. But the Spirit, in its real self, is not illumi:
nated by these inert things.
XXVIII. The Spirit (Soul) whose condition of being is knowledge,
desires not the knowledge of another on the subject of its own know-
ledge, in the same wise as a lamp giving its own light, has no need
for another lamp, to be seen.
NoTE: Or in other words, having attained the absolute condition of the At-one-ment,
it cannot possibly be aided by any outside or external help, seeing that it is one
with the Father.
XXIX. One having recognized the Upadhis, or attributes, without
exception, saying, "This is not, This is not," let him recognize the
unity of the Supreme Spirit, and of the Soul, by virtue of the great
words, having rejected all the attributes of things temporal with such
terms as, "It is not, It is not," let him strive to discern the identity of
God (Brahma) and of the Soul, but obsequied by the celebrated
words of Holy Writ, "Thou art He," This Soul is Brahma (God),
"I am He."
XXX. Whatever cleaves to the body is the product of ignorance,
it is visible, it is perishable as a bubble, but in that, which has not
such marks of distinction, let the pure Being be recognized, saying
of himself, "I am Brahma."
XXXI. (Thus says the Soul): To contain any difference from the
body, I experience neither birth nor death, nor age, nor decreptitude,
nor extinction, and am disconnected from the organs of sense. I have
no point of attachment to their objects, even like a circle, when one
SOUL KNOWLEDGE 133
comes to know the Soul by the intelligence of Scripture, one arrives
at the speculative science of the Soul, which is herein resumed in Five
Slokas. The first step in the way of life is reading the Sacred Books;
the second is meditation, wherein the language of the Soul is
understood.
NOTE: The language of the Soul is not, in its strict sense, Intuition, but is that one
sole attribute of the spiritual intelligence, viz., Divine Perception. Intuition can
only be called the language of the Soul upon the more external planes of manifested
Being.
XXXII. Being freed from the Manan, or mind's sentiments, I do
not experience pain, passion, hate, fear, love, or other passions or
affections. I am that which is established by the precept of revelation,
without breath, without Manus, absolutely pure.
XXXIII. Of Brahma is born the breath of life (Prana), the mind;
all the organs of sense are air, the wind, light, water and earth, nursing
all that which exists.
XXXIV. I am without quality, without activity, eternal, without
will, without impurity, without change, without form, forever liberated,
perfectly pure.
XXXV. I am as the Ether, penetrating all things, without and
within. I am without imperfections, ever the same in all, pure in
passions, immaculate, immovable.
XXXVI. He who is eternal, pure, free, one, entirely happy (in
the supreme happiness), without duality (undivided), veritable, real,
existence, Science, the Infinite, the supreme One, (Brahma) I am He.
NoTE: There is no such thing as sentiment recognized within the pale of pure
occultism; sentiment always creates for itself, some grand ideal of an apparent
reality, which in itself is but Maya or illusion.
SOUL KNOWLEDGE-BOOK II
ExPLANATORY NoTE: It must be borne in mind by the raader that the second part
of the Book of Wisdom is in reality a commentary, or explanation of the first Book,
and herein is set forth the actual secrets of the Kosmos. The whole arcana of Hindu
Occultism is here laid bare of its arcane terms and its metaphysics, so bewildering
to Western minds. It means the Initiation of the Soul and as such, it must be con-
sidered wholly apart from any internal formula, or ceremonial rite, consequently,
it corresponds mystically with the perfect at-one-ment of the early primitive
Christians, who taught that the kingdom of heaven (the region of Brahma) was
within. The full realization of this will sureiy bring unto the Neophyte that peace
of God which passeth all understanding, or the true Nirvana of our Oriental
Brethren. T. H. Burgoyne.
BOOK OF WISDOM
I. Such a conception, "I am Brahma himself," incessantly main-
tained, dissipates the hallucinations born of ignorance even as a valu-
able medicine drives out disease.
NoTE: It is of great importance for Neophytes to fully realize that the constant
formulation of any idea, will, in due time (other conditions being fulfilled), through
a process of Psychic evolution, cause the subjective ideal to become an objective
fact, or from the embryonic plane of the soul state, to exist as a real entity, a
veritable spiritual reality. This is the true secret of the evolution of the Soul-powers
evolved by Occult training, and which in due time produces the all potent, perfect
man, the Adept.
II. Sitting in solitude, freed from the passions, having completely
mastered his senses, let a man picture to himself this Spirit, the su-
preme One, the eternally Infinite, without allowing his thoughts to be
diverted.
NoTE: Solitary meditation is one of the means of success in the soul's search for
Brahma. He who submits himself to the severe discipline of the Ancient ritual of
training, will be in the best condition to contemplate, directly and without trouble,
the Infinite Being, "One," "Indivisible."
The philosopher will have no other thought. That is to say, his own intelligence
will have a constant application to Brahma alone, but to nothing outside of that
most Holy, interior plane;-read, work, learn, and inwardly digest the words
in the New Testament; "retire to thy closet, secretly, when alone in thy chamber,
etc. to pray." This is the solitary meditation referred to by this Ancient Hindu
writing, and when alone in the secret communion with your own Soul, bow thy
head in reverence and awe before the radiant visitors from the world beyond.
III. Considering the visible universe as annihilated in the Spirit;
let the man, pure in intelligence, contemplate continually the one
Spirit, (Soul), as he would the luminous Ether.
SOUL KNOWLEDGE 135
IV. This continual formation of the Soul's ideal, which, in its
silent aspirations, associates itself with the divine universal Soul, en-
ables it to attain the union with Brahma.
V. When such union is attained, the pure Soul can fully realize
its previous conceptions and thus participates in all the attributes of
the Infinite One.
VI. Then knowing the highest essence, he rejects all that is dis-
tinguished by name, by form, or otherwise, and he dwells firmly in
the at-one-ment, with the self existent, perfect, intelligent and happy
Being.
VII. There is not in the supreme Spirit (Soul) any distinction
between the perceiver, the perception and the object perceived in
his quality of the one being, intelligent and happy. He shines by his
own light.
VIII. Thus when the friction of meditation, without cessation,
is made upon the word of the Spirit, the flame which issues thereform,
consumes all the combustible matter of ignorance.
NoTE: The ancient Sages have defined the recompense awarded to him who has
contemplated. They have recourse to a comparison which frequently presents
itself to the imagination of Hindo writers. Atma, or the Spirit, is likened to the
Arani, a hard wood used for friction, a second Arani, the Manas, or mind is
applied to the first. The friction of these two woods being made (the mind and
the Spirit) continually, by the exercise of silent meditation, the knowledge of
true science, which proceeds from it after the manner of a flame (from friction)
destroys completely the combustible portion of the wood of ignorance, even to
its very roots, with all that which proceeds from it. Then the aspirant for perfect
deliverance is confirmed in his royalty, and finds that he has accomplished his duty.
IX. When the previous ignorance has been dissipated by know-
ledge (comparable to the light of dawn), then the Spirit itself mani-
fests itself in a manner, shining like the Sun.
X. The Spirit, always accessible, becomes as inaccessible, as the
consequence of ignorance. This being dissipated, it shines as fully and
as truly accessible, in the same wise as jewels on a maiden's neck,
though she may have forgotten them.
XI. The Spirit of life (Principle of life) the undivided Soul, the
living Soul, is attributed, by error, to the supreme Being, or Brahma,
as in contempt we attribute, or liken the outward physical form of man
to that of his Creator.
NoTE: Again it is necessary to say we must not confound the Soul with the great
Spirit; neither must we disquiet ourselves by trying too soon to distinguish in
one's self the Soulf the principal of individual life, but be content to know one's
self to be identica with the universe, with Brahma Himself.
136 THE UC:Il r Of' ECYPT
XII. But once having seen the tn•e nature of the Spirit of life,
this error disappears of itself.
Xlll. The l-nowledge that is born of the comprehension of the
being, having, of himself, his existence in reality, destroys completely
the ignornnce that c.:'\uscs us to say, "1 nm,'' "I nrn not," or "thnt npper·
tnins to me," in the same mnllnt<r that the light of the Sun dissipat"s
all darkness nod uncertainty in the visible response of the sky.
XIV. The Y

l>latcs all things as subsisting within himself, and thus, by the eye of
lcnowledge, he discover> that all is but the one and the same. Spirit
or Soul.
:o\OTB; Our ant:ient Author wishC':~ to $:lY how the Yogi sees, wilhout distinction

XV. He who is from the force of vitality the potent man rejects
the qualities of the anterior attributes, viz., body, mind, etc., arc. on
a higher plnne. only the oonooption.. of ignol";looo. He bceorncs Brahma
by reason of the essential natJre of his interior formative being, thus
he is perfectly happy, even ru the chrysalis becoming the butterlly.
XVI. After having tra,·erscd the great ocean of illusion; after
havirtg destroyed in himscU tl1e evil Genii of passion, of hate, and
other vices, tl1e Yogi shines intimately, collected in tranquility, and
finds his ioy in the Soul.
XVII. Renouncing all nttnchments to an external and G
eeting
happiness, satisfied with the IH>ppiness of the Soul, the wise man is
forever resplendent in the interior light, and, similar to a lamp under
• glass shade, does he himself protect.
XVlll. The Muni ascetic, although he submits to the attributes
of the body, but comparable tn the Ether, not being soiled by the
nnturnl properties, should, although he knows all comfort himself,
as an ignorant man passing as the \vind, detached from all things,
yet mntcrial.
XIX. From the moment the attributes are destruyed, the Muni
(As<.-ctie) enters immediately Into that which l>enctnltos all things
as the water into wat'er nnd nh· into nir, the fire into tho fire.
XX. The J>OSscssion, after which there is none other to desire,
SOUL KNOWLEDGE 137
the felicity, above which there is no greater felicity, the science, above
which there is no greater science, let it be known-This is Brahma.
XXI. There is no being within, without, above, or beyond the
One Being. All the interior, movable world, is the spirit of the One,
and the external world is the same soul. Nothing exists apart from
the One, and this One is Brahma.
XXII. The seen (object of vision), after which nothing more is
desired to be seen, the existence in union of which there is no fresh
birth possible, the knowledge above which there is no knowledge
desired, let it be known,-This is Brahma.
XXIII. The Being that feels all in the intermediary, superior and
inferior religions, living, intelligent, happy, without a second (duality),
eternal and one, let it be known,-This is Brahma.
XXIV. That which is designated in the Books of the Vedanta
under the mode of existence, rejecting all that is not for its own self,
the imperishable, incessantly happy, the One, let it be known,-It is
Brahma.
XXV. Admitted to a portion of happiness, belonging properly to
the Being incessantly happy, Brahma; and the other Gods (Gods of
the vulgar masses), because at various degrees, partially happy.
XXVI. All things belong to Him (tl1e One), all activity depends
on the One (Intelligent). This is why Brahma is everywhere diffused,
as cream in the mass of milk.
XXVII. That which is neither bound, nor gross, nor short, nor
long, nor subject to birth, nor perishable, that which is without fonn,
without quality, without color, without name, let it be known,-lt is
Brahma.
XXVIII. He by whose splendor shines the Sun and the stars, but
who is not enlightened by their lightness, He by whom all things are
illuminated, let it be known,-It is Brahma.
XXIX. Penetrating all of himself, alone from within and from
without, illuminating the entire universe, Brahma shines from afar,
even as the light of radiant Suns.
XXX. Brahma has no similarity of appearance with the worlds,
for in reality, there exists nothing else but Brahma. Shall something
produce itself external to Him? It is nothing but a vain appearance,
as a mirage, that figures on the wastes of the desert.
138 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
XXXI. All that is seen, all that is heard, is not different from
Brahma, and by a knowledge of the truth, this Brahma is contemplated
as the existent, intelligent, happy, indivisible Being.
XXXII. The eye of science contemplates this living, intelligent,
happy, all-penetrating Being, but the eye of ignorance knows not how
to contemplate it, in the same way as a blind man knows not how to
contemplate the varied forms of external nature around him.
XXXIII. The soul, illuminated by the sacred lore and other means
of knowledge, warmed by the fire of science and purified, shines of
itself with the brilliancy of gold seven times purified in the furnace.
XXXIV. The Atman Spirit (or Divine Soul), the sum of all know-
ledge, resting in the ether of the heart, drives away darkness, pene-
trates all, shines, and all is illuminated.
XXXV. This is the great completion of existence; it is the great
and final deliverance from sin, from pain, and also from death; and
when compared with the vanities of this illusionary world, it is the
Pearl of Great Price, and happy indeed is he who becomes its
possessor.
XXXVI. He, therefore, who undertakes the pilgrimage of the soul
that is within his own self, without considering the state of the heavens
or the country, or the time, dissipates the cold and the heat, and attains
unto a perpeh1al happiness, free from all impurity. This one, freed
completely of works, becomes omniscient, all-penetrating, and
immortal.
SOUL KNOWLEDGE-BOOK III
THE APHORESMATA OF THE LOGOS
I. Whatever exists, either exists as a whole, as God, or is a part,
or an emanation from God.
II. In the Whole as an angel, unconscious of the Whole, is an
undescended Spirit.
III. Parted from the Whole, yet a portion of the Whole, and un-
conscious of the Whole, is the law of differentiation.
IV. Parted from the Whole, with the Whole, yet external to the
Whole, is a descended or fallen spirit.
V. Parted from the Whole, with the Whole, yet conscious of the
Whole, and knowing it has fallen away from, and that it should, and
can, return to the Whole, is the Law of Reascension.
VI. That which is parted from the Whole, and turns again to the
Whole, is the Law of True Repentance.
VII. That which was parted from the Whole, and has again re-
turned to the Whole, as a part of the Whole, remains so forever as a
blest spirit, and is the Law of Perfect At-one-ment.
CONCLUDING NOTE
Materialistic Science demonstrates, beyond all disputes, the in-
destructibility of matter, and consequently aids, assists and verifies
the teachings of our ancient Sages, who taught, as we still teach, that
matter is but an objective phenomena, expressing form and weight,
which in themselves, are but relative terms. Matter is but the condi-
tion of the external, expressing by its infinite correlations and forces,
its exact correspondence with an internal cause. It is the same thing
in a negative state, or the antipodes of Spirit. Matter and Spirit,-
what are they? They do not exist, except as relative terms to express
the ideal states of the one Primeval Force, viz., of Action and Repose.
T. H. Burgoyne.
THE SOE!\CE OF THE SOUL-SECTION Ill
THE REALITIES OF LIFE
CHAPTER I
THE SOUL-ITS X ATURE AS'D AT11\.18VT£$
'lhe divine spirit is to the soul what
the soul is to the body."- Plutarch.
First, we must speak of the soul. If it were possible for a duad
to exist in which there was a distinction without n difference, we should
say that such a combination was n perfect type of "soul" and "spirit."
But ns such is not in existence, we must try to express both the dis-
tinction and tho diff~.renoe by other typos, albeit, in regard to soul
and spirit, the one is not perceptible without the presence of the other.
The terms, "soul" and "spirit" have become interblcndcd in such
hopeless confusion, that it seems almost impossible to unravel the
tangled skeins of dc6nitions, nnd present a clear, comprehensive out-
line of tl1e two and show them as they really nre when viewed in the
light of spiritunl illumin:ttion.
The soul is not the spirit, but it is that by which the spirit is
known, or, rather, that by which we understond the nature and powers
of the spirit. In the flrst chapter of this work n complete definition of
spirit is given, so far as humnn bnguage ean express or define an
undefinable entity. When we come to define the soul, we are (.'(Im-
pelled to usc illustration.s tll~t shall follow out the definition there
given.
We have spoken of the spiritual Ego as nn atom of divinity, a
seinlillnting atomic point evolved from the divine soul of the Deity.
Now, while this is quite true as regards the Ego, yet, when we de-
sire to define the soul we must request the render not to confuse the
two, but, a.s a mere matter of mental convenience. consider them as
the cause and effect, so to say, of spiritual evolution.
The soul is formless and intangible, and constitutes the attributes
of the divine spirit; therefore, we can only conceive and know of tl•c
soul by learning the powers or attributes of the spirit. When we have
learned them. we shall possess a cle:~r conception of tlte soul and its
real nature. In order to make ourselves better understood, let us illus-
trate the idea. Take a ray of light. What do we know concerning it?
THE SOUL 141
Nothing, except by its action upon something else. This action we
term the attributes of light. In themselves the attributes of light are
formless, but they may easily be rendered visible, either by their
colors when refracted by the prism, or by their effects when concen-
trated upon material objects. Here we have what may be correctly
termed the soul of a ray of light. Another example may be taken as
illustrative and expressive of the idea we wish to convey, viz.; the
organism of man. Man, as at present constituted, possesses five external
senses, viz.; seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting, and smelling. In reality,
he has seven senses which may be used externally, but the two higher
attributes of the sensuous gamut are still in embryo so far as the gen-
erality of mankind are concerned. The sixth race or atomic age child-
ren who are externalizing at the present time, will evolve the sixth
sense (intuition or perception through spiritual sensation, and learn
to use it in their daily lives); the seventh race will evolve the seventh
sense; and then mankind will be physically perfect. But as these two
higher senses need not interfere with our illustration, we will only
notice man as he is, and be content with five. All our knowledge con-
cerning external phenomena must come, at present, through the
mediumship of one or more of these senses. The organs through which
the functions of the senses become manifest are visible, but the senses
themselves are invisible and formless. We know them only as the
attributes of the body; while the mind, which is perfectly and abso-
lutely dependent upon the senses for information, well represents the
spiritual Ego in its r.elation to the soul.
The reader will observe from what is here stated, that the soul,
itself is, as before said, formless and intangible, and therefore can only
be defined as the attribute of spirit. The one cannot exist without the
other, but at the same time they cannot be called one and the same,
as there is the same difference between the two as there is between
a ray of light and its action; and the same distinction as there is be-
tween the body and its physical senses. Without the one we cannot
know the other, and vice versa.
A very large percentage of the readers of mystical literature have
imagined that the human soul is some kind of a spiritual organism,
similar in many respects to the body, and the means whereby the
divine spirit manifests itself. But, as shown, this idea is radically
erroneous. The spiritual body is the result or outcome of the soul's
142 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
action, but is not the soul itself. It is an attribute of the soul, just as
the soul is an attribute of the divine Ego, and this divine Ego, in its
turn, is a crystallized attribute or expression of Deity. What then is
Deity? the reader may ask. All that we are able to answer is, Abso-
lute Potentiality; pure, formless spirit; unlimited, unconditioned in-
telligence. Definition can go no further in this direction.
Having attempted to define the soul as distinct and yet insepar-
able from the spirit, we will now try to give some idea concerning its
attributes, and in this connection it will greatly aid us if we first
point out the difference between the soul and the body, and also the
correspondence.
The physical body is evolved by a reflex action of the interior
soul during the process of evolving its spiritual organism. The medium
between the two is the astral form or spiritual body. It is from the
latter that the physical body receives its form and force. The spiritual
organism protects itself, so to say, from the external plane by evolv-
ing an astral raiment. This raiment, or astral body, crystallizes a more
or less distorted reflection of the spiritual form around itself and
thus produces what is known as the human form divine, upon the
external plane. This physical organism is constituted and evolved in
such order as to render the most perfect expression (in unison) of the
physical senses. No one sense is in excess of another, in a perfectly
sound human organism; while the different animals generally typify
the extreme expression of some one particular sense, as sight, scent,
feeling, etc.
This human body, through the mediumship of the brain, which
is the sounding board of the senses, communicates with the external
world which is composed of various elements. The result is form,
sound, color, etc. Our senses, then, constitute the only source of our
external knowledge, and form the basis from which spring our ideas,
thoughts and feelings. Our thoughts are thus moulded by the various
phenomenal states through which we pass. This state is our external
consciousness. It is purely an intellectual state, based upon, and de-
pending upon the continuance of the physical senses while on earth.
The sum total of human knowledge upon special subjects is tabulated
and classified; this is reduced to a system and called science. We are
thus able to see and appreciate the relation of the physical senses to
the physical body, and grasp their importance to the still remoter
THE SOUL 143
mind which utilizes the knowledge so gained. The attributes of the
spirit, which we term the soul, bear a perfect correspondence to the
physical senses of the body. That is, the soul bears exactly the same
relation to the spirit as the physical senses bear to the human brain.
Thus we have the senses which are physical, and we have the senses
which are spiritual. The physical are simply a reflection of the spir-
itual. The senses of the body and the senses of the soul are two
halves of the same attribute, the external and the internal. We see
the intelligence, the mind, which at the back of the senses utilizes
and tabulates the impressions it receives of the outer world, the
world which it, itself, is powerless to penetrate. The mind is some-
thing above and beyond the senses, though it is absolutely dependent
upon them. It is the same with the soul, and the spirit. All knowl-
edge from without or within the universe of external life is received
by means of the soul. But at the back of this soul, there rests the
eternal scintillating atom of Deity above and beyond any human con-
ception. There it rests in serenity and peace, tabulating and utilizing
all the knowledge and experience which the soul in its various cycles'
is continually receiving. "As it is below so it is above." This law of
correspondences should ever be remembered. It is man's universal
but infallible guide, and anything conflicting therewith should be
rejected as erroneous.
The seven senses below correspond to the seven senses above,
and the sum total of the results obtained in each case is the same,
only upon different planes. These results may be fully expressed by
the word PERCEPTION. Absolute perception implies absolute con-
sciousness. Unlimited perception, therefore, is the grand goal toward
which the universe of manifested being is eternally marching. It
is the climax of evolution. But it is a goal that nothing below
Deity can ever attain, because there is always before us the in-
finite beyond, the awful states of the infinite unknown. The more
we learn, the more we learn the more there is to learn. Progressive
life is eternal; thus we have a complete demonstration of the immor-
tality of the spirit, and consequently, that of the soul, as the twain-
Bride and Bridegroom-are one.
We have now arrived at the last part of our subject, viz.; the
method of the soul's unfoldment or development. Of this we can
only speak in general terms. There are certain fundamental laws
144 TILE l.JCIIT OP ECYP'f
applicable to n.ll, but, to be sut-ccsslul, something more is requisite.
It is necessary lor each soul to follow a system specially adapted to
its special state. Each person must 6nd out for himself the special
development required of himo, unless he can come into contact with
others capable o£ reading his soul's requirements aright. H they can
give him the ni!Ces$ary information so much the better.
There is a trinity of laws to be observed; I. Physical harmony and
cleanliness in one's surroundings. II. ~!ental peace with clean
thoughts and freedom from worldly cares. Ill. Spiritual purity, and
complete isolation from impure currents of thought. Evolve these
states from within and the wilhout will take care of itself. Honest
desire (prayer) must be Srst. These are the methods or the soul's un-
foldment. Purity is the great touch-stone, and as Jesus has truly ob-
served, "Blessed arc the pure in heart for they shall see God." How
many can follow out such a c:ode? "Not one in a million." comes the
answer, vibrating across the •piritual spaces of Aether. And the sad-
dening thought that such is indPed the truth in this age, compels us
to indraw the spiritual forcc·s which the present discourse bas ex-
pended, and conclude with a few brief words of ft1endly advice.
To be pure in body, a putrc diet must be the menu and the high-
est form of food possible to man must constitute his physical suste-
nance. The products o£ the 1;oil are plenty; they are simple but suf-
ficient. Purity of mind demands clean thoughts. Wo cannot be perfect,
so let us be as perfect as our surroundings render possible. Learn to
say I will and I will not, then see thnt your assertion is sacredly main-
tained. Be honest with yours:clf.
Let us remember that tlw material life of man is only one second
of his existence, and thnt it i!l one of the most unprofitable things in
the world to he selfish. Se16shness is the road to the Hells of the soul
world. Evil on earth produc<'S suffering in the next worlcl as all oc-
counts must be balanced.
And, lastly, if theso things arc followed with an earnest loving
spirit, rest assured that the blossoms of the soul will expand into full-
grown Rowers. and for the l.abor and self-denial expended we shall
reap the spiritual rewards which will repay liS ten thousand fold. Re-
member, and realize, the words of the wise Procllls;-
"Xnow the Divinity that is within you that you may know the
Divine One, of which your S()ul is a ray."
CHAPTER II
MORALITY AND IMMORALITY
"Every soul is immortal by virtue of
its community with God."-Albertus Magnus.
In attempting to elucidate the problems of "Mortality and Im-
mortality," death and life, it must be understood that we are dealing
with questions that depend, in a very great measure, upon the con-
struction which is placed on the terms used. It is not our province to
enter into the scientific minutia of these problems, nor to present the
student with an abstract of learned nonsense concerning the various
derivations from which the words are supposed to have reached us.
Equally unimportant to our purpose is the sense in which our hoary
ancestors may have used them, seeing that such questions must ever
remain purely matters of speculation and opinion, and "when doctors
disagree, who shall decide?"
At present we are concerned with the Occult side of the prob-
lems, and with laws which are so far removed from the realms of mere
opinion as to constitute eternal realities; the manifestations of which
can be realized and verified by each individual soul for itself.
Simply and briefly stated, immortality means life, continued life;
mortality means death or the extinction of life, and therefore stands as
the antithesis of life and immortality. At least, such is the generally
accepted sense in which the words are now used. Mortality and im-
mortality in their external relation towards each other stand as polar
opposites, and as such they are the alpha and omega of cyclic exist-
ence. They represent "the evening and the morning" of every phase
of God's infinite creation, upon the outer planes of manifested being,
i.e., cosmic evolution. Life and death, then, form the grand spiral
axis of time, and its resultants to the human mind are seen in the
world of phenomena.
For the sake of convenience we will consider each problem by it-
self, and then, as a stimulant towards mental reflection, leave their
relationship to each other, to be thought out by each reader, separately,
for himself.
Mortality, as previously stated, means death and extinction upon
the material plane. But when viewed from the higher and more in-
146 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
terior standpoint, death simply means change of form and function.
There can be no absolute extinction in the strict sense of the term.
Atoms are immortal, eternal and indestructible; but a universe or an
organism which is composed of an infinite number of atoms, may be
dissolved, destroyed and forever lost, i.e., lost as an organic whole, but
not lost as regards its separate atomic parts. The mental being which
bound ·these atoms together loses its force during the process of
change or death, consequently death is simply change of polarity. In
order to see this, it must be understood that the moons, planets, suns
and systems have their own special individuality, exactly like animals
and men. On the contrary, an atom has no individuality, so far as its
external form is concerned, but it possesses a cosmic individuality, an
attraction and repulsion specially its own, by virtue of its differentia-
tion from the universal One. It is the complex expression of the
myriad atoms which compose the organism or the universe that con-
stitutes its individuality. This individuality gives expression to a form
suitable to its nature, and constitutes the personal or external appear-
ance. These facts must be borne in mind, or the real meaning of this
chapter will be misunderstood.
As a general principle of phenomenal expression, it may be said
that Nature embodies, within some external form, every idea, thought
and motive which mankind evolves. The only limit to her possibil-
ities in this direction is the mental and magnetic condition of the race.
In fact, every organic form that we see around us is Nature's expres-
sion of thou.ghts and ideas. These thoughts and ideas are representa-
tive of spiritual quaTities which react upon the astral light, and these
spiritual qualities emanate from Mind or mental being, either human
or divine.
As an illustration of the process of death, and change, let us select
two cases, one from the vegetable world, and one from the animal
kingdom;-a tree and a tiger. The tree dies, decay sets in, and very
soon it appears to be gone forever. But this disappearance is only an
illusion, for the tree not only exists but exerts a very powerful in-
fluence upon the material plane. The tree, so far as its phenomenal
outcome is concerned, has only been a means by which the progressive
cycle of evolution works upward from the mineral state. It is composed
of millions of atoms of life undergoing their various cyclic rounds
within the vegetable circuit, and as a natural consequence of this in-
MORTALITY AND IMMORTALITY 147
ternal spiritual activity the tree possesses a karmic sphere within the
astral spaces of its life wave. The astral tree, if we may so call this
karmic counterpart, is far more beautiful in its wonderful details, and
more perfect in its symmetry and geometrical proportions than the
physical tree of earth. When the material tree no longer exists as a
living earthly organism, the arboreal image within Nature's wonder-
ful laboratory becomes the means of reflecting the outlines of a still
more perfect vegetable organism upon the outward planes of mat-
ter. These outlines of astral skeletons of future trees possess the at-
tractive force which draws within them the living germs of the young
seedlings growing upon the earth. This action feeds the physical tree,
then goes to lower forms.
The greatest perfection of one tree becomes impressed within the
astral light and becomes the means of developing a more perfect or-
ganism of its kind in the next generation. The ideal of the tree becomes
externalized in its offspring.
The trained psychic, and those who naturally possess spiritual
lucidity, can see this ethereal vegetation within the astral world.
Therefore, proofs of the two planes of existence may be quickly ob-
tained, should they ever be required. The internal plane is more
alive than the external, but to resume. The physical tree disappears,
but does not die as we suppose. When physical death transpires it
undergoes a change; the sphere of its activities become translated, re-
moved from the external to the internal, in strict obedience to the
higher laws of its internal nature. Thus we see that the tree, having
served its purpose on earth, vanishes from external sight, while its
ethereal counterpart performs another cycle upon a higher plane.
When each has fulfilled its purpose the various evolving atoms which
constituted its life form, obeying the interior laws of their cyclic
round, seek re-incarnation. They separate and the cycle is complete.
The individual tree no longer exists as a tree. But there has been no
death in any case; only a change of form; for the atomic forces of
the tree re-appear upon a higher plane in a million varying forms
throughout every department of N·ature.
Having considered death in regard to the tree, let us now exam-
ine, in the animal kingdom, the case of the tiger. We have already
stated that Nature ever strives to externalize ideas and thoughts in
some form or other. This statement. must be borne in mind. The
us Til€ LICI IT OV ECYI'T
tiger presents us with n fino illustration of tllis law of transformation
upon the outward planes of existence.
We all know what d1c tiger is \vhen endowed with physical life.
His chief qualities nrc selfishness and tlcstroctivcocss. He is, in fact,
a complete expression of cruelty. When death transpires, the astral
tiger, like the astral tree, becomes indrawn witl>in the karmic sphere
of its astral world. There ~ performs the higher evolutions of its
special round until the life atoms, which constitute it, become "rounded
out" and ready to C<tcrnaUzc in some higher form. Thus the tiger,
like the tree, is one of :-/aturc·s countless mediums for the expression
of mental force. lly the inttfior laws of its constitution, it forms a
central vortex or focus for the materialization of the purely selfish and
destructive elements of humanity. When deatl1 removes the physical
tiger from earth, the ethereal tiger becomes the sphere of action un-
til the tigerish qualities have run their cycle. But we cannot say that
there has been any real extinction, or that death has come upon the
tiger, any more than we can say that the caloric of the sunbe-.tm is
de.<troyed beenuse the solar ray is no longer brought to a focus. The
eye of the initiate can distinctly sec the ferocity of U1e animal in t11e
inhumanity of the man.
Mortality o•
· death, then, can only exist and be a truth in refer·
cncc to individual forms. lt has no existence in reality when brought
face to face with the spiritual qualities and mental force, which
created these forms. Chango of sphere and change of action are the
only realities of death. Evca
· onwurd, ever upward, forever and ever
more. Eternal progression is the anthem of evolution, and the cycles
of action arc but intervals of time measured out to the life forces by
the pendulum of CI'Cntion.
The second portion of our subject "'Immortality" is the polar op-
posite of death and mortnli:y. Individual forms and characteristics
nrc the only things that change and die. Death, as we have shown,
is not c.xtinction of the life atoms in the literal sense of the term, but
simpl)• change of sphere and function. Death is the grand tenninus of
one cycle of existence, and the commencement of another. ~fortality
is the harbinger o£ a still higher state of life, and consequently the
forerunner of immortality. ':'here are exceptions to the general rule.
though they arc few. The most important of these exceptions we shall
notice in our next chapter.
MORTALITY AND IMMORTALITY 149
There are two distinct phases of immortal life, viz.: conscious
immortality, and unconscious immortality. One relates to mind, and the
other to matter; one to intelligence, and the other to substance.
There is only one grade of external.life which can be said to in-
herit immortality in the Occult sense of the term. This grade includes
those souls who are truly human who have soul qualities of such high
degree that they can advance. Not as we know and recognize indi-
viduals, but, rather, an individuality consisting entirely of soul qual-
ities, a purely spiritual state which can only be partially expressed by
the use of words. All the states below the human plane are only so
many radiating lines which converge to a point, and are brought to
a focus within the human organism. Therefore, every quality and
force upon the planet or within the system of which the organism
forms a part must find expression within man, this uterus of Nature.
If this were not so, man would not constitute a miscrocosm or uni-
verse in miniature. In the grades below the human state, we do not
find complete organisms. They are mere temporary shapes of mat-
ter continually dying out of existence, when the forces they were
evolved to express are exhausted, and thus give place to something
more perfect. They are not souls in the true sense, but refracted at-
tributes of souls. They are qualities and functions in the process of
evolution; isolated parts and characteristics of a whole; organs, but
not organisms.
Commencing at the very lowest point of animated existence, we
shall discover only the most rudimentary expression of the simplest
functions of organic life, viz.: a desire to live. As we ascend higher
the organs become multiplied, and the desire to live increases. This
gradual scale expands right up to the perfect human soul in man,
where we find a miniature universe, absolute and complete within
itself. The central Deific atom, controlling this universe, has traveled
all the way up from the lowest crude fire rocks of cosmic evolution.
It conquered every state through which it ascended upon its progres-
sive, toilsome journey. And in each state evolved from within itself
a complete attribute corresponding to the state, by virtue of which,
it polarized and bound the atoms of life, and annexed them as a por-
tion of its spiritual empire, thereby forming the means for their
progression also. Until, at last, the Deific atom sits upon the spiritual
throne as king of the microcosm, capable of thinking, creating and
evolving from within itself the glorious states of the angel.
150 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
It is, therefore, an Occult truth to declare that all things below
man are mortal, and all above immortal. Man, alone, of all God's
marvelous creations, contains within himself the forces of life and
death, of immortality and mortality. Man, then, contains "the prom-
ise and potency of life" and constitutes, upon the spiritual plane, what
Tyndall's protoplasm does upon the physical, viz.: the possibilities of
infinite progression.
To attain unto immortality it is necessary, as we have shown, for
the central life atom to conquer every state below the human, and
then to become externalized upon earth as an individual human being,
to undergo the trials and become subjected to the responsibilities of a
conscious, reasoning, individual struggle for life. The nature and qual-
ity of the soul, combined with the polarity of the organism, will launch
the individual into the exact conditions and circumstances that
are best adapted to arouse all the latent qualities within; both animal
and human. It is not a previous karma that determines an individual's
condition in life, but it is the nature and quality of the soul conflicting
or harmonizing with external conditions. This turmoil of life, this
ceaseless human warfare, is just as necessary for the soul's final de-
velopment as are the earlier struggles through the states below. Man
possesses the possibilities of immortal life in such a potent degree as
to nearly always succeed. There are, however, a few solitary excep-
tions which will be noted in the next chapter.
After man has passed through the travail of human life he then
meets the struggle o~ his karma in the realm of spirit. Here he may
even sink forever, because he does not actually possess immortality,
only the promise or possibility of it. After the four realms of the as-
tral world are passed he enters the sixth state of the soul world, where
he should become re-united with his soul mate, his missing half. Until
this union is complete there is and can be no actual immortality.
Previous to this he is but a part of himself, and has control only of
half of his spiritual nature. It is the union of the two that forms the
absolute one. "And they twain shall be one flesh," saith the old Jewish
Scripture; "as it is above, so it is below."
From the foregoing it will be seen that it is the reunion of the
twin souls in the realm of spirit that confers upon man the state of
angelhood. He is human no longer, he is then Divine, and as a Deific
being he possesses the attributes of eternal progression and immortal
life.
CHAPTER III
THE DARK SATELLITE
When we look about us with the physical senses, Nature seems to
be in continual warfare with herself. In fact, it seems utterly impos-
sible to find anything not in deadly conflict with something else, either
visible or invisible. Observing this, mankind has unconsciously, from
time immemorial, formulated the idea of two great powers, viz., "good"
and "evil". From this idea the grand dogma of theology-"God" and
the "Devil" sprang into existence, and became the chief comer stone
of every sacerdotalism which the world has witnessed. And while
there is some basic truth in this idea, as in every popular conception,
since mankind as a whole cannot formulate any idea that is wholly
and absolutely false in every detail; yet, there is also much that is
utterly false in it, owing to the fact that man, while existing upon the
material plane, cannot grasp the divine idea of Absolute Truth, nor
realize the logical absurdity of more than one Absolute. He, there-
fore, utterly fails to comprehend how that which is relative evil can
be harmonized into absolute good. Accordingly, to the majority of
mankind, this mighty problem of good and evil is still unsolved. Few,
very few indeed, even of the profoundly learned students of Occult
lore in the past, arrived at a true conception of the subject.
During the lapse of the ages, countless legends and allegories
have been evolved, to embody the facts and the processes connected
with this arcane mystery, but the metaphysics of these legends have
never been revealed to the uninitiated. Especially has this been the
case in regard to the Dark Satellite. However, the time has now come
when certain facts in regard to this orb of evil are for the first time
given out to the world "pro bono publico."
In the first place, certain misconceptions in regard to the dark
orb need to be corrected. Many earnest students have thought it to be
"The Lost Orb" of the Grecian mysteries, hence similar to the
Egyptian conception of the spiritual "fall". But there is, in fact, no
connection between the two. The lost orb, in its cosmological aspect,
will be found noticed in the second part of this work. In its spiritual
aspect it applies to the fallen human soul, not the lost soul. Herein
consists the difference between the two orbs, the lost and the dark.
152 TH£ LIC.HT Ot· 'ECYI'r
Another misconception has regarded the ~loon, our Earth's ,·is·
ible s:~teUite, as identical wid> the dark orb. Many Theosophists as-
sert, in a very mysterious manner, that the Moon is not only the eighth
sphere, or the orb of death and dissolution, but that it is "the dust bin
of the universe," although Dr. Wyld, formerly president of the London
T.S. fully exposed the absurdity of tl>
is mysterious Theosophical Se-
cret in the columns of "Light." This conception is radicnll)• false as
regards the Moon, although i: approaches the realms of tmth in some
rcsJ)(lcts rcgMding the nature of the mysterious dnrk satellite itself.
With thc.•c brief introductory remarks it now remains to point
out how to form a perfectly correct conception of what the dal"k
satellite is, and its fearful importance at the pl"cscnt crisis of th~
world's history.
When the student bring; bdore his mind tho teachings of the
preceding chapters, and the conclusions they lend up to, considering
them ns a whole, it will require but a brief and eMcful application of
the laws of correspondences to enable him to gain a perfectly accnratt'
idea of tllis hitherto concealed region and portion of the Earth's cnn-
stitution.
By referring to the "Hermetic Constitution of ~ fan" as elucidated
in chapter II of section li of the present work, let tho student revit
'w
the seven dh•isions of man, then, bc.•ring in mind the fact that th<-
planPt which man inhahits is also an individuAl, posscssin~ a sevC'n·
fold constitution correspondir.g in every respect to the constitution of
mnn, let him strictly npply the Herrnetic law for himself,
'•As it is below. so It 1$ (1hovc•.
As on tl1c cnrth, so in the ~"y."
Then, he will know exactly how to go to work to comprehend the
subject. 13ut os the Ol"dinary student, living wholly upon tho external
plane, is not in n position to verify his conccpllons, he must co11tent
himself for the present to accept the revelations which will be made
upon the authority of those " flo do know, and have vcrlfled the truth.
In chapter II of section II of this work "Hermetic Constihttion of
llfan," occurs a description o: the animal soul, ns it is called. Now,
that mognetie sphere of our planet whidt exactly corresponds to the
animal soul of mnn, is what is Occultl)• terrned "the Dock Satellite."
Therefore, in order to comprehend this dusky <pher<-. its nahne and
functions, it is absolutely neces.<ary to understand the nnhn<- and fun<>
lion nf the animal soul of man. together with its r<-lntions to th<' t>ther
TilE DARJ( SATt:LLlTE 153
six divisions; and also, to clearl>• grasp man's relation to the planet of
which he forms, as it were, an atomic part towards an organic whole.
When the above is understood, it will then be seen that this
dark, magnetic orb constitutes the grand center or focus of the Earth's
animal force; in other words, it is the realm of the undeveloped good
in Nahlr(', whose t~rrible mo:to is embra<:ed in the word SELF.
During the "Golden" aoc "Silver" periods of our Earth's evolution,
this da•
·k satellite was in the aphelion portion of ils orbit and its in-
flucuco wns scarcely felt; or else, its inAucncc wns seen and recognized
only in its true relation of animal force and undeveloped good. i\s a
factor of evil it was impercet>lible. But during the Copper and Iron
ages the dnrk satellite gradually approached the Earth, and its de-
grading forces became more and more bewildering and potent until
tho year 188t, when it passed its grand perihelion point. The year
1881 was to sec the second c:>ming of the Lord. Many sects expected
Jesus to come in person, select their group as the chosen few, guide
them to heaven and leave aUothers on earth to suffer their fate because
of their sins and non-belief. ':"his proved to be a real error. The usher-
ing in of new spiritual thought and the new atomic age is actually tbc
new dispensation, the second corning of Christ. Wars are necessary
to bring about the change, the old must be uprooted before the new
can take its place. The dark qrb is now slowly but surely receding,
and although the clouds are not lifted from the mental' horizon; and
though the fearful world-wide conflicts which occurr~'(l nrc not >•et
settled; nnd confusion and chaos seem 1nOI'O widespread and error
more nunpnnt than ever before in the world's history, yet the crisis is
past its dnrkest culminating point. As it is often darke•t just before
break of clny, so even now the dawn of a brighter morn is at hand,
when the faithful, resolute trJth-sceker shall be able to solve for him·
self this awful problem of goxl and evil, ol light nnd shadow. There-
fore, sustained by the knowledge of the ultimate victory of order and
equilibrium over chaos and opposing forres; even though all mankind
ar<' enveloped in the darl-ne.s of battle and involved in the vortices
of the defeated legions of error; let us turn our attention more closely
to the satellite itself, which has been such a disturbing factor to our
plnnct"s mental equilibrium; and consider this sphc~ with special
reference to the implications of rcsponsihility forced upon ev('r}' SOul
seeking light and immortality.
154 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
In the first place, this orb possesses a complete organization of its
own; and is governed by well defined laws, the nature of which may
be known only too well by patiently observing the merciless instincts
of the lower animal nature as manifested in man; where the moral
consciousness is absolutely wanting. Our daily news, continually,
reports all sorts of vicious crimes against God and man. Throughout
the whole of this loathsome sphere are numerous races of spiritual
beings; many of them possessing the highest forms of cunning ·and
intelligence possible to the animal plane. It is these creatures; who
are neither elementals nor elementaries, but treacherous beings; who
produce the greatest portion of the suffering and misery which afHicts
humanity. They are the active Occult agents of that potent fraternity
within the spiritual world which has its external expression and cor-
respondence in the brotherhood known upon Earth as the "Black
Magi," or "Inversive Brethren." These two fraternities, viz: the spirit-
ual rulers and potentialities of the dark satellite upon the astral plane,
and the schools of Black magic, vice and crime, upon the physical
plane; constitute the two halves of the planet's evil desire.
From within the dark center of the astral realms of the former,
the spirit of lies, murder, crime, fraud and religious imposture is
first formulated, and then projected to the earthly fraternity as the
means of its continued existence. From these centers it is re-formu-
lated to suit the spirit and temper of the times; and then its psycho-
logical influence is projected into the mental whirl of the race,
where its silent, subtle influx poisons the dimensional spaces which
constitute the magnetic planes of human life. From thence, these
unseen Occult currents penetrate the innermost recesses of the
human mind, and possess the soul to such an extent, that deep
down in the heart of man; no matter how pure and disinterested
he may appear; there lurks the slimy reptile of selfishness, yea,
even when he least suspects it. It is this grim monster, SELF, that
each aspirant to Occult truth seeks to conquer. When this Goliath
of the soul is struck dead by the smooth white pebble of the spirit,
slung with the neophyte's will, the grand ordeal is over, the crown
of immortality won. "To the victor belong the spoils."
We have pointed out the fact that it is the dark satellite from
whence proceeds the spirit of lies, murder and frauds. This was
well known to the initiates of the greater Hermetic mysteries, for
THE DARK SATELLITE 155
we find the idea very clearly defined in the mystical language of
the ancients, as the following extract from one of the supposed lost
magical works of Hermes Trismegistus will show. Speaking of the
magical rulers of the dark satellite as they sit in council, creating
delusion, we read:
"So they called forth a form
From the deep dark abyss
To embody their evil desire."
"Obedient it came
From the realms of the dead,
Arrayed in its magic attire."
"As it passed o'er the earth
The fair flowers fell dead,
From its breath of poisonous £re."
Indeed, so thoroughly has this poisonous fire of self-interest
permeated the world, that the fair flowers of disinterestedness have
become an almost entirely extinct species, and should the real state
of unselfish, unworldliness of a true mystic become known, he is
either regarded with pity as non compos mentis, or else looked
upon with suspicion as an imposter, acting from motives more subtle
than govern the ordinary mortal.
The manner in which this poisonous magnetic energy is pro-
jected from the dark satellite to the earth is wholly inversive, and
the rulers and magical hierophants make use of this inversive force
to distort and corrupt Truth in every form wherein it struggles to
become manifest upon earth. The powers and influences attributed
to certain races of astrals, by the authors of "The Perfect Way,"
belong in reality to the rulers and principalities of the dark satellite,
who mercilessly distort every arcane truth into theological dogma,
of partial error, causing it to assume to the human mind the delusive
form of the externals of truth and logic. But the delusive form is,
after all, only a very flimsy sophistry when subjected to the keen
searching eye of the soul. Consequently, it is always those who are
half informed of Nature's mysteries; the half-initiated, so to say;
who fall into the snare. Herein is seen the Occult truth in the
proverb, "A little learning is a dangerous thing."
Just as the dark satellite was at its perihelion, these inversive
brethren achieved the greatest apparent theological and metaphysical
success in the re-launching forth, throughout the world, of the doc-
trines of "Re-incarnation," "Karma," and "Disembodied Shells," as
156 THE LJCJJT OF F.CYP'r
formulated and taught by tlte decaying priesthoods of the dreamy
Orient. Viewed in its true light, this gigantic movement of the
inversive brethren was aimed as a death blow to the rapidly spreading
spiritualism of the Occident; since, wherever accepted, these doc-
trines, as taught and interpreted by the Buddhist cult, destroy at
once, all belief in the possibility of spirit communication between
disembodied souls and external humanity. Such a movement, how-
ever, is doomed to ultimate fa.ilm·c, ns there are certain absolute
truths connected with spiritualism that wilJ live, notwithstanding
the ignorance of the expounders, its many errors and gross im-
postures. These truths can neither be suppressed by inversive magic,
nor smothered by an oriental theory. Their misrepresentations are
too patent to the candid mind, and reaction against the spceulative
mentality of the East, sooner or later, is sure to set in. The Western
matter-of-fact mind, will tear the grim mask from these would-be
brethren of the snow-clad Himalayas, and show to the world who
are the denizens of the shadow, and who are the children of light.
At this point the question na~mally arises, "of what personal
or selfish benefit is the propagatiO
n of error to the inhabitants of
the dark satellite?" The answer is simply this, it furnishes them with
the means of prolonging their external existence while on earth,
and supplies them with an addition"! lease or life in the world to
come; as will be made manifest from the Hermetic laws or death
given below. Aceording to llennetic laws, death is not what is
known as physical, dissolution, but is a failure on the part of the
human being to polarize the atoms which constitute his soul so he
may realize immortality. It is, therefore, a falling from the h\lman
plane to the animal plane, where conscious existence mny be pro-
longed inde6nitely by means of dark magica1 arts.
The following arc an accurate rendering of the real ideas as
taught hy Hermes Trismegistus.
n n:: t..AWS OF DEATH
I. "As it is below, so it is ahovei as on the earth, so in the sky."
II. "There are two states of being; one is mortal, the other is
immortal."
III. "That which is mortal is dissolvable, and dissolvable bodi<"s
pas-s away like a mist in the morning."
TilE DARK SATELLITE 157
IV. "An immortal body is an essence which is eternal and
incorruptible."
V. "But the twain, the mortal and the immortal, cannot exist
together forever, but each returneth to the place from whence it
"
came.
VI. "The mortal body is sensible, but the immortal is reasonable."
VII. "The former contains nothing that is perfect, the latter
nothing that is imperfect; for the one is the essence of the matter,
and the other the essence of spirit, and man, the microcosm, holds the
balance of the twain."
VIII. "And there is a fierce warfare for the victory, between
the lower and the upper, as they both desire to obtain the body as
their prize; for the state of man is envied by the lower and glorified
as a noble state by the higher."
IX. "Now if the man inclines toward the lower nature which
is mortal, he thereby aids the lower imperfect powers to oppose the
higher which is immortal, and must suffer the pains of slavery for
his disobedience to the Work-Man, his maker. But if he inclines to
the higher, then he is truly wise and blest."
X. "Should man, after being attracted by the vanities of the
world and then, after obtaining a knowledge of the things that are,
return to the vanities of the world, he will be punished with torments
and fire in the darkest states of disembodied souls."
XI. "Should a man after knowing the things that are become
rebellious of restraint to that part which is immortal, and return to
the vanities of the world, the higher essence will straightway depart
from him, and he will become the slave of the lower essence which
will seize upon him and drive him to all sorts of wicked arts and
evil ways."
XII. "When man has thus impiously disobeyed his Creator
and turned his face away from that which is immortal, behold, he
is then disinherited from his birthright, and is no longer counted
among the children of God, because he has become an evil, perverse
thing, possessing only those things which are mortal, and he is
punished with death."
XIII. "And so death is meted out to all those who rebel against
their Creator impiously, because they know the things that are. But
to those foolish souls who are ignorant, and who have not knowingly
158 THE LIGHf OF EGYPT
rejected their Creator, behold, they are purified after much sufFering
and are sent to the world again."
The teachings involved in the above laws are so clear, so simple,
and we may also add so divinely just, that to attempt in any way to
explain or annotate them would only be to sow the first seeds of
error and misunderstanding. We will, therefore, leave them with
the reader as they are, pure and free from the mental bias of any
mortal being.
In a previous chapter we have shown that all realms of life
above the human are immortal, and that those below this plane
are mortal, or, they only possess the possibilities of immortality in
a rudimentary form. Man, alone, possesses the elements of both life
and death. The laws of life have also been fully elucidated, and the
soul which even only imperfectly obeys them will, "after it has
been purified by much suffering," ultimately reap the reward of
eternal conscious existence. Consequently, the great majority of
those souls who are really human beings, will inherit immortality
as the natural consequence of their humanity. But there are exceptions,
which though few in number, comparatively, require special notice.
These exceptions may, for the sake of convenience, he divided into
three distinct classes. The first and most numerous class consists
of imperfectly organized, sensitive, weak-natured individuals, with
little or no mental bias, who possess strong mediumistic magnetisms.
Individuals of this class, though perfectly human to begin with,
soon lose the actual control of the external organism, and in conse-
quence, the body becomes the obedient instrument for any and
every class of disembodied earth bound spirits, or, what is still
worse, it may become the slave of some vicious elementary. In this
case there was no real or true individuality to start with, therefore,
no one can assert truthfully that he was actually acquainted with
the true personage; for, most probably the real soul had departed in the
very early infancy of the organism's physical existence, how, when,
or where, none but the trained seer can tell. In every individual case
the astral causes that produced the soul's abortion will differ widely.
The second class are those who fall victims to premeditated
obsession, and are by no means so numerous as the former. In this
case the organism is generally very fine, so far as the magnetic
temperament is concerned, but the soul is utterly wanting in spiritual
..
THE DARK SATELLITE 159
volition or will. That is to say, the magnetic polarity is of such a
nature that the spiritual will of the soul is almost powerless to act
upon it. The absence of this essential element of human life may
be the result of mental conditions of the mother during pregnancy,
or of a mental coma, so to say, of both parents at the moment of
conception. This mental coma externalizes itself in the offspring as
a lack of vim, nerve and fire. Hence, we often see this condition
manifested in the children of kings, noblemen, and those of great
wealth, who have the means to pander to and gratify a fashionable,
sentimental lassitude. In addition to this lack of spiritual volition,
the magnetic constitution is always strongly mediumistic and the
individual, if left quite free from the control of others, naturally
would be good, highly sensitive, and in the true sense of spiritual
parlance, "a spirit medium," inspirational, physical, or clairvoyant,
according to his peculiar magnetic grade. This is the reason why
they often fall the victim of premeditated obsession. When obsession
transpires it is generally found that some potent external mind,
that of an evil sorceress, or black magician, (according to the sex,)
requires the organism for the purpose of prolonging their own personal
existence. When a suitable mediumistic body is found, they bring
the whole of their powerful magnetic will to bear upon the almost
willess brain of their victim, and slowly but surely eject the rightful
occupant, and then, by virtue of their Occult powers and magic
arts, inhabit the organism themselves, while the near friends and
relatives of the victim are often surprised at the remarkable change
which they notice has taken place, in temperament and disposition,
but alas,-they seldom or never suspect the terrible truth which
such a change implies, nor can they possibly be brought to fully
understand that the individual moving among them as usual has
nothing whatever in common with their silently departed friend.
The third and last, also the least in number, of these classes
includes those who are born into the world under strangely con-
flicting conditions. They possess all the essential elements of manhood
with a powerful current of the most potent and concentrated form
of selfishness and pride. In addition to this undesirable quality
they express the highest form of intellectuality combined with a
powerful will and mediumistic temperament. These dominating
conditions predispose them to the study of psychology and Occultism,
160 n-m IJCIrr OF ECYl'T
hence they fall an easy prey to the members of the Black Magi
and their inversive astral Brethren. Their selfishness, combined with
tlleir unbounded ambition and desire for power, precipitate them
headlong into the most frightful practices,· where, surrounded by
the infernal rites of their diabolical seducers, they become the
helpless slaves of the very powers they sought to control. Hence-
forward, they are lost. As the Hermetic law states, "They are punished
with death," and they know it, and consequently are compelled,
for their own safety, to remain faithful to the order which entrapped
them. Their only motto is self, their only desire is to live, and this
they wiU do at any cost. For their own single lives they would
S3criBce the balance of God's creation, if such a thing were possible,
simply because death to them is death iD reality.
In the first and second classes of so·called lost souls, the true
individual, as we have shown, does not become lost, he is "the
foolish," ignorant soul, "sent to the world again." Not sent to the
world again by means of re-incarnation in matter upon the outward
planes of life, but by a sympathetic union with some kindred soul
on earth, whose experiences they can experience, whose sorrows
they can feel, and whose joys they can share. The writer has beheld
numerous cases of this kind, where the soul of some unfortunate,
mediumistic organism was sympathetically attached to the organism
of a living individual, as a means of progress, and of completing
this round of external experiences. In this class a person simply
loses his physical organism. This personality, along with the animal
and astral portion of it, becomes a lifeless shadow at death, and
slowly disintegrates within the magnetic spaces of the astral light.
It is a misty forrn, incapable of personating its original owner, or
of being "galvanized into temporary life." While the counterfeiting,
obsessing forces, after loss of the physical body run the cycle of
the magneUc existence within the electro-vital spaces of the planet,
then become attached to the eighth sphere, the Dnrk Satellite or
orh of death. This attraction is brought into force by virtue of
their affinity with the realms of elemental being. They have sunk
beneath the plane of humanity, and consequently are no longer
human, and when once they become enclosed within the fatal
magnetic whirl of death, they lose the polarity over the feeble
atoms which constitute their only being, and gradually dissolve,
TilE DARK SATELLITE 161
atom by atom, like the poisonous miasmatic mists before the rising
sun. While the Deific Atoms themselves, which these lost personalities
failed to realize, imperishable as ever, enter upon a new cycle of
involution and evolution, thus slowly building up new individualities
for themselves. Not on this planet, the scene of their failure and
suffering, but on a higher plane, in worlds more ethereal than ours.
CHAPTER IV
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP
Having considered the failure of what might be termed the
human-animal soul, in the preceding chapter, we now come to the
triumph of the human soul over the forces of matter, known as
adeptship. This subject furnishes a fitting terminus to the first part
of our mystical studies, in which we have included, though briefly,
every important section of Occult science embraced within "the lesser
mysteries" of Nature.
The triumph of the human soul over the forces of matter, termed
adeptship, does not refer to the attainment of immortality; since,
as previously stated, the vast majority of mankind inherit immor-
tality as the result of their humanity; although this is not completely
assured until they have passed through the sixth state of the soul
world. In this chapter we refer to those rare embodied human beings
who are so· organized and circumstanced as to be able to evolve
the sixth and seventh states of consciousness; or, in other words,
those who have the inborn ability to attain to the powers and blessings
of their immortality, while yet living outwardly, upon the human
plane of embodied existence.
The literary world has been flooded with descriptions and
explanations of adeptship. Definitions have even been attempted of
the various degrees and grades of this exalted state; but so far, nearly
all of such would-be expounders of states higher than themselves
have (with one or two exceptions) failed most completely; for :the
very simple reason that, no human being can describe the nature
and condition of a higher spiritual state of life than that to which
his own spiritual nature has attained. Only two grades of individuals,
therefore, can really describe adeptship. One is the adept himself,
and the other is his accepted neophyte, his future successor, who
has passed the third initiation, and is, thenceforward, in perfect
magnetic rapport with the master to whose state he is to succeed
when that master ascends unto a still higher sphere of spiritual life
and power.
To those real seekers of esoteric knowledge who aspire to know
Truth, irrespective of the source, or claims of any literary or learned
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP 163
worldly authority, we offer the following elucidation of adeptship.
It comes from one who has actually passed through the various
realms and states of spiritual existence, necessary for the acquisition
of such knowledge. Therefore, his statements are the result of personal
experiences within the world of spirit. And should the writer be blindly
charged with contradicting the previous teachings of the modem
Theosophical authorities upon the subject; he desires to point out
the fact that, very few (if any) of them are entitled to explain the lofty
state they would set forth.
If they do not know of their own experience, their descriptions
are mostly inference and surmise, rather than conscious knowledge.
In order to present the subject as clearly as possible to the
student, we will consider first, the various grades of adeptship; second,
the nature and functions of adeptship; and third, how adeptship is
attainable.
I THE VARIOUS GRADES OF ADEPTSHIP
In the first place, there are three distinct grades of this exalted
state, each grade containing within itself three separate states or
degrees of life and power, so that in the whole there are nine states
of Wisdom. These principle grades may be designated, in general
terms, as the natural, the spiritual and the celestial states, of the
soul's progressive evolutions. The first, the most external state, relates
to the world of physical phenomena, and deals exclusively with the
elemental spheres of the planet, and the astra-magnetic currents which
control them. The powers of the adept of this grade extend from
the elemental zones of matter in the world of effects, up to the astra-
magnetic spheres in the realm of cause. "Beyond this astral world
they become powerless. Hence, their highest achievements are within
the realms of external magnetic phenomena."
The second grade, which constitutes the interior or spiritual
state of the first, relates to the realm of spirit, and deals exclusively
with the spiritual and ethereal forces of the planet. The adepts of
this grade are the translated souls of those who have graduated
through the various degrees of the first. As such, they fulfill the duties
of the master or tea.cher to those who are still graduating in the outer
degrees of spiritual :!.ife. Their power extends from the magnetic zones
of the astral world up to the ethereal and spiritual spheres of dis-
embodied humanity. Beyond these states of spirihwl life they cannot
lfl.l TilE LJCHT OF ECYPT
penetrate, hence, their highest achievements are within the spheres
of disembodied existence. Occupying as they do, the interior degree
of life, they are enabled to combat the hells, on t11e one hand, and to
sustain the heavens, on the other. These spiritual adepts cannot
descend to earth (as we understand the term) and manife.t their
power externally, without the aid of a properly trained instrument,
whose odylie sphere they con temporarily o'-cupy. Their chief means
of communication with the external world are the adepts of the exterior
grade, through whom they transmit such portions of spiritual truth
as tile world has need of.
The third grade constitute. the internal or cele5tial state of the
second; and is the highest degree of spiritual life that the embodied
human mind coo comprehend; and relates to the higher states of
purilled souls. It is above and beyond what we know as the human.
It is angellc and celestial in nature. Of its Dei6c powers and potenti-
alities we can not speak. They are beyond the grasp of e.•ternal llfe.
At this point, it is or the utmost importance that the student
should clearly grasp the relation of these three grades to each other,
in order to form a correct idea of the nature and functions of adeptship,
and also, in order to understand by what means it may be attained.
The first grade and tl>c three degrees included therein embrace
aU the possibilities of humanity under the external conditions of the
present cycle; for, beyond the limited possibilities of tile "Life Wave"
not even the adept, heir elect of tile angels, though he be, can
transcend. The various astral spaces which mark off the limits of
these human possibilitie-~. constitute the boundary line of Nature
drawn by the finger of Deity between the two worlds of human
life, 'the natural and the spiritual. When the external life mission
of an adept o( the Grst grade is fu!Blled, a process analogou$ to
physical dissolution transpires; the physical atoms which constitute
his organism arc liberated and the exalted soul enters upon a higher
state of evolution and life, and becomes the spiritual man or an
adept of the second grade. The second grade is thus a continuation
of the first, upon a higher and more interior plane, and the scene
of the soul's activity is transferred from the astral and magnetic
spheres to the realm of spirit. This state hold$ the grand key of life
and death, wherein all the greater mysteries of external life arc
concealed. Tt also stands midway between the man and the angel,
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP 165
and thus presents to us the equipoise between the human and the
divine.
From the lowest grade of the human being on the external
planes of matter up to the highest grade, or the perf~ct man, there
are seven states; so, also, in the realm of spiritual humanity, there
are seven states from the perfect man up to the angel. The vast
importance of this grade of life, or spiritual adeptship, is also manifest
from the fact, that, it is upon the boundaries of the sixth and seventh
state of this grade, that, the two halves of the divine soul become
permanently and eternally united. The twin souls, male and female,
when united, then constitute the complete whole of the divine Ego.
This mystical union is "the marriage of the Lamb" of Saint John,
wherein the man becomes the angel, the human becomes divine,
and enters upon the unknown cycles of Deific life. He is the grand
angelic hierophant of celestial mysteries; the nature, power and
function of which, are too transcendent for the comprehension of
embodied mankind.
II THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF ADEPTSHIP
In passing to this branch of our subject we shall deal only with
the first grade, or. adeptship of the external degree; since, before it
is possible for the student to fully comprehend the powers of the
second, he must himself attain unto the first grade. Therefore, to
avoid any misconception, let it be distinctly understood that the
whole of what now follows pertains exclusively to that state of
adeptship whose members live, move, and have their being, and
launch forth their powers, either upon the external planes of physical
life, or else within the spheres of the astral world immediately
interior to it.
Since the adept is the perfect man, it is evidently necessary
for us to comprehend what is the nature of his perfection, in what
does it consist? We have already fully explained, that, in the Occult
sense of the term, man is a composite being possessing a seven-fold
constitution, having seven cyclic states of existence; that is to say,
progressive states of evolution upon the physical plane. The perfect
man, therefore, is he who evolves in full his composite being and
attains unto the seven states, while yet existing in external physical
conditions. While on the other hand, the ordinary human being is
166 THE LLGHT OF EGYPT
compelled to attain whatever he lacks of perfection after he leaves
his physical body, within the purgatorial states of purification of
the soul world. Ignorance and selfishness; or else, the jarring discords
produced by the combination of the two; force the great majority
of mankind out of the central line of march mapped out by progressive
evolution. At the present time, mankind has evolved but five physical
senses. A few sensitive souls are aware of the higher two, but are not
able to make much use of them. The perfect composite man possesses
not only seven physical senses, but also seven soul senses, related to
each other as follows:
PHYSICAL
SENSES SouL SENSES
1. Touch 1. The power to psychometrize
2. Taste 2. The power to absorb and enjoy the finer
essence of the life wave
3. Smell 3. The power to distinguish
aromas of Nature
the spiritual
4. Sight 4. The lucid state called clairvoyance
5. Hearing 5. The ability to perceive the ethereal vi-
brations termed clairaudience
6. Intuition 6. The capacity to receive true inspiration
7. Thought 7. The power to converse with spiritual in-
transference telligences at will
When the human soul has attained unto these seven states, his
divine right to rule follows as a natural sequence. The powers of the
will increase as the attributes of the soul expand; therefore, it is
perfectly useless to preach so much about cultivating the will, since,
that is accomplished by evolving the soul qualities or senses. The
magical powers of the adept, which enable him to partially control
the elements and to produce various kinds of physical phenomena,
at will, are not the outcome of that terrific will force, so pleasing as
a sentiment to many drawing-room occultists, but, they are the mild
expressions of a fum but gentle soul in the process of evolving forms,
in the spiritual imagery of thought. There is nothing "tremendous,"
nothing of the "fearful intensity," about it, for the slightest tremor
of the purified soul, when consciously placed en rapport with the
astral light, will produce surprising results. And the higher the plane
from which the embodied adept projects his thought desire, the
more extensive and potential the phenomena in the sublunary world
of effects.
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP 167
Such, then, is adeptship; such are the glorious possibilities at-
tainable by the human race, when the spiritual attributes of their
being are allowed to grow and expand in the sunny atmosphere of
a pure and unselfish life. It is a state that may well be regarded as
the climax of our Earth's possibilities upon her outward plane. A
victory of which the human race may justly feel proud, is the grand
triumph of the Soul over the forces of matter.
III HOW ADEPTSHIP IS ATTAINABLE
We will now proceed to explain, as far as permissible, "the modus
operandi" by which adeptship is actually attained. But, first, it will
be necessary to consider who may and who may not possess the
necessary qualifications; since the adept is, of a truth, like the poet,
"born and not made." The adept is a born king of his kind. He is a
spiritual and mental giant of his race, and cannot be made without
possessing these royal qualities, in a very highly developed state
from his birth. External life is too short, and the antagonistic forces
to be overcome too great, during the present cycle, for the adept to
be manufactured out of the rudimentary forces and embryonic soul
qualities of the average mortal. It has been asserted by one who
claims the honor of adeptship, that "the adept is the rare efflorescence
of an age." This is, however, only figuratively correct, as in real
truth, there are several such flowers in each race during the course
of a single generation. Each family plant or race of mankind ultimately
produces the rare flower of its line, and then becomes exhausted for
that cycle. "It has run to seed."
Not all of these rare flowers of the royal line may attain adept-
ship; since they often exhaust their forces in other directions for
the good of humanity; but such souls alone possess the possibilities;
or, in other words, they have the necessary primary inborn qualifi-
cations.
Therefore, when these primary qualifications exist in a person,
the first course to be pursued is to devote as much time as possible
to the study of spiritual subjects obtainable in the outside world,
and to master each and every branch of Occultism. Simultaneously
with this study, the body must be trained in regard to matters of
diet and the sexual relations. In other words; the human soul must
be evolved entirely above the animal soul; i.e., the sphere of un-
168 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
developed good in man's constitution must be developed. The animal
forces, passions and appetites, must be gradually developed, and
transformed or evolved, into human qualities, instead of being con-
quered and chained, like wild beasts, as taught by oriental mystics.
The problem of good and evil must be solved by the student, in
each individual case. And right here consists the vital point of failure
or success, defeat or triumph. Can the student train his physical desires
to work in harmony with his spiritual desires?
We have labored, over and over again, to impress upon the
student, that man is a composite being, and that perfection consists
in harmonious evolution. It ought by this time to be self-evident to
any candid mind, that those fearful practices in the East, of asceticism,
celibacy, self-multilations, etc., are criminally wrong. They simply
starve and chain the animal into subjection, ·instead of developing
it into a useful, obedient and most highly important factor of the
perfect man's seven-fold nature.
In regard to the question of diet, the first aim should be to
remove gradually and yet as rapidly as possible the desire for animal
food. In the flesh of animals, the particles of vegetable matter have
been completely polarized toward the animal soul, hence, when taken
into the human system, they tend at once to build up and fortify that
very portion which we wish to transform and eliminate. Fish, however,
are sufficiently removed from the human to be allowed to the beginner,
yet, as he progresses1
vegetables, grains, and lastly, fruits, will furnish
the requisite amount of physical nourishment.
The question of the sex relation and its various mysteries are
covered in Chapter IV of section I, so we will only add a few words
which seem demanded by the fearful danger arising from the illusive
doctrines now freely circulated by the "inversive magi." Love, pure
and divine, is the grand keynote according to which all the harmonies
of the Infinite Universe are tuned. Love is life and immortality; while
lust and the vicious teachings and practices which insidiously, or open-
ly, produce a contempt for sex and love, all tend toward the dark
satellite and death, in its awful and occult sense. Just in proportion
as love is displaced, self rushes in to fill the vacuum with ruin.
Therefore, to ignorantly follow any occult training which unbalances
or crushes, ends as disastrously in self, as selfishness does to start
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP 169
with. The training must be harmonious to properly develop the
sevenfold nature.
The ascetic, whether ignorant or selfish, who starts out to attain
magical powers for himself, and who enters upon a cold, rigid use of
the will to crush and annihilate his animal passions, may succeed in
these regards; but, he will find out too late, that his powers over the
elements and forces of Nature have been purchased at the awful
expense of the destruction of the feminine portion of his own soul,
by gradual absorption into himself of the being upon whose devel-
opment, in harmony with his own, depends his immortality. He,
therefore, can never realize that union with his twin soul which con-
stitutes the divine Ego. He can only know self. Thenceforward, he
denies there is aught in the universe beyond his state, except Nirvana
to which he is drifting, which is practically a condition of annihi-
lation, but which he fondly pictures, in as vague and pleasing terms
as possible, as "absorption into the Infinite." He denies point blank
(since they no longer exist for him) the angelic and celestial states,
and devotes himself to a systematic dissemination of the dogmas of
karma and re-incarnation. Karma and re-incarnation are the most
subtle and enervating forms of fatality conceivable by the human
mind, since they sap the soul of all true inspiration toward the higher
self and perfect life. These subtle doctrines not only continually
prompt man to leave undone many things until his next incarnation,
but, generally, they leave mankind in that helpless, apathetic condi-
tion, exactly suited to render them an easy prey for the inversive
magi, who exist upon their vitality.
We will now give a few directions for the evolution of the soul
senses or qualities. In the first place, some special time in the morn-
ing and evening should be set apart for the evolution of the spiritual
sight. This may be done by gazing into a crystal magic mirror, or
magnetic disc, which is used, matters not, since spiritual lucidity (if
the quality exists) will be developed. The spiritual sense of touch, or
the powers of psychometry, should be evolved (as often as possible)
by placing any object that comes handy, such as rocks, shells, letters,
etc., to the forehead. If no particular perception transpires, try the
sensorium or that part of the brain situated between the crown and
the forehead. If this effort should fail, try the solar plexus, and note
the impressions received, then test these as to their correctness or
170 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
otherwise, by examination of the article. Remember, that, many ef-
forts may be required to arouse the dormant sense into action; there-
fore, do not be discouraged at repeated failures. The sense of spir-
itual hearing or clairaudience will follow the senses of sight and
touch as a natural sequence. When these senses are evolved the
primary difficulties are over and that one who will thenceforward act
as master and teacher will make himself known. How, when or where
we cannot say, but, there will be no mistake; no fear of deception by
the Black magi; the truth will be realized within; it will not require
one single shadow of external phenomena to convince that soul
which is fully prepared for the master's reception; neither will the
student have long to wait in expectation. "At the very hour when the
soul is ready, behold its guide will appear."
The student should fully realize by this time, that, the soul
powers mentioned above, possess nothing in common with the so-
called spiritual gifts, evolved during the development of spirit me-
diumship. The medium is under the partial or absolute control of
some foreign mind, but the neophyte, in the course of his develop-
ment, evolves powers which are the free, clear, conscious outcome of
his own divine nature. Consequently, in self protection, when training
our spiritual· nature, we should isolate ourselves from contact with
the discordant world as much as possible. A life among the wild
mountain solitudes is especially potent in this respect, as it brings us
at once in direct contact with Nature as she really is. In these sur-
roundings, the senses of the soul become stimulated and quickened,
the physical organism is removed from the contaminating pollution
of city life, and is thus protected from the unseen snares and tempta-
tions of the world. And as the external mind, when alone, soon begins
to explore the craggy mountain sides and examine their fauna and
flora; so the soul, when removed from the chaiil.ing magnetism of
large masses of men, soon begins to soar upwards towards its source
on high, returning from each spiritual Hight with some occult treas-
ure for its owner, though he at first may not fully realize the precious
jewels which he is accumulating.
As there may be many roads which will ultimately lead us to the
same mountain top, so there are many systems of occult training.
But the one best suited for the Western Races has been presented.
The end in view of every system is the same, viz.; first to evolve con-
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOUL-ADEPTSHIP 171
scious lucidity, then the rest will follow. When once the aspirant
becomes the accepted neophyte, whether he personally sees the master
or internally realizes him, makes no difference, his future progress
depends upon his strict obedience to the commands received, unselfish
motives, and a pure life.
To persons of negative temperaments, Yoga training will pro-
duce the desired results. But this system is more suitable for eastern
organisms than Western. There is, however, a mine of Occult lore
in "Yoga Philosophy."
With these remarks we bring the present course of occult study
to a close. The studies presented here are probably as much as
the ordinary human mind will be able to realize, during this age
of the world. At every step we made in writing this book, we had
to fight against the fierce, cruel legionaries of the Black Magi,
whose terrible secrets we have been the means of revealing to the
world. These inversive brethren pose before the world to-day as
the harbingers of light and oriental wisdom, but, beneath this
external delusive glamor, we can see the bloodthirsty forms of the
shadow. Our task has been accomplished rather with the point
of the sword than through the instrumentality of the pen. The
mediumistic upholders and supporters of oriental magic, dogma
and delusion, have also done their best to destroy our work; but
it lives; and will survive long enough to crush them with its glittering
force; for omnia vincit veritas, constitutes the motive force behind
it. Charges of fraud, and accusations of Black magic, have been
systematically tried without avail; and nothing now remains for
them but calumny and slander; but, whatever these inversive oppo-
nents of truth may see fit to bring forth in the future in order to stem
the swelling tide of Occult knowledge and spiritual progress, rest
assured, they will ultimately fail; and the terrible agonies of their
conscious defeat will discount a thousand times the benefits of an
apparently temporary gain. Here we close this part of our work,
casting our labors as bread upon the mental currents of life, and
wait with patience, for it will be after many days ere the results
will be known. In the meantime, we shall rest with the certain
knowledge that whatever is, is good, undeveloped though it be.
Throughout the preceding chapters the author has repeatedly
directed his criticism against Buddhistical Theosophy. In so doing
172 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
he desires his readers to always bear in mind that, he does not include
any true Theosophist, nor any really earnest seeker after the hidden
light of Occult lore, be they theosophists, Jews of the orthodox faith,
or Christians. In using the terms of Buddhistical Theosophy, Modern
Theosophy, etc., he means only the hidden disseminators and public
worshippers, of that peculiar phase of Buddhism wrongly called eso-
teric, which make re-incarnation and Karma an absolute dogma of
faith; and the corner stone of Occult philosophy; as intimated by the
real external founder ofT. S. in the columns of ''The Path," in an article
professing to "explain" certain very inconvenient passages in "Isis
Unveiled."

QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS ANSWERING
QUESTIONS OF PRIVATE STUDENTS
The following quotations are from letters of Thomas H. Burgoyne (Zanoni)
addressed to one of his pupils. They are from letters that were lessons. Others may
question and find these replies an answer. Only students of The Hermetic Brother-
hood of Luxor will recognize Zanoni as the Messenger and so receive these
elucidations of the Path as authentic. Belle M. Wagner.
Where is the Divine Ego? Ordinary language cannot convey
anything but a most crude conception of spiritual things, and even
at best the realities of the higher life can only be explained in
parables by utilizing earthly things by way of illustration, so I will
offer an illustration used some time ago.
Suppose we have a globe of glass or other material capable
of absolutely confining everything within its own circumference, and
further let us suppose that it is a vacuum inside. Now, let us fill this
globe with steam (not air) which is, as we know, an ethereal form of
water. Mter the globe is filled with this vapor, it is, of course, full and
no more can be forced into it. Let us further suppose that the globe has
a sufficient temperature to maintain the steam therein at its invisible
thermal condition. The capacity of our globe is thus exhausted with
the watery element, which we will say is one gallon. We can now
put one gallon of volatile alcohol into the globe and the atoms of
alcohol will find room amid the atoms of steam. We can also further
take a still higher form of matter and insert one gallon of ether
(not the ether we breathe but the kind distilled from alcohol) into
our globe. We now have three elements filling a globe of which
not an atom more of either could be inserted if it was a perfect vacuum.
It is a case of one within the other yet being the same size of each
other. Of course, we might go on almost indefinitely, so that it amounts
to this; there are seven- dimensions of matter, and we will suppose
them to be cubes one foot square, thus-
~i~rai~~~~90!mk~~~~~:dtsiOI:
Now, within ow· cube of pure mineral all the other six can be
absorbed, although all are exactly the same size, and there will re-
174 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
main visible the one cube of matter, and, to the physical senses, it
will be just the same after as before this absorption, except that it
will weigh a little more after the other six are a part of it. It is a
STATE WITHIN A STATE, as the soul within the body, the Astral
body, the Spiritual body, etc., and the Divine Ego is in the SEVENTH
STATE, viz. the Celestial Heavens of our solar system; but we can no
more precisely point where, as to a certain point in space, than you
can locate the ether and the atmosphere; it is above and around us
as well as within. Until the human mind is capable of understanding
the terms WITHOUT and WITHIN apart from supposing that, a
thing within must be smaller than the object enclosing it, and that
the atoms of the one constitute a world totally free and apart from
the atoms of the other, no real conception of a true spiritual reality
can be formed. The very world in which we live, the houses we
occupy, and the streets we frequent, are equally as crowded spirit-
ually as materially. There are Astral Cities within Material Cities, and
the inhabitants of the interior are as unconscious (generally) of the
physical inhabitants of the exterior as the exterior masses are of the
internal occupants. These lower cities and states are upon the first
or earth sphere, and constitute the Hells of the soul world, and stimu-
late all the real Hells we see in every crowded city. You must not
look upon the Divine Ego as some great angelic power. It is a simple
Cherub of Innocence, lacking ·wisdom and real intelligence, even as
a babe. The two parts of itself are the soul monads projected from
the little, pure Cherub Sun, like reflected rays; and its powers become
crystallized in matter; the Man, the Wisdom or Intelligent and Posi-
tive force; and the Woman, the Love and Formative or Plastic power;
finally the cycle is complete; the Man in his acquired Wisdom and
conscious knowledge of Creation; and Woman, in all her matured
Beauty and realized Love; then the Soul Ego becomes absorbed with-
in their own Divine Form, and they become like two suns, which
eternally revolve around each other, the CENTRAL INVISIBLE
FOCUS of which is the atomic point of contact; and you can no more
locate this invisible Deity than you can tell where the Red rays of the
spectrum terminate, or where the Orange rays begin. It is a part of
each. It is no more a part of one than of the other, and the two form
one complete whole. This is as far as language can explain.
You ask whether it is right to appeal to the Divine Soul as within.
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 175
Yes it is. Woman should always locate her aspirations in the breast.
Her bosom is the seat of her highest spiritual vibrations. The brain
is the location in man.
Each planet prepares the zone for her own disembodied offspring.
The souls of these zones have formed a grand inter-planetary zone.
This is a fact which I have verified; but this zone is not in direct
contact with our earth.
All of the visible stars; telescopic or otherwise, belong to our
Universe and this universe has one mighty, inconceivable center; a
glorious spiritual sun. Each one of the myriad suns of the first order
are parents of countless secondary suns, and our own sun is one of
these secondary suns. We cannot see any other Universe than our own,
until we reach the solar sphere and become the angel; and then, not
until we are prepared to ascend into other and brighter realms of
being.
Mankind face a glorious destiny and the small sufferings of ex-
ternal life, fearful though they may seem to those still in the flesh, are
as nothing compared with the endless possibilities of the human soul.
And Oh, how my heart longs, at times, for the bright realms that I
have so often trod; for the glorious vistas of the Infinite's bright crea-
tion; for that plane of life wherein the soul perceives the might and
majesty of GOD in all the scintillating gems of His flashing, fiery
crown. Each jewel is a glorious sun pulsating with creative life and
carrying onward in the wild, whirling journey of evolution, its brood
of planets with their countless races of intellectual beings, souls and
Deific entities, brought forth as the manifestation of the Infinite Good
(GOD).
The symbol upo:Q. the cover of this book The Light of Egypt is
complex. It is the symbol of Spiritual Initiation, and means, literally,
"I have pierced the illusions of matter. I am conscious that I am
Divine." The seven stars represent the seven Principles of Nature.
The serpent represents the objective phenomena, and the arrow pierc-
ing the serpent represents the human soul which is conscious of its
origin, power and destiny.
It is when I read such articles as the one put forth by Huxley
that my own eternal spirit rises in just indignation. Oh, that I could
spread before the suffering world but one tithe even of the grand,
glorious, eternal spheres of supernal existence that await the human
176 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
souls after the change called death. Oh, that I were only able to reach
each human heart, that must sink in despair when they read such
soul-killing words of Atheism, and breath~ into them the 1oys of the
land that is beyond the sunset of this earthly life; of the land that is
indeed fairer than day, where the spirits and angels dwell. Would that
I could only reveal to them the marvelous beauties of super-mundane
life that I and others have seen with our very eyes and recite the
wonderous harmonies we have heard with our ears; speak to them
of the unutterable beauties of celestial landscapes that our feet have
trod, and tell them that life is ETERNAL and PROGRESSIVE; and
that the soul's own bright individuality increases forever in Wisdom
and Immortality. But, alas, it can not be. Men and woman must work
out their own salvation and render unto themselves a just account
of the deeds done while in the body. They would not accept the
eternal food I spread before them, they would not understand. I am
like a rich man, possessing in over-flowing abundance the fruits that
are eternal, while thousands pass my door, starving; and yet they will
not come in and be filled. But they continue on their way, seeking
after dreary forms of belief that crucify them in Faith, Hope and
Charity; they persist in flying from the light to become blind followers
of blinded professors.
The soul at death enters the astral soul world immediately sur-
rounding the planet. After purification, it passes on to the mighty
zones in the orbital path of the earth. It is in these beautiful zones
that the spirit homes, in the true sense, exist. Your higher aspirations,
your sublimest ideals are there, beautiful, living realities entwined with
the struggles, hopes, thoughts and victories of the Twin Souls.
My science and the religion I teach and wqrship is Nature's laws;
my aim is the royal grandeur that surrounds the true perfected man.
Thank God, I know, my teachings are not speculations. They are the
living outcome of what I have seen with my eyes, found with my mind
and heard with my ears.
If the emotion responds to the expression, it does serious harm;
for the emotions are the reactions of the magnetic vibrations produced
upon the Odylic Sphere; and, like a storm (it is really a storm) at sea,
even after it is over and the sun shining again, etc., there is still an
angry swell of the waves for some time; and the more frequent such
emotions are brought into play, the more susceptible the actor be-
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 177
comes and the more readily they will respond in stern reality to the
parts they have played. If we want harmony, love, truth and true
brotherhood, we want as little of the contrary conditions as possible.
The true growth is to imitate love when hatred springs up; child-
like innocence when jealousy would take full possession. There can-
not be too much of this, if the motive be pure; if impure, then hypoc-
risy is the outcome, and this is wrong.
Never pantomime anyone except for some very important reason,
because when so doing you penetrate the astral life forces of the per-
son, and so very few are pure that you cannot help suffering to some
extent from the contact. An angel is not pure enough to enter Hell
and return without taint, except after a special preparation for the
purpose, and besides this you contact magnetic currents that may
react upon you for many years to come.
One word about facial expression; when a person has such com-
plete control as to personate Hate, and, at the same time feel Love,
they may carry such facial expression to any extent without danger.
This is true art. It is, however, imitating Nature under false pretenses,
so to say.
Twins in spirit are naturally a part of each other, and when the
state of Angelhood is reached, there is but one Odylic sphere between
the two. It is the Mystery of the Trinity; God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghost; yet there are not three Gods, but only
One God.
It is the Male, the Female and the Divine Ego, or Crown, united
in the grand triad of Angel that completes the Trinity. The Divine
male, or Wisdom, which gives forth the idea of all action; the Divine
female, which clothes the idea of her Lord with form from her crea-
tive nature, and the sexual vibrations of both which endow the idea
with evolutionary life and motion; these constitute one of the arcane
mysteries of life.
On such subjects as these I could write volume after volume and
neither tire nor reach the end of experience and the things I have
seen and heard in realms of brighter beings than on earth. Many
marvels have been disclosed to me in my wanderings in the Occult
world. I could tell you of the homes of the dead, of the damned, of
the lost; of the homes of the blest, of the pure and virtuous in life;
and of infinitely higher realms than these, where no mortal of earth
178 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
hath trod, or even dreamed of; except he has passed through the fire
of soul purification, a fire seven times hotter than the fiery furnace
that purified Shadrach and his companions.
I put my body into the deep magnetic sleep and instantly leaped
forth into the boundless ether. Oh, how gloriously Orion and the
Pleiades were shining in the starry vault of night. The Moon lent her
glory to the scene while all the living, pulsating, life of the astral spaces
was joyous with the full vigor of creative life. I merely noticed these
things as I sped with the swiftness of light itseH, once more, to visit my
far-off spirit home; once more, to see the treasures I had collected in
the past; treasures I had fought for, suffered for; treasures that I had
won for myseH alone. Oh, how I drank in the melodies of the circu-
lating stars and from the bottom of my soul sang forth, 'We praise
thee, 0 God."
This world is a preparatory place of probation, passion and pain,
to expand the inner spiritual seH and enable it to reach outward and
upward toward that grander life that constitutes the goal of every
purified soul after its final Initiation.
Our organisms are nothing more than the plastic molds of medi-
umistic matter; external vehicles of the soul; through which it may
attract to and gather up the varied experiences of mundane life. They
are forms, as transitory as the fleeting clouds above us, which become
the sensitive plates, whereby the marvelous vibrations of creative and
Deific life may express their wonderful transformations of sensations;
and which, in turn, produce all the multitudinous delights of the phys-
ical senses; while the only living reality amid the Universe of moving,
transitory and apparent realities, is the Divine Ego; God of each
biune -soul. Each one of us is but one of the reacting forces of a biune
soul, and the immortal Ego; which binds together and forever the
separated yet united identity of each. Each one's Ego is their own
God; the only God; for Allah in His own image created He himi male
and female created He them.
Woman was not the cause of the "fall". The real cause, per se,
of descent into external conditions, was the necessity for conflict with
the grosser forms of life and matter, whereby the soul could awaken
the dormant atomic entities of its own being. The fall was a neces-
sity of further progress, and the separation of the biune soul, the
spiritual divorce, so to say, between Osiris and Isis; was because of
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 179
the impossibility of the soul sinking beneath the forces of matter when
united. It was only by separation and weakening their power that
elemental conditions could subjugate them for a time. There is noth-
ing impossible to the reunited souls. They become, by Divine Right,
the King and Queen, co-equal and co-eternal rulers over all the ele-
ments in Nature. Their will, in the Astral world, is law; and the reason
why the few souls who do become united, by the accident of marriage
on Earth, are not more powerful, is because they are ignorant of their
Divine relationship. They have the power but they do not know it.
They are like a poor man dying of poverty with millions of dollars
hidden under his hearthstone.
Each planet, moon or sun, evolves Karmic zones from the life
principles of its own nature. They are the realms of astral life; and
by reaction become the spaces of causation for every form and every
manifestation of objective phenomena. When man appears upon the
scene of action, the laws of his being form around the orb which
evolved his race, a heavenly zone; a realm suitable to his condition
and the mental evolution to which he corresponds. To say that the
Earth, for instance throws off the substances generated from its own
independent action is wrong; for, in a larger sense than we apprehend,
worlds are cosmic individuals, of which, like human beings, no two are
alike. They are bi-sexual organisms, however; and therefore, the ethe-
real zones or spirit worlds, they form in space for their offspring, con-
stitute the Karma of their lives; just as the actions and motives of
individuals form their Karma in the world to come.
The worlds of space breathe even as man breathes. "The breath
of God" in man is only a miniature of "the breath of God" in worlds.
The planet inbreathes to give its offspring life, and the planet's respir-
ations constitute the material, so to say, from which the ethereal
heavens are formed. These zones move with the Earth and the sys-
tem of which she forms a part. Each orbit is fixed within certain
limits, as is man's freedom of action, and these orbital paths, which
constitute the center around which the zones of life are formed, move
with the solar system; each system being, in one sense, an universe of
its own, carrying with it both objective and subjective materials.
The sun of our system is surrounded by mighty sun spheres which
extend all the inconceivable stretch of space represented by the vast
180 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
orbit of our sun. Vast beyond belief as it takes 25,920 years of earth
time for our sun to complete one round of its vast orbit.
The correspondence between the human form and the astral body
is very close, so close, in fact, that no one could mistake the likeness;
but it is, of course, more ethereal in its features. If the individual be
one of active mind, noble qualities and high aspirations, the astral
counterpart, while being a true likeness in many respects, gives a higher
expression to each line in the countenance and features, which cor-
respond to the qualities manifested. It is more Divine in its looks and
lineaments; looks like an angelic brother or sister of the physical body.
But, on the contrary, if the individual be gross, selfish, brutal and a
slave to his lusts and passions, then the astral takes on a hideous
countenance; is demoniac in its lines and features.
When the higher realms of the spirit spheres are reached and the
true spiritual body manifests, there are the same differences, the form
becoming more and more Divine and beautiful.
In all states the human form is maintained. It becomes, more and
more, inconceivably beautiful as it progresses higher and higher. The
internal organs of the body are simply the means by which certain
functions are manifested and performed. Each organ, group of organs,
function and set of functions, have an astral and spiritual correspond-
ence; but, rid the mind. of the gross, material part. The heart, lungs
and liver are all there (not in the same form, however,) in the astral
organism, and in the astral world disembodied souls eat and drink
as we do, but their food is strictly subjective; it corresponds to their
state.
In the spirit realm proper, life is continued by breathing and
absorption. There is pregnancy and birth in the angelic world even
as there is in this, but under very different conditions. The sexual
organs on earth represent sacred functions in Heaven.
In the spiritual world, vivid formulation is an absolute necessity
of possession. If you can vividly formulate the image of what you
desire and bring it to you, it becomes as real, hard and firm as a table
in the material world; that is, if the object possess such properties; but
if you grasp after it, it will vanish from your sight. Most people who
die live in a strange, dreamy, vanishing world.
If a spirit is not of my vibration, he cannot see me nor· my
surroundings.
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 181
You cannot understand now, but you will, the wondedul state
of being where all are one and yet are individual. To become one
with these legions of the blest is to give the soul to Ra.
In the spiritual world you will find great brotherhoods of music,
medicine, astrology, etc., Each has a head supreme in the particular
vocation represented by the brotherhood. Over all is a supreme,
priestly power who does not dictate but counsels.
A tone arouses vast legions of life, when the particular vibration
of their life is. sounded. They take form and act as servants of the
potency that can arouse them.
For a soul to be immortal, there must be something immortal and
vital in his internal mind, for his atoms to revolve about; a principle
of justice, and love. This is the axiom of immortality.
Only the angels of the sun return to the sun.
What you truly expect will be your destiny.
Curses are elliptical in their orbit, when the curse is heavier than

Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that
which is God's. Only as you learn to do that, can you be just, and only
when just, can curses or blessings be rightfully administered.
A soul is true when performing its functions.
All of the races that have thought of beauty have left the potency
of their ideas in the astral light and become a fecund cause of its
externalization.
Human beings on the earth plane can concentrate their minds on
some definite thing and the results are sometimes astounding. Most
people think idly, vaguely; then someone's strong mind can attract
these wandering thought vibrations and, making his own brain the
instrument for the display of the collected energy, launch his own idea
on the sensitive camera of the astral light and produce a thought form
that he can send with fearful potency to pedorm his will. This is to
be a Black Magician; for the only form of power that the Adept should
launch is his owN IDEAL OF HIMSELF, in higher and better states
than he has attained to. He receives that ideal by reflection from his
Soul Mate.
At death, the soul enters its own soul images, and with relentless
monotony, the panorama of all he has vitalized swings around him.
He rests no more than a sleeping body in awful dreams; and these
182 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
images continue for ages, aye, for thousands of years; until the soul
can endure no more and falls asleep, to awaken; if it does awaken;
only as a little child. It is to escape this that the Occultist toils and
labors.
Relax and concentrate your soul on your solar plexus, saying the
Mantram, "My soul is one with the Universe and my spirit an emana-
tion from God," then ask yourself, who am I? what have I been? and
what must I become?
The monad is incarnated in the brain. It may be asleep while tl1e
over-soul of the brain (animal soul) is awake; or the monad (human
soul) may be awake and the animal soul asleep; or both may be
awake; then the King rides in his chariot.
Truer than all, is the saying of Christ, "My Father and I are one."
Nowhere can a creator be found. We ourselves are the outcome of
life and effort. Effort is our immortality; always striving for that which
we are not. The next existence is like this in essence, but more vivid.
The human heart is the only moral life there is. Life is neither moral
nor immoral; neither God nor Devil; and when the soul can penetrate
and see and KNOW the Truth, the NAKED TRUTH, it says, "My
Father and I are one."
The women are losing their feminity and thus are losing their
conscious immortality.
Effort is immortality. When the soul sees an ideal beyond his
own performance, then, at that very moment, he ceases to be immortal.
Again I would say, that, on man depends a woman's immortality,
and on woman the man's, for no one can make an ideal of himself. He
receives the image by reflection and then grows the power to become it
through love; thus man, by his ideal, raises the WQman of whom he is
the expression, and woman, by her ideal, raises the man of whom she
is the expression; thus they are the creators of each other. In soul
matehood neither one nor the other can be greater than each one's
inherent ideal of the other, and, unless that ideal is rounded out, they
fail of their united immortality. This is a great and awful truth.
Ra is, and you reach him only by the deep conviction of his ex-
istence and the profound pleadings of the heart. He is the creator
of this Earth and therefore never lived on it. He belongs to a previous
evolution; is, as it were, the incarnation of the oversoul of the great
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 183
sun-sphere. To give the soul to Ra is to become one with those legions
of the blest.
The soul must never sleep or die without affirming its immortality.
Every immortal soul is the seed of a Universe; but millions have
no immortality.
In life MEAN your sympathy with others; do not SUFFER it.
Nothing in life is worth while but moral effort. There you have the
key, if you know how to use it.
Stand apart from life and look upon the acts of your own and
other lives as a drama played by indifferent actors. I speak of the
objective life. Only principle is vital.
Ue down, and, commencing with your feet, say, mentally, "my
consciousness is not in my feet" and feel an indrawing therefrom. Then
the hands, legs, arms, abdomen, solar plexus and brain, and finally
rest in the monad alone. Then indraw the thought of your soul ideal
to that center, the Divine haH, your Soul Mate, and the blend will
take place. Then redraw the love thought to the region of the heart
and breasts and breathe your love in dynamic respirations.
For vital strength, be conscious of your vitality, and hold it in
the solar plexus, never in the brain.
When women have their monthly periods, they lose a great deal

There are those in your life who must pass out of all life; for, know
that, all are not immortal.
It is a great thing to be IMMORTAL.
When one has sinned against their own sdul, that one loses his
immortality. The Ego buds in the surviving half, in the monad of the
Soul Mate, that has not so sinned; a new half, when the first has failed;
and the journey is again to be made of Involution and Evolution, while
the surviving half waits for the prodigal.
One must have keen repentance for past sins. Not to have it, is
to be the Devil. Every atom of sin must be atoned for; every debt
to Nature paid in full.
Give to your Divine Love the soul of your heart. Do you under-
. stand, "the soul of your heart," the ubiquitous sense of, I in You, and
You in Me; as you read in the Gospel of the 1st. John?
I give you the key; Hold your love ideal in the morning; it gives
the vibrations of the day.

You can live in Paradise now just as well as in five, ten or seventy

All the lower self must be raised into that higher consciousness, if we

This is the Occult Catechism; Q. Who and what is Man? A. The

makes Man.
There comes a time when the seeker becomes a fakir or a saint.
A few, born to it, attain practical Occultism, but generally elsewhere

Grace before Eating; only in the flesh can one enter into true
relations of the spirits of the flesh. They become yc;>ur servants or your
masters, just as you treat them. Your body is related to all the king-
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 185
doms of matter and consequently to all ascending life spirits. So re-
peat this from your soul before each meal; "Eternal spirit in whom
we live, breathe, move and have our being, consecrate this food we are·
about to partake of, to our bodies as well as our souls, and also to
those ministers of thine who may be present. Peace be between us."
Then throw some salt down to the spirit of earth.
When the soul calmly looks upon virtue and vice, as power and
sin, and suffering as experience; then is the angei evolving; but make
no mistake, vice must be conquered.
The Avatar, the Messenger, must be the harp whose notes vibrate
in all the spheres. To be that harp, the physical body must be medi-
umistically sensitive, with a strong, dominant soul in control, allowing,
however, the body to vibrate sympathetically to all forms of suffering.
The Messenger must feel. It is feeling that creates. Figure the creation
of a world first as vapor, which only FEELINGS and THOUGHTS
can impregnate. The harp, the chord, the word, having felt with all;
is the seed and Ra of a Universe.
Cosmic consciousness, like any other flash-light of spiritual in-
spiration and truth, is, on this plane, of very secondary importance so
far as actual value is concerned. It is wholly worthless as a realization
of any truth and at best, even in its highest manifestation it is purely
personal, and means nothing to any one, outside of this one's person-
ality. Whatever idea or set of ideas happens to possess the soul of the
person, their cosmic consciousness will be colored by it. We have
three notable instances, viz., Andrew Jackson Davis, Jakob Boehme and
Emanuel Swedenborg; each of whose cosmic at-one-ments were tiue;
but whose sub-consciousness's were possessed of different root ideas;
hence they differed materially from each o~her, and all were wrong
as to the real truth, per se. I, myself, have had this cosmic atonement
at least a thousand times, in fact, it was a part of my daily life at one
period; but unless you, yourself, be grounded in the very truth of
things, these ecstatic trance-like experiences are about as valuable
as those of St. Francis of Assisi; in other words, of no value whatever
to any one but the personal experience of the person. One living, vital,
clearly expressed thought is worth a thousand hazy spiritual dreams.
The Immortality of the human soul depends upon action. The
man or woman who lives a purely ignorant, worldly life, who does not
in any sense feed the interior spiritual nature, drifts into a sort of
186 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
mental decay and spiritual rot; and at death, like the old tree, as it
falls so it lies; but if the tree is cut during its vital life, when it is full
of vigor, it instantly sends up a second growth far more powerful and
vital than the first. It is the same with man; if he dies with spiritual
vitality quickening his being, then he lives on after death, bridges the
abyss of the two worlds, and has all the potentialities of a God within
him.
Immortality depends upon mental and spiritual vitality, not
physical energy. The physical body is merely the earth, so to say,
whose main office is the evolution of spiritual life; but man mostly
makes it nothing but the basis and center of purely material ends.
Jesus of Nazereth was right, "Lay up treasures where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break in and steal."
Thoughts, ideas and aspirations, become powers, To Be. These
are re-incarnated into other lives after some human soul has given
them material birth; but the monad, the Spiritual Soul, the thing that
thinks, NEVER. Its only chance for immortal life is Here and Now,
when incarnated as man on earth.
Man does Not return to earth a second or third time, to correct
former errors and try anew. An acorn may become an oak tree_ but
the tree never returns to an acorn.
Each spirit Ego sends forth its soul monad with its just share of
its Divine patrimony, when it obeys the universal law of attraction to
matter. With this fair equipment it begins its eternal round of being
from a limitless state within the universe of external manifestation;
and like everything else endowed with life, it attracts and repels, and
in any state, it can only do the best it can. Its best is, when its own
inherent force is dominant; its worst is, when it is weak by reaction.
Its life at any point is only a mere transitory condition, a mere moment
in the web of its eternal existence. At every stage it loses or. gains
something, and the sum total of such gain and loss comprises its Human
possibilities, when it becomes incarnated as man, and constitutes his
need for expression; be that expression what it may. But in assuming
the responsibility of a Human soul, the monad must take its chances;
so to say, regarding its environment before and after birth. It will be
brought into the light of the intellectual day by powers over which
it has no control; viz., Polarity; natural attraction and replusion of its
Spiritual State of development. Money, rank and family, have no value
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 187
in the spiritual world; because they are unreal, temporary, man made.
The eternal verities only have power. The polarity is that which
attracts it to the mother's womb; its Spiritual state determines its
mental capacity; and these two, Polarity and Spiritual Degree of life;
acting in harmony or conflict with its material environment, produce
everything we know of life; and to these must be added another factor,
an unknown quantity, the inherited tendencies or real qualities of the
parents, to warp or expand the young soul. Some people are more
animal than human and should not be parents. Some are dwarfed
below their normal state, some are expanded beyond their real merits.
Human destiny begins its harvest, only in this life; and as life becomes
more advanced, so will destiny.
Today, we are forging the environment and fate of the millions
of souls of the unborn generations to come. Fate can only act when
conditions are ripe, remove vice and crime from the earth, and
human destiny is powerless to reproduce them. - Remove riches,
poverty, drink, social rank, and disease, by just laws, moral education
and pure living; and fate can not reproduce them. In this higher
condition of man, destiny will act upon some thing higher than
disease, poverty and crime. There are other things in the gamut
of life, for there will be discord of some nature, and hereby destiny
will become manifest. Where man WILLS, the fates themselves are
powerless; but it must be the Will of Universal not Individual man.
Each soul is and ever must be the arbiter of its own destiny,
and whatever our fate here, in this our earthly environment, WE
have WILLED it so. We, without knowing it, have given the Nod
of Jove to every great crisis in our lives; for every crime; for every
grace; and we alone, must be the judge, and bear the judgment
too. Only be sure that you attain the one vital reason for you being
here upon earth; be sure that you gain the crown of Conscious life;
for this also rests upon the same laws as destiny; it is NOT certain,
unless WE MAKE IT SO; for "many come but few are chosen",
and those, whose names are written in the Book of Life, can in no
wise remove the self inflicted curse from those whose names are
not, therein.
Who then, can for a moment question Fate, or asking fate, who
can say why this evil, why this good, seeing, that in either case,
the moment of its existence is past and gone, before an answer could
188 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
be given; and new actions have taken their place. So it is with
earthly life, it is one moment only, a single breath in the scale of
being, a half conscious dream of the senses from which we shall
awake, thankful in any case to find that after all; it was but a dream,
and that the crown of life, the Sacred Jewel of the Lotus, lies beyond-
Beyond the distant blue,
Beyond the vaults of heaven, where the
starland shimmers bright,
Beyond the blazing morning suns.
Beyond the orbs of night.
Beyond all things that man has thought,
Beyond what Saint has seen,
There lies the Crown, ETERNAL LIFE,
SELF WROUGHT BY SELF MADE BEING.
These things I KNOW, and in view thereof, can I not ask like the in-
spired apostle, "0 death where is thy sting, 0 Grave where is thy
victory?"
The physical body cannot always be controlled or made to ex-
press the real state of the spiritual ideal. In fact, very rarely can this
be done; because it is not possible under present earthly conditions,
race conditions, for one person to completely subdue his environment.
Rare, very rare organisms are capable of doing this, but then such
rara-avis, are as infrequent as the giants of genius. The ideal life may
be lived, however, by all who can grasp the idea of I AM; as long as
they can hold on to the central know; so to say, hold on to a chain
whose link is the Illuminated I, the EGO.
We all can make the body more expressive of the spirit, than it
is; but most of all depends on prenatal conditions, over which we
have very little control.
It is little better than nonsense to say that selfishness manifests
itself as constipation, and vanity as dispepsia, etc. pure nonsense. That
is going crazy after correspondences and like the blind man of Bun-
yan's jury saying, I see, when he had no sight.
That mental states and characteristics have their reflex action
there can be no doubt, because the one implies the other, but selfish-
ness in one man may cause anything from indigestion to syphilis,
while in another it might only hurt his liver, his lungs or his spleen;
in other words, the same mental trait will affiict differently, different
organisms; all depending on race, heredity, and astral influx, and
this last is the most potent of all others.
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 189
The great altruistic thoughts and ideas people give birth to, will
live; yea, and mature; bringing forth as the scriptures say, "some
forty, some sixty, some an hundred fold." It is right here that re-in-
carnation is a Divine truth; for thoughts and ideas are re-incarnated,
but not man. Also right here, that we explain the paradox of what
Plato said, "Ideas rule the world," and in the next breath, "Spiritual
ideas are impotent against purely material forces." But, let those spir-
itual ideas become incarnated in material forms, then they are po-
tent; they rule the world; then they become the power of mind behind
the human throne.
You and I, and, to a greater or less extent, every embodied soul,
are the centers of ideas incarnated in us, and controlled by the monad;
like the Sun sways his satellites. Certain groups of ideas will external-
ize as things, being in a certain stage of gestation, so to say; and from
the knowledge and power of seeing this clearly, an event can be es-
timated with the same precision as the birth of a child can be fore-
told by a trained physician'; consequently, those who are psychic, may
not know WHEN the birth of an event will occur, but they Feel that
it will, hence prophecy.
The primal foundation of all thought is right here, for instance,
M. Theon may wish a certain result; if I am receptive, the idea may
become incarnated in me, and under an extra spiritual stimulus it
may grow and mature and become a material fact.
Who shall say, with any actual knowledge, what or whence, of
the power behind the Great White Throne of Deity, the Infinite Crea-
tor, or where or in what manner, began the very dawn of primeval
creation. It cannot be. The mind becomes dazed at the thought, and
the soul itself would become insane in any attempt to penetrate within
this infinite force, the impregnable mystery of the Infinite Universe of
Being.
You are quite right in saying that others must have asked the
same question. Yea, truly this is so; for in the fathomless past, mil-
lions of eons before our Sun had an existence, even; this question
arose in the minds of those who, in other worlds, began to feel the
promptings of an immortal soul. But it is, after all, but the query of
a child in spiritual experience; and by correspondence, upon the same
plane as the child of today; who asks about the man in the Moon,
"how did he get up there." Also, as the first scientific mind began to
190 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
speculate of things beyond the limited vision of his fellow beings, in
their dimly lighted cave asked,•"What is Life?,
Today, with all our marvelous advancement in the realm of physics,
chemistry, the revelations of the Spectroscope, we are not one iota
nearer the actual solution of the cause. As Hermes says, "All is living,
Life is one, God is Life,, and therefore, "the origin of life is in God."
Your question, therefore, resolves itself into knowing God. You can,
as you already know, only attain this knowledge yourself; as you
realize, you are a part of God.
There is an old myth, or perhaps it had better be called a symbol
of The Beginning; the Winged Egg of Deity, floating, unconscious,
upon the unmanifested void, an universal ocean of formless Aeth.
After millions of ages had passed, the primordial cell, the origin of all
things, began to move with life, and The Universe began; but, "how
came the egg there?, To answer that is beyond my power.
As to intelligence, yes, emphatically so; listen to me; In the low-
est stratas of unmanifested life, organic ·or inorganic, there exists
mind in some degree. Back of this; back, conscious mind reaches into
the great unknown, infinite void of all manifestation. It lives, unseen;
and to us, unmanifested being. It is there, that life and being first
flow outward; brought out; so far as the organic worlds are concerned;
by the cyclic pulsations, of ail the outward towards the inward being,
of the Universe; the great unknown; the very Arch Deity of All is
there; not as a being with parts, but as an ocean of living mind, of
unmanifested seed; The Great All Father of All Being; the biune
Father-Mother, life of everything that is, was, or, shall be; and from
HIM flow the infinite rivers of living force, to become manifest. This
state is the Isis, of the Soul of the Universe. Biogenesis is the Divine
Law; life from life, God is life, and life is thought.
There are only certain fundamental truths that are true, per se,
which possess definite reality. They are nine in number and I sup-
pose, can be finally reduced to one, a Trinity of Trinities. The First
Trinity is the primary concept of all things which has neither begin-
ning nor end, unconditioned, therefore, boundless. For all speculative
purposes; 1, MIND. 2, SUBSTANCE. 3, MOTION. may be con-
sidered as; Intelligence or Mind; Ether or Substance; and Force or
Motion; and the outcome of this triune concept is the evolution of the
grand something upon which the entire fabric of the universe de-
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 191
pends, and this is; CONSCIOUSNESS. The impersonal becomes, as
it were, personal, and there comes into being "THE THING THAT
THINKS" apart from the universal thought. From this comes the
next or Second Trinity; 1, I am. 2, God is. 3, The Universe exists.
This is very different from the first Trinity; because it contains only
One indisputable fact, which is, I Am, this it knows. It believes that
God is and that the Universe exists. It thinks because it sees. It can
see the universe but cannot see God.
You see, we are now getting into the realm of appearances, and
this is because the Thing That Thinks, i.e., CONSCIOUSNESS, not
being the universal mind, but an entity or differentiated atom of it,
is not the universe; therefore, reduced, as it were, from knowing the
unknowable; it can only see and think, and the consequent ideas must
always depend on What it does See.
The God Idea, is simply the over-whelming conviction, the con-
sciousness of the awful powers by which it finds itself surrounded,
tremendously greater than itself.
The last Trinity is; 1, Life. 2, Change. 3, Creation, and this is at
last on earth. Everything is alive, there is no death; only change,
eternal change; and the idea, the Thing that Thinks, Creates; and is
thus a conscious microcosm patterned after the boundless, unconscious
MACROCOSM.
This is a very simple little primer of spiritual and material truth,
in which great truths, that would require big books to explain, are
reduced to their simplest, primal concepts; and while there is nothing,
beyond which, the mind of man can conceive, there is infinite space
for theories and isms to grow between the lines; but, remember, that
man has no friend but humanity; his Gods and Devils are found use-
less and powerless against the genius of man. The live, green earth,
is man's mother; and the earth and all that dwells therein are his by
the Divine right of possession. The stars of heaven look down upon
him, but there is no sympathy in their light; no companionship, in the
real sense; but the earth looks up and bids him rest. She supports
him and gives him of all she possesses of life and beauty. She pro-
duces the flowers that gladden the heart of his childhood, and the
rich harvest that gives strength to his manhood, and later she will
cover up the useless mortal part of him, beneath the green, grassy
mound of her bosom, down upon which, the distant stars, all uncon-
192 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
scious of him or his destiny, will look without pity. So, Thank God;
the great inconceivable Universal God of the Infinite Creation; that
man exists; that he lives and moves and has his being in every stage
of existence; from the living granite foundations of our mother earth
to the angelic glory that surrounds the soul and sways the Sceptre of
Ra.
God, Man and the Universe; and these three resolve into two; as
eternal mind and eternal substance or Ether. Motion itself, is only
the inter-action of these two. The great Arcana being; that, Spirit
and Matter are at last One, under different forms of expression. Mind,
alone, being eternal, and Consciousness Immortal. There is a dif-
ference between these two. Mind is God without beginning and with-
out end. The universe of mind is the sub-consciousness of Deity. And
differentiated consciousness is an individualized atom of God. It is an
evolution, per se, to which the whole universe is progressing, but to
which it can never attain the end; because, it is both illimitable in
bounds and inconceivable in results. Hence, to come back nearer to
ourselves, we see that it is in order and quite natural; that, if the
measure of consciousness attained by the evolving monad, when the
state of man is reached, does not or cannot awaken Itself to Itself, but
is only a reflection of the earthly maya; then it can have no vitality
left at death of the body to keep its grip upon the spiritual attraction
of its Ego. Its failure to realize itself, is the signature which it has
affixed to its own spiritual death warrant; and, unless, the monad
can hold on its way and finally coalesce with its Ego, it goes, like the
body, back into the universal womb and tomb of the Universe.
Life is the final mystery of God. The old philosopher who wrote
those lines knew more than appears upon the surface. It means that,
to solve the problem of life is to exhaust the mysteries of God; i.e., to
be equal to Him or It; and as this is impossible, the answer is clear,
the problem cannot be solved.
Life is motion, says science; well, so is thought; for thinking im-
plies action, mental or spiritual. All action is motion; and without
mind, existence becomes a blank. Life may be consciously or uncon-
sciously, active; but in any state it is still action; and it is only a dif-
ference of degree, between the active man and the apparently passive
rock; for life is in both. So that, to say that life is motion simply begs
the question. So likewise does the answer of the theologian; who, dog-
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 193
matically says, it is the Breath of God; since, neither he nor any one
else knows what the Breath of God is. In each and every answer, we
find the same sorry attempt to conceal ignorance by the jugglery of
words. But in spite of this, and in spite of the experiences of the
ages, in every generation, man thinks the problem capable of solu-
tion, and sets out to solve the Riddle of the Sphinx. The fully devel-
oped soul knows that the problem is and will remain, unsolved.
As I look back over the mental excursions and spiritual explor-
ations, I made into the mystical regions of the unknown, I can see
rung after rung of my spiritual ladder, still there, clear and distinct,
each stone built upon solid fact and scintillating with the light of
truth as it spans the two worlds, like stepping stones to the Infinite,
until they reach the Mystery of Life and God, or the Origin of the Vast
Universe of Being. Mind and Soul fail to go farther, and beyond this
point, not even God, He, She, or It can go; because of the ever eternal
beyond.
It is right at this point where science has the advantage of religion
and scores a grand truth. "There is no possible point in this universe,"
says Tyndall, "nor any conceivable state of existence where it can be
said, This is the End; This is the Ultimate; for there is always some-
thing beyond." The scientist, laboriously seeking the origin of life;
the theologian, attempting to define the nature of God; and the tran-
scendental mystic, seeking the Philosopher's Stone; comprise a trinity
of thinking idiots, that the world could very well do without. Each, in
his own special sphere, looks with contempt upon the other; and each
spends his time fruitlessly chasing a 'Will o' the Wisp."
Man we know; from whence he came, we know not; that is, not
in the abstract; his purpose here, we also know and we know whither
he is going; and to know all this is quite enough; but, the Why and
the Wherefore of Life, we can never know; neither here or hereafter.
The sixth Race will ray out into seven branches. The Fifth Race
was comprised of Aryan, Semetic, Slavonic, Greek, Latin, Celt and
Teutonic. The Japanese belong to the first group of the Aryan branch,
composed of a blend of the Macayan and the Mongolian families.
The Teutonic; the last blend of and of course, the highest form or
'ower of the Fifth Race; embraces all Goths, Danes, Vandals, Saxons,
l',...semen; and the finest product of the blend of Scandinavian and so-
cal.o.o} Germanic peoples, is the Anglo-Saxon; the very Hower of the
194 THE LIGIIT OF EGYPT
Fifth Race and that which will be the main matrix for the birth of the
Sixth Race.
Zanoni means; Zan, a Star; oni meaning, child of or son of; thus
Zanoni, Son of the Star. The double Ze ( ;p ) means completion.
The chasm between the soul world and the astral is just the idea
of God. God, spirit, per se, is unconscious as the spinal cord is un-
conscious. God, Ra, is the brain and at the acme of consciousness.
God, like spirituality, retreats, as it were, toward the ocean of un-
consciousness. Ra is the acme of grand intellectual consciousness; but
He has a greater than Himself; aye, many, greater than Himself; more
spiritual but less intellectual and less conscious. They too, have
greater than themselves; less in consciousness, and so on, and on, until
the great unconsciousness, the spinal cord, as it were, of the universe
is reached; but, that spinal cord is not a center, for, it is a nervous
system, penetrating everywhere. Our God is Ra, for, we would not
be, without Him. His soul's vibrations (the Sun Angels are One in
vibration with Him) called us from the great unconscious; gave us
the Breath of Life; and we are, in our inmost possibility, but images
of His; expressions of His Soul. His higher evolution depends upon
the souls, which He has drawn into Being. He is like a peak, only to
be lifted higher through the upheaval from beneath. As the souls,
that He has quickened, gain the Great Immortal vibration, I AM; as
they gain the centripetal force, that holds them in identity; as against,
the great centrifugal power that would call them back into the un-
conscious; they form with Him, the Over-Soul vibrations, of a conscious
God-Head.
Yes, Ra may fail. The world of souls that He has launched forth,
may not return in sufficient numbers; and then again, would a new
Solar Sphere be launched. So now; it is a fight for Ra, as well as for
yourself. Every spiritual conquest you make for yourself, you make
also for Ra. He is dependent on you, and you on Him. Consciousness
against unconsciousness. Ra is thus, Jehovah, the Lord of Hosts; the
manifest, visible God of this Solar System.
At a certain height from Earth all discordant vibrations unite
and concentrate with the accordant ones into one hum, one note. Each
planet, thus, has its note; and the great chord of our solar system
sounds. The Sun is the sounding board. Each Solar System is capable
of that amount of evolution, that is involved in it. Involution is the
QUOTATIONS FROM LETTERS 195
coil, the spring; so the next universe may be in a larger vibration or
it may go higher, than its own impulse, from the latent energy, not
used in the first; carried over, as it were, as capital, unused energy.
All immortal souls blend with Ra, the Supreme Seed, in becoming
Creators, with Him.
In that Angelic Sun World are found our Divine Parents.
The spirit is the Master's imagination; the tool; and the body is the
plastic material. Imagination is not fancy. Imagination is the foun-
dation of the creative faculties; while fancy is the cornerstone of
superstitution and foolishness. The imagination of man becomes preg-
nant through desire, and gives birth to deeds. We all, can educate
and regulate our imagination, and thus, contact spirits; and he taught
by them. And by living an unselfish and pure life, we can become
the mediums of good cheer to those around us. Just as the sun con-
tinually shines in the heavens, though often obscured by a veil of
clouds. Whoever fails in getting the lessons out of their experiences in
this world, just so much, will they be at a disadvantage in the next
sphere. Man's aspirations are the spiritual essences that awaken
eternal emotions. Thus proving, that, mind is universal; while will is
the attribute or faculty of the mind, for effort. It is not distinct from
the mind, but a name for a certain power which the mind possesses.
Every man, plant and animal, bears external and internal evi-
dences of the influences dominant at the moment of germinal develop-
ment. Thus proving, that, every form of life is a medium for the mani-
festation (expression) of natural forces.
We cannot cultivate Will, without Faith. They are as light and
shade, inseparable. We can accomplish a little without much Will,
but, without Faith, nothing.
Mind sleeps in the plant, dreams in the animal, and awakes in
man. In man, it becomes conscious of itself, and capable of a rela-
tively independent existence.
Thrifty Nature, surely; no prodigal, the most notable house
keeper, nothing wasted; everything utilized.

THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS
INTRODUCTION
In commencing this brief elucidation of the Astro-logos of the
Ancients it is necessary, perhaps, to inform the reader that the sys-
tem about to be elaborated is purely astro-masonic and constitutes
that special branch of the primeval "Wisdom Religion" which made
the ancient Occult Schools of Egypt and Chaldea so justly famous for
their Esoteric learning.
Astrology, per se, is a combination of two sciences, viz.: astronomy
and correspondences. These two are related to each other as hand
and glove; the former deals with suns, moons, planets and stars, and
strictly confines its researches to a knowledge of their size, distance
and motion, while the latter deals with the spiritual and physical in-
fluences of the same bodies; first upon each other, then upon the earth,
and lastly upon the organism of man. Astronomy is the external life-
less glove; correspondences is the living hand within.
It was from the mystical land of Chaldea that our Egyptian an-
cestors derived their knowledge of Astronomy and Astrology. This
knowledge was, fortunately, transplanted into good soil and flourished
for untold ages under the fostering care of her mighty priesthood and
colossal sacerdotalism.
From the fertile valley of the Nile, long ages before Abraham
and his herdsmen wandered over the desert of Arabia, this sublime
science of the starry heavens, with its priestly devotees, was carried
by tidal emigration over the Caucasus, across the arid steppes of Asia,
through the wild mountain passes of Afghanistan and Thibet to the
burning plains of Hindustan, and from thence was spread by India's
dusky sons among the Mongol and Tartar races of the still remoter
East.
Knowledge, we are told, travels westward, and, so far as Europe
and America are concerned, this is true in the present cycle. But the
time once was when this mental and intellectual current was re-
versed, and knowledge traveled eastward.
From the magical schools of the lost Atlantis, the sacred stream
of learning flowed towards the rising sun into the regions of Central
200 ·rnt:. U C IIT OF ECYI''l"
Africa, and from thence to the co.1st, up tbc Persian gulf to Chaldea,
then from the banks of the sacred Euphrates and the plains of Shinar
the stream Oowed backward (as though weary and seeking re.<t) townrd
its native home in the Western s~. only to be detained upon its
journey and to Snd a temporary resting pl1ce in the wondrous valley
of the Nile; when, after changing its personal appearance somewhat
and adopting the dress of its gifted patrons, it was again projected
onward by the restless impulse of Egyptian enterprise, along the
shores of the ~lediterrancan and Black seas to tbe Caucasus, and
thence eastward, as before mentioned, to the dreamy skies of India.
VVhcn we come to think of the nwful vastness and inoonccivnb1c
beauty of the glittering worlds which stud, like jewels, the dark canopy
of our midnight skies, undoubtedly, we mnst admit that the contcm·
plation of the shining heavens, with its myriad galaxies of starry
systems and stretch of fathomless eternities, forms a sublime study
for the thinking astronomical mind. There, alone, can he see some·
thing of the boundless affinity of the universe. But to the Occult
studunt of Urania's blazing firmament. the shining constcllntions, with
chclr c..:abftli,:,tic names J\nd weird mythologionl hi,torie$; the g littl'ring
suns of these far off astral systems; and the shining planets which
belong to the same solar family ns ourselvt"S, possess a deeper in·
tcrest. Everything around \IS, save this blazing fil'mamcnt, is in a state
of transition. Besides the 8eeting changes, which the return of the
seasons bring: tbe landscape around us is changing its aspect C\"Cry
year. In fact, all around us is change. There is nothing but one eternal
change of form. But the gorgeous creations in the sky are still there;
undimmed in brightness, unchanged in grandeur; performing, with
unflagging pace and unvarying J>recision, their daily, their annual,
and their mighty cyclic rounds. Upon the snme heavens, just as we
seo them now; bespangled with the same planets and with the snme
familiar stars: gazed ll>e first parents of our race, when they began
and also when they ended their pilgrimage upon this mundane sphere
of life. The same constellations; Arctun.ts, Orion, and the Pleiades,
sung together with the morning stars when the fiery foundations of
our c.1rtb were laid; and they rolled in the fabled darkness over Cal·
vary when the gentle Nazruine was slain. These wonders in the slc:y,
are truly the only objects which all nations have witnessed, and all
people have admired. They Me truly the only objects in the universe
THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS-INTRODUCTION 201
which have remained unpolluted by the finger of man. They pre-
sided at the Horoscope of our birth; they will sing the funeral requiem
when we die; and cast their pale radiance over the cold, silent tomb
beneath which we are ultimately destined to repose.
Before the aspiring student can become the astrologer, he must
make himself familiar with the general principles of astronomy, and
learn how to trace the external symbols of physical life, which are
the phenomenal results, back into the stellar worlds of cause. The
whole mystery of this system, therefore, may be designated in general
terms as the science of cause and effect. The text book of Astrology
by A. J. Pierce and Wilson's Dictionary of Astrology should be closely
studied as aids to obtain this knowledge.
From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that the reader must
not expect the revelation of some divine, mysterious secret that will
instantly convey the power of reading the past, realizing the influences
of the present, and foreseeing the momentous events within the womb
of the future; on the contrary, he must expect nothing but a clear and
concise statement of Nature's immutable laws, which require both
study and application to master. He will, however, find in this series
of lessons a complete exposition of the Occult principles of Nature,
in so far as they mold and guide the physical destiny of embodied
humanity. But, the principles involved and the ultimates evolved
as the natural outcome of cause and effect, can only be mastered and
understood by devoting time, unprejudiced thought, and deep study;
first, in learning the theory, and then in reducing that theory to
practice. Astrology does not imply fatality. On the contrary, probably
two thirds of man's so-called misfortunes are the result of his be-
nighted ignorance. Man, when ignorant of the laws of Nature which
control his existence and destiny, is somewhat like a lifeless log float-
ing with the stream. It may be that the various currents of the river
will carry him safely to the river's mouth, and launch him uninjured
upon the great Ocean of Eternity. But it is far more likely that the
winding course of the river of life will land him into a mud bank of
trouble where he may stick fast for the remainder of his days; or,
liberated by some stronger current, may again take his chances, either
of future safety or of floating into some whirlpool of destruction. But
when man understands the laws of his being, he is then safe on board a
strong boat. He sees the whirlpools and mud banks of life ahead, and
202 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
skillfully, by the use of his steering apparatus (the will) avoids col-
lision. But it often happens that with all his knowledge and skill he
cannot successfully battle against the mighty currents that oppose
his way, simply because there are, in these days, too many lifeless
logs of human lumber that are constantly throwing themselves with
the swell of the current athwart his path. But it must be at once
apparent to the student how infinitely superior the one is to the other,
and how enormous the chances of success are upon the side of the
one who hath attained unto wisdom; who by study, knows himself
and the laws of Nature.
The heavenly bodies urge, predispose and influence to a great
extent, but they do not compel. When we are ignorant of their power,
we decide our actions to the best of our worldly knowledge, and we
think we have free will in the matter; but, if we could only see the
influences at work moulding our actions, we should see that we were
obeying the stellar powers with slave-like servility; not always wisely,
indeed, but blindly and too well. Under such a state of bondage the
planetary influence would, indeed, be fatality. Knowledge alone is
the great liberator of human suffering, and social inharmony. Our
delivery from pain, our freedom from bondage, ·in other words, our
free will, increases exactly in proportion to the extent of our know-
ledge, if used properly. It is the Wise Man who rules.his stars, and
the fool who blindly obeys them. Consequently, this Chaldean science
of the stars, in order to be practically utilized, must be thoroughly
realized; but when realized, it will repay the student a hundred-fold
for the time and labor bestowed in learning the way. It will give him
a tangible foundation, whereon he may safely stand amid the wild
and conflicting opinions of unbalanced mystics. In it, he will find
the key of the sacred sanctuary, wherewith he may eventually unlock
the doors of the temple and penetrate the mystic veil of Isis, there,
to behold the lovely form of the Goddess and to read the glowing
verities of Nature inscribed upon the imperishable scrolls of time,
and, if he have the will to seek further and deeper, the truths of
eternity itself.
Astrology, in its purity, though forming a system of divination,
is totally u,nconnected with either fortune-telling or sensitive, irrespon-
sible mediumship. It is a divine science of correspondences, in the
study and application of which the intellect and intuition become
THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS-INTRODUCriON 203
blended in a natural, harmonious manner. They commence to vibrate
in unison. When this union becomes complete, the ignorant man be-
comes the prophetic sage.
Therefore, we would earnestly request the student of the system
herein about to be taught, to thoroughly master each principle and
detail laid down; commit them to memory so as to be able, instantly,
to recall and repeat them when necessary. Study well the Occult
principles of the science before attempting to master the external
mathematical formula; and never lose sight of the fact that no one
principle is of itself absolute, but, to become potent, requires the active
cooperation of the other forces. If these oppose with their influence,
instead of assisting, then it at once becomes a question of power
against power; if they equal each other, the influence of both becomes
nil, and the effects, instead of evolving into the realm of external life,
become crystallized within the realm of force, and die within the
womb of Nature. And lastly, remember that this ancient system of the
hoary sages, who first discovered the starry truths of the Chaldean lore,
constitutes the basic principle from which all doctrines, Occult theories,
and sacerdotal systems have radiated. Every religion under the sun
has an astrological foundation, and every science the human mind
is capable of elaborating, springs from, returns to, and ultimately
becomes lost within the starry realms of Urania.
In conclusion, therefore, we hope that our efforts to instruct the
student in these sublime mysteries will assist him to store up a supply
of precious food which will enable him to receive mental pleasure
and spiritual profit, thus proving a blessing to the body as well as the
soul.

CHAPTER I
THE PRINCIPLES OF CELESTIAL SCIENCE
"So God created man in his own image,
in his own image created he him."
Genesis, Chap. I
Man is a microcosm, a universe within himself, and as such he
is a perfect epitome of the infinite Universe, the Macrocosm. The
Chaldean sages, therefore, when constructing their mighty system of
sidereal astrology, held to this idea throughout the whole of their
philosophy. In order to penetrate the mysteries of God, they first
sought out the mysteries of man, and then, formulated a complete
science of correspondences. The Human organism, so complex in its
wonderful mechanism and so beautifully harmonious in all its parts,
became their architectural design upon which they constructed the
Grand Man of the starry heavens. The twelve signs of the celestial
zodiac were divided into sections of the human frame, so that the
entire zodiacal belt was symbolized as a man bent round in the form
of a circle, the soles of the feet placed against the back of the head.
Each of the twelve signs contain 30 degrees of space, the whole making
the 360 degrees of a circle. This 360 is the symbol of completion.
When the 3 and 6 are added together they make 9, which is the high-
est unit we possess, and as such is held to be the sacred number of
Deity. It is a triune trinity, 3 times 3.
The mystical symbolism relating to the 12 signs of the zodiac
and the human organism holds an important position in our system.
In this connection, they form the body of a musical instrument as it
were, while the sun, moon and planets constitute the strings. Our
bodies then, when astrologically considered, are merely sounding
boards for the celestial notes, struck by the starry musicians during
the performance of their celestial opera, "The Music of the Spheres."
Figure I shows what part of the human frame is ruled hy each sign.
It will be noticed that the sun and moon, through the mediumship
of their signs, Leo (S"t) and Cancer ( § ) , govern the two principal
organs, viz., the heart and the lungs. \Vhen these are in an harmonious
condition within the body the whole system is healthy; this is also
206 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
correspondingly true regarding the Grand Man of the skies, or, in
other words, the natal horoscope of the person.
More depends upon the position, aspect and power of the sun and
moon at birth, than upon all the planets of our solar system combined.
For this reason, the sun and moon are, to us, the transmitters of the
stellar forces. They act in the capacity of astral mediums and cast
their gathered or reflected potencies into our magnetic atmosphere,
harmoniously or discordantly, according as they are aspected by the
benefic or malefic rays of the major planets. The only difference be-
tween the two being, the sun is electric in its action, hence positive;
and the moon is magnetic and negative. In themselves, alone, they
are neither fortunate nor unfortunate. If these facts are remembered,
we cannot go very far wrong in our astral studies.
Man has five positive points of projection and four positive centers
of energy, thus making up the mystical nine, the symbol of Deity. In
addition to these, he has one great receptive center, which completes
the number of the Ten Sephiroth. The head, hands and feet, are the
five points of projection from which, streams of vital force are con-
stantly radiating. These five are symbolized by the five pointed star
and the five sided figure. This quintile, the Grecian symbol hygeia, was
the Pythagorean symbol of health, and when these five points radiate
their forces in straight lines from their various centers, the result is
perfect health.
The positive centers of energy within the odylic sphere are the
brain, the spleen, the heart and the generative organs, while the great
center of reception is the Solar Plexus.
When trouble or anxiety of mind crosses our path the first place
where we feel its influence is that part of the body called the pit of
the stomach. This sensitive region is within the solar plexus. How
many times do forebodings of coming trouble impress themselves
upon this delicate center? As a rule, when we are in trouble we have
no appetite; this calls forth inharmony in the various secretions of the
body. When sickness and its disagreeable correlations threaten to
take possession, keep this mighty center protected, and you have the
true secret of absolutely perfect physical health, providing you possess,
to begin with, an organism whose mental and physical forces are
evenly balanced.
The solar plexus is our grand contacting point whereby we are
THE PRINCIPLES OF CELESTIAL SCmNCE 207
placed en rapport with all things external to us. Therefore, we can
see that the true psychical basis of physical health rests with this
center; for it is taken for granted that man is, by lawful superiority,
the natural ruler of those powers whi<;:h live, move and have their
being within his own magnetic dominions. To possess true psycho-
logical power which shall be subject to the imperial will and thus be
able to assume perfect control of the odylic sphere; to concentrate
all our loyal forces, at a moment's notice, upon any particular section
of this magnetic kingdom, and thus instantly subdue any revolt of the
reactionary powers;-it is absolutely imperative that our physical bodies
be kept free and uncramped by any article of dress which restrains us
from developing our true natural forms. Mental and magnetic liberty
depends, to an extent hitherto undreamed of, upon the perfect freedom
of the physical organism. Therefore, that which cramps, binds and
warps the body out of its natural proportions, is fatal to any real
spiritual progress; because it correspondingly inharmonizes the action
of the odylic sphere. For this reason alone, India, Chaldea and Egypt
adopted the loose flowing robe; for this reason alone, is the dress of
all priesthoods loose and ample; to give them the very fullest measure
of magnetic power. Corsets and small pinching shoes have done more
to destroy the true spirituality of the present generation than all the
other causes of ignorance combined.
Anything to be truly beautiful must be truly natural. It is our
utterly false idea of so-called female beauty that is doing an incon-
ceivable amount of spiritual mischief at the present day. If our fairer
sex could only see one degree further than the limits of a depraved,
artificial fashion they would soon realize that small waists, pinched
up with corsets, make them look more like wasps than intelligent
human beings, and that small, pinched feet, with their cramped, ill-
formed toes are as much of a real deformity as a shrivelled hand or
crooked back, the only difference being, that the latter are apparent
to the external eye, and the former concealed by dress and a pair of
dainty shoes. Upon the plane of reality, our true selves, the deformity
is there and is as much the result of ignorant superstition as the maimed
limbs of Hindoo fanatics who place themselves beneath the wheels of
the car of Jagannatha. Therefore, let us impress upon each student
the absolute necessity of perfect freedom in dress. Remember that a
cramped waist means an almost useless solar plexus, and a useless solar
208 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
plexus means spiritual incapacity; spiritual incapacity means bondage
to the forces of Nature, and this slavery means becoming the helpless
medium of Nature, upon which the discordant rays of the planetary
forces can act and re-act uncontrolled. It is for this latter reason alone
that this apparent digression has been made; because the greatest value
of astrological science consists in controlling the stellar powers, or
rather, let us say, evading their malefic influences. A few more words
upon this important subject, and then we are done with it, for "verbum
sat Sapienti." The physician, the priest, and the scientist are equally
loud in their assertions that they are perfectly unbiased and open to
reason; and they are equally prejudiced and dogmatic should any one
be so foolish as to accept their invitation, and attempt to reason with
them. We are sorry to say that the fair sex are somewhat similar in
regard to their tight lacing. They will, almost without exception,
assert that they, individually, do not pinch themselves, but they will
readily admit that others do. It is really surprising how blindly foolish
we can be when we ourselves are concerned. They little dream that
the constant use of corsets retards their natural development, and,
though they may have become used to them so that they do not hurt,
but on the contrary feel comfortable; yet in real truth they are held
in a grip of iron, and are magnetically ruined. One glance at the
form around the solar plexus of a female who wears corsets, and one
who has never worn them, ought to convince the most sceptical.
When we regard the astral structure of man and closely examine
his magnetic organism, we see that he forms a beautiful oval or egg
shaped figure; the narrow end being the feet, the broad end being the
brain. This oval form constitutes the magnetic atmosphere, or, in
other words, the odylic sphere of the person, and consists of seven
concentric rays of force, each of which has a direct affinity with the
seven creative principles of Nature, and therefore, corresponds in color
to the seven prismatic rays of the solar spectrum. Each zone or ring
exercises a peculiar power of its own, and is pure or impure, according
to its state of luminosity. When mediumistic clairvoyants assert that
such and such a particular color denotes a pure and benevolent person,
or one who is depraved and sinful, they assert that which is untrue,
for each color has a special purity of its own; purity and impurity
depending entirely upon the brightness of its tint. For this reason
the animal passions, when exercised, dull and becloud the soul sphere,
THE PRINCIPLES OF CELESTIAL SCIENCE 209
while the exercise of the spiritual faculties illuminate. To better
understand these facts, see Fig. II. The brain center is represented
by a sun, the feet by a crescent moon, and the three secondary centers
of force by stars. The ingenious student can easily make this figure
complete by mentally inserting within the oval odylic sphere, the seven
prismatic color rings.
From these seven colors are formed every conceivable shade
and tint in the infinite variety of combinations, found in the infinite
variety of human beings; each and all depending upon the ever
changing positions of the stars, and also upon the corresponding
magnetic states of our atmosphere at their respective moments of
birth. The color and magnetic polarity of this odylic sphere are
fixed, quick as lightning's flash, at the first moment of our separate
material existence. This true moment is, generally, when the umbilical
cord is severed, and the child exists as a separate being, independent
of its mother. Until that time the body is polarized by the soul force
of its parent, and the planets can only influence it by reflex action
from the mother's organism. But when the tie is severed, the lungs
become inflated with the magnetic atmosphere, charged with the
stellar influx, and in an instant the whole organism thrills with the
vibrations of celestial power. These vibrations produce, in each of
the concentric rings of the sphere, the exact tint and shade of color
corresponding to the harmonious or discordant rays of the heavens
at the time.
These vibrations, once in action, retain their special polarity
for the whole tenor of earthly existence. They form the key note
of the musical instrument which is ever sounding forth the harmony
or discord of its material destiny. This key note is either high or
low according to the particular influences which may be operating
upon it at the time. At one time the life forces may be so low that
the note will be too faint for the most sensitive clairaudient to detect;
at other times the throbbing pulsations of life will be so strong with
physical vitality that it will swell into the highest octave, and launch
forth such potent health giving vibrations as to affect other bodies
near it, and draw therefrom responsive vibrations, thus giving life
and health to others, in harmony with but weaker than itself. But,
should the bodies with which it comes in contact be naturally an-
tagonistic to it, in temperament and magnetic polarity, then, instead
210 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
of responsive harmony, their contact will produce fierce jarring
commotions of discord to the detriment of both, the weaker being
the greater sufferer.
The action and inter-action of planetary influx upon the human
being after birth is determined upon the same lines. When a planet,
by its progressive motion reaches a point on the sphere where it forms
an inharmonious angle with the angular vibrations set in motion
at birth, magnetic discord is produced. This magnetic storm, so to
say, awakens and sets in motion the cosmic and other elementals
corresponding in their nature to the primary cause, and external mis-
fortune and trouble are the material results; and vice versa, should
the planets form benefic rays, etc. This is the true secret of planetary
influence so far as what is termed good and bad luck. It is magnetic
harmony or discord.
From the above, the student will see what a fearful mistake so
called ..Christian Scientists" and metaphysical healers make, unless
they truly understand the Occult principles of Nature. It is utterly
impossible for antagonistic natures to benefit each other mentally,
no matter how good or pure they, as individuals, may be. To attempt
to do this is like trying to make oil and water harmonize; this is
the true secret of the mental healer's lack of success with certain
individuals.
For example, any person hom under and controlled by the
Martial electricity, which corresponds to the element of fire, will
prove antagonistic ·by nature to anybody and everybody who is
governed by the Saturine principle. They .will not blend and mingle.
The most gentle and loving spirit that it is possible for the healer
to exercise under such circumstances will recoil from the odylic sphere
of the other like a thunderbolt, and the mental physician will feel
this recoil and want of success, right in the center of the solar
plexus. The science of the stars alone contains the real secrets of
the healing art divine.
CHAPTER II
THE SOLAR FORCE
"And the Lord set a mark upon Cain
lest anyone finding him should kill him."
Genesis, Chap. IV
At this stage it is necessary to explain several matters of great
importance in forming a true conception of astral law. The reader
must not suppose that the planets are the primary causes of the
fortunes and misfortunes which fall to the lot of mankind generally.
This is by no means the case; for the primary cause has its origin
within the soul sphere of our parents. The sexual relationship between
man and woman has its laws, its harmonies and discords. It is man's
duty to investigate, learn these laws, and follow them, especially
so when we bear in mind the fact that there is neither morality
nor sentiment in the cold inflexible justice of Nature. "Unto every
violation of the law there is meted out a penalty." If the attributes
of a thief are conceived, a thief will ultimately be born into the
world. It matters not what the circumstances or position in life may
be, that individual so conceived will be a thief in his heart, and will
commit thefts upon some plane or other. Remember, there is no
real difference, except in magnitude, between the man who legally
by some commercial sharp practice steals a railroad; and the one
who, to support his position in life and before the world, lives above
his income to the detriment of his creditors; or the poor devil who,
under the influence of criminal temptations, robs a bank or steals
your watch. All three, when viewed in their true light, are natural
born thieves, and each equally deserving, if justice were impartial,
of the same term of penance in the house of correction. The false
glamor and artificial conventionalities of modern society, however,
praise and bow down in adoration to the gifted railroad thief; they
pity and condole as unfortunate the man who, by living above his
honest income, terminates his career in bankruptcy; but they, with
neither pity nor mercy, hurry off to the jail and the treadmill the
poor wretch who steals a watch or robs a bank of a few paltry dollars,
when, as a rule, it is this one who is most deserving of our sympathy.
Ignorance and a neglected childhood may have intensified the evil
212 niE UCIIT OF tx:Y'PT
influences of his conception and birth to an inconceivable extent,
and he might, if the world would only let him, become a better and
wiser man. It is equally in aooordance with the same immutable
laws that every species of crime is hom into the world. When inflamed
passions and cruel thoughts are latent within us, and remain un-
controlled by the higher self during the conjugal union, we must
not be surprised if a child with a similar nature is conceived. When
such is the case, there is no benevolent Cod to graciously interfere
and prevent a criminal from being launched upon socict)•.
Man has the privilege and possesses the possibilities of choosing
the good, and preventing the conception of evil. Therefore if he.
either from choice or ignorance, prefers to risk all the naharal conse·
quences, Mother Nature. who is no respecter or persons:, will write
murderer across tho brow or the unborn infant io characters ns
indelible as the mark she inflicted upon Cain.
When the embryonic potentialities of a human soul a.re launched
forth into the matrix they remain there, slowly evolving their organic
powers. and nre imprisoned within the womb until their magnetic
as well as their physical, period of gestation is completed. Nor is
it possible for a child to be born and live until the astral inOux
corresponds exactly to the external polarity o£ the soul. Only when
the heavens :\re harmonious can that which we term good become
manifest upon the earth. Under the opposite condition of the hen,•ens.
evil. so called by comparison, becomes externalized.
From the foregoing it will be seen that we are, to a very great
extent, what the ignorance or wisdom of our ancestors have made
us. As the wol'ld progresses, mankind obtains more knowledge.
Thus do the rising generations become wiser than their parents.
This mental evolution moves forward until tho intellectuality of
the race becomes exhausted: then, for a time, mankind remains
stationary, and at length declines from the summit of its genius to
relapse into an ignorant barbarism: when, having regained a SUllply
of latent mental Force. the race once more advances, ultimately,
to attain unto a still greater perfection than before. Thus do intellectual
forces correspond in their apparent motion to the motions o£ the
planets, becoming alternately direct, swift, stationary and retrograde.

change. They move in greater cycles only. Their climax of civiliza-
tion corresponds to the flowering season of the vegetable kingdom;
then they run to seed and decay. But in the same racial soil is
treasured up the precious seed from the flowers, which, lying dormant,
awaits the necessary magnetic and spiritual conditions for its glorious
unfoldment.
The stars and planets are the magnetic instruments of the seven
creative principles. They influence externally, by their attractive
sympathies and repulsive antipathies, the cosmic life forces and
physical organisms of precisely the same objects, which, in the realm
of spirit, are controlled by their celestial progenitors. By this we
mean that the various physical orbs, called planets, stars, etc., act
as so many magnetic centers. They are magnetic by solar induction.
The sun, itself, is not magnetic, but positively electric. This mighty
electric force acts upon the planets precisely the same as an electric
current acts upon a piece of soft iron. When a piece of iron is charged
with electricity it becomes at once a magnet, its power depending
first upon its mass and secondly upon the strength or intensity of
the electric current. Shut off the current and the iron ceases to be
a magnet. Remove the sun from our system and the planets will
immediately lose their peculiar physical influence. Modern science,
we know, would contradict this assertion, but Occult science pro-
claims it to be an absolute fact.
The sum total of those powers which we term "planetary
influences," is contained within the potentiality of the Solar Ray.
But when so united, as a primal cosmic force, the action of this
solar ray upon the human organism and its material destiny is neither
harmonious nor discordant, fortunate nor unfortunate. To become
potent, in special directions, it is necessary for this solar force to
become refracted and resolved into its active attributes. This is
precisely what the major planets do. There are six planets, each of
which absorbs a single attribute or principle; each one according
to its peculiar nature and absorbing affinity. While the solar orb
itself retains but one active energy whose potency is embraced within
the orange ray of the spectrum. This influence, of course, relates
only to the special action of the seven active principles, and does
not refer to the solar light reflected by each body, and emitted bv
the sun itself. Five planets, besides the sun and moon (our earth),
214 111£ UCJrT OP ECYPr
absorb the seven rays. The other planets react upon higher planes.
That is to say, they radiate one of the same forces upon a higher
octave. Each of the planetary bodies, having become magnetically
charged with their own spcdal enctgy, are powcl'ful radiators of
the same attribute which tht..•y hnvc I'Cccived from their solar parent.
These energies posse.'5 a distinctive motion, color and potency. each
peculiar to itself, which, whrn C
.\:tcrnalizcd upon man's internal
nature, produce a marked contrast in his mental oncl physical char-
acteristics, briefly, as follows.
TilE PLAX£'1' SATURN ?
Saturn absorbs that attribute or energy whose action expresses it-
self as coldness, and thus produces a nature which is slow and medi-
tative. solitary and reserved, melancholy and reJ
>Ciltnnt. This force
corl'esponds to the hluc ray of the spectrum.
1'111~ llt.AJ\'£1' JUPITER l!
jupiter absorbs a totally different energy than the Saturnine and
radiates an inftuencc at once jovial. A happy medium between the
fast and the slow, the meditati"c and the thoughtless, the isolated
hermit and tl>c one too eas)' of access. The inlluence is cheerful, gen-
erous, benevolent, and sheds light and love upon all material sur-
roundings. This force corresponds to the purple or indigo rR)' of the
spectrum.
Tilt~ PLANP.T MARS d
Mars absorbs an energy which is the polar opposite of the Sat-
urnine, and therefore radiates an influence which is shnrp, energetic.
thoughtless, intrepid and fierce. It is destitute of either fear or timid-
ity. An influence which is free with everything and everybody.
Drie8y stated, the force of the planet Mars is fiery, imperious. com-
bative in the first degree. hloodthirsly and unrelenting. This energy
corresponds to the red ray of the spectrum.
'nl& S\1!< 0
The Sun retains and rndiotes the princi;>
le which is at once life-
giving and dignified. Just as Jupiter is a compound or happy medium
between the energies exerted by Saturn and Mars. sO tloc Sun sends
forth an inAucnce which is the happy medium between Jupiter and
Mars. It is affahle but majestic: proud. but gracious: nnd blends
1'HE SOLAR FORCE 215
firmness with kindness. ambition with paternal consideration, com·
bativeness with self-respect, and liberality with discretion. As before
stated, this influence corresponds to the orange ray of the spectrum.
TltE l'LANET VENUS 9
Venus absorbs an energy which is totally different from any of
the preceding, and radiates ..the love element" of Nature. This in·
fluence is warm and impulsive interiorly, but externally cool and
moist, consequently pliable and receptive, clinging and feminine. It
is the energy which ever yields to a nature more positive than its own
with loving submission; hence tl1e myths of the friendships between
Mars and Venus. This energy corre.<ponds to the yellow ray.
TI-lE PLAN£T MEl\CUR\' ~
.\·Jercury absorbs an energy which, in a general sense. appears to
be a compound of all the othe• planets of the spectrum put together;
hence he has been well designated as "the messenger of tl1e gods."
The specific action which this orb radiates is purely intellectual and
scientiGc. It is quick and uctivo, intuitiona.l. enterprising. careless,
volatile, bright, changeable, and what we call smart. This inBuence
is extremely inventive, and is the originator of all cunning schemes
and devices. It is what men term bright and witty. It is that which
makes the live man of commerce, and constitutes the leading inBu·
ence embodied within that sharp, clever and chamelion-like individual
who makes a fortune in the real estate business. This energy corre·
sponds to the violet ray of the solar spectrum.
THE MOON )
The planet upon which we live, move, and have our being, ab·
sorbs an energy which we, as inhabitants, cannot by nature fully
understand or appreciate, because we only receive this energy as an
astral influx by the reflective action of our Earth's satellite, the Moon.
This inftuence, so far as we, the planet's offspring. are concerned. is
neither good nor evil; because it is part and parcel of ourselves. What
the influence may be upon the inhabitants of other worlds we cannot
say. Therefore, when speaking astrologically, we credit the Moon's
reflective power and speak of that body as containing our Earth's at·
tribute of the solar ray. This energy corresponds to the green ray of
the solar spectrum.
216 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
The foregoing are the seven active principles of Nature, but the
ingenious students will notice that two of the major planets have not so
far been noticed; we refer of course to Uranus ( W) and Neptune ( W),
each of which radiate one of the same forces upon a higher octave.
Each of the seven principles enumerated have three planes of action;
the spiritual, the astral and the physical. After the seven notes of the
magnetic gamut have been sounded, the next note must be upon a
higher octave and form a repetition of the first. The first scale being
known and its effects understood, it is not necessary for the Occult
initiate of these astral powers to wait, for the years of observation
necessary to others, in order to tabulate a newly discovered planet.
By the laws of correspondences he know at once what that planet's
action upon the human organism will be. There is still another planet,
more remote from our sun than Neptune, but its action on our organ-
ism at present is nil; because the present races have not yet attained
to that special state of spiritual and mental development that will ad-
mit of its influence becoining manifest. Neither will such a planet
become visible to this Earth's inhabitants until there is sufficient mental
force of the requisite grade to enable its existence to become apparent.
Such are the sublime facts of Nature's immutable law, that
have made the science of astrology true for all time and in all ages.
\Vhen Uranus and Neptune were shining in their distant heavens un-
discovered, mankind was, as a body, impervious to their action. Man's
organism did not vibrate in unison with their higher state of action.
Thus we see, as man evolves higher powers, more ethereal orbs ap-
pear in the celestial hierarchies of the starry heavens for the purpose
of controlling and directing him.
The action and inter-action of the planetary influences operate in
the following order;-Saturn ( T;> ), Jupiter ( U: ), Mars ( t ), Sun ( 0 ),
Earth ($),Venus ( <» ), and Mercury ( l;1 ). These are the seven pri-
maries. Then comes Uranus ( Ttl ) , forming the eighth, or octave expres-
sion of the first, or Mercury, and thus do we find, after long years of re-
search and laborious investigation, that this planet rules the higher
organs of the brain. Neptune, consequently, represents Venus upon
a higher plane. The Earth, whose influence is shown by the Moon,
comes next in rotation. \Vhen the tenth planet is discovered, its ac-
tion upon our Earth's inhabitants will be neutral in itself. Its har-
monies and discords will depend upon its angular position in respect
THE SOLAR FORCE 217
to the other bodies. Its chief influence will be in the control of our
spiritual life forces. Its position, aspect, etc., with respect to the lu-
minaries, will determine our capacity for inhaling the £ner ethereal
essences of the atmosphere. From this it will be perceived that the
influence of the tenth planet will be wholly spiritual; hence, it can only
exert its influence upon the spiritual organisms of a more spiritual
race.
This chapter contains a brief outline, so to speak, of the interior
action of the planets. We shall deal with each orb more fully and in
detail from their general standpoint in future lessons, and as a con-
cluding suggestion we would ask the student to think and reason out
very closely what we have herein stated by the light of the law of
correspondence, the sum and substance of which was formulated for
our use by the thrice illumined Hermes Trismegistus, who said:
"As it is above, so it is below,
As on the earth, so in the sky."

CHAPTER III
INFLUE;\"CE OF STELLAR FORCE
Having briefly explained, in the previous chapter, the origin, na-
ture and power of planetary influence, so far as the planets themselves
are concerned, it now becomes our duty to illustrate, somewhat, the
principles laid down, and point out the laws or modus operandi by
which these influences act and react upon the brain of man, and
through the brain, control the whole organism. In order to do this we
shall have to digress a little.
Phrenological research has now established beyond dispute cer-
tain broad general principles regarding cranial development. But,
the great mistake which the devotees of this branch of Anthropology
make, is that they allow their enthusiasm to carry them beyond the
safe line of demonstrated facts. They are constantly trying to prove
that, by the aid of phrenology, they can ascertain the details of man's
character; whereas, the very utmost that can be expected as scientific-
ally accurate, is a delineation of the general characteristics.
Phrenology merely points out those relations established by Na-
ture between given developments and conditions of the brain, and
corresponding manifestations of mind. Its simple but comprehensive
tenet is this: "Every faculty of the mind is manifested by means of
a particular portion of the brain, called its organ; the size of which,
other things being equal, is proportionate to its power of function."
It is the latter portion of this definition that contains the whole mys-
tery of the apparent contradictions with which the phrenologist has
to deal. The "other things" are never, in any two cases, equal; hence,
the exact action of the brain organs cannot be scientifically demon-
strated. As soon as phrenology attempts to define with exactness a
person's true character or the powers of the cranial organs, from a
simple knowledge of the size of these organs, it becomes a complete
failure. The potency, or otherwise, of any organ or group of organs,
depends not nearly so much upon their relative size as upon their
sensitiveness, or, in other words, upon the state of their etherealiza-
tion; and this magnetic condition depends solely upon the position
and power of that planet which has chief rule over those particular
220 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
organs. Decisive proof of this assertion, as regards the size of the
organs, may be obtained by each student for himself, by carefully
noting the heads of individuals. Even among our own personal ac-
quaintances we shall find that it is not an absolute fact that those
who possess the largest heads have the most brains, but often the
very reverse. In fact, we shall find that the majority of men dis-
tinguished in science, politics and literature are those who possess
comparatively small but well balanced heads, combined with a fine,
highly sensitive organism, while the ordinary citizen or farmer, who
is utterly incapable of forming any opinion worth listening to be-
yond the value of his whiskey, his hogs or his cattle, is possessed of a
large head filled, not with intellectual brains, but with coarse animal-
ized "brain stuff" which is utterly incapable of manifesting its powers
upon the higher mental planes of our nature.
The old and now much abused Chaldean sages were thoroughly
acquainted with these facts, and in order to teach these principles to
their youth, they elaborated beautiful imagery in the form of fables
and allegories. They gave the nature and power of each group of
organs in the human brain to the character of that planet which they
knew controlled its activities, and then worked out the facts, so
elaborated, into a series of mythical histories of gods and divine per-
sonages, who incarnated themselves for the benefit of man. Thus Mars
took the character of Vulcan, the god of war; Venus and her innocent
companion Cupid were assigned the character of Love and the
sympathetic tendencies of the human heart, while the benevolent
Jupiter assumed the position of Father, the kindly, generous parent,
good alike to all his offspring, and so on with the others.
From this, the student will perceive that when they taught their
children that their gods had existed in human bodies, they did not
mean to convey the idea of Divine incarnation as we understand the
doctrine, but that a portion of the divinity, a refracted ray, had be-
come centered in man, and expressed itself in some special form;
thus, a great warrior who brought honor and riches to his tribe or
country, through his brilliant victories, was properly considered a son
of Mars, because his nature expressed the Martial spirit in what was
considered its highest and most potent form. A key to this beautiful
Chaldean system will be found in the Astro Phrenological Chart on
page 218 of this chapter. The seven principles therein shown are, of
INFLUENCE OF STELLAR FORCE 221
course, only general, and indicate those groups of organs over which
the planets indicated are most powerful. To descend more into
details:
THE PLANET SATURN ?
Saturn governs the activities of the reflective, meditative and the
purely selfish sentiments, such as comparison, causality, covetousness,
acquisitiveness and secrecy.
THE PLANET JUPITER 2..!
Jupiter governs those activities which, in their expression, show
to us the truly noble and generous side of human nature, such as benev-
olence, veneration, spirituality and hope.
THE PLANET MARS ~
Mars has chief rule of those activities which generally express
themselves as selfishly aggressive. Properly, they are the passions
which reveal to us the animal which resides in an active or semi-
passive state, within each human soul, upon the material plane of ex-
ternaJ life. They are known as alimentiveness, destructiveness, com-
bativeness, and the sexual propensities. To these may be added
vitativeness and construction.
THE SUN 0
The Sun has the chief control of those organs whose activities
express themselves in man's higher nature as the "Lord" of material
creation. They comprise the commanding and dignified elements
within us, such as firmness, conscientiousness, pride, approbativeness,
and self-esteem.
THE PLANET VENUS ~
Venus governs those faculties whose activities express them-
selves as friendship, mirthfulness and conjugality. It also governs the
organs of inhabitiveness and those which tend to form agreeable
society.
THE PLANET MERCURY l;l
Mercury, in addition to being the general messenger of the gods,
rules those faculties whose activities are purely intellectual and
mechanical, such as eventuality, indlviduality, size, form, weight,
color, order, calculation and language.
22~ TilE LIC:II'I' Of-' lle\'M.
TJJE .\I ()()X )
Tile ~loon gO\'Ctrb those organs whose <~ctivitic.s are termed the
M:mi-intcllt'Ctual <1ualrtit.~. The)' :uc very desirable e."tpression.s of
chamcter, viz.: time, tune, ideality and sub1imit)'· She ha~ also in-
Aucncc over the domestic qualities.
Each of tl1e foregoing groups of o•·gnns is, to a very great extent
controlled by the planet und~r which il is mcntio•>ed, but not wholl)•
so, because every orb has an inAucncc in a minor degree over each
and all. Dut generally speaking, each group will manifest an intense
or sluggish action in the brain, according as its controlling orb is pow-
erful or otherwise, in the individual's horoscope at birth, wilh this
difference in its action: if the planet in question be powerful IJut
evilly aspccted, then those orsans will express the vicious side of tbe
person's nature. For example, the plnnct Mercury so situated, the
intellect will be bright, witty and powerful, but all the energies, under
prnt)Cr condition.<, will be devoted to fraud, or nt any rate, to very
questionable purpOS<'S; evcryd1ing depending upon the plane that the
penon occupies. A~ heforc stated. there is no diO'crcnce between
the criminal who breaks the legal code of laws, and tin; one wltu, upou
a higher plane, obeys the written letter of the law, but tramples upon
the true principles of human justice. The wealthy gambler upon the
stock exchange, is no better in rclllity than the gllmbling card sharper.
Dut, if the planet is dignified and aspccted by bcnc6c rays, then the
whole of the above will be reversed, and all that is noble, honomble
and manly will be the result.
Having mentioned aspects, it now becomes our duty, briefly, to
explain their nature. This weshall do in outline, at pre.~ent, deferring all
details until later.
From what we have aJrc~dy stated, our $'t11dcnt will percch·<' that
sympathy and antipathy are the ~:real laws by which the planets af-
fect the human organism. These two forces, or rather let us say the
dual action of this one force, constitutes the two modes of motion by
which ever)• cosmic principle expresses itself. and the two actions,
that is, the action and the reaction, ore tn•e polar opposities, of which
sufficient has alrendy been stated. Upon the physic:~! plane their effects
arc correlated as harmony and discord.
INFLUENCE OF S'J'EL.LA.E t-'O.RCE 223
224 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
That nothing, apart from Deity, which has a manifested existence,
can exist without form, is a self evident fact, which scarcely requires
proof. Therefore, the powers of harmony and discord possess forms
which are peculiar to themselves. These forms in Astrological science
are angular, and are denominated aspects. the more perfect or com-
plete the angle is, the greater the power its influence exerts upon
matter. The symbol of discord is a square, and every inharmonious
angular ray constitutes a portion of the square or the angle of 90
degrees. The symbol of harmony is a triangle, and every benefic
angular ray constitutes a portion of the trine or angle of 120 degrees;
thus we have a geometric expression of evil and good, as shown
helow.
The
Angle
of
Sorrow
The student will observe that the discordant rays of magnetic
force strike each other crossways from opposing angles, thus +. This
conflict produces a violent commotion. There is a fight, as it were,
in the current between two powers, while the contrary result is pro-
duced in the action of the benfic rays of magnetic force. They impinge
upon each other, thus, Y, like the two forks of a river, and then,
with their united force How onward harmoniously. The whole of
these angular aspects are illustrated in the diagrams on the adjoining
page. Explanation is unnecessary, except that each aspect can be
formed from any point of the celestial zodiac, both direct and converse.
·we see, therefore, that when the combinations of stellar force
How in straight lines and cut through each other from cross angles,
the resultant upon the physical plane is that state which we term
discordant and evil. But, when the rays of force How in straight but
convergent angles from or towards each other, then the opposite
effects are naturally produced, and harmony, love and prosperity
reign.
The student cannot pay too much attention to these Occult facts
of Nature's law, because they are true upon every plane of mani-
fested existence.
CHAPTER lV
The ne.xt great subject which requires the student's thoughtful
attention is the four Triplicities. These trigons correspond to the
four ~neicnt elem~nts, and are therefore, Fiery, Earthy, Airy nnd Wa-
tery. Each triplicity or "Trigo•n" contains three zodiacal signs. 4 times
3 equals 12, the number of the signs o£ the sphere. The Fiery trigon
embraces the signs of AriC» ( 'r ), Leo (.It), and Sagittarius ( ,« ). The
Earthy trigon embra= the signs Taurus ( IS), \'irgo ( IIJ!), and Capri-
corn (113). The Airy trigon embrace< the signs Gemini ( JJ: ), Libra
( .... ), and Aquarius (:). The Watery trigon embraces the signs
C:meer (§),Scorpio ( 111. ),n111d Pisces (*),also s<•e page 399, Wilson's
l)ictionary of Astrology.
In practiml astrology these triplicities are o£ very great import-
uncc, as they shed their pownt influence upon the ascendant at the
IJirth of every living being or thing, and impress their pccuHnr nature
U(lOfl the t cmpcml'fiCilt o£ the native. The philo:o.vtJllil..:ul vrincipl~
concealed beneath these so·callcd ancient clements, arc worthy o£ a
far more detailed elucidation than the space or this chapter will admit.
Probably one of the grc.l tcst mistakes made b)• the modem un-
initiated astrologer in regard to the actual inOuence or these triplic-
ities, is that they omit to take into consideration the ascent and
descent of the spirit<Oal cthct'cali•~,tion of material forces.
Magnetic and electric forces vary in their spil'itunlity like every-
thing else in the univers<'. Thnt which is supcriol', hy virtue of ils
higher or more interior cm3nation, will demonstrate its superiority
upon every plane of its manifestation. For example; Aries ( 'l') is the
first and highest representaliivc or the fiery trigon, and those born
with this sign rising upon th~ ascendant of their horoscope ''
"'ill always
move upon a higher plane, mentally and spiritually, than those born
under Leo or Sagittarius. But, externally, those people born under
Aries will show their superiority from a purdy intellectual point o£
view. Their nature will he, chicRy, f'icty a.nd nu~nt:•l. consequently
{1
uick in nction. and prompt in decision.
Leo (st ), the next to Aries, is the second representative of the
fiery trigon. and persons horn with this sign rising. will always move
226 THE UCHT OF EC\'PT
upon the sensitive and emoticonal planes. Their nature will be chieHy
fiery and sensitive, consequently, hasty and impulsive. They will act
without thinking, on the spur of the moment, when under the dom-
inating inlluence of their suseeptible, emotional natures. In this, we
see the difference behveen Aries, which rules the head, and Leo,
which represents the heart. Leo persons, when roused to a pitch of
passional fury, are absolutely insane in their wild and erratic actions.
Like the lion, they are completely blinded by an intense degree of
excitement. On the contrary, an Aries person, though susceptible of
an equal degree of furious te1mper, never becomes blind with excite-
ment. Even in his most outrag;eous conduct, an impartial observer will
not fail to see that "there is method in his madness."
Sagittarius is the last and lowest, that is to say, the most external
emanation of the fiery triplieity, and illustrates the law of contradic-
tions to perfection. For this reason, those born under this sign Jive
and move, when mentally aml spiritually considered, upon the lo"'cst
plane of the fiery emanation. Whereas externally and in the eyes of
the world, they seem to move• in the very highest. Their natures are
warm, sympathetic and activ•
e, consequent))' they are generous and
benevolent, ambitious and truly jovial. They do as the world doos;
they progress not of their own internal volition, but by the gentle at-
traction of the social tide of tl..eir surroundings. In everything they are
external. They are great admirers of all out-door sports, recreations
and pastimes, and as such, they are totally incapable of grasping any
form of tho higher mental and! metaphysical studies. They are, there-
fore, considered by the masses and the world sound, logical, reasoners.
and possessed of sound comm•on sense, and externally they do indeed
possess all these desirable qualities.
When viewed from their line of descent, tho student will per-
ceive~ that in Aries we have the Ser>' imperial brain, which moulds,
guides and acts for itself, inderpendent of the opinions of others. Such
exheme natures. when unm()diSed by other influence."i, are either
de.o;:pots, cranks or fanatics, according to their bent and station in life.
In Leo, we sec the emotions a:nd sensitive feelings of the heart, which
follow, impulsively, the lead of some mental genius, and form the
enthusiastic followers and admirers of those who depart from the
beaten path of custom. or proclaim some new truth or system of
philosophy, which Snds a responsive throb within thorn. But, they
INTER-ACriON OF THE STARS 227
require the thinking brain to direct them; they cannot strike out upon
a new path for themselves; they must have some giant mind to sup-
port them. In Sagittarius, we see the genial, sympathetic, courteous,
neutrality which represents the externally true gentleman. Those who
are simply waiting to be led in any direction that the strongest mental
force desires to carry them. They love the world and its varied de-
lights, and are, consequently, contented and willing to let others do
the thinking for them.
The whole of these remarks are to be considered in a general
sense only, and in speaking of any given sign it is, of course, presup-
posed that the position and aspect of the sun, moon, and planets do
not contradict the general tendencies of the sign upon the ascendant.
Further, what we have thus far stated in reference to the fiery trigon
will also apply to the other triplicities. It is, therefore, quite unneces-
sary to go over the same ground with each trigon, as the above il-
lustration will suffice to explain the varying powers of each sign, ac-
cording to the peculiar plane of its manifestation, as Earthy, Airy and
Watery. The student has only to bear in mind, when forming his
opinion, that his premises and his conclttsions must occupy the same
plane. Thus, the fiery trigon manifests itself in the combative, ag-
gressive, imperious, commanding and courageous planes of action.
The earthy trigon manifests itself in the patient, laborious, plod-
ding, obedient and inert planes of action. The airy trigon manifests
itself in the aspiring, philosophical, musical, artistic and volatile
planes of action. The watery trigon manifests itself in the dreamy,
romantic, changeable, timid and submissive planes of action.
As before stated, the student must understand that these remarks
are general and not particular in their application; for instance, we
do not mean to assert that because a person is born under a watery
sign rising upon the ascendant, that, that person will be dreamy and
romantic, or impractical and submissive. This will depend entirely
upon the actual position of the planets and their aspects to the sun
and moon at the time of birth. But what we do mean to assert is this;
that the person then born will possess, deep down and latent, the
qualities of the watery trigon, and that under proper conditions and
circumstances, it will rise dominantly to the surface and thus mani-
fest the true internal characteristics of the person's nature, while the
same conditions and circumstances brought to bear upon one born
:228 "niE LICIIT OF EGYPT
under the fiery trigon would operate in exactly the reverse direction.
Thus we see how and why two different individuals, under the same
identica] conditions, will differ diametrically in their course of ac-
tion. Every day adds fresh proof of this.
\Ve must now turn our at(ention to the purel}' esoteric aspect of
the fou1· ttiplicitics, and view them from tlwir Hermetic and Occult
standpoint. The four ancient elements; Azoth, Salt, Sulphur, and
~lcrcury, have been S)'mbolh~cd from tirne irnmcmorial, as Tho Man.
The Bull, The Lion, and The Eagle. Astrologically these are; Aquar-
ius (:) "the water bearer," symbolical of The Man; Taurus ( tl) the
sign of The Bull; Leo ($1.) rc):resented by The Lion; and lastly Scor-
pio ( 111.) anciently symbolized by The Eagle. ln this change of svmbols
the thoughtful student will 6nd much that is well worthy of his care-
ful consideration, for "hereby hangs a tale." In the esoteric plani-
sphcre of the twelve signs, Ad~m Kadrnon, the pritnordial man, pure,
and in perfect accord with the Father, occupied that point of the
planisphere now designated by the sign Libra (.,), which signifies the
point of cqnilihrium in the .o:phcrc. T his eseltt>ric point is whcrP. cl::ly
and night, winter and summer, light and darkness, good and evil are
one. Adam Kadmon represents the ideal man, and the very fttct that
we can form an ideal conception is the absolute proof that we pos·
sess the possibilities of attaining unto the ideal and realizing our con-
ception, not perhaps upon this plane, but certainly, when we are trans·
lated to the higher. The modern English 11amc for this point of the
sphere, ''The Balance," which means justice. is a fitting one, as Jus-
tice is that which discriminates, upon the external plane, hetwccn
good and evil, and metes out rewards and punishments. Life. Light
and Truth arc the SilfllC, and consist of $piritua1 reRcction. They are
spiritual rays) and when these rays become refracted hy passing
through the prism of matter, Truth becomes illusion. Life becomes
limited by assuming the appeara nce of death, and Light bc~'Omcs ob-
scured . This thought is clearly expressed by S. S. Grimke in her book
Esoteric Lessons, und<
•r the s11bject '"First Lessons in Reality." The
spiritually be-autiful and eternally true. have no existence in this
world where all is change, sttifc, d iscord and death, therefore, we
sec that the divine spiritual ray of good, when it hccorncs r·cfractcd .
presents all the forms and colors of evil. the former only, is real
INTER-ACTION OF THE STARS 229
and eternal, and the latter is but an appearance, assumed by the
fleeting transformations of matter.
This celestial point in Libra is represented by Enoch, in the
mysteries of the Jewish Temple, the man who walked with God "and
was not." This theological idea was plagiarized by the early fathers
of the Chri~tian Church, when they elaborated their Christian mys-
teries. They make Libra symbolical of their day of judgment, when
celestial "justice" will be meted out to all, "both the quick and the
dead." This is the point of the planisphere occupied by their divine
man. The Cabalistical Adam Kadmon, the Enoch of Judaism, be-
comes the Emmanuel of the new dispensation. Jesus is the sacrifice
required by the divine justice of God's anger (?) for the awful errors
of a sinful world of His own creation and management. And Judas,
who as a disciple of the son of God, was able to soar heavenward upon
the wings of an Eagle (the inward aspirations) falls into temptation,
and betrays his master into the hands of his murderers. Thence comes
the fall, the divine Eagle of the celestial heavens, becomes the lowly
reptile, the treacherous, poisonous scorpion, whose sting is concealed
in the most unsuspected part of the body, viz., the tail.
The above will be found useful in the Esoteric translation of signs
into principles. The fall, from the Eagle of the heavens to the scor-
pion of the desert, also applies to the theological fall of man, and
scientifically explains the Biblical allegory of Adam and Eve. When
the mystic key of the starry heavens is turned with a wise hand, the
garden of Eden is no longer an impossible place, but is a divine real-
ity, and the four rivers which, we are told, branch from one head,
which rises in the midst of the garden, can all be located and their
virtues known.

CHAPTER V
ALCHEMY, THE STARS AND MAN
By Nature the Zodiac is divided into equal arcs of Light and
Darkness, Summer and Winter; which in the technical terms of the
science are termed the northern and the southern signs. When the
Earth, in her annual orbit round the sun, enters the sign Libra, about
the 21st. of March, the sun appears to enter the first degree of Aries,
which is called the vernal equinox, and following the opposition
point of our earth's journey through space, our sun apparently moves
forward through the signs until (about the 21st. of June) the first
point of the tropical sign Cancer is reached, and the greatest noon-
day altitude is attained in the northern hemisphere, and the lowest
in the southern hemisphere.- On or about the 21st. of September, the
sun appears to enter the first degree of Libra, which completes the
solar passage through the six northern signs, and the arc of light is
over. The following six signs, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn,
Aquarius and Pisces, constitute the southern arc, termed the arc of
darkness. Our chief reason for drawing the student's attention to this
preculiar division of the zodiac is, that, it is this division that forms
the ground work upon which is based every theological system the
world has ever seen. Further, it is the division still observed in all
standard works upon Astrological science. But, so far as the real and
practical application of the science is concerned, such a division is
perfectly unmeaning, and students are advised to pay no attention
thereto. The only division the zodiac receives in Chaldean astrology
(except the four triplicities) is that which takes into consideration the
increase and decrease of the life forces, of the great cosmic life cen-
ter of all animated nature, viz., the Sun. The zodiac is, therefore,
divided into two parts, viz., from Capricorn to Cancer. When the sun
crosses the line of the winter solstice, about the 21st. of December,
the life forces of the northern hemisphere are at the lowest ebb. It is
at this point that God gives the nations the promise of future deliver-
ance. All the crucified saviors the world over were born about the
25th. of December. In those temperate latitudes where snow and ice
are unknown, winter is the rainy season, and the people have their
232 TH£ LJCHT Ot: l:CYP'T
bow of promise in the heavens that God will not entirely dcstro)' the
world with water.
From the time of the win1er solstice the days increase in length,
in the northern hemisphere; tlhe sluggish life forces of matter begin
to expand; and all things increa.<e in vitality until the 21st. of June;
when Sol enters the sign Canco>r. This is the highest [>Oint of declina·
tion north of the equator. It i.s also the highest point of intensity (in
the northern hemisphere) of the cosmic life forces. For a time, these
fo,·ces remain stationary; then reaction slowly sets in; the trees begin
to change their tints, fruits begin to ripen, and the days grow shorter
as the Life Wave recedes.
If a ''Omplete census of the whole population or the northern
hemisphere could be taken, and the actual duration of life, of the
people ascertained, we should find a startling contrast between those
born from Oe<lembcr to June, and those born between July and the
end of November. \\'e should find that those who live the longest
were born in March, April and May, that is to say, a ,·cry great
majority would be found to have their natal day in these months.
While on the contrary, a majodt:y ot the short·lived populahon would
be found to be born during the months of August, September and
October. This is only true on g;cneral principle§, and docs not apply to
any one individual horoscope; in fact, the remarks in reference to the
four triplicities will also apply here. The increase and decrease of the
solor light simply governs the vitalizing capacity of the race, and not
the individual. Rem~rnbcr thois.
Before concluding this gc:neral outline of the psychological prin·
ciples upon which the true ast~ro·masonic science is founded, we must
draw the reader's nuention to its alchemical aspect, nnd point out the
relation astrology bears to this m)•stical sdcnce of the ancient chemists.
Alchemy is generally suP190sed to mean the net o£ trans£onning
the base metal into gold, and as such, it has found more devotees for
the prospective wealth which it appeared to offer, than for the spir·
itunl truth it might contain. But like everything else eonnectl'd with
the Occult, "none can obtain the good unless he merits it," and those
who obtain the control of any force by evil means must pay a fearful
price for it in this world, and a terrible penalty in the ne•t. There-
fore, those who do not study tile s.1cred art for its own sake, in search
of knowledge, will find nothing but disappointment.
ALCHEMY, THE ST..ms AND MAN 233
The seven planets represent the seven metals of the ancients.
Thus, Saturn is symbolized by lead; Jupiter by tin; Mars by iron; Sol
by gold; Venus by copper; Mercury by mercury; and the Moon (Earth)
by silver. In this alchemical arrangement we must note the position
assignd to the solar orb. It is at least significant.
Saturn, lead
Jupiter, tin
Mars, iron
The Sun,
Gold
Venus, copper
Mercury,n1ercury
Moon, silver
The precious metal, then, contains the potencies or principles of
the other six, consequently, each one of the metals, above enumerated,
contains some essential principle that the alchemist requires in the
transmuting process; for gold cannot be produced unless the elements
of which it is composed are present. Not only must they be present,
but they must be mixed in their exact proportion, and then subjected
to the purifying resolvent influence of the universal solvent of Na-
ture, "the water of Pythia." This water, we need scarcely add, is the
astral light; hence it is, that, each one must make the philosopher's
stone for himself; it cannot be bought for dollars and cents; nor mo-
nopolized by syndicates, corporations or improvement (?) companies.
Some individuals are, from their peculiar organization and tempera-
ment, endowed with the power of generating and using the magical
forces of the astral light with little or no exertion upon their part, and
could, if they only possessed the knowledge, produce phenomenal
effects with more ease in three months of training, than others, less
magically constituted, could in a lifetime. In fact, there is the same
predisposition required to make the successful Occultist as there is
in any of the arts and sciences. There is much error in circulation
upon this point that requires sweeping away with the brush of truth,
especially in regard to Alchemy, which many view in the light of mere
chemical formula for gold making. To illustrate this, let us take the art
known as music; one person is born who possesses a natural genius
for harmony, not only so, but he also has the fine, sensitive touch
and mechanical skill to produce harmony; this latter is equally as im-
portant as the former. Another is born possessing a natural love for
music, but that is all. Now, as long as he lives he will have a great
love for musis;:, and be delighted to listen to it, but will never be able
to produce the music himself, because he is totally incapable of mas-
tering the details and mechanical fingering, that is so requisite in the
234
skillful musician. Probabl)' the reader is or has been acquainted with
many such individuals. It is the same with Occultism. The former
represents the natural born magician, the latter the average lover and
student of occult science. Tl~ fom>cr can obtain his knowledge di-
rect from the great storehouse of Nature, the latter only from a long
study of the writings of othef'l. But, there is also a third class to be
considered in viewing the r:tnks of the occult, viz., those who occupy
a midway plane between the two above noted. It is for this middle
class alone that this work wa! prepared.
The celebrated alchemist, Paracelsus, speaking of the astrological
aspects of his science. says in Paragranum I, "lf I have manna in my
constitution 1 can attract manna from heaven. Melissa is not only in
the garden, but also in the air and in heaven. Saturn is not only in
the sky, but also deep in the ocean and earth. What is Venus, but tl•e
Artemisia that grows in your garden, and what is iron but the planet
Mars;" that is to say, Venus and Artemisia are both products of the
same essence, while Mars and iron are manifestations of the same
cause. "What is the human body but a constellation ( microcosm) of
the same powers that formed the stars in the sky? He who knows
Mars knows the qualities of iron, and he who knows what iron is,
knows tl>e attrihutes of Mars. What would become of your heart if
there were no sun in the uni"'ersc? \·Vhat would be the use of your
"vasa spermatica" ( latent astral germs of <ubjective life forms ) if there
were no Venus? To grasp the invisible clements, to attract them b)'
their material correspondences, to control, purify and transmute them
by the ever moving powers of the living spirit, this is true alchemy."
The student will not fail to understand the tme nature of al·
chemical science when he compares the above extract from Paracelsus
with the previous teachings gi·1cn in this and other chapters. The man
who is dominated by the Martial element and knows it, and then
devotes his commercial energies to tl•e realms of Mars, by trading
and speculating solely in iron and its products; the Saturnine individ-
ual controlled by the earthly trigon. who consciously invests his
money, time and abilities in coal mining and trading in lime, clay,
bricks and stone: these men, I say, arc a long way ahead of those
who devote their time and their money to studying and experiment-
ing with the musty old formulas of "Sandivogius," so far as the tnte al-
chemy of Nature is concerned, because they have obeyed the com-
ALCHEMY, THE STARS AND MAN 235
mands of true science upon the .physical plane. They are using the
spiritual and magnetic affinities implanted by Mother Nature within
them, to successfully attract to them, their natural correspondences
on earth; and then, by the aid of commerce, transforming such base
products into the shining yellow gold. Salt, sulphur, mercury and
azoth, exist in the human body as well as in the bowels of the earth
(the one implies the other), and so does the coveted elixir which re-
solves all things into their original elements and confers perpetual
youth. "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
The symbolical diagram at the beginning of this chapter ex-
presses, hieroglyphically, all that the science of alchemy can teach. •
The twelve signs of the zodiac are divided into their various triplicities,
and it will be noticed that each trigon has three planes of manifestation
shown by the three wards of the stellar key. These elements are again
shown, represented by their chemical equivalents, Carbon, Nitrogen,
Oxygen, and Hydrogen; and lastly, the various quadrants represent
the realms of elemental life, which live and move and have their
being within the four great astral triplicities of the old Chaldean
Astrology.

CHAPTER VI
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS
The poet Manilius, so celebrated in the days of Augustus Caesar,
in setting forth the astrology of the Romans gives the following beau-
tiful description of the twelve signs and constellations;
"1\'ow constellations, Muse, and signs rehearse;
In order let them sparkle in thy verse;
First Aries, glorious in his golden wool,
Looks back, and wonders at the mighty Bull,
·whose hind parts first appear, 'he bending lies,
With threatening head, and calls the Twins to rise;
They clasp for fear, and mutually embrace,
And next the Twins with an unsteady pace
Bright Cancer rolls; then Leo shakes his mane
And following Virgo calms his rage again.
Then day and night are weighed in Libra's scales,
Equal awhile, at last the night prevails;
And longer grown the heavier scale inclines,
And draws bright Scorpio from the winter signs.
Him Centaur follows with an aiming eye,
His bow full drawn and ready to let fly;
Next narrow horns, the twisted Caper shows,
And from Aquarius' urn a flood o'er flows.
Near their lov'd waves cold Pisces takes their seat,
With Aries join, ~nd make the round complete."
Centaur, the constellation of Jupiter, i.e. Sagittarius.
:-.iarrow-horns, the twisted Caper, refers to Capricorn, the goat.
Everything in Nature, though constituting a trinity in itself, pos-
sesses a fourfold application when viewed from the external plane.
At least we find this fourfoldness a truth so far as "the things of Earth"
are concerned, and therefore, by the laws of correspondences, the
same application must hold good in regard to the celestial objects in
the heavens. The Hermetic rule is very precise upon this point, viz,
"As on the earth, so in the sky." Therefore, we will describe the four-
fold aspect of the stars as fully as the limits of the present work will
allow. Before attempting this, however, it is perhaps necessary to
remind the general reader, that it is well known to students of Oc-
cult literature, that behind the external personalities of the twelve
sons of Jacob were concealed the various powers of the twelve con-
stellations of the Zodiac. Until quite recently, their correct tabula-
tion has been carefully concealed. In fact, the Kabbalistical and eso-
teric aspect of the science, what Paracelsus calls the "spiritual astrol-
ogy," has never yet been committed to writing, except under the dense
ntE UCifT OF ECYPT
veil of extremely vague allegorical symbols; because this knowledge
formed a portion of "the greater mysteries," 3nd as such, was neces-
sarily ~-onfined to the exceptionally favored few. It must in justice be
added; that, these favored few thoroughly me~ited all the knowledge
they obtained. Time, however, which regulates all things, very har·
monjous1y, arranges the snpp1y of spirih1n1 truth in cxnct pL·oportion
to the real demand. So that a real, earnest demand having arisen for
light upon tl1e spiritual side of Nature, we begin to sec the bright rays
of truth springing up upon the mental hori7.on of the western race.
n.e recipients of Occult knowledge. who have been so long waiting
in \'Rrious quarters lor the tiancs to become ripe. nrc now distributing
their hoarded treasures, with delighted hands, to the dnil~· increasing
number of seekers after truth.
Probably the nearest approach to this spiritual astrology of
Pamcelsus that has yet been Issued from the press, is the remarkable
work by H. Melville, entitled "Vcritas. A Hevclation of the My>tcries",
published in London, England.
For tl1e sake of convenience, we shall divide the study of the
Jllanets and conSiellatioos of the Zodiac into four separate parts, to
be designated as Symbolic:tl, Kabbalistical, Intellectual, and Ph)'Sical.
These four planes are entirely separate from e.1ch other, and must not
be ~-onfouncled in the student's mind. The Symbolical aspect applies to
their purely mystical significance; nnd the various forms and aspects
which they assume in the ingenious imaginations of our early ances-
tors: who, after viewing the forms and forces of Nature as manifested
upon e:\rlh, were ever seeking to find their spiritunl <
:orrCS)>ondence
"in the sky."
The Kabbalistical aspect npplics to their more recondite nature,
and to the various occult forces in Nature to which they ga,·e a
celestial expression. In this important aspect lies concealed, also. the
grand mysteries of the Jewish Temple, the arcane science of the ";se
King Solomon; and last but not least, the Theosophy of later Judaism,
the external fonn of which is now known as Christianity.
The Intellectual aspect applies solely to the mental plane of
humanity, and has reference to the intellectual calibre of the mind.
There is often a radical difTcrcncc between the physical and intel-
lectual natures of the same organism, therefore, the student must he
careful not to confound these two aspects of the Man.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 239
The Physical aspect applies only to the gross external plane, the
passional and material side of humanity. It shows us the intellectual
human animal, as it were, and therefore, is only applicable to those
who are living wholly upon that particular plane.
ARIES ( 'Y' ) THE RAM
The sign Aries, in its Symbolical aspect, represents the Sacrifice.
The flocks and herds bring forth their young during the portion of the
year that the sun occupies this sign. In addition to the sacrifice, the
Ram also symbolizes the spring and the commencement of a New
Year, when life, light and love, are to be bestowed upon the sons of
earth in consequence of the sun having once more gained the victory
over the realms of winter and death. The symbol of the slain Lamb
upon the equinoctial cross, is another type of Aries.
Kabbalistically, the sign Aries represents the head and brains of
the grand man of the cosmos. It is the acting, thinking principle in
Nature called, sometimes, instinct, and again intelligence. Upon the
esoteric planisphere, this sign is occupied by Benjamin, of whom
Jacob, in his blessing to the twelve sons, says "Benjamin shall rave as
a wolf, in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night divide
the spoils." Above all other animals, the wolf is sacred to the planet
Mars, and the sign Aries is under the special and peculiar control of
this fiery planet. Mars is the most fiery of all the planets, and Aries is
the first constellation of the fiery triplicity. The correspondence is
significant. The Hebrews concealed this reference to the planetary
nature of Mars by combining the wolf and the ram. "The wolf in sheep's
clothing" reveals to us the evil action of Mars when malefically
posited in his own sign, the Ram. The Kabbalistical gem of this
sign is the amethyst, and those born with Aries rising upon the
ascendant of their horoscope, possess in this stone a powerful magnetic
talisman. Aries is the first and highest emanation of the fiery triplicity,
and is the constellation of the planet Mars.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Aries signifies the martial spirit of
destructiveness and aggression. It rules the head; "Out of his mouth
went a two edged sword." It is the active will under the guidance of
the executive forces of the brain; and those dominated by this influx
are imperious, dauntless, and energetic, in the first degree. They will
never really submit to the·control of others.
240 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
Upon the Physical Plane, Aries produces a spare but strong body,
of medium height, long face, and bushy eye brows, rather long neck,
powerful chest, complexion rather swarthy; disposition courageous,
ambitious, intrepid, and despotic; the temper is fiery and passionate.
Generally speaking, this sign gives a very quarrelsome, irritable, pug-
nacious person. His diseases are those of the head, small pox, measles
and fevers. Of plants, this sign governs broom, holly, thistle, dock,
fern, garlic, hemp, mustard, nettles, onions, poppies, radish, rhubarb
and peppers. Of stones, Aries rules firestone, brimstone, ochre and all
common red stones.
TAURUS ( b ) THE BULL
The sign Taurus, in its Symbolical aspect, represents the powers of
fecundity, and also the procreative forces in all departments of Nature.
Its genius was symbolized as Aphrodite, who was generally repre-
sented as wearing the two horns upon her head in imitiation of the
Bull. Many mythologists have been deceived by this symbol, and
have taken it to represent a figure of the crescent moon upon the
head of Isis, whereas, it was the planet Venus which the ancients in-
tended to symbolize, because she rules the constellation of the Bull by
her sympathetic forces. Apis, the sacred Bull of the Egyptians, is an-
other conception of Taurus. And as the sun passed through this sign
during their plowing month, we also find this sign used as the sym-
bol of husbandry.
Kabbalistically, this sign Taurus represents the ears, neck and
throat of the grand old man of the skies, hence, this sign is the silent,
patient, listening principle of humanity; also, it is the governor of the
lymphatic system of the organism. Taurus, on the esoteric plani-
sphere, is occupied by Issachar, which means hireling or servant. The
patriarch, in his paternal blessing to Issachar, refers to the obedient,
laborious nature of this sign, as follows: "Issachar is a strong ass,
crouching down between two burdens." This is pre-eminently the
earthly Taurine nature, as the ass and the ox are equally remarkable
for their endurance as beasts of burden. The Kabbalistical gem of
this sign is the agate, and therefore, this stone constitutes a natural
talisman for those born with Taurus on their ascendant. Taurus is the
highest emanation of the earthly trigon, and is the constellation of the
planet Venus.
THE NATURE AKD INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 241
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Taurus signifies the quickening,
germinating powers of silent thought and represents that which is
pleasant and good, consequently, those dominated by this influx are
able to choose and assimilate that which is good. They are slow to
form opinions, are careful, plodding and self-reliant, and patiently
await the realization of results. The chief mental characteristics are
industry and application.
Upon the Physical Plane, Taurus gives a middle stature with
strong, well-knit body, and short, thick, bull-like neck, broad fore-
head and dark hair, a dull complexion and rather large mouth. In
disposition, the natives of the earthly trigon are sullen and reserved.
They make firm friends, and unrelenting foes. Slow to anger, they
are, like the bull, violent and furious when aroused. Of plants, this
sign rules beets, plantain, colts-foot, columbine, daisies, dandelions,
gourels, myrtle, flax, larkspur, lilies, moss and spinach. Of stones,
Taurus governs white coral, alabaster, and all common white st.ones
that are opaque.
GEMINI ( )( ) THE TWINS
The sign Gemini, in its Symbolical aspect, symbolizes unity, and
the strength of united action, also the truths of matehood. The two
bright stars, Castor and Pollux, represent the twin souls. The Greek
myth of Castor and Pollux avenging the rape of Helen, is only a repe-
tition of the biblical story of Simeon and Levi slaughtering the men
of Shechem for the outrage committed upon their sister Dinah by the
son of Hamor.
Kabbalistically, the sign Gemini represents the hands and arms
of the grand man of the universe, and therefore, expresses the
projecting and executive forces of humanity in all mechanical depart-
ments. Upon the esoteric planisphere, the sign is occupied by Simeon
and Levi. "They are brethren," says Jacob, "and instruments of
cruelty are in their habitations,"-which refers in a very unmistakable
manner to the fearfully potent powers of projection that lie concealed
within the magnetic constitution of all those who are dominated bv
this sign. The mystical symbol of the twins conceals the doctrine ~f
soul-mates and other important truths connected therewith. The
mystical gem of this sign is the beryl, which means crystal, and con-
sequently forms the talismanic stone for those born under the in-
fluence of this potential sign. Gemini is the first and highest emana-
Tilt: ..J(,U1 Ot
' ECYPT
tion of the airy trigon, and is tl1e cousteUatioo of the planet Mercury.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Gemini signifies the union of reason
with intuition, and those dominated by its iuJ!ux express tile highest
mental state of embodied humanity. They are volatile, free, philosoph-
ical and generous. Their magnetic spheres• are specially suscep·
tiblc to the influence of inspirational currents. By nature they are
restless and exceedtngl)' encr&clfc. Tln::y possCS.) aJl excess of mental
force which impels them headlong into tl•e most gigantic enterprises.
Their chief charactcristi06 are intuitional and mental activity, conse·
qucntly, they are nervous and restless.
Upon the Physical Plane, Gemini gives a tall, straight body, a
sanguine complexion, dark hair, hazel or grey eyes, sharp sight and a
quick, active walk. They po>sess a restless but gentlemanly appear·
ance. In disposition, the natives of the airy trigon are volatile and
fickle. They arc scicnti6c and possess a great passion for nil kinds of
knowledge; are inconstant, 1md rarely study one subject very long;
nrc speculative, and [>OSsess large imaginations. Of plants, this sign
rules privet, dog-grass, meadow-sweet, madder, woodbine, tansy,
''ervain and yarrow. Of stones, Gemini governs the garnet and all
striped stones.
CANCUI (!;; ) ntE QWI
The sign Cancer symbolizes tenacity to life. The crab, in order
to move forward, is compelled to walk bacl·wa.rds; which illustrates
tJ1e sun's apparent motion. ,vflcn ln this sign, where it commences to
move backwards toward the equator again. It also represents the
fmitCul, sustaining essence of the life forces, hence, we see the sym·
bot of the crab occupying a prominent position upon the breast of the
statue of ISIS, the universal mother and sustainer of all.
Kabbalistically. the sii,'Tl Cancer signifies the vital organs of the
grand man of the starry heavens, and therefore, represents the
breathing and digestive functions of the human family, and also indi·
cates the magnetic control of this coostellation over the spiritual,
ethereal and vital essences, and the capacity of those specially dom·
inated by this nature to receive and assimilate the inspirational cur·
rents. Hence, Cancer governs the powers of inspiration and respira·
lion of the grand man. The sign Cancer, upon the esoteric plnnisphere,
is occupied b)' Zebulon, of whom his patriarchal father declares,
"Zebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea, and he shall be for an
Til~ NAT\.'1\E .'\XI) I:SI· LVV.NCE OF THE 'fWF..LVE SICNS 213
haven of ships," nstrulugicnll)' 1inlimating the home of the crab, which
is upon the sen shore. It also expresses the varied powers of cohesion,
and the par.adoxicnl truths found in all contradictories. The mystical
gem of the sign is the emerald. The stone constitllles a powerful talis-
man for all natives of Cancer, which is the highest emanation of the
watery trigon, and is the con>tellation of the Moon.
Upon the Intellectual Plano, Cancer signWes the equilibrium of
spiritual and material life forces. Those dominated by its influx ex-
press the highest form of the reHcctive powers; they are timid and
retiring: are truly passive. and constitute natural mediums. Cancer
possesses but little of the intuitional qualities. That which appears to
be intuition is direct inspiration. To the cxtemal eye, the natives of
the w•1 tery trigon np)>car to b·e s1othful; whcl'ens, they arc incessant
workers upon the higher or mental plane. This sign expresses to us
the conservation of for=. lis chief attributes are sensitiveness and
reflection.
Upon the Physical Plane, Cancer gi\'CS a medium stature, the
upr>er part larger than the lowt:r, a small, round face, pale or delicate
complexio•\, h•·own hair anJ !tlnull, t.x:nsivc gre:y eyes; disposition ef-
feminate. timid and thoughtful: temper mild; conversation agreeable
and pleasant. Of plants, thi< <ign rules cucumbers. squashes, mciOI>S,
and all ,.,.·ntcr \'Cp;etation such a~ rushes, wntcr lilies, etc. Of stones,
Cancer govern< chalk, seleuit~. and all solt, white stones.
U:O ( .!t ) THE LION
The sign Leo symboli1cs strength, courage nnd Are. The hottest
portion of the year, in the no•·thern hemisphere, is when tho sun is
passing through this sign. It i:< the solar Lion of the mysteries that
ripens, with its own internal heat, the fruits brought forth from the
earth by the moishne of Isis.
Kabbalistically, the sign l.oo signiJles the heart of the grand
man, and represents the life center of the Ouidic cirC\•latory system of
humanity. It is also the fire vortex of physical life. Hence, those born
under this inOux nrc noted fo•
· the superior strength of their physical
constitution; nnd also for their wonderful recuperative powers after
being e.•haustcd by sickness. Th(• sign Leo upon the esoteric plani·
sphere, is occupied b)• Judah. of whom his dying parent says, "Judah
is a lion's whelp, from the prey my son thou art gone up. He stooped
down. he couched (l.S a. lion." This sign rcvenls to us the mysterie~
244 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
of the ancient sacrifice, and the laws of compensation. The mystical
gem of Leo is the ruby, and it forms a most potent disease-resisting
talisman for all governed by the Leonine influx. Leo is the second
emanation of the fiery triplicity, and is the constellation of the sun.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Leo signifies the sympathies of the
heart. Those dominated by its influx are generous even to excess with
their friends. By nature they are deeply sympathetic, and possess that
peculiar grade of magnetic force which enables them to arouse into
action the latent sympathies in others. As orators their earnest, im-
pulsive, pathetic style makes them an irresistible success. An ex-
ceedingly fine specimen of Leonine oratory is given in Genesis, 44th.
ch. This simple, eloquent appeal of Judah to Joseph, probal::ily, stands
unequaled, for its sublime tenderness. The natives of Leo are im-
pulsive and passionate, honest and faithful. Their mental forces are
ever striving to attain unto some higher state; hence, their ideas are
always in excess of their means to accomplish their large, majestic
and grand plans.
Upon the Physical Plane, Leo gives a large, fair, stature, broad
shoulders, large, prominent eyes, oval face, ruddy complexion and
light hair, generally golden. This is for the first twenty degrees of the
sign. The last ten degrees give the same but a much smaller person.
Disposition high spirited, resolute, haughty, and ambitious. Of plants,
this sign rules anise, camomile, cowslip, daffodil, dill, eglantine, eye-
bright, fennel, St. John's wort, lavender, yellow lily, poppy, marigold,
garden mint, mistletoe, parsley and pimpernel. Of stones, Leo gov-
erns the hyacinth and chrysolite, and all soft yellow minerals such as
ochre.
VIRGO ( TlJ2 ) THE VIRGIN
The sign Virgo symbolizes chastity, and forms the central idea of
a great number of myths. The Sun-God is always born at midnight,
on the 25th. of December, at which time the constellation of Virgo is
seen shining above the horizon in the east. Hence, originated the
primitive idea of the Son of God, being born of a Virgin. When the
sun passes through this sign the harvest is ready for the reaper; hence,
Virgo is symbolized as the gleaning maid with two ears of wheat in
her hand.
Kabbalistically, the sign Virgo signifies the solar plexus of the
grand archetypal man, and therefore, represents the assimilating and
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 245
distributing functions of the human organism. Consequently, we find
that those born under this influence possess fine discriminating powers
as to the choice of food best adapted to their particular organic re-
quirements. This constellation, as governing the bowels of humanity,
is highly important, since the intestines comprise a very vital section
of the digestive organism and vital fluids. Upon the esoteric plani-
sphere, Virgo is occupied by Asher. "Out of Asher, his bread shall be
fat," says Jacob, "and he shall yield royal dainties." Thus typifying
the riches of the harvest. This sign expresses the fulfillment of the
creative design, hence, the mysteries of maternity are concealed under
this symbol. It also reveals to us the significance of the sacrament of
the Lord's Supper. The mystical gem of Virgo is the jasper, a stone
possessing very important virtues. It should be worn by all natives
born under this sign. Virgo is the second emanation of the earthly
trigon, and is the constellation of Mercury.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, the sign Virgo signifies the realiza-
tion of hopes. Those dominated by this influx are calm, confident and
contented; they are reflective and studious, and extremely fond of
reading. Consequently, they become the mental repositories of much
external wisdom and learning. Their chief attributes are hope and
contentment. These desirable qualities, combined with the mental
penetration of Mercury, which this sign contains, all con<iuce to make
the native of Virgo pre-eminently fitted for the close application of
scientific study. They possess large, well balanced brains and very
superior intellectual abilities and make clever statesmen, when thrown
into the vortex of political life.
Upon the Physical Plane, Virgo gives a medium stature, very
neat and compact, dark sanguine complexion, and dark hair; disposi-
tion is ingenious, studious and inclined to be witty; rather even tem-
per, but more excitable than Taurine persons. As orators, Virgo persons
are fluent, plain, practical and very interesting. Of plants, this sign
rules endive, millet, privet, succory, wood-bine, skullcap, valerain,
wheat, barley, oats and rye. Of stones, the various kinds of flint.
LIBRA ( :!!: ) THE BALANCE
This constellation, in its Symbolical aspect, typifies justice. Most
of our readers doubtless have seen the goddess of justice represented
as a female, blind-folded, holding in her hand a pair of scales. This
conception is purely astrological, and refers to the celestial Libra of
246 THE U CFM" OF ECYPT
the heavens. The sun enters this sign about the 21st. of September,
when, as the poet Mnnilius says:
"0 4\y and night lti"C weighed in Llbr,'\'.s ~t:~1le).,
Equal ;t,\\ hile. ~: l:.s:t the night prC\"ails.''
Kabbalistically, the sign Libra signifies the reins and loins of the
grand celestial man, and therefore, represents the central conservatory
or store house of the re-productive fluids. It is nlso the magnetic vorte.x
of pro-creative strength. This constellation also represents, in its most
interior aspect, the e<ruinoctial point of the nrc in the ascending and
descending cycle of the life atom. Therefore, this sign contains the
unification of the cosmic fore<s as tlle grand central point of equilib-
rium of the sphere. Libra upon the esoteric planispherc, is occupied
by Dan. The patriarch, in his blessing, thus refers to his celestial
nature; "Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of lsrucl."
Libra represents the interior equilibrium of Nature's forces, and con-
tains the m)•stery of the divine at-one-ment of the ancient initiations.
Upon the universal chart, this sign becomes Enoch, the perfect man.
Its Jn)•Stical gem is the cliamcnd. As a magnetic talisman, this stone
net$ as a repulsive force, and combines with the magnc11c sphere of
those horn under its innuence, to repel the emanations from foreign
bodies, either of persons or tt.ings. Libra is the second emanation of
the airy triplicity, and is the constellation of Venus.
Upon the intellectual Plane, Libra signiAes external perception,
balanced by intuition, the union of which becomes e.xtcmalized as
reason and foresight. Therefore, those dominate<! by this inRuence
.constitute the rntionnllstic school of the wol'id's body of thinkers.
Theoretically, they are strong supporters of such conceptions as uni-
venal brotherhood, universal equality and the rights of man. But
practically, they seldom (unless it pays) reduce their pet theories to
nctutol practice. The nntives of Libra, though possessing a finelr bal·
anced mental and magnetic organism, arc seldom elevated into very
prominent positions. This is because they are too even, both mentally
and physically, to become the popular leaders of an)• radical or sen-
sational party. It is one of tho attributes of Libra, to infuse a natlll'nl
instinct within all horn under her infiuence to accept and adopt the
golden mean, or, as it has been termed, "the happy medium.· Hence,
they generally commnnd r"'l'cct from both sides on questions of
debate.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 247
Upon the Physical Plane, Libra generally produces, when rising
at birth, a tall, slender form, of perfect proportions, brown hair, blue
sparkling eyes, and a fine clear·complexion. The disposition is noble,
amiable, high-minded and good. It is perhaps as well to note the
fact that this sign often produces dark brown and black hair, and in
females, very handsome features. Of plants, this sign rules watercress,
white rose, strawberry, primrose, vines, violet, heartsease, balm, lemon-
thyme and pansy. Of stones, Libra governs white marble, spar and
all white quartz.
SCORPIO ( TT1. ) THE SCORPION
The sign Scorpio, in its symbolical aspect, symbolizes death and
deceit. It is the allegorical serpent of matter mentioned in Genesis as
tempting Eve. Hence, the so-called fall of man from Libra, the point
of equilibrium, to degradation and death by the deceit of Scorpio.
No wonder the primitive mind, when elaborating this symbol, tried
to express a spirit of retaliation; as Mackey says, in speaking of these
ancient races,
"And as an act of vengeance on your part,
You placed within the sun a scorpion's heart."
thus alluding to the brilliant star Antares.
Kabbalistically, the sign Scorpio typifies the generative organs of
the grand man, and consequently, represents the sexual or pro-creative
system of humanity. It is the emblem of generation and life; there-
fore, the natives of Scorpio excel in the fruitfulness of the seminal
fluids, and this creates a corresponding increase of desire. A distinct
reference to the fruitfulness of this sign will be found in Genesis,
chap. xxx, wherein Leah, when she beheld the birth of Zilpah's son, ex-
claimed, "a troop cometh." (see verses 10 and 11) Scorpio, upon the es-
oteric planisphere, is occuped by Gad, of whom the dying Jacob says,
"Gad, a troop shall overcome him, but, he shall overcome at the last;" in-
timating the fall of man from a state of innocence and purity, through
the multitude of sensual delights, and his final victory over the
realms of matter as a spiriual entity. This sign represents the physical
plane of the attributes of pro-creation. It contains the mystery of sex,
and the secrets of the ancient phallic rites. The mystical gem of
Scorpio is the topaz, the natural talisman of those born under this
influence. Scorpio is the second emanation of the watery trigon, and
is the constellation of Mars.
248 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
Upon the Intellectual Plane, the sign Scorpio signifies the gen-
eration of ideas; hence, those dominated by this influx possess an in-
exhaustible resource of ideas and suggestions. Their active evolution-
ary minds are ever busy with some new conception, and their brains
are literally crammed full of inventive imageries. They possess keen
perception, fine intuitional powers, and a very positive will. Hence,
they excel as medical practitioners, chemists and surgeons. In the
various departments of the surgical art, natives of this sign possess no
equal. In addition to this mechanical ability, they are endowed with
a powerful, fruitful, magnetic life force which they sympathetically
transmit to their patients. This is why they become such successful
physicians. The sexual desire is naturally very strong, hence, they are
liable to excess in this direction.
Upon the Physical Plane, this sign gives a strong and rather cor-
pulent body, medium stature, dark or ruddy complexion, dark hair,
features often resembling the eagle; disposition active, resentful, proud,
reserved, thoughtful and also selfish. Of plants, this sign rules black-
thorn, charlock, heather, horehound, bean, bramble, leek, woad and
wormwood. Of stones, lode stone, blood stone and vermillion.
SAGITTARIUS ( jll ) THE ARCHER
This constellation, in its Symbolical aspect, represents a dual na-
ture, as it symbolizes retribution and also the hunting sports. We find
it depicted as a Centaur, with the bow and arrow drawn to its head
ready for shooting. Hence, it was frequently used to designate the
autumnal sports, the chase, etc. The Centaur was also a symbol of ·
authority and worldly wisdom. Mackey, speaking of this sign, said,
"The starry Centaur still bends the bow
To show his sense of what you did below."
Kabbalistically, the sign Sagittarius signifies the thighs of the
grand universal man. It, therefore, represents the muscular founda-
tion of the seat of locomotion in humanity. It is the emblem of stability,
foundation and physical power. This sign also represents the centers
of physical, external, authority and command. Sagittarius, upon the
esoteric planisphere, is occupied by Joseph. "His bow abode in
strength," says the patriarch, "and the arms of his hands were made
strong." It also represents the powers of "Church and State," and the
necessity of legalized codes, civil, military and religious. It indicates to
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 249
us the organizing powers of humanity, and the absolute necessity of "the
powers that be" in certain states of development. \Ve see in Joseph,
the Egyptian ruler and law-giver, a true type of real authority. The
mystical gem of this influx is the carbuncle, which is a talisman of
great virtue to its proper natives. Sagittarius is the lowest emanation
of the fiery trigon and is the constellation of Jove, the planet Jupiter.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Sagittarius represents the organizing
power of the mind; hence, this influence indicates the external powers
of command, discipline and obedience, to the ruling authority of ma-
terial institutions. Persons of this nature are loyal, patriotic, and law
abiding. Such natives are generous and free; energetic and com-
bative; hasty in temperament; ambitious of position and power; also
charitable to the afflicted and oppressed. They possess strong con-
servative qualities; and their chief mental characteristics are prompt
decision, self control, and the ability to command others.
Upon the Physical Plane, this sign usually produces a well formed
person, rather above medium height, sanguine complexion, oval face,
high forehead, bright brown hair, fine clear eyes; in short, handsome.
In disposition, the native is quick, energetic, fond of out door sports
and recreations; hasty tempered, jovial, free and benevolent. Of
plants, this sign rules agrimony, wood betony, feather-few and mal-
lows. Of stones, Sagittarius governs the turquois, and all the stones
mixed with red and green.
CAPRICORN ( 11J) THE GOAT
This sign, in its Symbolical aspect, typifies sin. The scapegoat of
the Israelites; and the universal offering of a kid or young goat as an
atoning sacrifice for sin, are significant. The different qualities of the
sheep and the goat, from a symbolical standpoint, are used by St.
John in his mystical Apocalypse. The Redeemer of mankind, or Sun
God, is always born at midnight directly Sol enters this sign, which
is the winter solstice, "The young child" is born in the stable and laid
in the manger of the goat, in order that he may conquer the remain-
ing signs of winter or death, and thus save mankind from destruction.
Kabbalistically, the sign Capricorn signifies the knees of the
grand macrocosm and represents the first principle in the trinity of
locomotion, viz., the joints; bending, pliable and movable.. It is the
emblem of material servitude and as such is worthy of notice. Capri-.
11-tt! UCIIl 0}-' t:G\'P'I'
corn, upon the esoteric planhphere, is occupied by Naphtoli, whem
jacob says, "is a hind let loo>e. he giveth goodly words." Here we
have two very distinct references; the first, to the symbol, a hind or
young deer, i.e., a goat with horns, (goats and deer are equally sig-
ni6cnnt of the earthly, mountainous nature, and are fond of high
hills); the second, is the Christmas proclamation, he giveth goodly
words, "Peace on earth, good will toward man." This sign represents
"regeneration; or re-birth, and reveals the necessity of "new dispen-
sations." TI1e mystical gem cf this constellation is the onyx, some-
times called "chalc<ldony." C.•pricorn is the lowest emanation of the
earthly trigon, and is the constellation of the planet Saturn.
Upon the Intellectual Plane. Capricorn signifies external form,
and those dominated by its in8ux arc among the very lowest in the
scnlc of true spirituality. The brnin of this influence is ever on the
nlert to seize and take advnntago of circumstances. The sign gives a
flurcly scheming mentality; the intellectual nature is directed purely
to the attainment of scl6sh ends: tlte penetrating power of tl1e mind is
great. The natives are quick as lightning to see in others the weak
points that they may work to their own advantage. TI1ey are indis-
posed to do any real hard work unless they sec some great benefit
therefrom in the immediate future. It is :1 very undcsirnble in8uence.
Upon the Physical Pl:tnc, Capricorn generally gives a medium
stature, slender, often ill proportioned; plain looking, energetic in
their own interests, and indol<nt in tl1e employ of others. Frequently
these natives have a long sharp chin and slender nose, with small
piercing eyes. They are altnos: always narrow chested. In disposition,
thC)' are crafty, subtle, reserved and often melancholy. At the same
tim~. natives of Saturn arc often miserly. Of plants, this sign rules
hemlock. henbane, deadly ni&htshaclc and black poppy. Of stones,
Capricorn governs coal and all black or ash colored minerals.
AQUARIUS(:) Tit£ WATEII-8F..AREJI
This sign symboli1.es judgn1cnt. This constellation forms the starry
original of the urn of Minos, from which flow wrath and condemna-
tion or blessings :tnd rcwnrd, according to the works done in the
hody, irrespective of theological faith. The earlier baptismal urns of
the primitive Christians. and the elaborate stone fonts of the later
churches, arc relics of this great astral religion.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 251
Kabbalistically, the sign Aquarius signifies the legs of the grand
archetypal man, and therefore, represents the locomotive functions of
the human organism. It is the natural emblem of the changeable,
movable and migratory forces of the body. The Water-bearer, upon
the esoteric planisphere, is occupied by Reuben. "The excellency of
dignity and the excellency of power," says Jacob, "unstable as water
thou shalt not excel." A simple but magnificent astrological descrip-
tion of this sign, which, from time immemorial, has been symbolized
by two wavy lines (.tZ'), like the ripples of running water. This sign
signifies consecration, and not only contains the rites and mysteries of
consecration~.,but will reveal to the student the potency of all sacred and
dedicated works. The mystical gem of this sign is the sky blue sapphire
(not the dark or opaque sapphire). Aquarius is the lowest emanation of
the airy trigon, and the constellation of Uranus.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Aquarius represents popular science,
and consequently, the truth of material phenomena. Those domi-
nated by its influx constitute the school of inductive philosophy; the
grand basis of all exoteric science. They represent the intellectual and
scientific spirit of their age and generation; and cannot advance one
step beyond those classes of facts which are demonstrable to the
senses. Elegant in form, they are brilliant in intellect.
Upon the Physical Plane, Aquarius gives a medium stature,
plump, well-set and robust; good, clear, sanguine complexion; sandy
or dark flaxen hair; very prepossessing appearance; disposition ele-
gant, amiable, good natured, witty and very artistic; fond of refined
society. Of plants, this sign rules spikenard, frankincense and myrrh.
Of stones, Aquarius governs black pearl and obsidian.
Pisces ( *)the Fishes
This sign symbolizes the Hood; chiefly because, when Sol passes
through this sign the rainy season commences; clearing away the
snows of winter, the melting torrents of which Hood the valleys and
lowlands. This sign is also the terminus of Apollo's journey through
the twelve signs.
"Near their loved waves cold Pisces keep their seat,
With Aries join, and make the round complete."
Kabbalistically, the sign Pisces signifies the feet of the grand
cosmic man; and therefore, represents the basis or foundation of all
252 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
external things as well as the mechanical forces of humanity. It is
the natural emblem of patient servitude and obedience. This sign,
upon the esoteric planisphere is occupied by Ephraim and Manasseh,
the two sons of Joseph, who received their portion in Israel as the
two feet of the grand, archetypal man. It signifies confirmation, also
baptism by water. It also indicates to us the divine purpose of the
great cycle of necessity; commencing with the disruptive, flashing,
dominating fire of Aries, and terminating with its polar opposite,
water, the symbol of universal equilibrium. The mystical gem of
Pisces is the chrysolite (white and glittering). Pisces is the last
emanation of the watery trigon, and is the constellation of Neptune.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Pisces represents m~ntal indiffer-
ence. It is the polar opposite of the head. Those dominated by its
influx express a peculiar indifference to those things which generally
interest others. They take all things as they come, and pay no serious
attention to any. They live and die in accordance with St. Paul's ad-
vice, being "all things to all men."
Upon the Physical Plane, this sign gives a short, fleshy body,
brown hair, pale complexion, moist, watery eyes (fishy looking); dis-
position negative, timid, listless and harmless. Their nature is peace-
able, but their actions are influenced by their surroundings and
friends. Of plants, this sign rules all sea weeds, also ferns and mosses
that grow in water. Of stones, it governs coral, rock, pumice and
gravel or sand.
THE OCCULT APPLICATION OF THE TWELVE SIGNS
The four triplicities symbolize the four cardinal points of the
universe. To us, on our present external and physical plane, they
signify the four opposite points of space as represented in the compass
and cross (hence the sacredness of the cross as a symbol in all times
and ages) and the four Occult elements, Fire, Earth, Air and Water.
They each correspond to a particular quarter of the heavens. Thus,
the Fiery Trigon corresponds to the positive-azoth; and is expressed
in the glowing, flaming, eastern horizon at sunrise; the beginning of
the day. Similarly, primary molten fire was the beginning, or first
condition, of the present order of things on our globe; and stands
for that principle of heat termed caloric, which sustains the animal,
vital life force of all animate beings upon the face of the planets.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE 'IWELVE SIGNS 253
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Fire represents zeal, animal cour-
age, daring; and in fact, all that pertains to action and activity. While
on the higher (esoteric) .plane, Fire implies the interior apprehension
of the meaning and significance of action as displayed in the trinity,
and expressed by fire of three terms as Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius;
Aries ( 'Y' ) the intellect; Leo (61.., ) the emotions; Sagittarius ( if! ) the
offspring of the intellect and emotions; the external result or consum-
mation of the two; that point which is neither the one nor the other;
but where the two are one.
The Earthly Triplicity stands for the frozen, inert north, as a
symbol of frigidness, hardening, crystallizatioq, death. It is con-
cerned with all phenomena that is most externaf and palpable to the
external senses; the solids, metals, fabrics. ·
Upon the Intellectual Plane, it is concerned with the relations of
solids to each other, from which is especially evolved form, propor-
tion, sound, etc. The same may be said of the metals dug up from
the bowels of the earth, of the commerce, arts and industries resulting
therefrom. Esoterically, the earthy trigon denotflls the comprehension
of the spiritual qualities evolved from the earthy activities; or,
rather, that one spiritual quality of three-fold formation expressed
in three mystical terms; Taurus ( ~ ), servitude or spirit of patient
work; Virgo (~), formation and re-formation; Capricorn (VJ), the
result of the union of Taurus and Virgo, which leads either to the
higher plane in the spiral of existence; or to th~· lower plane on the
downw:;trd course to darker realms of being; m'ore earthy, hardened
and dead.
The Airy Triplicity represents the west; the scene of the setting
sun; which signifies the dying of the day, of sense and of matter;
which is only the promise of another day; an advance to a higher
plane. This brighter day is denoted by the airy trigon; and is con-
cerned, upon the external plane, with the priestly, political and social
relations of human life. That is to say, it represents the higher qual-
ities of these relations. It is, therefore, symbolized by the invisible
element, air; the great medium of motion. Its fsoteric significance is
comprised in the arcana of the one true scien~. After first having a
knowledge of the twins ( )( Gemini) external: the internal science
attains unto the adjustment and equilibrium or balance (::= Libra) of
the two; so that they exactly blend in the divine equipoise of harmony
254 THE UCIIT Ot' t:GYI:rr
and wisdom; thus realizing only the rippling waves (.::: Aquarius) of
peaceful results; instead of the downpouring 8oods and cataclysms;
both social and physical; which otherwise result from the unbalanced
scales (,... Libra); when extemal and internal antagonize, as two
hostile and absolutely separate and dual forces; instead of balancing
as two modes of one and the same eternal motion, the one life of the
universe.
The Watery Triplicity, symbolical of the solllh, is the exact op·
positc of the earthy north. It is the frozen, melted; the hardened,
liqucfled; the renewal of the crystal into other forms; and the rcsur·
rcclion of death into life. The watery trigon signifies the constant
effort in Nature to adjust opposites and contradictories; to bring
about chemical changes and affinities as especially seen in fluids; and
as so perfectly symbolized in that great distinguishing feature of
water, viz., to seek its own level. On the external plane of human life,
the watery trigon denotes love ( oo ):sex ( 11\. Srorpio and if Mars);
and offspring ( *); the external results of the union of the two
( love and sex). On the more esoteric planes, Cancer (!<;) symbolizes
tenacity to life, hence, the desire for immortality; which, combined
with a knowledge of the mysteries of sex ( 11\. Scorpio and 4 ~·Iars) or
generation ond regeneration, leads the immortal soul to the termination
of its earthly pilgrimage and material incarnations, in the union with
its missing half or Pisces (*). which is symboliZ<.'<I, upon the celestial
equator (equilibrium ), as the two fishes bound together by the cord
(of love). Having regained this equator and passed from the lower
nrc of rnnttcr, the soul enters once more upon tho spiritual path of
eternal conscious life.
Tho reader will now perceive that the four great trigons are but
the diJl'erent series of attributes within the human soul or microcosm;
and further, that the twelve constellations of the zodiac reveal the
mystical signification of Adam Kadmon, the archetypal man of the
starry planisphere. Thus; Aries ( '1' ) rules the head, brain and the
6ery will; Taurus ( lS ) the neck and throat, the ears, the listening
requisites of obedient servitude; Gemini (X ) the hamls and arms,
or projective and executive powers; Cancer ( $) the breast, bosom
aod lungs, which signify life and love; Leo (S\.) the heart and its
varied emotions: Virgo ( t1J1) the bowels, the navel or maternal, the
compassionate and formulative qualities; Libra (....) the loins or physi·
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS 255
cal strength, the power of balancing the mental faculties; Scorpio (1T\. )
the generative organs and the procreative attributes; Sagittarius ( ;r. )
the hips and thighs, the seat or foundation of volitional force, the
migratory instincts; Capricorn (v.5') the knees, tokens of humble sub-
mission to the higher powers; Aquarius (::::-) the legs and ankles or
active powers of movement and locomotion; and lastly, Pisces ( *)
the feet, the foundation of the whole frame, which should ever be
capable of finding and sustaining its own level unaided, lest the grand
human temple fall to the ground. Thus we begin with fire and ter-
minate with water. These constitute the two poles of the human
magnet.
NoTE: To obtain the celestial application of the above, the points must be reversed;
north becomes south; east becomes west, and so on.

CHAPTER VII
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE PLANETS
Before describing the nature and influence of the planets as
known to the initiates of Hermetic Philosophy, it is necessary to point
out to the reader the difference between the nature of a planet and
a constellation. The twelve signs constitute the innate, latent possi-
bilities of the organism, and as such represent the constitution as a
whole. In this light we have considered them in the previous chap-
ter. While on the other hand, the planets constitute the active forces
which arouse these latent possibilities. In this duplex action of sign
and planet, both natures come into play and produce the various
results of external life. Man, the microcosm, is merely the sounding
board, so to say, the re-acting point for their ethereal and magnetic
vibrations. Further, while the twelve signs represent the human or-
ganism as a form containing latent possibilities; the sun, moon, and
planets, represent the spirit, soul, and senses, of that organism. Man
consists of body, soul, and spirit, as described in Section II, Chap. II.
As at present manifested, he has five physical senses as stated in Sec-
tion III, Chap. IV. The constellations are the body; the Moon is the
soul; the Sun is the spirit; and the five planets; Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
Venus, and Mercury, represent and express the five physical senses. It
is in this light that the reader must consider the various natures of the
planetary influx, described in this and the succeeding chapters. A
great many students of the mystical science fall into serious error
through failing to grasp this relation of the stars and the planets.
It must also be borne in mind, that; when considering the actual
influences at work in a given horoscope; those signs only which con-
tain one or more planets will be the dominant forces within the con-
stitution; mental, physical, or both; according to the plane occupied
by the person. To ascertain the particular plane a person occupies, is
a very difficult matter with most students. It can only be gauged and
understood by those who possess the interior senses of the soul in
such an advanced state as to be capable of spiritual perception, either
of sight or feeling. Therefore, the perfect astrologer is the perfect
man. There are, however, many degrees of perfection; and the reader,
258 11i.E: LlCHt OF ECYM'
as well as the writer, must feel thankful for the degree which he may
already possess; and set to work in real earnest to attain a still greater
degree of spiritual perfection.
Ttlf: SUN 0
The symbolical aspect of the glorious orb of day, undoubtedly,
first occupied the attention, veneration, and worship, of the primitive
races of mankind. Every thing in Nature depends absolutely upon
the presence, and kindly support of the shining sun, for its existence
and life. The literal interpretation of the Hebrew name for the sun,
Ashahed, is "the all bountiful fire;" which is perfectly in harmony with
the solar orb.
It is utterly impossible, in the brief space at our command, to give
even the remotest cor
1ccption of the innumerable ramifications con-
nected with the various mythologies which typify the sun. We will,
therefore, only add that Osiris of Egypt, Chrishna of India, Belus of
Chaldea, and Ormazd of Persia, are merely different personifications
of the sun.
Kabbalistically, the Sun represents the central splrltual source of
all. It is the divine Ego of the grand man, and therefore, signifies the
spiritual potentialities of creative power. It is the great I AM of all
things; both spiritual and temporal; and is, in itself, the grand con-
servatory of Life, Light and Love. Upon the esoteric planisphere, the
Sun becomes the great archangel Michael, who defeats Satan and
tramples upon the head of the serpent of matter; and thenceforward,
guards the way of life and immortality, with the flaming swords of
solar power. In this sense the sun represents the positive, aggressive,
conttolling forces of the cosmos, as the forces of the sun are electtic.
Asttologically considered, the Sun constitutes the central life prin·
ciple of all physical things. His infiux determines the absolute measure
of physical vitality within each human organism. When the solar
ray is not vitiated by the discordant configurations of malefic stars, the
individual then born, will enjoy a sound constitution; more especially
so, if the sun at the moment of birth is between the ascendant and
meridian; or, in other words, durir'lg the increase of the diurnal sun-
shine, which is from sunrise to noon.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, the Sun governs the higher group of
the selfish sentiments and lower group of the moral qualities; the for-
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 259
mer, represented by firmness and self esteem; and the latter, by hope
and conscientiousness. Those dominated by this influx are the natural
born leaders of mankind. By their high-minded presence, they pro-
claim their "right divine to govern." They are proud and ambitious,
yet magnanimous and noble. Hating all mean, petty and sordid ac-
tions, they express the very highest form of true dignified manhood.
Upon the Physical Plane, the position of the sun in the horoscope
is one of vital importance; for on this, in a male natus, hangs the vital
thread of life. If evil rays concentrate thereon; the life will be of
short duration; unless counteracting aspects intervene.
When the sun is afflicted at birth, his influence upon the native
through life, will be malefic. When this is so; even minor evil direc-
tions to the sun and moon combined, will bring about destruction of
life; the nature of which will be similar to that of the afHicting planets.
And note this: for prosperity and success in life; it is essential that
the luminaries be well aspected and favorably situated in the celestial
figure. When the sun and moon are afflicted at birth, depend upon it,
that person will have a very hard struggle against an adverse fate all
the days of his life; and it will not require the powers of an inspired
prophet to foretell his general destiny. "From evil, discord and suf-
fering are born."
The Sun, rising at birth, confers courage, pride, ambition, and to
a certain extent, good fortune. But, if afflicted by Saturn, the native
will suffer much in health, and be correspondingly unfortunate. If
afflicted by Mars, the native will be cruel, rash and quarrelsome. Such
a one will have little respect for the feelings of others; unless Jupiter
or Venus cast beneficent rays. Generally speaking, the Sun when ris-
ing at birth gives a person of strong frame, good forehead, large eyes,
sharp sight, tawny or brown hair. If well aspected and dignified, the
disposition is noble, generous, and proud, yet humane, and courteous;
a truly faithful friend and generous foe. He is profuse in his manner,
and loves magnificence. If evilly aspected and ill dignified; then the
native is mean, proud and tyrannical to those under his authority, but
a submissive sycophant to his superiors; shallow minded and thor-
oughly unfeeling.
THEMOON)
The symbolical aspect of Luna, like that of the Sun, cannot be
detailed. From time immemorial the fair goddess of night has been
260 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
venerated and worshiped as the universal mother; the feminine fructi-
fying principle of all things. In the poetical conception of the He-
brews, the moon was called Ash-nem or Shenim, the state of slumber
and change. Without a complete knowledge of astrological science,
the weird truths concealed beneath the veil of Isis, can never be
properly und,erstood. Astrology alone, is the true key to the funda-
mental principles of Occultism. The secret of the tides; the mysteries
of gestation; and the alternate periods of sterility and fruitfulness,
caused by the ebb and flow of the magnetic life currents throughout
every department of Nature; are discoverable only by a comprehen-
sion of the divine goddess of our midnight skies. This knowledge was
the sublime attainment of the sages, "who," says Bulwer Lytton, "first
discovered the starry truths that shone upon the great shemaia of the
Chaldean lore." Chandra of the Hindoos; Isis of the Egyptians; Diana
of the Greeks; and others, are all, the moon.
Kabbalistically, the Moon represents the soul of the grand man.
It is, therefore, the celestial virgin of the world, in its mystical appli-
cation; the emblem of the Anima Mundi. Upon the esoteric plani-
sphere, Luna becomes transformed into the Angel Gabriel. Upon the
universal chart, we see her expressed as the divine Isis, the woman
clothed with the sun. As Isis, she represents the grand initiatrix of the
soul into the sublime mysteries of the spirit. The Moon, also, repre-
sents the moulding, formative attributes of the astral light. She, also,
stands as the representative of matter. Hence, in her dual character,
she reveals to us her forces which are purely magnetic; and as such,
they stand as the polar opposite of those of the Sun, which are electric.
In their relation to each other, they are woman and man.
Astrologically considered, volumes might be written regarding this
orb. When we consider her proximity to our earth, and her affinity
with it, as well as the rapidity of her motion, we cannot help grant-
ing to her the highest position, as an active agent in every branch of
judicial astrology. Her influence is purely negative, however; and in
herself alone, or when void of the configurations of the Sun and
planets; she is neither fortunate nor unfortunate. But, when con-
figurated with other orbs; her influx becomes exceedingly potent as
she receives and transmits to us the intensified influence of those stars
aspecting her. The Moon, therefore, may be called the great astro-
logical medium of the skies.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 261
Upon 'the Intellectual Plane, Luna governs the physical senses,
and to a great extent the animal passions also. She controls the lower
forms of the domestic qualities, and the lower group of intellectual
faculties. Those dominated by her influx are changeable in their
nature, submissive and very inoffensive. Magnetically, their odylic
sphere is purely mediumistic; hence, they become inactive and dreamy.
Generally, Luna natives may be said to be rather indifferent characters,
lacking anything and everything that may be called strong and decisive.
They are given to roaming about, or constantly moving their residence
from one place to another.
Upon the Physical Plane, the influence of the Moon is convertible
in its nature, being harmonious or discordant according to her relative
position to the sun and major planets. If the moon be dignified at birth;
she renders the native more refined, engaging, and courteous, than he
otherwise would be. Should she also be well aspected; such a posi-
tion will confer refined, artistic tastes, easy disposition, and good
abilities. On the contrary, should the moon be ill dignified or
evilly aspected, the native then born will be a shallow-minded, evil
character, prone to dissipation, slothful, and void of proper business
foresight, consequently, improvident. If the horoscope be a strong one
in other respects, and points out sterling ability; then these aspects
will tend rather towards making the person diplomatic. These aspects
are also a strong indication, when unassisted by benevolent rays, of
ultimate insanity. Very great consideration is necessary upon these
conflicting points. In addition to the indifferent disposition above
mentioned; the Moon, when rising, usually produces a medium-sized
body, fair or pale complexion, round face and grey eyes; the forehead
wide but not high; temperament phlegmatic.
THE PLANET MERCURY l;l
In its symbolical aspect, the planet Mercury was most prominent
as "the messenger of the gods." A thousand myths have been
elaborated regarding "the fleet-footed Mercury." In the fertile imagina-
tions of the early Greeks, the spirit of Mercury was ever on the alert
to manifest its powers. His actions though sometimes mischievous,
were often beneficial. It seems that the central idea of these ancients
was to typify or express in external form the restless activities of the
mercurial mind; hence, wings were placed upon his head and feet.
TilE tJC11T Ot· t:CY'PT
Kabbalistically, the planet Mercury signifies perception, and
therefore, represents the power of sight within the gi"'nd body of the
celestial man. It is the active power of self-consciousness within hu-
mnnity, and the ability to see, perceive and reason. Upon the esoteric
1
1hmispherc, Mercury becomes transformed i~to the angelic Haphacl,
the genius of wisdom and nrt. We see, therefore, that the esoteric
forces of this orb are those which tend to elevate mankind from the
animal planes to those of tl>c human.
Astrologically considered, the in8ux of ~lercury is mental and
rc>tless. No system of mere human io,·ention would have dedicated
to an almost invisible star; the least and most insignificant of all primary
11lanets; the govemment of man's inteUectual nature. Any fanciful
system would have attributed such <tO important group of mental
qualities to the Sun, or to the lordly Jupiter. The experience of the
ancients, however, showed them that, neither the Sun nor Jupiter
possessed any such influence; and it is upon the experience of ages,
that the b-uths of astrology arc founded; and the rules made for their
application.

phrase. "get up and get;· for energy, intellect, and impudence, consti-
tute tlu~ chief eharacterislics of the purely Mercurial native. There is
nothing too hot or too heavy for his ingenuity; nor is there anything
too great for his fertile brnin to accomplish. The United States, as a
whole, are ruled by Gemini, the constellation of Mercury, and the
restless energy, commercial enterprise, and scheming abilities, of the
tyrical American are well exrrcssed by the singular influence of his
patron star.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, however, the planet Mercury is
tntly the gctliu.s of wistlom, nntl governs the whole of those ment'.ll
qualities denominated pcrceplive. The oratorical JlCwers are likewise
ruled by this planet. Those dominated by its in8ux arc ingenious.

THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 263
will give an unwearying fancy and strongly incline the mind towards
the curious and Occult side of Nature. Should Mercury be ill dignified
and void of the good aspects of other orbs, and at the same time be
affiicted by Mars; he will produce a liar. and an unprincipled, shuffling
nature, incapable of attaining or appreciating the higher mental and
moral standards. If strong or well aspected, and below the horizon,
he inclines the native to mystical and Occult studies; but if above the
horizon and dignified, he confers a more external influence and pro-
duces orators, statesmen and teachers. One of the chief attributes of
this planet, when well placed above the horizon, is that of literary
ability. All such natives possess genuine talent in this direction. It
may, therefore, be safely said that Mercury confers the ideal when
below, and the practical when above, the ascendant at birth. Physically,
Mercury gives a medium stature, strong but slender frame, exceed-
ingly active, sharp piercing eyes, thin lips, well cut features and confi-
dent look. The complexion depends upon the Race.
THE PLANET VENUS ~
In her mythological and symbolical aspect, the planet Venus
has been venerated, the wide world over, in her dual character of
Love and Wisdom. The bright star of the morning, proud Lucifer,
was the harbinger and genius of wisdom; and truly, none of the stars
of heaven can compare with the brilliance and glory of Venus when
she shines as the herald of day. As the goddess of Love she is equally
prominent. The ancient Greeks also represented her as Aphrodite,
wearing the horns of her sacred Bull, Taurus.
Kabbalistically, the planet Venus signifies the Love element within
the soul, of the grand archetypal man; and therefore, represents the
sense of feeling within embodied humanity. It consequently expresses
the clinging, yielding, feminine portion of the human constitution.
Upon the esoteric planisphere, Venus becomes the celestial Anael,
prince of the astral light. In this character we behold her powers of
transformation, and the "conservation of forces." As Isis represents
the astral fluid in a state of rest, pregnant (by the Holy Ghost) with the
things TO BE, Anael represents the same fluid in action. Therefore,
the Moon and Venus form the kabbalistic symbols for the two modes
of motion within the soul of the universe.
Astrologically considered, the planet Venus may be said to repre-
264 'I'J-[1~ I.LCU'r 01•' HC\' P'l'
sent mirth, joy, and conviviality, as the influx inclines those w>
der her
rule to pleasure-seeking, and grand display. The pleasures of society
are especially governed by Venus. Balls, parties, concerts, and recep-
tions, possess aJmost irresistible attraction to those born under her
infiucncc. Jf afOictcd in a fcmi1lioc horoscope, ,Vithout strong counter-
acting rays, the native becomes "unfortunate'' and suffers from the loss
of virtue, hence the position of Venus is very important.
Upon tllC Intellectual Plane, Venus controls the higher group of
the domestic qualities, and also the idea!, artistic, and musical, senti-
ments. Those dominated by her influx <.'xccl in rnusic, art, and poetry.
and become noted for their refined accomplishments. But, at the same
time, they lack true moral p<~ver. They '\re guided impulsi\•cly by
their sentiments. passions, and desires. Reason is conspicuous by it.s
absence when their desires are aroused. Hence, the danger of being
nlislcd by Hattery ;;uld scntilnent.nl nonsense is very great. when Venns
is not protected by harmonious rays.
Upon the Physical Plane, when Venus has chief dominion over
the mind of the native: she induces a slrong predilection for society,
and inclir1cs to dancit~og. music. dnlwi11g, etc. She also confers a good
humored, witty, kind and charitable disposition. Men domin~tcd by
this ioBux are always great favorites with the fair sex; but they are
thoroughly deficient in firmness and self-control; and, if ill digniJled,
th~ male native will often find himself h\ awkward affairs; and is
liahl<... to fall into intemperance. A friendly aspect of S~turn in such
case~ would do much toward.s cooling a.nd steadying the native's
character and inducing reflection. \Vomen born with Venus in the
ascendant generally display the most amiable, engaging and fascinating
qualities. 1£ well a.spected. they are neat and artistic in their dress
and personal appearance; elegant in their homes and generally as
virtuous as they arc bcautifcd. It has been truly said, "The general
disposition derived from Venus is that of mildness a nd genuine good
nature; and whatever defects may fall to the lot of the native, they
are seldom great ones; and are more the results of weakness and a
strong animal nature, than constitutional wickedness or a desire to do
wrong." In this we fully concur, and will only add that the chan~'Cs
to do wrong arc multiplied by a prepossessing e.,tcmalism. They arc of
medium stahue, of fair clear complexion, bright sparkling wicked
eyes, handsome features and beautiful form.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 265
THE PLANET MARS ~
This planet, of all others, in its symbolical aspect, was the object
of divine honors in the eyes of the ancient world. Mars seems to have
been the most sincerely worshiped, of all the gods, by our northern
ancestors. The greatest glory, in their rude times, was enjoyed by the
greatest warrior. Hence Mars, in his universal character, represented
the god of war. He was also symbolized as Vulcan, the celestial
blacksmith, who forged the thunderbolts of Jove. This indicates the
rule of M~rs over iron, steel, fire, and edged tools.
Kabba).istically, the planet Mars signifies alimentiveness within
the gfand1 man, and therefore, represents the sense of taste in the
human constitution. We have a direct reference to the expression of
these martial forces in reference to the physical sensations in the New
Testament, viz.: "eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow we die."
Upon the esoteric planisphere, Mars becomes transformed into the
angel Samael (Zamael), wherein are shown the highest attributes of
this spirit. As such, it represents the power and ability to appreciate
the higher, finer, and more ethereal essences of the life wave, and
therefore, to have dominion over the powers of absorption and
assimilation.
Astrologically considered, Mars typifies and embodies, in his astral
expression, the spirit of cruelty, bloodshed, and of indiscriminate
destruction. The true son of Mars is a genuine pugilist of the first
water, and is never so happy as when thoroughly engaged in van-
quishiHg his opponent. A type of this questionable spirit of enterprise
may be found in the history of Great Britain. England is ruled by
the sign Aries, the chief sign of Mars, and the typical Englishman is
a Mars man. No better subject for study can be found to illustrate
Mars, than John Bull. He is always fighting some one, and his past
history for a thousand years upon land and sea, is the record of
brilliant victories with very, very few reverses.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Mars represents the spirit of enter-
prise, energy, and courage. Without a spice of this orb all men would
be shiftless, effeminate cowards. Those dominated by the Martial
influx are mechanical in the highest degree; and possess an uncon-
querable, untiring, energy, and potent will.
Upon the Physical Plane, Mars signifies all those who are in any
way engaged in the production of iron and steel. All Martial men
266 TU£ LIC::trT OF &CYPT
prefer some business where sharp instruments, iron or lire arc used,
as in the case of butchers, barbers, blacksmiths, etc. When the planet
is rising at birth, it always imparts a certain kind of ruddiness, either
upon the face or hair, a fiery look, and gives to the native n dauntless,
manly, appearance. If located in the second angle, it causes the native
to become improvident and to spend money thoughtlessly. Such a
person never be<."Omes wealthy, but always lives up his means. Located
in the 10th. house or mid-heavtn, it never fails to cause the nntive much
suffering from slander and consequent detriment of character. When
we compare the native of Ma:s with that of Saturn, we lind them as
polar opposites. The latter is like a slow, lingering consumptive disease,
and the former like a roging fever. 1\o matter who or what they may
be, depend upon it, you will always lind the native of Mars fiery,
headstrong, furious in temper, and in respects cruel and destructive;
nnd yet withal, they aro generous to excess with their friends, nnd fond
of good company. The general description of a true Mars man is
somewhat as follows; medium height, strong, well made body, ruddy
complexion, piercing eyes, sq~arc set jaw, bold determined look, and
quick, quarrelsome temper. The color of the hair is variable, but it
has generally a fiery tinge.
TliE PLAJ<ET JUPITER 2!
Under its symbolical aspect, we lind Jupiter universally recognized
among the ancient Creeks as jove, the celestial fatller of all. Under
the remoter Aryan symbolism, we find it represented as the "All father
of Heaven." Both conceptions, C,·eck and Aryan, are identical. In
the rude conceptions of the hardy sons of the north, we sec the planet
Jupiter depicted as Thor, from which comes the saxon Thors-day and
the modern English Thursday, the day over which the planet was
supposed to rule.
Kabbalistically, the plant! jupiter signifies ethereal absorption
within the grand man. It th: reforc, represents the power of scent
or smell within the body of humanity. It is the sense by means of
which the developed soul perceives and partakes the liner aromatic
essences of 1\ature. Upon the esoteric planisphere, Jupiter becomes
transformed into the celestial Zachnriel or Zadkicl, and thus rcpre·
scots the impartial spirit of cUsinterestedness. In this capacity, it
signiAes the principles and philosophy of arbitration; the perfect
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 267
adjustment of equilibrium by the withdrawal of disturbing forces. As
symbolical of the attributes of ethereal absorption, we are frequently
reminded of this planet by the Kabbalistical writers, of the books of
Moses, who intimate that "a sweet smelling savor" was acceptable to
the Lord during the sacred rites of the temple service.
Astrologically considered, the planet Jupiter is the largest, and
next to Saturn the most potent planet in our solar system. He signifies
all that is truly good and charitable in human life. His action is truly
noble, far removed from the sheepish timidity of Saturn, or the im-
pudent forwardness of Mars. The genuine son of Jupiter fills the
atmosphere around him with genial warmth. His soul is brimming
full of honest good nature. Utterly incapable of practicing fraud him-
self, he never suspects it in others; hence, often becomes the victim
of others' schemes and duplicity. This planet's nature suggests itself,
when we say that, he takes every man to be honest until he is proven
to be a rogue; and when this is proved, will forgive him once or twice
before punishing him.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Jupiter signifies the higher moral
nature, the humanitarian qualities, and is the author of all noble and
charitable institutions and enterprises. Those dominated by his influx
express the highest form of human nature. There is something truly
royal in this planet's influence, a mixture of the father, patriarch, and
king. Such natives do much to redeem mankind from their general
depravity. There will always be found in the natives of Jupiter, upon
the intellectual plane, a fine sense of discrimination; hence, they pos-
sess rare qualities of justice, which entitle them to be judges of the
people. When they err, it is always on the side of mercy.
Upon the Physical Plane, Jupiter may be called the greater fortune,
when he rules over a nativity. He gives a sober, manly, commanding
presence. The native is sober and grave in his speech, but, at the
same time kind and sympathetic. If well dignified, he makes the
native sincere, honest, and faithful; generous, liberal, prudent, and
aspiring; strongly given to religion and moral sentiments; and generally
speaking, all that can be desired, where morality, integrity, and faithful
service is required. Located in the 2nd. house, and well aspected, he
brings great wealth to the native. Dignified in the lOth. house, he
confers the highest honor upon the native. Such persons always attain
unto very important and responsible positions, which they fill with
268 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
dignity to themselves, and honor to those who promote them. This
planet's position, unaffiicted in the 7th. house, confers great matri-
monial felicity; in the 11th. house, faithful and powerful friends; in the
5th. house, great gain and benefit through his offspring. But, when
Jupiter is affiicted and ill dignified, then his nature is greatly altered.
The native is generally a pretender to all these noble qualities. He
externally simulates them, but at heart, he is a shallow, scheming hypo-
crite, a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is the judge who renders his
opinion according to the price. He is hollow, a fraud and a sham.
The Jupiter man is generally a tall, well made, rather fleshy, generous
looking, dignified person, sanguine complexion and brown hair.
THE PLANET SATURN J?
Old Father Time, with his skeleton-like form and deathly scythe,
is doubtless, well known to most of our readers. This is one of the
many forms assumed by Saturn in his symbolical aspect. With the
ancient Greeks he was known as Kronos, holding the cycle of neces-
sity and eternity in one hand, and the symbol of death in the other;
thus typifying eternal change of form, sphere, and function. Among
the ancient Hebrews, Saturn was called Shebo, a name that literally
means seven. It is composed of Ash-sheb, which means the star of
old age; thus expressing the symbol of this planet.
Kabbalistically, the planet Saturn signifies silent meditation, and
thus corresponds to the auricular attributes of the grand man; and
therefore, represents the senses and powers of hearing, listening, etc.,
within the constitution of humanity. We see, therefore, the mystical
significance of the Kabbalistical conception of this orb, as silent medi-
tation. In order to meditate, there must be silence; hence listening,
hearing. Meditation is but the listening of the mind to the inspirations
of the soul. Upon the esoteric planisphere, Saturn becomes the angel
Cassiel, the genius of reflection in the astral light. It also presents
to us the occult side of all theological mysteries; hence, the medieval
conception of this planet as the isolated hermit. It is in this sense,
that, we find it symbolized in the Tarot; a system worthy of greater
attention than seems to be paid to it by modern students of occult
science.
Astrologically considered, the planet Saturn may be truthfully
said to be the most potent and malignant of all the planets. This is
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 269
not so much on account of the marked character of his influence, as
the imperceptible, subtle manner, in which his influx undermines the
vitality of the physical organism of those it afHicts. Mars comes like
a thunderclap, and gives every one to understand that there is some-
thing decidedly wrong. But Saturn is exactly the reverse. His nature
is slow and patient, cunning and stealthy. At least, a good half of
our world's suffering is due to the action of this planet; and in fact,
nine-tenths of the ills of human life are due to the malignant rays of
Mars and Saturn combined. Mars commits crime in a passionate
and unthinking manner, and very seldom indeed is guilty of premedi-
tated wrong. Saturn is the reverse. He thinks over all his plans very
carefully before he attempts to put them into execution, and seldom
makes a mistake.
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Saturn governs the higher group of
the selfish sentiments, and the whole of the reflective qualities. Those
dominated by his influx are retired, reserved, slow in speech and action.
They express the highest form of reflection; consequently, they are
studious, scientific and close reasoners. They generally tend to ex-
clusiveness; hence, the hermit is a true type of this planet's action.
They excel in all Occult studies.
Upon the Physical Plane, the only good that Saturn can do, is to
strengthen the mentality, cool the passions, and make the native selfish
and careful of his especial interests. When a person can claim these
favors, he is exceedingly fortunate; because almost every aspect and
position of this planet is rather more of a misfortune than a blessing.
In nature it is cold and selfish, and is very apt to create a miserly dis-
position. If located in the mid-heaven, it brings ultimate ruin and
disgrace. The horoscopes of Napoleon I and Napoleon III are splendid
examples of this position. Both were born with Saturn in the M. C.
(mid cusp) and both attained to heights of fame, and then suffered
from disgrace, and died in exile. When Saturn is exactly upon the
zenith and afHicting the sun and moon, the child then born will not
live twelve months. If in the ascendant, it makes the person timid
and miserly, and generally produces a weak circulation. If in the 7th.
house, the native may expect a miserable life when he marries. When
in the 5th. house, the children of the native seldom live, unless one of
the horoscopes, especially the wife's, counteracts this. The chief
thing to note is whether the planet is well aspected or dignified. If
270 'lrl.E LICIIT OF ECYPT
such is the case, the native is much superior, and the influence is
ch.iefiy upon the mental plane. The native of Saturn is a thin, spare,
lank-y person; small, sharp eyes and black hair; and inclined to mel-
ancholy.
We have now completed our descriptions of the seven planetary
principles of Occult philosophy, and will now add an outline view of
the two remaining orbs, Uranus and Neptune; both belong to a higher
octave.
TH£ PLA.Nl.'T URANUS Jt(
Uranus, the mythological parent of Saturn, commences the first
series of a higher round or cycle of celestial inOuencc. His nature is
that of Mercury upon a mote interior plane, and that of Mars and
Saturn combined upon the lower or physical plane. As Mercury is the
first of the planets, Uranus is the eighth or octave expression of the first;
consequently, we can only properly obsen•e the real influx of this planet
upon the higher or mental plane. This fact must be carefully noted.
When Uranus is dignified and well aspected at birth, he will act as a
bcncSc, and vice versa. A gteat number of otherwise tolerably good
artists of astral science, make a very serious mistake in taking this
planet solely as a malefic.
Astrologically considered, the planet Uranus has not so far been
able to exert his full power upon the human brain, except in rare in-
stances. The age is not yet ripe for his inRuence. Comparatively few
possess the necessary etherealization of "brain stuff" for this planet to
fully e•-press his action. These few are, almost without exception, to
be found in the ranks of Occult science and spiritualism. The natives
of Uranus are always ahead of their time. They are veritable reformers
upon the plane they occupy in humanity. Their contempt for the
conventionalities by which they find themselves surrounded, always
create.< the active hostility of those who admire the forms, customs.
and opinions of "society.'" Consequently, they have many bitter ene-
mies. They are always persecuted by popular opinion and the
leaders thereof. But, the Ura>ian soul does not care for consequences.
His dauntless, intrepid spirit acts with perfect independence. Under
these circumstances, UrafH.IS :\lways beoomes a disturbing force, amid
shallow, false or purely arti6cial conditions of life. This only adds
further proof. if that were necessary, that tile age is not yet ripe for
the full action of this weird and eccentric orb.
THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE STARS 271
Upon the Intellectual Plane, Uranus rules the ideal sentiments
and the imagination to a very great extent. Those dominated by his
influx possess the most extraordinary abilities in special directions.
They are real geniuses, whose talents are so strange and erratic that
they seldom, if ever, become appreciated. They are inventive,
original, acute observers, possessing large perceptive and executive
powers, but much given to roaming over the face of the earth; in
other words, are Bohemians.
Upon the Physical Plane, Uranus tends to make the native an
object of comment, and those under his influence are odd in their
ways, very eccentric, and stubborn to the last degree. They are
strongly argumentative and opinionated. What they say is to the point,
and asserted with a startling amount of confidence. If well as-
pected and dignified, Uranus produces sudden wealth. Cases of un.
expected wealth, from the poorhouse to the millionaire, are exactly the
style of Uranus. When evilly aspected, etc., then he becomes malefic in
the highest degree, and brings sudden reverses, quite as unexpected
as his gains. Sudden failure, collapse of banks and other com-
mercial squalls, which bring down the rich to the condition of
poverty, are generally due to Uranian influence. When Uranus
affiicts the significator of marriage in the natus, or is located
in the 7th. house, illicit connections are brought about, both before
and after the legal unions. This planet is the great significator of
the Occult, and his influence never fails to produce mystics.
THE PLANET NEPTUNE t,i!
This planet is the most recently discovered of the primary planets,
and constitutes the present "scientific frontier," so to say, of modern
astronomy. But, it is not the last, as there are others still more re-
mote, whose action upon the mental and nervous constitution of man-
kind, at present, is nil. Each orb becomes visible to our earth only
when the planetary life which it evolves is susceptible to the action
and re-action of its influx. But at present the influence of Neptune is
very small, except upon certain organisms; therefore, we are not
prepared for the revolutions of still more ethereal forces. As the race
evolves higher susceptibilities, the influence of Uranus and Neptune
will increase, and that of Mercury and Venus will wane. Neptune ex-
presses all the higher qualities at present known to us.

THE LOST ORB *)
Strange as it may seem, it is, nevertheless, a fact, that there is
a missing planet. It has been allegorically expressed by Jesus as the
prodigal son; by Moses as Abel; and by the prophets of the Scandinav-
ian Edda as "Ragnarok." To our esoteric system there are ten celes-
tial bodies somewhere, viz. the Sun and nine planets. At present we
have only nine in all. Where, then, is the lost one? The exalted adept
alone, can solve this problem. Suffice it to say, that it symbolizes the
missing soul within the human constitution. Pushed out of the line
of march by disturbing forces; this orb became, for a time, the prey
of disruptive action and ultimately lost form; and is now a mass of
fragments. The ring of planetoids, between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter, indicate to us the empty throne of Abel, whom Cain (Mars)
slew in his anger. The time will ultimately come when this orb will
be re-constituted, and Abel will rise up from the dead. Until that
time, the missing soul will seek its physical mate in vain, except in
rare cases. When this day shall arrive, the Utopia of Neptune and
the Millennium of St. John will begin upon earth. May that time
speedily arrive.
Each planetary chain consists of seven active orbs and three
latent ones. When one becomes latent, another becomes active. Re-
member this occult fact. THEY CORRESPOND TO THE TEN
SEPHIROTH OF THE KABBALAH.

CHAPTER VIII
THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS
The next branch of this celestial science which requires our notice,
is the practical application of the various laws, principles and influ-
ences, in their direct relation to man and his material destiny. There-
fore, we will first present a brief outline of the scientific basis, so to
say, upon which the action and inter-action of stellar influences re-
pose, and then offer a few concluding words of general advice.
The magnetic polarity of any given geographical point on our
earth's surface is changing every moment. This continual changing in
the earth is accompanied by a corresponding change in the electric
and more ethereal vital currents of the atmosphere. Both of these
varying conditions are caused, primarily, by the diurnal motion of the
earth upon its axis from west to east, which causes the whole heavens
to transit the visible horizon from east to west during the space of one
natural day, of 24 hours. The secondary causes are the various mo-
tions and aspects of the Sun, Moon and planets, as they .relate to the
positions of the earth in her annual orbit about the Sun. The primary
basis, the diurnal motion of the planet, claims our attention first. We
will, therefore, briefly examine its nature and philosophy.
The real motions of the earth are the only motions that have any
real influence upon the physical organism of the earth's inhabitants.
These motions determine the length of the day, measure out to us the
proportion of light and darkness, regulate the seasons, and fix with
the hand of fate, the exact duration of the year. All these have a
manifest influence upon the organism of man.
As our mother earth revolves upon her axis, the whole of the
celestial heavens seem to rise, culminate and set upon every portion
of her surface. Though this ri~ing and setting is only an appearance,
so far as the heavens are concerned, it is absolutely real to the earth's
inhabitants, because the influences, as they transit the earth from east
to west, are exactly the same as if the earth was the stationary center
of our solar system, and the heavens were revolving around it.
The varying conditions of the astral and magnetic forces are
caused by the various angles, at which, in their apparent motions, the
276
s:teJiar influx is reflected to any given p-oint of the earth. Fol' instance,
the conditions at sunrise al'e practicall)' different from the conditions
prevailing at noon, when the Sun is shining: upon the meridian. At sun~
set we see another wonderful difference manifested, possessing nothing
in common with either noon or sunrise. Then. again, we have the
midnight state of the earth and the atmosphere, in which the t'Ondi·
tions are the polar opposite of those in force at noon. These c-ardinal
points of the day indicate the greatest changes. bllt. as a matter of
course, these changes, from one to thE" otht.~r, nre gradual. To
measure this gradual :mgular change, the ancient a•trologers divided
that space of the heavens visible at a.ny moment into six: houses or
mansions, as they termed them, and the opposite or invisible arc
into the sarne number, making twelve in all, designated as the
diurnal and nocturnal houses of the heavens. Modern astrologers
follow out the same principles, because, being founded upon the
rock of absolute truth, their inAuencc can be verified in every cor~
rectly calculated horoscope, when the plane occupied by the native
is taken into consideration.
These twelve houses contain, loke ll>e signs of the Zodiac,
:30 degrees of space each, hut unlike them, the house distance is
measured by degrees of right ascension, or time, instead of celestial
longitude. This is the only real relation existing between the twelve
houses and the twelve signs. The various symbolical relations
between the two, such as Aries being the regent of the first 1nansion
and so on, possess no inOuencc or importance in the practical appli-
cation of the science, but pertain to the realm of Kabbalistical
mythology.
If the reader will draw a circle three inches in diameter, and
then, in the center of this, a smaller circle about one it'lch in diameter,
he wi11 possess two mathematical ideas in objective C
onn. The
smaller circle will represent the earth, the larger one the heaven
;;\round it. If we now divide the larger circle into qua.dnu"'tS. we
shall see the angles which represent the four cardinal points of
the day, and, upon a more extensive scale, the seasons of the year.
These are no mere fanciful idea<, but they are external symbols
of living realities upon the external plane of phenomena. If the
reader will now divide the larger circle into twelve equal parts,
be will possess another outline chart representing the twelve houses
THE PRACfiCAL APPLICATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS 277
of the heavens, with the earth in the center. The horizontal line
upon the left represents the eastern horizon or the point, in refer-
ence to the earth, which is occupied by the sun at sunrise. The
perpendicular line above the horizon, marking off one quadrant
of the circle, represents the zenith or meridian occupied, at noon,
by the sun in its daily transit. Now between these two points, the
horizon and the meridian, we have two angular lines which divide
the quadrant of 90 degrees into three parts containing 30 degrees
each. These are the three south-eastern houses which mark off
the angular changes of solar and astral influx between sunrise
and noon. The horizontal line opposite to and parallel with the
line of the horizon, shows that point of the heavens which is
occupied by the sun, in reference to the earth, at sunset, and the
two angular lines between it and the meridian indicate the changes
of terrestrial and celestial conditions between noon and sunset.
Thus, in the space of the daytime, the sun, stars and planets (if
there should be any situated in that part of the heavens) have made
the transit of the diurnal arc of six houses. During this time every
conceivable change of polarity that is possible under solar influx
has been manifested upon the earth, and thousand:; of human
beings have been ushered into physical existence, each and all
differing more or less widely from each other, according to the
influence dominant at the exact moment of mortal birth. It is
needless to repeat this description of the six nocturnal houses; it is
similar; the perpendicular line opposite the zenith is the lower
meridian where the sun is situated at midnight; then, still moving
forward in its ceaseless round, the sun arrives upon the horizon
again, at sunrise, to commence another day. In order to give a
clearer idea of this thought than words can possibly convey, we
insert a diagram which explains itself. We have only to add in this
connection, that the earth is divided into positive and negative
halves, which are continually changing from one to the other; the
half under the sun's rays is always positive; that portion under the
shades of evening is negative. Day and night then, like the sun
and moon, are the polar opposites of each other, and so are the
individuals born under the two conditions.
From the foregoing, it will be seen that any number of individuals,
born during the course of a single day, at different times, will differ
278 1'HI! LJCLIT OF ECYPT
widely in their physical temperament and mental bias. :-lot only so,
but, they will differ just as widely in their fortunes and destiny. Herein,
then, we see the grand basic principles of this science; which accounts,
in a most philosophical manner, for the wonderful diversity in human
beings; so that, scarcely any two arc alike in mind, form, or feature;
because no two are born exoctly at the same moment of time, under
exactly tl1e same position ·of the heavens. For instance; suppose one
hundred children in different parts of the world were horn at the
same precise moment of time, tho difference in the latitude and longi-
tude of their respe<:tivc birthplaces would render it probable that no
two would be alike; bec.1use of the difJerent aspects presented by the
heavens to different portions of the globe at exactly the same moment.
The reader has only to bear in mind that, it is sunrise, noon, sunset,
nnd midnight, every moment; at some point on the earth; in order
to reaUze the great natural difference that exists between those who
arc born at the same moment of time in different parts of the world.
The secondary causes "hich regulate and modify tho astral and
planetary influx are the apparent motions of the sun, moon, and
pl::mels, iu theif orbits, a.s they eitllcr approach cnch other or reocdc.
As before stated, it is the real motion of a planet which affects its
inhabitants; therefore, we need not repeat the reasons we have already
given. When our earth is so situated as to appear to an observer in
the sun to be moving thro•gh Cancer; the sun appears, to the in-
habitants on earth, to be pas~ing through the opposite sign, Capricorn;
and so far as the earth is concerned it really is; because the solar
center stands between the earth and the sign; and the solar inOux is,
consequently, impregnated with the magnetic qualities of Capricorn;
with which it permeates the enrth. Hence, when we speak of the
inAucnce of the sun in Capricorn or any other sign, though onJy an
astronomical appearance, we me4n exactly what we say. Further,
when the earth, by its progressive motion, mo,·es faster or slower in
a diJferent direction from other planets and causes them to become
alternately stationary, direct in motion, or retrograde; we know that
these are purely appearances, so far as the planets, themselves, are
concerned; but their influx h just the same on earth, as if it were a
reality; because the real movements of our earth place thorn in those
positions, in reference to tho apparent position of tho suu. The various
angular distances so formed, termed aspects, are so potent in their
TilE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS 279
magnetic effects; that some times, the whole good or evil influx of
a given planet is completely polarized by them; and, almost always,
these aspects are found to constitute very important factors in the
native's horoscope.
The reader will perceive from the foregoing statement of astral
principles, that in order to properly gauge and apply the actual in-
fluences in operation at a person's nativity; two primary considerations
are necessary, viz.: the time and place of a person's physical birth.
Without these, nothing reliable can be scientifically determined. And
any system of astral, planetary, or solar influences; that pretends to
determine the celestial influences upon man; which ignores these
essential elements, is thoroughly inaccurate; if not utterly misleading.
Before concluding these brief remarks upon the basis of this
science, we would point out the fact, for the benefit of some of our
readers; that ancient astrology is not, as so many seem to think, "an
exploded science;" and further, we wish to point out another very
important fact, viz.: that, not a single individual can be found, who
talks or writes of this astrological explosion; who himself, understands
the fundamental principles of the science he is defaming. Many
superficially learned individuals think that the old geocentric system
of Claudius Ptolemy was the only foundation upon which the ancient
astrology rested; and that, when the present Newtonian system over-
turned the Ptolemaic theory of a "primum mobile," the astrology of
the ancients was buried amid the ruins. We need scarcely add that,
such superficial minds are in sad need of a little true light. The ob-
served effects of certain positions of the heavens; be they apparent
or real; is the only foundation of judicial astrology; and it was upon
the continuous observations of ages, that the old Chaldean sages
formulated their wonderful science of the stars. The eclipses of the
Sun and Moon, the conjunctions of the planets, and the exact length
of the solar year, were all correctly computed, ages before the days
of Abraham. In reality, it makes little difference to astrology; whether
the earth moves about the Sun or the ·sun moves about the earth; ·
for it rests upon the absolute fact that, one of them does indeed move.
So far as the physical organism of man is concerned; the planet
which gave it birth is its center and the focus of all celestial influences;
hence, the earth and its motions are the only ones of vital importance
upon the material plane. We would point out to all would-be heio-
280 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
centric astrologers who desire to formulate special "solar" systems
of planetary influence for themselves; that, the whole basis of their
system rests upon a mere question of terms; and is as much an appear-
ance as the geocentric conception. The orbits of the planets, of our
solar system, are so small and insignificant compared with the in-
conceivable distances of the constellations; that to say that a planet
is in any particular sign or constellation; is nothing but asserting, that
which is only an appearance. It is only removing the point of observa-
tion from the earth to the Sun. Both are optical illusions; but, in this
removal, the illusion is intensified. What are the signs of the Zodiac
but apparent lines and apparent spaces? They certainly have nothing
to do with the real constellations of the heavens at the present day.
Nevertheless, their influence is a demonstrated fact. These signs are
nothing more nor less than angular distances in the heavens, which
mark off the increase and decrease of the solar influx, upon the northern
and southern hemisphere of the earth. Surely then, the system which
adopts one series of appearances is very incomplete; that does not
include the whole, embracing a map of the heavens. Away then
forever, with this pseudo-scientific sentimentalism which speaks so
much of realities; when in very truth, it is embracing nothing, but
an aggregation of shadows and appearances.
The various mathematical details, which constitute the external
and purely practical department of the science of exoteric astrology,
can be thoroughly studied out by each interested reader for himself;
from the numerous books published upon the subject. To guide the
student of this science, we will say that "The Dictionary of Astrology,"
by James Wilson, and "The Text Book of Astrology," vol. I, by A. J.
Pearce, are among the very finest works.
Our advice to any one commencing the serious study of The
Science of the Stars, is to carefully read and reread the works just
referred to; then master the mathematical and mechanical details;
thirdly, make yourself familiar with the various aspects, characters,
·etc., of the planets; and lastly, study closely the occult laws and
esoteric principles relating thereto as given in this work. When this
course of study is completed, you may commence experiments by
erecting the horoscopes of yourself and friends; and note how far
the observed results agree with your astrological deductions. If this
advice is followed out, you cannot go very far wrong; for it is upon
THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS 281
the full realization of the occult and philosophical principles under-
lying this external formula, that a real knowledge of astrology consists.
It is this absolute knowledge of the stars, that always distinguishes
the true artist from the astrological pretender, and "fortune telling"
imposter. It is these latter charlatans who, by their unprincipled
methods and villainy, have caused the very name of astrology to
become the synonym of superstition and fraud in the eyes of nine-
teenth century intelligence. So different are the people and the condi-
tions which surround us; from those who lived in the days of old, when
the wise men of Chaldea communed with the beautiful constellations
of heaven; and learned therefrom, the mighty secrets of the soul's
origin and destiny; as well as the material details of their physical
lives. The same book of Nature is open now, as then; but, only the
pure in heart can read its pages and trace the mystical chain of life,
as depicted by Nature through the stars, to Nature's Cod.
THE SOUL AND THE STARS
The beautiful, twinkling, glittering stars,
The rivals in splendor of Venus and Mars,
They come and they go,
Moulding the powers of our weal or our woe.
Shining serene in the heavens above,
Nightly teaching us lessons of love,
No discords nor jars
Appear to disturb these beautiful stars.
The soul seems to claim these jewels on high,
And struggles to soar to its source in the sky.
But sorrow and pain
Are the pathways that carry it homeward again.
How oft have we dreamed, when gazing above,
That the purified soul - the offspring of love,
When freed from earth's load,
Would find in the stars its peaceful abode.
So fondly we think of our homes in the sky,
Joined with the soul for whose presence we sigh;
Where Saturn nor Mars
Can embitter our joys mid the beautiful stars.

:: MYSTICAL CllA,INj OR, 'lliE \Jl\"'ON OF mE SOUL AND TH£ STARS
II$ the soul unfolds in true spiritual light, the manifest unity be-
tween man and his divine source; also between man and the myriad
creations of the inJlnite universe; become " self evident and absolute
fact. Dut, unfortunately, the undeveloped soul sees none of these
great facts of unity and identity; nor perceives tl>c vital relations
existing between the soul and the stars. The facts of tl>e one seem to
him totally irrelevant to the facts of the other; while, on t11e other
hand, to the initiated seer, a true knowledge of the soul is impossible
without a perfect understanding of the stars. Equally, are the stars
incomprehensible, apart from the soul. Man, the microcosm, is, in
himself, a miniatu.re universe; composed of inSnite atoms; which are
in a constant state of action and re-action; not only among themselves;
but also, with the inSrute aton-.s of the larger univene, t11c macrocosm.
Hcnco, a true science of the soul c:~nnot be founded which doe-s not
also include a true science of tbe stars. It also follows; that deductions
based upon a comprehension of these higher relations, which are self
evident to the seer; will appear to the ordinary undeveloped human
being as quite irrational and illogical; since the premises are, to him, in-
congruous and unrelated. With such, all efforts at enlightenment are
quite futile in the present state of evolution; but for those souls strug-
gling to awake to the higher truths of their cxistcnco and destiny; this
conclusion is added, to help them, to grasp, this grand union of the
soul and the stars; this mystical chnin, which binds the in6nite multi-
plicity into unity, as well as diversity into identity.
We have, therefore, to regard man in a somewhat different light
from that in which we have hitherto considered him, viz.: we have
now to behold him as a grand, intelligent, spirito-material center, for the
expression of astro-celestial forces, upon the internal and external
planes of Cod's universe. Ma.,, broadly speaking, is a duplex mirror,
reOccting the steUar forces ill two directions; 1st., the astral inftux
from his body to the planes below humanity; 2nd., the 6ncr ethereal
essences of the stars from his soul to the aerial races in the spheres
above. The Srst comprises seven degrees of sub-mundane life, from
"1an to the mineral, forming as it were a lower octave of existence~
THE UNION OF THE SOUL AND THE STARS 283
the second is the ascending scale, or the higher octave of existence,
containing seven degrees of super-mundane life between man and
the angel. These seven degrees of super-mundane existence are the
aerial races of bright, immortal souls; the spiritual superiors of hu-
manity; in so far as concerns the realms they inhabit; and the more
etherealized conditions which surround them. These are the planetary
angels mentioned in the Ritual of divine magic. Planetary angels do
not exist upon the various objective planets, as so many occultists
imagine; but in the series of seven spheres between the planets and
the sun. But, on the other hand, these aerial races are very much in-
ferior to man; both in spiritual quality, soul power, and penetrative
force; and are utterly incapable of entering upon the physical strug-
gles of external life; hence, they are a purely subjective race; and are
never incarnated in matter (as we understand the term). They de-
pend upon the more positive spirit of humanity (which alone is
capable of entering and subjecting material forces) for all their
knowledge of external conditions.
The first degree in the higher octave consists of those souls who
have the most penetrative force, next to man; and are, consequently,
nearest to our physical conditions. Each degree in the ascending
scale· becomes less potent (materially); more ethereal and refined;
until it blends, in the seventh, with the purely spiritual or angelic
world.
In the lower octave of existence, viz.: the seven degrees of sub-
mundane life; countless beautiful worlds are open to the inspection of
the spiritual sight. We will briefly recount what we ourselves have
witnessed therein, as we speak of each degree.
The first degree in the lower octave is that of the crystallized
mineral, in which the life atoms are latent, so to say. The rocks and
stones are of both sexes, and impregnate each other with their mag-
netic forces. Their sympathies and antipathies constitute their laws
of natural selection; which we see manifested externally by the vege-
tation they produce from their soil. The second degree pertains to
the subjective spaces of the mineral world. The busy races \Vithin
the higher rounds of the mineral zone (the anima mineralis ), are
beautiful in every detail; each life atom busy at its appointed task;
happy beyond conception in its lowly spiritual state. As yet the
scintillating monad knows nothing of the greater worlds above. To
284 THE LIGHT OF EGYPT
it the mineral waves are the alpha and omega of its ideas. The third
degree of life passes in review as the vegetable kingdom, of which
sufficient is already known to the reader. The higher we go the brighter
the little creatures become. When we ascend to the fourth degree of
life, we behold ·the loveliest scenes that fairyland can present to the
eyes of the seer. The exquisite form and variety of these dazzling
elemental sprites are beyond language to describe. Each vortex or
space of the anima floralis constitutes a veritable paradise of beauty;
a wondrous world of delights; in which, the nymphs of the flowers
and the bright fairies of the floral world, sport like butterflies, in the
luminous ether of their round. The fifth degree passes before us as
the animal kingdom. The sixth degree of life expresses itself as the
semi-human round, the external correspondence of which may be seen
in the ape family. This realm of sub-mundane life contains the astral
world of the apes. It is these astral forms that are used by certain
magicians (after the human principle has vacated them) for occult
purposes. They become the trained elementals of magical science.
Their chief quality is imitation; and under the influence of their mas-
ter's mind they will personate anything; from an angel of light to a
goblin damned. The sixth degree is a world in which the soul begins
to put forth its attributes of self-consciousness; a realm wherein the
struggling monad gathers together the results of past sub-mundane
victories; and prepares to graduate to that higher life round; wherein,
it may commence to assume the human form. The seventh degree of
life is the embryonic human round; a spiritual zone or soul world,
wherein exists the multitudes of prepared souls awaiting the condi-
tions of their final incarnation. It is the realm of anxious expectations
and glowing ideals of what external human life may be. It is from
this state, or degree of life, that the human soul takes its last plunge
into objective material conditions; from which, it emerges to the sur-
face as the self acting, self conscious, individual man.
Let us now briefly turn our attention from man to the planet,
which he inhabits; and trace the correspondence. The planet, like
the man, may be designated as a duplex mirror; reflecting stellar and
planetary influx in two directions; 1st., to the various realms of ele-
mental existence (corresponding to sub-mundane life); termed cosmic
elementals; belonging to the four occult elements of Fire, Earth, Air,
and Water; 2nd., to the astro-magnetic zones of the planet (corres-
THE UNION OF THE SOUL AND THE STARS 285
ponding to the super-mundane realms), termed magnetic elementals.
The magnetic elementals are intelligent spirits known by various
names; such as fairies, fauns, elves, nymphs, etc. One very important
distinction must be noticed here; between sub-mundane and super-
mundane realms on the one hand; and cosmic elementals and mag-
netic elementals on the other hand; viz., that the two former are vari-
ous degrees of human soul life; hence possess the germs of immor-
tality, when the human state is attained; while the two latter are not
souls; and although they depend upon the soul of man for their differ-
entiated existence, yet they do not derive their supply of sustenance
from him; but from the latent forces within the planet, of each orb,
of the planetary chain; hence, they live only so long as the planet is
able to sustain them. Therefore, they are not immortal. When the
planet has fulfilled its material purpose, they, along with the orb which
gave them life, become a thing of the past.
We have now reached a most important link in our mystical chain,
viz.: since embodied man is the highest form of manifested existence
upon the planet, he is the grand polarizing point for all four of the
forms of existence, we have been describing. The human organism
is, therefore, the grand radiating center upon which the two vast
realms, stellar and psychic, impinge; and is the material 1ink, uniting
the soul and the stars. Thus, in very truth, is man the microcosm;
and the sacred adytum of the mysteries.
In order to render this more manifest, let us now endeavor to form
as clear an idea as possible of the nature and modus operandi of stellar
influx, as transmitted to man from our solar system; for, when we
comprehend that portion of the mystical chain, then we can form some
faint conception of the continued and unbroken chain, which binds
our solar system to other systems and constellations; on and on, to the
very interior of the soul, of the universe. First, then, stands our Sun;
and around it, like a group of obedient children, are the seven planets
of the mystical chain; (there are more than seven planets in the solar
system, but only seven in each octave of life); each orb giving birth
to an entirely different degree of life; so that the seven mystical de-
grees are completed. Each orb produces innumerable types of fauna
and flora, corresponding to the action of its own peculiar grade of
spiritual force. Each, therefore, comprises a miniature universe of
its own; and yet, at the same time; each planet contains all the forces
286 THE LICii.T 01} ECYPT
of the other six; only that, these six forces are latent; in so far as to
lend all their force, for the more complete manifestation of the domi-
nating one. Hence it follows, that our earth contains, in addition to
its own dominating degree of life, the latent forces of the variou•
grades of life active upon the other planets; so that Mars, Venus,
Mercury. etc., arc here with us; just as much as they are i.n the far
off spaces. Herein is contained the great mystery of planetary in-
Ouence upon man; for man, as before stated, is the highest type of
life upon the globe; and becomes the great radiator of the different
grades of life of the seven planets, comprised within the one he in-
habits. His sensitive sphere becomes the means of arousing count·
less races of astro-magnctic clcmentals into life and motion; and also,
into obedient servitude; if he only possesses the knowledge to direct
them; for each grade of planetary inOux renders service and protection
to the corresponding gr:ade of men. Thus; Mars to the martial natures,
Saturn to the saturnine, and jupiter to the jovial, and so forth. The
interior secrets of the talisman and the mysteries of magic are con·
cealed here: and the portals are open. for the soul's exploration. This
also, is the philosophic basis for the various statements that; certain
planets rule certain soul attributes, mental quaUties, physical instincts,
dasses of animals, plants, herbs, trees, minerals, precious stones, etc.
The reader who has followed us thus far, is now invited to join
us in a short trip to the astral world and there behold man as he pre-
sents himself to the vision of the seer. A most wonderous and dazzling
picture is before us, undreamed of mysteries connected with the
human form divine. Let us examine more c1osely. First, we observe,
that from the spinal column of the stately lorm of man; and from the
base of his luminous brain; iss-ue living streams of vitalizing force;
which, as they flow from the various points of his odylic sphere; be-
come refmcted into the seven rays of the spectrum. These rays of
living force from different individuals, become mutually attracted
toward each other; each color blends with its kindred color from other
organis-ms, and gravitates to its own particular level in the prismatic
ocean of life; until the whole of this mighty planet, with its millions
of human beings scattered over its throbbing surface; pre.c;:ents to the
eye of the initiated seer a perfect network of luminous springs, creeks,
rivers, and oceans of force; flowing from the radiating organism of
man. VVe also observei that these luminous oceans gradually assume
THE UNION OF THE SOUL AND THE STARS 287
the form of a spiral belt, which encircles 'the planet-penetrating to
its very center; and then expands itself, mist-like, within the planet's
atmosphere; where a prismatic reflection is cast around the earth;
constituting a sort of astral rainbow (if we may use such a term);
which is strictly confined within the limits of the planet's gaseous
envelope. This prismatic reflection is the astra-magnetic sphere, where-
in are formed the astral zones of the magnetic elementals, of planetary
influx, to which we have previously referred, as forming the grand
mystic links in the chain of life; which binds the organism of man
to the soul of the stars.
So far, we have only beheld our human duplex mirror from the
spinal column and the base of the brain; as he reflects the astral in-
flux from his body to the lower octave of life, termed sub-mundane;
we will now, therefore, regard the other half; or polar opposite sur-
face of our duplex mirror; wherein, the stellar forces are reflected
from the soul to the higher octave of life; the realms of super-mun-
dane beings.
We first observe, that, the odylic sphere of man; which forms
the oval surface of our living mirror; is constantly polished by the
vivid lightnings of the immortal soul within; next, we see that the
forces reflected from it are received directly from above, in an angle
to the left of the sphere; and that, after passing through and leaving
one portion to sustain the form and its functions; and also another
portion to be radiated to the sub-mundane planes; then, the higher
and more ethereal principles undergo a change of polarity; and are
reflected upward again, in an angle to the right of the sphere; to the
aerial races of super-mundane life. Let us now, therefore, enter within
the occult spaces of humanity, upon this spiritual plane; and describe
the phenomena as it passes in review before our spiritual sight.
Vi7e perceive that, from the millions of earth's inhabitants there
issues continual rays of reflected light; each ray partaking of the
peculiar color represented by the soul from which it is reflected. As
these rays ascend, they converge into streams and oceans, within
the astral light above the planet's atmosphere; (whereas, the former
astral belt, just described, was confined within the limits of the planet's
atmosphere). All of these luminous oceans of etherealized light seek
their own plane, and maintain a strict relation to each other, with
the mathematical exactitude of the solar spectrum. We also notice
288 'J'Il€ LlCIIT 0 1
•' F;CYIYJ'
that, these oceans Cow in one continual direction, viz.: in the opposite
direction to the orbital motion of the earth. They Bow backward in
the orbit. The writer cannot be positive upon this point, as these are
his own actual experiences, and are related here as they actually ap·
peared to him in the realms of spirit. It may be that, this backward
motion is only an appearance. caused by the earth moving forward;
just a.s the landscape from the window of a car in motion, appeal'S to
the occupant to be moving. But, in flowing backward, these oceans
graduaUly ascend, assuming the spiral form; the first rom>d hcing
about the same circumference as the eMth's annual orbit ahout the
Sun; but, increasing in size with each spiral, in the ratio of 1·2, 4·8,
16-32-64. These spirals assume their own special color; commencing,
first with that which is nearest to tl>c earth. which is Red: the 2nd.
Orange, the 3rd. Yellow, the 4th. C reen, the 5th. nlue, the 6th. Indigo,
and tl>e 7th. or last Violet. What there may be beyond this, we cannot
tell. All that we do know is, that it is the realm of the angels. These
spi_
rals, which we have just described, constitute mighty zones~ which
encircle an ethereal sphere or world of the same identical color;
similar to the brigh t rings round the body of Saturn. The clairvoyant
medium, Andrew Jackson Davis, undoubtedly saw these beautiful
etherealized zones, when he descril><-"<1 "the summer land'' in his
"Stellar Key." But he was quite mistaken in supposing them to be
the homes of disembodied lmmanity. As the reader has seen, they
are inhabited by aerial races, who cannot penetrate the outer envelope
of crystallized force; called obj~ctivc matter. We ne•.d scarcely add
that, these are the seven graduated spirit worlds, between the eartl1
and the Sun; constituting the chnin previously mentioned. These
spheres are the seven etherealized worlds, which form tl>e subjective
arc, between the planet and its parent center-man and the angel.
Still gazing at this sublime panorama of 1'\ature's wonderful for-
mations. within the spiritual spaces of the astral light; we perceive
that these astro-spiritual zones or belts contain the etherealized ma-
terials and essences of earth; which sustain the external life forces
of the aerial races, who inhabit these glorious worlds. The first world,
as we have previously shown1
is nearest to our physical conditions
and absorbs the coarsest poo'lions. The ne.<t, being more ethereal,
absorbs the next in spiritual quality. The finer tho essence, the higher
it ascends; so that the most ethereal of all reaches the confines of the

angelic world; and diffuses its violet aromas within the spaces that are
divine. As we perceive this fact; we instantly comprehend the grand
connection of the whole universe. MAN stands upon the central rung
of the cyclic ladder, as the meeting point of the equilibrium, between
the upper and the lower manifestations, of the great ONE LIFE. In
MAN lies concealed the sacred mystery of the lost word. He is the
wonderful microcosm. By his duplex action of body and soul, he be-
comes the grand conservator; the generator; and the radiator; of
spiritual and material life forces; first, absorbing the currents of the
life wave, then separating it into>its triune qualities; retaining one, then
re-polarizing and transmitting the grosser portions, in the form
of an astro-magnetic fluid, to the planes of life below; and reflecting,
from the mirror of his soul, in the form of an astra-spiritual essence,
the :finer and more ethereal portions, to the realms above. What
awful and unsuspected mysteries lie concealed within our being!
Verily, no mind can grasp all the mysteries of man.
Reader, the oceans of purified life essence; forming these spiral
zones of the interior heavens; which extend from the celestial worlds
to the earth; from the angels to man; and then, in a grosser form,
extend to our planet's very center; is the mystical chain of the great
one life; that unites man to all below him and binds him to the
immortal realms of life above. It is the spiral cycle of necessity
traversed by the life atoms; in their descent into matter, and in
their ascent into the realms of conscious spiritual existence. It
is the spiral cord of Nature whose vibrations, throughout the wide
universe of manifested being, proclaim the unbroken union between
the soul and the stars. The same yesterday, to-day and for evermore.
The mysteries of man are the mysteries of God, and who can
solve them here on earth? The soul answereth, "none." So be it.
In conclusion, we will only add that as a child of God, or the
crystallization of force; as a spiritual entity, or a thing of dust;
man's birth-right is ever the same; a progressive conscious immor-
tality. He is the sustainer of the universes below, of which even oc-
cultists have scarcely dreamed, and he is the generator of the essences
which sustain the life of myriads in brighter worlds than ours.
