    Summary&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Psychic Science Monthly.
 Non-Sectarian.
 Devoted to collecting and publishing Scientific Evidence of the Continuity of Life after the change called Death
 1919  Monthly
 Detroit, MI.  Publisher: Psychic Science Publishing Company.  Editor: Charles E. Watkins, James H. Sutton.
 1/1, June 1919.  8 pp., 50 cents a year.

 Though tricked out in the garb of a standard spiritualist journal, this, as its discoverer, Brandon Hodges, notes was simply Dr. Watkins' effort to achieve bulk second-class postage rates for what was in reality an advertisement for his wonderful version of the planchette, "Watkins' Original Psycho Writer, called by many the Despair of Science" ($2.00 postpaid).  Watkins appeared in the spiritualist press as a slate reader in the 1870s and 1880s and seems to have learned the wonders of mail-order marketing in his old age.  He also touted a "Wishing Table" and a Psycho Club, whose Grand Master was the obviously related A.M. Watkins.
