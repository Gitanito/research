  		              		Experience Description   

    Driving down the road, I was going fast through a curve. My car made a loud, breaking noise in the back and began to slide. The car started to roll and I was not belted in. I knew for a second that I was upside down. Then, I my head was in the seat, with my arms crossed at the chest.  I was mashed against steering wheel with my  legs twisted and jammed between the gear shifter and the radio. I wriggled free and laid on ground. I had no sensation of cold despite it being the middle of winter. I had  no shoes or socks, no coat, and only a shirt and jeans. I felt no  pain even though my head and face were busted open and the right arm was completely crushed. I felt no pain from the time of the accident until waking up after surgery. 

  As I lay on ground, I felt myself fading away and the real world landscape was replaced with a faraway glowing light. As I moved closer to the light, I could see it had three black things it. As I got even closer, the black things lightened in color.  They were my deceased mother, grandmother and dog. We exchanged hellos.  I remember feeling sheer joy and excitement and wanting to hug them.  I couldn't see myself, but as I moved to touch them, they said that I must not do that  as they backed away. No words were exchanged with our mouths, only telepathically. I made another effort to hug them and they backed away again. I told them I wanted to stay. They said I couldn't because it wasn't my time yet and that I needed to go back. They told me goodbye while I protested. Then they began to slide backwards toward the brightest part of the light until they faded away. 

Then, while I was feeling disappointed, I could hear medical personnel and other people talking but I could not see them. On the ambulance ride to the hospital, my vision returned and I could see the lady technician who was working on me.
