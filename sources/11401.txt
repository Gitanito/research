I was cutting meat, and the knife went into my hand and then way down into the meat, and the bleeding was hard to stop.  I had a hard time finding a rag to hold pressure on the cut.  I was bleeding pretty good and started to feel weak and faint.  I sat down in the truck and passed out.  I'm not sure if I quit breathing.  

I started traveling fast towards something, and, real or not, I think it was hell.  I saw a dark, rugged, rocky landscape with tall, jagged rocks sticking up all over.  In the distance, there was a giant orange glow with dark streaks going up.  I found myself looking into a sort of giant cave entry with enough room for everybody.  When I came to, I was sweating profusely.  I was terrified and didn't know where I was.  Nothing like this had ever happened to me before.
