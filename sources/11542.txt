  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a rough life as a child growing up. My parents were very strict with me, not allowing me to have any friends. They kept me in the house and even had a tutor coming to the house to school me. At age 16, I got sick of it all and just wanted to end my life. I took a whole bottle of my fathers medications, which I believe had something to do with his heart. My mother had been out running errands. When she came home and found me on my bed,  I was just barely alive. She called 911 and they rushed me to the nearest hospital. I was taken directly into the emergency room and they immediately began working on me. They were trying to pump my stomach for any remaining pills, hooking me up to machines, and etc. I could hear everyone talking and the doctors giving instructions to the nurses on what do to. Then I heard the words, 'We are losing her!' I could hear my heart barely beating on the heart monitor, and then it stopped. 

  I was standing outside my body at the head of my body, but behind all the emergency room staff as they worked frantic to revive me and bring me back to life. I wasn't in any pain. In fact, I felt nothing. But I stood there in shock to see my body  lying on the gurney while they worked on me. I watched as they pulled out the pads to shock my heart, put tubes down my throat, and were placing IVs in my arm. 

  Then, I felt a tap on my left shoulder.  I turned to look at who it was and then I was gone. That's when I found myself surrounded in total darkness. There were no floors, no walls, no ceiling - nothing. I was huddled down with my arms wrapped around my folded legs and my head buried in the bends of my knees, in a fetal position. Then I heard a voice; it was a deep voice but it was  comforting at the same time. I turned to look in the direction of the voice and saw a man standing there. He had no wings, so I assume he wasn't an angel. He was wearing a long, leather coat that went all the way to the floor. His hair was combed back as if he had gel in it. The man was standing there and appeared as if he had something in his fingers,  like he was playing with it or rolling it around. But there was nothing in his fingers, kind of like picking at his finger nails. 

  He tilted he head towards me and said 'This isn't want you wanted, it is?' I was starting to cry and replied, 'No, it was stupid and I was only trying to get attention.' Then he said to me, 'Do you see the light?' I looked around and far off into the distance was this light, like looking through a prism with rainbow colors generating from it. But it was very far away and very little to see, but it was there. That's when he said to me, 'Suicides are not allowed to receive the light; they remain in darkness.' I don't know if he was using this as a scare tactic to frighten me, or if he was speaking the truth, but I wasn't going to question him. Then he spoke the words which I will never forget as he said, 'Life is a gift and it's not up to us to take it.' 

  At first, I didn't understand what he meant.  But later, I knew as I figured it out. He then said to me, 'It's not your time and I am going to send you back. But I am also going to put you to work for us. You'll know when the time is right and how to accept it and learn how to use it.' I had no clue as to what he meant by that, but I agreed with him. I  told him, 'Thank you' and I was sent back. 

  I woke up lying in a hospital bed, connected to so many machines, with tubes down my throat. There were heart machines and so many sounds of beeping. I was hooked up to an oxygen machine and anything else they could connect me to. But when I awoke, I heard voices. I heard  sounds like I was  standing in a crowded room and everyone was all talking at once. It was  like being at a party or a gathering. But the only people there were  the nurses sitting at the nurses station next to me. They weren't talking, but working quietly,  staring at patient charts and writing down notes in them. I realized I was in the ICU unit and there were other patients in there with me. The nurse came over to check on me and noticed my eyes were open. She was excited and started asking me to blink, node my head, move my fingers and toes.  I had no problem doing any of it. I looked at a clock on the wall across from me, and it was showing 2:00 a.m. I was able to turn my head and look out a window. I noticed  it was dark outside, so I assumed I had been out for just a few hours. My mother must of found me earlier, around 4:00 p.m. on my bed.  

  I thought I had only been out until 2:00 a.m. that morning. I was wrong. The nurse told me that I had been in a coma for 32 days! She told me  not to try and do anything strenuous and  not to speak too much because  I needed to rehabilitate myself. I was  weak and my mind was a huge blank. I don't remember anything while being in this coma, nothing. I had no dreams, I heard no noises; it was just one big blank. I wanted to know why I heard all these voices around me, so I asked the nurse. She asked, 'What voices?' At that point, I  thought I might have brain damage. I was assured that there was nothing wrong with me. As far as brain damage was concerned, I was fine. 

  It was another week before they released me, as doctors ran tests on me to make sure there wasn't any damage. My parents came to visit and spent time with me.  They were mad of course, but soon realized  that I wanted to have a normal childhood and to be treated right. Then I got released and sent home, but also was on doctors orders to remain on bed-rest and try to regain my strength back before doing anything. 

  The voices continued, but not as much since I was at home. A few years later, I realized that I was hearing the dead speak. They didn't talk to me, but I could hear them. When  I acknowledge them,  then they were talking to me and excited that I could hear them and speak to them. It took years to figure it all out and learn to adjust to my new gift. I had to  learn to shut it off, like turning off the dial on a radio to make the voices stop. Then I  only would allow them to speak to me when I was ready or wanted them to speak to me. Now, being 58 years old, I use this gift to help the dead receive the light. I also help others who are wanting to end their life.  I let them know it's not the way out, and what will happen if they do. I share my experience with them. Now I know why that man sent me back and said he had work for me to do. Now I understand and use my experience and gifts  to help others who are stuck in between realms or are stuck on earth in spirit. My gift is powerful, and sometimes it is more than I can handle. But I have proven to many that it's real and showed them to prove my point. I have made the ones who doubt, believe.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It took about 15 years. I didn't want anyone thinking I was a nut job. I still am careful of who I tell or show my gift. But I have proven my gift to even the skeptics. It shocked them.
