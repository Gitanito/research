  		              		Experience Description   

    I was diving with a guide and a buddy in the red sea. At the time of the accident, we were 20m below sea level. I was following the guide, and my buddy was far behind me, which made me in the middle between them but far from both of them. 
  
  At this point, I realized I am breathing part water and part air from my regulator. I thought something was wrong with my regulator. The real problem was that I wasn't familiar with the mouth piece.  It was different from other regulators that  I had during my other dives. The regulator  slipped from my mouth gradually without me noticing that water was coming in. I forgot  the regular practices to do in case of emergencies.   I also had given the wrong sign to the guide, which delayed his response. 
  
  I then made a terrible mistake by taking the regulator out of my mouth and threw it behind me before finding the alternative regulator first. This made me panic even more. I was frantically searching all the wrong places for the alternative regulator until until I found it.  I didn't take it out from the BCD. Instead, I moved it and my head closer to one another to get a deep breath. But the piece I should breathe from was inverted, which made the attempt of deep breath turn to taking only water in.
  
  At this point, I didn't feel the need to breathe. I was comfortable with not breathing and I calmly looked above to see how far I was from the sea surface. I was 20m below sea level. When I found the surface was too far to rise to, I calmly said to myself, 'That's it. That's how I am going to die.' I didn't think of anything or anyone. I then enjoyed the beautiful water colors with the sun coming through. I felt comfort and serenity like I never felt before in my life. It was like a beautiful moment in a dream. Then everything turned black and I passed out. 

  I woke up to the regulator in my mouth, and my buddy pressing the purge button to create air pressure to allow air into my lungs.
