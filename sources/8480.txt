  You, the reader, are the   judge.&nbsp; Here is the evidence, carefully prepared ,   thoroughly documented, described topic by topic, and   professionally  presented.&nbsp; You must decide.&nbsp; Of considerable  importance  is the subject of this case, is there or   is there not evidence  that there is an afterlife for   all humanity, but especially  for you.&nbsp; You realize   that this could be the most important  case that you   have ever judged.
  &nbsp;
  As the author has described:&nbsp; &quot;If a judge has to assess the   evidence  presented to him/her, the level of persuasion for the  evidence  (the information in the book) to be accepted   should be over  51%- in civil matters the test of   acceptance is one of the 'balance  of probabilities.'&nbsp;   Usually the issues to be taken into consideration  by   the jury (or the judge if not a jury matter) are : the   quality and the credibility of the witnesses, their
  qualifications  and experience, and whether expert   information is objective , repeatable, verifiable,   etc.&quot;

  In this matter, the lawyer   presents his case in 27 chapters.&nbsp; Each chapter deals with a special   concept that may be important to  the final  judgment .&nbsp; These presentations range from an Opening   Statement to a presentation of What Happens When we Die ?&nbsp;   Concepts that are presented to you include a wide range of so-  called  &quot;psychic phenomena&quot; and include the scientific   observation of  mediums, materialization, electronic   voice phenomena, out of body  experiences, near-death   experiences, death-bed visions, and
  many  more.

  This book is highly   recommended to any reader who is interested in  the   afterlife.&nbsp; Especially, this book is highly recommended to   those  scientists who are concerned about whether human  consciousness  can be explained by a skull full of   brain cells or
  whether  there is a better explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  In the   judgment  of this reviewer, the time is long past for scientists to   seriously consider  the nature of human consciousness   and include such studies  as part of physical   science.&nbsp;
