  		              		Experience Description   

    Posted in Zhi Hu on 5-7-2017   

  I had severe insomnia for sometime, so got a prescription for sleeping pills from the hospital. Initially, I got a five-day supply and it worked quite well. Over time though,  I developed a tolerance to the medicine, such that one pill did not help me to sleep.    
  
    One night around 8 pm, I experienced the first time without sleep for the whole night. I felt extremely sleepy, then I closed my eyes but still could not fall asleep. I took 3 pills, instead of one so that  I could  have a good night sleep. After taking the pills, my chest hurt like I was being punched by someone. It was very unbearable and I had trouble breathing.  No matter how  I changed my body position, I still felt uncomfortable.    
  
    I opened the window and tried to breathe the fresh air, thinking it might help me feel better. My chest pain went away, but I lost consciousness for the next 3 seconds and dropped down to the floor. I lay on the floor for 30 minutes without any pain.    
  
    As I reflected on this experience, the weirdest moment was when I was unresponsive. I dreamt that I was in a vast emptiness where there were no trees, animals, or even grass. I stood there in confusion.    
  
    Then I saw two tall people with  fuzzy faces and wearing hoodie-robes who appeared before me. They asked me to follow them. I had never experienced this surreal and strange feeling before. I just knew it was all right to go with them. Still, this felt odd and very unfamiliar. I followed them as we walked a long way.    
  
    Suddenly, it seemed like there was a warm light appearing up above my head that was  coming down. I was told, 'Don't continue, stop going forward!' Anyway, I knew in my head that I had to leave these two people. Then, I ran like crazy towards the light. Initially, one of them tried to grab my hand but he didn't get to me. They  stood there while watching me run. I kept running to  the light. I felt much safer afterwards. 

Instantly, I woke up. I wrote down all the details to remember this special dream. I think it was an exceptional experience.
