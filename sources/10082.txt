  		              		Experience Description   

  About 10 years back, I had a voiding vagal reflex in the middle of night. I don't remember the time, but I got up to urinate. The bathroom door was less than 1 metre from the bed and the commode was right in front of the door. While voiding, I felt my head start to reel.  I thought it was postural hypotension, and told myself to go back to bed as soon as I finish. But I went unconscious before I could get back to bed. I found myself sitting on the floor and holding the commode pan. I had  injured myself with a tooth-bite on the lower lip. The next day, I told my wife and she believed me when she saw the injury. Then I got a thorough check-up and the doctors made a provisional diagnosis of TIA or Voiding Vagal reflex.
  
  This same thing happened after about 7-8 years later in another house. In a similar fashion, I got up and went to bathroom.This time there was no head-reeling but I  blacked out.  In that blackness, I found myself falling downward and with increasing speed. Everything was black all around me.Though it appeared like a tunnel,  I did not feel any limits or a wall. I was trying to hold onto what I thought might be a wall with my arms spread wide open. I continued to fall, more like slipping, to a deeper place at a very high speed. I do not remember how long I was falling. But after some time, I fell to a void and my speed reduced but did not stop. It was dark everywhere and there was a cold void.  I felt like I was floating.  I became flat and did not feel anything. Next I found myself lying on the floor,  with my legs and hand spreaded out. Very quickly I composed myself and tried to remember what I saw and felt . That part of my memory is still hazy in my mind, even today. 
  
  Again I described this blackout to my doctor colleagues who advised me to be careful. Again the diagnosis was  a TIA resulting from vagal reflex.

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

  What is your religion now?         Hindu   As above. More strongly believe man has created Man, not vice versa

Myself with my body moved to an unknown place and I was all alone. I called no one. It was happening at high speed and suddenly stopped in a void. Like a space flight where one floats.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life.     Not sure if anything has greatly changed. I take it as a medical event and accept it.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Probably there is a loss of memory of the incidence just prior to the experience like entering the bathroom, whether I looking up or down during urination. Do not remember the sound of urine falling in the pan. I do not remember how I opened the trousers.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Probably I think I am dreaming more often than before. Not very sure.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Shared my experience but not in as much detail as it is described above. As I come from a doctor community every one suggested Cardiovascular and Neurological evaluation for a possible loss of blood supply to brain. Nothing came out.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real.      I could not make out what it could have been.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably not real.      As of today I think its a dream-like sequence after reading so much about NDE  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Sometimes I feel like having a similar calmness in life again. Sometimes I think if similar experience can be attained with deep meditation it would be a great experience.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It's OK to a large extent. One question can be added asking if person have heard stories of Soul moving around after death and only goes away after performing some rituals as per Hindu custom ... for Hindus.
