            		Experience Description:   

As a result of a mistake made by a doctor, I was operated on. After the operation, I was in the intensive care unit. Suddenly I was in a desert. At the same time, I was on my bed. Sometime I was being lost in the sands of the desert; but suddenly I was returning to the reality. And sometimes I was going deep in the water. I could not breathe. I had no sexuality. I was a creature who did not look like me. I had no hair on my head. I tried desperately to climb out the water. Then I began to fly over the desert. There were some green spots in the desert. While I was looking down to earth, I saw some animals looking like rabbits. I felt like I was watching a documentary.

That was all. I didn't see any light or tunnel. I am ready to answer any questions. I haven't able to forget this experience. I'm not sure if I can trust you. Sometimes the interest in the new age trends (yoga, astrology etc.) seem to me very artificial and commercial.
