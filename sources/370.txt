      Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Occult Magazine, The.
 A Monthly Journal of Psychical and Philosophical Research.
 A chronicle of strange, and secret, and forgotten thingsâ€”Shelley
 1885-1886  Monthly, then quarterly
 Glasgow, Scotland; then Loudsville, GA.  Publisher: Hay Nisbet & Co..  Editor: Peter Davidson.
 Succeeds: Occultist
 Corporate author:  H.B. of L. (Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor)
1/1, February 1885-2/21-23, October-December 1886.

 This was started as The Occultist, but after disputes with John Thomas, the publisher of that journal, it was begun anew under this title.  This was the organ of the H.B. of L., the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, the most influential practical occult group in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and an avowed enemy of the "Buddhistic Mahatmas" of the competing Theosophical Society.  Davidson later edited The Morning Star.  LOC; National Library of Scotland; University of Manchester
