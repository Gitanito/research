~ TeE Conviction of the Defendant, a~ a rogue and vagabond;
~by T-homas Leach, Esq. was gi~en in an~ reitd. ·
._, ~ Mr. CONST (Counsel for the Prosecuhon) then addressed
'\ the Chairman, as follows :-'{ Sir, This is a case in
~ which the Defendant has been already convicted by a
J:iiMagistrate, under the Vagrant Act, at the .instance of Mr~
Blair; who;• I cannot help saying, has been rather harshly
treated by some of the public·prints, for becoming the Prose..
cutor of this man ; and I have no doubt that when the evi- _
dence bas been· heard, the 'court will think he deserves the
thanks Qf the.publi~ for what he has done. [See Note'I.]
u The circumstanc4s of this case are wetly similar to.
lVhat baye been before the Court on two former occasions, .
when this man has been the subject of conviction aQd of ,
punishment; notwithstanding which, he has ·each time re4
turned lo his fo-rmer practic,s, and gone ~ precisely in the
fame ·way.

fined himself merely to that trifling ahd ludicrous· kind of
traffic, which has been said in the newspapers to be tpe subject
of prosecution by Mr. Blair; 'fi>r you will find by the papers
which were taken in his pos~ssion, (Note II.] that in his
attempts to impose on ~redutous persons, he baa been the.
id'strument of greater mischief than is generally supposed : ,
for, beside those common ridiculous pretended calcula- ·

which he corresponds with different persons, you will find
that he has had a much larger. intercourse with the world;
that he has been the means of encouraging servants and
other persons, by pretended calculations,, to hazard their last
shill~~g in lotteries, little goes, and other ·iof~rior species of
gambling; (Note Ill.] -tiieevif consequences of which, I am

" One is apt to smile at these kind ofprophecies, becal-1se we

culous: bu~ in this great town the dominion of folly is so strong

too gross not to impo~e on s.ome individuals.
"The hand-bi11 ofthis man [Note VJII.] (ofwhich we find
more than ten thousand have been pri11ted by one of hi11
printers in the last summer months) being left at the house of
Mt. Blair, with hi.s maid-servant, it' happened to be placed
where Mr. Blair saw it; and having seen it, he thought it not
an improper opportunity to ascertain wh~ther this ·.Astrologer
woul<l pretend to do what the bill stated. He therefore let '
his man-servant go with a letter, making inquiries concerning
his felJow-sen'ant; and paid.the defendant half a CrOWll, \Vhcn
the defendant gave him a sort of nativity, which will Le pro- _
ouced. There is a good deal of it.for the money ; for he states
.the whole destiny which was to await the young woman, re-
specting whom it was obtained, the person she was to marry,
the children she was to have, the c~untrics · into which she
was to travel, and the lucky and unlucky years of heP.lifc.

Prisoner. I am·exceeding1y !Sorry for what I have do.Qe;
I had no manner of ways or means lo do for myself, and my
wife and ~hi/4 : we were in the greatest distress ; a~d I _aid
not know what to do to support existence, until J could get
work to earn a little money. I have now betln promised con-
.5tant employment; I have no objection at all to work ; and l
have many people to testify that I have work;d for thorn. J
have worked in gardens; I have cleaned house; I ha.ve
cleaned ~indows ;'1 011-ve 'beat carpe's; I hl\'e scoured rooms;
I have done any thing I could get to do,; but I could not

spare m~ this once; I will d• any thing before I will do this ,
_.in. Bu.t, if you had seen \l:S in our distress, you would .
have pitied wi. There · are married respt!ctable people who

Mr. MAJNWA.ltING. · You are brought })ere in the mqst.
merciful maiiner you could be ; for if you had Peen prought
here, as you very properly might have been, with two former
coavictions for. the same offence attaching to you, you wOdld
h.ave been in:a very lamentable situation ; for .the Cour,, in ·
justice to _the public, would have been called upon to'pas&.a
very dreadful sentence,upon you.
Priso11er. God forbid!
Mr. MAINWA.BING. You laid yourself open to that ; but
by the mercy of those who have br<>Ught you here, you stand
at the bar as if yon wel'e but for the first time an offender.
You yourself know, this is not the case; but, from your
conduct you appear to be so incorrigible, thst there is no hope
pf your amendment. As to what you state, that you could
. do npthing else, that is what e\'ery rogue 'who goes about the
town may say :-" I could get nothing to do, and therefore I
was obliged to pick that gentleman's pocket; or, I was
obliged to kaock down that poor woman, and take from !)er
what she had." You ha.ve no want of words, and you ha~
plenty of ingenuity, and surely you might get into ,something:
however, whether you can or not, you must net continue
this employment.

APPENDIX AND NOTES.
PAoE 3, Note 1. To obvia~e the meffects of the gro~
misrepreseniations which have been industriously circulated
~y different newspapers,. r~spectiog tbe case of Josep~ Powell.
as well as to remove the odium that bas been i;as.t on one of
the members of '~The Society for the Suppression of Vic.c,0
who was insU:umental \n apprcrhending this offender, it haf
\>Ceu.deemed an.act. of justice by the Society to publish al\
authentic account of the circurostance:i conaected with t.hi.t
prosecution. Ai1d, for that purpose,, Mr. Blair was requ'li;tcJ·to
put the Society's Secretary i.n possession of sut:h books, papers.
im.I other do.cuments as h,ad fallen into his bauds, relative
to this busine•s;. togcrther witla the abusive letters., &c, wbicb
had been sent to biin by v.arious persons,. who strenuously de-
fended the cause of Powell I · .
Fro.m these ample roatei:i.als,. the Society ue cpable<l to Clc-
snonsti:ate the exte~ve evil of thi~ man's practices, at1.l to
vindicate the prosecution be(ore an io-lpartial wurld, whe will
now see how much they are indebted to tbc «!urlious. of Mr.
BlaiJ. The lette(s and <tther manuscripts (selected from a large
bundle) which ha.ve chiefly furaish~d the contco.ts of the fol-:-
Jowin' pages, were pruduce.d in Court, at the Clerkenwdl·
Sessio.

w_
ere sufficiently clear from the bare testimooy ofthe witnesses,
it was not deemed necessary to read many of them duri.ns., th.:
trial. The facts hete discllilS~d must ~nd, in a very strrking
manner, toope1t.the eyes ofthose unguarded females, who had
been induced to hazard their reputation by consulting so
v.icioue llJ). impos.wr : and it is hoped, that this deveJop.ement
of facts may contribute to undec.eive the c9mmon people, re..
s~ting the r.C~ clµracter of "Fortune Tdlers."

spondence with her pretended husband until the 10th of Oc-
tober last? being.the daY when th~s ;imposto! was take~ befott
the Magistrates m H~tton Street. The printed books found
in his possession were mostly Almanacks, astronomical tables.
and the publication of Mr. Brothers, the pseUdo-prophet,with
large quantities of printed lottery numbers, .&c. ·
· Page 4, Note Ill. ·One of the chief sources of profit to ·
this .impostor, seems to have been the sale of " lucky nun1.::
bets" in the lottery. It is really surprising to observe, what
a .vast variety of memorandums he had relating to this sub-
ject. The evils attendant on the state-lottery must be very great
indeed, among the lower classes oftnankind; and it is much
\o be wished that means could be soon devised ofabolishing
this species.of legal gambling. We shall here add one specimen
of the letters found among Powell's papers on the lottery.

Page 5, Note VI. In answer to a letter, da.ted September
15th, r807, from a lady (whose name we 'conceal) residing
near Holborn, making inquiry as to the terms on which
Powell· would cast her nativity; he writes, "As· your letter
have every appearance ·of heing rr:al, I let you know my
terms: for speaking is, as you saw in the bill, ·2s. 6d. But
for casting of a nativity, that is of different price, from ! a
G. to 5 Guineas; tor· thare is a vast of difference in telling
an<l in calculating, Iihie or much, in part or in full : for one

ferred to by Mr. Con1t, and which was·han<led up to the Ma-
gistl':ltes, with se\·eral o\hers, in the hand-writing of Joseph:

' " I have looked into t.bc Rules of Astrology, In respect to.

Page _5, Note VIII. Ten thous:.\nd copies of f>owdl's
hand-bill were printed in the summer of 1807, by Mr. Bar~ .
field, of \V:ardour Street; but, it appears from different co-
pies of the bill, that variolls other printers were cmpfoyed.
\Ve may infer, from the great number of these liand-bills
ci1'culated, how extensively this man's name was likdy to be
known : and it seems, from one of his letters written toa(eqj'Ale,
that he must have .b~en very sueccssful in obtaining 11101icv';
for he say11 tci her, " You heps yourselffrom preferment a~1d

reason, -that. tbe le'tter which Thomas Bam~s wrote· to the
Astrologer was calculated to deceive any othtr person, :l(nd
that it w.as therefore laying· an unfair trap for him, we have
thought 1noper to subjoin a literal copy of that letter; from
which the reader will perceive it to have ~n just such a
one as naturally arose from the perusal of the Fortune-teller's
advertisement : and he probably received tl\any other letter&
nearly similar. , · :
" To A. Ji. No~ 5, Sulto• Street, Soho Square.

" [ have lhis morning received your

addresses to ber? I beg the favour of an early ans,ver, 'and
desire to know what .wil~ be your· charge for resolving the
~bove questi~o." · ·
Page n,.Note X. Moet of the papers found in PoweU's
pdssession, aod appearing to be answers to persons desiring
' fo have " their \lativities cast," are· of a similar kind to,the
C>ne sold to Thomas Barnes : but it often happens, that they
<;ontain very djsnial prophecies of what wo,•1ld take place
tn fotnre years,- and sometimes even pretending to foretel the
geath of <litferent. iOdividu.als ! Such ·kinds of predictions are
,<:alculatecl .tQ produce irreparable m~chief, not only to the
deluded people wbQ may be thereby induced to regulate their
tonduct according to the suppt>sed facts communicated by
the fortune-teller, .but also may. be productive of dreadful
evils to whole families and connexions allied to tbem. Some
of t.he application~ to Powell require information n:specting
the death of parents; and, without doubt; unthinking or ill-
iristructed children might be tempteel to act very improperly,
in consequence of the answers· they receive' to such intefl'Oga-
torie!t. How probable it is, that young and giddy persons ·

-he was treated with extreme lenity, this third time of con-
viction,_ in not hl!-ving been prosecuted with the utmost- ri-
gour of the law. The lcnity of his treatment is besides still
• more apparent, when it is con~idered that .nearly the whoJe
course of his life had been a system of deception, and that
.he told a series ofdirect falsehoods during his late examioa•
· tion at the Police Office in Hatton Street.
Page 13, Note XII. It is worthy ofobservation, thaf the
prisoner at the Clcrkenwell Sessions pleaded first of all the
distressed state of his ' 1 wife and cJ1ild," as an excuse for h~
~al-practic.es ; but that, being afterwards brought into a di-
lemma by the allegation of George \Vood, {one -of the wit-
ue!)ses,J he declared " his wife WO$ deud." If we can rely
on his own deposition, given to· Mr. Aris, jun. while he
remained in th~ House of Correction, prior to this last trial,
the said wife " had been dead about nine years, and was bu..
.ried .in St• .l?ancras churchyard ;" two children, wlii~·h he
.had by her, being wboH.y provided for, "by his br-Othcr and
sister near the Spotted Dog, at Hammersmith." He also
ioaid, that he belonged to St. Ann's parish, Soho. ,In oppo·
aition, however, to these :oeveral statements, we sh_
all here
Jay before our readers the A11trologer'1 first repreSf"ntatiOQ to
,Jhe Magistrates in Hatton Street, as it was inserted in " The
Times" of October 12th, 18"7 ; viz. " The wretc_hed ppj-

lean, in faint and trembling accents, £1c addressed the Ma-
gistrate. He acknowledged the truth of the ch4rge agaim t
him ; but he said nothing, save want and the miseries of a
wr,tc4edfamily, could have dri\'en him to adopt such a modt

And eveq if begging, ·either by private solicitatio•, or open
in thq streets, could promise him a casual resourse in the cha-
rity of the passing crowd, be was afJaid he should .thereby
~ncur prosecution as a rogue and vagabond, and be con$igneJ

W!!-S even now roaming and raving through the streets,, her
disorder aggravated by hi.s misfortune:J, and his wretched
children without raiment or food. To him, tleath would be
.a wdcoPl!! relief from a hurthen of existence, .tolerable only
in the hope of being able to afford, by some means, :i wretched
subsisteuce to his fat11ily." .
The reporter in THE TIMES says "the l\fagistrQtes were
obvio:usly ·a.fleeted by tlzis scene," but " that they felt them-
selves obliged to commit the prisoner;" as if it were not an
act of the most manifest propriety and duty to commit him
for trial ! This artful and false statement was not onlv calcu-
lated to excite the commiseration of an humane pU'blic, in
behalf of a poor man so apparently "persecuted illto t/w toils
Pf justice,'' as it has since been called ; but was likdy to
.bring clown a heavy torrent of abuse upon the individmil who,
·from patriotic feclings, caused Powell to be apprehended~
And this, in fact, has actually ·been the conaequence of such
a Hagrant misrepresentation in the newi:;paper alludl!d to !
The account ~a~ copied from '' 1'ke Times" into a number
of other daily p:-ints, as VI.ell, as the Sunday papers: and to
some of these were annexed, the most virulent and insulting
obsen·ations, intended to expose the prosecutor to the con-
tempt and indignation of every humane reader; so that the
~fli.:cts .\\fhich ensued, partly from Powell's own mis-state-
ments, but much more fr<:>m the glosses and errors of the firat
l·cporter in " Tl;.e Times," ·were of a ' very unpleasant nature
totht; gentleman in question. But this was not all: .for it
was represented, without any pretence, whate\•er, that the
prosecutor acted from the first under the . influence, ;md with
the concurrem·e, of the ~' Society for the S!.!ppression of
Vice;" and hence the well .known Editors of i;e;.icral journal~,
whose spirit ha$ always been adverse to its laudable dl!Sign11,
loo!<. occasto,n to ·write, that " the Society which .so dex-
trously entrapped the poor Astrologer Powell; seems dcter-

· fraud to fl~urish but its own.'' This ill-foi:mded am! inde-
<'ent language wu even transcribed into so\ne of the ~vitt•
cial papers, which seemed to "ie with The " ]}fm·nin,g Ck,-o-
nicle,'' The " J:{e,,,.~," and The '" Statesman," in coarse.
nesis and ·malignity! Nay, so bitter and unreasonable was
the damour excited on this occasion, that after the d1.1ails of
..the trial bad been pltblishc<l in fi\'C or six of the daily prints,
certain .persons persevered in .casting still further oble>quy o>i
the gcntlem11n who had caused Powell to be apprehended.
Page 14, Note XI IJ. It might have been expected, aftet
the Magistrates, at a solemn trial of this impostor, had de-
clared Mr. Blair to be " deserving qj' tlte tlwitks ofthe publit:
for what he had done," that no individual could be so auda-
cious as to throw out any sub;>equent reflections on that gl"tt-
tleman fur bringing the prisoner to the bar of jt'hilice ! . Yet,
as we have said, the result was far otherwise; so tl~itt it"ap.:-
peared to be incumbent on " the Society for the Suppression
of Vice," to lay before the world sotne indubitable 1m1ofs 'of
the prisom:r•s guilt, exclusive of what had transpired thr~
the medium of the newspapers. And, this bas been deemed
the more.necessary; because an uncommon deal of pains have
been since taken to bring the Society into discredit, for aid-
ing and abetting one of its members in the prose<:ution. · ·
The truth is, toot the'Society did co-o~rate with Mr. Blair
in prosecuting Powell ; though it had nothing at all to do in
first apprehendine: and convicting him on the 10th of October.
The Soaiety, a\;arc of the mi~reptesent':ltions employed to
deceive the public, thought proper to engage learned C<mnsd,
in order that the real facts and.importance of this case might
be made known, u·hil..h otherwise could not have- been ilon¢
~o effectually.
If more attention has been excited about this man tliaa
could have been foreseen, or than his case seemed to.·merit;
· this must be attributed to the hue-and-cry raised hy hts ad.;
hereuts. against those who carried on the proSt:cution. F01\
the most violent and unprecedented clamollr has certainly
been raised on this occasion, beyond what the Society had
any idea of; and which can .only .be explained, by supposing
that it was regardell as a fit opportunity fo, holding' np th~
Institution to general oJium. The pltblic, ho,•evt:r, will now

allegation; but it is one \\thich ought to be set in its true
Jight, on accpunt of those persons who considered Powell u
Jn object ofcompassion rather than of reprehension.
The pretended wife, whom Powell described as insane)
.when- he was examined by the Magistrates in Hatton Street
Police Office, .is named Elizabeth .W ••·•• n. She has ll •

deavour to make herself agreeable.''
Most of the·amorous epistles above mentioned, with many
more, were written in 1806 and 1807; so that Powell's cir-
cumstances were not such as to preclude his const1nt atten-
tions to the other sex, notwithstanding his plea of poveny
when he was last apprehended. · · . ·
Consideration for the individuals implicated, pre\'Cnts t~
publication of many letters, which throw lig,ht on the con-'
duct and character of Powell; but it is manife~t from some oe
them, that his intri~ues have been Yery deep·and numerous. ··
. In.one of his epistles addressed to a gentleman ·who la_.
mented the loss of his daughter, and written in April 18079
Powell savs: " Isaw her the nd clav 0fJauuarv, and found that
she went ~f with the person that I ;uspected, Namely ·William
M ••••• II, he.has a Wife and Child now living-he took
Nancy from me, expecting she had 15ool. for her fortune.'':
.. . • • . . . .. " If she would forsake that man, I would make
her.Comfortable for it is in my power.'' In answer to this,
· the girl's father, residing in Sussex, wriies (April 18, 1807)
d1at he knows Powell has " .a wife, now living and family.
Let them," he adds, "be your constant care; froubl~ your·
sdf no farther, in sendine: ·me old news of an unfortunate
Daughter." From anothtt letter it seems Powell applied to
this gentleman for money ; to which he rejoins, " All I ,
know of your .person, character, profession, or abilities, j5
that you sign your name Joseph Powell I and had your se.
ClOnd letter treated on the same aubjecl as the first, i. e. wish-
ing me to advance you money, Fortune•tell.ing, &c. you
would have \\'ailed a great wbile for an .answer. As for the
~real kindness y~u express my daughter has received from

· It 11 eV1dent, both from Powell's own letters and from the
Jq>lia made lo them, that be was very libcr:il towards the
young woman here alluded to, although she uneitpectedlv
,went away from him, and assodated with William M •• • • JI.
Powell, in a lcuer to her father, writes t&at he "treated bl:.:'
with every indulgence that a fond and tendt>r lhuiband ccmld

pears that the pcrs6n who ca~1sed her ~o go away was on t_hat ·

a father by her instead of a villain."
• There is reason, however, to doubt whether she was re-
stored to ~er part>nts, because .this same woman kept up a·
correspondence with P.owcll afterwards, and in several of her

Powt:ll seems to ha\•e si.lcce~dcd in decciying her back to him,
· and concerted measures for getting rid .of the INSANE WIPE,
not long before his apprehension on the 10th of October. . .
In one of his exculpntory (;pistles .to William M •. ; .,. JI,.
the prisoner ~pswers to 11 charge alledged agaimt him, of.

But it is time to drop the present subject, and proceed tG
another ; only first suggesting, that the original papers by
which these facts are proved, will be carefully preserved by
the Secretary of the " Society for the Suppression of Vice,"
ao that the authenticity of this statement may be fully vindi-·
cated. It has now been sufficiently ~vinced that the offender
is not entitled to that interference which was exerted in his
fiivour, prior to his final col}lmitment; and that the .Editor•
of d~fferent journals, who still continue to appear in his be~
half, must be considered as encouraging an offence, c~­
pletely substantiated .in a court of justice, and the ·direc'
tendency of wh_
ich is most injurious. to society!

, re"' penons ale .~ffieiently aware of the artifices ana false-
hoods by .which that ·class of intpc)stors, called Fortune-
tellers, are accustomed to dupe the credulous part of mM-
k~nd, and the banefql ·influence .which· these pretenders ex-
ercise upon the public moral~. They not only profess to
answer all ~rts of ridicµlo\_ls and uni~portant question~ ; but
mey so far impose on the lower·orders of the community, as
to make them believe lying predictions even upon subjeets
~ntimately connected with their personal conduct and welfare.
They not only flaitrr the harmless wishes and hopes of the
giddy or th~ young; ~ut pretend t~ foretel! th.e most.'wei~ht_y
events, and dare to pomt out t'he lme of hfe m which md1-
vidnals are likely to_gr.atif.y their peculiar taste. And the se•
cret manner in which these astrological deceivers· carry on
their ttaffic is; tO<? ·generally, such as to elude the notice and
det~tion ofcommo~ o_bse!""ers~ oi ~t leasto~ those who n_iore:
partacularly watch'over and ptot~t' 1he1pt1hh,c morals. · ·
It cannot be! denied, tbat the direct tenden£y of these 1:on-
sultations and answe.~s is to unsettle- the minds of the igno-
rant, arid to render them dissatisfied with their situatiou, by
opening to their'view·pi-ospects which never wilr be realized :
uay, they tend to weaken the ties or family attachment, and
reeoncile persoos to ·tile expected death of a ·parent, wfio
ought to have Leen regarded with filial affection! This will be ·
