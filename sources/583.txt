AS it is impossible for Man, even arrived
to an age of perfect reason, to recollect what·
bas passed in his infancy, so it' is impossible .
for any nation, though in the highest degree
of civilization, to know any thing certain of
their origin,
./
·However, the knowledge which is necessary.
for man to possess, and which, undoubtedly,
deserves his most particular care and attention,
is t~at of himself: yet, mankind, in the eyes
of t~e wise, &~eem divided into two parts; one
of unbelievers, endeavouring to darlren the.
light of truth; t4e ()ther1 eqJial)y weak in
mind, . searchipg for ~a~d de~ighting in idle
fables. SuGh is ~ur natural frailty, that we
make prooal>ility uncertain, a~d w011ld have
uncertainty probalrle.
We must not bound our C;ipa,

that we should daily contemplate and reflect
o~ them, to encrease our understanding, improve
our heart, mak~ wi!idoPl the iiacred rule of our
mind, that we may arrive ,at our short jour-
ney's end, worthy the. glorious an4 delightful ··~
rest,' reserved at his side for the virtuous.
,Ia aD a~s Men have proceeded differently._
in Qeareh of truth, and the knowledge of them-
selves; their idea:s were so very extravagant,
ad the v11rim1s opinions they have had, are
altogether so strnnge .to our more enlightened'·- .
minds, that we cannot view them without the
strongest emotio_ns, and the most indignant
surprize, at their uniting sueh savage errors and
gross ·ahs~rdities, with the superiority o(_the
learning·they pos8essed.
A person,. who can recal the ~cenes of
ancient days, will not traverse the hiland o£
Great Britain, which craft and superstition so
long_made the theatre of a cruel religion,
without feeling eager·curiosity, succeeded by a
kind of awful horror, in viewing those places,
where, in the gloori. of the thickest woods, the
Druids performed their tremendous rites, where
they erected their sanguinary . temples, and
bathed their altars with the blood of human
l'ictims.

The.· friend of mankind, having· viewed
with grief these barbarous customs, will rejoice
at finding that human fancies and irregular 1
passions are no longer the rule of the new
Order of the Druids, now flourishing~ in the
same parts, under more sound and wise laws.
The object of the fyllowing Work, is not to
.add new matter to the British History, but an
impartial relation of transactions curious and
entertaining, and to record to posterity this
part of our History, of late years so much neg-
lected; it is therefore presumed to be worthy
the ·attention of every Briton.

INTRODUCTION.
·As it will be necessary to give au expla·
nation of the Pillars, the Circle, and the
Serpe'llt; 'Ye chose rather to ~ive _
it by ":ay of
Introduction, than to break mto the roam de·
sign, by inserting it in the body of the work.
I. That the Setting up tif Pillars, was, ia
the ·original use and intention, innocent and
· pious, will appear in the course of this His-
tory, from unquesiionable authority. This will
justify the regard for these pieces of antiquity;
for such, particularly as remain in this king-
dom; and which were, without doubt, .raised
by Believers, and never desecrated by idolatrous
purposes. For when the Romans introduced
- their vanities, they brought with them the use
of covered temples; and_on the perversion o£
the iphabitants, these open places, in aU pro-
bability, were entirely neglected, if not _partly
demolished. They were to be destroyed m the ·
1 Land of Canaan, because they had been abus(d
there; but ·how far the Israelites were forbidden
'to set· u.P any mor~ will .best appear from t~
precept Itself: LeVIt. xxv1. 1. "Ye shall .nake
" you no idols nor graven images, neither shall
~'you put up any image of stone in your land,

an altar and twelve p1Hars" unto the true God.
So likewise, long after this prohibition, we are
told, ht Sam. vii. 12. " 'Samuel took a stone
" and set it up, and .called the name of it Ebe-
" nezer, saying, hitherto hath the Lord helped
" us;" and verse 12, " there built he ~· altar
unto the Lord;" and chap. x. 3. " Tllo!i shalt
" come to the Plain of Tabor, and jhaJ,}. n~eet

·· Here we find the very same o:een tempi~, wJtieh
the Patriarch Jacob had raised and consecrated,
resorted to, eve~ in, the time of Samuel, for
.J'eligious purposes.; though it is difficult to con,-
ceive how it should have escaped the ~buses of.

-natural emblems of the Divine.Person: tha.t
the solar body, before writing, could not b~
more properly represented· than by tb.e figure
of a Circle; by which me.ans it became the <¥·
tifioial or secondary emblem of the First Person,
and one so ~lain and inoffen~ive, that it was
scarcely possible to pervert it to the uses of
idolatry. A still fnrther,purpose in the sacre4
use of this figure will he found in the Work
itself. It was the only means which the[ couW .

F<!r., tj.p~m .this consideration, all imaginable
·,qbj~cticm .. to.. be formed against it must be
chiefly founded. - · ·
· ttl. This Serpent was the symbol of light
~nd wisdom, of'1ife and health, amongst the east..

:phrenicians, Egyptians, Grecians, and if we may
believe Joseph Acosta, even amongst the Per.u-
~ians '; and was thence in 1·eligious matters ap-
~lied to Him, whom they distinguished as the
Divine Light; the Wisdom of God; the Giver
of Life; and the S;lviour of Mankindl TO' this,
sev~ra,l . causes might concur ; 88; the annual
renovation of its youth .and beauty; its ·sinu-
osity, which.enabled it to put on various fo~;
the acuteness of vision, and the extraordinary
sagacity ascribed to it; its color, which is that
of vivid flame or burnished brass: and the
names which it bore. .
, its name of Seraph, particulady, is so ex-
pressive of that bla~e of brightness. which it
seemed to furnish when reflecting the splendor
of the suri-beams ; that it has been transferred
to .a superior order of angels, .and is once made
bs_
e of to denote even the glorious appearance of
the Cherubim.
A9otber name of it, Chevia or (:-
huia,
(though not found in the Bible, yet preserved
in the Syriac and Chaldee) has a near affinity

with that which Adam gave to the mother of
tnankind, calling her name Cheva, because
she was the mother of all living.
A fragment, written in the Phrenician
· tongue, has the word (Chuia) for this serpent,
with an eye to both these meanings, and ex·
plains the entire figure of Abiry. " Jupiter,
" (says the fragment) is a feigned sphere; from
" it is produced a serpent: the sphere shews
" the Divine Nature to be without be~nning .or
" end; the serpent his word, which ammates the
" world and makes it prolific; his wings, the ·
" Spirit of God, that by its motion gives life to
" the whole mundane system."
But the great reason, (for this includes the
reason of the name also) why they considered it
as an emblem of the solar light, and so as a
substituted one of the second person, was, its
extreme brightness and radiancy, and the very
glorious appearance which it made; for. it was
the serpent ofthe fiery.flying species; the same
sort that we read of in ·Isaiah, xxx. 6, and
which afflicted the Israelites in the wilderness,
theimageofone ofwhich was lifted up byMoses;
and how far that serpentine figure was an em·
blem of the Divine Light shall be next con·
sidered. ·
1 Numbers, xxi. 6th, 8th, and 9th verses.-
" And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the
" people. And the Lord said unto Moses, make
" thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole;
" and it shall come to pass, that'every one that
" is bitten, when he looketh upon it, ~hall live.
" And Moses inade a serpent of brass, &c."
The looking unto this figure was to give health
au<l salvation to the offending Israelites. And

" Jesus, the author and finisher of.our faith,
" who, for the· joy that w'as set before him,
" endured the c•oss." _Heb. xii. 2. But let us
see what the.ancient Jews, before our Saviour,
thought of it, and how Christ himself· applied
it.
The opinion of the ancient Jews, may be
seen in the Wisdom of Solomon, xvi. 5, 6, 7.
" For when the horrible fierceness ofbeasts came
" upon these and they perished with the stings
" of crooked serpent, thy wrath endured not
" for ever. But they were troubled for a small
" season, that they. might be admonished,
" having a sign of salvation to put them in
" remembrance of the commandintlnt of thy
" law. For he that turned himself towards it,
" was not ·saved by the things that he saw,
" but by Thee that art the Saviour of All."-
ls not this the very s~nse and language of the
Apostle ?.· They were not .sa':'ed by looking up
unto the serpent, as such, but by looking up
unto Jesus (in that symbol) who endured the
cross.
John, iii. 14, 15.-" As Moses lifted up the
" serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
" Son of Man be lifted up ; that whosoever be..
" ·lieveth in ·Him should not perish, but have
" everlasting life." The words are ofthemselvej,
plain and deciiive. .
A .very learned author is of opinion, that,
" in it, the presence, in the manner1
it was in
" the Cherubim, resided ; because it cured all
" who were bitten by those serpents, and looked
" upon it, as the real presence does those who
" look at Christ upon the cross. Isaiah, chap.
" vi. makes use of this name with the same re..
" presentation as the Cherabim had ; which

'' connects the Seraph, the emblem hung up in
" the wilderness, which cured those who were
"' biten and would look at it, 'and the .Seraph .
~' Christ, who, as all men have been bitteq,
H cures every one who would look at ·~~m upon
" the cross." Whatever may be thought oftlli!i
notion, (of the presence resident in the emblem)
'tis very probable, that the Israelites th.emselves
entertained the same: since we find th~tn bl.Jrn~
ing incense to it even in the days of Heze~iah.
· As for the supposed impropriety of it on
account of the curse denounced against the ser-
pent at the fall, it is sufficient te observe, 'that
" Christ redeemed us from·the curse ofthe hr\v,
" being made a curse for us ; for it is written,
" cursed is every one that hangeth ~n a tree.".;.

History of the Druids, 8(c.
The topographical and geographical part
of the history of this globe, is so obscure beyond
Noah and the flood, that it does not permit us
to know any thing concerning this famous isl3:nd,
before these epochas ; nor can we even conJeC-·
ture whether or no it was inhabited at that time;
though from the first chapte1.." of Genesis, the
world appears to have been extremely populous
.in its antediluvian ages.
It may rationally be concluded, from ·the
,~arious opinions of the best historians, that
this island received its first inhabitants, from
the eastern parts of the world, adjoining to the
place where Noah and his family came to settle
on the decrease of the waters. They seem to
}~ave proeeeded, gradually as they increased,
peopleing first a great part of Asia, as far as the
mountain .Taurus. At the extremity of this
high mountain, in that neck of ground; called
from th~nce, Tatirica Chersonesus, the offspring
of Magog settled, whence they were named
Magogrei; Scythre~ then·Cimmerii; afterwards,
by contraction, Cimbri and ·Cumeri, because
they lived there in a perpetual kind of winter.
These Cimbri, were a very valiant am{ war-
like nation. Tully writes of them, that it was
their delight to dte in battle, and that Qothing ·

The Phrenici~ns;, ahotlier n~tion of the. re-
motest antiquity, living near tbe most eastern
part of t~e Medit~rrarlean sea, .at Tyre and
Sidon, who were a peoJ.lle of great knowledge,
and traded in the .pri~itnre ages ofth.e w~rld, are

Vroin thes; Phreniciatts, is to be deduced,
the first antiquity of this nation, upon ac-
'tount of their voyages hither, which ,may be
proved by the autllority.of.th~ pest authors. ·
They first reached this Island, as may be
gathered by ancient histories, before the Trojan
\var, and long before the first c;>lympiad, (the
beginning of whicb, according to the Julian ac...
count, was anno 3938; from the year of the
\vorld, 3256; from the temple, &c. 263). Some
say, it was their famous Hercules, others Himil-
co, who was sent with a fleet, through the
straits, to discover the western seas.
The cause of making them so early mari-
ners, was not only through their ambition for
empire, and particular genius for navigation and
merchandize, but through the necessity of in-
venting the best and safest way of escaping the
hands of Joshua, who persecuted them wi~h an
army of Israelites; and after having made them-
selves masters of most part of th'e Land of Ca-
naanj droye them into a nooK. of the earth, too
small to contain so numerous a body; when
they put themselves into shipping, ~o seek their
fortunes in other parts of the world, of which
company, Britain received a considerable share.
This skil~ul, trading people, finding tl]ese
islanos abounded with tin and lead mines, called
tn'em Barat-anac, orBratanac, viz. a country of
tin; ahd Alben, changed atter, by the Greeks,
into Albion; which is now called England.-
'J;hey exported immense quantities ofmetals and
skins, which they exchanged with the inhabit-
:tnts for salt; earthen pots, and brazen ware.
The parts of the country they more particularly
traded with, Were the west coast of Cornwall,...

De'!'mshire, ~nd the S.cilly. Islands, taking no
notice of the northern ·}!arts.· They este~med
the Bratanacs, (whence 1s derived Bretannica,
Britannia, a~d then Britain) a .ver! considera-
~le part of the world, ·on account of the useful
·CQmmodities they aWordecJ them; and indeed
they proved a mine of gold, .in their hands. . . .
The utility of those excellent commodities .
they exported from this country, through tJie
Mediterranean Seas, to Greece; rendered the
Greek~ !erycurious after the sea!cb ofit ; but.the
PhremCians, to whom .that trade· had been a
peculiar monopoly, disposin~ of 'lead and tin,
to all .other nations,· at thelr own price$, .were
very eareful oot to let any otbe.
r know this
navigation. . . . .
' They had great markets, particularly at
.Narbo, which they ~ept well provided, for the
· great extent of theu trade by land, as well as
:to . conceal this treasure from. the world, being .
·exceedingly jealous, least the source and head
of their commerce should .be discovered, and
the busy .Grecians receive the same benefit.-
.~hey very earefully and studiously concealed it,
· ·for· many years from the Greeks and Romans,
who knew this country, onlybyreport. .STRABO,
in the third book of his.Geograpby, says, ":r~at
" a Roman vessel, havmg followed a Phremc1an
" merchant ship, that they might learn this
" traffic ofmerchandize ; the Phrenician master,
" from spiteful envy, ran his ship on pu;pose
" upon thesands, wherebyhe broughtthe Roman,
"who follolfed, into the same danger of <le-
" strtiction,, himself escaping the wreck. He
" afterwards received, out of the public tre~­
" snry, the worth of the commodities and wares
" he had lost; which .exa~ple was afterwards
Digitized by Google
19
" imitated by many others in the ·same occur-
'' rences/'
· In process of:time, the Phrerucian state
declined, the tradewas much neglected, and their
wars were unsuccessful; which obliged that long
fortunate people to give up their commerce and
intercourse with this nation. The Athenians
now took advantage of this, for~ being at
war with the Persians, whom they completely
defeated by sea, compelled them to take refuge ,
in the river Hurymedom, in Pamphylia; they
then dispatched their great Admiral Cimon, ·son
·of the brave Miltiades, with a considerable
number of gallies, well manned, to attack their
fleet, which he soon reached and overcame,
·taking &Orne and sinking others : on the same
-day, meeting accidentally with a fleet of Phre- ·
nicians, ·coming to the aid of the Persians, :with
.whom they were allied, be seized upon their
·navy, forsaken by the owners almost before he
could prepare for battle : and thus were the
Grecians peaceably left masters of the seas,
without any copartners in the profit and glory.
HaviQg now the most expert and able
· seamen, and exceeding every otller nation in the
number of her shipping, it will not be irrational
· to conclude from the following 'reasons: That,
· availing themselves of s9 many advantages, with
so favourable an opportunity, and having heard
of the Bratanna~s, .now learnt th~ way to them,
and came to Bntam to trade with them: 1st,.
froni their measuring all their actions by profit,
undertaking any voyage, howel"er long and te-
dious, if they could promise themselves to be

they first made their appearance fro!Jl the east..
.ern parts of the world, about the time of'Abra-
Jaam. Their name bespeaks them of Greek ex-
traction, although they were known here before
~he Greeks, but as it seems clearly denoted
.by their doctrine and religious customs, we
•re inclined to ·think they were Cimbri, Phre-
nicians, or ldumeans. The Cimbri, who called
-'the~Ives the sons of Hercules, were wont to
sacrifice men, particularly strangers; who fell
into their hands. · . · '
,.As in the ·British History there' are many
things altogether impossible, others very im-
probable and fabulous;. y~t, as there may be
many truths couched under the whole, we think
it nec8188ry to give a full account of this parti•
cular part of our hi&tory, partly upon that very
reaso~, .and partly because many judicious au-
thors do not deny them. ·
. . ·The an£ient Druids were ge~erally t~ought
. to be the second Order known m Br1tam and
Gaul; but it is nece~sary we should speakofthe
. first, from, which they we~e derived.
.. . The most ancient ·Order- of people in Bri-
. tain, is that of ·the ·Bardi, .thougli in time the
. Druids obtained ·a· superi.ority ovet: ·thel_ll, in
. point of esteem. ; The Bardi were, (according
. t~ S~RABO) JlOets an4 ~ongsters ; singing in re-
: cttatlv.emus1c, the pr.ilses ofgreat men.- Others
. way, they derived their· name ·and· origin from
Bardus, - called the King ·of 'the Celts, son of
. Dmis, one :of' the most ancient kings of the
Gauls, from whom they also pretend the Druids
.to have been named. · -
· These .Banli or Bards were, no doubt, at
first ofa·religious:order, and employed them-
~lves in deifying.great men, composing verses
Digitized by Google
. and singing .them, ·while playing upon their
Nablium or Cynira; also in praise of heroes, at
.their apotheosis, wbic~ in ancient times was
not only esteemed glonous for the dead, and
.useful to the livi~g, but also.a religious an~ ac-
ceptable act to the Gods. · · · . ,
This custom originated in the east, where
.it was practised from the earliest. period. n
was communicated to the Greeks, and after-
wards to the Latins. The ancient Greeks had
'not .only the whoie body of their Divinity in
.verse, but upon· all occasions, as marriages,
funerals, &c. their religious rites and cere-
monies were performed in it ; likewise upon
occasion· of some great deliverance or ·re-
markable victory, they sang the praises .of
their gods, composing odes and hymns, · which.
th~y rehearsed to the people, in a solemn man-
ner, .with music.
. The Bards were also .very much given ~o
·eomposing genealogies, ·and rehearsing.them ia
public assemblies, in which they were very
skilful. The profession of a Bard required more
that ordinary abilities. ~ and were the prieSts of
·those days. HoMER mentions Demodocus. and
Veisses, as celebrated Bards.
. . The Ba~ds, who-hitherto were t~ only re-.
IIgious Order, and whose compositions were·
·us.
ed i.n the .most solemn rites, degenerated
by degrees, into the nature of common ballad-
makers, and from singing ofthe essence and im-
mo-rtality of the soul, the. works of nature, the
. courseofcrelestial bodies, the order =t.nd harmony
of the sp~er.es, the praises of the Gods, · and

n.way in writing ; and a trust was reposed in
some particular persons, who by their singular
iotegrity and long experience of fidelity and
leaming, were cl1osen for tha't purpose.
· They committed nothing to public writing.
Pisistratus was the first person that exposed to
publicview, books of the liberal arts and sciences
at Athens; and the way of composing in num-
bers was left off in Greece a little before the.
day of Herodotu~, who, notwithstanding, en-
titled his books by the names of the Muses.
The first establishment of christian religion,
by public authority, is very early, being 181
years .after the death of Christ. The reason
why iv was so early known in Britain, above
other nations, was because ofthe learning, piety7·
and devotion of the Druids; for many of the
tenets, ·of which the immortality of the soul
was the .chief, were great inlets to their religion,
which, besides the great virtue and holines~ it
car-ried with it, taught rewards of virtue and
punishments of vice, upon safer grounds thaq.

Britain .'was_divided. into sev(;lral petty: go..
\ 1ernments, as to civil'affairs; Kent alone having
four distinct kingdoms witliin it; the govern"!
nicnt of the Druids wa&·universal over the whole
i&land; and'some part of Gallia a~so; ,so that
their power and int~rest was infinitely the
greater, being_subject only to two Primates;
whereof one presided over the. North ·Druids;
the other over the South. The former of which·

that, though the secular power might often cla~h~
by reason of its many decisions, by being di-
vided in many kingdoms, the interest and au-
thority of the :pruids was preserved entire, by
their unity .under one head, to whom, once a
year, th'ey had rec~urse in public meetings and1
aSS"emblies ; which. custom they .received from
the Bardi, \vho had it from the Phcenician~.

in a manner distinct from the civil government,"'

many others in the neighbourhood h~d relatio•
to the religious ceremonies performed by the
Druids thereabout. On the west side of S"Qtton-
Coldfield runs a very high hill, almost. dire~tl;r
north and south. At the north end lies tb'e vii~
lage of Aldridge, and the south end is Barr,'a.
village belonging to it. Under this hill, on th~
north-east side, arise many springs, which run
into one body ~ailed :6owen-pool : hence a broatf.
of the same name runs by Aston and Shenstone
to Hints a~d Tamworth ; there joi~s the Trent~
and runs duect to Hull. Near Aldndge, a sm~l
.common, to this day, retains the name of Druid~
heath; and near to the pool, at the east end, is'
small area or parcel of ground, about 8() yards by
30, encoin;passed with a treble ditch. Tnis'being
much too small for a great nu,mber uf men, or
an army; must therefore have been the s~at of
some public ·or private family. About two or
three hundred yards towards the south is a hill
exact~Y. round, encompassed with a. single ditch_,
and rtsmg from .the level of the ground about '
or 8 feet : the dia111eter is about 6 yards. It has
never been ploughed ; but what the ~se. of i~

than others, upon all the acc~mnts aforesaid :

· PLINY, who mentions this herb, _
does not
tell us what it was ; but it seems very probable;
that, from the last ceremony, namely, gathering
it with the left hand, the herb took its name,
that'is to say, Samol, signifying in the Phreniciart
longue the left harid. This herb, so gathered; .
was eateemed of sovereign virtue in tlie cure of
all diseases in swine or other cattle.
_ The high antiquity and universality of sa•
~rifices, bespeak it originallY. a aivine institu-
tion. There is great probability that the clotfi.:.

Of this most solemn act of religion we

The practice of th~se public office~ of reli... ·

made holy by the Creator from the begmnmg ;
1he use of altars, and the early foundation of
temples. -
Accordingll, we read that Noah (by whom
.the true worship was preserved) immediate}!

took of every clean beast, ~!'d of every clean
/owl, and offered .btirnt-Qffermgs on the altar.
So Abra~am built an altar unto Jehovah, who
a peare unto him. Again, the same Father oC
t£e Fait 1ful built an altar unto Jehovah, and
invoked in the name Jehovah. So likewise,
lsaac ~uilt ail altar, and invoked in the name
Jehov(lh. . ·· . ·
'Vhere these altars were placed there was
said to be, in those early ages of the world, a ,
house or temple of Jehovah, which were mostly
upon eminences, and always untovered ; and,
where they could be had, upri~ht stones were
erected near them. This in scnpture is called,
selling up a pillar: nor was it done without a
partic!llar fortn of c~nsecrati~m, of which the
behaviour of Jacob Will explam the whole.
'' And Jacob rose up early in the morning;
" and took the stone that he had put for his pil-
" low, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
" upon the top of It. And he called the name
" of that place Bethel, or the House of God.
"And Jacob vowed a ,·ow, saying, if God wi11
" be with me, and will keep me in this way that
'' I go, and will give me bread to eat and rai-
" ment to put on, so that I come again to my
"' father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be
" my God. And this stqne, which I have set up
" for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all
4 ' that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the
" tenth unto ·thee." In consequence of this,
he "built there an altar,. and called the place ·
" El-beth-El; and set up a pillar in the place
" where God talked with him, even a pillar of
" stone ; and he poured a drink-offering thereon,
" and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called
4 ' the name of the place Bethel." Here was a

which undoubtedly were made many additions~
as it became very famous : for hence was the name
Bethylia given afterwards to such like t~mples.
So Hkewise we are told that Moses rose up
early iri the morning, and built an altar under
the hill, and twelve pillars. .
._ At other times the altars were inclosed by .
groves of trees. Thus Abraham is said to have
planted a grove in Beersheba, and to have in-
voked there in the name Jehovah. ·
As the Divine Presence,·inhabiting the Che·
· rubim on the east of Paradise, was signified by
that irradiation of glory, ,which in our transla-
tion is called a flaming sword turning every wa9,
and which directed mankind in the first ages to
the place and object of religious worship, ; so
these groves and stones were· made to surround.
the altars in cj.rcular order, as best expressive of
tile same irradiation, and distinguishing such
places as set apart for the public worship of th~
same -God, who was ~tupposed also to be there
.especially present ; and whose infinity was like-
Wise by the same figure acknowledged and in-
tended. But where this symbol, expressive of
the Divinity, was complex, then the circle w~
particularly applied to distinguish the person of
the Father, being the ·figure of the solar body,
which was considered as his great natural em~
blem.

more, their own relatives, fathers, and mothers,
the new-born fruits of their acCidentaf~onnec­
tions, and those too after the times of lawful
matrimony, they offered their jtnagip~ry propi- .
tious or unfavpura~l~ g$>ds. ·Con~erniqg the

Digitized by Google
,..nd sacrificed upon t~e. summits of the highest
.mountains. This ..~!loll'~ ~stom is also !l'ttested
'in innumerable .pmces of the sacred Scnptures :
Abraham was commanded by God to offer Isaac
his son fc~· a burnt-offering upon one of the
~ountains in the land of Moriah. In later ages,
.when temples were used, they were often built
.upon the summits ofmountains; very high moun-
tains being commonly held sacred to Saturn or
Jupiter, and sometimes to Apollo. But, as it
has been before mentioned, groves oftrees, woods,
and shady places;were most looked for, preferred,
and reverenced; nay, it was so·common to ~rect
altars and temples in groves, and to ded1cate
them to religious uses, that all sacred places,
even those where no trees were, were called·
groves.
· It seems to have been a custom, which pre•
yailed not only in Europe, but over all the eas-
tern countries, to at.tribute a 89Ft of religion to
grc;,ves .: hence, among othel' precepts, whet'eby
the Jews were kept from the imitation of the
p;p.gan r~ligion, this was on~: " tlunt sluxlt not
plant thee a grove of an!/ trees 11.ear U1l.to the altar
ofthe Lord tlt!J God.:' Several causes are assign-
ed why gr.ov«1~ pa111-e 1,.to S() general request. As,
nrst, t.he pleasantness qt ~uc4 places was apt to
~llure the people, and to beget in them a love
for the religious worship ·paid tl!ere ; .especially
in hot' countries, where nothing is more delight-
rul and refreshing than cool shades ; for which.
cause the sacred groves consisted of tall and ~.
be~utiful trees, rathe~ than such as yielded fruit.
Secondly, The sohtude of groves was thought
very fit to create a religious awe and reverence
in the J;D.inds of the people. Thus we are told
by PLINY, that, i~ groves, the very silenee o£ th4t

.plftCe bepomes the object-of our adoration. SE-
NECA also.()bserves, that when we come into such
:Pla<;es, the height .of the trees, the solitude and
secrecy of the place, and the horror which the
shades impress upon us, possesses us with an opi-
nion that some deity inhabits there. .
Thirdly, Some are ~opinion that groves
derived thei.r religion from the primitive ages of
.~en, who lived in s~ch places before the build-
mg of houses ; and who had no other defenc.e
for their infants against wild beasts, or the wea-
.ther, than wliat was afforded by boughs of trees
compacted together ; which was derived from
Paradise, the seat of the first ·parents of man-
~~. i
· · Groves held as the peculiar residence of the
deity, were ornamented with a variety of offer-
·ings, excluding almost entirely the light of the
sun ; which were deemed most sacred, and as
such carefully preserved pUTe ·and uninjure~;
sacrilege being punished with horrid, protracted
torments, ending in death.
The Druids batt all these custoJils among
them still more refi~ed, and no less cruel; and,
indeed, death must have been looked upon by
them as very little pain, since thay used to in-
flict that punishment upon him wh9, in their
,general assemblies, came the last, tQ oblige the
rest to be more attentive.
They held an opinion, that the life of·a man,
:either in a desperate sickness, or if~ danger of
.war, could not be secured unless another suffered
in his ~tead ; so ·that in. such cases they either
·offered men in sacrifice, or vowed so to do after
their delivery; which vows they were obliged
to perform.

flames :-the strangeness of whic'h cust~m w~

_This ceremony of sacnficmg men to thetr
idols in a wicker image, strange as it was, was
not begun by chance, but upon some great occa- '
sion ; and something· extraordinary appear.s in
the magnitude of the statue itself: they might
do it in remembrance of Jupiter's victories over
the titans and giants. · _

but very often of men ; and this represented
the occasion of the,solemnity ; a custom not left
()ft' at this day, as ·sometimes by burning the
etligy, of ~ person, either to his honour, or in
deifying him, or else in public detestation of
some high and notorious crime and misdemeanor.
Sometimes they burnt living persons themselves,
(even (or pleas'!Jre~ on their public feast days) to
the honour of their gods, and the mirth and
jovialty o(their barbarous spectators. Thus Nero
wrapt the Christians in hemp and p'itch, and
made them serve as torches to his theatre; i"n
contempt (as some write) of tliat saying, Ye arw
Ike lig~ts of file 'World.
Many :persons are of opinion, that th.e reli-
gious principles of the Druids were similar to
those of the Gymnosophists and B"rahm.ans of
·India, the Magi of Persia, and the Chaldeans.of
Assyria, and therefore to have the same origin ;
which opinion appears well grounded, and cre-
dited by the learned of several countries.
The Gymnosophists were philosophers who
went naked, and lived solitary and austere lives,
in caves, woods, and desarts, feeding on .herbs.
am\ for a time abstaining from carnal pleasures.
They were abo called Brahmans or Bramins, of
Brachman or Bramba, the prescriber of their
rights or laws. They were very learned men,
held in great reverence by the_people, and had
a strong idea of the Trinity, theu opinion being,
that the god Achari or Wistan created the world
by the administration of three perfect beings,
whom he had first made for that design : these
three are, 1st, Bramba, (viz. Penetration) by
this he created the universe :- .
. 2d, Breschen, (viz. existing in all things};
b.y this he preserv~s it :-
Digitized by Google
. ·~d, Mahaddia, (viz. the great Lord); by-
this he will destroy it.
They preterid to have received four books
from Bramba, in which books all khowledge is
comprehended; they acknowledge the metainpsy-
tihosis, br transmigration of souls, throug-h seve-
ral human bodies and beasts, before they can
~rrive. at p~easure and being purely spir.itual !
~nd for th1s reason they teach, that 1t 1s not
lawful to kill, or eat any thing that is kiJled,
and none of tl;teir tribes do .eat any; but theit
soldiers. They also hold the flesh of cows and
peacocks as sacred, and therefore they abstain
from it ; and build hospitals for lame and de-
cayed beasts, and btiy birds of the Mahometans
·to set them at liberty. By their austere Jives,
.great fastings, te~chin~ the peopl~, ~nd expound-
ing the mystenes Of theu rehg10n to them,
they have obtained a very great a\ve ov~r the
people in the Indies, •and e~peci-ally upon. the
Malabar coasts : and the bniles are committed
to the Bramins, to he blessed by them, that the
marriage may be happy. ·
Now the Druids held the metampsychosis,'
though they destroyed so many human and ani.;
inal beings ; and they thought it was not lawful
to eat ducks or hens, and many other winged
.animals. They, like the other priests just men-
tioned, kept many of their opinions secret, and
taught the others publicly. Whatever opinionH
·they privately entertained, in pub1ic they wor-
shipped a multiplicity of deities.· · ··
Many of their mysteries, it is said, are con-
tained in the Hebrew word Eloltim, which im-
plies very different meanings. Mr. HuTCHINSON'
says it signif;ies :strength, 'power, and the Cove-
nants, or ever-blessed Trinity, being one God,

JEHOVAU. From that word they think it
plain, that not only their kind of worship ill
wood¥ and groves was at first derived, but that
t)le w_
hole of the ·Trinity is deducible from a
right qnderstanding of it. . .
· They had also different manners of wor-
shipping their various .deities, and a particu..
lar sacrifice for every one. Th.e names of their
chief gods were, Ju_piter, Tutates, and Hesus, to
whom they offered most of their human vic-
tims. .
The u~age of performing alltheir act~ ofwor-
ship in the open air or uncovered te~ples, comes
from _their opinion that it derogated. from the
greatness of the gods to confine them within
close places, or.to assimulate them to any huma•
form.
Tlwre is no doubt but they had the same
gods. as 'the Gauls, and agreed with them i~
their manner of worship : neither indeed could
it be otherwise~ if we consider what care they
took to preserve the unitr. of religion, and the
exact observances of theu order : for besid~
the yearly synods held: in the isles of Anglesey
and Man, under their Primat~ or ,Arch-:Druid,
they had a solemn an4\ general sessions, in a
field set apart for t}lat. purpose,· near Drew, in
Pays Chartrin, the chief residence of the Arch.-
Druid of Gaul, who had in the neighbourhoo~
another palace among woods. .
To this great assembly resorted the Druid,s
from all 'parts, to hear causes, and to consult
about the affairs of religion, in which consul-
tation the British Druids, it is said, carried the
most eminent authority ; they also agreed upoD
the number of their god~, and the particular
honors due to them : they iruttituted publi~

that the day might be celebrated uniformly
through all their jurisdictions. .
Thoogh they had a iixed number of gods,
yet.in many particular places, the people had
private and tutelar gods, whose denominations
extended not beyond a hill, ri'ver, fountain, or
spring. · ·
Jupiter was worshipped under many names~
and indeed, as VARR.o says, we read of above
300 Jupiter!.!, and each nati<m seems to have had
one peculiar to itself. He who was worshipped
in Britain, was, without any doubt, the Jove of
the eastern nations, finding his names and wor-
ship the same exactly as in these western parts.
. He was particularly called Taramis, viz.
Thunderer ; and Thor, in the north, which
aame sigilifies also Thunder ; .and from which
is derived Thursday, viz. the day of Thor, be-
~ause that day out of the seven in .the week was
coasecrated to him. The Swedes, Germans, and
Saxons, worshipped him in the same manner as
the Britons and Gauls ; we therefore rieed but
relate the divine hoDors paid to him in our
island. · ·
He ltas looked upOn as the cause of life
-source of enlivening fire-father of gods and
meb 1 called, the omnipotent-the first and the
last-the head and the middle-the giver of all
things-the foundation of the earth and starry
he'avens-and he was believed to be both male
and female, and immortal.
· He waS' held to rtile and govern the air ;
they thought that from him proceeded thunder
and lightning, winds and storms-that he gave
fair weather, and brought forward the fruits of
the earth. 'the Phrenician~.; called him Moloch;

it is observable~ t}:lat as the C~na~nites (of whi~~
country Phrenicia was .a part) offered human
sacrifices to that.god, so likew.isc did the Gauls
and Britons to their Taramis or Tbunderer.
· The Canaanites, the Egyptians, the inhabi·
tants of Palestine, and many• other people~
offered their own children unto ..im; and the
Jsraelites ·themselves imitated their barbaritie!'.
They caused their children to pass between hl'Q
fires, till they were miser~bly scorched : they
also s~ut them up in a hollow idol of brass;
representing Moloch, made red hot; and while
these innocent victims were in this manner tor~
n1ented, they sounded trumpets, beat drums,
&c. to drown their cries. . · ·
lJpon the altars .·erected in honour of Jnpi..
ter, th"'' Briti~th blood .was often poured out in
great ,abundance ; but ·perhaps more in Gaul,
because that country being more infected witt,.

oftener atoned that .power under whose ~land
they lay, than .the Britons, whq enjoyed a more
temperate and serene air.

Description l!f the Dntidical Temples, o/c.
Near the Main Ambr~, at Penzance, is a
famous patriarchal temple, .called Biscawoon,
consisting of 19 pillars in a circle and a centra~
Kebla : the entrance composed of two largef,"
f)tones than the rest.
Thes~ patriarchal or druidical temples were
laid out in such figures as wer~ hieroglyphicaJ,-
and intended to describe the nature of the Di-
:vi.J1ity; as the Circle, .such is ~hat of Stonehenge;
or the Circl.e an~ ~eraph, pr winged Se.-pent, as
that of Abirv.
· Th~t the temples of this sort which we hav~
~mongst us were really founded by the peopltp
to whom they are now ascribed, will be further
evident from a consideration of the works them...

. Abiry is founded on the more elevated part
of a plain, whence is an almost imperceptible
descent every way. The entire figure of it, is a
Seraph or winged Serpent transmitted through
a eircle. The ·outer part of the grand circle is
avast and lofty vallum, with a very deep ditch
·on the inside of it, near 80 feet or 45 cubits
broad. Its diameter 750 cubits; its circum~
ference 2250 cubits ; the inclosed area about 22
acres.
Within this ditch was formed a circle of
100 enormous stones &et upright; which were
generally 15, 16, or 17 feet high, al'ld near as
much in breadth. Twenty-five cubits ·is the
regulat measure with regard to the larger stones
from the centre of the one to the centre of the
other,. making the interval 15 cubits. But in
all of them throughout, the proportion of the
.,lid to the void is as 2 to 3. Out of these 100
stones 44 were still visible when Dr. STUKELEY
was there in the year 1722; whereof 17 were
standing and 27 thrown down or reclining: Ten
of the remainder had been demolished by ToM
RoBINSON in the year 1700, and their places
levelled. The vestigia of the rest were still
discernible. When this mighty colonade of 100
such stones was in perfection, there must have
been a most agreeable walk between them and
the ditch. It is scarcelyjossible fot us to form
a notion of the grand an beautiful appearance
it must then have made.
Within this circle were the Wings, being
two temples of like form and dimensions ; each
<!onsisting of two concentric circles. The outer
eircles contain each 30 stones of like dimen-
sions and placed at like ·intervals with those
already mentioned-
. ·Th.e inner circles of both
Digitized by Google
·~OilSist each of 12 stones of the same-size and di.&-
tances. The inner cirde must therefore be 100
cubits in diameter ; the outer 250 cubits. Sq
that the Periphery of the outer circles of the
wings is equal to th~ di~meter of the ,great cir-
cle. ,
The soutbermost of these temples bas a cen•
tral obelisk which was . the Kibla whereto they
turned their faces in worship. The other ha$
that immense work in the centre, which the He-
brews or Phamicians called ·Kobke, and from
them ·the Old Britons a Cove : consisting of
three stones placed with an obtuse·angle towards :
each other, and as it were upon an arc of a cir;.
de, like the great half round at the east end of
sOme cathedrals. It was the AdytuJD of this tem-
ple and the Kibla thereof, opening nortlt.east :
the extrav~ant magnitude and majetity of which
is very astonishing. It measures 20 cubits front
the edge of the outer jambs, and 10 cubits in
depth. · Upon the ground before this superb
nitch lay the altar, which no doubt was carried
off long ago, as not being fixed ; and the north~
em pillar.is also gone : it fell down in the yea.a-
171~. Its lepgth was seve:q. yards, of. the same
shape with its opposite, tall and narrow. Thi$
m~asured 17 feet ·above ground, being ·10 whole
cubits ; 4 cabits broad, and 1 cubit and.a, half
thick. Such were the Ansre or wings of thiJ
noble ellipsis. That in the middle is 9 cubits
broad, as many high, and 2 cubits a:q.d a half
,thick. Of the e~terior circle of this northern
telllple, ~ut three are now left standing, and six
more lymg on the ground. In 1720, .both cirl"'
cles were standing .and almost entire. About
that time several stones of the southerD temple
were ~estroyed; but 14 are still left, whereof
Digitized by Google
56
about halfare standing. The ce~trai obeli~k of
this temple is circ~lar at the base ; 'of a vast
bulk, bemg 12 cubits long, and 5 cubits itr dia~
meter ; and standing higher than the rest'. For~
merly it was tile altar of this temple. Most of
the houses, walls, and outhouses of this town are
built with the materials of these stone's that have
been fired and broken. ·trnder an·a~h tree dug
here was found one of the Druids axes 6r ~elts;
wherewith they cut the misleto-e of the oak.'
·Let us walk out now by the southern en"'
ttahce of the town, passing the vallum : the .
road straight forward leads to Kennet and Over.i
ton. . This is the Via sacra, being an avei)Ue up
to the temple, and forming besides .one half of
the .bodl of t~e Seraph. .T.his was. more than
an Engbsh mde, and set with stones on botll
sides opposite to one another and at regular dis~ ·
tances. As this was to be the picture of ail ani.a.
mal, the Druids followed nature's drawing as
nearly as possible, making the avenue narrower '
towards the neck than at its middle. The whole
length of it consists of 100 stones on eac~ side,
reaching from the vallum of Abiry town to the
circular work upon Overton Hill. The same
proportion is every where preserved between
breadth and interval as before. Mounting up
Overton Hill, the avenue grows much narrower.
In 1722 the number of stones left were 72.
In a field on the left band, or east of the
avenue, not far from Abiry town, is a pentagonal
stone laid ftat . on the ground, in the middle
of which is a bason always full, and never
overflowing, much regarded by the country peo•
pie, and proceeding from a spring underneath ;
which may have been here from the foundatioa
of the temple, for purifications.

The summit Qf Overton HiU is the Hak-peni
(a compound oriental word signifying the ser- .
pent's head), which is 4000 cubits from the val-
lorn of Abiry. This hill the people have a high
notion of, and still call it the sanctuary. Unfortu:.
natelv .
all the stones ha-re been removed, and the
gromid ploughed up. · The stones here were not
large, but set pretty close together ; and the
proportions of them with the intervals and be-
tween the two circles, ·an ta~en at one· view,
charmed the spectator. · Many people here re-
member- both circles entire and standing, two
· or three fallen stones excepted, and they are
.,• still talked of with great pleasure and .regret
The outer circle consisted of 40 stones,. and the
inner of 18, somewhat larger than the others.
From Overton Hill is a most pleasing prospect,
overlooking the whole extent of the temple and
sacred field, and beyond that into Glocestershir~
and Somersetshire. . ·
· \\'e now proceed to Bekhampton Avenue,
which extends also 4000 cubits, or an eastern
mile from Abiry towards Bekhampton. It is the
_hinder part of the hieroglyphic Seraph, which
the Druids thus pourtrayed in _
this most por-.
tentous size ; and the number .of the stones, ·aH
of the other, was 100 on each side; but almost
·all of -them have been destroyed and carried
away. Yet the unwearied jndustry of Dr.
STUKELflY ha.S traced out the Obit of every
stone. It goes out of Abiry westward at the
interval of 25 stones, or a quadrant of the great
circle at Kennet Avenue, ~nd proceeds by the
south side of the ..~hy~:ch~y.al·d.. A little_spring
rises at Horslip nortl}-west, and flows thence to
Silbury Hill, where if! the -proper head .of 'the

. We shall now proceed to Stonehenge, which
is not erected upon the very summit of a hill,
but pret.ty near; and for more than three quar-
ters of the circuit you ascend to it very gently
from lower ground ; but from the north the
ascent is quicker. It is composed of two _cir-
cles and two o.vals respectively concentric. And.
the greatness of the lights and shades, a9 well
·' as their variety arising frQ,lll the cii'cular figure,
gives it all possible .advantage. The whole is
inclosed by .a circular ditch, origirially 30 cu-
bit~ broad, but now levelled very much. , The
distance between the verge of the ditch on t~e _
inside, quite round, to the work of the temple,
is equal to the diameter of the temple itself,
viz. 60 cubits : so that the entire diameter from
the outer verge of the ditch is fUO cubits.
When you enter the building and cast your
eyes around upon the yawning ruins, you are
/ stmck into an extatic reverie, which none can
describe, and they only can be ·sensible of t_
hat
feel it. · Other buildings fall by piecemeal, but
here a single stone is a ruin. Yet is there as
much of it .left undemolished, as enables us l'ery
sufficiently to recover its pristine form. The
best face of the stone is set inward; and those
that had the best outward face, toward the front
I... ._
or entrance. . ·
The intention of the founders was this : the
whole outer circle was to consist of 30 upright
stones ; each stone was to be 4 cubits broad ;
each interval 2 cubits. But the grand aperture
is 2 cubits and a half wide : this crouds the
next intervals on each side a little nearer ; the
rest preserving their true distance throughout.
Upon the top of these 30 uprights were

I
61
ttlac~ an equal number ofimposts, :~.ecured with
mortise and tenon, in such a manner that the
whole circle ·is "linked together in a continued
corona, by the imposts or cornice bc:ing carried
· quite round. The centres of the tenons are two
cubits distant from each other upon each upright
and fit the mortises very aptly. They are
rather a semi~val than a hemisphere. The
heigh~ of upright and impost is 10 cubits and a
haJt', of which the upright is nine; so tbat the
impost is a sixth part of the_ height of the
uptight: but as the entrance is wider~ so the
·impost over it is thicker than the rest to secure
it from breaking. If we measure. on the outside
-the collective breadth of two uprights and the
intetva~etween them, it is 10 cubits and a half~
equal to\the whole height. The interval is half
the brciJth of a· stone ; and the thickness of a
stone jS half its breadth. . .
/)f the uprights there are 17 yet standin~
l 1 of which remain contiguous to the grand
entrance, with 5 imposts upon them. One t1p-
right more, at the back of tl1e temple or on the
south-west, leans upon a stone of the inne1· cir-
cle. There are six more lying opon the ground,
whole or in pieces ; so that 24 out of30 are still
visible at the place. There is but one impost
more in its proper place, and ifut two lying on
the ground; so that 22 are carried off.
Through the middle of the principal en-
trance runs the principal line of the whole work,·
the diameter from north-east to south-west.
This line cuts the middle of the altar, the length
of the Adytum or cell, the entrance into the
,court, and so runs down the middle of the
avenue to the bottom of the valley for almost
2000 feet. This is very apparent at first bight.

lJ~ this line are all the priooipaf centres that
.~ompose the work : it varies a little from true
tlorth-east. .
· Five cubits iaward from the inside of this
exterior circle, is another of much smaller
stones. A radius of 23 cubits strikes the inner
~rcumferenee; of 24 the outer. The stones
that composed it were 40 in number ; formint
with the outer circle.a very noble and delightful
walk, 300 feet in circuit. They are a cubit
thick and 4 cubits and a ha:lf high. Tlris was
their. stated ptoportion, being every way tht
half of the outer uprights. Such seems t~ ~ave
been the•riginal purpose ofthe (ounders; though
.in some places the stones are broader l!han the

~arce any G( these ent~re as t.o all their ·dhnen-
.Sions. The central d1tstance of · these st-ones_
measured upon tb.eir outer circumfet-en.te, 'is

Tlfildoon&, being made e~h of two uprights'

struction of this oyal is, that the twa hithermost
Trilithons corresponding, (viz. next the grand
entrance on the right hand and on the left), are
e~ceeded in height . by the two next in order,
and ~hose by tb.e Tri.litho~ . behind the altar ;
· thus 1mprovmg m he1ght and beauty from the
lower: to the upper end of the choir. Hence
their respective heights are 13, 14, an9 15 cu-
l>its. .
The stones of the interior oval are placed
2 cubits from the other. They were 19 in num-
l>er, at about ·the central distance of 3 cubits:
ea~h stone being a cubit and a' half broad, and
the interval the same. Their height is unequal,
like that of the Trilithons, rising higher towards
the. upper end of the Adytum : at a medium, it
is 8 feet, or 4 cubits. and 4 palms. From the
ruins of those left, we may well suppose that
_ the first next the entrance and lowest were ·
4 c~bits high ; an~ the n.ost ~dvanced hei~bt.
behmd the altar mtght be 5 cubits, and perhaps
more. These stones are in form Somewhat like.
an Egyptian obelisk, tapering a little upwards.
They are much harder than the re~t, as are the
stones in the lesser circle before de~tcribed; so that
what is wanting in bulk is compensated in soli-
dity. Of these there are-only six remaining~­
right : the stumps of two are left on the south
side by the altar~ one lies behind the altar, dug
up, or· thrown down by the. fall of the upright
therf'. One or two were thrown down pre>bably
by the fall of the upright of ti!e first Trilithen
on the right h~nd: ·and' the stump of another
remains by the upright there, still standing.
The altar is of a .blue, c()arse, and firm mar-
ble, ·as designed to resist fire, placed a little

four feet broad, 16 feet long, and iO inches thick;
leaving round it room sufficient for the minis,;,
tration of the priehts.
The whole number of stones of which this
most superb temple was composed, ih 140.
It has already been observed that the ave-
nue of the temple runs in a line north-eastward
from the grand entrance. It is inclosed all the
way by two parrallel ditches, the earth and turf
of which was thrown inward, and the avenue by
that means raised above the common level of the
p.ain. The breadth of it from ditch to ditch is
40 cubits : from the entrance of the area to the
valley beneath is just 1000 cubits. Thence it
divides into two branches: the right-hand branch
winding till it shoots directly east, towards an
ancient ford of the river; called Radfin Ford;
the left-hand branch goes oft' with a similar
sweep at first, but does not throw itself into a
direct line, as the other, but continues curving
to the left .along the bottom of the hill, till it
loses itself in the Course or Hippodrome.
This Course or Hippodrome is also inclosed
between two ditches, 200 cubits asunder ; the
earth of which was also thrown inward and the
turf raised. It is two English miles, or 6000
cubits in length, and has two opposite en-
entrances. It lies directly north from Stone-
henge, at the distance of about half a mile, and
is drawn due east and west, a small variation
excepted. The w~st end of it, towards which
are many considerable barrows, is. curved into
an arch, for the convenience of turning the con-
tending chariots. Its eastern termination is shut
up with a long bank or huge mole of earth,

Religiously disposed persons .are generally de-
-sirous of being interred near the places of reli-
.giomi worship ; which is an expression of their
assent to that worship, and of their confidence
in the object of it. But what relation to Stone-
henge lmve the barrows thrown up about War-
minster, at the distance of fifteen or twenty
miles ? And what those which are far on ·the
'Other side the river by Everley-and Collinbourne,
.and even in the valley about Tottenham, at a
ocoo&iderable distance from the plain itself?
To the meeting of great assemblies, whethe.r
'on religious or civil accounts, the· place seems
peculiarly adapted ;,for which purpose the wo'rld
-does not afford a nobler spot. Its situation is
upon a hill, in the midst of an extended plain
100 miles in circuit, in the-centre of the southern
part of the kingdom, covered with .numberless
-flocks of herds and -sheep, in which respect the
..e~ployment and the :pla~ns themselves are__pa-
:tnarchal; where the au 1~ perfectly sa:lub.:Jous

Wandsdyke and the mother ehur-ch of Abuy.
