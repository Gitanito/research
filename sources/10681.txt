  		              		Experience Description   

    I am a retired family physician. On July 10, I was the victim of Covid-19, and had high fevers at home for five days. My breathing became labored and when my pulse was dropped into the 70s when they should have been in the 93 percent or better. At that point I was transferred by the emergency medical service to a hospital in a different city. I didn't know if I would see my husband or family again because they didn't let visitors into the Covid wards of the hospital. I was placed in the ICU for Covid patients. Things got progressively worse over the next couple of days. 

  I did have close friends that would call, text, or text and pray with me. I could feel the power of prayer very strongly. I had just gotten off the phone with the hospital Chaplin, when the doctor came in the door. He said to me, 'It is time.' I said, 'Time for what?' He replied, 'time to put you on the ventilator. Your lungs need rest, and I don't want to intubate you on an emergency basis.'  He continued, 'You won't feel remember the procedure.' I was scared and answered, 'I am putting this in God's hands now. Let his will be done. 'That was the last thing I would remember for week. 

  I was on the ventilator for a week. They tell me that my airway was unstable and I was a hard person to intubate. During the time I was intubated, I was told that I was going to another state so that I could get better. I thought, 'how nice, my cousin lives there. 'I saw my body being loaded up into an airplane, and I thought, 'I must be worse off than they thought if they are having to med evacuate me to another state.' 

  As soon as we got into the sky, the colors of the sky completely changed. There were colors in the sky that I had never seen before and I could smell the smoke of a campfire.  Why would I smell a campfire?  It seemed as if my senses were on fire. The next thing I knew I was walking towards a friend's house but did not know who the friend was. It was twilight during the fall, even though I knew it was summer in July. The air was crisp and I can still smell the campfire. In my hand was a warm cup of coffee. I sit the coffee as I walked up to the open fire pit behind the house. The backyard was also lined by a forest. There were two lounge chairs waiting for me and my friend to sit down. I could tell there was a presence there, but did not turn my head as I continued to sit on my coffee.

  'I am troubled and believe I am dying,' I told the presence. There was silence for many minutes, but then the presence spoke. When he spoke, I immediately knew who it was because I had heard that voice several times before during my prayers. It was the voice of my Lord, Jesus Christ. He replied, 'perhaps you are.' I answered, 'Lord, I am nothing but a lowly sinner and I am sorry for all that I did, but if you want to take me home with you now, I would consider it an honor.' 

  At that time the trees of the forest started to telescope back and forth and took on the shape of the face of death. A dense fog descended upon the forest and I felt as if I was in the valley of the shadow of death. However, God was with me. I had no fear. I could only hear the hiss of the ventilators and waited death to come. Then, miraculously, the fog lifted and a light with luminous colors appeared. The Lord took my hand and said that I would have to return and fight for my life so I could live with my husband, daughter, mother, and brother. 

  The panorama completely changed to a teakwood background. On the floor, was the crucified Christ lying on his side as if in a deep sleep. I was in awe of his passion and immediately fell to my knees to worship him and I cried.  I was like a child rolled up in a fetal position beside his legs and could feel his hand on my hip. He would not let me go. I knew I was secure and safe. The next moment felt as if someone had pulled me by the scruff of my shirt and into the middle of a cool pool. I it was my ICU nurse, Jack, trying to wake me up from being in a coma. 'Dr. Michelle! Dr. Michelle!  We are trying to get you extubated and off the tube today. Is that all right with you?'  I held up a hearty two thumbs up. Within 30 minutes, the team had all the tubes pulled out. But I was so hoarse from the procedure, I couldn't tell them my good news that I had been with the living God! Once I was stabilized I told my ICU nurse all about my journey and he was very receptive. 

  My friends and family were even more receptive when I came home and told them. As a result, I am now the author of the unpublished book, 'The undiscovered country. A physician's near-death experience.
