    THE FIVE PHASES THEORY    ' &nbsp;

  This article   describes a complete new and astonishing theory about the near-death experience   - based on astrophysics -&nbsp; which includes ten new features. &nbsp;

    In our quest to find answers about the cause, features and supposed differences   of the near-death experience (= NDE),&nbsp; the scientific community has found so   far&nbsp; two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - mainstream - explanations.

    The first one is that the NDE is a neurological phenomenon. And features as the   life review, the notion of being out of the body and seeing strange   (supernatural) things, are caused - for example - by the lack of oxygen, by   electric stimuli, by stress, medication or hallucinations. This neurological   explanation considers the brain as the producer of (features of) the NDE and of   consciousness.

    The second explanation of the NDE is the supernatural one [1]  .   In this theory the brain is considered to be only a receiver of a presumably   large and endless cosmic consciousness. When people experience a NDE, they are   therefore connected with (part of) that special cosmic consciousness. This   supernatural theory explains features like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - for example - the life   review, the idea of travelling (fast) and the feeling of being out of one's   body.

    However, both theories do not take into consideration that there is a link   between severe trauma/sickness on the one hand, and the start of (features of) a   NDE, on the other hand. Moreover: they do not accept the idea that the NDE   becomes more profound and more complete while as the trauma/sickness gets more   life-threatening. This is however not in accordance with the opinion of Atwater,   Moody, Morse and Sabom (amongst other).&nbsp;

    Furthermore, both theories do not take into consideration that the NDE has   successive phases (this is, again, not in accordance with the opinion of, for   instance, Atwater, Fontana, Miner Holden, Moody, Ring). And above all: both   theories do not explain all features of the NDE, as we know it. &nbsp;

    Because of the above, and challenged to discover new features and to develop a   new coherent (all-inclusive) theory, I have analysed hundreds of NDEs. And after   more than ten years of study, I am convinced that there is another - third -   explanation possible, which does connect severe trauma/sickness to the   appearance of a NDE and which includes all known features. And, even more, my   theory describes ten new features.

    Next to this, I consider the NDE as the first part of the final total event that   happens to all of us (with no exception) after we die (this link isn't strange   at all: NDE-people say without the shadow of a doubt that they were physically   dead and that they have seen a glimpse of a life after this life).        &nbsp;

    A preview of this new theory:      &nbsp;

    When we approach the (near) end of life, our sensorial observation decreases,   our awareness changes, and deep down in our physical body (in the atoms) a   fundamental process starts which releases an 'exotic energy' (= light   energy/photons). This special 'exotic energy' is the foundation of an other new   pure and perfect 'body', and another kind of consciousness/awareness. With this   new body (of exotic energy/photons) we can travel through the barrier of space   and time. The (near-)death experience is without a doubt a real voyage. And this   voyage is maybe to the edge of our universe...

    Successive phases based on NDEs:      	  	  	The separation from the physical body;   	  	  	A journey (through a tunnel) to a heavenly light;   	  	  	Being in the presence of the light, nearby a border;   	  	  	The return (through a tunnel)&nbsp; to the physical body (only for NDE-people.   	Dead people do not return: they cross-over);   	  	  	Unification with the physical body.

    Notification:      	  	  	This article is just a summary, so it is impossible to explain all features   	and every single scientific theory.   	  	  	At this moment the Dutch book 'De (bijna-)dood ontrafeld' has not yet been   	translated into English (it is however the intention to do so in the future.   	We'll keep you updated). Nevertheless, this article mentions all features   	(including ten new features of the NDE) in one consistent coherent theory   	based on astrophysical phenomena (the ten new features and the new theory   	are protected by copyright ' December 2006, Maureen Venselaar, The   	Netherlands;&nbsp; and also: copyright ' October 2011&nbsp; publishing firm: Akasha,   	Eeserveen, The Netherlands).    	  	  	Some features appear at the same time.   	  	  	All (known and yet unknown new) features are affirmed in the book 'De   	(bijna-)dood ontrafeld' by hundreds of quoted near-death experiences.   	  	  	The book does not extensively describe the life-changing aspects of the NDE.   	That is why these aspects will not be&nbsp; mentioned in this article.

    &nbsp;     EXPLANATION OF   THE FIVE PHASES THEORY

    &nbsp;     PHASE 1: THE   SEPARATION &nbsp;

    Experiences: &nbsp;

    When people are severely traumatized (for example: due to an accident or   sickness) they lose consciousness. They also hear a strange noise and feel   vibrations and many small explosions deep down in their physical body. Near   death-people receive another consciousness and a different body, almost   instantly and they see their own physical body (autoscopy) while standing - for   example - next to it. This is the begin of the out of body experience, and   near-death people realize that they have a 'ghostly' body of light energy which   is a copy of their physical body. Sometimes they already see other 'beings of   light'. They are their guides to heaven. Near-death people do not feel any   change in their personality and they do not feel the pain of their physical body   anymore. They are happy, in peace. They can hear and see, in a different way,   but they cannot communicate with people (for example: with doctors/nurses who   are giving medical care to the physical body of the near-death person).   Sometimes near-death people hear doctors pronounce a dead-declaration. &nbsp;

    Scientific research:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     	  	  	in and nearby the physical body of near-death people, experts (like Atwater,   	Chawla, Greene) have established that the electromagnetic values change;   	  	  	when atoms of our physical body get damaged or are dying, they release   	exotic light energy, in the form of countless photons (Gurwitch,   	Nobelpricewinner Popp);   	  	  	photons can be consciousness (Popp) and can contain information (Laszlo,   	Schwarz). Besides that: they are indestructible (Hawking);   	  	  	the whole universe is created out of photons (Laszlo, Cox);   	  	  	there are more types of photons/light (for example: with mass, without mass;   	or: visible or not visible). If something (like our physical body) is   	'matter', scientist Bohm says: it is condensed frozen light.

    Bystanders:      &nbsp;

    They sometimes see a foggy light leaving the physical body of the near-death   people (as established by researcher Crookall). &nbsp;

    Cautious conclusion of 'The (near-)death decoded' related to the NDE:        &nbsp;

    We will have a life after this life - as beings of light - due to the fact that   damaged or dying atoms of our physical body release countless photons (= light   energy). These exotic photons can have consciousness (so: at this particular   moment, our daily consciousness - which is connected to the brain under normal   circumstances - will be changed/transformed into another broader transcendent   consciousness);&nbsp; These photons are also indestructible (so the next life can be   an 'eternal' life). And lastly: these photons are capable to 'carry' information   (= the information about who we were and are. Therefore, our new exotic photon   body is more or less the same as our physical body).&nbsp;

    &nbsp;     PHASE 2: THE   JOURNEY THROUGH A TUNNEL&nbsp;      &nbsp;

    Experiences: &nbsp;

    As the trauma gets more severe (or is: very severe) near-death people (as beings   of pure&nbsp; light) are getting more distance from their physical body. They see,   for example, the roof of the hospital. After a while they are surrounded by a   dark space (and they see sometimes grey/dark beings). And (almost) at the same   time, they see the earth, moon, stars, the milky way like astronauts do (=   relativity of space).&nbsp; But they also realize that they are getting as   small as a 'sand of grain' (with their body of light).

    A tunnel opens. Near-death people travels through/turn into this tunnel, with   - or faster than - the speed of light (due to the attraction of a huge   'magnet') (in) to the beautiful heavenly light (that gets bigger and bigger)   at the end of this tunnel. They experience all kinds of sounds and colours.       &nbsp;

    Scientific research :     	  	  	Photons can be non-local (Grinberg);   	  	  	magnetism and light are two aspects of the same substance (Maxwell);   	  	  	light can be influenced by, among other things, attraction and gravity (Cox,   	Mc. Donald);   	  	  	the effect of gravity (collapse) is the contraction of a substance;   	  	  	strong contraction of a substance (for example: the dust and energy of   	stars/galaxies) can lead to a black hole;   	  	  	a black hole is a real hole in the fabric of space. Black holes can be a   	part of wormholes. A wormhole is&nbsp; a tunnel through our space (due to this   	tunnel 'time' can become relative). Such a wormhole (through this universe)   	is called an intra-universe wormhole. Photons can travel through black holes   	and also (probably:) through wormholes without getting destructed (Hawking);   	  	  	very small/tiny wormholes are plausible (Cox, Rujula, CERN).

    &nbsp;

    Cautious conclusion: &nbsp;

    The more we reach the end of this life (due to trauma/sickness) the more photons   are released by our atoms of our physical body. The more photons: the more   compact our new/other body eventually gets (due to magnetism, gravity   (collapse)). And the more compact we'll get: the more the NDE&nbsp; will be complete   and profound (related to all features and phases).&nbsp;

    As beings of light our 'ghostly body of light' will thus be reduced&nbsp; to a small   tiny dot. This seems strange, but, related to the endlessness of our universe,   it is absolutely not important whether we are 1.75m tall or as small as a sand   of grain.

    Next: a tunnel opens, we will travel (as dots of lights) through this tunnel (=   a tiny intra-universe wormhole) faster and faster, and in the end: faster than   the speed of light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (= relativity of time). We approach the most beautiful   light at the end of the tunnel. This light is like a huge 'magnet'&nbsp; to us. &nbsp;

    PHASE 3:&nbsp; FINAL DESTINATION (FOR THE TIME BEING): THE LIGHT. &nbsp;

    Experiences:      &nbsp;

    Near-death people are slowing down (as beings of photons) nearby a heavenly   light/ another beautiful 'world'. They experience however a border and realize:   this border cannot be crossed. Only 'dead people' (as beings of photons) cross   the 'border' and enter the beautiful and lovely eternal light/this other world.

    Over there, nearby the light, near-death people will have a life review   (sometimes a life prospect). They'll meet other beings of light and also a   higher spiritual being of light. Communication is instantly. There is also a   moment of judgement, but that moment is full of grace and love.

    The reason seems to be, according to near-death people:&nbsp; light = love =&nbsp;   knowledge/information. Besides these experiences, near-death people know all the   answers to all the questions of mankind.

    Moreover: there is not only a beautiful light; near-death people see also two   whirl-tornadoes, like an immense 'sand-glass': they tell that the upper   tornado is spinning clockwise and outwards, the lower tornado is spinning not   clockwise and inwards.&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

    &nbsp;

    Scientific&nbsp; research:      	  	  	nearby a black hole there is a border (= an event horizon); photons can stay   	there for a while (Ferguson);   	  	  	gravity and gravity collapse&nbsp; isn't everywhere the same;    	  	  	a black hole is not completely black: it is surrounded by light, very much   	light (Hamilton);   	  	  	a theoretical astrophysical model of our universe and another universe is a   	'sand-glass' (Hawking). This 'sand-glass-model' has an upper 'tornado' and a   	lower 'tornado': the upper tornado is spinning clockwise and outwards, the   	lower tornado is spinning in the opposite direction; Both universes can be   	connected and separated by a huge inter-universe wormhole (Poplawski). This   	wormhole is in both ways a black hole (which is surrounded with light) and a   	white hole. And the wormhole is probably a never ending 'big bang' or   	collision of universes;   	  	  	Light can 'contain' information (Laszlo).

    Cautious conclusions:      &nbsp;

    As near-death people (as beings of light) we are capable to travel - without a   doubt - in

    space-time, through a small tunnel (= intra-universe wormhole) to the edge of   our universe. The image of a 'sandglass' is formed by two tornadoes.

    These are two different universes: one of them is our own universe, the other   one is an astral universe, that consists of subtle vibrations of&nbsp; light.

    Over there - in the middle of these universes, nearby the event-horizon of an   immense&nbsp; black hole of an inter-universe wormhole (= 'door' to another astral   universe) - we'll stay for a while. This black hole is surrounded with light   (and this is a real/concrete magnetic force for us).&nbsp; We have a ghostly body, as   a copy of our physical body (due to changes in gravity/gravity collapse). We'll   meet deceased beloved ones, because they also have received an indestructible   photon body after they died on earth. The communication is almost immediately   and seems to be telepathic (informed photons will be exchanged, almost   instantly). The life review (or prospect) is due to the possibility of photons   to 'carry' information and due to holographic phenomena. The fact that light =   information, explains why we know everything over there (in the light): We know   all answers to all questions of mankind. Besides that, we will definitely   experience a 'border'. This is thus a 'door' to another much bigger 'astral'   universe (so there is probably a very small and very large universe =   Superstring theory). Near-death people do not enter that other universe. Dead   people do. Over there we'll start our eternal life (but that eternal life isn't   endless).      &nbsp;

    PHASE&nbsp; 4: THE RETURN&nbsp;      &nbsp;

    Experiences:      &nbsp;

    Near-death people can (sometimes) choose between a blue/green beam of light or a   red/pink beam .   They know for sure: the blue beam means continuing the life on earth; the red   beam means the end of life on earth (but receiving an eternal life, behind the   door, in another universe). &nbsp;

    &nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;

    Near-death people return, sometimes against their will, again through a - still   open - tunnel (and also as a dot/ a sand of grain/a ball) to their physical   body. For the second time they see stars and planets, just like astronauts do. &nbsp;

    Scientific research:      	  	  	small tiny intra-universe wormholes probably exist (Cox, Rujula, CERN);   	  	  	intra-universe wormholes can make space and time relative (Davies, Mallett);   	  	  	the Doppler effect creates blue/green light due to stars/matter/stardust   	which come closer, and creates red/pink light due to stars/matter/stardust   	which goes farther away from us (Doppler; Hawking).

    Cautious Conclusions:      &nbsp;

    We will return as dots through this tiny personal intra-universe wormhole/tunnel   in space.

    The red and blue colours we'll see, is supposedly based on the Doppler effect:   when we approach the beautiful lovely light, we'll see that matter is coming   towards us (out of the source of everything (which is - as said before - like an   everlasting big bang/a whirlpool of energy that creates everything we know in   this universe). Therefore this matter looks blue/green and means 'life on   earth'. The colour red/pink is created by matter (and so on) which travels   (further) away from us.

    Therefore: the colour red/pink is associated with going farther away into space,   closer to the black hole (= door) and the light (and the other universe) but   farther away from earth and farther from the physical body. In short: red/pink   means: death on earth, but eternal life in another universe, on the other&nbsp; side   of the 'door'. In short: beams of light, in combination with our thoughts   (and/or the thoughts of the higher spiritual being of light) determine our   destiny.

    Overall: thoughts are very important and crucial ,   not only during our life (review), but also to set our goal (destiny) at this   point.

    &nbsp;

    PHASE 5: UNIFICATION &nbsp;

    Experiences:      &nbsp;

  Near-death   people enter their physical bodies as a ball/a dot, and they feel they   expand/swell to get a full connection with their earthly body. They experience   again a kind of vibrations during the realization of this connection, and again   all the pain of their physical body.

    They have forgotten all the wisdom they knew, when they were nearby the heavenly   light. This feature of forgetting is also typical for the NDE and it is   probably the reason why lots of near-death people do not know anything of their   out of body experience and their journey to the edge of our universe and to the   edge of heaven.&nbsp; Sometimes near-death people wish to return to the heavenly   light. &nbsp;

    Scientific research:     	  	  	gravity is nowhere exactly the same: not on earth, not in the universe. So   	the attraction between objects/stars/stardust and so on, is everywhere   	different. Due to (the absence of) gravity objects/stars/stardust can   	cluster (or not).    	  	  	gravity exists on an astrophysical scale (concerning the universe)&nbsp; and on a   	physical scale (concerning particles/quanta) (Cox).

    Cautious conclusion: &nbsp;

    As near-death people, we return to earth with our compact out-of-body essence   (during our journey through the tunnel/the private intra-universe wormhole).   After this journey we will unfold nearby/in our physical body due to the   reduction of the force of gravity. All the light-energy flows back into (the   atoms of) the physical body and connect with it. Electromagnetic values changes   probably again. And after a while - if the trauma doesn't get worse - we will   regain our daily consciousness...
