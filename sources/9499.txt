  		              		Experience Description 

  In early August of 2006 I was leading a small group of eight friends on a three day canoe trip down the Madawaska River through 35 km of Canadian wilderness. Mid-way into the trip we reached a narrow portion of the river where the recent rains had turned the river wild. Despite the danger I felt the invitation to challenge the rapids. Due to the danger, I asked the universe whether I should or shouldn’t run this stretch of rapids. There was no response so I knew I had to find out for myself. What followed next directly led to me writing a book about Living Behind Your Breath. 

   	Soon into the first large waves the canoe flipped and the force of the water on my back drove me into a rock eight feet below the roaring surface. At the moment of impact, my Soul leaped out of my body and for an instant I watched the collision of, body and rock, from the vantage point of looking through my body as my chest gave way to the force of the impact. Then I quickly slipped back into my body realizing that this was serious and I needed to maintain consciousness until I would reach the surface about eight feet above. When I reached the turbulent surface I exhaled my last breath as my heart stopped beating. 

   	As I floated through the remaining rough water towards the foot of the rapids, my friends swam out to rescue me, but I had already left for another world. I had returned to a familiar, comfortable and loving place that I recognized as home. Even though everything was dark and no one there to greet me, I wanted so desperately to remain for it was so comfortable and full of what I knew to be Love. But it wasn’t my time, I couldn’t stay, I had to leave, go back. I was being forced back into a body that I no longer wanted. I fought with every ounce of willpower I could draw on, so as to remain in that beautiful spiritual realm.

   	After three hard fought attempt to resist returning to this physical reality I was over powered. My forced slow re-entry to this reality, came about by dots of energy rushing across my vision from left to right. The full four color spectrum of dotted energy were attempting to form into the structure we call physical. Dots were attempting to become trees, rocks, water and sky. Yet I continued resisting this world, willing myself to remain in the wonderful feeling of my heavenly home and as I did the physical world of multicolored dots would be replaced with darkness and I would return to the familiarity of ultimate Love. I made three attempts not to return to the physical and each process was the same until my will was no match for the energies that wanted me to return to this life. Soon trees, clouds, rocks and water formed from right to left. In seconds the familiar fabric that I knew so well, reconstructed itself out of the darkness of death. Quickly the construct had worked its way into my familiar world and soon I was back in my damaged body hearing the rush of water, feeling my body bounce up and down in the waves and the distant screams of my friends. 

  There was no way of getting me medical help for we were a day and a half from our vehicles with no cell service to call in an emergency helicopter. We were on our own with approximately 15km of canoeing remaining and more rapids yet to navigate. I had many broken and cracked ribs, my sternum was caved in, my blood pressure very low and my heart had shifted. My task was to stay conscious and keep moving. 

  Fortunately, eight years previously in 1998, I had learned the art of breathing to control thoughts, which meant I had control over fear and other anxieties. That allowed all my energy to be acutely focused on each breath. That night the Breath became my best friend. In through my nose, out through my mouth over and over. I still had two more days before getting help. Each breath delivering clean healthy energy and oxygen in and each exhale took the edge off the pain. 

  I pushed the group to keep paddling late into the day, so I could spend the night in a trapper’s small abandoned log cabin at the edge of the river. My night was spent sitting inside on a wooden picnic table, in the company of mice running back and forth along the logs. 

  I concentrated on pushing my broken, distorted ribs back into place and eventually my sternum lost its concave shape. For the first time I was talking to my body like a parent would lovingly comfort a child who needed help. Each breath was an effort, yet each one allowed me to take another, then another. Two days later, in the hospital, I was told that my right lung had collapsed and my chest was filling with fluid. 

  It was there on that picnic table, with the mice all around me, that I realized there was one thing I had not fulfilled. Throughout my life I have been psychic, I approached everything with curiosity, was actively engaged in activism and had fully immersed myself in metaphysical studies. I had so much to offer, but did not yet feel complete. I was unable to speak my truth to the extent I knew I could. 

  I sat teary eyed, thanking the universe for this opportunity for a new life, to complete that one all important part of myself. I would now make speaking my truth a top priority and all I had to do was survive. 

  Something inside was blocking the energy flow and was sabotaging my efforts. 

  Then two years ago, in Mexico and during a discussion group called, Heart 2 Heart, a major blockage was released. The topic was Shame; I thought I had none. It turned out I was mistaken and without warning a lifetime of silenced shame erupted in waves of uncontrolled emotion. I had been hiding shame for being dyslexia. Abilities reading, writing and occasionally speaking were often hindered and embarrassingly challenging. Yet I thought they were so well controlled and managed that there was no shame. 

  The culmination of loving energy within the small group, along with my being unconsciously ready for release, triggered my kundalini to uncoil and release its pent up energies. Waves of emotion erupted from the base of my spine, pulsating my solar plexus muscles, moving through the chest into the shoulders and out my mouth. Tears flowed as a stream and words were inaudible. An emptiness followed and I was finally set free. As of that day my fear of speaking and giving voice to my truth disappeared and I’ve been able to get on with my work ever since. I hope this story helps people realize that the beauty in living is every bit as wonderful as what awaits us on the over side of this earthly experience and being able to embracing our time here with appreciation is our reward.
