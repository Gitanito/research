  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I had a hole in my heart between the right vent and the left vent. I had catheterizations from the time of five years old at Harper Hospital in Detroit until I had open heart surgery in June of 1960 but in 1959 in June, they gave me a catheterization. They took me to the upper floor of the hospital. I was put on a flat steel round table and the pain was awful. All at once, I was above the building with no pain. I realized that someone was with me. The feeling was just wonderful and I just wanted to stay forever, the love to was just great. I was told that I had to go back.

I heard the doctor say, 'Folks we are losing him. Let's bring him back.' I was above the building and daylight was coming up. In the time I was transferred to a gurney, I was back in my body. I did not want to be back in my body because of the pain. I had two doctors operate on me the next year. I was hooked to the lung and heart machine, which was just in the development. I had a fifty/fifty chance of living. The first two patients never made it and I was the third patient. There was someone there with me telling me I had to go back but I did not want to go back. It was so beautiful - the love to all mankind and the world.
