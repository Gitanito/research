TO THE FIRST EDITION.
TmD following Lectures ~ intended to prove, that the God orAbraham, 11uc,
and Jacob, who ia verily a God of truth, ia fulfilling His word with regard to the
multitudinona aeed,-the many nations to come of the house of Ephraim : and
that as truly as He has IIOOODlpliahed Hia purpose, in giving the One Seed,
Cbriat, to oome orthe house of Judah. These nationa have, from the begin-
ning, t-Il in a state of training for their high and important destiny, that or
shewing forth the prai8e of Jehovah, who is the God ol Nature and or Provi-
denee, as well as of Redemption, and whose wondroua wisdom ia manifest in alL
The author holds, with many modern students or prophecy, that the pro-
phecies must be literally fulfilled ; and that Judah must mean Judah, and
larae1 mean, literally, Iarael. At tiM IIIIDie time, he agreea with those who
apply, to these Christian nations, Dl&llY of the prophecies reapecting Israel:
believing, as he does, that these nations have not merely come into the place of
ancient Israel, but are truly the seed or Abraham according to the Beah-are of
the IIOoCIIlled" loet house" or I~the leading tribe of which was Ephraim.
These nations have been brought forth at the time, and in the place predicted:
they are the modem nations or Europe,-and especially those of Saxon race,
whose glorious privilege· it now is, to preach the gospel for a witness unto all
nations ere the end come. How the promised seed have come to be sown in
these countries, ia liccounted for in the latter part of the course; but the author
earnestly requests a careful perusal of the first six Lectures, as it ia upon the
Scriptural foundation there laid, that his after conclusions chiefly rest. These
he has supported by proof, as various in kind, and great in quantity, as, he
tnuta, will be requisite to substantiate the truth of the view he has been led to
entertain. The plan of the Lectnrer has been to look on the aubject in all
points orview; but especially in the light or God's word. In that light would
he ever Jtljoice to look upon all around him,-upon the world and ita inha-
bitant, man; And the wondroua oourse or God's providence, which all hath had
respect to Hia people orIarael,-ofwhom He hath said in truth, " I have chosen
thee, and not cut thee away." Even after they were seemingly cut away, the
God orAbraham atill declared, by hia prophet Jeremiah,-
" I am aFather to Imoael,
And EPIIUIJI it my FlBI:Z:·BOBK,"

QUERIES ON THE SUBJECT OF
THE ISRAELITISH ORIGIN OF THE BRITISH NA'l'ION.
1. Ia not the bonae of larael, and eapecially the tn"be of Ephraim, clearly cU.-
tinguished from that of Judah, in both the historical and prophetical parte of
Scripture? 1 Chron. v. 2; Jer.iii.11. Were not ofEphraimespecially to come,
the many heirs of the promisee made unto the fathere, just aa of Judah waa to
come, the One Heir, from whom the blessing waa immediately to descend? Gen.
:dviii. 15-20; Gen. x1ix. 8-12.
2. Were not the lost tnDe& of Israel to be found in these, the 1aat daya, aa" a
eeed the Lord hath bleBBed?" Hoa. ii.14-23; Ia. :aiL 17-28; 1xi. 9, 10; 1xvi.
8-14; Jer. XJai. 1-10; E&ek. xi. 15-20; Boa. i. 10, 11. Do the signa of
the timee, aa well aa the prophetic datet, indicate the time to be come when God
shall have "accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people?" Dan.
xii 4-7; Ia. vi. 11, 12•.• •
3. Have not all previous attempts to find the lost tnDe& of Israel proved abor-
tive, especially as to the accounting for Ephraim, the heir of the promises made
unto the fathere, and of which waa to come the promised " fulneBB of the Gen-
tiles," or" multitude of nations?" Rom. xi 25; Gen. xlviii. 19; Ia. :rli. 25-29.
Does not the Scripture declare, that the previous non-discovery of Israel has
been oooaaioned by Israel's blindneaa, and not by God's having failed to ful1ill
hiaword? Iaa. xlii. 18-25; xliii. 1-13; xlv. 17-21. Does not the Scrip-
ture expreBBly recognize our present condition as being that in which Israel
would be found? And do they predict matters respecting Israel, which can only
be ful1illed in .these nations? Ia. :uvii. 6-10; Jer. XJai. 10, 11; Mio. vii. 16;
Jer. iii. 18; Ezek. xi. 16, &c.-
4. Does history (which traces our Saxon ancestry beck to the very countries
into which Israel were carried captive by the Assyrians) present anything op-
posed to this view? Tllfl.ler's" .Anglo-Saxons," vol. i 94-102. Is it likely
that the God of truth wcinld utterly cut away the people unto whom the pro-
mises were made; and out of the same place bring forth quite a different people
to have ful1illed to them the promises freely made unto Israel, and so solemnly
confirmed to them by oath? Luke i. 68-75; Rom. xv. 8; Mic. vii. 18-20;
Ia. :av. 1-7; Pa. cv. 10. Conld it thus be said that the gifts and calling of
God a.re without repentance? · Rom. xi. 29; Ia. :rli. 8, 9.
5. .A:re not the intellectual, moral, and physical characteristics of the English
exactly those that were to be expected of the nations promised to come of Eph-
raim? See Lee. IV. on the Training of Israel. Can our ancient religious rites,
political institutions, manners and acquirements, better be accounted for than
aa having been derived from ancient Israel? See Lectures VIIL-XII. Do not
the favonra bestowed upon these nations in the north-west, and the whole course
of God'a dealinga with the Engliah nation, indicate clearly their being under
the kindneaa, and care of the good Shepherd of Israel? Gen. x1ix. 22-26;
Pa. hxL 1-3; c:rlvii. 191 20.

IBAIAB, CHAP. LX.
Tms beautiful portion of Scripture
seems to consist of six smaller por-
tiom, the tint five of which are son-
nets, or songs of fourteen lines each.
The first place6 the hearer in Jerusa-
lem, in the Holy Land, and bids him
look around, and see how the light is
breaking ; and how all &round &re
prepe.ringto flow unto Mount Zion, the
City of the Lord. The next four pa-
ragraphs pointeastward,andwe&twe.rd,
and northwe.rd, and southwe.rd,-tothe
characteristic treasnresofeach que.rter,
as being contributed to that city,
which shall then be the joy of the
whole earth. The sixth paragraph,
in five verses of four lines each, de-
Scribes the settled and increasing state
of glory and ble8116dness which Jeru-
salem shall ultimately evjoy.
The first paragraph is a call to
courage, and to a clee.r exln"bition of
the truth, in anticipation of the com-
ipg glory. Jernsalem is. called to
look around, and see how nnmensely
more numerous her children e.re, and
how much more favourably dealt
with than she had at &II anticipated.
The'd&y dawns; the morning begins
to spread upon the mountains. It is
time to put off the works of d&rkn!lss,
and to go forth, in light and holiness,
to e.rouse a sleeping world to a recog-
nition of the word, and working, and
ways of Jehovah; and to a prepe.red-
ness for the glorious issue of &II his
wonderful acts to the children ofmen.
Let DB, then, feel as one with Jertlll&-
lem, while she is thus addressed by
the Spirit of Prophecy, as anticipating
this time:-
Iealah, ehap. Ix. ver. 1-4.
" Arlie I shine I for thyllgllt lo come,
And the glorr of the Lori II rloen npmt
. th...
For, behold the darluleu lb&U cover tile
earth,
And grou darkneu the peopls 1
But the Lord ahall &rile upon thee,
And hia glorr ahall be aeen upon thee :
And the Gentilea shall come to thy light,
Aud ldnga to the brightneu of thy riling.

AI<O IJ:J:I
All they gather themaelvea together;
They oome to thee I
Thyaona shall come from far,
And thy daughten ohall be nursed at thy
aide."
The second paragraph is a call
upon Jerusalem to look eastward;
and to be filled with holy fee.r to-
ward God, whilat her heart is en-
l&rged toward men, when she sees
how abundantly the God of the whole
earth hath enrich~ her there, with
the means of distributing blessings
among the nations, from the Cape of
Good Hope, to India and Australia.
The Erythrean Sea, with its two
branches, and &II the treasures or
Arabi& between, are hers. The burn-
ing desert, now abundantly refreshed,
will contribute its rich and ve.ried,
productions as pr~Maion for the home
of the Lord's glory:-
THE BAST.
Ver.l-4.
" Theil thou ohalt see,
And 11ow togetb•r 1
4nd thine heart shall rear,
And be enlarged,
Beeauoe the abundance of the N& shall be
converted unto thee,
The forcea of the Genti!H ahall come unto
thee.

All ther &om Sheba aball oome :
Ther aball bring gold and lncenae ;
And they aball abow forth the pralaea of
the Lord.
All the .ftocka of Kedar aball be sa&bered
together unto thee,
The rama of Nebaloth aball mlnlater unto
thee:
TheJ aball come up with acceptance oa
mine alar."
The third sonnet turns the eye
westward, and sees the swiftly-sailing
steam-ships, with undeviating aim,
stretching up the Mediterranean ;
bringing in abundance the children of
Zion, with their treasures, unto the
Lord. No more may Israel be termed
Lo-rnhamah; seeing that from this
quarter it is so truly manifest, that
the Most High, in his favour, hath
indeed Aad mercy 011 Aer:-
THE WEST.
Ver. 8-10.
H And J will glorify the bouae of mrglory.

Surely the lalea ahall walt for me,
And the ablpa of Tarabilb ftnt,

Becauae he hath glori.fted thee.
And the aona of atrangera aball bulld up
thy walla,
And their kluge ahall mlnlater unto thee.
For In my wrath I emote thee,
Butlbee!T favour have I had mercy on
The fourth IOIIDet looks northward,
and sees the gates of the enemy given
into the hands of Iarael, and all her
former opprel801'8 and despoilers made
tmbmissive, or brought to nought.-
The ravenous beasts from the north
- the wolf, the leopard, the bear,
and the lion, and all others, which
may attempt to spoil the land, shall
at length cease to devour upon the
Lord's lloly mountain. And the
glory of Lebanon (in this quarter of
the land) ahall be all her own:-
THE NORTH.
Ver.ll-14.
" Therefore thr plel ahall he open con-
tlnuaiiJ;
Ther aball not he abut dar nor night ;
That-may bring unto thee the for- of

And--their klas-broqht.

the-lvea down at the aolea of thJ
feet;
.AD<l they shall eall thee, the cllf of the
Loan,

. The fif\h paragraph looks south-
ward, and sees the Redemption, pre-
figured by that from Egypt, made
complete. And it is intimated that
the rioh mineral treasure~~ of ldumea,
here on the south, are equally hera,
as the trees of Lebanon in the north.
All the bondage and oppression, with
which the children of Africa have so
long been visited, are at an end,-at
the same time that all contribute to
Jerusalem's glory andjoy:-

LECTURE I.
ISRAEL'S ANCESTRY, AND THE THREE GRAND RACES OF
MANKIND.
THE GIFT~ AND CALLING OF ISRAEL.
"Remember the days of old,
Consider the years of many generations :
Ask thy Father, and He will show thee;
Thy elders, and they will tell thee.
When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
When He separated the 110118 of Adam,
He set the bounds of the ~le,
According to the number of the children of larae!.
For the Lord"a portion-his people;
Jacob-the lot of his inheritance.'" Deut. nxii. 7-9.
The Adamic Dispen•ation.-The Flood.-Prophecy in the Names between Adam and
Noah.-Covenant with Noab.-Babel.-The names between Noah and Abram.-Three
Grand Races of Mankind: the Tartar Race; the Negro Race; the Caucasian Race.-
The European Family.- The Prophecy of Noah.-Contrast of the European Family with
the most anciently civilized Portions of the Three Grand Races.-Reference to Deut.
chap. xnii.,aa expressing God"s Designs with regard to Iarae!.
GoD made man upright,-made him
in his own image; and he was equally
happy as he was holy. His will was
in unison with that of the Framer
and Sustainer of all things; and being
in harmony thuswith universal nature,
suffered not those painful collisions,
to which it is now so constantly ex-
posed in consequence of sin. As man
became alienated from God-from the
trne good-the light of Jehovah's
countenance, so did he become subject
to that wretchednell8, which results
from his po88888ing active powers,
adapted for communion with the spiri-
tual world, without these having any-
thing proper upon which to fix them-
selves. In this low estate man was not
left by Himwho alone could help him.
God manifested himself unto Adam
in a manner fitted to man's fallen con-
dition. Salvation through the great
atoning aacrifice was then revealed.
It was promised that the Seed of the
woman should bruise the serpent's
head ; and, in place of the insufficient
B
covering ofhis own workmanship, with
which man, in his first emotions of
shame, had covered himself, he was
clothedwithskins-as wesuppose,with
the skins of the animals slain in aacri-
fice, in the first institution of that
new mode of worship, which was now
given to man, as requiring to be re-
deemed by the blood-shedding of the
Lamb of God ;-as requiring to be
clothed with the righteousness of Him
in whose name alone we may ap-
proach the Father.
The good seed being thus sown in
the first family of mankind, they were
allowed to multiply and replenish the
earth. But, even in that early period ·
of our world, there was a distinction
of races. The descendants of Cain
were emphatically wicked; whilst the
sons of Seth (see Gen. vi. 22) are
called " the sons of God." In process
of time these two races intermingled,
and the result was a most powerful
progeny; but theirpowerwasnotcon-
seorated to the Lord. Men, as they
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
18 PilOPBBCY Ill' lf.lMU, J'BOM .&DAil TO NOAH. (!.Be. I.
grew mighty, became monsters in
wickedneu; and as they replenished
the earth, they equally filled it with
violenoe. Their enormities called for
vengeance from Heaven; and the
waters ofthe flood were sent to quench
the fire of their lust; and to sweep
them, with their works of wickedness,
from the face of the earth.
Of all the families of mankind,
only one was spared, the family of
Noah; which, together with the indi-
viduals that had intermarried there-
with, was preserved in the ark, which
Noah was directed to prepare, during
the hundred and twenty years in
which he testified against that un-
godly generation, and preached righte-
ousneu, pointing to that rest that re-
maineth for the people of God, and
of which the ark was a type.
It has been remarked that God was
preaching righteousness from the very
beginning; and had been writing his
Gospel in the very names of Noah and
his progenitors, even from the crea-
tion of man upon the earth. Thus
the name of Adam may either mean
red earth, out of which man was
formed, or it may be from the He-
brew word signiJYing i~ ; and,
made of earth, man was formed after
the image of God; which image we
lost in the first Adam, who is of the
earth earthy; and we have it restored
in the second Adam, who is the Lord
from heaven. Seth, the eon of Adam,
hath his name, meaning plou,d; man,
made of earth, and in the image of
God,wasplaced in Eden byhis Maker;
but, by his sin, he placed himself in a
wilderness of thorns and briers. And
then Enos means mortal, ·referring to
the deatlaful state into which man was
precipitated by his fall into sin. Cai-
nan means milerahle, the chamcter of
that state of spiritual death, in which
man is now found. But Mahala.leel
brings into view the Lord, the Saviour;
this name meaning the Bluled God,
or, God tOM uIDOf'flJy of all praile,-
which the Word was, even before He
came down to earth to acoomplish our
redemption. His humbling himself is
in the next name expreued, Jared,
meaning he lluallduMtd : He humbled
himself, to take upon him the form of
a servant, and to become a Messenger
to those who received his me8811ge with
the utmost despite. This service is
expressed in the next name, Enoch,
which means teool&ing. The ministry
which he fulfilled, until the time of
his being offered up, was that of a
Teacher, sent from God. Never man
spake like this man; and the subject
of his teaching to his chosen disciples,
much related to the decease he shonld
acoomplish at Jerusalem. And this
seems to be the o\Uect pointed at by
the next name, Methuaelah, meaning,
He tOM died lludllend. He died for
our sins, and rose again for our justi-
fication. And then did He who said,
" I am not mat but to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel," Mmd forth his
apostles, with power, on the same
blessed errand. Lamech means, to t.W
a.fflicted ; and to the afflicted, the
" to88ed with tempest and not com-
forted"- the desolate woman- the
lost house of Israel, which had gone
into the north country, was the Gos-
pel more especially sent. The name
Noah, describes the character of the
m(!8811ge, which hath proceeded from
Jerusalem, through Judea,-through
Samaria,- through Asia Minor, -
through Greece,-and still more and
more north-westward, until, having

faintly shadowed forth by the ark
that was built by Noah.
Thus, in the first names of man-
kind, the ten betweenAdam and Noah,
we have, most distinctly written, the
great purpose of Jehovah with regard
to Israel in partionlar, and mankind
generally. The names, together, as

lation." The " affiictions of Joseph,"
and the fact that the blessings of the
Gospel have been mainly addrelll!ed to
his descendants, and, through them,
to the world, will hereafter engage our
attention.
With Noah, a new covenant was
made. It was, that no such sudden
destruction, by the water of a. flood,
should end the present, as it had the
past dispensa.tion. His children might,
therefore, with confidence go forward
to multiply and replenish the earth;
and the bow in the cloud was ap-
pointed to be a token of this cove-
nant, that, when they looked upon it,
they might think upon God's remem-
bering his promise, that the showers
should fall in measure; that the clouds
should be girt, as it were, with the
band of the Almighty; and no more
burst upon the world with the waters
of a universa.l deluge. The family of
Noah seem then to have left the
mountains, and come down to the
more inviting plain, in the land of
Shinar. If the land of Iara.el be, as
there is reason to believe, the site of
Eden, then the land of Shinar, which
is eastward of that, ma.y be the very
land into which the first great tyrant
among mankind, Cain, went from the
presence of the Lord, and built a city
for his son. Here, in the site of Ba.-
bylon, the first of tha.t list of tyrant
empires, that have so sought to lord
it over men, and persecute those that
ha.ve occupied the place of righteous
Abel; here, thus early, did they seek
to centralise the human race, in a
grand confederacy against the will of
Heaven. Thus early did Babylon op-
pose itself to the King of Salem, who
hath chosen Zion, and desired it
for his habitation; sa.ying, " This is
my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for
I have desired it." The Lord con-
foWJded the folly of these early
founders of a universa.l empire inde-
pendent of Him who alone hath a right
to reign. He forced the rebela to dis-
perse; and the three families of Noah
B2
were at length, according to the di-
vine a.ppointment, scattered abroad
upon the face of all the earth.
The dispensa.tion of Noah, like the
Adamic, Wl'nt into utter apostacy; and
the whole world was being covered
with idolatry ; but God remembered
his covenant with Noah, and brought
not such a sudden all-sweeping judg-
ment as the flood, to sweep away all
his posterity at once from the face of
the earth. He adopted another method
of dealing with ma.nkind. He chose
one, to whom and to whose posterity,
he meant to showespecial fa.vour, and
upon whom he would bestow a very
superior training; who should be the
depositary of his lively oracles, and
the medium through which he would
communicate with the other families
of mankind.
Before prooeediing to trace farther
the purposes of God with regard to
his chosen race, aud to identify them
among the nations, it ma.y he good to
understand well what the general
masses of ma.nkind are, from whom
they are to he distinguished,and among
whom they were to be a blessing.
The Grand Races of mankind ma.y
properly he reckoned three in number.
These have been distinguished from
each other by their form of head, and
other physical marks, as well as by
intellectual and moral character : not
that any one of them has qualities
which the other is entirely without;
but the different races possess in very
different degrees and modifications
those qualities which are common to
all. The races are in very many cases
in a considerably mixed state; but
still in the ma.sses they ma.y be marked
out from each other, and they are
known as the Calmuc-Tartar, the
Caucasian, and the Negro.
The Huns, or otherwise the Cal-
roue-Tartar race, seem to ha.ve been
appointed the northern portion of the
globe. There they exist, in very dif-
ferent conditions. As Laplanders,
they, in the extreme north, live much
unlike their brethren, tra.vereing the
grea.t wilds between Russia and China;
and still more are they unlike the
o;g,tiwd by Coogle

Chinese themselves, who, as being
most stationary, seem to have retained
more of the ancient civilization of the
race, as received from the first fathers
of mankind. Europe appears to have
been anciently possessed by this race;
and America was found considerably
peopled by them, when that country
was discovered by the modern pos-
sessors of Europe; who, with such
power, have, in the latter ages of the
world, come rolling from the East.
Except in the case of China, the Ja-
phetic race are generally found very
thinly spread over a very wide terri-
tory. The race we are describing
have much breadth of face, and great
width between the eyes. The cheek-
bones are wide asnnder, and promi-
' nent; and the whole head is in gene-
ral very broad. Allthis is correspond-
ent with their general character, as
being restless and roving, and in many
cases addicted to violence and war;
pnJ>atient they are of restraint, and
ambitious ·of a proud independence.
The warlike propensities, and those
that principally tend to muscular ac-
tivity, have their organs situated on
the side of the head, and occa-
sion the breadth of head already de-
scribed. The physiognomy, other-
wise, is correspondent: the features
are harsh; the parts not well propor-
tioned, according to our ideas of
beauty; the hair is long and straight.
The beard is scanty: in. some,. as in
the North .American Indians, .it does
scarcely at all exist; but that seems
to be partly produced by art, just as,
in the case of the Charibs, the breadth
of head has ·been aggravated by pres-
sure in infancy. The complexion is
pretty uniform, bein_g somewhat of an
olive hue; but still.,. is varied, from
that of the dun Laplander, to the co-
lour of the red Indian, traversing his
wide-spreading wilds; where the phy-
sical powers must of course obtain
more free expansion, than amid the
snows of Lapland, or where they are
cooped up so closely as in China.
Correspondent to their form of head,
this race have in general manifested
considerable mechanical skill; and
they have frequently made very ex-
tensive conquests. These, however,
they more easily make than retain.
They can execute; but seem rather
wanting in masterly wisdom. They
require a superior moral and intellec-
tual power, to guide their great force
to a proper end. They do not suffi-
ciently care for those under them.
Here, again, China seems to be rather
an exception: but, even there, the ex-
posing of children is allowed. ·This,
the Japhetic race, has less care for
their children than either of the other
races; and it may easily be observed
that in them, generally, there is less
of a projection over the cerebellum,
in the region of the head allotted to
that propensity which gives an in-
terest in the young.
On the opposite side of the globe,
that is southward, and chiefly in the
vast continent of Africa, we have the
Negro race, the supposed descendants
of Ham. These in general have the
head elongated behind, forming in
this respect a considerable contrast to
the Japhetic race: and the Negroes
are as remarkable for their love of
children andfondness ofnursing,as the
Tartar tribes are for their indifference
in these respects. The forehead is
narrower, and perhaps also lower ;
correspondent to their defioiency in
reasoning power, and in mflChanioal
ingenuity. They have generally a
good height in the upper and middle
part of the head, where .is the organ
of veneration ; but they are consider-
ably deficient in that which gives a
tendency to form ideas ~espect4ig the
spiritual world, and to hold commu-
nion therewith : the mind is conse-
quently left more to the influence of
objects of sense; and the worship is
apt to be rendered to the sensible
creature, rather than to the unseen
Creator. They thus, the more easily,
become subject to Qthers. They can
have intelligence, but they seem to
have little forethought or power of
planning. They require to be cared
for like children. They can, of course,
be the more easily seduced into un-
reasonable acts; but they have much
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
LEe. 1.] CAUCA81Al( RACE, IlllPROVED FAMILY OF. 21
gentleness and affection, and power of
being made useful when properly
trained. Their mildness is indicated
by a. comparative narrowness of the
head, over the ears. The wide-headed
Japhetic race cannot be so easily ma-
naged. It need scarcely be remarked,
that the Negro race are generally dis-
tinguished by the prominell£e of the
lower part of the face, especially the
mout)l, indicating perhaps consider-
able sensitiveness as to touch. They
have black, woolly, strongly-curled
hair: and the blackness of the skin
is about as uniform with regard to the
cJ:illdren of Ham, as the brown colour
is to the descendants of Japhet. That,
however, seems mainly occasioned by
climate. In some countries, the chil-
dren of Ham are comparatively white.
This race appears to have early taken
possession of the lands in which the
fumilies of Abraham were first to be
, planted: thus, Cush inhabited Arabia,
destined for Ishmael, and Canaan
took possession of the very land of
promise itself; and even north-east-
ward of theee countries, in ill-fated
Babylon, we find Nimrod, the mighty
hunter before God, erecting the throne
of his empire. This central position
was not, however, designed for the de-
scendants of Ham. They have long
been expelled from their usurped do-
main.
The children of Shem, genernlly
called the Caucasian race, occupy the
central position; and chiefly inhabit
Southern Asia. We find them spread
over Armenia, Persia, Arabia, and the
thickly-peopled regions of India. The
Jews are an improved specimen of this
race; and so also are " the chief of
the nations," the modem inhabitants
of Europe. These people are gene-
rnlly charncterized by an oval face,
with regular features. The head is
more remarkable for height than either
for len~h or breadth, although it has
in general a goodly proportion of both.
The upper part of the forehead, the
reUective region, is especially well de-
veloped; and so also is the imagina-
tive - immediately outward from
thence. They have the largest pro-
pOrtion of thoee powers which regard
the spiritual world, and which tend to
give an elevated and refined exercise
to the intellect. In this race, the
beard, when allowed to grow, is abun-.
dant. The hair is more soft and pliant
than in any of the other two families.
As for stature and complexion, they
seem to be greatly modified by cli-
mate: in some quarters, as in the
burning plains of India, this race may
be found quite black. In more ele
vated situations, and in temperate
climes, they are found fair, and more
fair, until in Europe we find them
with the lily hand and rosy cheek, the
azure eye and flaxen hair; and cor-
responding to Jeremiah's description of
what his people once were. Lam.
iv. 7:-
" Her Nazaritea were purer than snow,
Tltey were whiter than ntilk,
They were more ruddy in body than
rubies, .
Their polishing was of sapphire."
This race may more generally be
characterized by the head elevatedand
elongated in front, the delicacy of the
texture, and the beautiful proportion
of the features. It may be remarked
that although the head is more finely
formed, indicating a greater proportion
of the reflective faculties, ima,o-inative
powers, and religious sentiments, yet,
altogether, the mind has Jess force:
and this is indicated by the compara-
tive smallness of the head. The brain
is better in quality and form, but Jess
in quantity. The case of the Jews,
and that of the modern possessors of
Europe, is an exception to the latter.
part of this rule; as, here, the head is
not ouly more beautifully formed than:
in even the other branches of the Se-
metic family, but it is greater in
volume than in the case of either the
Negro, on the one hand, or the Tartar,·
on the other.
It maybe observed that this improv-
ed specimen-the European branch
of the Semetic family-is rapidly
spreading westward. From the East,
they came into the maritime parts of
Europe; and have gradually pushed
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
22 THB PBOPBBCT OF lfOAIL (LEo. L
the people to the enda of the earth,
who previously posee88ed theee coun-
tries; or they have taken them up, to
become one people with them, and to
be made partakers with them of their
blessings. Thia improved family of
the Semetic race, after renewing their
strength in theee islands, havelaunched
out into the great Atlantic; and the
tide of emigration has rolled, over
that world of waters, still further
westward,---ilncroaching still upon the
Japhetic race in America, as it did
in Europe. And we may predict
that this race will still further spread,
until the wilderness be wholly in-
habited; and " the deeert rejoice and
blossom as the rose." With all their
faults, they seem to be, eminently, a
seed which the Lord hath blessed.
In Genesis, ix. 25-27, there is a
~kable prophecy of Noah, with
regard to his three sons. We there
find Ham (t>. 25) punished in his seed;
and this is a point in which, judging
from his race, he would be most likely
to feel: whilst Shem ("· 26) is blessed
in the object of his religious regard;
and the religious sentiments are in his
descendantsthestrongest. AndJaphet,
whose restless spirit sought large room
in which to range, was promised en-
largement (t>. 27.) According to the
view we have taken, Japhet has been
originally given the largest possessions;
and this race have been remarkable for
their wide spreading. They ha'\"e also
been given enlargement of a still more
importantkind. Having becomemuch
mingled with the posterity of Shem,
they do as it were dwell in their tents,
filling the place of upper servant:
whilst, not only has Canaan been
cursed, but the lower place-that of
the mere slave, has generally been left
to the other children of Ham. God
has especially manifested himself, and
his great salvation, to the posterity of
Shem; who have even, as we have
seen, the greatest natural capacity for
this kind of knowledge: and, with the
Semetic race, not only has the true
religion been more abundant, but false
religions have also been more plenti-
ful. The truth, however, shall prevail:
and then indeed shall Shem be blessed,
and be given still more fully his place
at the head of the human family.
Japhet, intermingled with Shem, shall
occupy the place of a servant born in
the house: whilst Canaan shall have
the curse removed, and be ble88ed
through the ministration of Shem;
and the whole human family, taking
refuge in the ark of the covenant, shall
become the blissful family of God.
A singular contrast may be observed
to take place between the European
family, and even the moat civilized
portions of each of the three grand
races already descn"bed. Beside the
Nomadic branches of these races,-
who, as being too far separated from
the main stems, to retain the full ad-
vantages of the ancient civilization,
possessed by the immediate descend-
ants of Noah; or, who, in consequence
of other changes, have been thrown
into a state of utter barbarism ;-beside
these, who have lost so much, and
who, without the assistance of others,
seem utterly incapable of regaining
what they have lost-there seems to
have been a portion ofeach of the three
grand races, which, as being more
stationary in the original seats of man-
kind, have retained a sufficient know-
ledge of nature and of art, to procure
for them the appellation of cWiliwl.
Thus, of the same race with the
wandering Tartars, but considerably
different, in consequence of circum-
atances,-we have the Chinese. Of
the Semetic, or Caucasian race, we
have the Hindoos; and of the children
of Ham, of the same general race with
the Negroes, we have the most ancient-
ly civilized empire of Egypt, and their
kindred, along the coast of Palestine.
These three nations, the Chinese, the
Hindoos, and the Egyptians, appear to
have retained what they have, from
time immemorial; and they seem in
some instancesrather to have lost than
gained. And the practice of the arta
they have often retained, without
knowing the principle, according to
which the effect they aim at is pro-
duced. They merely, as it were, "ith
difficulty, retain what has been d!lliver-

ed to them from their fathers. Not so
the European family, and especially
that of Saxon origin. They had lost
all,-they were atripped naked, as in
the day when they were born, (see
H08. ii. 3,) when they presented them-
selves here in the west; but they have
not remained as those generally do,
who are left; thus destitute. They
have evidently been given a principle
of lif--.n onward tendency-which
is not merely of use to themselves,
but it, in general, gives an impetus to
all with whom they come into contact;
who must either yield themselves to
its infiuence, or be broken down by it.
Theirs is not merely a retentive capa-
city, but an inventive genius. Theirs
is not a contentment in empirical prac-
tice: they must know the principles of
the arte they practise; by the know-
ledge of which, not onlyis the retention
of the art the more insured; but a way
is opened up for new improvements
and discoveries. The great work of
self-instruction is ever going forward.
They are not bound down to the limits
of the knowledge poseessed by their
fathers. They are wiser than all their
teachers among men, for God himself
is their Instmctor-both in nature and
in grace; and He hath given them a
capacity to receive his instmction, and
communicate it to others, above what
any nation, or number of nations, have
ever possessed. This is no matter of
chance. We shall see that it is accord-
ing to the origi.oal purpose, and whole
course, of God's procedure with regard
to IsraeL
In that remarkable song of Moses,
Dent. xxxii. we are told that-
"When the Moot High divided to the
nation• their Inheritance i
When be aeparated the 10n1 of Adam,
He oet the bonnda of the people
According to the number of the cbll-
dren of Iarael."
Why should the Lord thus set the
bounds of other nations, according to
the. number of a people not yet born
into the world ? Because this people
were intended tocompass these nations;
which they could not do, unless their
numbers were proportionate to the
bounds of the people they were intend-
ed to encompass; and so it follows:
" For the Lord'a portion II hia people,
And lacob Ia the lot (t.\41 io, cord or
_,..., li,..) of hia Inheritance."
And then follows a description of
the careful training, by which they
should be so far fitted for the import-
ant purpOses which God had in view
with regard to them.-And then there
is an extended prophecy, clearly re-
cognising the fact, that the end which
God had in view with regard to Israel,
was not accomplished during their
former sojourn in the land:-nor could
it indeed be, without their going forth
out of the land, and encompassing the
various nations the Lord intended to
bring within his fold. When this end
is accomplished, then goea forth the
joyful invitation with which the song
concludes:-
.. Rejoice. 0 r• natlone, with hll people;
For he •ill &Y&Dge the blood of his aervanta,
And will render vengeance to hia adveraarlea;

The Land doubly lost and won.
IN the VISJY centre of the three
grand familiee of mankind, as already
described, is placed the land of Israel:
whilst, with regard to the nations of
Europe, in relation to that land, it may
emphatically be said, " They are at
hand to come." They, in general,
mayreach it either byland or bywater.
Our course is by the Mediterranean:
as we ascend which, what interesting
scenes open upon our viewI At the
very entrance, we are, in Gibraltar,
presented with one of the grand posi-
tions, which have been given to Britain,
for the transmission of truth, and the
establishment of righteousness, all
over the globe. Alas, that these posi-
tions should hitherto have been 80
feebly occupied, as to the pnrposes for
which they have been designed by the
God of Israel. Here, al80,--<~n the
one side, Spain, and on the other,
Morocco,-we behold the scenes of
intense suffering: and of the attempted
deep degradation of the Jews; our
kinsmen, as we shall see, even accord-
ing to the llesh. As we ascend, Rome
on the left hand, and Carthage on the
right, remind us of most important
events, OODDected both with ancient
Heathen story, and with the history
of the Christian Church. In the mean
time, we may be passing over the
treaauree rifted from the Temple at
Jerusalem; and, since, rifted from
Rome: and now lying, with much
other treasure, in the bottom of this
sea. And here, ai;a.UI, our nation has,
in Malta, been given a most important
position, in relation to these interesting
portions of the globe; whilst, further
to the left, and, as it were, embracing
Greece, we have the protectorship of
the seven islands, forming the Ionian
Republic. We p&BI! Greece, in which
so much of an enduring nature was

which he was then 10 miraculously
called, in a vision, by a man of
Macedonia. A. we ucend, we have,
on this side, the site of the seven
Churches of Asia, towards which, in
its firllt movement north-westward, we
have our attention called, by the spirit
of prophecy, in the Apocalypse, that
closes thevolumeofinspiration; whilst,
on the other hand, we have, emptied
into this sea, the Nile, the great river
of Egypt, on the banks of which were
transacted some of the most remark-
able events recorded in the first booka
of the Bible. And now we have

Here waa Tyre, the root of that great
maritime confederacy, which, in 1t1ch
earlyages, connected very distant parte
of the globe:-which, even th0118&11da
ofyears ago, brought the British lales,
the isl.es afar off, the IBI.es of Tarahish,
into commercial alliance with the land
of Israel; and which, in the providence
of God, waa given the greatest facilities
for transmitting the escaped of Israel

ed to carry into captivity the body of
the people northward. Each of these,
Tyre and Assyria, was the most fitting
instrnment for the part of that work
to which it was appointed, although
we may believe that nothing was fur-
ther from their hearts than to accom-
plish God's good pleasure to his first.
born Israel; and thereby to the world.
We now enter upon the mountaina
of Israel, where wandered the Patri-
archs, Abraham, laaao, and Jaoob;-
where ministeredMelchizedek,priest of
the Most High God;-to which, by the
cloud of glory, and the ministry of
Moses and Joshua, were conducted
God's ancient people;-where waa
erected the throne of David;-where
waa reared the Temple of Solomon;-
where the prophets delivered the
counsels of Jehovah;-and where the
high priest of the nation wasallowed to
come into the very presence ofthe God
of Israel;-where the Lord of Glory
himself, in our very nature, con-
descended to tabernacle amoug men;-
and where the great atonement waa
offered ;-and whence the Great High
Priest ucended up into the holiest of
all ;-1U1d upon which so copioualy
descended the former rain, when,
having aacended up on high, " He
received gifts to give unto men, yea
for the rebellioua also," (that is, the
beckaliding bonae of Israel,) " that the
Lord God might dwell amoug them."
This land, so distinguished in the
word and providen~ of God, muat be,
at least, near that which was the most
early favoured of God. In this neigh-
bourhood seems to have been situated
Eden, where was placed the first family
of mankind, in a state of innocence
and blisa. It seems worthy ofremark,
that both the states already adverted
to, Tyre and Assyria, are spoken of in
Scripture as bordering upon Eden and
the Garden of God. And the land
which bordered upon these two states,
in common, as being situated between
them, was the land of Israel ;-so
marked as the theatre of God's grand
manifestations to man. Tyre was on
the western coast of the land of Israel;
and in Ezek. xxviii. 13, it is said of
the Prince or King of Tyrus,
"Thou hast been In EnEN, the GAR.DRW

- Tyre, be it remarked, was close
upon Mount Lebanon, one of the most
distinguished and elevated portions of
the land of Israel.
Let us now pass over to the north-
eastern bound of the land-to Assyria,
and we shall find a country, equally
with Tyre, spoken of as being in the
immediate neighbourhood of Eden, or
tile Garden of God; and that also, as
being connected with Lebanon. Thua
in Ezek. xxxi., the Lord, by the pro-
phet, addressing the King of Egypt
(which country, be it observed, was
at the south-western extremity of the
land of Israel), speaks of Assyria, who
dwelt at the north-eastern border:

011 Goo, enYied him. ''-(11. 8, 9.) " I
made the nationa to abate at the oound
of hio fall. When I cut him down to
bell with them that deocend Into the pit.
And all the treeo of En••· the choice and
beot of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall
be comforted in the nether parto of the
earth."-(" 16).
And then, speaking ofPharaoh him-
aelf, the prophecy concludes-(t>. 18).
" To whom art thou thua like, In glory and
in greatne11, among the treea of Ena11 I
Yet ahalt thou be brought down with the
treea of En Kll ; unto the nether parto of
the earth : thou ahalt lie in the midat of
the uncircumciled, with them that be alaln
with the oword. Tblo lo Pharaoh, and all
his multitude, aaith the Lord God."
Thus are the trees of Eden, and of
Lebanon, spoken of, as if the same
thing were meant by either expression:
and thus is the case of Assyria illus-
trated to Egypt, by imagery derived
from the Garden of God; which, as we
suppose, lay between them, and the
advantages of which highly-favoured
position, they both of them, in part,
enjoyed. Even with regard to that
portion of this intermediate space,
which is now most remarkably under
the curse, it is said, Gen. xiii. 10,
" And Lot lifted up his eyes, and
beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it
was well watered everywhere, before
the Lord destroyed Sodom and Go-
morrah, even as the garden of the
Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou
comest unto Zonr." Even more ea$-
ward, in the land of Arabia, Mount
Horeb is called the Mountain of God:
and the ground there, was said to be
holy ground; and there the Lord
condescended to apeak with man; and
there the law was promulgated, and
the tabemacle set up; and there it was
that the rod of Moses drew water from
the rock, to give drink to the hosts of
Israel;· a pledge, we may regard it,
that streams shall yet abundantly
refresh that bnming desert, when it
shall be claimed by their King, as
belonging to the portion of Israel.
The land of Israel, as being situated
between Assyria and Egypt, is mo5
centrally placed with regard to all
lands: on the side of Egypt, all
Africa being stretched out from it to
the east and west; and on the side
of Assyria, we have the still greater
portion of our hemisphere, in Asia and
Europe: from all parts of which, it is
not too mncb to suppose, that highways
will yet be cast up, whereby an easy
conveyance will be prepared, for all to
flow unto the land of Israel; to the
name of the Lord,-to Jerusalem. It
is here these highways caD most
conveniently converge, supposing them
to reach out unto Africa; or supposing
them to lead out ofAfrica, into Europe
and Asia.
By the Mediterranean, it has west-
ward not only a connection by sea
with the coasts of Africa and Europe,
but with the great Atlantic Ocean, and
thereby with America, the more dis-
tant portion of our globe to the west.
South-eastward of the land, we have
the Red Sea, that " compasaetb the
land of Ethiopia;" and by which we
reach out to the great Indian Ocean,
and thereby gain Australia, the coun-
terpart of South America, as the
islands northward of it are of the
West India Islands; and as the more
eastem part of Asia, if separated from
the more westward portion, would be
the counterpart of North America.
We have, beside these, the Persian
Gulf, " which goeth toward the east-
ward ofAssyria," branching out to the
coasts of India and China. We must
indeed see that the land of Israel is
most centrally placed, with regard to
land, and the three grand races of
mankind. Here, our brethren in
America, Australia, the Cape of Good
Hope, and India, may most conve-
niently meet with the inhabitants of
Britain. And, further, the land of
Israel is one, in which the sun-burnt
Indian may meet with the inhabitants
of Iceland; and the wanderer of the
desert, with the children ofErin'sgreen

isle. The iB.habitants of all countries
may here join in sweet fellowship,
without any '()f them feeling as if he
went far from his home, to meet with
his most distant brother. Here, where
the Moat High hath appointed, mny
moat appropriately, be placed the
throne of univeraa.l empire. However
widely scattered may be their posses-
sions over the globe, this is moat fit to
be the common home of the hwnan
family. The Mind that appointed this,
when the relations of this land to the
more distant parts of the globe were
to man unknCJWD, must have been that
of our Father in heaven, the God of
that grace which was hence sent forth,
to collect the scattered into one:-the
God of that glory which shall be
enjoyed, when He shall here reign as
described, Ps. xivii. 8, ~:
" God reignetb over the nations :
God sitteth upon the throneor blo hollnese:
The poiaceo of the people are gathered
together;
The people of the God orAbralaam :
Por theshlelda ofthe earth belong unto God:
Hell greatly exalted."
The land we are now considering
was thus characterized by the God of
Israel, when they were about being
given the pol!M88ion of it, under that
covenant which they alm08t immedi-
ately and continuously broke. Dent.
viii. 7-10:-
.. Tbe I.ord thy God briDg&th tltee into a
good land.
A land of brooks or water,
or fountains and deptbs
That spring out of •alleys and blllo ;
A land or wheat and barley,
And vines, and fig-trees, and pomogra-
nateo:
A land or oil-olive and honey ;
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread
without acarcenea;
Thou shalt ftOt lock anythlnlf In It:
A land wltooe otonea are iron.
A::,:t or wbooe hillo thou mayeat dig
When thou but eaten and art full,
Then thou shalt bl- the I.ord thy God,
For :n':..f.'od land that He hath given
The recundity of this land was
owing, natura.lista have 88id, to "seve-
ral circumstances: such as, the excel-
lent temperature of the air, which was
never subject to exceaaive heat or
cold; the regularity of the seuons,
especially the former and latter rain;
and the natural fatneaa and fertility
of the soil, which required no manur-
ing. It was famous for its large and
delicious grapes ; for its palm-trees
and dates; and for its balaam-ahrubs,
which produced the celebrated balm
of Gilead; for the constant verdure of
itsfruit..trees,-its citrons,and oranges.
Ita vines yielded grapes twice, and
sometimes thrice, in the year. Its
honey was abundant. Its inhabitants
cultivated sngar-ca.nes with great as-
siduity: their cotton, hemp, and flax,
were mostly of their own growth, and
manufacture. Its vicinity to Lebanon,
afforded them an ample supply of ce-
dar, cypreaaes, and other stately and
fragrant trees. They fed large herds
of cattle, and flocks of sheep; and
their hilly country afforded them, not
only variety and plenty of pasture,
but also abundance of water, which
descended thence into the valleys and
lowlands, which it fertilized. They
had plenty offish; and they had salt,
which Galen affirms to have been pre-
ferable to any other. The fecundity
of Palestine has been extolled, even
by,Juliantheapostate; whofrequently,
in his epistles, mentions the perpe-
tuity, excellence, and abundance, of
its fruits and produce."
Such was the land, even after it
had lost the bloom of Eden; bu' now,
the visible effects of the divine dis-
pleasure have been so long upon that
interesting country, that the far
greater part of it is reduced to a mere
desert; and the author who supplies
the foregoing description, concludes by
saying, " If we were to judge by its
present appearance, nature itself has
rendered it incapable of cultivation."
This is exactly correspondent to v.·hat
was prophesied would be the case,
during .the ecattering of the holy
people. Lev. xrri. 43:-
.. The land aloo aball be left ot them,
And shall enjoy her aabbatha
While abe Uetb desolate without them."
Immediately before this, (v. 42) the
Lord hath 88id,
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
J'1JTUlUI CIUNGU I1f TIIB LAND 01' IIBABL.
" Then will I remember my covenant with
Jacob,
And alao my covenant with Ioaac,
.And also my covenant with .Abraham will
I remeiLber:
And I will remember the land.•
Then ahall that land, which hath in-
deed been made utterly desolate, be
again, and far more abundantly, found
blooming with beauty and teeming
with plenty. When the Lord will
have mercy upon the land, one of the
principal means of his blessing it,
would seem to be his cleaving it with
rivera: and these ahall be preceded by
an earthquake, " such as was not
since men were upon the earth, so
mighty an earthquake, and so great."
And this ahall be upon the approaching
restoration of the people to the land,-
when it has again been carefully cul-
tivated, and rendered fruitful, far be-
yond what it now is. Then will the
King of the North, having gathered
to him many natiOWI, come up to
make a prey of them. In Zeoh. xiv.
2--4, we are told that " all nations
will be gathered against Jerusalem
to battle." To distinguish this siege
from the former, when Jerusa-
lem was entirely destroyed, it is
added:-
"The city abaU be taken, and the bouaea
rifled, and the women ravished, and half
of tbe city oball go furtb into captivity, and
the residue of the people shall "OT be cut
olf frum tbe city. ·Tbeo shall tbe Lord go
forth, and fight against those oations, u
when he fought in tbe day of battle. And
hia feet ahall stand in that da7 upoD the
Mount of Olivea.•
And, that we may be at no loss to
ascertain what locality is here meant,
it is particularly described, as being
that very Mount of Olives,-
" Which Is before .feruaalem. on tl-.e
eut, and the Mount oC Olivea ohall cleave
in the midst thereof; towards the eut, and
towarcll the west, a very great valley ; and
hal( of the mountain ohaU remove towardo
the north, and half of It towards the
aouth."
The cause of this is adverted to, as
being a literal earthquake, such as
the Jews had previously experienced
in the days of King Uzziah. This
earthquake, alihough disli.strous to
the enemy, shall be the cause of bless-
ing to Israel. The land, it would
seem, is to be lift.ed up, and the valley
into which the Mount of Olives had
been rent, is to be the bed of the
river, which, like that of Eden, is to
go forth eastward, to water the Gar-
den of God. Thus it is said (verses
8-10):-
"Anditaball be In that day, that lrriog
(or running waten) shall go out Crom .fe-
ruoalem; half ofthem towards the former
aea : (IJI ~rog 111 1M fJtJI/q ldlllllard,)
aad balf of them towards the binder aea;
(or MlldiUrraruaro; t11Uit11ard) in aummer
and in winter ahall it be. And the Lord
shall be Kin~ over all the earth : In that
day ahall there be one Lord, and his name
one. AU the land shall be torned ao a
plain, from Geba to Rimmon, aouth of .fe-
ruaalem: aad It shall be lifted up, and
inhabited in her place.•
This lli\ing up will,doubtlese,conduce,
of itself, to lif\ the land out of its
burning barrenness, into a tempera-
ture more conducive to health. ·\
" And there shall be no more utter'de-
struction, but Jeruaalem ahaU be aafel)'
inhabited.·-· II.
The same matterS, which are thus
clearly expressed by Zechariah, are
also explicitly foretold by Joel, in the
end of his prophecy, iii. 9-18:-
" Assemble younelveo, and come all ye
heathen, and gather yourselves together
round about: thither cauoe thy mighty
ones to come down, 0 Lord, let the heathen
be wakened, and come up to the vaUey
of .fehoahaphat, (tDhich '"'""" the Lord
shall Judge,) Cor there will 1 sit to Judge all
the heathen round about."-v. II, 12.
-The valley of Jehoshaphat, it may
be observed, lies between the Mount
of Olives and Jerusalem; and is thus
the more immediate scene of that aw-
ful convulsion intimated in Zechariah,
and in which the Moun$ of Olives is
to be cleO; in twain. Then are the
wicked, as it were, cut down, and
thrown into the great wine-press of
the wrathofGod:-(11. 13-18.)

And all the rivera of Judah ohall11ow with

And ohall water the valley of Bhittim."
The 8&1Ile river, and the pa.rsdiBai-
cal character of ita banks, are &till
more minutely described, in Ezekiel,
xlvii;---il8 the preceding events, con-
nected with the destruction of the
King of the North and all his multi-
tude, at the time of the great earth-
quake, andgrand deliverance oflsmel,
are described in :xnvili. 20; 21, and
x:xxix. 21, 22:-
~ All the men that are uponthe faee ofthe
earth,
Shall shake at my preoence,
And the mountain• ahall be thrown down,
And the oteep placeo ohall fall,
And every wall ohall fall to the ground.
And I will call for a oword agalnot him,
Throughout all my mountaino, oaith the
Lord God:
Every man's oword ohall he agalnat hlo

" And· l will aet m7 glory among the

And all the heathen shall oee
My judgment, that Tha•e executed,
And my hand that 1 have laid upon them.
So the houoe of hrael shall know
That 1 am the Lord, their God,
Prom that day, and forward."
The 8&1Ile things are frequently ad-
verted to in lsaiah,-as in ch. XXX,
25,26:-
.. And there ohall he npon nery high
mountain,
And upon eoery high hill, ·
RiYen and stream• of water,
In the day of the great alaughter,
When the towers fall."
-Here it is added, that a wonderful
change shall also take place in the at-
mosphere, so that,-
" The light of the moon ohall be u !he
light of the run,
And the light of the IUD he oe•onfold,
Ao the light ohe•en dayo,
In the day that the Lord bindeth np the
breach of his people,
And healeth the otroke of their wonnd."
So also, speaking of the great deli-
verance of Israel,it is said,(ch. xxxiii.
20, 21):-
.. Look upon Zion I
Tho city of our oolemnitieo;
Thine eyeo ohall oee Jeruoalem a quiet
habitation,
A tabernacle that shall nothe taken down:
Not one of the otakea thereof ohall ever be
removed,
Neither shall any of the cordo thereof be
broken.
But there the glorious Lord...unto uo,
A place or broad riven--atream1,
Wherein ohall go no galley with oara,
Neither shall gallant ship pau thereby:
For the Lord ie our Judge,
The Lord il our Lawgiver,
The Lord io our King:
He will I&Vft u1."
Israel, as having been sojourning in
these maritime parts, have been the
better prepared for enjoying their own
land, when it shall be made " a place
of broad rivers and streams." There,
however, their ships of war will not
be required: the Lord will be their
sure defence, so that they may, with-
out hesitation or reserve, devote their
whole energies to the furtherance of
peace and diffusion of blessing.
The 8&1Ile things are frequently ad-
verted to in the book of Psalms.
Thus, in Psalm xlvi.-aftw describing
the great earthquake, by which the
mountains are "carried into the midst
of the sea," and during which, " the
God of Jacob" is found a sure Refuge
for his people,-the discovery of bless-
ing is made:-
" A river I the streams wl1ereof shall
make glad tho city of God, the holy place
ofthe tabernacles ofthe Moat High."
The destruction of the enemy, and
consequent deliverance and peace of
Israel, are in the same Psalm de-
scribed as taking place at that time.

These are the times when refreshing
shall come from the presence of the

of all things, which God hath spoken
by the mouth of all his holy prophets,
since the world hega.n."-Acts, iii. 21.
Thus shall abundant room and pro-

In this land was Adam, in inno-
cence, placed; and Israel, when holi-
ne88 to the Lord. In this land did
both Adam and Israel break the cove-
nant, whereby they held po8888sion of
the land; and thence were they both
driven to till the common ground:
and because of the sin of the one, and
of the other, hath the C1ll'8e devoured
the earth. But in this very land did
the Prince of Glory condescend to
hear the shame; and in this very land
shall he occasionally condescend to
bear the glory, and to sway his scep-
tre over the renewed earth, - the
world,-the universe. As yet shall be
accomplished that which is written;
Is. ii 2--5--
" And It lhall come to pua In the Jut

When the restitution of all things,
to the state they were in Eden, shall
take place, then shall Israel, through
the 8&nle redeeming love, whereby the
outward blessings have been recovered,
be given an inward beauty and moral
fruitfulness, correspondent to the good-
ne88 which the Lord will then mani-
fest, to the mountains and plains, the

which had been promised to the fa--

given, in everlasting po88688ion." -

WE are apt to look upon the terms
earth and world as exactly synony-
mous. They appear, however, to have
a oonsiderable distinction of meaning,
in several parts of Scripture. The
Hebrew term earth, or land, ~.
from which, it is like!y, our word earllJ
is derived, seems to be more specially
applied to that distinguished portion
of the globe, which is so much the
subject of promise. The term toOrld
seems not to be so applied, except when
the other parts of the globe are meant
also to be included. The two are
distinguished, both as to creation and
redemption. In Psalm xc. 2, God is
said to have " formed the earth and
the world." And in Psalm xxiv. refer-
ring to the Lord's return, when He
comes to claim his own, it is said
"the earth is the Lord's,and the fnlness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell

therein." It is upon the earth, more
espeei&lly, that the physical changes
are to take place, preparatory to the
establishment of the millennial king-
dom, as is intimated, Is. xxiv. The
earth, or land, will be dreadfully con-
vulsed; after which the dry deserts will
be fonnd well watered, and blooming
with perennial beauty. At the close
of the Millennium, not only shall the
barren land have been thus recovered
from barrenne88, but great revolutions
having also occurred in the world
abroad, the very sea will be made to
give way to scenes of greater beauty,
and more full of goodne88 to man.
Then, as is expressed in Rev. xxi. 1,
" There shall be no more sea." It is
before that time of the world's entire
recovery, and at the commencement of
the Millennium, that the land ofIsrael
is to be so entirely changed. This
change, it is intimated, Heb. xi. 8-16.
was clearly understood by the Patri-
archs. Abraham is there said to have
been called to " go out into a place,
which he should a.fterwa,rd6 receive
for an inheritance." And "he so-
journed in the land of promise, as in
a strange country." It was indeed
the land of promise,-the land which
he should afterwards receive for an
inheritance: but the time was not yet
come for the possession. It was, as
yet, to them, only as a strange country,
wherein they, at that time, sought no
permanent dwelling: but there Abra-
ham, with Isaac and Jacob, heirs ofthe
, same promise, dwelt only in tab_er-
nacles. Abraham looked for somethmg
further than was yet in the land : " He
looked for a city, which hath founda-
tions,whose builder andmaker is God."
These Patriarchs, it is expressly said,
" all died in faith, not having received
the promises, but having seen them
afar off; and were persuaded of, and
embraced them, and confessed that
they were strangers and pilgrims on
the earth. For they that say such
things, declare plainly, that they seek
a country." They looked for a more
blessed state of things than was then
to be enjoyed. They looked for the
land as it shall be, when the will of
God shall be done on earth, as it is in
heaven. They desired a better coun-
try; that is, a heavenly: wherefore
God is not ashamed to be called their
God, as if he had failed in his promise
to them; but, even after they were
dead, without having received the
promises, God stills calls himself their
God,-the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob: and why? because He will
perform to them the promises. " He
hath prepared for them a oity,"-the
New Jerusalem, that cometh down
from God out of heaven; and which
shall be the heavenly seat ofdominion
under the whole heaven. Then shall
Abraham be found the heir, not merely
of the land, but of the world. The
promise of the land may, indeed, be
said to imply that of the world; just
as the possession of a throne implies
the possession of the empire over
which the throne is placed.
It is rather remarkable, tbat a spot
so eminently fitted for being the
throne of universal empire, as is this
land, should yet never have been oc-
cupied, as such, by any of the great
powers that, since .the rise of the .AP.-
syrian empire, have aimed at the sove-
reignty of the world. It is true that
these three great states of ancient
times, Tyre, Egypt, and Assyria, were
on its several bounds: but the eli-
gi'bility of the land itself seems not to
have been observed. The A88yrian,
with a force like that of his mighty
river, swept over it, carrying away the
house of Israel captive, and threat-
ening also the destruction of Judah :
but he stayed not in the land. He
left only the wreck ofsome conquered
nations, in the room of captive Israel.
The Babylonian came next, and com-
pleted the removal of the people of
promise, by taking away Judah also:
but he seems not to have thought of
occupying this glorious position, from
which to i88Ue his arbitrary mandates
to all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell upon the faceofall the earth.
The Medes and Persians next bore

that they were thus parting with the
throne of the world. The Macedonian
conqueror passed over the land, u one
not knowing its value; and took up
his abode in Babylon, which wu to
be destroyed. Three ofthe great king-
doiD8, into which his empire was di-
' vided, bordered upon this land; north,
south, and east. Still the throne of
the earth was left comparatively
empty: but much disturbed by two
of these,-Egypt on the one hand, and
Syria on the other. The Romans came
next, throwing their covering wings
overtheoppreesed Jews; and,atlength,
filling with deeolation the land of
Immanuel: bnt they thought not of
making this the throne of their glory;
although, ultimately, they removed
the chiefseat of their empire eastward,
as far u Byzantium. These, the
Macedonians and the Romans, as com-
ing by sea, and drawing the people
out towards them, seem to have been
the fishers, that it was prophesied (Jer.
xvi. 16) would fish Israel out of their
land. Afterwards came the hunters,
who were to hunt them. These were
the Arabians, or Saracens, on the oae
hand, and the Turks on the other.
The former swept over the land
from south to north; and, northward
of the land, erected some principal
seats oftheir empire, as in Bagdad and
Aleppo. The Turks hunted from east
to west, as far as Couatantinople,
anciently Byzantium, where they
erected the throne of that empire,
which is now tottering to its fall.
It is remarkable, that although all
these nations have in their turn trod
Jerusalem under foot; and have, in all
directions, swept over the Ian~ to
further conque•ts, yet none of them
have iD truth enjoyed the land: and
it is as mnarkable, that the ouly king-
dom of Jerusalem which has been at
all set up, since the expulsion of the
Jews, is that of the Franks, at the
time of the Crusades : - the ouly
enterprise in which all the western D&-
tions evel' fully united. The land
however was not then prepared for

They will again go up to take

North will come np to contend with
them for this throne of 1lllive1'811
sovereignty; and will seek to make a
prey of them, when they are there
gathered with their treasures, out of
many oonntrie&.-Ezek. xxxviii. By
its being said in Daniel, (xi. 45,) that
" he shall plant the tabernacles of his
palaces, between the seas, in the glo-
rious holy mountain," it would seem
that he will have perceived the
eligibility of that land, as so beauti-
fully seated between the seas, and 118
supplying such facilities for building;
and will be making preparations for
the erecting there a splendid metro-
polis for the immense empire he shall
then have acquired; u having swept
away the Turk, and overthrown the
.King of the South; and united Persia,
Ethiopia, and Libya, with his many
bands from the North quarters. But,
as has been described by so Dl&IIY of
the prophets of Israel, " he shall come
to his end, and none shall help him."
The land shall be kept for the people
to whom it was promised mthe days
of old; and who have been ever in
training to become a nation of kings
and priests unto God.
The promise of the Land to a
peculiar people, is one of the first and
surest things with which we are made
acquainted in the Scriptures of tmth.
And in order clearly to understand
our subject, it would be better, before
going farther, briefly to eonsider the
ptomises made unto the fathers on
this subject: and it is worthy of re-
mark that these promises, especially
those to Abraham, were promises, pro-
perly such; and not conditional upon
man's part, u were those afterwards
made with the nation of Israel, upon
their going to take temporary pos-
session of the land. That temporary
po8118ssion of the land they received
upon the terms of a covenant which
they afterwards. broke. Thus did
they forfeit their right to the posses-
sion, and so were removed out of the

iDheritance..As11181'kiugtbisdistinction,
the apo&Ue very beautifully argues,
(Rom. iv. 13-18,} "The promise
that he ( t.W u, .Abralulm) ahould be
the heir of the world, was not to ·
Abraham, or to his aeed, through the
law, but through the righteousness of
faith. For if they whioh are of the
law be heirs, faith is made void, and
the promise made of none effect."
WhyP Because the law hath utterly
failed ofseouriDg the heirship to Israel.
In place of doing this, " It worketh
wrath, for where no law is, there is no
transgression. Therefore it is offaith,
that it might be by grace, to the end
the promise might be 11111'9 to all the
.-d.: not to that only which is of the
law," (suoh as the Jews, who still re-
tained the Mosaic ritual,) " but to
that alao, whioh is of the faith of
Abraham:" who was justified bY. a
faith whioh he had before circum-
cision. The main portion ofAbraham's
descendants, of the house of Israel,
who had been then seven hundred
years out of the land, were already
in ciroumsta.nces similar to his, and
in uncireumcision were growing up in-
to the promised multitude of nations.
And so the Apostle here takes notice
ofits being said to Abraham, " I heve
made thee a father of many nations."
He is the father of us all, befure Kem,
whom he believed; although, to the
view of man, the literal accompliah-
ment of the prophecy has not taken
place. Israel, or Ephraim, the seed
of Abraham, of whom the promised
multitude of nations was emphatically
to come, has been lloC0011Ilted dead, or
not existent; but God " quickeneth
the dead, and calleth those things that
be not, u though they were." .Abra-
ham, " against hope, believed in hope,
that he might become the father of
many nations, according to that whioh
was spoken, So ahaU thy seed be,"
that is, " as the stars of heaven for
multitude." And that this was spoken
of the multitude of a natural seed,
even as contrasted with an adopted,
we ahaU presently see. The promises
made to the fathers, with respect to
the heirship of the world, are thus
[LBc. m.
recognized in the New Testament u
still standing; and they are sure to
all the seed of Abraham, having mith
in the promised MeNial!, whether they
belongtothe circumcisionor nncireum-
cision, to the J ewe within the wall of
sepa.ration, and as well to the branchea
of Joseph which have run over the ,
wall. The bleaaing is still more
directly to Israel; and, through them,
to other nations. Our busineas, thero-
be, is still with the promises made
unto the fathers, Abraham, haac, and
Jacob.
The first of th- promises, to whioh
we refer, is recorded Gen. xii. 1-3:-
"Now tbe Lord had oaldUD!o Abram, Get
thee Ollt or th:r oounlrf, and from th:r kin-
dred, and Crom thy father'• houoe, unto &
landthat I willlhow thee, and I will make
of thee a great nation."
-This seems to refer to the ultimate
fulfilment of the promise, "when shall
be gathered into one nation, all the
children of God, that are soattered
abroad;"-
" And I will bl- thee, and make thy
name e.aaAT;"
-Suoh was the meaning of the name
whioh he then bore: Abram,--great,
or high father, or Father of the High
One:-
" And thou lhalt he a bleoling : and I will
ble11 them that blell thee, and curse him
that ouneth thee : and In thee shall all
tho families of the earth be bleoaecl."
The seed of Abram were thus to
have an intimate, powerful, and, ulti-
matelY, a most beneficial inHuence
upon all the families of mankind.
Othernationswereto beblesaedthrough
their instrumentality. Those who
refnsed participation in their bleaaiDga;
would wither away before them: and
their commission to bleBB extended to
all the families of the earth. This is
their calling from the beginning; and
of which, He who knows the end, from
the beginning, will not repent. Abra-
ham obeyed the call of Jehovah, and
cameintothelandofCanaan;(ver. 7):-

Here the promise ia full and free. It
ia a gift of the land, before the law was
given; and even before cironmcision;
and therefore altogetherunconditional.
It may also be obeerved, that the pro-
miseofthe land ia intimatelyconnected
with the former promise, that in hia
seed " all the families of mankind
were to be blessed,"-the land being
the most advantageous position from
which streams of blessing could be
diffiued over all the world.
There may be some diepute as to
what ia meant by the seed of Abraham
~ spoken of. Is it an individnal,
or many? Is it an adopted, or a
natural posterity? It means One.
Thia ia plainly decl&red, Gal. iii. 16,
" Now to Abraham and to his seed
were the promisee made. He IIIith
not, And to seeds, as of many; but as
af One, And to thy seed, which is
Christ." It was Christ, then, to whom
the land was promised. He is the
Head, and only in him can the inherit-
ance be enjoyed; none can.~ into
the poueBIIion, except as bemg Vlewed
in Him. "Thou art worthy," sing the
four livingcreatures, and twice twelve
elden, Rev. v. 8, 9. Ht onlf ia worthy
to claim the inheritance, having truly
acted the part ofa kinsman Redeem~r:
but He does not retain the po81189810n
to himeelfalone, the sole inhabitant of
the land.-No, although it ia to OrM
that the land is given, yet many come
into the enjoyment of it through that
One. And, accordiugly, the song coD-
eludes thus:-
" Thou hast made ua unto our God, kings
and prleau : and wa lhall aarow ow TH&
•Aa'l'a.•
By this eeed, therefore, ia meant One,
Christ· to whom the land is absolutely
given;' and in wh~ right ~ multi-
tudinous seed come mto the enJoyment
of it.
The question then comes to be,
whether this multitudinous eeed,
viewed in the One seed, Christ, ia the
natural posterity of Abraham; or
02
merely an adopted family, Bot the
natural descendantsofAbraham? The
oircnmstances of Abrah&m at the time
of receiving the promise, eeemed to
offer nothing but an adopted heir.
The doubt, however, ia resolved tbr
him, Gen. xv. He had t.&n ocm-
plaining that no' a BOD of bia own;
but that merely one born in bia house,
was to be his heir. The Lord an-
ewers, (verses 4, ll):-
" Thla ohallDot be thia• heir; but he tha&
lhall eome forth out of thine OWJl bowelt
lhall be thine laeir. And He brought him
forth abroad, an4 said, Loolt DOW toward
heaven, and tell the otara Ifthou be able
to number them: and Hal&id unlo hlm,
8o lha1l thy oeed be."
Here the Lord evidently diatinguiJ&es
between a natural and merely an
adopted eeedj and, at the eame time,
~8 of tile natural, .. beiu«
undoubtedly that which was spoken
of. He undoubtedly, points to the
multiplicity of the ~ u in coDtrui
to mere hnman expectation, at the
time. It is added, " And he believed
in the Lord, and it was IIOOOUilted unto
him for righteoumese." He looked
forward to the promised inheritance,
through the right ofthe OrM promised
eeed, through whom alone, either he
or any of his nnmerous progeny, could
come into the promised possession;
and he stood accepted in Him, whose
day he saw afar off, and aeeingwhich,
he rejoioed. .
A further diatinotion, u to the.-,
ia made in Gen. xvii. where the multi-
plicity of the seed is particularly dwelt
upon, (venee3-6):-
"And Abram r.,u ea hla taoe; and Go<!
talked with him, oayl,., Allor me, behold
my eovenant Ia with the•, and thou lhalt
be a father ormany nation&; Neither ohaU
thy name be any more eallad Abram, "boa&
thy name ahall be Abraham; for a lather
oC MAllY nationo have I made thee. And
I will make thee exceedingly fruitful; ,ml
I will make naliona of thaa, and ltiagt
aball ooma out ofthee.''
And then, with regard to the continu-
ance of GOO's favour towards the
posterity of Abl"lllll, (vene 7):-

u And I will ettabllah my co•enimtbetween
me and tbee, and tby aeecl after thee, In
tbeir generation•, for an enrlutlng con-
nant, to be a Goclnnto tbee, and to tby
Med after tlaee."
And then God having, through all
their changes, followed them with
his everlasting love, brings them, al;
last, into the promiaed inheritance,-
("· 8) " And I will gbe ute tbee, and uto
tby aeed after tbee, tbe land wherein tbon
art aatranger; all tbe land of Canaan, for
an everlutlng po11eoalon; and I will be
tbelr God."
Now, the question is, Was this
numeroue posterity, with whom the
Lord was to be always; and who would
ultimately, be given possession of the
land: was it to come of Ishmael, who
had already been born to Abraham,
and whose posterityis now known to be
extremely numerous, and may be said
tohavelonghad actual possessionofthe
land? Abraham, himself, seems tohave
had scarcely any other expectation;
but, whalo saith God? (verses 19, 21):
"Sarah, tby wil'e, ohall bear thee a 1011
Indeed, and tbou abalt call hla name II&IIC;
I will eatabllab m:r covenant wltb him, for
an everlutlng covenant. and wltb bia aeed
after him. My covenant will I eotabllab
witb laaae, wbom Sarah ohall bear 11Dto
tbee at tbla aet time In tbe next ye~.•
Thus explicit is the word ofpromise,
with regard to the many nations to
come;-not of Ishmael, however nu-
merou his posterity unght be, but of
thai; very son Isaac, which should be
born of his wife Sarah, the following
year. And the name of Sarai, my lady,
is changed to Sarah, the lady, as if she
would be the mother, in common, of
those who should inherit the promises:
as Abram is changed to Abraham, the
father of a multitude,-6 multitude of
nations.
Thalo these promises may be made
do'ubly sure, God confirms them with
an oath, in Gen. :uii. 16-18,-
Abraham having, in purpose, offered
up his son lsaac-6 type ofthe offering
up of the Son of God, the Heir of the
promises; and whereby they all are
confirmed: for " Christ was a minister
of the circumcision, for the truth of
God, to confirm the promises made
unto the fathers," Rom. xv. 8. If God
hath not withheld his own Son, but
hath freely given him up for us ,all,
how shall he not with him freely give
ns all things? Abraham having pre-
sented the type of this SBCrifice, the
God of Tm~ then condescends to
addresa him thus:-
" By myaelfhan I awom, aaltb tbe Lord,
that In bleaolng I will ble11 tbee, and in
multiplying I will multiply tby aeecl u tbe
atan of beano, and aa tbe aand wblch Ia
npon tbe aea-ohore : and tby aeetl ahall
po11011 tbe gate ofhllenemiea; and In tby
oeed ahall all tbe nation• of the earth be
bleaaed."
Here, then, the three birthright
blessings are distinctly promised to
Abraham: These are, the multiplicity
or double portion; the kingship or
place of rule; and the priesthood or
being made the medium of blessing.
The double portion seems to be expres-
sed in the first of these promises,
which speaks of the immense multi-
plicity of the race; and the language
in which the promise is conveyed,
seems to intimate that they would
Jl088888 both the more elevated portions
of the earth, and also the sea-shore:
and their own land is one in which they
may indeed most eligibly possess this
double portion,-it being the most
centrally placed with regard to both
land and water.
The second ofthese promisesregards
theplace ofnd&-the kingship: which
is expressed by its being said thai; they
should po88888 " the gate of their
enemies." It was in the gates, of old,
that the people held their counsels,
and that rule was exercised. To
po88888 the gate of the enemy, was
the same with overturning his counsels
and possessing his power. Now it
may be observed thai; it was from the
North, that the great enemies of Israel
proceeded: the Babylonian, Median,
Greek, and Roman, all proceeded from
the North. These were the empires
that composed the great image de-

ICribed in Daniel, chap.ii as well as the
Assyrian, who had previously ravaged
the land, and led away the main
portion of the people into the north
country;-where they have multiplied
as promiBed; and where they were
giftn poeaesaion of the gate of their
enemies; and have gone out by it,
unto all parts of the world.
The third promise regards the
priut/wod. This eeed, promiBed to
Abraham, are to be made the means
of conveying blessing unto all the
~tiona of the earth. This is emphat-
lcally true of Christ; but it is also true
of the other seed ofAbraham, who are
heirs, together withHim,ofthepromise.
Already have these nations, who so
wonderfully multiplied in the north,
and who have been already given-
so far, the gate pf their enemy;-
already are they made the instru-
ments of conveying the glorious
gospel of the grace of God unto almost
all the ends ofthe earth. All blessings
are, in the first instance, put into their
hands; and, through them, are these
widely distributed among the nations.
True, the cbildren of Belial are here
also, and try to mar this ministration
of blessing; but still it is through
Iarael that the blessing is conveyed•
and this, we are given to hope, will
yet be much more abundant.
These three promises were written
in the names of the three great re-
ceivers of the promisee. The first
referring to their multiplicity, is wri~
ten in the name of Abraham,-the
father of a great multitude, who had
also been called Abram, or high fa-
ther. The second promise, regarding
the supplanting, and the possession of
power, is written in the name of his
grandson, Jacob, a supplanter ; and
Israel, prince of God, or great prince.
And the third promise, regarding the
communication of blessing, the making
known the good ti~ of great joy
unto all people, is expressed in the
name of Abraham's own son, IBB&C-
that is, laughter: at whose birth hls
mother said,-" God hath made me
to laugh, so that all that hear will
laugh with me."
To Isaac the promises were oon-
firmed, which had been thus so un-
equivocally given to Abraham, Gen.
xxvi. 2---4:-
" Aad the Lord appeared auto laim, aad
aald, Go not down Into Bgypt; dwell
In the.land that I ahall tell thee of. So-
jonrn tn thla !aDd, and I will be with thee,
&nd I wUI bleaa thee ; for unto thee, and
unto thy Hed, I will give all th- coun-
trlea. And I will perform the oath which
I aware unto Abraham, thy father ; and 1
will make thyaeed to multiply u the atara
of heaven, and will sive auto th'laeed aU
theae countrlea ; and ill thy aee ahaU aU
the nationa otthe earth be hleued.•
Here, again, the multiplicity, the do-
minion, and the power of blessing are
spoken of ; and are expressly con-
nected with the seed of Abraham, in
the line of Isaac.
But Isaac had two sons, both of the
same mother, and bom at the same
time. Which of these was heir of the
promises? Neither are we here let\
in doubt. Even before they were
hom, the blessing was promiBed to
Jll80b. Isaac wished to have the bless-
ing conveyed to Esau, in preference:
but his purpose was Oftrruled; and
the blessing, at\er all, descended upon
the cbild of promise, although by
means which we cannot approve. It
is a wonderful example of divine faith-
fulness, triumphing over human infi-
delity,-of Isaac to his God,-of
Rebekah to her husband,-of Jacob
to his brother. Jacob seems to be a
type of the supplanting seed of Abra-
ham, who have come into the posses-
sion of blessing, meant of God for
them; but, by the human bestowers,
for another. And this is the bless-
ing wherewith Isaac blessed Jacob,
supposing him to be Esau, (Gen. ch.
xxvii ll8, 29):-
" God give thee of the dew of heaven,
and the tatneao of the earth, and plenty of
corn and wine. Let people serve thee, and
nadona bow down to thee. Be lord ovar
thy brethren, and let thy mother'• oona
bow down to thee. Cuned be every one
that euneth thee, aad bleuad be he that
bleaaeth thee.•

ctiatinetly given to Jacob's posterity,
even as diatinguished from that of his
OWJI twin brother, Eaau.
In Gen. xxvili. 12-15, the pro-
mises which had been made to the fa-
there, Abraham and Isaac, and which
had been nnintentionally conveyed to
Jacob, are all conJirmed to the latter,
in a vision which he had of the glori-
one kingdom of the Meeaiah; to which
onr Savionr seems to allude, when-
speaking with Nathaniel, who had
made oonfeeaion of his being the king
of Israel-he eaye, " Hereafter sheJl
ye see heaven opened, and the angels
of God ascending and descending upon
the Son of mAll." Here it is said, that
Jacob, having lighted on a certain
place, took a stone for his pillow, and
laid him down to sleep:-
" ADd he dnamecl, and, behold, a ladder
••t upon tile earth; ud the top ot ·It
reached to heann; and behold the angela
ot God ascending and descending on it.
ADd behold, the Lord stood abo•e it, and
he 1aid, I am the Lord God or Abrebam
thy father, and the God of laaac; the land
whereon thou llest, to thee will I r·veIt,
and to thy seed, ud thy seed shal be u
the dGit ot the earth ; and thou shalt
1preadabroad, to the weat, and to the east,
and to the north, and to tho aoath."
Now this is the very order in which
we suppose the seed of lerael to have
spread; first to the west, and then,
latterly, to the east; first to the north,
and now emphatice.lly to the south.
And now seems to be dawning, that
which is here again said, " And in
thee, and in thy seed, sheJl all the fa-
milies of the earth be blessed." And
then, with regard to the good provi-
dence of God, until all these things
should be accomplished, (verse 15):-
" And, behold, I am with thee, and will
keep thee in all placea whitbor thou goeat,
and will brlngtheeagain into this land, for
I will not leave thee, until I have done
that which I have apoken to thee ot.•
-Notwithstanding all appearances,
we believe that God has been tme to
his promise, in making lerael the ob-
ject of his peculiar care. He will
never leave them until the kingdom
of grace be conSUDIDIAted in glory.
At the same~'(Bethel, or houea
of God,) the Lord met with Jacob,
upon his retnrn from the north coun-
try, where he had served for a wife,
(Gen. XXXV. 9-12):-
" And God appeared unto Jacob, wben
he came out ot Padan-aram, and blaaad
him. And God oaid unto him, Thy name
1a Jacob; thy namv ahall not any more be
called Jacob, butlarael (or Prl•c•ofGod)
ahall be thy name: and hecalleclhianame
Iarael. And God said unto him, I am Ovd
Almighty."
It is when Israel returns with his
numerous posterity, that the kingdom
under the whole heaven shall be given
them. It is then, when God has been
enquired at to do for them what he
hath promised ; when they have
wrestled to obtain the blessing, that
they shall, indeed, in fulness, be made
princes of all the earth. And God
condescends to pledgehis Great Name,
th,.t He will accomplish these pro-
mises He has now written in the names
of the three great receivers of the pro-
mises. And he adds,-
" Be trnltful, and multiply ; a nation,
aJI.da company of natlona, ahsll lie ot thee,
and kiDga shall oome out or thy loins, and
the land which I gave Abraham and Iaaao,
to thee will I ghe it, and to thy seecl after
thee will I g!Ye the laad."
But Jacob had a number of .eons,
twelve in all: To which of them were
the birthright promises made ?-Or
were they all made alike to all ?
They belonged to Reuben, the first-
born ; but they were taken from him,
and distn'buted among three of his
brethren. The prieethood was given
to Levi. The kingship to Judah: his
mother's children were to bow down
to him.-Of him, acco~ to the
flesh, came Christ, to whom every knee
sheJl bow. The double portion, the
multiplicity, waagiven to Joseph. The
very name of Joseph means increase;
and there is abundant reference to the
increase, both as to the number of his
posterity, and the amplitude of their
possessions, in the blesaing which Ja-
cob pronounced upon J01eph, as re-

The expression nsed in the lastpart
of the blessing, it ie noted, implies that
they would grow, tu fohu do incretue
-«ndiug off shoals, as has been the
case with regard to both the figure,
and the people spoken of, in the north
country. Thus worthy would they be
of the name of their father, Joseph,-
addiftg or incretue. The line in which
was to come the great multiplicity, ia
still more distinctly pointed out : for,
when Joeeph perceived that his father
had croeaed hia hands, eo as to put
the right upon the head of the younger,
in place of upon Ma.nasseh, he would
have oorrected the auppoeed mistake:
bnt his father, who had evidently been
guided by inspiration, in the aet, 811
well 811 in the words, refused, 81ld said
(verse 19):-
" I bow It, my IOD, I bow It; he al10

.Are these worde all to go for
DOthing? Or is it not eo, that a mul-
titude or fulneee of nations hath come
of this eo-called lost portion of the
house of Israel ? These are fiOt mere
'idle words. And, let it be considered,
tba& a multitude ofnations cannot, in-
deed, well be hid in a corner ; nor
are they. The word, translated mul-
titude, ia aleo translated fulnees. Put
Gentllea for nations, (and the worde
are used indifferently,) and then we
have the very expression usedby Paul,

It ia not necessary that Joseph's
posterity ebould hitherto have been
known 88 Israel: Joseph waa not
known in Egypt 88 a eon of Jacob,
when the Lord made him fruitful in
a strange land. Nay, he had previ-
oualy called the name of hie firet-born,
Manaeaeh; 88 having himself/or:vo"-
all hie toil, and all hie father's bonae.
There W88 evidence, however, to
convince hia father and hie brethren
that the very Joseph found in Egypt,
waa the very Joseph who had been by
hie brethren thought loet, and by his
father believed to be dead. And there
il, 88 we &ball eee, abundant evidence
to prwe, equally, the identity of his
deeoendante, as existent in the north
country,out of which theyare 88 really
to be brought, 88 were their _
fathers
out of Egypt.
It ie remarkable that, in Rev. vii.
aft.er the sealing of the limited num-
ber from Juda, and hie companions,
we have the description of another
company, who may moet clearly be
recognized 88~eaingthethree birth-
right bleeainge, 'which we have seen
were promised to Abraham, in the
line of Isaao-and then in that of Ja-
cob-and then, more particularly 88
to the double portion, to the house of
Joseph, in the line of Ephraim, the
chiefof the tribes that have been called
loet, and which were, by the Asay:ri-
ans, carried into the same quarter from
which the modernposae880r8of Europe
havecome. First, 88 to the multiplicity
promised to Abraham, and written in
hie name: " .Aft.er this I beheld, and
lo, a great multitude, which no man
could number, of all utions, and kin-
dred&, and people, and tongues."
And, secondly, 88 to their having sup-
planted their enemies, and come into
the place of honour and power, ex-
preseed in the namee, Jacob and Israel,
it ia llllid that they " stood before the
throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robee, and palma in their
hands." They are brought near unto
the Supreme; the Source of all Bleee-
ing; and are given the tokens of vie-
tory. And then, thirdly, 88 ia promised
in the name of Ieaao, they are full
of rejoicing, and call upon all to re-
joice with them. Their song is one
of the most blessed which the heart of
man can conceive: " And cried with
a loud voice, Salvation to our God
that sitteth on the throne, and unto
the Lamb." Here are the people, pos-
eeeaing the bleeainge of the firet-born.
This seems to be, that which ia called
(Heb. xii. 23) "the general ueembly

are written in heaven." And it ia

whioh the d8108Ildanta of Ham are re-
markable, to the superior intellectaal
and moral eoll8titution poueeeed by
the original stock. .A.ftar this -uoom
among the deacendanta of Ham, they
were, aa we ahall eee, led ou muong
the more vigorous Japhetio raoe, in ~
north country, to have the needful en-
ergy giva to that intellectual power,
and thoee eent.imenta and a1Feotimu,
which they previ01111ly posseseed.
It ia a faet JIOW abulldantly ucer-
tained,-oot Ollly u to the infilrior
animals, with regard to which the priii-
ciple baa been long acted upon,-but,
aleo, it ia true with regard to the
human race;-that the dispoliticms
and attainments of the parents, have,
in many oaees, a moat important in-
fluence upon the capacity snd habits
of the offilpring. The laws which
regulate this influence, are DOt yet
clearly defined ; but there can be 110
doubt u to the genmal principle-a
';Jrinciple implied, indeed, in the very
hst truths of our religion,-in which,
tkl moral and intellectual constitution
of man ia recogniled u having been
grevoualy injured by the fall of our
full father, Adam. We must diatin-
guilh between natmal CllpiiCity, and
apecal divine grace, when we speak
of tho infltumce of parents upon their
childnn, previoua to birth. It ia of
the namol capacity and disposition of
which 1te spealt; and subordinate al-
though tlis be to the otber,-yet still
it ia of vaat importance, both u to the
.happineu of the individual, and hia
useCulness to society. Even where
the ohiWren are of the same parent,
there ia oft«~ a atrildng coincidence,
between the wying disposition of the
parent, IUld tbl permanent dispoeition
given to his ~rent oft'spri:ng. Thus,
· Iahmael, born to Abraham, after hia
oon11iet with the kings at the ftlley ot
Shaveh, baa given birth to a race de-
lighting in wv; whilst I-, barn to
Abraham in hia old age, after receiving
the benefit of hia long traiuing and dis-
cipline, manifested, exceptin one grad
instance, mliAlh of that 111bdued and
pioua character of miDd, whlch might
have been expected. .And if, u eome
have 8UppOII8Ci, the Brahmins be the
d-dants of Abraham, by Keturah,
they do remarkably manifest the aelf-
poaseaaion IIDd willingneaa to acrifice
the alfectiona, through re1igioue mo-
tives, which were so COIIIpicuoua in
Abraham, at the time of hia ofJ'eriDg
up hia son haao upon the altar. In
them the prinaiple baabeen ill-applied;
but u to the natural feeling, ii may
be regarded u the l!llllle.
Even phyScal beauty and strength
were not unattAmded to, in the choice
ar the p!'O!!ellitora of the choeen raee.
The health, both of Abraham md of
Sarah, appears to have been sound.
The ftrious journiaa of Abraham, and
the multifarious duties to which he
had to attend, must have required a
etrougphyllicaleoDStitution,-it.ndmay
also have tended to increue ii. Ilia
agility ia remarited, u in the cue of
entertaining the angeb,-and the sno-
cemhlp~tof~e~~ofhia
kin81118.11, Lot. The beauty of Sarah,
the wife of Abraham; and of Rebekah,
the beloved wife of haao; md of
Rachel, the beat beloved wife of Jacob;
ia very particalarly and ~y
noticed. And we find, u in the oue
of Joeeph, of whom the mnltitndmoua
eeed 'Wll8 to c<me, that this beauty 'Wll8
not lost to thechildren pfthesemothers
of Israel. From many parts of the
Scripturewe learn, that the daughters
of Israel were fair and comely: and
even with regar.d to the children of
Judah, whcee beauty ia not so much
spoken of u ia that of JOIIIlph, mliAlh
ia recorded.
The means takea to preeerve health
of body, and to MUOn, etrengthen,
and attune the phyaioal powers, were
ind~ remarkably adapted for the
purposes intended; and did. certainly
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
argue a full knowledge of the natural
laws, in the Guide and Lawgiver of
Israel. These, however, we do not
now dwell npon: if personal beauty,
and bodily activity and strength, were
attended to in the choice of the fathers
and mothers of this peculiar people;
much more may we expect that atten-
tionshouldbe paidtotheirminds-tothe
improvement and invigorating of their
moral and intellectnal constitution.
One of the first leesona which
Abraham had to learn, was, the proper
exercise of FaitJa-.an immediate de-
pendence upon the guidance and pro-
tection of the unaeen God. He wu
called to go out, not knowing whither
he went,-nor how he wu to be sup-
ported and preserved,--otherwise than
as the Almighty would vouchsafe.
At the same time, his H~ Wlllrbrought
into most healthful influence, by the
many preciona promises that were
given to him, with regard to his seed;
and especially with regard to Messiah's
day, which he wu permitted to see
afar off; and his possession of the land
wherein he wu a stranger; and of that
city, which hath foundatiooa, whose
BuilderandMakerisGod. His Venem-
fion wu given abundant ocoasion for
exercise, not more by the need he had
for patient submission to the will of
God, during the long delay, and the
trials which God in his sovereignty
allowed him to endure,-than by the
call for the rejoicing devotion to Him,
by whom he wu ever so signally
delivered, and so abundantly blessed.
The sentiment ofJwtice was nourished
by the sacrifices he wu enjoined to
offer, as pointing forward to the sacri-
fice of God's beloved Son, for the sins
of guilty men. And leesons of truth
were equally impressed upon him, by
his being shown the folly of duplicity,
as in the case of denying his wife; and
by his Great Teacher's so wonderfully
fulfilling his word to him. By this
divine goodne88, also, was his Benetlo-
lence instructed; and in its exercise
wu be encourageQ, by his being pri-
vileged to entertain angels unawares.
And, to crown all, he was, by his con-
stant ultimate success, after long wait-
(LEe. IV.
ing, taught patience in waiting, and
perseverance in acting-in acting as
being made of one mind with the most
high God,-who condescended to have
fellowship with him, and to call him
his friend. True dignity, and yet
humble and delighted obedience, might
therefore be expected to belong to the
character of Abraham.
At the same time, his Intellect must
have been greatly cultivated by his
being led into such a variety of scenes
and circumstances. His knowledge
of localitiu must have been greatly
enlarged, by his travels into such a
variety of countries. And his Indiftd..
uality, or power of observing and dis-
tinguishing oqjects, wu given exercise
by coming into contact with various
nations, as well as with so many in-
dividuals. The various production&
of nature, and of art, in the different
countries through which he passed,
would also help to keep this important
mental power well employed. He
must have been well acquainted with
civil alfairs,-and we see that he was
far from being unskilled in diplomacy;
nor was he uninstructed or uneucceaa-
ful in war: although, only for the sake
of peace does he seem to have turned
his attention to the sword. Astrono-
mical knowledge, it is likely, he
brought with him -from the east; and
in Damascus and Egypt, and th3
smaller states between, he had an
opportunity of being made well ec-
quainted with the arts, and their vm-
OU8 productions. In learning the "~Wys
of God, which were so unfolded to hlm,
his Cawality must have been well em-
ployed, and his Comparisrm, i:1 the
illustrating these to others, whlli com-
manding his children and hishouehold
after him, that they should keep the
way of the Lord, to do jwtice and
judgment. His powers of in;elligence
and reflection, no less than lhe higher
sentiments, must, by all this, have
become greatly cultivat.OC. All this
training seems to have OO,n, not alone
for his own advantage, but clearly,
also, for the benefit of his numerous
posterity,-on account •f which he wu
called Abraham, the father of a multi-
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
LBc. IV.)
tude; a great md migh~ nation,
through whom all the nations of the
earth were to be ble88ed. It was not
until his mind had attained that 111&-
turity, which all this training waa
calculated to afford, that to him, Isaac,
in whom hia seed was to be called,
was born.
In the case of IB&aC there seems to
have been, in maDf respects, a re~
titian of the same trialamd travels;-
the same exerciaea of faith, and hope,
and veneration, and justioe, and bene-
volence, and firmness. Many of the
-very same incidents eeem to have
happened in his case, which had oc-
curred in that of his father; and the~
fore it may be, that ltlfl8 is eaid respect-
ing him. If we may be allowed the
expression, there eeems to have bean
in him, a conning over the lessons
taught to his father. His life appeara
to have paseed in greater quietueaa;
and in a calm cultivation of personal
piety, and of the domestic alfectiona,-
until the waywardntlfl8 of hisaffections
led him to destroy that domestic peace
heseemstohave110valued,byhis endea-
vouring to thwart the purpcaes of God,
as to the bestowment of the Blessillg.
In Jacob, another useful class of
facultiea were called into play, in ad-
dition to those already mentioned in
the case ofAbraham and Isaac. These
have their organa situated on the aide
of the head, and are mainly pn«krttial.
He was early called upon to exert pru-
dence, even in the preservation of his
life from the wrath of his brother;
after he had, by stealth, procured the
bleasing. Prudence, also, he had to
exert, in the acquisition, preservation,
and ma.nagement of his p~; as
well as in the preventing of mischief
in his numerona family; or in the
assuaging of disputea when they arose.
The wisdom he was thus called upon
to exercise, was, no leBB than the vir-
tues taught his fathers, neceBB&ry to
be po88e8sed by a people who are to
.upplant every other, and be made
princes in all the earth;-justifying
their title to the two names given to
their father,-Jaoob, a mpplanter, and
Israel, ~ of God. In the case of
45
Joseph aDd his bmbren, Jehovah
eeems to have maoifellted himself leas
immediately to maD; but equally in-
structive is He, by his providence.
What a powerful leaaon of virtue
ia given in Joseph, as triumphing
over all the unkindneaa and powerful
treacheryof brethren and of atrangersI
Separated from his father's house, and
with his true origin unbown, he is
put into a position of returning good
for evil, and of being a sucoour, in
trouble, for those who had appointed
him unto death, and sold him into
bondage. His firm resistance of the
seducement& ef Bin, prepare for his
being given the oontrol of all that was
po88tlfl8ed by the most polished nation,
then in the world. At the same time
we are shown how his over-faithfulness
to Pharaoh, in making the Egyptians
become slavea for a morsel of bread, ia
rewarded upon his own posterity; who,
under the descendants of these same
Egyptians, were subjected to cruel
bondage. But God overruled this, for
good. Previoualy to this, the chosen
race had only been accustomed to pas-
tlll'llge, or tillage; but they were de-
signed toplantcitiea,and dwell in them,
and beoome more conoentrated than
could be allowed them in the pastoral
life.
The ~ or conceptive
powers, had been greatly called into
exercise, in the case of Joseph, by the
position in which he was placed in
Egypt, where 80 much depended upon
his mmagement. His power of plah-'
uing seems to have grown almost to
the degree of abuse, at the time his
brethrenarrived first inEgypt. Butnot
only was it useful that he should have
bean given much exercise of that
inventive and improving geuina, for
which his desoendants were to be 80
remarkable,-it was also requisite that
the race, generallr, should be broken
in; so as to perform the duties, and
the labours, of more settled life; and,
accordingly, they are laid hold upon
by the Egyptians, and are taught by
them those arts, which it was now
requisite for them to po88tlfl8 :-such
as the making brick, and the building

cities:-they are trained to industry
and hardship. They acquired by their
previous way oflife, a strong physical
constitution,--a.nd now it was given
abundance ofprofitable exercise : ifnot
immediately profitable to them,-yet,
certainly, to their posterity. At the
same time, their moral feelinge are
educated,bytheir becoming acquainted
with the heart of a stranger: 80 that
when given a land of their own, they
might deal with the stranger, as they
themselves would have chosen to be
dealt with, in the same situation. All
the while their patient waiting upon
God, for the accomplishment of his
promise, is put to a severe trial. At
length God makes bare his Holy arm,
and seizes upon the simplest meanB-
the rod of a shepherd-to break the
sceptre of Egypt,--a.nd clear a way
for the oppressed, through all the
difficulties wherewith they were
surrounded. They are taught the
justice, the wisdom, and the power of
Jehovah, in his l!llfely leading Israel,
his first..bom, through the deep ;
whilst the enemy sank as lead in
the mighty waters. After having
been taught all the wisdom, and made
to feel all the power of Egypt,-they
are made to see all 8UCh to be of no
avail, in contravening the purposes of
the God of Illl"BBlL
In the wilderness, we behold another
course of training commenced, con-
nected with their future desfulation.
They B1'll inatmcted in their religious,
social, and personal duties, in the moat
minute particulars. They B1'll led about,
and habituated to military discipline.
They 8l'e taught alike personal clean-
liness, and holiness of heart. They
B1'll taught to put away every thing
hurtful or unseemly, and to be con-
siderate of each other's welflll'e and
happinesa. They B1'll given a body of
political institutions, remarkably ca,I-
culated to teach them order, and train
them up for independenClr-for the
enjoyment and preservation of their
public and individual rights. They
are initiated into the forma of a
popular government; and are taught,
by the division of their nation into
tribes, the principles of the COIIfeder&-
tion ofstates. It may be observed, that
there has been, up to this time, a
gradual development of the principles
of government, according as they were
called for bythe conditionofthe people.
In the infancy of the race, wbilat they
lived as a family, under Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, the patriarchal prin-
ciple prevailed. Upon the death of
Jacob, when twelve brethren were left
pretty equal in authority, the aristocra-
tical form of goverment may be said
to have existed; and this rule,by elders,
being the heads of families, seems to
have continued till1111"81ll were brought
out into the wildemeas. In the wil-
demeBB the democratical principle was
added to their political constitution;
as we read, Dent. i. 9-18. Then were
the whole body of the people ·com-
manded to look on~ from amongthem-

They were, also, here given a body

not make those distinctions, as to clean
and unclean animals,--a.nd the differ-
ent parts of the same animal;---ea to
the different plants, an~ apices, and
ointmenta;--a.nd as to metals and
precious stones;--without becoming
extensively acquainted with natural
history. And they could not but be-
come well accustomed to chronological
and astronomical observation, by their
regularly occurring festivals. At the
same time, the acquisitions made in
Egypt were not to be lost. The per-
fection of the arts, which they had
there learned, was called for, in the
constructing of the Tabernacle, and

are taught to work for the Lord, and
to feed at his hand. At once do they
- Him as the God of on!lltion, of
providence, and of redemption; by
whom the ordinary laws of nature are
overruled, that the people he had ran-
IOined from 1the hand of the enemy,
might be delivered and IIUlltained. God
is their Lawgiver, Governor, Judge,

them, both by word, and in lively

the rock, their leader saw thus the
God oflerael paaeing by, and proclaim-
ing, " The Lord, the Lord God, mer-
ciful and gracious," which he was at
the ftm advent, in the bestowment of
hie Son, and hie Spirit: and then he ie
"long-suffering," during the back-
elidiDg and wanderings of both the
houeee of lerael; until hie second
appearing, when he &hall be seen as
" abundant in goodne&ll and truth."
The eame things were ~ in
grand -me repreM!ltation: when the
high priest, with the blood of atone-
ment, was seen entering into the moat
holy plaoe; to appear in the presence
ofGod, for the people,-who, without,
were waiting for hie second appearing;
when he came forth, not clad in plain
raiment, as before,-but clothed in
garment& of glory and beauty, to bl8118
the people in the name of the Lord.
So our Great High Priest, after haviug
entered into the holieet ofall, not made
with handa,-and not with the blood
of others, but with hie own blood,-
thongh now gone to app8lll' in the pre-
sence of God for us, will-to thoee
that look for him, appear the second
time in glory and in ma,jeaty,-f'ally
to bestow the bl8118ing he hath gone
to procure. The power of tracing
analogiea,-eo essential to them as the
intended instructors of mankind,-
waa given thus the highest cul-
tivation. And the whole of their
re~ faculties were brought into
healthful exeroiae upon all thet the
Lord had done, 'W1IS doing, and would
do with them. They are taught the
origin of the world, and the past hie-
tory of man, to eee sin as the cause
of all evil; and the goodneee of God as
the eouroe of all good to man. They
are, as it were, put to aohool, to learn
in lively emblems, the justice and the
mercy of God; and the future history
of their nation and of the world. And
their sense of propriety ie educated in
the moat profitable manner, by the
minute attention they are taught to
pay to the holy service of religion,

pass aea and land for the extension
of the divine goodneaa among men;
and the bringing all parts of the
world into one grand interchange
of blessing. .And the provision
made for the cultivation ofthis mental
power ia abundantly manifest,-when,
in reading the books of Moses, we
observe the minnte attention which
was to be paid to every sort of
measurement; as in the making of the
tabernacle and its contents. It may
justly be questioned whether there be
a single profession, or trade, or art, or
Bcience, with regard to which profit
may not be derived, from the diligent
perusal, and thorough understanding
of the books of Moses. It is short of
the truth to suppose that these books
had but the inculcation of one truth
in view, however important that one
truth may be. Israel in the wilder-
ness, was in a grand course oftraining,
with regard to everything requisite;
whether belonging to their physical,
or moral, or intellectual constitution;
in order that they should be eminently
a seed to serve the Lord,-s.nd be
strong for labour-in dilfnsing bless-
ings among men.
Having been duly prepared in the
wilderness, they are at length brought
forward into the land of Canaan.
.And it ia granted them, according as
ia required, and as they have a heart
to take possession. Moses and Joshua
are dead; but their King liveth, and
ia Almighty. They lie exposed to
their enemies, who surround them on
every side; and who give them con-
tinual occasion for the vigorous ex-
ercise of their minds in defence, and
in the wise management of their
national relations. Their enemies
have no power, but when Israel them-
selves give itto them bytheir rebellion
against their beaveuly King. They
are taught to depend upon the Al-
mighty, who will infallibly protect
them in the right, and punish them in
the wrong. Their Judges are bia
officers, raised up for the occasion.
To them the nation must not look;
but to that Gcd, who hath appointed
them. Ifthey look to man, they are
disappointed, and broken. It ia now,
more especially, that the Lord ia
training them to go alone. Each in-
dividual ia, in a great measure, made
to think and act for himself. A more
powerful or better consolidatedgovern-
ment, among them, than that of the
Judges, might have given to the body
of the people more strength; but it
would not, so much, have strengthened
the individual character: and it was
with a regard to this, that the Lord
was training them, much more than
for the purpose of giving them present
ease as a nation. It was not to make
them the UBeful instruments of one
~ as under ali absolute monarchy;
but to make them a nation of kings
and priests unto God, that he had
delivered them from their Egyptian
task-masters. But they did not con-
sider their latter end, for which their
Lord was preparing them. Theygrew
impatient of this state of things, and
required a king, like the nations around
them. He warned them ofthe evilsinto
which they were plunging: but they
were importunate,-s.nd he gave them
a king in bia anger, and took him away
in biawrath. Theyare againtaught the
folly oftrusting in man:-the king wh9
was to combinetheirscatteredenergiee,
and lead them forth successfullyto bat-
tle, left them in the hands ofthe enemy•
But the Lord has again a bright
course of training for them; and to
this, the concentrated form of a kingly
commonwealth ia better adapted. .And
David ia raised up to execute thlf pur-
pose of God. It would be difficult to
name a single faculty of the human
mind, affective or intellectual, which
was not remarkably manifested in
David; who, from feeding bia father's
flock. was taken to feed the flock
of Gcd-the people of Israel. Hia
genius, with regard to music and
poetry, was especially remarkable. To
the beautiful appointments in the ser-
vice of God, addressed to the ege, and
chiefly administered by Moses; be
added those, which were no less ne-
cessary and instructive, addressed to
the ear: and the songs of rejoicing are
sung, which anticipate the glory of

Messiah's kingdom,-when the songat
eal.vation shall reeound throughout the
world. ThecharacterofDavid'a power-
ful mind appears to have been indelibly
impresaed upon the nation. He waa
indeed an eminent type of the King of
Zion, both in his aulferinga and in his
triumph&. David, whose name means
belowd, aeems to have been eminently
distinguished for reigning in the affec-
tions of his people. When this throne
waa taken from him, as by Abeal.om's
atea1ing away the hearts of the people,
he refuaec1 to remain in his throne
at Jerueal.em; and withheld himaelf
therefrom, until the people voluntarily
called the king beck. And the Re-
deemer shall be given the throne of
his father, David, in both 1'1!8Jl8Ct&
His people " shall be willing in the
day of his power," when he shall
" send the rod of his atrength on~ of
Zion."
But the Kingdom of Messiah is to
be eminently a kingdom of peace; and
wisdom and knowledge shall be the
stability of His times. The sapphire,
the heaven-aasimilated throne,inwhich
the King shall reign over the earth, is
-ted upon a body of brightness, like
to the ternDle crystal. As if to repre-
sent this peaceful light, the true sup-
port of powerful love, Solomon, the
peaceful prince, and wisest of mortals,
is raised up,-to give the widest range
to the observing, and the deepest tone
to the reflective faculties. He gives
a grand example of the temple of
knowledge, to be filled with the glory
of the Lord: and he is permitted to
rear that wondrous type, the temple
at Jerueal.em; holding forth the great
mystery of godlineBB, and embracing
so many leBBODB of love and ofholine1111.
But, as if to teach the folly-the utter
folly of leaning upon an arm of flesh,
and putting implicit confidence in any
man, in the things of God,-this, their
greatest king, and the wisest among
men, W118 allowed to fall into the very
dregs of folly; and he leads the way
in the spiritual adultery of the nation.
He seems, also, by elevating the mon-
archy, to have lowered the people, as
to their standing in the oommonwealth;
D
and to have oppreaeed the nation
he waa given to protect; and whoae
capital he W118 gilding with foolish
magnificence,-making it ouly the
more tempting a prize for the enemy.
Thus, also, waa his father, the man
after God's heart, left to fall into
the most base and revolting at erimes.
Thus was Moses, the meekest of men,
guilty of the greatest impatience.
Thus, also, do we find righteous and
benevolent Joseph, the preserver of
nations, guilty of one of the greatest
public wrongs, and sweeping calami-
ties,-in leading one of the most highly
improved nations into a state of even
personal slavary; putting them into
such a position, as that any political
change would be esteemed by them a
gain. Thna waa Jacob, so generally
without guile, guilty of the groasest
deception. And thus waa pious and
affectionate Isaac guilty of an attempt
to frustrate the purpose of God, in a
most material point, oocasioningthere-
by, the greatest domestic confusion
and bereavement. And thusdid faith-
ful Abraham so little trust his God, as
even deliberately to deny his bosom
companion. And thus was righteous
Lot found halting, after being so sig-
nally delivered from Sodom. And
thus waa Noah also an oqject of shame
to his own children, after resisting
a world of ungodlin888; and being so
wonderfully preserved from that de-
struction which overwhelmed it. How
instructive is the history of Israel;-
and, indeed, of the world I How in-
ceaaant in commanding to" cease from
man, whose breath is in his nostrils."
" Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for
in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
strength." And "Let him that think-
etb he standeth, take heed lest he
fall."
The kingdom of Israel had been
rapidlyattaining to an elevatedposition
among the nations; and it might have
been supposed, had matters so pro-
gressed, that now waa come the ex-
pected glory. Men might have been
in danger of mistaking the type, for
the thing typified. But in no such
danger were they left. It is too plain,
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
50 IT W.d AJ'TE1l IlllUEL lUD LBH TBB ~, (!.Be. IV.
that the purposes of God with regard I
to Israel, were not at all accomplished
or consummated, whilst they were
under the kings; and the religious state
of the people had greatly degenerated
before the death of Solomon: and '
when this was the ease, their political
happiness could not long abide. Im-
mediately the kingdom divided:-that
house, of whomthe Onepromised Seed,
Christ, was to come, nmaining attach-
ed to the family of David; whilst the
house of Joseph-that of which the
multitudinous seed was to come, erect-
ed a new kingdom for themselves,
under Jeroboam. An ignoble termi-
nation was thus made to so glorious a
beginning; plainlyintimating, that this
people had not yet arrived at that for
which they were so long under such a
careful course of training. Ephraim
was separated from Judah-not only
in a political, but also in a religious
respect. Both houses were, during
the reign of their respective kings,
tanght many severe lessons, as to the
unprofitableness of departing from
God. Still God was dealing with them
in kindness, and preparing them for
their different destinies. The Jews,
who were not designed to be a maritime
people, but a kind of universal medium
of communication among mankind by
land, were given an entirely inland
position; whilst Israel, who were still
more extensively to be a band of union
to the human raoe,-who were to be
spread unto the most distant isles,
were, before being taken out of their
land,-e.nd even from the time they
entered it,-in the most careful man-
ner, taught maritime aft'airs,-not only
as possessing the small sea of Galilee,
bnt by their being placed all along the
upper border of the great, or Mediter-
ranean sea; and in connection with
such perfect masters of those matters
as were the inhabitants of Tyre and
Sidon,-by whom, also, their archi-
tectural taste had already been con-
siderably improved. The keeping of
cotemporary chronicles of their own
and other nations,-the art of war,-
and the power of making expeditions
by sea,-e.nd of planting colonies,-
and of keeping up an extensive corre-
spondence with distant parts of the
world,-were especially neceseary for
them to possess. And all this was, in
the kind providence of God, prepared
· for them before the final breaking up
of their nation:-when, for the misim-
provement of their many great privi-
leges, they were cast out, and )eft; to
become wanderers among the nations.
They had been instructed in all that
they could receive at home, and had
now to go forth on their travels, to
learn that, in foreign countries, with
toil and trouble, which they would
not be taught bymore peaceable means
at home.-Nor should we forget tluu
they were thus to suffer for the good
of others. The casting away of them
was to be the riches of the Gentiles,
and the restoring of them shall be like
life from the dead:-
"He wUI h3Te compaulon upon u,
He will subdue our lnlqulliea,
And thou wilt caat all their ainl Into the
depths of the aea.
Thou wilt perform the truth to 1aoob,
Whi~Th:~'f:!t~!=-:'~to our fathen
from the da71 ofold."
The most cursory view of the
known history of Israel may convince,
that they cannot be found among an
inferior, or even stationary people.
Theywere ever in a state of transition
--ever passing on from one lesson to
a higher, in the achool of their Great
Teacher. And in them eminently the
saying was to be fulfilled, " Train up
a child in the way he should go, and
when he is old he will not depart from
it." Their symbol is the palm tree,
that bringeth forth fruit in old age.
" They shall be fat, and ftourishing;
to show that the Lord is upright, my
Rock, and no unrightecusnessin him."
"This people have I formed for m:yaelf,
The7 BhaJl show forth m7 pralae.''
They were veseels afore prepared
unto glory, and were subsequently to
be called, in order that they might be
fully fashioned and used, according to
the good purpose of God. Thia was to

be IIOOODI.pliahed, not only with regard
to a portion of those that, under the
DAme of Jews, remained in the land,
but more particularly as to the holl88
ofIsrael who were lost, that theymight
become the riches of the Gentiles, and
who were cast away for the reconciling
of the world.
.As yet, when the gifts and calling
of God are manifest in Israel, shall be
realized this glad prediction of Isaiah,
{chap. xxxii. v. 1-5):-
D2
"Behold, a King shall reign In righteousneu,
And princes shall rule in judgment;
And a Man ahall be as an biding-place from tha wind,
And a covert from the tempest;

IN speaking of the chosen people
of God, it is proper that we discrimi-
nate clearly between the two houses,
generally distinguished by the names
Ephraim, or Israel, or the house of
Iaaac, for the ten tribes; and Judah,
or the Jews, for the two tnl>es that
remained with the family of David.
Sometimes, indeed, the latter house is
also called the house of Israel; and
then the ten tribes are called.AllIsrael,
or the Whole House of Israel; aa in
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
L1'lC. v.]
Ezek. xxxvii. 16; and al110 before that,
in verse 11; and in various other parts
of his prophecy. This distinction be-
tween the two houses 8eelllfl to have
been made very early. David reigned
Bix years and a half, in Hebron, over
the house of Judah, before he reigned
the thirty-three years in Jerusalem,
over Israel and Judah; (2 Sam. v. 5.)
Solomon, his 110n, reigned forty years.
Seventy-three years,in all, the house of
Israelremainedentire,-when another
and more Jlllml&llent separation took
place; a breach,whichhath not hither-
to been healed. Upon the death of
Solomon, when the tribes met to-
gether, for the acknowledgment ofhis
BOn Rehoboam, as king, they pre-
sented, as it were, a bill of rights,
requesting that their burdens should
be le888ned. This he ultimately re-
fused, threatening them with still
heavier oppression, and a more severe
rule, than they ha.d been visited with
by his father, (1 Kings xii. 16.) "So,
when AU r-z saw that the king
hearkened not unto them, the people
answered the king, saying,-
Wbat portion have we in David I
Neither have we inheritance In the IOD or
Jetae.
To :ronr tento, 0 Iuaell
Now oee to thine own bonae, David.
So Israel departed unto their tents:
but as for the children of Israel which
dwelt in the cities ofJudah, Rehoboam
reigned over them." He afterwards
attempted to raise tn"bute from All Is-
rael, without their consent; but, AU
r-z stoned .Adonijah, who was over
the tn"bute; and Rehoboam himself
was gla.d to get up into his chariot,
and flee to Jerusalem. " So Israel
rebelled againet the house of David,
unto this day." We find it then re-
corded, (verse 20,) that "AU r-z
called Jeroboam, the 110n of Nebat,
unto the congregation, and made him
king overAU IINJd." Nothing ofim-
portance remained to the house of
David, "but the tribe of Judah only."
It is probable, however, that, ulti-
mately, a portion of each of the tribes
was joined to either house of lsra.el.
53
.About three times as long as they ha.d
been united under the house of David,
did Israel and Judah remain together
in the land;-separated as to govern-
ment, and much, also, as to religion.
-During this space, ofabout two hun-
dred and thirty years, many changes
took place in the house of Ephraim.
They seem to have been continually
in movement; but at this time, the
spirit ofchange wrought ratherdarkly,
like the unseemly heavings of the
chaolic mass, before beauty covered
the face of this fair creation. .Amid
these revolutions, many, it seems, went
over to the house of David, or king-
dom of Judah, which was more sta-
tionary; and which continued more to
cherish the vision of their departed
glory, and the hope of ita return, in
greater brightness, to. abide for ever.
. The two houses seem to have been
intended toful1ll considerably different
purposes, in God's economy of grace
to the world. Of Judah was to come
the One promised Seed,the Heir ofall
things: ofEphraim, the multitudinous
seed, eo much promised to the fathers,
-the many brethren, who are also
called the Lord's first.bom. Judah
has been a standing witness to the
prophetic word; whilst lsrael,-long,
to appearance, lost, is to oome forth
withoverwhelmingwitneeeto the truth
in the latter time. Judah was the
first-fruita, gathered in the apostolic
age; but lsra.el is the harvest, to be
gathered at the Lord's return. Judah
was privileged to carry out the Gmpel
to the north, and north-west, to the
many nations that havecome ofJacob;
and these are being employed in car-
rying it out thence, unto all the ends
of the earth. Judah and hie brethren
were to be preserved alive in the
midst of famine; but this was to be
sooomplished by their unknown bro-
ther, Joseph, who ha.d been sent be-
fore them, and given a headship over
the heathen. Judah seems to be given
no home but that ofhisfathers; whilst
blessings unto the utmost bound ofthe
everlasting hills, are promised to come
" upon the head of Joseph, upon the
crown of the head of him that wu

aeparated from hia brethren." Their
cities, it ~ are to bespread abroad;
they are to be such an innumerable
multitude, that, although the land of
Israel will be their common centre,
they will, at the same time, be po686s-
sors of sea and land, unto the ends of
the earth.. But then, indeed, Iarael
and Judah shall have become one.
They shall be one nation, upon the
mountains of Israel, for ever.
The Time haviug come for the re-
moval of Israel into their place of hid-
ing; or, rather, their destined position,
as the administrators of blessing to the
nations whom the Lord intended to
bring into his inheritance, he prepared
fit instruments for the purpose: who
seem to have spared no labour or cost,
so as that the work should be fully
accomplished. The first grand instru-
ment, was the king of Assyria, the rod
of the Lord's auger for the correction
of Iarael. In 2 Kings, xv. 29, we read
that, " In the days of Pekah, king of
Iara.el, came Tiglath-pileser, king of
Assyria, and took ljon, and Abel-beth-
maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh,
and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee,
all the land of Naphtali, and carried
them captive to Assyria." Assyria
lies northward of the Holy Land, and
approaching the Caspian and Euxine
seas. This captivity ofthe most north-
east portion of Israel, is suppoeed to
have happened before the Christian
era, about seven hundred and forty
years; which is just about the time
that had elapsed since their haviug
been brought out of Egypt. This first
captivity is adverted to, also, in 1
Chron. v. 26. After having remarked
that Israel had transgressed against
the God of their fathers; and gone a
whoring after the gods of the people of
the land, whom God destroyed from
before them, it is said, " And the God
of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul,
king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tig- .
lath-pileser, king of Assyria, and he
carried them away, even the Reuben-
ites, and the Gadites, and the half
tribe of Ma.nasseh, and brought them
unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and
to the river. Gozan, unto this day."
About nineteen years after this partial
captivity, another and a more complete
removal of Israel took place; with re-
gard to which, it is said, (2 Kings,
xvii. 6,) "In the ninth year ofHoshea,
the king of ABSyria took Samaria,"
(the capital of the kiugdom of lerael,)
" and carried Israel away captive into
Assyria, and placedthem in Halah,and
in Habor, by the river of Gozan, and
in the cities of the Medea." This se-
cond captivity is said to have occurred
about the year before Christ seven
hundred and twenty; that is, about
one hundred &Dd twenty years before
the captivity of Judah, under Nebu-
chadnezzar. We are now past the
middle of the third thousand yean
since the political death of that house,
which is so frequently called, in Scrip-
ture, AU I~rael. And, as one day is
with the Lord as a thousand yean,
and a thousand years as one day; and,
as the Lord oondescended to fulfil, in
Himself, many things which are ac-
oomplished in his people, He, on the
third day, arose from the dead, to as-
cend into glory: 80 is Israel given to
say, as in Hosea, vi 2, 3 :-
" After two daya will he rev!Ye 111;
Io tho third day be will raise os up:
A.nd we abwllive In bla sight:
Then aball we know.
... We follow on to know the Lord:
Hio going forth II prepared, aa the mom·
lng;
And be aball come unto ua u the rain,
Aa the latter and former rain unto the
earth."
So much as to the Time ofthe cap-
tivity; and now, as to the CompleteM.
thereof. It has been objected, that the
difficulty of transporting such a mul-
titude of people to any great distance,
was 80 great, as to make it altogether
improbable that anything like the
whole nation was carried away, as de-
scribed. It may perhaps be said that
it was only the more useful and noble
part ofthe inhabitants that were taken :
the oommon people being left to cul-
tivate the land. This hypothesis,
however, is not borne out, either by
the language of Scripture or the facts
of the case. With regard to the cap-
Digitized by Coogle
LBc.v.]
t;ivity ofJudah,indeed, which wu long
alter, it ia expreaaly mentioned, that
the baaer of the people were left;: and
thia may have beeu to obviate the very
evils which had been incurred in the
caae of Israel's captivity,-which W88
ao oomplete, that the wild beaata mul-
tiplied in the land, and greatly an-
noyed the new Gentile inhabitants:
ao much ao, that they felt obliged to
propitiate, as they thought, the God of
the land, by uniting the worship ofthe
God of Israel with that of their other
gods; and for thia p111'Jl016, they were
under the neceasity of sending to the
king ofAssyria for an laraelitiahpriest.
No such supply of new inhabitants,
and no such multiplyingofwild beasts,
do we read of, in the C886 of Judah;
and yet we know, that Judah's cap-
tivity was very great. Let us also
consider, that when the captivity of
Israel ia mentioned, it ia uniformly
spoken of 88 being national, and not
merely in part. Before the captivity
took place, Amos (vii. 17,) declared,
" Israel shall surely go into captivity,
forlll of hia land... And, immediately
before it took place, Iaaiah (chapter
vii,) very graphically describes the de-
solation of the land which would en-
sue. And in 2 Kings, xvii. 23, it ia
thus described: " The Lord removed
Israel out of hia sight, 88 he had said,
by all his servants, the prophets: ao
wu Israel carried away out of their
own land to Assyria, unto this day."
Thus oomplde was the captivity.
Now let us inquire 88 to ita Ccmtiltu-
- . Were the children of ls:rael ever
restored to their own land, as W88 the
house of Judah, after the Babylonian
captivity? In the book of Kings,
which brings down the history of the
Jews to the year before Christ five
hundredandsixty-two,(aboutonehun-
dred and sixty years after the cap-
tivity; and long after the breaking up
of the Assyrian empire,) it is expressly
laid, 88 we have JUSt seen, that the
captivity of Israel had not then been
restored. And upon the releue of
Judah frOm their seventy years' cap-
tivity in Babylon, we have no evidence
whatever that Israel returned with the
55
Jews; exoept, indeed, u to some of
those from the ten tribes, who had
previously united with the Jews, and
who were reckoned 88 belonging to
the kingdom of Judah. The two
ho11868 had otherwise beoome greatly
alienated. After the return of the
Jews, to build Jeruealem, Samaria etill
remained in the poi868Sion of the Gen-
tiles; and, ao far from there being an
interchange of tavonra, as was foretold
would be the cue upon the return of
Israel to their own mountain of &.
maria, (see Jer. :axi.) we find that,
instead, the Jews were cureing the
Samaritans, and would have no deal-
ings with them. Galilee, northward of
Samaria, came afterwards into union
with Judah; but, not 88 being peopled
by returning Israel. It wu only a
Jewish colony, having Gentiles inter-
mingled with them. It ia the convic-
tion of the Jews themselves, that they
have never yet been joined to the ten
tribes; which denial they have little
temptation to make, seeing that their
prospect ofa happy settlement, in their
own land, can never be realized, until
they are fully reunited unto Ephraim,
the first-born. The Jews may, from
their own Scriptures, most clearly
know, that without Ephraim they can-
not be blessed:--even 88 clearly, 88
that, when the two nations are made
one;-when God hath" acoompliahed
to seatter the power of the holy peo-
ple," their troubles shall be ended,
and Mesaiah's glorious kingdom be
es&abliehed in the earth.
And now, 88 to the~ to which
Israel were carried: ~tracing out
which, we may the more certainly dis-
cover the route which they afterwards
took; and be led towards their preeent
abode; to the places in which they
were ao to take root, and ftonriah, and
bring forth the multitude of nations
afterwards to be united into one. .AJ..
syria, and Media, are among the places
we can most easily identiJY. Assyria
lay north-aut of the Holy Land; and
Media still further, in the same dirac- •·
tion. In the maps, Media ia usually
made to include the sonthern border
of the Caspian, 88 far west 88 the
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
56
.Araxes. This north-western portion
of Media seems, however, to have been
80JDewhat independent of Media Pro-
per. It was, perhaps, rather claimed
by the Mede., than actually at all
timee )l088!l88ed. It wae the Ieee likely
to be eo, if this were the quarter to
which Ephraim was carried captive;
or of which he took po88888ion upon
being brought forth into the north
country. Without any apparent regard
to our present view, it is to this neigh-
bourhood that the Saxona have been
traced, by one of the most eminent of
our historians. The river running into
the Caspian, 80Uth-t of the .Araxes,
is now called Kuzal Ozan, and may
possibly be the Gozan, mentioned as
that on the banks of which BOIDe of
Israel were located. The empire of
Assyria is supposed to have reached
down into Asia Minor. It is likely
enough, that BOIDe portions of captive
Israel were sent in this direction, and
materially ae8iated in giving birth to
BOIDeofthoseimportantetatesthathere,
afterwards, arose, and sent forth nu-
merous colonies westward. The foun-
tain which supplied theae, it is not
utravagant to suppose, wae Israel,
whose seed was to be in many waters;
--eee Num. xxiv. 7.
It is remarkable, that almost imme-
diately upon Israel's transmission.into
the northern possessions of A.esyria,
those countries, and especially Media,
revolted from under the .A.ssyrians;
and seem to have lived, for some time,
as Israel had 80 long lived, every man
doing that which was right in his own
eyes : they having only Judges, of
popular election, without any power-
ful executive. For this, of course, the
other people were not even 80 well
prepared as Israel were. Great disor-
der, accordingly, prevailed; and many
of Israel, it is probable, took the op-
portunity of effecting their eecape, to
some mare remote abode of their own
choosing. And room, at this very time,
wae made for them, farther north, by
an immense migration from thence,
which now came ponring into Asia;
and, for a number of years, held great
part of these countriee in subjection:
(LBO. v.
arresting any arm that would have
been stretched out aft:.er Israel, in their
progreu more northward. Those that
remained, would, doubtless, greatly
invigorate the Median commonwealth;
which, having, like the leraelites in
the time of the Judges, found that
kind of government inauffieient for
personal security, made choice of a
king, one Deioces, to whom they al-
lowed a powerful executive. The
Medel forthwith arose into great
power; and extended their dominioo,
by the conquest of some neighbouring
states, such as Persia,~n which Bide,
afterwards, the empire chiefly raised
up itself, and ultimately grasped, in a
manner, the world. It was the instru-
ment, under Cyrus, of letting captive
Judah return from Babylon. And in-
timately must Judab have become
connected with the eonth-eastern por-
tion of this empire, as well as Israel,
with its north-western, when we find
a Jewees, Esther, as their queen; and
Jews, such as Daniel and Mordecai, in
the first offices of state.
Althoughthe Assyrian had laboured
80 diligently in the removal of Israel
from his own land into the north
country, his purpose was very much
opposed to that of the God of Israel:
He thought to interweave the eeveral
parts of his empire 80 to@ether, as to
make them more entirely one. Thus
proudly did be boast ; (Is. x. 13,
14):-
" By the atreDgth of my hand I haft

We should never forget that the
house of Ierael, which was taken away
oaptive, or othenriae diaperlled,by the
.Aasyrian, wall that which is called the
VIMk 1aouu of~-~ or AU Iwad; and
this, both in the historical and pro-
phetical pal'ta of Scripture,-both at
the time they separated from Judah,
and also after they had been taken
captive bythe Aasyrian into the north
country. They are, of the Lord's pe-
culiar treaaure, not merely 118 one
piece of money, bnt the whole ten.
They are, ofthe sheep of God's p&-
ture, not merely 118 one of the hun-
dred, but the ninety-and-nine, who
had wandered into the wilderneaa.
They are, of the family of our Father
in Heaven, the God of Abrabam,-
not merely the younger eon, but even
the first-born; for thus He hath said,
" I am a Father to Israel, and Eph-
raim is my first-born."
Many,overlooking the 01111e oflsmel,
have fixed their eye exclusively upon
the people called Jews; 118 if all that
is said in Scripture about Israel were
fulfilled in them; and, 118 if their re-
turn from Babylon wa11 the grand ful-
filment of thoee glorioua descriptiona
given in the propheta respecting the
perfectly peaceable and permanent re-
~ettlement in the land of.All tile 1aouu
of Iwael, after their old estate; the
57
Lord doing even better for them than
a& their beginnings. The restoration
of even the Jews, from Babylon, wall
only partial ; and, 118 it were, but &
pledge of what is hereafter to take
place, with regvd to both Judah and
Israel. The great body ofthe people
- to have remained in the land of
the enemy. It certainly could notbe
ofthat time that the Lord hath eaid,-
u in Ezekiel, (xxxix. 28, 29):-
.. I bangatheredthem untotheirown land,
And have len none ofthem anrmore there,
Neither will I hide m7 f""" an7 more from
them :
Por I have poured out m7 Spirit 11pon the
houae of hreel,
Salth the Lord God."
It wu not from thenceforth that Je-
l"llll&lem wa11 aafely inhabited, and that
no stranger puaed through her any
more. The very oontrvy of all theae
things, in a remarkable degree, took
place; a11 ifto force our view forward
to the grand truth of prophecy-the
full redemption of Israel.
But now let ue apeak, for a little,
with thoee who seem to take a more
rational viewofthe aubject,-who look
upon the promises 118 still future, and
to be accomplishedin the peoplecalled
JeWJ-the recognized children of the
fathers, untowhom,and to whose eeed,
the promi&ell were made. Let them
remember that many-very many of
the Jews, who were dispersed in the
east at the time of the Babylonish
captivity, .became mingled among the
Dationa, and their de8Cendantll arenot
now known a11 beingJeWB. Theymay
have much tended to originate, or, at
leut, to improve aome of thoee iribea
that border upon India and Persia;
and that are Baid OOD8iderably to re...
semble the Jews. Theae are gene-
rally Mahometans: and many of the
Jews in other pa;rta alao embracedthe
religion of Mahomet; neither aretheir
deeoendantll now known to be Jews.
A much more pleasing disperllion of
them, in the apostolic age,·took place,
when multitudes of even the priests
were obedient to the faith. Thewhole
original stockofthe ChristianChurch,
in all parts of the world, waa Jewieh.

That which embraced the Gospel was,
doubtless, the more favoured portion
of the Jewish nation,-the true heirs
of the promises. Yet, neither are their
descendants now known 88 being of
Judah, Benjamin, or Levi. And we
may be certain, that iC there are peen-
liar blessings in store for the natural
seed of Abraham, in the line of Isaac
and of Jacob, those promised bless-
ings would most surely not be for-
feited for their children, by their
acceptance of Christianity. But the
children of these early Jewish con-
verts initiated their children into the
faith of their fathers, and gathered np
others together with them into the
same family of God. And because
they did so, are their children to be
disinherited? But what, in the mean-
time, were the people called the Jews
doing? Why the very same thing, in
their own way. They, also, were ever
receiving disciples. Even in our Sa-
viour's time, they were compaasing
sea and land to make one proselyte:
and just before that, they had been
making them wholesale. Thus we
read that about the year one hundred
and twenty-nine before Christ, a whole
nation waa introduced into the Jewish
church. And what nation should
this be? The very people against
whom, 88 the last prophet, Malachi,
(i. 4,) declares, " The Lord hath indig-
nation for ever." John Hyrcanus hav-
ing conquered the Edomites, or Idu-
means, reduced them to this necessity,
either to embrace the Jewish religion,
or else to leave the country, and seek
new dwellings elsewhere. They chose
to leave their idolatry rather than
their country; and all became prose-
lytes to the Jewish religion. And
when they had thus taken on them
the religion of the Jews, they con-
tinued united to them ever after: till
at length the name of Edomites w88
lost in that of Jews; and both people
became consolidated into one and the
same nation together :-so much so,
that at the time the true ·King of the
Jews waa born, an Idumean swayed
the sceptre of Judea, and was the
great restorer of the temple to that
[LEe. v.
glory, in which it waa so admired
by the disciples of our Lord, before
its destruction by the Romans. Now,
the children of Edom were cUPSed,-
and that curse they have not escaped,
although they have nominally bei..'Ome
Jews. Nay, they must have in-
creaaed their curse by thirsting after
the blood of Christ, as soon 88 he W88
born into the world ; and by af\er-
wards joining in the cry, " His blood
be upon us and our children." And
who can now tell whether this or that
Jew is of Esan, whom the Lord hated?
or of Jacob, whom he loved? Nay;
have they not all inherited the curse
·of Edom,-by continuing in his spirit
and behaviour, 88 despising the birth-
right, and persecuting the Son of Pro-
mise,-as well as by the most inti-
mateinterminglingofraces? Is it ouly
here that we are to look for the first-
born Israel?
But more than this. It would seem
that even the Canaanites themselves,
who were, emphatically, the children
of the curse, were gradually, and at
length fully, amalgamated with the
Jews, so as to become one people with
them. This seems to have been the
case in even the capital of the king-
dom,-Jerusalem, where waa both the
throne and the temple ; and which,
(immediately before these were placed
there,) was inhabited by Jebusites,
whose king had been the leading king
among the Amorites, one of the most
accursed nations of Canaan. And we
are expressly told that the tribe of
Judah could not put out these Jehu-
sites; nor did the tribe of Benjamin
put them out: but they remained
there, among the children of Judah,
and the children of Benjamin, until
the time of David, when they were
built up in the very midst of the
Jews, retaining even their possession
of the land there; as is evident in the
case of Araunah the J ebusite, over
whose threshing-floor the angel stayed
his hand, when cutting down the
people, because of the sin of David
their king. That was literally true,
which the Lord said by Ezekiel,
(xvi. 3); and which, those that plead
o;g,tiwd by Coogle
LEC. v.]
for the literal interpretation of Scrip-
ture, llhould not gainl!&y:-
"Thu1 oaith the Lord God to Jeru.oalem,
Thy birth and thy nativity II of the land
ot Canaan;
Thy father wu an o\morite,
And thy mother AD Hittite.•
The very first mothers of the Jews;
Shuah, the mother of Judah's first
three children ; and also Tamar, mo-
ther of Phares and Zara. ; were, it
would seem, Canaanites of the children
of Heth. And the men of Jerusalem,
the first stock of its inhabitants, were
Jebllllites, belonging to the nation of
the Amoritea. But, was that tribe, or
that city, therefore, excluded from the
inheritance of IBrael? No. Of that
very tribe,-although into the line of
his ancestry wa.s brought another C&-
naanitess, Rahab, ofJericho; and, also,
the Moabitess, Ruth,~f that very
tribe, by this very line, came Christ,
the Saviour, the promised Son of D&-
vid, the rightful King of Israel. And
this very city did he make one of the
principal scenes of his ministry ; and
here it wa.s that he commanded his
apostles to commence their ministry,
after his resurrection : here it wa.s that
the Holy Ghost descended in such
power, upon the day of Pentecost; and
hence was the glad sound of salvation,
in the name of Jesus, sent forth unto
the ends of the earth. Say we these
thing&---do wethen bring furwardthese
historical truths-for the purpose of
disparaging the Jew? No: far be it:
-but to illustrate the truth respect-
ing IBrael ; and to llhow, that those
;. who were taken out of the land can-
notbemorelostamong theGentiles,than
were the people that remained in the
land. H there wa.s one people cursed
above another, it wu Edom, of the
children of Abraltam : it wa.s Canaan,
among the more immediate descend-
ants of Noah: and with both of these
the Jews have beoome moat signally
mingled, so a.s to become one people
with them, and so as to inherit the
curse of both. M Ham, the father of
Canaan, exposed Noah, the l!&viour of
his family, to llhame, so have his chi!-
59
dren, as being the inhabitants of J ern-
salem, expoeed to llhame the Saviour
of the world, and that, upon the ac-
cursed tree; and a.s Edom pursued his
brother Jacob with constant hatred,
so did his descendants among the Jews
pursue,with unceasing hatred, not only
Christ, the Head, but also his follow-
ers, so long a.s they had the power.,
But, shall they be excluded P No:
Even although the Canaanites, dwell-
ing along the sea coast, were also ulti-
mately taken up into Judah ; yet
still,-i!ven granting that with them
is Aahkelon, and Aahdod, and Ekron,
-still we have the word of prophecy,
(Zech. ix. 7):-
" He that remalneth, even he,-for our
God ; and he shall be •• a go•emor in
JudAh; and Ekron u a JebUIIte.•
-Even Ekron shall be as that portion
of the Canaanites, who were built up
in the very midst of His people. But,
if God will deal thus kindly with the
Jews, who are thus ao unequivocally
one with the children of the curse;
it may be expected, that He will deal
at least equally, according to promise,
with that other house, which compre-
hends the body of the people, so a.s to
be called all I&rtW ; and which, how-
ever mingled among the Gentiles, can-
not be worse mingled than the Jews
are--about whose case, as the subject
of prophecy, so little doubt has been
generally entertained.
When the great restoration of Is-
rael ia referred to in prophecy, let it
be again remembered, it ia Israel, or
Ephraim, that is chielly spoken o£ It
ia that house of Israel which has been
accounted lost, that is ever brought to
remembrance. Jerusalem and her
daughters shall not return, until they
return in the midst of Samaria and her
daughters ; and also, it would seem,
amid the children of Lot : and not by
her own covenant, which she has bro-
ken, shall Judah be given possession
of the land; but in the right of the
One Seed, Christ, the true First-born,
their crucified Messiah, upon whom
they shall look, and mourn their unbe-
lief and ingratitude. Then llhall they

a1eo aclmowledge that God baa, in-

Ephraim is his first-born, in whoee re-o
ligioua privileges, as well as temporal
bleeeings, they shall be glad to parti-

Judah walk with the house of Israel,
and they shall .come together out of
the land of the north, to the land that
the Lord bad given unto the fathers, in
the name of the promised Me88iab.
This grand gathering together will, it
would seem, take place in the north;
and chiefiy in the north-west. But it
is not alone here, where Antichrist
bath his eeat, and where Christ bath

and rock of offence, to both houses of
lsrael,-it ie not ouly here that the
lost aheep of the'houee of Israel shall

the countries around, shall aleo be

The prophet Isaiah, besides having
mentioned, in the preceding part of
chapter xi, the great release from tM
tDic1led, here in the north-west, takes,
in verse 11, quite a cirouit all round
the land,-mentiouing Egypt and Pa-
thros, in the eouth, Cush and Elam, in
the east, Shinar and Hamath, north-
ward, and the Islands of the Sea,in the
west.
It ie not ofJudah, alone, whoee cap-

prophesied-it was of All Israel, that

NOTWITBS1'J.liDDIG the cleameae of
the prophetic word, respecting the
recovery of Israel, in the latter time,
their very existence has, like the birth
of a eon to Sarah, appeared to many,
all but impoaaible. Juat as sure, bow-
ever,as r-oWas born, aballthenations
that were to come of Jacob, be forth-
coming. We_have the word of God for
the one, as well as for the other; and, if
this may avail any Uling, we have it far
more frequently. The prophets ex-
patiate greatly upon this; and the New
Testament has very explicit infol'llla.-
tion upon the point. But, let ua, for
a moment, turn aside, to bear what
man has to say upon the matter, that
eo we may the better be prepared to
see the value of that maaa of evidence,
which has been provided in the kind
providence of God, to remove bia
objections, and confirm him in the
truth of God's most holy Word.
Some have supposed, that Israel, if

not lost, are yet, at least, so mixed
among other people,-eo blended with
the Gentiles, as that they cannot be
restored. And, it is, indeed, true, that
"Ephraim bath mingled himselfamong
the people;" and that the Lord bath
sown Israel to hlmself in the earth;
and that, like seed sown in the earth,
he was, for a while, to all appearance,
lost; but it is also true that,-
(Is. xxvii. 6,)
"He ahall cause them that come of Jacob,
to take root ;
Iorael sball bloaaom and bud,
And fill the face ofthe world with fruit."
The seed of GOO was, therefore, not in
reality to be lost. His design, with
regard to the people, sball, most
assuredly, be at length accomplished.
To the same purpose do we read, in
the same prophet, (Ixi. 9-11),
"And their aeed saALL BB &liOWII among
the Gentilea,
And their offapring among the people ;
All thataee them shall acknowledge them,
That they, the seed the Lord bath bleued.
I will greatly rejoice In the Lord,
My soul shall be joyful in my God;
For he hath clothed me with the garments
ofoalntion,
He bath covered me with the robe of
righteousness;
Aa a bridegroom deeketb with ornaments,
And as a bride adorneth with her jewela.
Por eo the earth bringeth forth her bud,
And as the garden cauaeth the thinga tbat
are aown in it to spring forth;
So the Lord God will cause righteousness
and praise,
To spring forth before all the nations."
The people that have come of
Israel, are thus to be distinguished
among the Gentiles, and are to be
found, a people, whose superiority is
acknowledged by all impartial witnes-
aes. They are also to be found, as a
people eminently blessed by divine
grace, as well as by nature and
providence. Theirs are the garments
ofsalvation,-tbe robe ofrighteousness.
And, here again, the beautiful emblem,
of seed sown in the earth, is brought
forth, to illustrate the case of a people,
whose growth is naturally progressive,
yet such as ~nay well astonish the
world; and it is, that through their in-
strumeutality righteousness and praise
~nay spring forth and spread abroad in
the sight of all people. Such was the
designofGOO with regard to them, from
the beginning; and He will do all his
pleasure.
Perhaps some have run into the
contrary extreme, and have supposed
that something very remarkable is to
distinguish the children of Israel, so as
to make them shine out individually,
as the favourites of Heaven, to the
exclullion, as it were, ofother people;--
that they are, and will reinain, alto-
gether distinct. Such seem to forget
all that is said in Scripture, about the
intermarriage of this people with other
nations; and they overlook what is
constantly occurring in the world, all
down from the days of the Apostles,
who left their children among the
Gentiles. But, is it true, that the
Gentiles are so to be excluded? Or, is
it not rather true, that Israel has been
and sball be, exalted, for the purpose
of communicating blessing to the
Gentiles? What saith Isaiah, to the
stranger, who upon finding God's
wonderful InaDifestation of love to the
children of Israel, throughout all
generations, may be apt to murmur,
" The Lord bath utterly separated me
from his people;" {lvi 6--{8:-
"Also the 10DJ1 or the stranger,
That join themselvea to the Lord,
To 1erve him,
And to lon the name of the Lord,
To be his servants,
Enry one tbat keepeth the Sabbath from

Yes, thus it is written, even with
regard to their great and final aettle-
ment in the land,(Ezekiel, xlvii. 21-

An opinion was once prevalent, that
the propheciesrespecting Israel,applied
to these Christian nations, as being the
spiritual, or surrogate Israel, and that
we are not to look to the literal Israel
as to the people in whom the Scriptures
are to be fulfilled. Now, it is indeed
true that the prophecies do apply to
these Christian nations,-but not to
the exclusion of the literal Israel: for
these nations do not only contain the
main body of the spiritual,-they are
also, as we shall see, the literal Israel.
On the other hand, the idea has
latelybeen scouted bysome,ofapplying
these prophecies to nations called
Gentile,-for it is said, the prophecies
refer exclusively to the literal Israel :
and it is true that the prophecies do
indeed apply to the literal Israel,-but,
for tha~ very reason, they apply to the
modern nations of Europe-and espe-
cially to the English nation, lineally
descended from the lost son, Ephraim.
The oppoeing parties, as to prophecy,
have thus had each a portion of the
truth, which they have been attempting
to magnify into the whole truth; and
thus have they come into such direct
contradiction; and thus are they so
widely separating from each other.
Here is common ground, upon which
thev may meet and embrace as
brethren, both in the ftesh and the
spirit · forgetting their disputes, as lost
in ~tion at the wonderful kind-
ness towards them of the God of their
fathers; and asfeeling the responsibility
under which they are placed, aa the
depositories of the divine bounty, to
minister, to the Jew, on the one hand,
and the Gentile, on the other, the
manifold wisdom of God. Such being
the importance of the subject, let us
earnestly apply our minds to a patient
investigation ofthe truth respecting it.
And, first, let us look at the indica-
tions afforded us of the place ofIsrael's
sojourn,- these may be discovered
in the course of God's providence, and
the leadings of his word.
. There is symmetry in God's work-
ing:-and here it may not be foreign
to our subject to revert again to the
case ofAbraha.tn, to whom the promisee
were first, and so emphatically, made.
He may be said to have had three
families, which seem to have been
designed to leaven, as it were, the
threefamilies ofNoah, alreadyadverted
to. Abraham's first son, Ishmael, Wll8
by Hagar, the Egyptian. He received
his portion in Arabia; and he hal
multiplied and spread as was promised.
He has mainly spread southward; so
that great part of Africa may now be
said to be leavened by his posterity.
Along the south bank of the Mediter-
ranean, even as far as the Atlantic
Ocean, the Arabs have extended their
conquest& Had not the Gothio raoe
come into Europe,Ishmael wouldalso,
mostlikely, have been given to poeseaa
it. But there Wll8 a barrier placed
here, which they could never entirely
remove. The prophecy delivered to
Hagar has been amply fulfilled in her
eon Ishmael; (Gen. xvi. 1~12):-
"J will multiply thy seed exceedingly,
Thatltahali not bennmberedformultltuds.
Behold, thou art with child,
And shalt bear a son,
And abalt call hia name Tahmael;
Becauae the Lord bath beard thy aftllcdoa.
And he will be a wild milD ;
Hla hand will be against nery man,
And every m1111'a band against him ;
And be aball dwell in the praaence of all
bla brethren."
Isaac, Sarah's child, was Abraham's
second son, and in him was the pro-
mised seed to be called.
Abraham's third family was by
Keturah; of whom it is said, Gen.

:av. 2, 5, 6.-" She bare him Zim-
ran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and
Midian, and Ishba.k, and Shnah."-
" And Abraham gave all that he had
unto Isaac. But unto the sons
of the concnbines, which Abraham
had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent
them away from Isaac his son,
(while he yet lived), eastward, unto
the east country." Proceeding east-
ward, it is suppoeed some of the chil-
dren of Abraham by Keturah, reached
India,-where, aay they, their de-
acendanta are still called Brahmins,
from the name of their father Abra-
ham. Certain it is, that these are a
people having a moral and intellectual
constitution much superior to that of
Hindooe generally; and they manifeet
that extreme 6rmnesa of purpoee,-
and, at the aame time, uncommon
mildnesa, which we may suppose to
have characterized Abraham in his
declining years, after all his triala and
exercises of faith; just as, in Ishmael,
we see more reflected the roving and
vigorous character of his earlier years.
As Ishmael seems to have mainly been
given the south, or Africa, the dwell-
ing of the children of Ham; so in the
east the children of Keturah have
spread among the deacendanta of
Shem. In ancient times, the Brah-
mins are said to have occupied a posi-
tion worthy of their high origin. In
the east, learning and science have
been by them chiefly possessed; and
throughout the various changes of
rule in India, they have generally,
there, kept a powerful hold on the
public mind. True, their religion has
become greatly corrupted: but such,
also, has been the case with regard to
Christianity; the types and parables
ofwhich have, in most cases, been 118
little understood as are those of the
Brahmins-derived originally,we may
suppoee, from a good source, but now
mixed up with human fables and idle
fancies, or worse. The time, how-
ever, let us hope, is near, when the
rubbish will be removed, and the pure
gold of sacred truth appear in all ita
native brightness.
With regard to these children of
Abraham in the east;-Ishmael has
been dwelling in the sight of his
brethren: Arabia, the eutern dwell-
ing of Ishmael, being over against
India, where the Brahmins have
spread. It may thus be observed,
that two of the families of Noah have
come into the most intimate connec-
tion with two ofthe families of Abra-
ham: Ishmael with Ham, and the
children of Ketnrah with Shem. It
remains that the other son of Abra-
ham (Isaac, the child of promise), be
given his portion : for him there re-
mains the north-&nd especially the
north-west, in the sight of which Ish-
mael has been dwelling-as being
spread along the south border of the
Mediterranean Ses, over against Eu-
rope. Here, among the isles anciently
possessed by the children of Japhet,
do we find a Semetic people,-ilmi-
nently favoured by natnre and Pro-
vidence, and pre-eminently by Divine
grace; correspondent to the many
great and precious promises which
were so surely made to the seed of
Abraham, in the line of Isaac, Jacob,
Joseph, and Ephraim.
But, that we may be still more
sure 118 to the place in which the lost
sheep of Israel are to be found, let us
again look into the prophetic word,
and see if we can discern ita leading
in this respect. The prophetic word
plainly points northward, no less than
the mysterious needle, whereby the
people of the north have been, in
safety and with certainty, guided in
all directions over the wide Wll8te of
waters. Thus, when a message is
sent after captive Israel, it goes forth
to the north country. See Jeremiah
iii. 12-19. Thence shall both Trea-
cMrou6 Judah and Backlliding Iwael
retnrn, v. 18. See also, for the return
of Israel from the north, ch. xvi.
xxiii. xui., as is more fully illustrated
in the Book of Inheritance.
The Lord, as if relenting over back-
sliding Israel, gives command to the
prophet, saying,
" Go and proclaim these worda toward the
NORTH,
And say, Return thou baek..Jiding Jarael,

"At that time they aball call Jerualem

AAcl they ahaU eome together on o:r lr&&

To the land that I have glveD for an IDhe-
rit&Jice to your fathere."
From this it is clear, that not ocly
was Israel (as distinguished from Ju-
dah) in the north, at the time when
the prophet spoke, but even after Ju-
dah also would have wandered into
the north, Israel would be still found
there; and out of it they are to be
brought toge&her, at the time that
the Lord will make Jerusalem his
throne, and will gather unto it all
nationa,-when the heade of the peo-
ple, from all the cities and fi!milies of
Israel, would be gathered together.
The same return from the IKlfth
country i.e ~gain'and again intimated
throughout Jeremiah'• propheciea, &8
.iB ch. :aili. 6-8.
"Behold the da71 come, aalth the Lord,

B
Thus it i.e plainly stated, that when
Israel ehall be given to enjoy the
blesaedneas of Measiah'• reign, it iB
as having been brought up from the
north country, where they had been
wonderfully BU.Stained and delivered.
The same thing i.e stated in Jer.
uxi 8, where ~gain it i.e decla.red,
"Behold I will brl... them

And gather them
Prom the eoaeta of the earth:~
-And, that we may be at no 101111 to
ascertain the troth, as to what people
are here spoken of, it i.e added, ver. 91
" For I am a father to Iareel,
ADd Ephraim Ia my ftnt·born."
Israel, it i.e thus plainly decla.red, wu
taken into the north ooantry; and
thence are they to be brought at the
time of their great Return.

dream of Nebuchadnezzar, repre..
eented u the II898I'Sl parts of one
great image,-ve eo di.etinguiahed in
prophecy, becanee ca their oonnectiou
with the cause and people of God.
The whole image i.e frequently called
after the head,-Babylon: at the de:.
atruction of which, G!)d will grant
deliverance to Israel. Be will then
have aooompliahed " to -tter the
power of the holy people." By look..
iDg along this line ca empires, and
eeeing to what countries, and to what
people, they lead, we may upect to
have I!Oille light reflected, even from
thia darkn888, upon our path, as being
in eearch of the lost eheep of the
house of Israel. Bow, then, does thia
line lead us? Babylou, the head of
gold, lay north-eastward of the land
of Israel. The breast and arms of
llilver,-the Modo-Persian empire,-
- still more northward, ani ex-
tended itaelf westward, u far as the
utmost extremity of Asia Minor.-
It also indeed spread far eastward.
The Greek empire, repreaented by the
braas, arose still farther north and
westward, in Europe. The lege of
iron,-the Roman empire,-voeestill
farther north-west; and, lastly, there
are the feet, partly iroJl and partly

clay,-the Rom&ll empire in ita Ger-
manic form, in which the children of
.God would be mingling themselves
with the seed of men; but would not
cleave one to &llother, even as iron is
not mixed with miry clay. This ia
the part of the image th&t the atone
is to strike, when the "manifestation
of the sons of God" takes place; when
atra.ngera aha.ll. no more serve them-
selves of Israel, but they sh&ll serve
the Lord their God, &lld David their
,king, "whom I (&&ith Jehovah), will
raise up unto them." He is that
Stone: both the Foundation Stone
upon which the Jews fell &lld were
broken; &nd also the Chief Comer
Stone, th&t cometh down in glory &nd
in power: with regard to which com-
ing, the warning hath gone forth,
" Upon whomsoever it aha.ll. f&ll, it
will grind him to powder."
The same empires e.re, in D&n. vii.,
represented as great beasts. They
&re the wild beuta that have been
ravening upon the mountains ofIsrael
Babylon is here represented as a lion;
the Medo-Perai&n u a bear, . with
three ribs of the tom c&rCIIIe of Israel
between its teeth. Then there is the
Greek empire, represented by a leo-
pard with four heads, in &lluaion to
the four kingdoms into which th&t of
Alexander was parted. And then we
have the fonrth beast, with great iron
teeth, the devourer-the breaker in
piecee-the Rom&n empire. And
lastly, the Anti-Chriati&ll dominion is
described; &nd which synchronizes
with the feet of iron &nd clay-the
Germanic empire. This fifth power
ia represented in Rev. xili. as a beast,
having on his heads names of blas-
phemy. And he hu the ch&r&cter-
istics of &11 the great empires that
have preceded him; &nd these are
mentioned in the order in which they
lie fi:om the north-west. Thna, this
beset is "like a leopard," by which
Greece had been represented; "&nd
his feet were as those of a bear," the
Medo-Perai&n empire; "&nd his mouth
as the mouth of a lion," as boutful,
Babylon. With regard to the fonrth
empire, it is expreuly &&id, " the
•
Dnlgon,"-the dreadful beut--the
devourer-the breaker in piecea,-he
"gave him his seat, &nd power, &nd
great authority." Me88i&h's destruc-
tion of this wicked one, with the rod
of his mouth, at hie glorious appear-
ing, is much the subject of prophecy,
in both the Old Testament Scriptures
&nd the New; &a, for eX&IIlple, in
I&&i&h xi. 1-5:-
" Aud there ohall come forth a Rod
out of the otem of Jeue, and a Branch
oball grow out of hit rooto, and the Spirit
of the Lord ahall reot upon Him, the Spirit
of wt.dom and underatandibg, the Spirit of
counael and mJsbt, the Spirit of lulowlodga
and or the fear of the Lord ; and oball
make Him of quick underatoudiq,ln the

the rod of bio mouth, and with the breath
or hlo lipoohall He olay the wicked; and
rlgbteouoneoo aball be the ginlle of bil
loina, and falth.fWneoo the girdle of blo
rein~.'•
And wh&t then results with regard to
the kingdoms of this world ? Even
th&t which had been described in
Da.niel vii., where it is said, " Their
dominion is taken aW&y, but their
lives are prolonged for a season &nd a
time." The wild beuta th&t had
been ravening upon the mount&ina of
Iar&el, are deprived oftheir evil power;
&nd are made to asaociste quietly
with the children ofpeace. Here they
are each of them mentioned, &nd that
&gain in the same order as they lie
from our dwelling in the north-west.
The fuurth beast hath ita terribleneaa
removed, and is simply spoken of as
the wolf, whereby Rome wu ordi-
n&rily represented. After which, we
have the leopard-bear--and lion,-
their evil nature taken aW&y by the

The prophet had been speaking of
the glorious appearing of Messiah, to
exercise his beneficent reign; when
the poor in spirit aha.lJ. have the pro-
mised kingdom of heaven, and when
the meek shall inherit the earth. Pre-
pamtory to this, " He shall smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth; and
with the breath ofhis lips aha.lJ. he slay
TBB WICXBD."-This II8ID8 Wicked
ia also spoken of in Psalm L 16-23;
which compare with 1 Thesa. ii. 8.
Look also at Daniel vii. 8-lll, and
compare with what ia here aaid, Isaiah
zi. 9. All these pusagea speak of
the same grand coii.81UDID8tion of
tyranny,-that concentration of ini-
quity,-that personification ofwicked-
ness -in which the great empires that
hav~ lorded it over the land and peo-
ple of Iarael terminate. The bond of
wickedness ia then broken; and those
that had been as wild beasts preying
upon the mountains of Iarael,-the
Roman wolf,-the Grecian leoplll"d,-
the Median bear,-a.ndthe Babylonian
lion -are separated from each other ;
and'UBOOiated with those whose in-
ftnence is holineBB and peace. The
knowledge of the Lord destroys their
evil inliuence. They no longer seek
to ravage the holy mountain, butflow
up thereunto for leSBOns of love, and
to become more largely posseBBed of
the true riches. This destruction of
.Antichrist takes place in the north-
welt, from which the prophetic line
of empires stretches back eastward
along the north border of the land.
Thus, back and forward along thia
north-western line, are we constantly
led by the prophetic w~, down.~
the verytimeofthe Assyna.n captiVIty,
when laaiah prophesied; and that as
pointing forward to the time when
B 2
Shiloh aha.lJ. come in his glory; and
when unto him aha.lJ. the gathering
of the people be.
In Isaiah ix. 8-21, x. 1--4, there
is a very striking series ofparagraphs
each ending with,
" For all thla hla anpr Ia not tumed away,
But his hand Ia atretched out atlll."
Upon more minute examination, it
will be found that they consist each
of about fourteen lines, and may thus
be viewed 88 regular sonnets. They
refer to that house of Israel which, at
the time the words were spoken, wu
being taken away captive by tb.e .Aa-
syrians. They describe, in a very
animated manner, the several degrees
of the punishment of Ephraim; and
seem to give very clear indications of
the place of larael's sqjourn. The
first of these sonnets, 8-12, de-
scribes the punishment of larael, im-
mediately before being removed out
of the land. The second, 13-17,
describes their being cut oft' entirely
from the land, and also to the view
of the world, by the ABByrian cap-
tivity. The third, 18-21, describes
them when out of the land, 88 be-
ing at war, one portion with ano-
ther; and 88 being all of them against
Judah· which supposes them to be
grown lnto a number of hostile na-
tions, and in the same countries with
the JeWL The fourth, ch. x. 1--4,
seems to describe a dreadful courae of
trial, which would precede their great
deliverance; and for whichthey would,
probably, be unprepared. The first
points the words expreBBly at larael
or Ephraim (ver. 8-12):-
"The Lord aent a word into J"acob, and
It hath lighted upon Iarael. And all the
people ahall know-Ephraim and the ln-
habltanu or Samaria, that aay, In the

Thus was Ephraim in -the land, to
be so surrounded with thorns and
briers, as that a removal out of the
land, would, by many of them, be
rather accepted as a boon. Others of
them, however, would be loath to
leave the land of their fathers, at the
ll&llle time that they would not leave
their sins; and, for such, a more se-
vere judgment was prepared,-the
casting of the whole body of the peo-
ple forth of the land; the entire ex-
tinction of their glory as a nation:
and so the second of these sonnets
proceeds (ver. 13-17):-
"For the" people turneth not unto
him that amlteth them, neither do they
oeek the Lord of Hoste. Tuerefore the
Lord will cut off from Israel, head and
tail, branch and rush, in one day.
The ancient and honourable, he It the
head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail ; for the le•dera of the peo-
ple cauae them to err, and they that are
Jed ofthem are destroyed.
Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in
their young men, n.;,ither shall ha'fe mercy
on their fatherless and widows; for every
one is an hypocrite and an evil doer, and
every mouth spealteth fblly;
For all thia hiaanger Ia not turned away,
But bia hand ill atretched out still."
The entire removal of Israel having
thus taken place; and they having
l)een brought out into the northern
wilderness, weare next presented with
a view of their condition there, as
.stillundergoing punishment (ver. 18-
~1):-
" For wickednesa bumeth •• the fire; It
aball devour the briers and thorns, and
ahaII kindle in the thickets of the forest,
and they shall mount up like the mounting
up or smoke. Through the wrath of the
Lord of Hoattl i• the land darkeoed; and
the people shall be as the fuel of fire; no
man shall spare hia brother. And he
ah&ll snatch on the rlsht hand, and be
hunsry. and he shall eat on the left hand,
and they shall not be satisfied ; and they
ahall eat every man the flesh or his owu
arm: .Manaueh, Ephraim ; &Ad Ephraim,
Manasaeh; and they, together, ahall be
against Judah.
Forall thia hill anger Ia not turned away,
But bia hand ill 1tNtched out 1till."
This strikiugly describes the condi-
tion of the northern nations, at the
time of their being driven in upon the
Roman Empire. The slaughter and
rapine which resulted were prodi-
gious; during which the different na-
tions of Europe were drea.dfully
racked by wars with each other. But
however opposed amoug themselves,
they all united in persecuting the
Jews:-their power of doing which is
here plainly intimated.
The next, and last sonnet, carries
us forward to a more settled state of
things, to outward appearance; when
wrong would be perpetrated, not so
much by open violence, as by force of
law, and unjust legislation, to the in-
jury of the rights of the poor and
needy;-the depriving the poor of
bread, or the preventing their free
enjoyment of the word oflife. Glory,
and triumph, are spoken of; but that
in language full of warning; and,
upon which we have no pleasure in
dilating.-It may be that this (ch. x.
1-4) synchronizes with the third
woe, which cometh quickly,-referred
to in Rev. xi. 14.
"Woe 11nto them that decree unrighte-
ous decrees, and that write grievonaneaa
which they have preocribed ; to turn aside
the needy from judsment, and to take
away the ri8bt from the poor of my peo-
ple, that widows may be their prey, and
that they may rob the fatherless! And
what will ye do in the day of visitation,
and in the desolation whioh shall come
from farf To whom will ye flee for help t
and where will ye leave your glory f With-
out me they shall bow down under the
prisoners, and they shall fall under the
1lain.
Forall this hia anger ia not turned away,
But his hand il stretched out still.''
Thus are we, by this very interest-·
ing line ofprophecy, leddirectly to our
own part ofthe world, asto the place of
Israel's sojourn. Let it be again re-
marked, that the prophecy cannot ap-
ply to Israel, as being in some corner
of the earth, shut out entirely from
other people; and where they could
have no opportunity of manifesting
their hatred of their brethren, the
Jews. Nor can the words be fulfilled
in them as being under some mighty
empire; such, for example, as that of
China, where they would be without

the power ofwarring with each other,
or of letting Judah feel their power.
To no people does this series of songs
eo apply as to the nations of Europe.
Yes, although Israel seemed to be cut
off from hearing the word of God, the
word, after all, hath lighted upon
Israel. And Israel, even Ephraim,
shall know the truth of the word
which hath been spoken respecting
him.
Its being prophesied that the word
would light upon Israel, or Ephraim,
and that they would know that word,
is most consistent with God's purpose
reapecting Israel, as haviug been de-
signed to become the administrators
of that word to the nations. We
may, therefore, not expect to find
them out of the couree of that word;
but, as it were, in the highway
thereo£ Let UB, then, see if we can
discover this, the highway of the
word of God,-the great outgoing of
light to the world. If we glance at
Mimpriss's map, displaying the couree
of our Saviour's ministry, u de-
scribed in the Gospels, (a map abun-
dantly uaeful in other respects, and
not originally designed to illUBtrate
this particular subject,) we shall see,
at once, that these journeys all went
out northward. Although the greater
part of the tn"beship of Judah lay
eouth of Jemsa.Iem, we do not find
one journey of his, in that direction,
recorded, after the flight into Egypt,
in his infancy. It is northward,
through Samaria, that we trace the
oouree ofhisjourneys; and it is round
about the OOMts of the most northern
part of the land, Galilee, that he went
Freac:bing the glad tidings of the
kingdom, and healing all manner of
aioknesa and disease amoug the peo-
ple. And it WM when in his farthest
JOurney in that direction, on the OOMts
of Syro-phenicia, that he pronounced
the important words, " I am not sent
but to the lost sheep of the honse of
Israel." His mission wu, compara.-
tively, Mt to other people, a1 it tDal
to the lost bonse of tirael:-After the
sheep, who bad wandered into the
north oountr;;, were, ever and again,
drawn the feet of their good Shep-
herd, who came to seek and to save
that which wu lost. His mission
to the nations, promised to come of
Israel in the north country, wu more
fully carried out by his Apostlee.
Look at the great extent of Africa to
the south, and of Asia to the east,
where anciently existed mighty em-
pires; and where such myriads of
human beings have been produced:
and then look north-west, at this
comparatively small quazter of the
globe, Europe :-iUld look now at
Mimpriss'a most valuable map, de-
acribing the journeys of the Apostles,
as recorded in the Acts, and see,
again, how they all go out towards
our own part of the world. Journeys
may, doubtless, have been made to
other parts of the world, where scat-
tered portions of Israel were; but
the inspired record leaves, as it were
the world behind, and closes in our
attention towards this part of the
globe, in which the word of God was,
ultimately, so to take root, and spread
abroad, to every land; and this as
haviug reached the nations that we
811ppose to have come of J~b.
.Every Sllcoesaive journey was, as it
were, a farther development of the
gospel north-westward. It wu to
Sama.ria,-to Damascus,-toAntioch,
-to the cities of Asis Minor: and in
this oouree the Apostle wu divinely
inspired to proceed still farther; be-
ing constrained, as well u invited, to
pus over into Europe; and then
through the cities of Greece: and, in
short, from Jerusalem, round about,
unto lllyricum, wu it that be could
say, " I have fully preached the go&O
pel of Christ." The providence of
God led him farther atill in the same
direction, to Rome itsel£ But even
thiswu not to end hisjourneys hither-
ward; his purpose being to prooeedas
far west as Spain. Some have ha-
zarded the conjecture that be even
preached the gospel in Britain ; but
the Divine Record does not carry us;
at this time, so far. It may, perhaps,
be said that Paul wu lntluenoed to
proceed in this course, becanse here,

in the weat, wae the capital of the
empire, into connection with which
the Jews had then come. But this ia
not correct; for, independent of the
enpernatural in1luence in the cue,
which ia plainly avowed, we find,
(Rom. xv. 24,) that when Paul ex-
preaaed hie purpose in the matter, it
wae not eo much to make Rome the
epecial oqject of hie journey, 88 the
much farther point, Spain; and he
intended calling at Rome, 88 being on
his way to the more western country,
anciently called Tarshish. Paul, and
his fellow disciples, who ministered
the word of GOO that W88 to light
upon IaraeJ, we thus find, all followed
out the course indicated by the great
Shepherd of the sheep;-and that,
(being uniformly north-westward,)
directs our attention to our own part
of the world, aa being that in which
the lost sheep of Israel may be
found.
Thus far the spoken word : and
now, aa to the written word. It might
be expected that although no apostolic
journeys are recorded 88 being made
to the other more extensive and more
populous portions of the globe, that,
at leaat, some of the epistlea would be
sent into thoee quarters: but no. If
we look to Paul's Epistles, we find
them all sent out in the same course
aa were hie journeys ; all to placea
lying between ua and the land of Is-
rael. All point to this part of the
world, in which the grand doctrine of
free and full justification through the
blood of Jesus by faith,-where the
great doctrine advocated by this apos-
tle, has been so clearly brought out,
and proclaimed to the world. The
Epistle of Jamea is expressly sent to
larael; "Tothetwelve tribeswhichare
scattered abroad." This hath missed
ita direction, if it hath not come to
the places where the twelve tribes are
to be found,-if Israel be not among
the people on whom hath lighted this
word of God. It does not address a
people who have not heard the word
of GOO ; but a people making a great
profeaaion of faith,-but more strong
in doctrine than in practioe ; and re-
quiring to be aroused out of antino-
mian aluggishneu, into a more full
and consistent practioe of Christian
virtue; and especially into the brighter
exhibition of that spirit of love wbiob
becomes the GospeL It recognizes a
state of society very like our own ;
more like, than may be found in any
other part of the world. The Epistles
of Peter, which are sent to the same
royal priesthood-to the holy people
now scattered abroad, expressly pointe
northward:- being addressed, " To
thestrangersSC&tteredthroughoutPon
tua, Galatia, Cappadocia, .Asia, and
Bithynia,"-all placea in our direction
from the land of Israel. The Epistles
of John and of Jude, although no
names are given, are equally applic-
able as to their contents. It is here
that these, with all other parte of
Scripture, have been read, transJ.ated,
and spread abroad. It ia true, we aa
yet know but little of the Bible ; but,
more than any other people, we have
made it our own, and the things which
it saith, it saith to them that are
under ita hearing, whether with regard
to the law or the GospeL
To enm up all, we have our atten-
tion turned in the same direction
by the Apocalypse, that cloees the
volume of Inspiration. There we find
the good Shepherd, by his voioe from
heaven, amply confirming the indica-
tions of his personal ministry when
upon earth; and still expressing a pe-
culiar interest in the north-west; in
the north-west, in .Asia, over against
Greece, where the seven churches to
which were first directed the seven
epistles in the commencement of this
wonderful book..-And, by the mostes-
teemed commentators, the book ia
enpposed to proceed more and more in
the same direction, until it closes the
detail of judgment in our own part of
the world : when the grand mystery
of GOO is disclosed ; and the great
events of which all the prophets wit-
ness, speedily ensue. There is then
the effect of every vision ; and a
rending of the veil which hath been
spread over all people. The Book of
Revelation fi1le up the gap of prophecy

between the timea immediately IIUO-
~the first coming of Christ, and
preceding his aecond coming. Where
it enda the line ofjudgment, there may
Iarael most certainly be found :-the
11000nd appearing of Christ being so
intimately connected with the disco-
very of God's grand purposes with re-
gard to Israel, whom he shall then
have made ready to receive him, with
songs of everlasting joy;---u in Rev.
xv. 2--4:--

-Concisely to recapitulate:
If there be proportion between the
8600 of Abraham, and the other na-
tions of the earth : as is specially
avowed, with reference to Israel,
(Dent. xxxii. 8}-then are we led to
look for the lost children of Jacob,
among Japhet's posterity, in the north-
ern portion of our globe. Again : it is
assumed that the Restoration of Israel
shall be one of the grand consumma-
tions of prophecy-of those prophecies
whose tenour has reference to a bene-
ficial change of fM ""71face ofrw.tuN,
and which affect tmi'M"«Jl mankind;
the whole creation groaneth and tra-
vaileth together, until now, " waiting
for the manifestation of the eons of
God," (Rom. viii. 19, 22 ;) when, in
the place where it was said unto them,
-" Ye are Lo..-i (not my people
-Gentiles,)"-it shall be said unto
them,-" The sons of the living God!"
I -when the children of Iarael, and the
children of Judah, shall all J>egathered •
together, nuder one Head ;-when
" great shall be the day of the seed of
God," Hos. i. 10, 11). If so, then are
we led to look for the lost house of
Israel,--and especially, for Joseph's
posterity- here in the north-west :
for the plain indications of Old Testa-
ment prophecy, and the whole course
ofits descriptions, allpoint}lorth-west-
wa.rd;-while the indications which
New Testament history presents, of
the personal ministry of Chriat,-the
" Good Shepherd" who came to seek
and to save " thewtlhBep of the house
of Israel rextended, as these indica.-
tions are, to similar purport, by the
full expression of apoatolio solicitude,
-of the "heart's desire" of those who
carried out from Jerusalem the minis-
tration of Christ's Gospel, as expresaed,
fervently, in the whole course of their
recorded preaching, and in their epis-
tolary communications, - both of
which were under the immediate di-
rection of the Spirit of God: all these
corroborate the inferences to be drawn
from the language of the Older Re-
cord.
If, therefore, the Word of God, as
containedin either the Old or the New
Testament, be intended to throw light
upon this interesting-this momentous
subject, which, from its uniformity, we
may justly infer it is designed to do,
-th.en are we of neoeuity led to look
for the lost sheep of the house of Is-
rael, in fM norlh-wu~in our own part
oft"M world, whither the Word of God
hath ever followed them, and where
the whole course of his Providence
testifies to this truth of the word of
Prophecy. .
He that scattered Israel, promised
to gather them, and keep them as a
ahepherd doth his flock. And He hath
indeed proved a shepherd to Israel ;
He hath led Josephlikeaftock. Upon
Him may we now in truth call,-
" Turn uo again, 0 God,
And cause thy race to abiDe,
And we ahall be oaved."

I JUVB eeen eeveral a.ccounts from
India, stating that there is a people
there, eeemingly about eeven thousand
in number, and scattered over the
country, from the neighbourhood of
Bombay, who are ealled Beni-Israel,
and are suppoeed to be a remnant of
the lost ten tribes. They are Mid to
be the descendants or eeven men,
and eeven women,-who, about six-
teen hundred years ago, were eaved
from shipwreck,on the COB8tnear Bom-
bay. They profeea to be of the tribe
or Reuben, and, consistently with
tbie, they eall more or their children
by th5 name than by any other. If
the facts be so with regard to the sig-
nal preservation or this portion of the
tribe of Reuben, the prayer orMoses,
for this tribe, seems to have been sig-
nally an.awered,-
" Let Reuben live, and not die."
At the eame time, they seem to have
fulfilled, in them, the words or Jacob,
Gen. xlix. 4 :-" Unstable as water,
thou shalt not excel." They seem to
be generally rather respectable in the
lower, or, perhaps, middle rank of so-
ciety. When they enter the army,
they are valued as muaicians, and ge-
nerally attain to the rank of native

officers: but none of them appear to
riee to great eminence, in any re-
spect. ~ a people, they eeem to have
been remarkably stationary, except aa
influenced by 8111'1'0unding eociety,
which baa led to considerable change
outwardly, even aa to religioWI wor-
lhip; whilat, eeeentially, they remain
the same. And among them have sig-
nally been preserved aome of those
cUlltoma belonging to ancient Israel,
with which it is most important to our
present inquiry that we should become
acquainted. The last required of these,
-those that regard the interment of
the dead,-ve those that will first en-
gage our attention. And indeed it is a
cnrious coincidence,that uponproceed-
ing northward from ~ and Me-
dia,(aa we have been directed in eearch
ofIsrael, after their political death and
burial,) the first remarkable objects
that strike our attention are tombs,
which, by their con.etruction, plainly
tell that once Israel lay there. With
regard to the Beni-larael, already re-
ferred to, it is thWI reported of their
funeral ceremonies:- When one of
them dies,-
" They wuh the body, Uld clolbe it
with white Jinen,layiDg it on a plllllk, Uld
canying it to the burying gmund. They
aiDg alternately an the way as they go,
• Hear, 0 Israel,' &c., Uld continue the
I&Die till the body is committed to ita ori-
ginal dlliL On the fourth day, I!OIIle of the
relaUona visit the grave, 8Dd perfonn the
foDowiug ceremony :-
"They raise up thegrave a foot high with
aand, Uld aft.erwarda cover it over with a
piece of white linen; then they take a liule
fire in a vessel or pot, and place it at the
head, eastward; they then burn incense,
daring which lime they collect in another
v~ a quantity of cllif~t kinds of grain,
With cocoa-nuts made mto small pieces,
Uld II~ of all kinds mixed together,
and aprinkle them over the grave, while
covered with the linen cloth ; then they re.
move the linen cloth which covers it, and
sprinkle over the grave a Jiule chunnan
mixed with water, which they have previ-
ously prepared, Uld then disperse.
" On the seventh day, they again visit
the grave ; but uae no ceremooy, with the
excepdon at a prayer, which ia od"ered up
•
lor the 10111 atthe deceued,itthere beazq
penon present able to perform the duty,
which ill oeldom the cue, owing to their
extreme igDonDce. They then go to it oo
more."
Were they to repeat their visits, and
leave what they thUll place upon the
grave, aa was probably the case in
more ancient times, then there would
be over it alternate layers of earth
and vegetable matter. The covering
the grave thus, eeema now, however,
to have degenerated into a mere cere-
mony. Let WI recollect that Israel did
not so much chooee to bury in the
earth merely; 88 in a cave, either built
of atones or dng in the rock. A atone
lay upon the grave's mouth, which
was eastward. The grave eeems to
have been covered by alternate layers
of earth, or sand, and vegetable mat-
ter,-the sand being the first laid on;
which manner of covering their dead
may have been adopted, the better to
preserve the interior of the tomb from
damp:-and over the grave, in distin-
guished cases, they were accuatomed
to raiee high heapa,-both, perhaps, to
eerve 88 a monument, and also the
better to preeerve the tomb from spo-
liation. Now let WI, with the intelli-
gent traveller, Dr. Clarke, visit the
country immediatelybeyond the Cau-
casian mountains, directly north-west
from the places to which Israel were
carried by the ~a. Here are
immenee pl&ins, producing the moat
beautiful herbage, and apparently ca-
pable, with cultivation, of SUlltaining
immense multitudes; but they are now

eastern aide, they discovered the entrance
to a large arched vault, of the moat admi-

ecend into this remarkable sepulchre. Ita
mouth was balC 1illed ~th earth, yet, after
passing the entrance, there was llllllcient
apace for a person ':<' atB:Dd upright. Far-
ther, towards the mterior, the area was
clear, and the work perfectly entire. The
material orwhich the masonry consisted,
was a white crumbling limestoue, auch as
the country now a.ll'orda, 1illed ~th frag-
ments of minute shells. Whether It was
the work of Mileaians, or od!er colonies of
Greece, the alrill need in ita construction·is
very evident. The atones of the aides are
all oquare, perfect in their form, and put
together ~thout any cement. The roof
exhibits the finest turned arches imagin-
able, having the whiteneaa of the purest
marble. An interior vaulted chamber is
separated from the outer, by means of two
pilasters, swelling out ~de towarda their
bases, and placed, one on each aide, at the
entrance. The inner chamber is the larger
of the two.

progress then made in metallurgy, and in
the art of letting precious atonea,-at the

" Similar tombs are found on all the

which I have described are many others,-
and some nearly or equal size. Pallas, in
his journey over this country, mentions the
&equent recurrence of such appearances
all round the Bay ofTaman. Indeed, it
would be vain to ask where they are not
observed. The size, grandeur, and riches

I was somewhat at a 1086 to ascer-
tain the connection with our subject,
of this golden serpent, the ouly re-
markable object found in the tomb
seen by Dr. Clarke: but I observe that
the Beni-Israel in In~ are accused
of having, each of them, in his secret
chamber, a ailver serpent,-to which
they burn incense twice a da;r, and
throw a little B.ower before it,-e.nd
sing, BCCOmpanied with a small tom-
tom beating during the ceremony. Nor
is this strange ; as, even in the other
house, that of Judah, the same super-
stition appears to have long continued.
It was not until after the ten tribes
had been carried away, that Hezekiah
aroee, of whom it ia recorded, (2 Kings,
xvili. 4,) "He brake in pieces the bra--
Ben serpent that Moses had made: for
unto those days the children of Israel
did burn incense to it. And he called
it Nehushtan :"-s piece of brass.

man ; in the neighbourhood of which
there are other placeswhose names ar-
gue a Hebrew origin. They stretch
from the Kuban, northward, to an im-
mense distance,-e.nd the direction
they take seems clearly to indicate
that the people who there deposited
their dead, proceeded, not eastward,
towards Siberia, along the back of the
Caspian -, but, with the usual tide
ofemigration, westward,along the back
of the Eu.xine.
Here, in addition to the Aig1 '-P'
already noticed, we have toay-markl
sufficiently legible. The names of all
the great rivers in this neighbourhood
eeem to refer to the Jordan, as being
the original seat of the people,-wbo,
before the great migration of nations
westward, inhabited the conntry north
of the Eu.xine, between the Don and
the Danube. Thus, proceeding west-
ward from the Don, we have the Da.-
nez, B.owing into the Don itself:-
fartber in the same direction, there is
the Danieper,contraotedly, Dnieper;-
atill farther westward, we meet with
the Daniester, or Dniester: -and
southward from thence, and B.owing
from the far west, we have the Danube,
or Danau,-which, I have beard, the
Germans understand to mean the river
Noah; as if the people who gave it
this name had, after bearing much
tossing and great allliction, expected
to find here rest and comfort. Much
of this district, which appears to have
been anciently well inhabited, has but
few men left; in it. It has been so en-

tions. This store-bouse, however, is

of the dreadful incursions of the bar-
barous tribes from the ea.st,-who
have, since, mainly, possessed it as pas-
ture ground. And in this work of de-
atrnction, thesebarbarianswere assisted
by the great empires that have been
called civilized ; who, by their mur-
derous inroads into this country pre-
viously, had inclined the inhabitants
to seek a place in the inhospitable
north ; whence they rebounded upon
their destroyers, and have possessed
~hemselves of their possessions. They
.carried with them their civilization-
their free institutions-their superior
intellectual capacity and moral consti-
tution, even to the frozen regions of
Iceland, rather than inhabit a fertile
. land subject to barbarian sway.
The quarter in which we can ob-
tain the most distinct view of this
people, in very ancient times, is, per-
haps, on their southern frontier, that
neareet Greece. Here, along the south
bank of the Danube, between this river
and the mountains of Hamms, the
country was anciently called Mresia;
and the description given of the ruling
race inhabiting this district, is corre-
spondent to the idea. of their having
been Moses' disciples. The account
which Herodotus gives of the Gete,
the same with the people afterwards
called Goths, isin the following words.
He is describing the progress of Da.-
.rius, northward, in his wanton inva.-
aion of these people. (See Melpomene,
par. xciii, iv):-
" Before be arrived at the Ister, he ftrst
of all subdued the Getre, a. people who pre.
tended to immortality. 'The Thracians
oC S&!mydeosus, and they who live above
Apollonia, and the city of Mesaambria,
with those who are called Cyrmianians
and Mypsalans, submitted themselves to
Darius, without resistance. The Getal
obstinately defended themselves, but were
100n reduced : these, of all the Tbracians,
are the bravest and most upright.
" They believe them...Jves to be immor-
tal ; and whenever any one dies, they are
of opinion that be is removed to the pre.
aence of their god Zamolxia, whom eome
believe to be the eame with Gebeleizes.
Opce in every five yean they \)boose one
by lot, who ia to be despatched as a mes-
senger to Zamolxia, to J~~ake known to him
their several want.•. And they seriously
believe that there is no other deity."
It is plain there is much of fable
mixed up with this account of the
Gete ; but these things appear clear
respecting them : that they were dis-
tinguishedfrom the surrounding people
by their religion. They were called
immortals, because of their confident
belief in a. future state. They were
also distinguished for their moral rec-
titude, and for their bra.very in war;
at the same time they seem to have
been highly improved in the ~ of
peace. The Scythia.ns around them
were chiefly pastoral ; but these pro-
duced grain, not merely for their own
consumption, but for exportation. But
that for which they seem to have been
most remarkable, was, their being the
followers of Za.moxes, or Za.molxes, or
Zalmoxis, after whom the country ap-
pears to have been called. This Za.-
moxes is said to have left to. these
Gete, the institutions of their religion
in books, the loss of which is much
lamented by the learned ; but which,
it is most probable, we have in the
first five books of our Bible. There
seems to be some confusion as to the
name of this their great tea.oher,-and
also, as to whether he should be
reckoned the object of their worship,
or merely their religions instructor,
Such confusion of idea. is nothing re-
markable among the heathen; and has
been abundantly manifested in their
accounts of the Jews. In the present
instance there was the greater liabi-
lity to error, on account of the like-
ne99 between the sound of the words,
Za. El-Moses-the God of Moses-and
Za. Moses-Zamoxes, simply "that
Moses." It may be remarked that
from this quarter, including Thrace,
came the principal of the most early
poets and musicians, such as Orpheus,
who are said to have so assisted in
charming the previously rude inhabi-
tants of Greece, into the mildne99 of
civilized life. In later times, also,
they were still remarkable for musical

talent; 10 that the Greeks were in the
habit of hiring from this qll&lW", men
to mourn at their funerals. In other
respects, aa in gardening and architec-
ture, they seem to have been of very
great service to the Greeks.
Macedonia., the original inheritance
of Alexander, lies between Mresia and
Greece; and, previous to that prince's
turning himself to settle matters fully
in Greece, andpassing overto make his
conquests in the east, he went, we are
told, northward,and subdued the coun-
try as far as the Danube. The inha-
bitants ofthis country were too proud
to submit to national servitude, how-
ever willing many of them may have
been to labour individually for hire,
and accordingly they passed over the
Danube towards the north, choosing
rather to enjoy their beloved freedom
in a colder clime, than retain their
former homes under the Macedonian
yoke.
Those who remained were, ofcourse,
the dregs of the people, perhaps the
mere Aborigines; and this may have
caused the name of Thraci&u and
Mcesian to sink ultimately into disre-
spect. A principal portion of those
who withdrew beyond the Danube,
were called Getre, most likely of the
tribe of Gad. These Getre, we have
said, are identified with the Goths, who
were thus early made again to wander
forth in search of another resting-
place. North of the Danube was a
powerful and extensive republic, an-
ciently called Dacia, and the people
Davi, afterwards Daciaus. But, when
comfortably seated in this more north-
em abode, they were attacked by the
next great masters of the world,-the
Romans, who not only made Mresia a
Roman Province, but, attacking Israel
in Dacia, the country north of the
Danube, they drove them still farther
into the wilderness. .After a most vio-
lent struggle, which lasted for several
years, Dacia was at length nominally
subdued. Multitudes of the brave
Daciaus, who were taken captive,
were condemned to suffer cruel deaths
in the theatre, for the amusement of
the Romans;-no wonder they hated
the rule of mch conquerors. Their
king, rather than bow hie neek to the
Roman yoke, like many of the Jews
at the destruction of Jerusalem, de-
stroyed himsel£ The inhabitants, who
had withdrawn for a time northward,
returned, many of them, afterwards,
and made the retention of the province
10 troublesome to the Romans, that
they ultimately resigned their con-
quests north of the Danube; when a
considerable number of the original
inhabitants, it is presumed, re-settled
quietly in the land. Quietne88, how-
ever, was not allowed them, partly
from internal troubles, and partlyfrom
external &88&ults. The people, among
them that 10nght peace, seem princi-
pally to have settled farther north,
where they planted commonwealths,
much aft.er the lsraelitish pattern; •
in Germany, Sweden, and along the
western coast of Europe.
The banks of the Danube, on which
Israel appear to have been previously
given rest, after the tossing of their
captivity,wasalso the plaoefrom which
Israel was appointed to spread into
power, so as to poesess the gates of
theirenemies, and merit eminently the
title of Jacob, or supplanter, and that
at the moment of their greatest extre-
mity. When released in Dacia from
the Roman yoke, Attila and his Hone
came pouring down upon them from
the wilds of Tartaey, in fill' Asia, and
swept them as with a besom of cle-
struotion from off the face of that
whole land, where they afterwards re-
mained ouly in corners. The Servi-
ans, a more slavish race, came into
their po88e&sions, under the shadow of
the rude barbarian power, which, how-
ever, soon paased away like a rolling
thing before the whirlwind. This blast
of the terrible ones was most severe,
whilst it lasted; and was, indeed, like
a storm against the Roman wall, upon
which it precipitated the Goths to such
a degree, that they were glad to beg
for shelter from that people by whom
the bones of their brethren had been
heretofore scattered at the grave's
mouth, as when one cutteth and
cleaveth wood upon the earth. What

greatly conduced to the ftight of the
Goths, was the horrific appearance of
the H11118. This made the be&utiful
Goths flee from them 88 they would
b&ve fled from the face of a serpent.
They wanted not courage to meet a
foe of their own kind; but they ap-
pear to b&ve doubted the propriety of
having much intercourse with such
monsters in human shape, whose pol-
luting habits, also, they may b&ve been
glad to shun. They begged to be al-
lowed a shelter within the bounds of
the Roman Empire. The Roman em-
peror, with seeminggenerosity, granted
their request. The Goths were re-
quired to deliver up their arms. It
W88 also stipulated that their children
should be given to the Romans, and
dispersed through the provinces of
Asia. These terms were b&rd to a
br&ve people, and a people so affec-
tionate to their ofFspring as the Gotha.
Ere they could submit to them, they
must b&ve been reduced to the utmost
extremity. They seem,.however, to
have been faithfully observed, until
perfidy appeared on the part of the
Romans. The children of the nobility
.were separated without delay from the
multitude, and conducted to the dis-
tant plaees a.saigned for their resi-
dences.
The emigrants spread themselves
over the uncultivated plains between
the ridges of Mount Hsemus and the
Danube, in the same country from
which they bad been driven by the
Macedonian in his early conquests.
Here, in the land of their fathers, they
seem to have been olfered little but a
grave, into which it was threatened
they would fall by one of the most
fearful of deaths,- that of hunger.
When they accepted of the b&rd con-
ditions already alluded to, they were
promised provisions for their immedi-
ate supply ; but these came far short
of the demand. They bad to expend
all to purchase food ; and at length,
many of them bad to sell themselves
as slaves, in order to preserve a miser-
able existence. Was such a state of
things to be endured, if it could be a.t
all mendedP At length, insult wu
added to injury-they became exaa-
perated-tr.nd in their desperation be-
gan to concert desperate measures.-
These, the Visigoths, at length pro-
cured assistance from the Ostrogoths,
who bad not been admitted within the
Roman Empire ; and who, of COllr!!e,
still retained their arms. Wa.r was re-
solved on. They fought and overcame.
In the mean time, the Gothic yontb,
dispersed over the .Asiatic provinces,
were, by order of the Roman Govern-
ment, all, in the most atrocious man-
ner, slaughtered. We are accustomed
to talk of the barbarism of the Goths,
and of the rntbless hands they laid
upon the Roman empire. But was not
vengeanoe to be looked for in return
for so much cowardly cruelty, with
which these strangers were treated in
the land of their fathers, by the mas-
ters of the world ? .And acoordingly,
.Alaric, King of the Visigotbs, was
raised up for the correction of the Ro-
mans. To this offioe he reckoned him-
self specially called, calling himself
the Fire of God, and the Scourge of
Rome, which he abundantly was,
weakening it in various parts; and es-
pecially ravaging Greece, and thus
punishing in their children the ancient
dispossessors of his fathers, when .Alex-
ander led his conquering arms into
Moosia. At length .Alaric marched
upon Rome itself, and, after twioe spa-
ring it, and repeatedly meeting with
treachery and insult, he at length
sacked and plundered the city, carry-
ing away an Immensity of treasure.
The Goths themselves, behaved, it is
said, with much mildness and huma-
nity; but the barbaria.na, whom .A.lario
bad joined to his army, ran into great
excesses, the blame of which the Goths
have in a great measure borne.
In the mean time the barbarians,
who had caused the emigration of the
Gothic nations, rolled many of them
over the empire, sweeping away many
mingled people. Some passed over to
Africa, which they conquered, or ra-
ther ravaged ; whence returning, un-
der Genseric their prinoe, Rome again,
and still more severely, sulfered. Even

aalte of its gildedb!'IIS8; and the aacred
vessels, belonging to the temple at Je-
rusalem,-thespoilsthat Titus brought
to Rome, and that AlAric, because of
their holiness,refused to touoh,-these
are amoug his trophies ; but a storm
deposits them in the bottom of the
Great Sea. And at length this barba.-
rous power, that threatened to erect
an empire, embracing both sides of the
Mediterranean, and which would have
made, perhaps, Africa the seat of em-
pire, is meltedaway, and can no more
be found. Such has been the fate of
all the nations that so came, like a
aweeping atorm,-a. furious whirlwind,
to drive l.arael intoendleasruin. They
have passed away like a night vision.
All their mighty conquests are now
but as a troublous dream. Even
the Roman eagle, which, under her
wide-spreading wings, proffered a re-
fuge to Israel, in such mockery of hoa-
pitality and truth, is now as nothing ;
whilst the poor and needy hath, in-
deed, taken root, and spread and flou-
rished, as was promised. Would that
their fruit were such as becomes the
children of so many mercies!
Spain, as well as a considerable por-
tion of Italy, came into the posaession
of the Goths. Gaul was laid hold upon
by the Franks, another branch of the
same great family, andfrom them, has
been called France. Britain came into
the possession ofthe Anglo-Saxons, at
least as to the largest and most valu-
able part ofit; and from themhas been
called England. The Gothic nations
were, in the course of the revolutions
we have briefly sketched, driven in
ohiefly towards the north, where they
ereoted free commonwealths, in what
was anciently called Cimbria and
Scandinavia, which they civilized, and
rendered comparatively fruitful ; but
from which many ofthem rebounded
back, by sea, upon the more fertile
countriesofEurope,-makiugnot ouly
great depredations, but in some caees,
as in that of Normandy, large con-
questa. By one means or another,
and mostly asiffrom necessity, Europe
has fallen almost entirely, into their
possassion; and from thence have they
spread themselves over gnm part of
the other quarters of the globe. The
great mpplo.ntirlg has been ever going
forward. This people have, indeed,
been Jacob from the beginning, but
particularly since their settlement
within the bounds of the Roman em-
pire. It is espeoially north of that,
however, that they have displayed the
most mental power. This mental
power has, as we have seen, been in
training from the earliest period,-in
order U!at they might be prepared for
acting under the other name of Jacob,
-that of Iwael, or Prince of God.
They are to be made princes in all
the earth, according to the order of
the kingdom of heaven; according to
which, the greatestof all is to be as the
servant of all; even like the Prince of
the kings of the earth, " who came not
to be ministered unto, but to minister,
and togive his life a ransom for many."
God is already proceeding to lay
liberally to their hand,-not for self
glorification, or luxurious ease,-but
that they may enjoy the high dignity
of being the dispensers of the Lord's
bounty to mankind. May they soon
fulfil their destiny, and be given to
rule in judgment, under the King of
righteousness,-justifYing the pre-
diction, " The people which shall be
created, shall praise the LordI "
Only look for a moment at the im~
portant position which this people now
occnpy,-whose name but lately w.S
a name for barbarism. They posseae
the most improved portion of our
globe,-the greater part of which was
but a wilderness when they took poe-
sassion of it. There is scarcely any
plaoe ofmuch importance, in any part
of the world, that they do not now
ocoupy,--81Cept, indeed, their own
land of Israel, and those laid . hold
uponby their great'rival, in the North.
east portion of the world; and who,
as grasping at the whole, is yet to act
so important a part at the olose
of the present dispensation. Israel
have .colonized, or are colonizing
all the new world; and great part of
Asia is in their possession: whilst
Africa is in a D)allller surroUIJ.ded by

them. Either directly, by power,-
or indirectly, by diplomatic agency,
they can control almost all the nations
of the earth. All the facilities ofgood
appear to be rapidly providing. It is
true there is a deadness, unworthy of
this position. There is, as it were,
the silent waiting for the powerful
word of the living life-giving God:
" Come from the four winds, 0 breath,
and breathe upon these slain that they
may live." Now may Mohammedan
delusion depart, and Ishmael associate
with Isaac, in his efforte to raise unto
the full dignity of man, the long-
oppressed children of Africa. Nmv
may the Brahmins, the younger chil-
dren of Abraham, in the east, behold
the truth of their perverted allegories,
and become efficient missionaries to
all the families of Shem, so densely •
crowded into that part of the world.
Now may the Jews spread every-
where, knowing all countries, all lan-
guages, all customs, and all engage-
ments of mankind, turn their pene-
trating minds unto the truth, as it is
in Jesus, and labour to bestow upon
all, the true riches, as they have
laboured to acquire for themselves the
mammon of unrighteousness. Now
may Judah walk with Israel,-and
may they come together out of the
north country, to the name of the
Lord, to Jerusalem; and thence go
forth, as lightning, to the utmost
comers of the earth, as vessels of
honour fit for the Master's use,-to
carry out blessings unto thtl ends of
the earth; to preach the gospel of the
kingdom in all the world for a witness
unto all nations, before the end come.
But to return:-
It may be objected that if these
things are so, there will surely be some
traditional remains among t,jlis people,
tending to prove their lsraelitish
origin. With regard to the Sctiptures,
which it is most desirable we should
find them possessed of; we have the
parallel case of Judah. It wonld
seem that, even in that portion of
God's peculiar people, the word ofGod
was so scarce, that when a copy of it
was found, in the ~gn of Josiah, it
11'
was as if some remarkable discovery
had been made. (See 2 Kings, xxii.
8-20.) Upon theirretnm from Baby-
lon, also, it plainly appears that they
had, up to that time, been remarkably
wanting as to Scriptural knowledge.
See Ezra ix. If this was the case
with regard to the Jews who retained
Jerusalem,-the place ofrnle, and the
place of worship,-who had the best
opportunities of being instructed in
what God had done for his people in
the days of old, and what he had
appointed them to observe as the
symbols of allegiance to himself, the
Lord of Hosta,-the great Governor
among the nations; less forgetfulness
could scarcely be expected of the
other-the fugitive house of Israel;
whowere ever in astate ofchange;and
who had become so separated from the
wors:lip of God, previous to their re-
moval out of the Land. Although
they, however, are not known to have
had the books of the Scriptures ac-
tually in their possession,-yet it
might be expected they should have
traditions ofanother kind. This might
be the more expected, as Elijah and
Elisha chiefly prophesied in lsrael,-
not in Judah: and their prophecies
would more naturally regard the
people among whom they ministered;
rather than the other house--that of
Judah, to which they did not minister,
-and who have no record of their
prophecies.
However adulterated by heathenish
admixture, something might be ex-
pected to remain among these north-
ern nations, of the traditions of their
fathers, to attest the truth we have
been advoca.ting,-and accordingly
this is remarkably the case. The
oldest poem these people are known
to possess, appears to have been pro-
duced with the special design of col-
lecting the traditions of their fathers.
It is called VOLUSPA; that is the spae
or rrophecy of Vola. The Edda ia a
comparatively modern commentary
upon Voluspa, containing, perhaps,
nearly as mauy fables superadded, as
the correspondent works of the Jews
and the Romanists, who have, by their
D1g1tized by Coogle

'f8.in traditione, 110 made void the word
of God. It commencea thus:-
" Be .Uent, I pray, all holy creatureo,
Greater or amaH, 8001 of Heimdallar !
I will tell of the devicea of Valfodar,
The ancient discourses of men,
The earliest I know."
It then prooeeda to deecrille the rising
of thia creation out of chaoer-the
~eparation of the light from darkness;
·- d the appointment of times and
aeasons. Then there f1>llows much in
very enigmatic language, adverting
occuionally to incidents recorded in
Scripture, aa to the oaae ofJudah and
Tamar, Ulltil it comes to what may
have been specially derived from the
prophesying of Elijah,-and then the
language becomes comparatively clear,
and the meaning more apparent. Thus
it then proeeeds:-
[Capti•e lorael cut out Into the northem

" She saw the bouDd one,
Lyiag under the Grove of the HDDI.
The perfidious fimeral.-
One, like Lok.
There sat, as Sigynia,
Never dear to her husband.
Know you more? What is it?"
Having been brought out into the
north country, into the vast plains
northward of the Caucasian moun-
tains, and been given there an appa-
rently peaceable aettlement,-there is
then the rushing of many waters,-of
the fieroe barbarians from the east,
that inundate these plains, and sweep
the people to which the prophecy
appliee, in towards the north ; and thus,
accordingly, the poem proceeds:-
" A river ftowa from the eut,
Over poisoned nlea,
Carrying mud and ~;
It is called Slidur."
rPromlH of a refuse In the north.-]
·" There staudo towards the north,
·In Nidafiollum,
A golden palace, named Sindra ;
But auolher exists in Okolni,
The ale-cellar of the Jotun,
Which is called, Brimir.'"
lDisappointed u to the ohtalnlng the pro-
mioed refuge in the north.-]
"Sbe aaw a palaoe ltiDd!ar from the IIID,
In Nastrondum ;
Itlooka at the doors of the north.
The building is twisted from the spines of
serpents,
Poisoned torrents
Flow through ita windows:
[Dreadful otate or aociety, u minsled

" Thereshe saw, amid the dreadful s1leama
The peljured and the murderers, '
And tho!e that pull the ear&
or another's wife.
There Nidhoggur
Tore the flesh from the corpoes.
The fierce Wolf devoured the men.
Know you more? It is this."
.Af\er much more to the II&IDe purpose,
the poem then goes on to dei!Cribe the
fulfilment of the words of l.eaiah, ix.
18-21; to which alllllion was made
in last lecture.
" Brethren will fight and slay e&.ch other;
Kindred will !!purn their consanguinity·
Hard will be the world ; '
Many the adulteries.
A bearded age, an age alswords:
Shieldo will be cloveo.
An age al winds, an age of wolves,
Till !he world ohall perish,
Therewillnotbeonethatwilll!p&re auolher."
Farther on, we have an account of
those dreadful convulsions of the
:material creation, which shall precede
the full eetabliahment of peace, and
bestowment of blessing. There is atiJl
a mingling of heathen fable with the
truth of prophecy; but, through that,
this may all the while be diacemed.
" The sun darkens ·

And talked of the world"a great calamitiea;
And oC the ancient rune of Fimbultyr.
These thiJit!s done, the wonderful dice,

Then the earth yielda her increase;
and want and woe are felt no more:-
" There were ftelda without iowing,

" The Asae will dwell without evils,

Then the two brothers, Judah and
Joeeph, are made one; and cbooee for
them one head, and are given the pro-
mised headship over the heathen:-
"Then Heinir sha:rea the power of choosing

So clearly, indeed, b&ve the tr&di-
tions of these nations heen related
to the contents ofour Bible, that it was
at one time supposed the northern
nations b&d become acquainted with
them through the medium of Chris-
tianity. Such a supposition is however
now abandoned; and thus do these

God " hath not seen iniquity in J a.cob ;
neither perveraeness in larael:"-not
that there was none there; but, in his
grace, "He hath clothed him with the
robe of righteoUBiless." He hath be-
held him in the Righteous One-the
multitudinous seed, in the One Seed,
Christ.
In the succeeding verses, (5-9,)
there is described the consternation of
these countries; and their vain super-
stitions recourse to images, which
began then to multiply in the churches
--Q}Jed Chriatian,-but from which
the spirit of Christianity seems to have
almost entirely vanished, at the time
the Gothic race broke in upon Western
Europe. This people, who had, as
was prophesied, lost their name of
larael, are repeatedly pointed to
their origin; and they have, also, their
end, or the purpose of God with regard
to them, declared. Too many ofthem,
however, have, like Israel in Canaan,
learned the way of the heathen, whom
the Lord cast out before them.
"The ialea aaw, and feared;

Israel is here pointed forward to his
higher destiny than the being the
lerV&IIt of idols. He is chosen to be
the servant of the living God. And
he is one, between whom and God
none may interpoee. • He is chosen of
God. &nd delighted in by Him, as the
seed of .Abraham, his friend, with
whom He condescended to have fami-
liar intercourse. He is chosen of
God,-who, in opposition to all human
unbelief, here emphatically declares,
" I kiJH Mt etut tAu oiiXJ!I." The
complete supplanting ofthe enemy, of
whose gates he has been given the
poBBession, is then described, (ver-
10-12):-
" Fear thou not; for I am with thee :
Be not dismayed ; for I am thy God:
J will otrengthen thee,
Yea, J wUI help thee,
Yea, I will uphold thee with tho right hand
or m,. rlgbteouoneu.

Thou ohalt ...k them.
And ohalt not lind them,
Them that contended with thee:
ne,. that war &lainot thee ohall be .. no-
thing,
And ao a thing of noaghL"
The powerful instrumentalitywhereby
this great supplanting would be efFect-
ed, is next pointed out. All di1Boul-
ties would be removed, and swept
away; and Israel would take root, and
flourish, as was promised, (verses
1a--16):-
" Por I, the Lord thy God, will hold thy
right hand,

Fear not thou worm Jaeob,-ye men of

vernment, new laws, new manners, new
dresses, new languages, new names of men
and countries, were every where intro-
duced. To make a. great or sudden alter-
ation with respect to any of these, unless
where the ancient inhabitants of a country
have been almost totally exterminated, has
proved an undertaking beyond the power
of the greatest conquerol'3. The great
change which the settlement of the bar-
barous nations occasioned in the state of
Europe, ma.y therefore be considered ..., a.
more decisive proof than even the testi-
mony of contemporary historians, of the
destructive violence ...;th which these in-
vaders carried on their conquests, and of
the havoc which they had made from one
extremity of this quarter of the globe to the
other."-View of the Stale of Europe,

The immense Increase of these
northern nations ha.s been acknow-
ledged, on all hands; and different
theories have been formed to account
for it , and, also, for how they could
have been contained in the north, from
which they seemed to issue in such
myriads. If they had, in truth, been
produced and sustained solely in the
north, this would have been no less a
miracle than the feeding of their fa-
thers in the wilderness of Sinai, pre-
vious to their being given possession of
the land of Canaan. But we plead for
no such miracle. There is no neces-
sity for this, when we allow them the
position we have pointed out, in the
east of Europe, immediately behind
that great wa.Il of empires, by which
the way of Israel wa.s so long hedged
up, that she could not find her paths.
Sir William Temple supposes these
nations had increased by an indiscri-
minate commerce of the sexes, or by
a plurality of wives; whilst directly
the contrary of all this was the case,
-these people being remarkable for
chastity in their own homes; and with
regard to polygamy, we see that, a.s in
the case of the Turks, this may rather
tend to the decrease of the population.
l!e supposes that men will increase
faster as barbarians, than as being
civilized; which, facts seem abund-
antly to disprove. Look, for example,
to the case of the red and white .races
in Aljlerica: the former are rapidly
melting away before the latter, and
that whether they be at war with each
other, or living in peace. It may be
said that the North Americans, if not
at war with the Whites, are busy de-
stroying each other; but so also were
the northern nations, and yet they
continued to increase. It may again
be said, that the North Americans are
destroyed by an excessive use of ar-
dent spirits; but this excess also ex-
isted among these northern nations in
Europe, so that " a drunken Dane"
came to be a common expression; and
yet they continued to increase, and
overflow all around them. Nor is it
true, that they have now ceased to in-
crease. Their increase is indeed more
peaceable: but still it is onward, and
even much greater than before; only,
now they do not require to break
through the bounds of others, in order
to obtain room in which to dwell.
Having reached these maritime parts,
they spread abroad in every direction,
and plant themselves on every shore;
and colonize the globe. Their case,
either before taking possession of the
foreground of Europe, or since, clmnot
be accounted for, except upon the sup-
position, that the Lord " had a favour
for them," and that they are "the
seed which the Lord hath blessed."
That they are indeed the very people
we are in search of, will still farther
appear, if we consider the aspect of
society in Europe, after the RoiD&D
Empire had been entirely subverted;
and when the genius of this new peo-
ple had got full time to become deve-
loped. The face of society wa.s en-
tirely changed. Let us see whether
the character of these great changes
be fully consistent with the idea that
the people who produced them were ·
the children of those fathers whose
training we have traced. We sha.Il
now briefly advert to a few of the
more general outlines; and afterwards

more minutely, in the case of the
English nation.
We have seen that Israel were not
allowed to rest in the patriarchal form
of government. As soon as their cir-
cumstances allowed., they were accus-
tomed, first, to aristocratic rule, or
government bya few,-these being the
natural leaders of the people. They
had thereafter introduced among them
the democratic principle,-the people
delegating their power to men who
acted in their name, either for counsel
or judgment. Now one of the grand
changes which took place upon the
dissolution of the Roman Empire, was
the universal establishment of this
same mixed form of government.
" Wherever they seated themselves,"
observes Sir Wm. Temple, "they left
a constitution, which has since been
ealled, in most European languages,
the States; consisting of three orders
-noble, ecclesiastic, and popular, un-
der the limited principality of one
person, with the style of King, Prince,
Duke, or Count. The remainder at
least, or traces hereof, appear still in
all the principalities founded by these
people in Italy, France, and Spain;
and were of a piece with the present
oonstitutions in most of the great do-
minions on the other side the Rhine."
It maybe remarked, that the North-
ems claim, fur their Civil Institutions,
an origin in the most remote antiquity;
and that some of them have claimed
for them, as well as for the names of
some of their cities, an Israelitish
origin; Their Governments, like that
of Israel, were almost all representa-
tive or constitutional, a form peculiar
to Israel and the nations of Europe.
Their laws were strict; and adminis-
tered, in each nation, generally by
twelve judges, having appointed cir-
cuits, as we find recorded in the book
of Samuel. Their kings, like those of
Israel, were generally hereditary in
particular families; but the individual
was often determined upon by popular
election: and the kings were more
the principal agents in getting the law
carried into effect, and in conducting
the defence of the commonwealth,-
thanarbitrarymonarchs, making every
thing minister to their private gratifi.
cation. The people themselves, by
their minute subdivision into hun-
dreds, and tens; and by their mutual
subordination and oversight, exactly
analogous to what was the case with
regard to ancient Israel, greatly as-
sisted in the preservation of social
order : so that the civil condition,
at home, of these people, was often
strongly in contrast to the buccaneer-
ing or privateering excursions of the
more restless portions of them abroad;
of those who went forth to be avenged
on their great adversary, Rome, and to
take possession of the colonies of that
empire, which had so continually been
spoiling them of their own country,
and driving them in upon the inhos-
pitable north. Whether migrating, or
abiding at home, their form of society
seems to have had a most germinating
power. Every little band of them
formed a community, with rules, and
partition of duty, such as might enable
them either to maintain their present
position, or expand into a powerful
state, as occasion might require, or
circumstances allow. This subdivi-
sion of the people, and the association
of these little communities, for more
general purposes, into tribes or king-
doms, prepared the way for that as-
sociation ofcomparatively independent
states, as in the German empire; or
still more largely, in the great Eu-
ropean family of nations, with regard
to which so much has been spoken
about the balance of power.
Thus far with regard to Govern-
mentrand as to Property, the change
was equally characteristic of Israel:
among whom, although land was he-
ritable, still individuals had not abso-
1ute possession thereof. It seems to
have been reckoned a kind of public
property; those who held it owed cer-
tain duties to the state; they were
liable to be called out in its defence.
They thus were supported, in order
that they might support the common-
wealth. Civil offices might be paid for
in the same way as military services.
Thus were the people less liable to

taxation. Thua might all, from the
lowest to the high~ feel that they
were members of one whole; and that,
fur the good of the whole, they had
each duties to perform. Not only does
this seem to have been the oaee when
they were formerly in the land; but
such is again to be the case, as we find
it plainly written, even with regard to
the prince himaelf:-Ezek. xlv. 8;
" In the land shall be hie possesaion,
and my prinoee shall no more oppreee
my people." It need not be remarked
how naturally this accounts for the
feudal system, over the origin ofwhich,
among these nations, so much mystery
has hung. Feudalism universally pr&-
vailed among the nations who, af\er
the tempest had subsided, were found
settled in Western Europe. The feudal
eystem also prevailed equally among
those that were farther removed from
the Ro~, as among those that were
near. The principle among all was
this, that land was public property,
Cor which aerricee were due to the
1tate: to the king, as the represen~
tive of the state, by the great holders
ofland, in the first instance; and then,
through them, by the subordinate
holders; every one rendering hie ser-
vice to him that was immediately
above hiin, until it reached the throne,
which itself was supposed to be held
by the grace of God, as expressed in
the voice of the people. There was
wisdom in the contrivance, beyond
what could be expected to originate in
.barbarism, or mere chance. The eya-
tem, however, W88 doubtless abused;
and the great holders now retain the
property, without the trouble of ren-
dering the state any considerable r&-
compence for that with which they
were originally intrusted for the pub-
lic good. Among some of these peo-
ple, as, for example, in Norway, the
right of redemption, 88 in Israel, also
remained.
A like provision was made in Israel,
for the Ministers ofReligion: The Le-
vites had their own posseBBions in land
throughout the tribes, beside the free-
will offerings that might be presented
them by the people. They had also
much to do, 88 to the teaching and
administration of the law. Corr&-
epondent to this, is the change noticed
by Sir William Temple, to have taken
place in the state and provision of the
Clergy in Europe, af\er the embrace
of Christianity by the northern na.-
tions.
When thess nations were only, in a
manner, holding military posseBBion of
Europe, and had not fully established
their civil institutions, they had, (like
Israel in a similar situation, as in the
days of the Judges,) an order of men
assisting in the administration of jua-
tice, who could only be looked for
among a people, whose moral feelings
had been cultivated to a remarkable
degree. I advert to the order of Chi-
valry; to an order of men, who, sacri-
ficing personal eB&e, and all expec~
tion of private gain, went forth in
search of opportunities of ave~
wrong, and relieving the oppressed~
an order of men, combining in their
character, besides this remarkeble ilia-
play of conscientiousness and bene-
volence, the most courteous and chaste
regard for woman, and reverence fur
religion. With them, the sword was
consecrated by religion, to be wielded
by the most punctilious honour, in
.the support of morality. Chivalry,
doubtless, degenerated much into
empty parade and other abuses; but
withal, it W88 of immense use, in im-
proving the civil condition and social
intercourse of these nations, after the
confusion that accompanied their first
settlement in Western Europe.

hood was not more remarkable than

ance and protection of commerce.

tempt to t&ke possession of the l&nd;
in which they were put to sh&me,
&nd made to turn back from before
their enemies, into the wilderness,
until they h&d been so trained, u that
the l&nd could, consistently with their
true good, be given them in permanent
possession. From that time to the
present, the course of this people hu
been ever progressive. Their God
hu been ever, more &nd more, en-
riching them by his providence, &nd
unfolding to them, still more ole&rly
&nd l&rgely, the tre&sures of His
gr&ee. They h&ve been ever in &
course of improvement. Discovery
&nd invention have gone h&nd in
h&nd; &nd opportunities of conee-
cr&ting these to the good of m&n, &nd
the glory of God, hsve correspond-
ently &bounded. The providence of
God, equa.lly with the pl&in declara-
tions of His word, testifies, most dis-
tinctly, to the truth of our Israelitish
origin.
.AJ to L&nguage, it is gr&nted that
this could not of itself identify &peo-
ple; or distinguish Israel, for eX&m-
ple, from the C&n&&nites, wh& seem
to have spoken the 8&1Jle !&nguage
with th&t of ISI'Ml; nor does th&t of
B&bylon &ppe&r to have been gre&tly
different: &nd we know th&t the very
people referred to, have, in many
cases, changed their l&nguage; so th&t
the words used by & n&tion, in one
age, e&n se&rcely be understood by
their descend&nts in mother. Still
it m&y be expected th&t & sufficiency
would rem&in of the Hebrew, to tell
of this people's former aoqn&int&nce
therewith,-and such is the case. It
hu been observed by linguists, th&t &
very gre&t de&! of the &ncient !&n-
gnage of Israel exists in the modern
l&ngnages of Europe; &nd th&t it is
through & Gothic medium th&t this
plentiful supply of Hebrew hu come.
So much h&ve these !&nguages been
thrown into & Hebrew mould, that &
French Abbe hu l&tely proposed to
m&ke uae of the Hebrew, &S the gr&nd
key to these !&nguages,- that
whereby they m&y most euily be &e-
quired; md, it is a&id, he hu been re-
m&rk&bly successful.
The time of the Introduction of
Christia.nity &moug this \*l!lle is r&-
ther rem&rk&ble: it wu JUBt when it
wu f&diug &W&y into mere formalim:n
or superstition, in &11 other p&rts of
the world; &nd when, throughout the
e&St, it W&S being eugulphed by Mo-
h&mmed&nism, so &S to be thre&tened
with entire extinction in &11 its ori-
ginal ae&ta. Then did it re&eh these
n&tions-then did it t&ke root &mong
them,-and thence did they become,
emphatic&lly, Christendom. And,
contr&ry to &11 other people, their
course hu been progressive with re-
gard to religion, u it hu been with
regard to every thing else.
It need se&rcely be rem&rked, th&t
both Poetry &nd Muaic were gre&tly
cultiv&ted in Israel. These were &e-
oomplishments which, it might be ex-
pected, would be eminently possessed
by &people who were to be peculi&rly
devoted to the worship of God-the
Most High over &11 the e&rth: &nd
IICCOI'dingly, they, especi&lly the Ger-
mans, hsve been rem&rkable for mu-
aic&l t&lent, &nd p&rticul&rly &S to in-
&tnunellt&l music; &nd the genius of
their music &ppe&rs to be very much
like th&t ofthe Jews. With regard to
pc>etry, in &11 its varieties, these na..
tiona have been rem&rk&ble. Poetry
wu gre&tly cultiv&ted, even &moog
the oper&tives, in the cities of Ger-
m&ny. And in It&ly, lifter the genius
of the Gothic r&ce beg&n to develop
itself in verse, one of the most im-
port&nt ch&nges that we observe, is
the production of the Sonnet, or song
of fourteen lines, in which so much
wu written by Petr&rch. In the
8&1Jle age, Antonio a Tempo, &civi!i&n
&t Padua, who wrote on poetry, dis-
tinguishes sixteen different kinds of
Sonnet. Now, the like v&riety of thia
kind of composition preV&ils to &n im-
mense extent in the Scriptures, as hu
&bund&ntly been exemplified in the
course of these lectures. This might
still more l~~rgely be exemplified in
the songs of degrees in the Book or
Ps&lma. It will se&rcely be S&id th&\

these people learned to write sonnets
from their perusal of the Scriptures,
a& conveyed to them through a Chris-
tian medium: for, as far as I know,
these sonnets have lain unobserved
in the Scriptures from the time the
Bible was tirst circulated in Europe.
That kind of composition, along with
many others, amounting to above an
hundred, seems to have been pre-
served among the people of Israel,
during all their wanderings; although
they do not appear to have recognized
it in their own Sacred Writings, when
these were restored to them through
the medium of Christianity.
These are the people who have al-
ready been blessed with the choicest
blessings both temporal and spiritual.
When darknt'ss overspread the earth,
and gross darkness the people, it was
uponthem that thelight dawned, at the
time of the Reformation ; just as it
was towards their part of the world,
as we "have already seen, that the
preaching and the Epistles of the
.Apostles, all went forth at the begin-
ning of the Christian dispensation.
.And among them, or the people
sprung from them, did not only that
important change take place,-but
also, every revival in more modem
times. These are the people who
have shown the greatest adaptation of
mind for the study of the Scriptures.
They have not merely studied them
most for themselves,-they have
translated .them into almost every
tongue, and distn"buted them all over
the globe. They are, besides, most
in the position of waiting for the
coming of their Lord, &Dd the pro-
mised outpouring of the Spirit.
These are, certainly, much less than
they ought-still they are most in
the position commanded &Dd promised
to Israel.
Many, also, are the temporal bless-
ings which have been conferred up-
on this race;-the numberless dis-
coveries and improvements which
have sprung up among them, and
by them been distributed over the
globe. .Among the first of these
was paper, the very fine substance of
which books are now made; allowing
what would formerly have been a
rather exteftsive library, to be con-
densed into a volume, that may, with-
out inconvenience, be carried in the
pock'Ct; and that this may more effec-
tually be accomplished, and copies
multiplied at {comparatively) no )a..
bour and 'Cxpense,-they have been
given Printing. By steam power, the
process of printing has been still far-
ther facilitated, to &D immense extent,
and the .boob rapidly spread over
the land, and ·sent even afar over the
sea,-with almost the certainty of
their reaching their destination at the
appointed time. By the discovery of
steam power has the city been spread
all over the colintry, and the country
brought, as it were, into the city; &Dd
remote comers of the earth brought
into conjunction: whilst human la-
bour is lightened, and the conve-
niences of life are multiplied, to an
amazing extent. Nor could these ad-
vantages have been enjoyed, but for
the previous discowry of the compau,
by which the great waste of waters
can so easily be traversed;-and gun-
powder, by which all obstructions can
be so rapidly removed, in " exalting
the valleys, and making low eYery
mountain,"-so that highways may be
cast up for the rapid convey&Dce of
men, &Dd the means of blessing them.
How rapidly has education of late
proceededI How has all science been
searched out, &Dd all arts improved,
--and antiquities r&Dsacked, &Dd in-
ventions multiplied. The Lord hath
indeed been hastening his work in
these our times. He bath been put-
ting most liberally into our banda.
He hath also been opening the eyes
of m&Dy here and there, to see won-
drous things out of his law. May
the beauty of his word be indeed
made to appea.r,--and may ita power
be felt; and may, for this, the Spirit
be poured upon us from on high, and
may his people indeed see their posi-
tion--and their privilege,-&Dd be

own, but all as intrusted to their care,
for the good of all, as they have op-
portunity!
I know not of any objection to the
mpposition of this people being Israel,
which has uot ~n anticipated by the
spirit of prophecy, and which may
not be turned to the advantage of
our argument. Thus:-
Had they, like the prodigal son,
wandered into a far country, among
fields of swine? Were they found
eating things that are ceremonially
unclean? Such was foretold of Israel.
It was prophesied that he would eat
unclean thingt, in the land of Assy-
ria. Had they corrupted their reli-
gion, eo as even to become worship-
pers of wood and stone, and of new
gods, which had newly come up?
Such, aleo, was plainly foretold of
Israel Had they lost even the name
of Israel, and were they not known
as being the peculiar people of God?
This also was foretold. The prodigal
&on was not only to be lost to his
father, but even to himself. But the
lost son shall find himself: he hath
already, even when afar off, been
found of hie Father.-lsa.lxiii. 16-

1L.VING previously shown that the
Scriptures lead us to look for the lost
tribes of Israel ip the north-west,-in
Europe; and that the whole scheme of
Providence, especially with regard to
the administration of the word, is cor-
respondent to this expectation: we, in
the Lecturebeforelast,proceeded to see
whether history favours our view; and
we then saw that history, and the tra,.
ditions of the north, do require this
view, in order to clear np what is
othemse inexplicable. Between the
~ and.~ ceD:~es, Europe, in.a
manner, changed its inhabitants. The
new race iBBued from the north-eut,-
from the sa.me quarter as that in which
we saw that Israel had lei\ the most
distinct traces of their sojourn. In our
last Lecture we saw that the Scrip-
ture recognized the facts accompany-
ing this mighty migration of nations;
and the circumstances of Europe then,
and now,-when, if Israel were to see
out of obscurity, and out of darkne88,
they might look for their ancient ene-
mies, and would not find them,-even
all that contended with them ; ao

utterly have they been made a thing
of nought. We then, also, saw that
the whole phenomena of Europe, after
that great change of its inhabitants,
were correspondent to this view of the
ease. When the storm had abated, and
when the·atmosphere had cleared, and
a distinct view could be had of how
matters were settled,- we saw that
every thing, as far as it was looked at,
gave unequivocal indications of its
having been Israel who were given to
poaseBB the land, to the excl118ion of the
Romans and barbarians, both of whom
had sought their destruction, and had
robbed them of the homes they pre-
viously had been given, between the
Don and the Danube, and in the neigh-
bouring districts of the northern wil-
derness.
We now enter still more minutely
into this latter part of our aubject ;
and propoae to take, as a specimen of
the grand family of nations, one nearest
home--theAnglo-Saxon branch. This,
of courae, is not taken to the excll18ion
of the others; but it happens to be the
first that arrested the lecturer's atten-
tlon,--one with regard to which it ia
of the most importance we should be
resolved,--tmd one, to the evidence
for which we have the most easy ac-
cess. It surrounds us on every side,
and, hereafter, one of the mostremark-
able facts connected with this subject
will be, that such multifarious and ob-
trusive evidence should have been so
long disregarded.
We propose taking a view of the
Anglo-Saxons chiefly anterior to their
embrace of Christianity, at a time
when their manners and institutions,
political or religious, were unin.flu-
euced by the Bible, as received through
that medium. If, at that time, their
physical appearance, their mental and
moral character, their conduct in the
private and public relations of life,
their civil institutions, religioua opi-
nions, rites Md ceremonies, and all else
respecting them, be such as might rea-
sonably be expected of Israel;- if
there be no incongruity,but e\'cry cor-
respondencyin the ca.«e: surelywemay
say that the truth has been now ar-
rived at,on this important, and hitherto
moat perplexing point ; and we may
then proceed to see what should be
its practical in.fluence,-which we be-
lieve to be no leBS important. If a
young man had gone astray, (and this
is the lost son,) what else could be
done ? The father knew the marks
of the son, and has ucertained the
direction in which he wandered;-
all these he has clearly poiuted out.
Let us now see to whom they apply,
The people to whom they all apply.
and who are found at the time and in
the place predicted, are, we may rest
assured, the children of the promise ;
the nations that were to come of
Jacob, the very seed of Abraham
according to the flesh, as well as
the greater part of those who 11re aiJo
his children by faith.
We before saw that the Scripture
leaves captive Israel in the north,-
in the cities of the Medes, and in other
places in the northern possessions of
AMyria. Now it is a remarkable fact,
that to this very quarter are the An-
glo-Saxons traced by Sharon Turner,
in his valuable history of this people.
Where Israel was lost, there the Sax-
ons were found. Here are two puzzlea
which have been long enough before
the historians :-Whither went Israel,
the most important people aa to the
promiaes and purposes of Jehovah?
Whence sprung the Saxons, the most
distinguished of all the families of
mankind in the providence of God;
and especially as to the benefits he
hath bestowed upon them, and enabled
them to bestow upon others? Why
should we needlessly create a diffi-
culty, and make the Most High work
contradictively, and produce miracles
without a cause ? Why cut oft' the
people to whom the promises were
made, and whom He said he would not
utterly destroy, although he would
seem to do so? " by cut off this
people, and in the same place raise up
another people; from an origin alto-
gether unknown,-answering in every
re•pect to the character he had been
so long giving to the former race; and
having also, to the most minnte

particulars, the destiny of Israel ful-
filled in them ? Ia thia likely ? Ia
it consistent with the wisdom, and
truth, and faithfulneaa of God ? It ia
not.-It hasnothing, either in or out of
Scripture, to support it; and might at
onoe be rejected. .Yet we proceed:-
Speaking of the second, the Teu-
tonic atock of the European popula-
tion, S.!1!!:9n ~er obeervea,-
"Itispeculiarlyinteresting to us,because,
from ita branches, not only our own iJn..
mediate anceston, hnt al.oo those of the
11101tcelebrated naliona of modem Europe,
have unquestionably descended. The
Auglo..SuODS, Lowland Scotch, Normana,
Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, Germaua,
Dutch, BeJsians, Lombarda, and Franka,
have all sprung from that great fountain of
the human race, which we have distin-
guished by the tennB S~ythian, German or
Gothic. The J1rot appearance of the Scy.
thian tribes in Europe, may be placed,
according to Strabo and Homer, about the
eighth, or, according to Herodotua, in the
eeventh eentury, before the Chrialian era."
-Even the former of these dates, it may
be observed, is the same with that of the
A.asyrian captivity. " The tlrst scenes of
their civil en.tence, and of their progres-
sive power, were in Asia, to the east of
the Aruea; "-the very dlatrict into which
Israel had been brought, by those whose
porpose with regard to them waa so very
dHferent from thia, the purpose of God.
"Here they multiplied, and extended their
territorial limits, for some centuries, un-
known to Europe." The account of
Diodorus is, that " the Scythiana, formerly
inconsiderable and few, possessed a narrow
region on the Arues ; but by degrees,
they became more powerful in numbers
and in COIII"'Ige. They extended their
boundaries on all sides ; till, at last, they
raised their nation to great empire, and
glory." All this is most consistent with
the promise made to the house of Joseph,
whose very name means incre<Ut. "One
of their kingw becoming valiant and skilful
in the art of war, they added to their terri-
tory, the mountainous regions about Cau-
casus; also the plains towards the ocean;
and the Palua M&l<ltis, with the other
regions near the Tanais ;" the very quarter
in which are to be found the Israelitiah
bllrying placeswebefore pointed out. "In
the course of time, they 8ubdued many
nations between the Caspian and Meotia,
and beyoDd the Tanais or Don. In the
G
time of Herodotus, they had pined an
important footing in Europe. They seem
to have spread into it from theTanais to the
Danube; and to have then taken a weat.
erly direction ; but their kindred colonies,
in Thrace, had extended also to the south.
They have become best known to us, in
recent periods, under the name ot Getm,
or Goths, the moat celebrated of their
branches."
With regard to the ~ in par-
ticular, Sharon T.JW!§r observes,-
" They'll!ri!TGerman or Teutonic, that
Ia, a Gothic or Scythian tribe : and ot the
various Scythian naliona which have been
recorded, the Sakai or Sacae are the people
from whom the descent of the Suona may
be interred, with the least violation ot pro-
bability. They were so celebrated, that
the Persians called all the Scythians by
the name ofSacae. They seized Bactriana,
and the 11101tfertile part ot Armenia, which
from them derived the name of Sakasina.
They defeated Cyrus, and they reached
the Cappadoces on the Euaine. That
aome ot the divisions ot tha people were
really called Sakasuna, (from which we
have our word Suon, or Sacson,} is obvi-
ous from Pliny ; for he eays, that the Sakai
who settled in Armenia, were named
Sacassani, which is bnt Sakwuna, speh
by a person who waa unacquainted with
the meaning of the combined warda ; and
the name Sacasena, which they gave to
the part of Armenia they occupied, ia
nearly the aeme sound as SuoniL It is
also important to remark, that Ptolemy
mentions a Scythian people sprung from
the Sakai, by the name ot Suons."
Many opinions have been given aa
to the origin of thia name Saxon: we
may mention one, which has not the
leas probability of truth, from the fact
that every former one haa proved un-
satisfactory. Wesupposeitderivedfrom
Iaaac, by which, we find, from Amos,
thia houae of Israel had begun to deno-
minate itself, just before the captivity.
Itwaansual to contract the commence-
ment of the name, especially when
they combined it with any other word,
or applied it in a familiar manner:
Saxon ia, literally or fully expressed,
the aon of Iaaac. But our argument
stands not in need of etymology.
The Saxons having reached the
western extremity of the European
continent, the Cimbric Cheraoneaua,

now called Jutland, and having spread
out to the three smaller islands, North
Strandt, Busen, and Hel.ig-la.ud, betook
themselves much to a seafaring life;
and gave considerable trouble to their
enemies the Romans, by the skilfulness
and courage of their attacks upon the
western provinces ofthe empire. They
earlymadedescentson Britain; so that,
even while the Romans held poesession
of the island, an officer bad to be ap..
pointed to guard from their attacks
the eastern coast, which began now to
get the name of the Saxon shore.
When what were calledthe Barbarians,
began in earnest to avenge themselves
on Rome, (which certainly bad, upon
the whole, shown but little mercy to
them,) then were the Romans obliged
to contract their empire; to withdraw
their forces from the more remote pro-
vinces, in order to defend those that
were nearer the centre, and more valu-
able. They left the Britons to manage
matters for themselves. These bad,
through disuse, it is said, become in-
capacitated either for counsel or for
war, so that, when left by the Romans,
-who had previously kept all, as it
were, in their own hands,-they felt
themselvesquite unable, single-handed,
to meet the dangers that surrounded
them. The Scots and Picts came
pouring in upon them from the north;
whilst the Saxons renewed their des-
cents upon the eastern coast. The
idea seems to have struck the Britons,
of playing off these enemies the one
against the other, and they were so
far successful. The Saxons came into
the pay of the Britons. Some say
that it was at the earnest request of
the Britons, that the Saxons now
visited South Britain, to defend it
against their brethren of the Pictish
line, who had already come into the
possession of the eastern coast of Scot-
land. However this may be, certain
it is, that they did come, and fight
successfully for the Britons. They
were given the isle of Thanet;-after-
wards they obtained the county of
Kent, and so onward they proceeded,
until the far greater part of the island
came into their possession. The origi-
naJ inhabitants were, by one means
and another, excluded: so that Saxon
laws, religion, and language, were
universally established. These people
bad come over in different bodies, at
different times, and planted a number
of independent kingdoms, generally
called the Heptarchy. These gradu-
ally merged into one kingdom; and,
in the mean time, they adopted the
profession of Christianity. The nation
was fast degenerating into monkish
sloth and superstition, when they were
fearfully aroused by the rude incur-
sions of the Danes; who were of the
same origin with the Saxons, professed
the same religion which the Saxons
professed, at the time of their coming
into Britain;-they also spoke a dialect
of the same language. The Danes bore
sway, for some time, in the island;
and, at length, became one nation with
the Saxons; apparently throwing them
back into partial barbarism, but really
invigorating the English stock; and
the more fitting this people for future
greatness. After a time, the Normans
came next; and produced another re-
volution in England; and another
renewal of the northern blood: the
Normans being a colony of the same
people, who had settled in that part of
France, which was after them called
Normandy. These three great im-
migrations into England, have been all
from the same source. We might take
either the Anglo-Saxons, the Danes, or
the Normans, as the particular subject
of our enquiry; but, independent of
other considerations, the Saxons seem
to claim our principal attention, as
having been the first comers, and the
Angles as having given birth to the
greatest body of the people.
One of the very first things to which
our attention was drawn, in consider-
ing the case of ancient Israel, was
their physical appearance,-their per-
sonal beauty: and this we saw was
recorded, not merely of the mothers
of the race, but specially of Joseph,
whose posterity we seek to identiJY.
The modern Jews, are many of them
very dark complexioned, chiefly per-
haps, as having become so intimately

blended with the children of Ham;
bnt as to ancient larael, much is said
of their fili.rneas. Correspondent to
all this, is the deeoription of the
.Anglo-Saxons, upon their coming into
Britain. They are deacribed as being
"&ir of complexion, cheerful of coun-
tenance, very comely of stature, and
their limbs to their bodies well pro-
portioned." Two most remarkable
events, in the history of this people,
are connected with their beauty: these
are, their first settlement in the coun-
try, and their conversion to Christian-
ity. As to the former, we read that
the kinswoman of Hengist, one of
their first leaders, so won the heart of
the British monaroh, that he delivered
himself over to her counsels; and so
let\ the greatest and most valuable
part of the island to be possessed by
her countrymen; whilst he retired,'and
began to build fur himself in W&lea.
We are also told, that when, after
the settlement in Britain, some of their
youths were exposed as alaves, in the
markets &t Rome, they so attracted
the attention of Gregory, &ft.erWiu:da
Pope, that he stopped to ascertain
what they were, and whence they had
come; and upon being told they were
Angles, he said they were rightly
called angela. "It lltlits them well,"
said he, " they have angel faces, and
ought to be co-heirs of the angels in
heaven." So powerfully did the sight
ofthese youthsimpresshisimagination,
th&t he ceased not until he procured
a mission from Rome, consisting of
Austin and other monks, for the eon-
version of their countrymen. There
are examples, &t that period, ofEngliah
youths being, beca11116 of their beauty,
preserved from execution, even af\er
having been sentenced to death.
It may be gathered from Scripture,
that considerable attention was, among
the Israelites, paid to the dressing the
hair; and among the Anglo-Saxons
and Danes, fine hair was considered
one of the greatest ornaments; and
they were &t no little pains in setting
it off to the best advantage. Now,
fine and well-dressed hair is not
readily found among a rnde people;
G2
it rather indicatesthatthel'8Ctl Jl08Bell8-
ing it, have, like Israel, been very long
under mental training.
One of the very·first things which
struok me in this enquiry, and which
indeed puzzled me exceedingly, before
I knew how to solve the problem, was
the great similarity of the Jewish
head to the English. H, thought I,
these are of two different sons of Noah,
the one of Japhet, and the other of
Shem, how is it th&t they are both
reckoned of the same, the Caucasian,
family, and of the same most improved
branchofthatfamily? Thoeewhohave
looked at the heads of the different
raoes, and diligently compared them;
and seen them to be, in general, so
strongly in contrast to the European
head,-far their superior in beauty
and powe~will readily acknowledge
that this is no minor matter. The
Jewiah and English head, are of the
same general form; and, what is far
from being the ease among the several
branches of the Caucasian family, they
are of the same size,--one of the lar-
gest, the very largest, posae88ing any
pretension to beauty. The head is
high, and has an ample anterior de-
velopment; but is by no means defici-
ent in the domestic propensities behind;
so that it is rather elongated, than
round, and the sides are perpendicular
rather than eloping. The size and
form of the head, serve, much more
aocnrately than complexion, toidentify
a race. Even the difference that does
exist of form, between the English and
the Jewish head, serves to corroborate
our view; correspondent as it is to the
difference of character between the
two familiea of Israel, as pointed out
in Scripture.
One of the principal things in which
Israel was edncated,-and a strict &t-
tention to which was interwoven with
all their private and national concerns,
and which may be expected to distin-
gniah the race,-was JUstice and a re-
gard to truth, as averred in the pre-
eenceofthe heart-searchingGod. Their
laws were not merely put upon public
record ; they were made familiar to
the understandings of the people from
100 M:OJU.L CJUJU.CTBJU8TICI OJ' TIDI: DGLIBJL [LBc. :a.
infancy. And mob wai the case ai
to the ancestors of the English, of
whom it is written, that " their lawa
were severe, and vices not laughed at;
and good onstotnll were of greater au-
thority-with them, than elsewhere were
good laws; no temporizing for favour,
nor usury for gain." It need not be
remarked,with regard to their descend-
ant&, that their probity is remarked,
and depended upon, &11 over the world.
It may not, of QOurse, have, in every
instance, been 110 complete as is desir-
able; but still it is distinguished, and
has greatly conduced to procure them
inlluence both as individuals and as a
nation. It is true, the Jews are repre-
sented as not being 110 strict in their,
observance of truth, as might be ex-
pected from the training they enjoyed.
Supposing the accusation to be cor•
root, something must be &llowed for the
deteriorating circumstances in which,
as an oppressed people, they have long
been placed: whilst their brethren of
the house of Israel, have been rather
enjoying a kind of supremacy over
other people. But even at an early
period, the two houaes were distin-
guished by different names, corre-
spondent to their different character;
the one being c&lled tn!GcAerou. Ju-
dah, aud the other backlltding Israel;
-(See Jer. chap. iii.)
A wayward independent spirit ; a
Btifl'-neckedneas of disposition ; an
abuse of the tendency to exercise rule;
is very much complained of in Scrip-
ture, as belonging to Israel; and the
same self-esteem and firmness are no
leas remarkable among many of their
English descendants. The independ-
ent spirit of the latter, in respect to
government, has been such as to pro-
cure them, from Defoe, more than a
century ago, the following character:
" No government could ever pleue them
long,
Could tie theirhands,or rectifytheir tonsue;
In this to ancient brae! well compared,
Eternal murmUl'll are among them heard."
Thia murmuring, however, seems
In a great measure, to have risen, not
merely from their self-will, but al110
from that prospectiveneas ao culti-
vated in ancient Israel, by the pro-
phet&, and by the whole tendency of
their institutions. These looked for-
ward, at least, as much as backward ;
not merely as serving as a chronicle
or record of the Lord's past kindneae
to them ; but as indicators of the far
greater goodneas he would yet bestow.
Accustomed to occupy their minds
upon future national events, and to
form an opinion of what onght to be,
they have been the more ready tofind
fault with the measures of govern-
ment,-these, of course, not always
correspondingto their individnal anti-
cipations. They may have been the
more induced to take habitually an
interest in national ooncerue, from the
fact of its having been continually im-
preased upon them, that they were
dealt with by Providence, not merely
as individnals, but as a nation :-that
the people were responsible for the
conduct of the rulers, as well as the
rulers for the conduct of the people.
-Their interests were one, and the
oversight mutnal.
Israel, we have said, were ever
taught to look forward : they were
ever in a course of instruction,-&lld
a spirit of change was produced in
them which has continued down,
throughout &11 their wanderings, to
these their remote posterity; in whom
a reatleas spirit of improvement is
most remarkable ; and, of itself, dis-
tingnishea these, the Anglo-Saxon des-
cendant&, and their European brethren
and American children generally, from
&11 other people. The history of their
constitution, their religion, their eci-
enoea,theirart&, theirliterature,-ofall
connectedwith them, is, almost without
exception, au exemplification of this
most important law of their nature.
Every thing is, with them, progressive,
and, at the same time, wonderfully
continuous. All which is most con-
aistent both with their origin, and the
training which, in their fathers, they
received ; and al110, with God's ex-
preased design of malting them the
instructors of the world.
Benevolence,-& hearty interest in
Digitized by Coogle
the welfare of others, of strangers as
well asof kindred, was especially need-
ful for them to poeeess, as oooupying
this important relation to the other
branches of the human family: and
this importantgift was bestowed. They
were taught to look to each other's
good : to contribute systematically
to the relief of the poor. When in de-
votion they looked up to the Most
High, they were taught to look com-
passionately down upon the meanest
around them; and, by libeiality to the
poor and needy, to express their thank-
fulness to God, the Giver of all good.
They were given to see the claims
their kindred had upon them ; and
they were also made to know the
heart of a stranger: and so, with re-
gard to the Anglo-Se.xons, it is said,
that they even received all comers
into their holl81l8, and entertained them
in the best manner their circumstances
would allow. This hospitality was,
doubtless abused, when they became
intermingled with strangers ; and re-
strictions were neceesarily adopted.
The modem English, although not so
extravagant, are still remarkable for
their good will. They are, perhaps, the
most genuinely benevolent people on
the face of the globe. Their own poor
they support systematically ; and the
poor of other oountriee they have fre-
quently assisted in the most liberal
manner. Not seldom have they a good
deal embroiled themselves in the quar-
rels of their neighbours; as taking a
hearty interest in their welfare, and as
deeirousofputtingthemtorights. Their
benevolence has latterly been most de-
lightfully exeroieed, in eameet endea.-
voure to benefit the whole human
race with the riches of divine truth,
which have been so entrusted to their
distribution. They have, at the same
time, beenendeavouriDgto break every
bond, as in the case of the previously
enalaved negroes ; and they havedone
much to oonfer upon the nations the
bleeaings of an enlightened education
and a free oonetitntion. Speakingth1111,
we do not speak of every individual of
the English nation ; but benevolence,
a generous intarest in the welfare of
101
others, is undoubtedly a national cha-
racteristic, no lees than the tendencies
that dispose, and, in some measure,
qua.IUY, for rule. ·
This is the race who have shown
that cultivation of the Reasoning
Power which was socarefully bestowed
upon Israel ; that tendency to look to
causes and effects, which is so .useful,
either as enquiring into the natural
laws for the furtherance of Science,
or as applying knowledge thus ac-
quired, to the producing uaeful inven-
tions, for the improvement of the Arts;
for the lessening the evils, inc~
the comforts, or gratifying the intel-
lectual taste of man; and in no branch
of the human family may we find the
pleasing and the useful, so agreeably
combined. They are well qualified
to be the grand producers of good to
man, as well as its most liberal distri-
butors. It need scarcely be observed,
that the other intellectual qualities
that were more particularly cultivated
in Israel ;-such as the power of mea-
suring distances, or judging of propor-
tions; and also that of dra~ analo-
gies and contrasts, of readily Judging,
and clearly illustrating ;-qualities of
mind so necessary to a people who
were to bear an important relation to
man universally,-that of instructors,
administrators ofthe manifold wisdom
of God : these were, and still are,
eqnally the characteristics of the An-
glo-Saxon race, with those we have
already pointed out. And, asyet, their
natural taste for symmetry, their ex-
treme regard to order, their capacity
for enjoying the Double (Job xi 6.-
ls. !xi. 7.-Zeoh. ix. 1ll,) will receive
abundant gratification from that word
of God, that bread of life, which they
have now, in truth, begun to deal out
to others.
The words which the mDUth of the
Lord hath spoken, are not to be dealt
with as if they were _, words. We
are eamutlg to eeek to enjoy them for
oureelves ; and to deal them out, in
all their richnet111 of meaning, unto
others. " The liberal soul shall be

-Concluaion :-Their Sociallna1itutiona, equally with their Personal Character, witness to
the truth of their laraelitish Origin.
To the representations made iD the
last Lecture, with regard to the natu-
ral benevolence of the Anglo-Saxon
race, it may perhaps be objected, that
iD the early history of both the Saxona
and the Danes, there aeema to have
been manifested considerable ferocity
ofdisposition. This, however, can be
aooounted for without supposing them
to poaae88a predominant propensity to
cruelty. Their very bestfeelings were,
before their coming into Britain, so
turned to evil, aa mainly to conduce
to such description ofconduct. Their
admission iDto the hall of Odin, the
father of slaughter, and god of Bre and
desolation; and all their future hap-
pinellll,-depended, they were taught
to believe, upon the violence of their
own death, and the number of their
enemies they had slain in battle. This
belief inspired them with a contempt
of life,-a fondneBB for a violent death,
and a thirst for blood, which happily.
are unknown in the present times.
Thus that 11880ciation of the warlike
propensities with the higher religious
aentiments,-which was produced in
them when their nation was young,-
when, under the leading of the Lord

of hosts, they went forth to execute
the sentence of extennination upon the
wicked nations of Canaan; and which
was also a.t\erwards manifested in the
wars of David,-that connection of
valour and veneration, still existed,
but in a depraved state, and with un-
happy results, oorrespondent to the
change in their object of worship. We
have also before hinted, that their very
sense of justice m&y, in m&DY in-
stances, have h&d much to do with
their deeds of violence. They h&d
been robbed of their country by the
Romans, and obliged to t&ke refuge
in the inhoepit&ble north, where they
were crowded together without the
poeeibil.ity of m&int&ining their exist-
ence, except as turning b&ck upon the
Roman provinces, and serving them-
selves therefrom, && best they could.
And, in such cases, the pusillanimous
people who supported the proud op-
pressor, might expect to suffer, && well
&& th&t oppressor himself: and, the
habit of committing violence being
&equired, it was easily transferred to
other cases, in which there w&& not
the aame excuse.
Th&t their courage was more that
of principle, than of mere animal fe-
rocity, ia evident from the fact of their
so soon settling down into a st&te of
peace, after their conversion to Chri&-
tianity. They then poured the ener-
gies of their minds into the more
tranquil exercises of religion, with an
enthusiasm equal to that with which
they had devoted themselves to war.
They then attempted conquests of
another kind; and became, m&DY of
them, the most active and efficient
missionaries among other nations, and
especially in the north of Europe. It
seems also to have been at the insti-
gation of one of them, Alouinus, that
Charlemagne est&bliahed so m&DY fa--
cilities for learning and science on the
Continent, and especially in Germany,
-which have produced such a power-
ful influence upon the hnm&n mind
ever since.
The case of the Anglo-Saxons, at
this period of their history, seems to
be conaiderably illuatrated by th&t of
the c-cb,-wbo inhabit the aame
country && that in which we have
suppoeed Israel to have dwelt, in the
early part of their sojourn in the north
country, and from which the Saxons
came;-that is, near the month of the
Don, and along the back of the Black
Sea. These people have got the credit
of being wild and savage:-iUld they
certainly are daugerot111 enemies, and.
they do not well brook oppreuion: so
much ia this their oharaoter, that, even
under the despotism of Ruuia, they
fonn among themselves a kind ofr&-
publio, and have much the aame free
and liberal institutions && the English
have, and which seem to be nataral to
the Saxon race generally, and the
most important of which, we sh&ll see
they Jl088888 in common with ancient
Israel.

This people ~ve been 1111ppoeed to

Clark~ ia clearly of opinion that
their own account of th6IIl88lves,
and that of ancient hiatory, are cor-
rect, which give them rather an
eastern origin. They are a remnant
of the Saxon or Gothic race, let\
in that neighbourhood, whilst the
great body of the people were driven
westward ; and they appear to be
busy leavening the surrounding ap-
parently heterogeneous ~ 1111ch
aa the beautiful Circaasians, on the
one ~d, and the horrible Calmucka,
on the other,-together with Tartars,
Polce, Greeks, and Armenians, along
with some RU88iana and Turka. An
improved race ia being produced from
the whol~ speaking, indeed, the Rus-
sian language, but ~~ the mind
and manners of the Cossack. Now,
what is the Don-Cossack-who has, at
a distance, appeared to us aa only a
wild freebcote~ ; and who certainly
baa not been placed in circumstances
the most favourable to morality?
" The Coosacks," obaervea Clarke, " are
justifted in acting towards the RuMiiUlll aa
they have uniformly done : that is, in with.
drawing aa much aa poesible from all
communion with a race of men, whooe
aasociations might corrupt, bot never ad-
vance, the intere&la of their aociety."' He
.gives his own experience. " The people
of the house in which we had been so
comfortably lodged, positively refused to
accept payment for all the trouble we had
given them. No entreaty could prevail
upon any ol them to allow us further aatis-
Caction, by any remuneration. " Cossacks,"
aaid they," do not sell their hospitality." ••
Dr. Clarke baa the following r&-
marks, in describing an entertainment
given to him by the command~-in­
chief of the Cosaack army:-
" The morning after oar return to Oxai,
we received a message from General
Vauili Petrovich Orlof, commander-in-
chief of the Cossack army, lllaliDg, that he
expected us to dine with him at his coun-
try seat upon the Don. We set out, ac-
companied by our friend Colonel Papof,
and a Greek officer in the Cossack service,
whose name was Mamonol. The general
had sent his carriage, with six fine Cossack
hones, and several COIIII&Cks mounted,
with lances, to escort us. We passed
along the llleppeS, and occaaionally throof!h
vineyards, p1&nted with cucumbers, cab-
bages, Indian wheat, apple, pear, peach,
and plom trees, and melons, for aboot ten
miles, till we arrived at his houoe, which
stood upon the European side of the river,
opposite the town of Tscherchaskoy, and
distant from it about ftve miles. Here we
found elegant and accomplisbed women
assembled round a piano-forte : and after.
wards sat down to aa magrilii.cent a dinner
aa any English gentleman might alford ;
the whole ol which was served upon plate.
The company coaai8led ol about twenty
persona. The general presented ua with
mead thirty years old, which tasted like
fine Madeira. He wished very much for -
Engliah beer, having often drank it in Po.
land. A number of very expensive wines
were brought round, many olthem foreign;
bot the wine of the Don aeemed superior
to any of them. AI. we sat banqueting in
lhia sumptuous manner, I called to mind
the erroneous notiOIIll we had onoe enter-
tained ol the inhabitants of this country,
and which the Rtwians still continue to
propagate concerning the Cooaack territory.
Perhaps few in England, casting their eye.
npon a map of this remote corner of Ea-
rope, have pietured in their imagination a
wealthy and poliahed people, enjoying not
only the refinements, but even the luxuries
ol the moet civilized natioaa. The con-
ve.rsalion had that enlightened and asree.
able cast which characterizes well.educated
military men. Some pe<:uliarities, which
distinguished the manners of our ancestors,
and are still retained in the ceremonial
feasts ol ancient corporate bodies, might be
observed. The practice ol drinking toasts,
and rising to pledge the security of ihe L'Up-
bearer, waa a remarkallle inatance. An-

When we took leave of the general, he
said, if we preferred returning by water,
for the sake of variety, we might use hi8
bazge, which was prepared, and waiting to

found It manned by ten rowers, and de..
eorat.ed in a most costly manner. It was
covered with line ocarlet cloth ; and Per-
sian carpets were spread beneath a canopy
of silk."
"Perhaps an anecdote which I shall
now relate, may render the contrast be-
tween the COM&CkB and the Ruasi&llll more
llriking. The truth of it, on aecount of its
notoriety, will not be disputed by either
party. Whenever a quarrel among the
Cosiat-ks cauaes them to combat each
other, they fight, aa in England, with their
fists, and never with knives, daggers, or
any sharp instrument. This practice is 80
established a characteristic oftheir country,
that it gave rise to a very remarkable
wager. Teploft' and Gelagin, two of the
late empress Catharine'• privY counsellors,
happened to be in her presence, when it
waa told her that a COIII&Ck priest, then a
monk in the Convent of St. Alexander
Nevald, had been amoled for cutting the
throat of a young woman, 11·hom he had
made pregnant, and with whom he had
quarrelled ; upon which Tep!oft' offered to
wager with Gelagin that the monk was not
a Coeaack. The bet was made, and won
by Teploft'; the monk proving to be a
Russian. Being questioned how he could
possibly divine the probable aucceu of hi8
W&ge!'-' Because,' oaid he, ' no COMilck
would atrike a woman ; if he did, he would
nae his hand, and not his knife.' " -
Clarkh Tr01wZ..
The ch&racter of a people may be
very much determined by their man-
ner of treating Woman. The estima-
tion In which she waa held by ancient
Israel, appears to have been remark-
able. We find her eminently influ-
ential both for good and for evil; aa
in the cue of Deborah, among the
judges; and of Jezebel, after the sepa-
ration of the nation into the two king-
doms of IaraeJ. &nd Judah- Among
them were prophetesses &nd witches, ·
as well as true &nd &lee prophets.
The oounsels of woman sometimes
prevailed in the moet important public
105
afFairs, &nd under her guidance the
anna of the nation were occasionally
wielded with the greatest suoeess. It
does not seem that it was until after
the separation of the two kingdoms,
that the women were separated from
the men in the public worship, &nd
were given a court outward from theirs
in the liemple. Even so early, as at
the Red Sea, we find Miriam, the sister
of Aaron, taking a timbrel, &nd lead-
ing forth the women after her, with
timbrels &nd with dances, in the pub-
lic rejoicing, saying,-
" Siug re to the Lord,
For be hath triumphed glorioualy ;
The horae aud hia rider hath He thrown
iuto the aea.•
Afterwardswe find this veryMiriam,
eqnally with Aaron, rivalling even
Moses himself, &nd saying, " Hath the
Lord only spoken by Moses? Hath
he not also spoken by us?" The very
poaaibility of such &n occurrence as
this taking place, argues a state of
equality between the sexes, much
greater than now exists in those ooun-
tries,-snd such as exists in our o'Wn.
The innocent intercourse of the sexes
does not appear to have been at all so
constrained in &ncient Israel, as it is
now In the eaat,-but such as it is
with us in Europe. It may perhaps
be eaid, that the emancipation of wo-
m&n, among ourselves, has been pro-
duced by Christianity. We, of oourae,
cannot me&n to deny this tendenc;y In
Chrietianity; but, here, this tendency
does not seem to have been so much
required: the Anglo-Saxons are thus
~~~ during their early sojourn
m Bntain:-
" The English in thia •od, treated the
fair sex with a degree rauenuon and re-
spect, which could hardly have been ~
pected from a ~e 80 unvolished in their
mannera. This way of thinking they un-
doubtedly derived from their ancestora,
the ancient Germ&Ull ; who not only ad-
mired and loved their women, on account
of their personal charms, but entertained a
!rind of religious veneralion for them, u
the peculiar f'avouritoa of heaven ; and
con.'Allted them as onwles. Agreeable to

t.hia, we find some of the Aogl~
ladies were admitted into their most august
11118e1Dbliee ; and great allenlion paid to
their opinio1111; and so considerable waa
their influence in the most. important
aft'airs, that they were the chief instrument&
of introducing Christianity into almost. all
the kingdoms of the Heptarchy."-Heory'a
Great Britain, Book ii. chap. 7.
To the aame p11I'Jl086 speaks Sharon
Turner, in his history of this people:-
" It is well known that the female sex
were mur.h more highly valued, and more
reopeetfullytreated,bythe barbarousGothic
n&tiooa, than by the more polished states
of the east. Among the Aoglo-Saxooa,
they occupied the same important and in-
dependent rank in society which they now
enjoy. They were allowed to poaaeea, to
inherit, and to transmit landed property ;
they shared in all the social festivities ;
they were present at the witena gemot,
and shire gemot ; they were pennitted to
sue and be sued, in the court.'l of jlllltice ;
their pen!ODS, their safety,their liberty, and
their property, were protected by express
laws ; and they poaaeeaed all that sweet
inlluence which, while the human heart is
re8p0118ive to the touch of love, they wiU
ever retain in those countries which have
the wisdom and the urbanity to treat them
as equal, intelligent, and independent
beings."
-And the Anglo-Saxons, having the
wisdom and urbanity thus to treat the
fair sex, ought not, surely, to be ac-
counted less polished than the most
civilized nations of the east :-from
among whom they had come : but
from none of whom, save their lsrael-
itish ancestors, they conld learn that
trnly just and generous propriety, with
which woman was, throughout their
various changes, treated amoug them.
Notwithstanding this comparative
equality, and, in some respects, supe-
riority, of the fair sex, among the an-
cestors of the English, every woman
was placed under some guardian or
other, without whose consent she conld
not execute any legal deed. Thus
the father was the guardian of his
daughter; the husband of his wife;
and the male heir of the husband was
the guardian of the widow. The king
was the legal guardian of those wo-
men who had no other. When a young
man made his addresses to a lady, one
of the first steps he took, was to se-
cure the consent of her mundbora, or
guardian, by making some present,
suitable to his rank, and that of the
lady. Something similar to this we
find related in the Scriptures, respect-
ing oontracts for marriage among the
Hebrews. In this way was Laban
profited by the disposal, both of his
sister Rebekah, to Isaae,-and of Leah
and Rachel, to Jacob. No marriage
conld be lawfully celebrated without
the presence of the woman's guardian,
who solemnized the marriage by d~
livering the bride to the bridegroom;
by which the latter obtained the
claims of legal guardian over the lady.
From this we still retain the custom
of giving away the bride in m.arriag6.
The custom of the bridegroom's giving
at that time a ring to the bride, seems
also to have had an eastern origin. It
was a token of his endowing her with
his property, and making her mistress
of his house. A seal, we may well
believe, was on the ring in ancient
times; by affixingwhichseal, authority
was given to a deed. Thus we read
that when a king gave his authority,
upon any particular occasion, to a
subject, he did so by giving the king's
seal ; and this was done by putting
his ring, having such seal, upon the
finger of the penon to whom was d~
puted the royal power. The bride-
groom thus, by giving the ring, at
once recognized his natural right to
exercise authority; at the aame time
he invested the woman with the aame,
under, or with, himself. Perhaps the
large square piece of cloth, supported
by a tall man at each oomer, and held
over the bridegroom and bride, in the
after-part of the ceremony, when ~
ceiving the nupQal. benediction, may
also have had the aame eutern origin.
The other mahiage ceremonies,-
such as the bridegroom'& party, in
martial array, going for the bride, un-
der the conduct of the forem06t man,
to conduct the bride in safety to the
house of her future husband ; the
bride's procession in return, led by

the brideewoman, and followed by a
com)J&Ily of young maidens, who were
called the bride's maids; her betrothal,
when carried thus to the house of the
bridegroom; the united ~oicing pro-
cewon thence, to receive the priest's
benediction; the gladsome return; and
the subsequent splendid marriage sup-
per, all forcibly remind us of similar
ceremonies prevailing in Israel, and
intimated throughout both the Old
and New Testaments. The fea.stings
and rejoicings continued, for severa.l
days a.fter the ma.rria.ge, and seldom
ended until all the provisions were
consumed. To indemnify the hus-
band, in some degree, for all these ex-
penses, the relations of both parties
ma.de him some present or other at
their departure. And this, also, we
find, was the case among the Hebrews,
as is intimated in that beautiful nup-
tial song, (Ps. xlv.);--which Psalm ie
beautifully illustrated by the Saxon
ceremonies, to which we have alluded;
as also they a.re illustrated by it.
" Chastity in their youth," we are told
by Henry, " and conjugal fidelity after
marri"'!", may justly be reckoned nalional
virtues of the ~a.xons~Their ancea;.
tore, the ancient Germa.ns, were famous
for both these virtues. The intercourse
between the sexes did not commence till
both arrived at full maturity. The laws of
matrimony were observed with great strict.
ness. Examples of adultery were ex-
tremely rare, and punished with much
severity. The husband of an adulteress,
in the presence of her relaDons, cut otf her
hair, stripped her almost naked, turned her
out of his house, and whipped her from
one end of the village to the other. When
the matrimonial knot was once duly tied,
nothing but the death of one ofthe parties,
or the infidelity of the wife to the marri"'!"
bed, could generally have power to dis-
IKllve it. There were, however, instances
of volunta.ry separations, and even di-
voroea."
All which is correspondent to what
we know of ancient Israel, with re-
gard to whom the utmost ca.re wa.s
taken in these particula.rs. Neither
people were so perfect as could be
wished; but still they were very far
in advance of most other nations.
With regard to Children: As among
the Hebrew women, so among these,
their Saxon daughters, was it a.c-
counted a disgraceful thing, and one
of the greatest misfortunes, to be wi~
out oll'apring. And as it seems to have
been the case with the former, so was
it with the latter; mothen generally
nursed their own children. When
some Saxon la.dies, after the introduc-
tion of Christianity, refused that la-
bour, they were reckoned guilty of an
innovation. The paternal authority
did not extend to the power of life
and death, as among the Gauls; but
parents had a right to correct their
children with becoming severity, to
regulate their conduct, to sell their
daughters to husbands, with their own
consent; and even to sell both sons
and daughters into slavery, to relieve
themselvea from extreme necessity :
all which we expressly know to have
been the case with ancient Israel.
We know that in Israel the ties of
kindred were very fully a.cknowledged,
beyond the mere domestic relations;
and one of the claims of kindredship,
was the avenging of blood. The
friends of the slain ha.d a recognized
right to slay the shedder of blood.
This also was the case with regard to
the Saxons. The custom, it seems,
degenerated into family feuds and
bickerings, and private wars, which
disturbed the public tranquillity, and
prevented the regula.r course of jus-
tice; so that many laws had to be
made on the subject, one of which
provides that the murderer alone shall
be obnoxious to the resentment of the
relationa of him whom he had mur-
dered, and not his whole family, ail
formerly. They ha.d also, like Israel,
pla.ces of refuge where the avenger
could not enter.
The Saxons seem to have been, like
the Israelites, not a giddy isolated
number of individuals. They had a
strong tendency seriously to apply
themselves to the matter in hand, a.nd
closely to combine one with another,
for the furtherance of a common ob-
ject. Yet not this, as being entirely
submissive to a diotator; but rather

as each exereiaing an independent,
although harmonious, will in the mat-
ter. This led them to form free So-
cieties of a variety of kinds, some of
which, snch as those for business in
cities and burghs, still in a manner
e:r:ist; and have been the strongholds
even of national liberty at all times.
They seem to have recognized the
principle, " In the multitude of coun-
sellors there is safety." .At the same
time, they acted with concentration;
-and when they did so, it was gene-
rally with efficiency. They pursned
even their private ends in public bo-
dies: yet not so as to 88Crifice their
individual rights, as either cowardly
following each other, or tamely sub-
mitting to a leader. Even with regard
to the relation of Vassai and Baron,
Robertson obeerves,-
'' It was a fundamenta,l principle of the
feudal system of policy, that no freeman
could be subjected to new laws or taxes,
unless by his own consenL In conse.
quence of this, the vassals of every Baron
were called to his court, in which they
established, by mutual consent, such regu-
lations as they deemed most beneficial
to their small society, and granted their
superiors such supplies of money as were
proportionate to their abilities, or to hi&
wants. The Barons themselves, conform-
ably to the same maxim, were admitted
into the supreme assembly of the nation,
and concurred with the sovereign in enact-
ing laws, or in imposing taxes."
.Among the .A.nglo-Suons, this sys-
tem of self-government appears to
have prevailed as much as was com-
patible with the military attitude in
which they were generally obliged to
hold themselves. The theory of their
constitution seems to have been, that
every ten men, or heads of families,
should choose one from among them,
to act for them in the council of their
little community, consisting of gene-
rally ten such compartments or wards.
Ten of these wards formed a tything
or parish. .And ten of these tythings
formed a hundred, the elders ofwhich,
thus chosen, were supposed to meet
for the management of matters be-
longing to the ten tythinga in gene-
raJ: whilst each tything took charge
of the affairs that especially belonged
to itself. The County, which was
still more extensive, corresponded to
the tribe in Israel. The word C<'tmty
or oomt<J seems to be derived from the
Hebrew word signifying to rise up, to
stand,-tmd refers to the rod or en-
sign of the tribe, to which they con-
gregated themselves, in the larger as-
semblies of the people. The Cossacks
were called, in the earlier part of their
history, Comani,-most likely in re-
gard to their tn'bes or standards : as
also they were anciently called Kha-
zarea, on account of their skill in
archery, for which the English also
were remarkable. The word shire
appears to be from the word Shehir,
signifying a city, and still used in
the country, south of the Caucasian
mountains, in which Israel were placed
by the .Assyrians. .A shire is a dia-
trict of country, connected with a
principal city.
The nation of Israel, we have seen,
were, at an early period of their his-
tory, given proper rules for their as-
sociation, snch as were equally adapted
for a small society, or for a large one.
The people exercised a mutual over-
sight of each other in tens; each ten
had one who represented and acted for
them. The institution is very dia-
tinctly expressed, in Dent. i. 9-18,
and appears clearly enough to account
for the peculiar constitution of the
.A.nglo-Suons, about the origin of
which, philosophers have been so puz-
zled, and snch absnrd notions have
been entertained.

Here the people are enjoined to look
out from among themselves, men qua-
lified for official situations ; and these
are to be brought to the chief go-
vernor, ruling by the grace of God,
and he gives them their authority, and
the rules according to which they are
to act. The people are divided into
thousands, the elders representing
which, came to be denominated the
ihouaands of Israel. The subdivision
of the people thus, and into hundreds
and tens, is exactly that which existed
among the Saxons, from the earliest
period ; and, although the substance
of the thing has been greatly lost, the
tenns hundred and tyt/tiflg, or ten, still
exist with regard to civil divisions of
the people in England.
" In the Saxon times all were decennera,
that is, ranked into several tens, each one
being pledged for othera" good abear-
ance ; and, in case of default, to answer it
before the judge, that ill, of the hundred ;
and, in case of default of appearance,
his nine pledges should have one and
thirty days to bring the delinquent forth
to justice : if this failed, then the chief of
those decenners was to purge himself and
his fellow pledges, both of the guilt of the
fact, and a1ao of being parties to the llight
of the delinquent. If they could not do
this, then were they by their own oatha to
acquit themselves, and come under a bond
to bring the delinquent to justice as soon
u they could ; and in the meantimeto pay
the damage out of the estate of the delin-
quent ; and ifthat were not sullicient, then
out or their own estate. The master of
the family was a )?ledge, or one of the ten,

dalion, arched together both for peace and
war. By the law of Decenners, wherein
justice was the band, their armiea were
gathered, not by the promiscuous ftocking
of people, but by orderly concurrence of
families, kindreda, and decenners,all chooe.
ing their own leaden ; and ao honour,
love, and trust conspired together to leave
no man's life in danger, nor death un:re-
venged.
" It was a beautiful composure, mutu.
ally dependent in every part, from the
crown to the clown, the magietratea being
all choice men, and the king the choicest
of the chosen ; election being the birth of
esteem, and that of merit ; thiJI bred love
and mutual trust, which made them as
comer-stones pointed forward to breek the
wave of danger. Nor was other reward
expected by the great men, but honour and
admiration, which commonly brought a re-
tom of acts of renown. Laslly, it was a
regular frame, in every part squared and
made even, by laws which, in the people,
ruled as kz loqueru ; and in the magis-
trates, as kz inteUigt11o ; all of them be-
ing founded on the wisdom of the Greeks,
and judicials of Moses. Thus the Saxons
became aomewhat like the Jews, distinct
from all other people : their laws, honour-
able for the king, easy for the subject ; and
theirgovernment, above all other, like unto
Christ's kingdom, whose yoke is easy, and
his burden light. But their motion was so
irregular, as God was yleased to reduce
them by another way. -Hulorical an<l

So striking is the resemblanoe be-
tween the ancient Saxon constitution
and that of Israel, that, more than a
hundred years ago, a book was pro-
duced with this title : "An Hi&Wrical

we extract these few following re--

This author thereafter proceeds to
prove, from a vast number of in-
stances, recorded in Scripture, that the
representative system prevailed in an-
cient Israel, as in the Anglo-Saxon
constitution.
To those who have attentively stu-
died the institutionsofMose9, and com-
pared them with the Saxon, there
must appear so striking a similarity,
as will be apt to lead to the conclu-
sion that the Saxon commonwealth
was thus framed, after their becom-
ingacquainted with Christianity. This,
however, does not appear to be the
case. They brought these institutions
with them into England, and left simi-
lar institutions among the people in
the north of Europe, with whom they
had been from time immemorial. Yet,
even granting this, we find Millar
making the following remarks:-
" Acording 1o the emiy policy of the
Anglo-S&xons, each of their villages waa
divided into ten u;anU, or petty districts;
and hence they were called tythittgl or
de=nariu, aa their leader waa denomi-
nated a decan.u or tything..,.an. This re-
gulation appears 1o h&ve been extended
owr aU tlu kingdom~ upon tlu neighbour-
ing continent; and in all probability it
originated from the inftuence of ecclesia&-
tieal institutions.
" AI upon the first establishment of
Christianity, under the Roman dominion,
the form ofchurch government wu in some
respects modelled by the political conatitu-
tion of the empire, so the civil government,
in the modern &t&tes of Europe, wu after.
wards regulated in many particu1ara ac-
cording 1o the ayat.em of eoclesiutieal
policy. When the western provinces of the
Roman empire were conquered by the bar-
barous nations, and erected inlo aeparate
kingdmns, the conquerors, who embraced
the Christian religion, and felt the highest
respect for its teachers, were disposed in
many cases 1o improve their own political
imtitutions, by an imitation of that regu.
larity and subordination which waa ob-
served in the order and discipline of the
church.
" In the dlatribution of penons or of
things, which fell under the regulation of
the Christian clergy, it appears that, in
conformity lo the ~11.'1toms of the Jewish
nation, a decimal arrangement wu more
frequently employed than any other. By
the Mosaic institutions, the people were
placed under rulers of thoU&&Uds, of hun-
dreds, of fifties, and of tens. A Jewieh
synagogue, corresponding lo a modem pa-
rish, appears at a subsequent period lo have
been put under the direction of len elden,
of whom one became the chief ruler of that
ecclesiaatieal division. A tenth part of the
annual produce waa appropriated fur
the support of the Levites ; as the same
proportion of ecclesiaatieal livings wu
claimed by the high-priest. Hence we
find that, in modem Europt, the members
of & cathedral church, as well aa those of
amonaatery,were divided into ten branches,
each of which was put under & direclor,
and the tenth of these person.•, or <kcan.u,
waa intrusted with a superintendence of all

tion of tytlu1, and tlu pnltftlillfll of tlu

Tbiawriter seems to have been pr&-
pared to look upon the Saxons aa
being in a state of bllrbari11111,-and
as if they had been obliged for every
thing to the Roman.a, to whom they
were flllperior in arms,-and to whom
their descendants are certainly not in-
ferior in intellectual power, or moral
dignity. Such writers are greatly
at a loss to account for these Mosaio
institutions, existing in so perfect a
state among a people they reckon so
rude. By this, one of the most skilful
of these writers, the conjecture is here
hazarded, that, without any concert,
and even as separated into their mi-
nuter divisions, all these northern
nations fell into this arrangement and
ooaleaoonce, as copying after the ec-
clesiastical institutions then planted
among them. It happens, however,
rather awkwardly for this theory, that
these institutions were most distinctly
posse&&ed by the Danes, and the Da..
ni&h colonies,-who were among the
latest in receiving Christianity ; and
they rather became fainter, the farther
they dep&rted from their early man-
ners. It was not a very likely thing,
to say the least of it, that these na..
tions required to build up society from
the very base, after acquaintance with
Christianity,-when previously .they
had, by their combined energy and wise
counsels, broken down the strength
and policy of Rome. This they did
not do as individuals, nor even as
small parties merely, but as nations,
as acompanyofnations. Was ith'kely
that these people, acting thus success-
fully in concert, would all at onoe, aa
if with common consent, and yet with-
out any concert, throw away their old
associations into utter forgetfulness,
and adopt what was entirely new :
whilst,with regard to the names of the
days of the week, and even religious
festivals, asin thecaseofEaster,-and,
farther, as to the namea of the Su-
preme Being, they retained those they
had used previous to their knowledge
of Christianity? We can readily be-
lieve that, had the author of this
" Hiltorieal View of the English Go-
vernment" been acquainted with our
view of the case, he would not have
been so puzzled in accounting for the
planting of the institutions of Moees
in the north :-he would not havebeen
under the necessity of supposing flllch
a simultaneous growth of like politi-
cal constitutions, the most perfect in
theory, among manyindependent, and
as he supposed, bllrbarous nations ; a
thing of which we have no experience
in the history of the world.
The same writer, it may beobserved,
has been led to acknowledge what is
grossly inconsistent with his own view
of the case, and which, indeed, de-
prives it of its only seeming founds..
tion ; which is, that it was in modem
Europe that the eccleaiaatieal constitu-
tion and arrangements were assimi-
lated to the Hebrew ; so that this
eccleaiaatical change, (equally favour-
able to our view,) requires to be
accounted for, as much as the other.
Even granting, however, that the
Mosaic institutions did exist among
these nations, anterior to their embrsce
of Christianity, may it not still be
objected, that they were given them by
some legislator, who had, somehow,
been made acquainted with the writ-
ings of Moses ? Neither will this ob-
jection stand good. What is imposed
upon a people as foreign to their former
habits, exists only, as it were, in law.
It is long before it becomes familiar to
the every-day habits of the people,
and acquires a perpetuityindependent
of the statute-bock, so as to endure
throughout all migrations and changes
whatsoever, of the people. What is
naturally everywhere part of a people's
political existence, and distinguishes
them continuously through all their
known history, from all other nations,
may well be supposed to have been
·taught them in their infancy, and to
have grown with their growth. It has
been early put into the very nature
of the people. But we know of no
people to whom this was done, except
to Israel. The presumption is, cer-
tainly, altogether in our favour.-We
find the English, in their earliest poll-

tical history, with these institutions ;
and it remains to be proved how other-
wise they received them. The theories
hitherto formed to aooount for them,
have no foundation in history, and are
too fanciful to be admitted as philo-
sophy.
Our argument for the priority of
the Mosaic institutions among the
English,-and their being independent
of the ecclesiastical institutions,-will
still more appear, when we consider
that, in the people's courts, they fol-
lowed their own customs and laws, the
body of which was called the Com-
mon Law; and which had been handed
down to them from time immemorial:
whereas, in the ecclesiastical courts,
that were now, for the firat time in
Europe, allowed the Christian priest-
hood, after the lsraelitish pattern, (in
which the Levites had so much to do
in the administration ofjustice,) there
was no such favour shown to the com-
mon law; but rather, of course, to their
own canon law, and also to the Roman
civil law. The Common Law,--a body
of law, written in the very habits of
the people, and not merely in writing,
but so engraved, as in the rock for
ever, as to subsist, together with this
people, throughout all their migrations,
revolutions, and changes, even of reli-
gion, is a perpetual witness to their
having been, in the earliest period of
their history, under strict moral train-
ing, and accustomed to the careful and
regular administration of justice; such
as could not accidentally have been
given to a nation, far less to a body of
nations : but such as we certainly
know was given to Israel.
Nor was the manner of preserving
the national records so imperfect as
Millar has rashly asserted, thus show-
ing that he was less acquainted with
this people, than with their enemies,
the Romans. Before their conversion
to Christianity, their priests, in dif-
ferent parts of the country, kept, it is
most likely, distinct records, in each
section, aooording to their several
knowledge of what was passing, of a
public and interesting nature. .A.t the
[LBc. L
death of the king, these different ac-
counts were brought together, and con-
solidated into one general history of
the nation during the period. After
their conversion to Christianity, this
business fell into the hands of the
monks, of the Benedictine order, in
whose several monasteries the district
records were kept; and afterwards the
whole were reduced intoone statement
by a chapter of the order. So regu-
larly was every thing of importance
noted in this way, that, it is said, no
history of the same period is so com-
plete as that of the Saxona, from their
arrival in Britain, until the Norman
invasion. In the books of the Kings
of Israel, and the Chronicles of the
kingdom of Judah,-written after the
sa:me plan, according to the lives of the
kings ; and taking a religious view of
men and events, noting particularly
the hand of Providence in national
affa.ira,-we have the origin of all this.
.A.s the learned Mr. Ingram has ob-
served,-
" The Saxon Chronicle may be philo.
eophically considered the l<lCODd great
phenomenon in lhe history of mankind.
For if we except lhe sacred annals of lhe

ram& of a people, described in rapid sue.

guage."
The Scythians, among whom were
the Gotha and Saxons, are as clearly
diatingniahed (Col. iii. 11) from the
barbarians, as are the Jews from the
Greeks; yet historians, at the expense
of many inconsistencies, have been in
the habit of confounding them. We
shall close this line of argument with
a quotation from Turner, who, having
very gratuitously assumed that the
Saxons were barbarians, proceeds to
give a statement of the results of their
settlement in Europe, such as fully
justifies his 8U8picion, elsewhere ex-
pressed, that the Saxons were not 10

barbarou aa baa been mppoeed ; but
were rather deacended from eome of
the more civilized portions of the Asi-
atic population.
" Yet from IUCh aneeaiOra a nation has,
in the ooune of twelve centmiea, been
formed, which, inferior to none in every
moral and int.ellectual merit, is superior to
every other in the love and poeoesaion of
useful liberty: a nation which cullivatea
with equal succesa the elegancies of art,
the ingeniooa labours of induatry, the en-
ergiesof war, the researchesof science, and
the richest productions of geniua. This
improved state baa been slowly attained
under the discipline of very diverai1ied
events.
" The barbaric eatabliahmenl!l were a
new order of things in Europe, but cannot
have been 80 proliftc of misery to mankind
aa we have hitherto, too gratuitously, aa-
IWDed :-when, notwithstanding the dis.
COII1'8f!t!lllent of new languages and insti-
tutions, and ruder habita, they were
preferred by many of the Roiii8DII to the
country which was their binh-place, which
had been 80 long conaecrated by d6!1el'Ved
fame, and whose feelings, mind, and social
manners, were congenial to their own.
" The invasioos of the German nations
dealroyed the ancient governments, and

Empire, in the provinoes in which they
eslabliahed themselves; and ~

with many new teneta and practices. A
new literature and manners, all productive
of great improvementa, in every part m.
perseded the old, and ga•e to Europe anew
!'ace, and to every class of society a new
life and spirit. In the Anglo.Saxon aeule-
menl!l in Britain, all these etrecta were
displayed, with the moot beneficial conae-
quencee."
Limited monarchy, oonatitutional
law, and representative government,
and efficient civil police, and trial by
jury, are among the most important
legacies left the English nation by their
Anglo-Saxon forefathers ; and these
may eJl be easily traced to an lsrael-
itish origin. And to this origin they
have been traced, aa we have seen,
even by those who were obliged, in
rather an unphiloeophical way, to ac-
count for the connection. It is, in-
deed, rather remarkable, that so many
of these institutions should have been
e.llowed to remain aa inoontestable
evidence that this people had been
Moses' disciples. Equally does their
social oondition witness to this, as, in
our last lecture, we saw that their
personal appearance and charactergive
evidence, full and explicit, to their be-
ing the children of Abraham.

of his third book:-
" The revolution C&WJed by the con-
quest of the Angi!>Suona, introduced a
new face of thinga in Great Britain. The
counlly, formerly inhabited b;y the Bri-
tons, was now posaeosed b;y otrangen.
The very names of the towns and pro.
vincea were changed ; and the country was
divided in a very different ~~~&~~ner from
what it was by the Romans.
" The SMOns, Angles, and Jutes, who
are all 10 be considered as one people, and
comprehended under the name of Eng-
lish, had conquered all the aouthern part
of the ialand, from the Channel to the wall
of Severua, and a lillle beyond, IOWarda
.the east. This part of Great Britain, p<»-
oessed by these three nations, was divided
into seven kingdoms, whereof the Saxons
and Jutes had four, namely, Kent, EllSeX,
SU88eX, and Wessex; the Angles alone had
two, Mercia and East.-Aoglia; but in
Northumberland were mixed with the d&-
ecendanta of the SIWins that first took
posaeaoion of the oountr;y beyond the Ham-
her, under Octa and Ebusa."'
"By the Heptaccby;, meant the govern-
ment of the seven kingdOJDS of the Angl<>-
SMODS, considered as making but one
body and one state. The Angi!>Saxona,
as I oaid befure, eotabliahed in Eng-
land a form of government not nnlike
what they had lived under in Germany ;
that is, considering theJDSelves as brethren
and oountr;ymen, and being equally con-
cerned to IIUJlPOlt themaelves in their con-
queots, they conceived it necessary to &&-
list one another, and act in common for
the good of all. To that end, they judged
it proper to appoint a General-in-clrief, or,
if you please, a Monarch, invested with
certain prerogatives, the natore and nam-
ber of which we are not fully informed of.
Upon the death of~ general or monarch,
another was chosen by the unanimous con-
oent of the seven kingdoms ; but there
were sometimes pretty long interregnUIDII
canoed by thewars or divisions between the
·sovereigns who could not meet or agree
npon a choice. .
" Besides this monarcb they had also, as
the centre of the heptarchal government,
an assembly-general, con.,;sting of the
principal members of the seven kingdoms,
or their deputies. Thio is what is called
the WiUenagemot, or general parliament,

after whom the whole 110uthem por-
tion of it came ultimately to be termed
England. It would, however, be an
error to IIUPJIOIMl that only the aouth
part of England was peopled by
them. Partly by direct emigration,
and partly by the 110attering occa-
sioned by the incnraions of the Danee,
and the Norman conquest, the same
race that peopled,first,the centralparte
of the island, called, in the times of
the Beptarohy, EutAnglia,and )fer-
cia, and Northumberland: the liiiiiiii
race was spread ont aouthward into
the Suon quarters,and even weetward
into Walee, u well as northward into
Scotland. And thus the whole body
ofthe people that remained, after their
first settlement here, had the !idvan-
tage of being leavened by a race,
which, with all ita faults, is superior
both as to intellectual capac~y, and
moral power.
This is shown by the eminence to
which those parts of England have at,..
tained, that were the first, and the most
entirely, peopled by the Angles. In
their quarters are found the principal

u distinguished from the Saxon, king-
doms of the Heptarohy. Nor is it to
be overlooked that the capital itself is
from these quarters still supplied with
some main portions of its population
that have carried literature, science,
and art, to 8UCh perfection: and even
mercantile and missionary enterprise
to the bounds of the habitable globe.
With regard to the settlement of the
Angles in Britain, Rapin thus writes,
in his first book, page 38:-
" About this time (A. D. 627) multitudes
of Angles, under the conduct of twlve
clti41, all of equal authority, but whose
names, except Utfa (of whom I shall have
occaoion to speak hereafter), are unknown,
landed a& oome port on the eaatern coast of
Britain, where, without much difficulty
they poosesoed themselves of some post,
those parts being ill guarded by the Bri-
tons. In time, as they were continually
enlarging their conquem towards the west,
they compelled the Britons at length to
abandon the country along the eastern
ehore. The Angles, thoa situated, had an
opportunity of sending from time to time
for fr& colonies from Germany, with
which they founded a fifth kingdom, by the
name of the kingdom of East Anglia, or
of the East Angles. But as their finlt
chiefs assumed not the title of king, the
beginning of this kingdom is generally
brought down to the year 671."
AJJ to the kingdoms of the Hep-
tarchy founded by them, he gives the
following testimony in his third book,
page 55:-
" The kingdom of the East Angles was
bounded on the north by the Humber and
the German Ocean : on the east by the
same ooean, which 8UfrOQJided it almoston
two sides : on the oouth, by the kingdom
of Essex : and on the west, by Mercia.
Its greatest length was eighty, and its
greatest breadth fifty-five miles. It con-
tained the two counties of Norfolk and Suf-
folk, with part of Cambridgeshire. The
chief towns were Norwich, 'thetford, Ely,
and Cambridge. I have already related
how this kingdom was founded by the
Angles that landed on the eastern roasts of
Britain, under twelve chiefs, the survivor
of whom, Utfa, assnmed the title of king
of the East Angles."
And in page 68 :-" The kingdom of
Mercia was bounded on the north by the
Humber, by which it was separated from
Northumberland ; on the west, by the Se.
vern, beyond which were the Britons or
Welsh ; on the south, by the Thames, by
which it was parted from the kingdoms of
Kent, Soasex, and Wessex ; on the east,
by the kingdoms oC E1!8eX and East An-
gila. Thus Mercia was guarded on three
sides by three large rivers that ran into
the sea, and served for boundary to all
the other kingdoms. Hence the name
Mercia, from the Saxon word, Mere, sig-
nifying a bound, and not, as 110me fancy,
from an imaginary river called Mercia.
The inhabitants of this kingdom are I!Ome-
times termed by historians Mediterranei
Angli, or the Mid-land English, and some-
times South Humbrians, as being 110uth of
the Humber; but the most common name
ill that of Mercians. The principal cities
of Mercia were Lincoln, Nottingham, War-
wick, Leicester, Coventry, Lichfield, Nor-
thampton, Worcester, Gloucester, Derby,
Chester,Shrewsbury,Statford,Oxford, Bris-
tol. Of all the kingdoms of the He.ptar-
chy, this was the finest and most ooil8lder-
able. Its greatest length was a hundred
and sixty miles, and its greatest breadth
about one hundred."
And in page 47 :-" The kingdom of
Northumberland was situated on the north
of the Humber. as its name imports. It
was bounded on the south, and parted from
Mercia by that river; on the west, by the
Irish sea ; on the north, by the country of
the Picts and Scots ; and on the east, by
the German Ocean. It contained the p1'1>-
sent counties of Lancashire, Cumberland,
Westmoreland,Northumberland, York, and
Durham. The p:!ll:t'al cities were York,
Dunelm (since Durham), Carlisle
(named by the Romans Luguballia), Hex-
ham, or Hagulstsdt, Lancaster, and some
others of lees note. This country was di-
vided into two parts, Deira and Bernicia,
each, for 110me time, a distinct kingdom
of itself. Bcrnicia was partly situated on
the north of Severus's Wall, and ended in
a point at the mouth of the Tweed. Deira
· contained the I!Outhem part of Northum-
berland, as far as the Humber. The
grea&est length of the whole lringdom, in-
clading both parts, was a hundred and

I oixty miles, and ita greateat breadth one
hundred."
These three kingdoms were those
that were most made a prey of by the
Danes: by the incursions of whom the
Angles appear to have been much
driven out into other portions of the
Heptarchy, and as well into Scotland
and Wales. Thus, in the reign of
Ethelred it is said of the Danes,
" They began with attacking NorthtUD-
berland, of whie.h they at length became
masters. They proceeded next to East.An-
glia, which they also subdued ; and, after
extorting money from the Merci8111, they
en1ered Wessex."
And thus, in speaking of the lan-
gnage of the Anglo-S&xons, Rapin
writes, page 162:-
" To say in general, the Anglo-Saxona
spoke English or Saxon, would not be
showing with sufficient exactness what
their language was. To give a fuller idea
of it, it will be necessary to distinguish
the several tongoes lllled in England after
the arrival of the first Saxona. The Eng.
liah tongue originally differed but little
from the Danish, since the Q.Dcient writers
call them indifferently Cimbric, Scandi-
navian, Gothic ; but this language was not
the same with the Saxon. In the parts
lying north of the Thames was spoken
pure English or Danish, and south of the
Thames pure Saxon. Though these two
languages were different,they so far agreed,
however, as to be undent.ood by both na..
tions. In process of time, and especially
after the union of the seven kingdoms,
Saxon prevailed in all England, because
the kings were of that nation. Thus pure
English (or the language of the Angle.•),
was by degrees disused, or at le.ast ba.
Dished from common conversation. After-
warda the Danes, settling in England,
brought their language, which was not the
ancient Danish or English above men-
tioned, but a modern Danish mixt with the
language of several neighbouring nationa
of Denmark. This modern Danish was
chie11y used in Northumberland, Mercia,
and East Anglia, where the Danes were
masters. Though out of compliance to
the English, Canute the Great published
his laws in Saxon, yet the Danish tongue
was still retained in the north, where the
people were mostly Danes. As it was also
the court language during the reigns of
Canute the Great and his two sons, it
became necessary for the West Saxona,
who adopted aeveral words and idioms of
it into their own language. But upon
Edward the Confeoaor·a accession to the
throne, Suon prevailed again at court.
Hence the inhabitants of the north were
under some Deee18ity of learning it, just
as the Gaacona in France are obliged to
learn French."
As to the origin of the Anglo-Saxon
institutions, Rapin writes thus, pages
147, 148:-
" Great Britain was so overrun with
Saxons, Angles, and Jutes, that hardly
could any remains of the ancient Britona
be discovered. It was very natoral for
these conquerors to establish in their new
erected kingdoms their own country ens.
toms. And therefore it may be advanced
for certain, that the laws now in force,
throughout the greatest part of Europe, are
derived from the laws these ancient con-
querors brought with them from the north.
This might be easily proved with respect
to all the countries concerned in this great
revolution. But at present I ahaJJ confine
myself to England alone. By what I am
going to say, whoever has any knowledge
of the English constitution, will easily be
convinced that the customs now practised
in that kingdom, are, for the most part, the
same_
the Anglo.Saxons brought with them
from the northern countries, and lastly
from Germany.
" An English historian, by comparing
the laws and customs of the Germans
with those of the English, has plainly
shown, the English introduced into Great
Britain the same laws that were in
use in their own country. Nay, he af.
firma, that till the Norman conquest there
was not so much as one law in England
but what, in the main, the Germans had
the same. 'Tis true, u the Anglo.Saxons
consisted of three several nalions, who
had also their separate quarters in Eng-
land, there might be some difference upon
that account between the seven kingdoms
of the Heptarchy. But this difference could
not be very great, since the three nations
were tmited in Germany before their com-
ing into England, and made but one and
the same people under the general name
of Saxons. All that can be inferred from
hence is, that the laws established by the
Anglo-Saxona in England were composed

" The S..U.. had no kiDp in Ger-

the aaaiatance of the Britona onder the
conduot of Hengist. Their territories were
divided into l""lve p1'otntiCIII, over each
of which ahead or governorwas appointed
by the aaaembly-general of the nation,
wherein the supreme power was lodged.
Thia aaoembly was called Wittena..Gemot,
that ia to say, the assembly of the wiae
men, and ailo lhe Mycel Synod, that ia,
the great aaoembly. Besides the governors
of the provinces, there were others ailo set
over the cities and boroughs.
" Though the title of king waa not in
uee among the Suona, it waa, however,
auwned by Hengilt as 110011 as be was
in poaaeuion of Kent. Indeed it W011id
have been difficul1 for him to have found
any other 10 proper to express hia 10-
vereignty over that provinoe. It ia true,
lhe titles of duke and earl, or their equi-
valema, Heretogh and Ealdorman, were
DOt then unknown ; bm they were not yet
tiaed to aignify oovereigns. It was not
till long after that certain dukes and earla
being investedwith sovereign power, these
titles were made use of to denote the su-
preme amhority. TheotherSaxon leaders
who settled in Great Britain after Hengiat,
followed hia eumple in 8I8Ullling lhe title
of king. Th,., whereaa in Germany the
Saxon territories were divided into lwlw

were parted into sevenkingdoms ; bm with
thia diJference, that in Germany each go.
vemor depended on lhe aaaembly-general
of lhe nation, whereaa in England each
king was BOVereign in hia petty kingdom.
However, thia did not exempt him from
all dependence on lhe Wittena..Gemot of
hil own atate, which, in COI\iunction with
him, regulated all impo;tant&ftaira. More-
over, by mutual conaent there was esta..
bliahed a general auembly of the whole

~hiles into lrJ1binga, lalha, or wapenl.aites ;

oomething entirely new to the English.
He only settled the bounds of the former
divisions,making oome alteraliona u eon-
veoience aake. At least, as to the divi-
sion of the kingdom into shires, it ia cer-
tain he only proportioned it in a better
manner than before. Thia ia evident
from there being earls of Somenietsbire
and Devonahire in the reign of Ethel-
wulph, as Asser relates, who Hved about
that time ; but A1ft-ed uniting all England
into one monarchy, made a more exact
and extensive division of hia dominions.
The shires contained a whole province
1111bjeet to the juriadictioo of an earl or
count, and were, therefore, called coauties.
Some of these ~hiles being divided into
trytbiogs, others into laths, and others into
wapentair;es, each ofthese divisions, which
were the same thing onder di1ferentnames,
conaisted of three or four hundreds of fa..
milies, and each hundred was subdivided
into tyt.hings. The courts of ju.otice were

From the testimony of a French
writer, Rapin, it has now been shown
that Britain changed its population,
and, of course, its inatitutiona and
language, upon the settlement here of
the Su.ons, Angles, and Jlltes ; •ho
fonned themselves into a eonetitu-
tional government, called the Heptar-
chy, somewhat analogous to that of
their twelve provinces on the Conti-
nent, andlike that of the twelve tribes
of Iaraal. The moat central position
wu occupied by the Angles; who nl-
mnataly gave Uieir name to the whole,
u &lao they have left the l4ut trace
of their settlement on the Continent:
correapondent to the idea that the
Angles had mainly transported them-
selves to Britain, to the greater part
of which they gave name, whilst they
lost all name on the Continent. I have
noticed the distinguished character of
those parte of England mainly settled
by them, and the urgent occasion of
their spread into other parts, from this
central position in the iala.nd, into
which they were first introdnced un-
dv twelve chiefs.
They were, like Joseph, greatly af-
flicted in the commencement of their

mises were fulfilled in them: but their
Father recognized them 88 being Am-
mi,-my people. And, amidst all their
failings, he recognized in them that
integrityand trustworthiness forwhich
they are so distinguished among the
nations;-that which our Lord calls
"an honest and good heart," in which
hia word might with advantage be

manner in which they withstood, 88 it
were, the world, at the oommenoe-
ment of this century: and in which
they have been enriching it with their
wise institutions and U8eful inventions
more and more ever since, is most
worthy of note; and all this they are
not t.o ason'be t.o chance, but t.o the
goodness of the God of their fathers,
who had promised so t.o defend them,
and so t.o cause tliem t.o be for blellll-
ing unto all the natioDII of the earth.
In their C888 are manifested not the
supposed freaks of blind fortune, but
the good providence of the God of Is-
rael.
That this people have been dealt
wondrously with, is acknowledged by
those who have had the best oppor-
tunity ofjudging; by those who have
studied their history, in oomparison
with that ofother nations. The Abbe
Milot, Royal Professor of History in
the university of Parma; a French-
man, and member of the Church of
Rome, and who had previously writ-
ten a work on the History of France,
wrote also " Elements of the History
of England," from the preface to
which I shall now quote. It is to be
[LBc. XI.
premised, that this anthor wrote pre-
viously t.o the glory of the Georgian
era, since which hath been the great-
est bursting forth of power from this
people on all hands. The Abbe un-
wittingly shows that in them the pro-
phecy h88 been fulfilled, that they
shouldbe "a people tem"ble from their
beginning(' and we ourselves have
eeen that this h88 been "hitherto."
He thus proceeds:-
"No modern history, it m\1.11. beconfessed,
presents to our view so great a number of
atriking pictures u that of England. We
see here a people, Cree, warlike, uncon-
querable, and a longtimeferocious, preserve
the same characteriatic qoa!ities through a
oucoeaoive lrain of bloody ~evolutiool.

Europe, though embroiled withthe Church.
They groaned afterwardo underthe tyranny
of king John ; and this very tyranny pro-
cured them ~ Great Charter, the eternal
basis of their freedom. The English then
gave their crown to France, drove out the
French prince theyhad called to the throne,
and became the terror of the monarchy of
Clovis, which aoomed on the point ofsub-
mitting to the yoke. But France, at length,
after an interval of calamity and madness,
diaplayed its resources, recovered its ancient
glory, inseparable from the cause of its
kingo ; mumphed over a haughty enemy,
whose victories were the Croit of our fatal
disoensiona ; and to revenge itself,had only
occaoion to leave it a prey to disoensions
ati1l more cruel. Two rival, yet kindred,
ho~~~~es, impelled to &1'11111 by rase and
ambition, onatched from each other's brows
a diadem drenched in blood ; princeo
assassinated princeo ; the people masaacred
each other for the choice of a master, and
England now became a theatre of anarchy
and carnage. Under the Tudors we see
tranqoillity reotored, and the national
strength augmented ; but Uberty deatroyed.
A prince, violentand capricious, habituates

"Since the publication ofRymer'a collec-
tion,oeveral able writers baveavailed them-
aelves of the inestimable materials which
that work supplies. Among these, Rapin
de Thoyraa, a French author, waa the first
who diatinguiahed himaelt In lhia care£r.
Ao an hiatorian, judicioua, euct, methodi-
cal, he exhauats hia oubject, he descends to
the minutest particulara ; but. growing
tedioua by being too di1fuae, he aoon o\·er-
burdens the imagination, at the expense of
what he ought to engrave on the memory.
A more eaaential reproach which he de-
aerves, is that. or betraying a prejudice
against hia own country (which by the
severities oC Lewis the Fourteenth bad in-
ourred the resentment of the Proteataub<)
and of favouring the II8Ct or the Purilllns,
those dangerop enthuaia.ts, the ayat.em of
whooe reHgi011 tendo only to render mm
aavage ; and their system of ind~dence
to make them factious and rcbellioua."
The folly of theae latter remarks
of the Abbe baa been abundantly
proved, by the oontran of the case
of England to that of the French Re-
volution.

Rapin, the other French writer,
fi:om whom I chiefly quote in this
Lecture, ill here admitted to be an un-
exceptionable witneaa, except u to two
particulars : the firet is, that Rapin ill
too minute, which ill an ucellent
fault in auoh an inquiry u that in
which we are engaged : where the
minuteneaa of truth, rather than the
generalities of philo110phy, or the em-
bellishment of poetry, ill required.
The second fault here noted against
him ill hill favour for Puritanism,
which the Abbe insinuates has a ten-
dency to render men savage; whereas,
unfortunately for the Abbe's politic
theory on the mqject, it has always
led to the best advantages of civiliza-
tion; and to the fullest development
ofthe powers of man, and of thoee of
the inferior creation under hill IW&Y.
The portion of English history which
has more particularly come under our
notice, ill not, however, very liable to
the Jut objection of the Abbe, u it
belongs to a period long anterior to
the Reformation, and when the con-
troversies connected therewith had
not arisen, to give that vigorous exer-
cise to the human mind, which has
resulted in thoee splendid achiev&-
menta in science and in art, that have
since distinguished Europe.
Thoee who deny that Protestantism
and ftoeedom of diecl1811ion, u con-
nected therewith, have a tendency to
invigorate and elevate the human
mind, have, it may be observed, the
greater need of onr theory, to account
fW the manifest mperiority of the
(LBo, XL
Prote$ant nations over thoee that
have retained all the pretended ad-
vantages of the Papacy: which itself
might have perished fi:om the earth
had it not been for the vigorous inter-
ference of England, whereby their

the King of France. How ill it that
England has been enabledto take moh
a lead among the nations, and to b&-
come mch an emulated example of
literary, commercial, manufacturing,
political, and even military aucceas-
mch an admired type of free inatitu-
tione-if there be not aomething either

them the favour ofHim who hath said

Before the great promised outpour-
ing of the Spirit in the latter day, and
of which outpouring the former rain,
in the days of the apoatlea, was an
umred pledge, it wu predicted that
the Lord would be known u having

TBB VflrY dreea ~ the Anglo-Su:ons
witneeaed to the troth of their Israel-
itiah origin. Their garments are eaid
to have been loose IIDd flowing, and
chiefly made of linen, and adorned
with broad borden. It had been com-
manded of God,thatthe border around
their garments should be of blue; bui
from the Btriotnesa of this rule they
had perhaps departed,- it is eaid;
they were now woven or embroidered
with ta'iow oolOIU'L With regard to
the women, much the aame variety
and eleganoe of dresa appear to have
prevailed, 88 among their mothers in
ancient larael. They had, alao, the
- son of muftling ; wearing upon
the head, a hood or veil,- which,
falling down before, W88 wrapped
round the neck and breast. And, 88
identil)ing theae Anglo-Su:ons with
the people who built the tombe near
the Euine, to which we before re-
ferred, and in one ~ which the large
golden bracelet W88 f'oond; it may be
noticed, that, among them, the men of
consequence orwealth 118UIIllyhad ex-
pensive bracelets on their arms,88 well
as rinp on their flngen. In an An-
glo-Saxon will, the testator bequeaths
to his lord, a beah, or bracelet, of ,
eighty golden mancuaa.
Even before they posaesaed the land
which is bleeeed, " for the deep that
ooucheth beneath,n the Saxona gave
very clear indications of being des-

tined to the empire of the aea. Thus
they are desoribed by an author of the
fifth century:-
" This enemy ia fiercer than any other ;
if you be unguarded, they allack ; if pre-
pared, they elude you. They despise the
opposing, and ~y the UDWlllY; if they
ponme, they overtake ; if they fty, they
escape. Sliipwrecka discipline them, not
deter ; they do not merely know, they are
familiar with all the dawgera of the sea ;
in the midal of waves and thre&lening
rocks they ~oice at their peril, because
they hope to surprise.'"
It may be worthy of remark, thst
the ancestors of the English were ge-
nerally in the habit of forming their
battle lines in the form of a hollow
wedge, something like the Greek let-
ter .b., the point of which, towards the
enemy, is very sharp; and the sides of
which gradually diverge, by whioh it
becomes broadest at the rear. It is
curious enough to observe, that not
only was this the figure of their por-
tion of Britain; but it was, also, muoh
the fo~ of their settlement, as hold-
ding inilitary possession of the land
of Canaan,-from the time of Joshua
to the breaking up of their kingdom.
The tribes along the border of the
Great Sea, formed the base ; whilst
part of the tribeships of Simeon, Ju-
dah, and Reuben, formed the right
side ; and Asher, M&llll8seh, and Gad,
the left. The main angle pointed east-
ward. Among the Anglo-Saxons,
when an army was composed of seve-
ral distinct battalions, or the troops of
several different countries, they often
formed u many of these hollow
wedges u there were battalions. Each
of these battalions being formed of the
inhabitants of the same country, were
expected to fight the more bravely for
the honour of their country, and in de-
fence of their relati0n1 and friends.
This farther supports our idea, that
the counties were so named, from the
circumstance of their each containing
what belonged .to a dietinct standard.
.As was the case with Israel ; the dif-
ferent tribes or battalions, had their
different etandards, with aoitable em-
blems. And u the Israelites were em-
boldened by the preeence among them
of the ark, so did the Saxon army
carry before them the ensigns of their
gods. When they were converted to
Christianity, auoh aa it then was, the
heathen relics gave way to the relics
of the l&ints, or some other represen-
tation of their new religion ; as, also,
did the blessing of their arms by the
heathen high priest, to the benedic-
tion of the Christian biahop. They
used th~ arms with akilfulneBB, 1111
well aa with force ; and they were
equally prudent in negociation, 1111
valiant in fight; and they seem to have
been scarcely more zealous in over-
coming their enemies, than anxious to
secure themselves against the oppres-
sion of those thst led them on to vic-
tory. They were individulilly to be
respected, 1111 well1111 collectively to be
feared.
The Allglo-Saxons were, like an-
cient Israel, muoh a pMtoral people;
but they seem to have been also well
acquainted with agriculture ; or, at
l8118t, they easily fell into this way of
life, 1111 if it had not been foreign to
their former habits. The lands seem
to have been, at once, divided among
the great leaders, and subdivided
among their followers, upon suoh
terms u implied a knowledge of the
value of land, and the power to ma.ke
use of it. And soon eaoh soldier be-
came a husbandman, or Willi otherwise
usefully employed in the civil affairs
of life. Like ancient Israel, they, at
first, used only hand-mills in convert-
ing their com into meal ; and such
mille were, also, in this cue, turned
by women.
AstoArchitecture,consistentwiththe
idea of their being Israel in diepersion,
they seem to have used only wooden
tabernacles, as it were, for their more
ordinary religious assemblies : but we
are expresaly told, thst their national
temples were of the most splendid
description; they were of the most
curious workmanship, and glittering
with gold. This waseven before com-
ing into Britain. During their sojourn
in the northern wildemeBB, they seem
to have got greatly into the habit of

building with wood, just as their
descendants in North America, at this
day. Before they began to build in
wood, they seem to have acquired a
great predilection for the arch. The
perfection of their arch is particularly
noted, with regard to their early tombs,
as described by Dr. Clarke.
They seem to have attained to great
perfection in the carving of wood, and
also in the gilding of wood, and the
inferior metals; but this, indeed, they
had from their fathers, even from the
time of the erection of the tabernacle
in the wilderness, as coming up out of
Egypt. The English Cathedrals appear
to have been built after the fashion
of the temples they frequented pre-
vious to their conversion to Christi-
anity. And these cathedrals, it has
been observed, seem evidently to be
built after the design of the tefnple at
Jerusalem. Like this, they have their
most holy place, the altar; and their
holy place the choir ; and the court
outward from thence, for thebodyofthe
people. The more minute parts and
ornaments will, in general, be found
exceedingly correspondent.
The working in lead and iron must
have been well understood by the An-
glo-Saxons : with the former, almost
all their churches were covered ; and
they had abundance of warlike instru-
ments provided from the latter. They
were also well skilled in the use of
the precious metals, which they
wrought up into coronets, chains,
bracelets, half-circles for dressing their
hair upon, collars, and similar articles
of usefulness and ornament-into such
articles as we know to have been in
use among the Israelites. Even the
art of polishing and setting precious
stones, were not unknown among
them. Nay, the English goldsmiths
were so famous for their art, that the
curious caskets, adorned with gold,
silver, and precious stones, in which
the relics of saints were kept, became
generally known as opera .A.nglica.
The art of making gold and silver
thread, for weaving and embroidery,
they also possessed : and the Anglo-
Saxon ladies \Jecame equally famous
125
for their needlework, as the English
goldsmiths were in their department.
-As they knew the value of property,
and had skill to acquire it, and valour
to defend, and prudence to make use
of it ; so were they equally well pro-
vided with laws for the regulations
of matters of this kind, and, indeed,
of almost every other. In criminal
cases, there was much effort at n:iaking
compensationfor the injurycommitted,
both to the injured party, and to the
king as representative of the law :
much the same as we find was ap-
pointed in ancient Israel. The farther
we go back in the history of the An-
glo-Saxons, we find their laws ap-
proximate more and more nearly to
those of Moses:
If these were the descendants of
Israel, we may also expect them to
have indications of having been a race
whose poetical genius was great, and
whose taste in this respect was highly
cultivated. And, after the examples of
David and Solomon, it might be well
expected that the employment of their
genius in poetry, for the delight and
improvement of mankind, would not
be thought beneath the most exalted
in character and station. And, accord-
ingly, we read that never were poetry
and poets so much admired as among
theAnglo-Saxons. Thegreatestprinces
were no less ambitious of the laurel,
than of the regal crown. Alfred the
Great was not only a poet himself,
but he never neglected to spend some
part of every day in getting Saxon
poems by heart, and in teaching them
to others. He made himself intimately
acquainted with the wisdom of his
Saxon ancestors: and thus, doubtless,
as well as from other sources, were so
many reforms produced in his reign,
after the preceding troubles. He has,
in several important cases, obtained
credit for having given a commence-
ment to institutions which he merely
restored. Canute the Great was also
a famous poet. The ancient bards of
the Saxon and Danish race, are said
to have produced the most astonishing
·effects upon those who heard them.
To have such power, they must have

beeD greatly uaieted by nature : b1n
nature waa evidently vaat.ly improved
by &rt. They &le eaid to have used
prodigious artifice, and an almoat eud-
leaa variety of kinds and m8118Ul'1l8 of
vane. The hamlony of theae different
kinds of vene, did not oonsiat in only
the aucceasion of long and short syl-
lables, aa among the Greeks and Ro-
JD&II8; nor in the aimilarsounds of the
terminating syllables, 88 among the
moderns; but in aoertain oonaonancy
and repetition of the 8&Dle !etten, syl-
lables, and IIOUllds, in different part& of
the atan.zu, which produoed the moat
musical tones, and affected the hear.era
with the moat marvellous delight.
Much the 8&Dle aeems to be the geuius
of Hebrew poetry, upon which the
rules of ancient Sa.xan poetry may be
expected to threw considerable light.
As to Music, for which the children
of Zion were so distinguished, and
for which the d8808Ddant& .of that
people have been so remarkable all
over the world, we have the following
acoount of the Auglo-Sa.xona:-
" Mtmic wu 88 much admired and cuJ.
tiT&ted as poetry. The halla of all the
lringa and nobles of Britain rung with the
united melody of the poet'• Yoice and mu-
mcian'a harp: while fl1'ery 111011ntain, hill,
lllld dale, W88 vocal."
As an example, Alfred the Great
excelled aa much in music, aa in war ;
and ravished his enemies with his
ha.rp, before he subdued them by his
arms. Music appears to have consti-
tuted a principal part of their heathen
· worahip,-for which they, like the
Hebrews, ha.d an immenaity of songs ;
and, aft.er their embraoe of Christi-
anity, their public, and even private
ivorahip, consisted mostly in psalmody.
In some cathedrals and large monas-
teries, perhaps 88 rivalling what ha.d
taken plaoe in their heathen temples,
and derived from their still more early
and pure way ofworship, this exercise
of singingwaa continued both day and
night, without intermission, by a con-
stant succeasion ofpriests and singers;
with whom the laity occaaionally
joined. Beaidea the harp, which wae,
[Lac. :m.
u in 1111cieut Iara.el, their moat ad-
mired instrument of muaic, all the
other kinds in use among the laraelitea,
appear to have been equally poaaeaeed
by this portion of the people who were
to come of Jacob,-& people CZ"e&ted
for the praiae of the God oE Israel.
As to that for which thia people
might be expected to be moat dietin-
guished,-Religion, or the knowledge
of the Supreme Being, and of the aer-
vioemoreimmediatelyrequiredbyHim,
the Auglo-Saxona, and their brethren
in the north of Europe, gave equally
clear indications of their laraelitiah
origin. They are described " aa having
been acquainted with the great doo-
trine of one Supreme Deity ; the Au-
thor of every thing that exieteth ; the
Eternal, the Ancient, the Living, and
Awfnl Being ; the Searcher into con-
oealed things ; the Being that never
changeth ; who liveth and governeth
during the ages; directeth every thing
which ia high, and every thing which
ia low." Of this glorious Being, they
ha.d anciently esteemed ii impious to
make any viat'ble representation, or to
imagine it possible that he could be
confined within the walla of a temple.
These great truths, the 8&111e as, we
know, were tanght to Iarael, had, in a
greatmeasure,become loator obscured,
beforethis people's coming into Britain.
But this very obscuration itself speaka
of their origin: it having chiefly takeu
place,it is eaid, in conaequenoe of their
reoeiving a mighty conqueror from the
east, as their God in human nature,
correspondent to the expectation of
Israel with regard to the Messiah.
Thiaauppoaed Godincarnate isthought
to have presented himself among these
people, about the 8&Dle time aa the
true Messiah appeared among the
Jews in the land of Iarael ; or per-
haps it may have been shortly aft.er
that, when the false Christa were de-
ceiving the Jews. The name of this
.pretender was Odin, or Woden,-the
same word, apparently, as that from
which we have Eden, and signifying
deligkt. And he was esteemed the
great diepenaer of happineaa to his fol-
lowen, u well u fury to hiJ enemiet.

When Wodm Willi removed from them,
they placed hia image in their _,
1wly place, where Willi a kind of railed
place or ark, 118 if in imitation of thai
at Jemll&lem, where, between the
Cherubim, the Divine Preeence Willi
auppoeed to abide. Here, 118 if on the
mercy -&. or throne of the God of
hrael, did they place the image of
him whom they reckoned Immanuel,
or God in our D&ture. There, al.eo,
they placed the image of hia wife
Frigga ; and, between th- two, they
fixed the image of Thor, who Bat
orowned in the centre. Outward of
theae three, by the aide ofWoden, waa
the image of Tueeco; and by the aide
of Frigga, wu Seater or Saturn; and
outward of Tueeco, wu a representa-
tion of the Moon; and outward of Sa-
turn, Wll8 placed an image of the Sun.
Thus Thor, after whom we still call
the middle day ofthe week Thursday,
wu in the centre ; hia father Woden,
from which we have Weduesday ; and
his mother Frigga, from which we have
Friday, were with armour, on either
aide of him : whilat outwards from
these are the more peacefvl deitiea ;
Tueaoo, from which we have Tueaday;
and Saturn, from which we have Sa-
turdayr-end, most outward of all, we
have the two great luminaries, the
moon, from which we have Monday,
and the aun, after which we have Sun~
day. In the arrangement of these false
olijects of worship, and in the oorre-
apondent naming rL the several daya of
the week, they manifested that same
regard to symmetry, in which ancient
Israel W118 trained, and for which their
English deacendantB are so remark-
able. Th- gods, it may be al.eo re-
marked, are the very same they had
been threatened with. They were the
sun and moon, and new gods which
had come newly up. Before this ele-
vation, or ark, in this most holy place,
on which the symbols of their worship
were placed, they had an altar, on
which the holy fire burned continu-
ally ; and near it wu a vue for re-
ceiving the blood of the victims, and a
bruh for sprinkling the blood upon
the people ; reminding ua again of
what Willidone in anclentluael. They
had generally, one great temple for
the whole nation, and in one of theae,
it is particularly noticed, they had
twel'Y8 prieBta, presided over by a
high priest, and having under their
charge the religious concerns of the
whole people. Thia temple is said to
have been of the most splendid de-
ICription,--of inoredible grandeur and
1118fP1ificenoe. n wu at upea1a, in
Sweden. In the neighbourhood of the
M1ll8 place, was, and atill is preaerved
a pavement of eleven or twelve atonea,
where the penon took hia stand that
conduotecl the election of the king
unong the peopleinhabitingthatcoun-
try. "hrael, it may llf!llln be remarked,
had one great temple for the whole na-
tion:-but, beside this, they had their
rural wonbip, which wu generally in
grovea; and the Anglo-Saxona hadthe
very aame anangament. We have, in
abort, every agreement of theae people
with ancient Israel, 1111 to religion; u-
cept in those respects which have been
anticiJ*ed by the Spirit of prophecy,
and that from their very oommence-
1118Dt 118 a nation, under Mosea; and
which, therefore, no leu than what
they had retained of the Mosaic insti-
tutions, tend to fix their identity.
Nor ahould we forget that th- peo-
ple hadthe lsraelitiah division of Time.
Their day wu from evening to even-
ing, and their weeks, 1111 we have seen,
consisted, like those of the Hebrews, ·
ofaeven daya: andbyouratillretaining
the heathen namea for the days of the
week, it is quite evident that thie divi-
sion of time had long tlltiated among
the people, previoua to their becoming
acquainted with the institutions of
Mosea through their Christian instruc-
tors. It may also be observed, that
there were three great festivals among
the Hebrews, in the course ofthe year,
at which all their malea were to pre-
sent themselves before the Lord.
Theae are repeatedly mentioned in the
books of Mosea, as in Dent. xvi. 16,
17:--

See, also, Exodus, xxili. 14-17;-

The Anglo-S&xons had also three
great festival& before their conversion
to Christianity ; the first of which,
(Ea&ter) exactly correspond& to the
P8880ver,-the first of the feuta ap-
pointed l8r88l ; and, even after their

festival W88 retained ; so that we BtiJJ.
ca.ll it Eaater,-tbe name of the festi-
val, which, at the B&lDe time of tbe
year, they had previo1181y observed ;
and which they had evidently brought
with them from the eaat. The aeoond
feaat WIB Wbitauntide, correapondent
to the Hebrew Pentecoat, or feut of
weelta ; when, upon the fiftieth day
after the PB880ver, the first fruita were
offered with rejoicing ; and hence it
WB8 ca.lled WAite-Sunday, becallll8 of
their then appearing in garment& that
indicated rejoicing. The third great
feaat among the Hebrews, W88 the
feaat of Tabernacles. It iB particularly
noted, that the Anglo-Saxona were in
the habit of congregating to their great
8888Mbly,-tbe Witena Gemot, thrice
in the year. And the two first of tbeae
times exactly correspond to the two
firat great feaats of ancient larael. At
thiB great 888embly all the males were
supposed to be preaent, if not in per-
son, at Jeaat by their representatives;
which WB& probablr also the case in
ancient 1Br881. Nor did they appear
empty ; their principal object being to
arrange with regard to the offeringa to
be preaented to the king, 88 previously
they bad, at such times, paid their tri-
bute to their God,-who WB8 king in
I81'&81, previous to the time of Saul.
The priesthood, 88 in l&r881, W88
confined to certain families, and de-
scended from father to son. In ancient
Israel the priesthood bad their pos-
sessions in land, and they had much
to do in the declaring of the Jaw; and
ao,~trary to what existed in the
· ·tive Christian Churoh,- the

the clergy. And their conrte were
given a degree of authority which they
did not before possess, and which they
very speedily abueed. Then, also,

in theae countries, after the Ian.elitiah
pattern. Theae offering&, we have
every reaaon to believe, had been pre-
viously made to the priesthood be-
longing to that corrupted form of He-
brew worabip, which the Saxona
brought with them into Britain. Upon
their embrace of the Christian faidJ,
the revenues of the former worabip
were appropriated to the use of the
Christian priesthood : just aa, after-
warda we find them taken from tbe
church, 88 in connection with Rome,
and given to the support of the Pro-
testant worabip. They did not be-
long to the Churob of Rome, but to
the Cburoh of the Anglo-S&x0118.
Popery purloined them for a time, but
they have been, so far, l'OOOTered.
When Gregory ~~ent his miasionaries
to the English, to procure their adhe-
sion to the see of Rome, they were in-
structed not to destroy the heathen
temples- but only to remove the
images of their goda,-to WB8h the
walls with holy water,-to erect altars,
and deposit relics in them,-fllld so
convert them into Christian ohurobes;
not only to save the expense of build-
ing new ones, but that the people
might be the more easily prevailed
upon to frequent these places of wor-
Bhip,-they having been previously ao-
oustomed to B888mble there. He di-
rect& them further, to accommodate
the ceremonies of the ChriBti&n wor-

the Heathen, that the people might
not be much startled by the change:

a portion of thole that were to ocme of

Their change to nominal ChriiJ&ian-
ity, and the a.dmiuion amoag them of
the New Testament Soriptures,as well
as their recovery of their own Old
Testament writings, at the time of
Gregory, was a partial restoration to
the light and favour of God. Thill

of Christ five hundred and ninety-two;
before which, partial conversions may
havetaken place in different. port.ionsof
the Angl~Saxon population, throagh

tim Christians; 10 thet their conver-
eion may be IBid to have taken place
about the middle of the ~pace of time
which has elapsed sinoe the captivity
of lmlel ~d their sojourn in the
northern wilderness may be reckoned
about one thousand t.wo hundred and
threeaoore years. Sinoe that, they
have, with all their beckalidiaga, been,
upon the whole, malting progress.
After two days (a thoueand years
beingfor a day) the Lord revived them
by the· Reformation ; the dawn of
which, in Europe, had amoag them
been given, when WioklliF appeared,
-immediately after the two tholll&lld
years from the time of their captivity.
.At the Reformation, there was another
recovery of the Soriptorea, and release
from the service of idols ; and there
was a clearer exhibition of the one
great truth of the Gospel, than had
ever been before enjoyed. This, how-
ever, they reoeived with too great in-
difference. It required to be beaten
and burned into them by the blood7
peneoutions under Mary:-when they
were taaght the 'Y&lue of the doctrine
ofjustification through faith alone, in
the crucified Redeemer, by it.s power
in sustaining through suffering and
death, in aaloua devotedness to the
service of God.

to oontinue the brotherly intercourse1

judgment written. For, the Tyrianll
refusing to admit Alexander u a
ma.ster, be wholly demolished old
Tyre, on the continent, to ID&ke a
causeway, whereby toreach New Tyre,
which wu previoll!ly an island; and,
having effected his purpose, be burnt
it down to the ground, and destroyed.
or enslaved all the inhabitants. Eigbt
thousand be slew, in sacking the town;
two thousand were crucified; and
thirty thousand were sold as slaves.
It is no extrav~t idea to suppose
that the Lacedemonians had been
slaves, who bad, by some means, ob-
tained their freedom. The two thou-
sand Tyrians who were crucified, bad
this sentenoe executed upon them,
under the pretext that they were
descended of slaves, who bad con-
spired against their masters, and mur-
dered them all in one night; and mar-
rying their mistresses, bad continued
in possession of the town, in the room
of their former lords.
Now, if the Jews, who were farther
removed from the Mediterranean sea,
and who have not, in Scripture, so
much said about their multiplicity,-
if they thus early were sending in this
way their branches into the west,-
mucb more may we expect to find
the extension of the other bouse of
Israel in this direction : their increase,
and their ecattering in the isles, being
so much the subject of prophecy; and
the far greater part, about two-thirds,
of their tribesbips, reaching down to
the coast of the Great Sea, thus afford-
ing them every facility for their con-
veyanoe in this direction.
By mention being made in Isaiah,
chap. x., verse 20, of " the escaped of
the bouse of Jacob," as well as of
"the remnant of Israel," which had
been taken captive by the Assyrians;
it seems to be intimated, that a con-
siderable number bad fled from the
land, rather than remain to be led
away at the will of the enemy. This
was the more likely, as those dwelling
along the coast of the Great Sea, bad,
nineteen years before the great cap-
tivity, warning given them by the for-
cible removal of those that lived east-
ward of the Jordan. In the space of
these nineteen years, between the two
captivities, many, doubtless, eecaped;
and it may partly have been to prevent
the greater withdrawal of Israel from
under their yoke, that the Assyrian&
came up, and swept away the remnant
so entirely. The way of eecape wu
westward, down the Mediterranean
sea, or into Egypt. Every other door
of hope &eemed to be closed against
them. With regard to Egypt, it
bad been said by the prophet Hosea
(ix. 3.), " Ephraim aball return to
Egypt:" and again (verse 6), "Egypt
aball gather them up, Memphis shall
bury them." Memphis, it may be re-
marked, is that city of Egypt, in the
neighbourhood of which are the Pyra-
mids and other remarkable burying
places. It would appear by the lan-
guage of this prophecy, that the dis-
persed of Israel would be prized in
Egypt; and that they would there be
honoured in their burial. And it is,
perhaps, worthy of notice, that shortly
after the A88yrian captivity, the influ-
ence of Israel does &eem to have been
felt in Egypt,-as, then, a singular
revolution took pllioe, approximating
their government to that of the twelve
tribes. Upon the death of the king,
who reigned over Egypt, in the time
of Sennacberib, king of Assyria, the
Egyptians, says Herodotus, (Euterpe,
cxlvii.), recovered their freedom; and
chose twelve kings, among whom they
divided the different districts of Egypt.
Thus, immediately after the Assyrian
captivity, an elective government wu
established in Egypt, and that con-
sisting of twelve communes; and this,
during the very life-time of the refu-
gees belonging to the twelves tribes of
Israel. Egypt, however, does not seem
to have been the soil in which the
seed of liberty could then firmly take
root, however rapidly it might spring
up. These twelve kings were they
who built the celebrated labyrinth,
near the lake MOlris, and to which,
Herodotus says, even the pyramids
were inferior. It was composed of ·
twelve covered courts, six towards the
north, and six to the south; and three
Digitized b

above, of incredible. grandeur and
beauty. Theae are now mppoaed to
be covered by the eand. The r&-<>pen-
~ of them, Savll".f auppoeea, may
throw considerable light upon the paet
history of man; and possibly, our own
subject would profit thereby, u much
u any. · But although Israel would,
u to a portion of them, find thua an.
uylum and oooupation in Egypt, they
were not then to oontinue; they were
not then to take root. After the pea-
eages of Hoaea, already referred to, it
is said of Ephraim, (chap. xi.), " He
shall not return into the land of
.Egypt." There no more would they
find that reet which they 10ught to
obtain, u ·forgetting their Maker, and
building temples, and chooeiug altare
to sin. The Egyptian Commonwealth
wae speedily diaeolved, and one of the
twelve, called Peammitacua, obtained
the supreme command. From that
time, Egypt appeera to have been
thrown open to strangers; and, doubt-
Ieee, then aleo many of the freedom-
seeking Egyptians removed to other
countrieL The Israelitiah refugee•
would be foremoet in this new emi-
gration.
On the opposite .-side of the Medi-
terrane~~~~, in the.. extremity of Alia
Minor, we find thereafter springing up
another, the loman Commonwealth,
oonaiating of twelve tn"bes 'or etateB;
and, resembling the . Iaraelitiah go-
vernment, a limited monarchy. It is
cleerly iliferred from Herodotus,•that
their having a comnionwealth of just
~lve etatee, wae a matter of choice,
and not of. chance. They had the
same political arrangements previous
to their irettling in this part of the
world, and when beiug placed aloug
the western coaet of Gteeoe:-where
the islands are situated, that are now
called the Ionian ~ublic, under the
protection of the Bntiah nation.
The Ioni&ne appeer to have poa-
seaeed 10me of the strougelt charao-
teriatics of' Israel. They were remark-
able, alike, for pereonal beauty, and
for the beauty of ~ Bituation,-to

markable for their mental vigour, and
love of liberty. Their ooDDeCtion
with the Egyptians was moat intimate;
and they are aaid to be the first amoDg
the Greeks who undertook loug voy•
agee. They had, as we have inti-
mated, been in rather a wanderiDg
state, previous to their settlement in
Ionia,-where, at lBDgth, ae in a
eecond Eden, they had taken up their
abode. But this wu not to be their
reat. They appeer to have been given
this position, in order that they might
etill more extensively be 10wn over
the world; u if to give the fulleat
eoope for the execution ofthe eentence
pronounced upon Simeon by Jacob:-
" Simeon and Levi are brethren; I
will divide them in Jacob, and ecatter
them in Israel." (Gen. xli.x. 5, 6.)
Three several timea were they reduced
by the Peraiaua, and by them 10wn
over the earth. Some of them were
carried even as filr ae to Ampe, a city
said to be neer the Erythrean Sea,
where it receives the watere of the
Tigris. And it is worthy of remark,
that this diaperlion took place in oon-
eequence of a revolt, ooceaioned by
their tear of being replaced in the land
of~---abo~thesametimethat
the Jews had their captivity returned.
They had not, like the Jews, been
· forcibly drawn away from the land of
promise. They had voluntarily ab&D-
doned it, ae a land that ~evoured ita
inhabitants, and they had found a
happyhome abroad. Theyhadbecome
alienated alike from the throne of
David, and the Temple of Jerusalem,
10 that what was joy to the Jews, was
naturally a terror to them. The term
brethren, 10 emphatically applied ·to
Simeon and Levi, appeers to have
been much in uae in this quarter.

It is VflrJ' probable that these were
the elder brethren of the Angles; that
they were of Manaaseh-of that half
of this tribe wQich bordered upon the
Great Sea; and who had, equally with
Asher, Dan, and Simeon, an opportu-
nity of escaping westward ; and who
had at length reached these isles afar
off. From early settling among the
Cimbri in the north of Europe, and
learning their language, they would
naturally be called by their name.
'fhey have indeed become Manuseh,
having " forgotten all their father's
ho1188." If they are of the elder bro-
ther of Ephraim, the prophecy has
fullybeen aooompliahed(Isaiah ix.21),
Manaasehhubeen devouringEphraim,
and Ephraim Manaaseh, and they to-
gether have been against Judah. And
if the escaped of Israel have thus been
strewed along the oout of Europe,-
the very country into which the rem-
nant, carried captive, were about to
come; ifthose whofled westward have
come into the very quarter into which
those who were taken away north-
eastward .in bonda have ultimately
been bronght; and where the two long
separated streams have commingled,
and thence apread their fructifying in-
fluence all over the globe,-then, so
far, has also that prophecy been ful-
filled, which, at the time it was given,
seemed most difficult of fulfilment,
(Mic. ii. 12, 13):-
" I will aurely auemble,

I will aurely ptber

The Breaker Ia come up before tbem:
They heve broken up;
And have palled through the gate ;
And are gone out by It ;
And tbeir Xing ohall pall before tbem,
And tbe Lcml on the head of tbem."
They have been gathered together
into one place, and the Lord hath
there kept them 88 a shepherd doth
hia aheep. The Breaker, the great
beut, the fourth empire, tha~ breaketh
ia pieces the whole earth, came up be-
fore them. They were obliged to 8880-
ciate more closely together, and break ·
up that which aimed at their utter
destruction. They obtained potlll886ion
of the gate of their enemies, and have
gone out by it. And their kiBg hath
passed before them, to receive for him-
self the kingdom, and to return; when
he shall be found, the Lord on the
heed ofthem. Their multiplicity,their
mpplanting the nationa,and the cause
of the joy they are chosen to declare
to the world (Chriatin his firat and ae-
cond advents), areall here pointed out.
Israel hath thus been indeed the
Lord'a measuring line, from the very
time of their calling, and being plaoed
in the promised land. They have been
enc!OIIing one portion after another of
the human race, until now, that, in a
manner, they embrace the world. We
have already adverted to the fact of
Jerusalem's having been, until the
time of David, retained 88 a Canaan-
itiah city. It W88 enclosed within the
bounds of Israel, who were dwelling
on all &ides of it; and at length it W88
taken up into the Lord's inheritance;
and W88 chosen, above all place&, for
the God of Israel to place his name
there, and where his . congregation
should be established before him. .Af-
terward&, by the .Aasy:rians, the body
of the people were removed farlher
back into the north. ·Their place in
Samaria W88 lea to be filled with a
firat-fruits ofa variety ofothernations,
who were enclosed within the remain-
ing portion of the Lord's people : the
Jewa, dwelling in Judea and Galilee,
and having these Gentilea, inhabiting
Samaria,in theircentre. Andthe Lord,
in going down from Judea into Gali-
lee, " must needs go throngh Sama-
ria ;" and his apostles followed in the
same course; and the Samaritans came
into a participation of the blesaings of
the Gospel, u being thus bronght into
ooJ\iunction with Iarael. They were
bleB&ed 88 being in the way in which
the Lord went; and in which he aent
his m8888ngera forth for the ble&lliug
of hia chosen people, the lot of hia in-·
heritance. Our Saviour's personal mi-:

• been IICOOIDpllahing Iince. Aa Sama-
ria, occupied by the Gentiles, lay be-
tween the two portiollll of the Jews,
Judea and Galilee; and aa it W&l the
latterwhich waa the great 11061le of bia
preaobiDgand doinggood: eo, between
the land of laraeJ. and tbia goodly
heritajJe of the hoet of natiOIUI here in
die north-welt, interpoeed a tract of
country mainly poaeeeeed by the Gen-
tilee, through which the Gospel had to
paaa, &I it had to pua through Sama-
ria ; and here, aa in Galilee, in lhe
most north-west portion of the land,
baa been the greatest dilplay of the
goodneu and ma.nitestation ofthe un-
weariedcare of the Shepherd ofll!l'llel.
-Even all along tbia line, in which
the Gospel baa travelled westward,
were, aa we have aeen, placed portions
of the people who had been prepared
for the name or Jehovah, to transmit
it &om one part to another, until it
reached these " isles afar off," whence
it waa to be declared unto all the ends
of the earth. The Gentiles have come,
and are coming, into the possession of
bleuing, aa being encompassed by Is-
rael, the lot, the measuring line, of the
Lord's inheritance. The great bodJ:
ofthe people had been either led into
lhe north, or were fted into the west.
They had encircled the western coast
of Aaia Minor; and that W&l taken
into the Lord'a inheritance. There,
waa the great preaching of the Gospel,
and planting of churches, in Apostolic
times. But laraeJ. had encompassed
Greece; they were to the north, and
south, and weR, of Macedonia: and
that became thence a carefully la-
boured portion Of the vineyard. But
Israel had ~ed to the north-
west of ltaly.-They had, aa it were,
encloeed Rome: and it, also, became
bleaeed with lbe preaching, and one
of the moat valuable epi1tlea of the
apoitle. But not only have portions of
the -ped of Israe1, come into the
weet:-" the fnlneu of nations," pro-
mised to Ephraim, have been brought
furth; and have come into the poaaea-
lion of the extreme north and west.
They have, like the palm-tree, been
187
long in proving worthy of their name,
Ephraim, that is, frvitfvl : but u
length the time baa come, that tb,ey
abonld be bleued, and be the mea.na
of bleuingall the natiollll of the earth.
And accordingly, the light travels on-
waro; the sap progreaaeain the branch
of the Lord's planting: the Albigelll161
appear in the north of Italy, and tea-
UtY to die limple truths of God'•
word, in opposition to all the thick
darkneu that W&l then covering the
earth. The witneaae& thereafter ap-
pear, &I Walden&es, on the north-west
of the Alpe. .Afterwards, the same
doctrines are proclaimed by Wickliff,
&till further west, in England; and bia
voice reaches even afar east, to Bohe-
mia. And then in the north, unong
the Saxons, stand& forth the bold
Luther, denouncing, in the atrongeet
terms, the man of Bin ; who, having
" defiled the temple of God," shall be
by God de&troyed ; fur the temple of
God iB holy ; which temple, said the
apostle, to some of the firllt reached of
the European popnlation,-" which
temple ye are." Here iB the place
within the vail,whichshall be cleansed.
" The idols he will utterly aboliah ;"
" and the Lord alone ahall be exalted
in that day." And now W&l declared
in its fulneBB, the doctrine of free ju&-
tifioation, by the blood of Je1118.
Speaking of the preBB, which W&l
then beltowed upon them, Fox, the
martyrologilt, thua expreaees himeelf:
"Herebytooguea arelmowu,lmowledge

apected die Land, and die Seed. They
also implied die resurrection of the
eaints; ~ng that to dieae fathers the
Land was prom.iaed, aa well aa to their
children: although,duringtheir former
life-time, they were not given " eo
mnch aa even to aet their foot on,"-
yet, af\erdiey were dead, God still de-
clarea himself to be the God of Abra-
ham, Iaaac, and Jacob, aa if He still
intended to fulfil the prom.iaee made
unto them; whicb He could not do
bnt by raising them from the dead;
and thus, indeed, it ia that our Saviour
proves the reaurrection.-{Matt. xxii.
31, 32.) The aeed prom.iaed unto the
fathers, respected, aa we aaw, a double
aeed;-the One Seed, Chriat, to whom
the land waa abaolutely prorniaed ;
and the multitudinous aeed, to be
blessed in Him, and made a bleeeing
unto all the earth. This multitudin-
oua aeed waa, aa we aaw, distinguiahed
from a merely adopted posterity; and
alao from die posterity of Ishmael and
of Esau.-Ofthe eons of.Jacob, Joeeph
was choeen, and of hia eons, Ephraim,
to be the father of thia cboeen aeed,
thia multitude of natioll8. He was aa
truly to be the fadier of a fulnesa or
multitude of nations, as Judah was to
be, according to the fteah, the father
of the One Seed,·Chriat.
God avowed, from the beginning, hie
purpoee of m&king thia numerous aeed
a blessing to the nationa. They were
to oonstitute a kind of measuring line,
by whicb one portion af\er another
would be taken into die Lord's inhe-
ritanoe. For thia, they required a pe-
culiar training, that they might be
fitted for all places, and all atations;
for acquiring and communicating all
knowledge, to all the families of man-
kind ; and especially, the knowledge
of God, aa presented in hia word.-
Thia training, we aaw, dieyweregiven
progressively, and continuously, in the
fathers ; and after they became a na..
tion, until the very eve of dieir depar-
ture from the land.
We aaw that the purpoee of God,
with regard to Israel, aa avowed from
the beginning, ·was not accompliahed
during their eqjourn in die land.-
And we might have more fully aeen,
that when they were being taken away,
as well as continually afterwards,God,
by the prophete, recognized die pro-
mises He had made, and declarea they
ahall yet be fulfilled. We aaw that the
captivity was comJ>lete, except as to
thoee that escaped out of the land ;
and that thoee that were taken away
captive, rere removed into the north
country,-into the aame quarter as
that to which hiatory tracee the Saxon
raoe.
We have adverted tothe caae of die
other house of Israel, which were lef\
in the land, and which have generally
borne the name of Jews; and who &1"8'
euppoaed to have remained distinct
from all other people. We aaw that
the best portion of this house must
have become mingled among the Gen-
tiles ;-1Uld die worat of the Gentiles
-the children emphatically of the
curse, the Edom.ites and the Canaan- .
ites,-have become one with them;-
that they have beconie gnilty of the
sin of both, and have been enduring
the curae ofboth;-1Uld that they have
nothing in the flesh whereof to boast,
and cannot obtain posaeBBion of the
land by their own covenant, but ouly
aa being viewed in the One Seed,
Chriat, and joined to the multitudin-
oua aeed to come of die odier house
of Israel, that of Ephraim.
We then went forth in aearch ofthia
loat house of Israel ; and, reasoning
from analogy, as to the distn"bution of
die three families of Abraham, among
die three grand racea of mankind, we
were led to look northward, among
the children of Japhet. We lli.w, more-
oYer, that the word of God expreaaly
point& northward, aa to the place into
whicb Ephraim had gone, and out of
whicb they are chiefly to be brought.
In that direotion are we alao pointed
by the great prophetic line ofempires;
and by the progreBB of Israel's puniah-
ment. And thither, also, tendod, al-
most invariably, the feet of all thoee
who were divinely appointed to admi-
nilter the word, ·which waa specially
promiaed to light upon Israel ; and of
whicb he was to be die great adminia-

trator to lhe natione. The preaching
of Christ, and hie apoetlee ; and lhe
epistles, and Apocalypse,-all afford
the clearest proof of the pecn1iar and
intenae interest felt by the great
Shepherd of Israel, in the norlh and
north· west.
Having thus aecertained our course,
we then prcoeeded north-west of the
places to which Israel had been ca.r-
ried: and we immediately met wilh
lhe " high heape," which 181'1181 raised
in the.;p-ay 81 they went; and, upon
examination, we found them to con-
tain tombe, having every indication of
being 181'118litieh. They are, moreover,
l!ll.id to be those of the ancestors of the
Khazares or Coman~ the ancestors of
the Coeeacks, of the B&me race with
the Anglo-Saxone. We B&W that the
names of riven between the Don and
the Danube, give aleo clear indications
of Israel's eojoum there; and 8TIIn lhe
country eouth of the Danube, M<Mia,
the ancient inheritance of the Gete or
Goths, with all else, seemed to tell,
that here were the disciples of Moses.
We saw that many a time were l11111el
there affiicted:-by the Persians, the
Macedonians, the Romans, succes-
sively were they attacked; and, more
and more, subjected to slaughter; and
ultimately, by the Barbarians, were
they driven in upon the Roman em-
pire, and obliged to occupy their pre-
sent important position. We then
took a glance at the most ancient
poem which these nations are l!ll.id to
possess, containing their traditional
prophecies; and we B&w that it bean
full evidence to their being the chil-
dren of the prophets, who had both
foretold these calamities, and aleo the
future bleseedneBB of the " eons of the
two brothers," in the house of their
father.
We then BBw that the word of pro-
phecy,by Isaiah, clea.rlyforetelslsrael's
being brought out into these maritime
parts, whilst the nations, their ene-
mies, would pasa away from before
them; and they be given place here,
in which to renew their strength.
And we B&w that the great Whirl-
wind, described by Jeremiah, 81 being
raised up from the ends of the earth,
and aweeping once, and again, and a
third time around Jerusalem, ulti-
mately spends its fury in the north,
and describes that dreadful confusion
wliich took place there, at lhe time
the Roman empire W8l broken up.
And we BBW that the dreadful incur-
sions upon the Germans ; and the sub-
sequent breaking forth of the Gothic
nations, are described correspondently
in history. And ·we BBW that the
changes then produced in Europe, of
all kinds, bore ample testimony to the
truth, that the new nations that were
then given these countries in ~
Bion, were the nations that were to
come of Jacob. ·
We then chose a B&mple in which
more particularly to exemplify lhe
truth of our proposition. We ihowed
that the Anglo-Sa.xona came from' th8'
eut of Europe; and are even traced
beck into Asia, to the very quarter
unto which Israel had been taken cap..
tive; and that they posse88ed all the
marks, physical; moral, and intell-
tual, which were given to I11111el, llli
qualifying them for their important
position among the nations; the very
position which had been promised to
Israel, and for which they had been
all along in training. WeB&w, farther;
that the IIIT8Jl8eiilents of their eociety,
in their domestic, and aleo in their
civil relations, were most minutely
correspondent; and that all the pecu-
liar excellencies of the EugliBh con-
stitution, they have received, through
a Saxon medium, from their Iaraelitiah
forefathers. We aleo B&W that their
skill in the arts, useful and orna.men-
tal,-t~nd particularly, those connected
with religious worahip,-equelly bore
evidence to the truth that this W81 the
very race which had been trained un-
der Moses. Their religion iteelf, with
all its predicted corruptions, was, we
saw, equally full of the same decisive
evidence. And the marvel came
rather to be, that eo much had been
left to this people, to bear such ample
and undeniable evidence to the truth
of their origin. And we BBW that
God's dealings with them, ainoe their

moved by tbe Spirit ~ God." It is
the Divine Hind, themore, and not
the mind of the private individual,
which is to be sought for in Scripture.
God ill a God of truth; just and right
ill He: and He will yet fully vindicate
both his word and his ways. I trust
that, to this, will be seen to condnae
the view which we have been taking
of Israel, whom the word of God very
much concerns, from the time that the
promiaea were 110 aU1'8ly given to the
fathers, and throughout both history
and prophecy, until they have iasued in
the promieed multitude of nations,
who have, fl'fen all'8ady, 80 far sup-
planted their enemiea, and been made
a joy unto all the earth.
I cannot bnt acknowledge the very
great obligations under which I am to
the new Science of Mind,-which In-
fidelity bu been latterly trying to
make its own; and which many Chris-
tJana have tooweakly conoeded to the
enemies of the truth. As far u my
experience goes, all trne knowledge
tenda to confirm the word of God;
but no branch of ecience, with which
I am acquainted, bu this tendency
m01'8 than Phrenology, when rightly
understood. Of this, I have had many
Yf!IIZI' experience ; and can truly
say, that by this consideration have I
been chiefly inll.uenoed in the atten-
tion I have for lfl'ferai years bean
giving to this,-certr.inly one of the
moat important branches of human
knowledge. The beautiful and minute
adaptation ~the word·of God to the
mind of man,-the value of that men-
tal training which God bu bean giv-
ing to his choeen people,-the distinc-
tion of races, 80 constantly·made in
Seriptu1'8,- and that great law or
nature and of Providence, whereby the
child is viewed in the parent, and the
pai'8Dt ia, u it were, dealt with in the
ohild,-oould not have been 80 well
understood, without the true know-
ledge of man's mental constitution,
afforded by Phrenology. It is a most
important movement in divine Provi-
dence, that this Science is beginning
to arrest the attention of those whose
minds have been turned ' away from
the word of God. I would very
earnestly recommend the Christian,
and the Ph1'8nologist, to take a closer
and more impartial view of each
other's labours. Suspicion is, perhaps,
well, in such a cue, when it leads to
a strict scrutiny, 80 that nothing may
be received but what is truth; but
when it turns awayfrom the truth, its
injuryis incalculable. No trne scienoe
bu anything to fear from free and full
investigation ; but much from miare-
pre!!entation and neglect. And even
granting that Phrenology bu been
abused (and thia has been the case
with everything, however good, which

this ahould Jl.ot prevent ita legitimate
uae. Nay, we should be the more

hu already partly aooompliahed:-
eee his Hiatory of the Anglo-Saxona,

And now-may we not more and
more admire the truth and faithful-
ness of the God of Israel, eeeing that
the promiseswhich He made unto our
fathers, and confirmed by his oath,-
and upon which eo much with regard
to our faith, and especially our hope,
is in the New Testament built,-He
hath ful1llled, or ia fulfilling, all, ex-
actly as waa declared from the begin-
ning of time? We eee that these pro-
mises were more than mere words;
and that the use which is made of
them in the reasoning of the a~es,
ld
ia PlOI'II legitimate aDd oonalrui:ft,
than the whiaperbaga of our unlleli.af

eamest of what wu to come, when
there should be the greater redemp-
tion, and more permanent poeeesaioo.
Then, at\er that, '11111 " tl)e ear," when,
under David, the proper kingly type

Hope of gloryr-when Ephraim shall

Cbriat, who ia the One Son, the Heir
of all thiugs; and He by whom the
many eons shall be led into glory.
Such ia the gloriou end at which we
are to aim,-the glory of God, in the

of the earth. Let us eow the seed: it

God aright. Let ue bow that word

others. Such ia the work to which

who hath fulfilled the ooVebant, ia
alone the rightful Heir of the earthly
poaaeeaion, u well 88 of the heavenly
Inheritanoe. True, hia people are
heira with him, and ahall inherit all
things;-bnt he hath promiaed Him-
eelf to come, andgive them poeeel8ion.
And when He COIII8II, we ahall live
together with Him, and atand in hia
preeence, and be oonatimtedkings and
prieeta unto God, if now, patiently
continuing in well-doing, we ·~.
through Him, for glory, and honour,
and immortalityI
Now we may - how it ia, that the
north and weat have been 80 pecu-
liarly favonred;-why it W88 that the
journeye of the apoatlea, and their
epistles, all prooeeded in thia direo-
uon; although the eut and 80Uth
were vaatly more populoua:-1Uld how
il ia, that many great empirea are
paaed over; and thoae that run, 88 it
were, in a line north-weatward, are
puticularly notioed in prophecy;-
and how it is 80 muoh ia aaid abonl

of Israel ;-and how all the peculiar
blelllinga of God, aa the God of Pro-
vidence, 88 well aa of Redemption,
have henoe arisen, or hither have been
aent.
Thus, al80, may we account for the
univeraal and continually improying
geniua of the raoe now inhabiting
Europe:-& race, evidently deaigned
to spread abroad, and cover the globe;
- race, in every respect fitted for
univeraality; and, eapecially, for being
the teaohera of the world. They are
a people formed by God himeelf, for
the special deaign of showing forth hia
praiae.
Now, alao, may we - wherefore it
ia, that all the varied inatnunentalily,
for the acquiring and commnnioating
bleeainga of all kinda, to all pert& of
the earth, baa been bestowed upon
theee nations; and wherefore mob fa..
vourable positions, 80 widely acatlered,
and 80 varioualy placed, all over the
globe, have been given to the British
nation, in particular. The like hath
not been done to any nation, aa to
this;-and the position which ia occu-
pied by England, is that unto whioh
Israel ia called, and for whioh they
were gifted: and " the gifts and call-
ing of God are withont repentanoe."
And now behold the important po-
sition of theee nations,aa being equally
related to the Jew and the Gentile;
the brethren of them both they are,
that they should do good unto both,
aa God may give them oppormnity,-
and thia He ia doing abundantly.
They have the Jews among them, and
they are among the Gentilea;-and
the God of Israel, the Master of the
harveat, ia looking on, and aoon will
appear to the joy of thoee who have
given themeelvea to hie eervioe. Let
us duly regard the claima our God baa
upon us, for moat loving and lively
obedienoe. He hath, indeed, been un-
oealling in hia care, and marvelloua in
hia love, to the honee of Israel. He
ia indeed fulfilling hia word,-
" In the place where It wu l&ld unto them,
Ye are not my people;
There itshall be 1aid unto them,

.. Calmet has a Dileertation prefixed to
the Book of Chronicles, • On the Country
to which the Ten Tribes were taken, and
on !hal in which they nuw are ;' giving
various opinions to his day, and giving
his own opinion, that the ten tribes gra.
dually returned, and ao fullllled the pro-
phecies. Mr. Wolf's Journals, from Ul81

parts of the east (see, for instance, Jewish

remnanta of the Ten, u well as of the Two

"It may be right bore to notice Mr.
W'W.OO's recent work on our 1111'8elilillh
Origin. I have read it without 8Z17 coo.
viction. Believing with him in the same
hope of the restoration of Israel and tl>e
personal reign ofour Saviour, I cannot but
regret that ao pioua a writer should, on ao
ecanty a foundation, seek to eatablish a
system which apPe&!'S to me to confound
the distinct situation ofJews and Gentiles,
and the peculiarity of the divine Jove in
the times oC the Gentiles. However, his
work may be naeful in ca.lling attention to
the subject, and suggeWug thoughta to
other minda; his aysan is, in my .view,
unsupported in ita proolil, and contra:y to
the plain testimony of Scripture. lnatead
of blindness in part happening to Israel,
and the fulness of the elect among the
Gentiles now coming in, this view would
make, in the whole of the Gentile diapen..
aation, Israel the seeking people, ancfthe
Gentiles the blinded people, and deatroy
the oontrut of the apostle between Jews
and Gentiles. The sovereignty of God on
this hypothesis, would be reaolved into a).
most a carnal and mechanical aelection of
one family, instead of that lalgenea and
Culness of love which the Hot, Scriptures
reveal, which has D.o respect of persona,
but deals both rigbteoully and gracioualy
with the whole human race. There ap-
pears more reason to think there is a foun-
dation for the opinion that the original
American Indians were of the ten tribes,
u shown with a good deal of apparent
evidence in Mrs. Simon's "Ten-Tribes
ldentifted," but we have no certaiDty yet
respecting them. The Rev. J. SIDiuel, in
a volume entitled, • The Remnant Found,
or thePlace of Israel's Hiding Di~'
endeavours to show that the Jews of Dag-
histan, on the Caspian Sea, are the rem-
nant or the ten tribes ; and his own evi-
dence of this is brought forward. They
were Yiaited by him in 1887 and 1888 ;
but in any case this can only be a trag.
ment of the whole. Finn's History of the
Jews in Spain and Porlngal containaIDtlllh
valuable information."
That you are, with many others,
beginning to see the importance ofthe
subject, is indicated by your obeerviDg
with regard to the Ten Tribea, that "it
will hereal\er be really an objeot of
great interest to the Gentilee, tQ search
them out." Tohave contributed to pro-
duce the conviction that the people
more particularly pointed out as the
objeota of bleesing, the house of Iara.el,
-divoroed from under the law, in
order to be eapouaed to the Lord ac-
cording to the terms of the Golpel
diepensation,-to have helped to pro-
duce the conviction that thie people,
eo truly and everlaatinglr loved ot
God, are really of IIOUle unportance,
is indeed consolatory: but the plea-
sure thu afforded i8 much dimin-
ished h7 the ignorance still pre..

va~1ing on the subject; and which is
sufficiently evinced by your avowal of
the purpose for which you think they
are to be sought out. It is in order,
yon say, " to bring this ecattered and
peeled people, who have been meted
out and trodden down, as a pre1!8nt to
the place of the name of the Lord of
Hosts, the Mount Zion." Is this con-
llistent with the idea of Israel's having
multiplied as the sand of the sea pre-
vious to their predicted union with
Judah, as expre88ed, Hoe. i. 10, 11 ?
Ia this consistent with Ephraim's hav-
ing grown into the promised fnlnese
of nations; and, together with the
thousands of M&D&81!8h, having pushed
the people to the ends of the earth,--.
so that, at the time oftheir Restoration,
the nations shall see and be con-
founded at all their might? No, the
Lord will perform the truth to Jacob,
the mercyto Abraham, which He hath
sworn unto our fathers from the days
of old. The reoovery of Israel from
Egypt is to be eclipsed by their Re-
storation from the north country :
Were they then presented to the land
as a miserable fragment, under the
degrading patronage of their Egyptian
task-masters? Was it not in power
that they came forth, under the im-
mediate guidance and bleseing of the
God of Israel?
It is true that in IBa. xvili. the pro-
mise is given that the present of a
people aoattered and peeled shall be
brought unto the Lord of Hoste: but
look again at the last verse of that
chapter, and you will find, that thia
present is not to be brought by a mere
Gentile people: it is to be "from a
ple terrible from their beginning
~herto, wboae land the rivers have
spoiled," aa truly aa it is to be" ofa
people aoattered and peeled." And
the people terrible from their begin-
ning hitherto, are of the same stock
as the people " aoattered and peeled;"
but they are not the same portion of
the people. There is the same dis-
tinction marked in the closing verse,
aa that wluch is, throughout the Scrip-
tures, made between thecase of Israel
and Judah. The people ofwhom the
present consiBta are the Jews ; the
people from whom the present pro- •
ceeda is Israel, whose land the rivera
have spoiled: by which expression we
are led back to ch. viii. v. 7, 8, of this
same prophet, where the spoiling of
the land of Israel, as well as of Judah,
is described as commencing with the
Aseyrian invasion ; when the waters
of the river, strong and many, swept
away the house of Israel forth of their
land. The outcast house of Israel,
terrible from their beginning hitherto,
shall extend favour to the distressed,
the scattered, and peeled children of
Judah. Israel, as having renewed
their strength in the islands, and hav-
ing been brought near to their God;
and as having had the mystery of
God's working in providence, as afo111
revealed in his word, opened up to
them, shall be found in the possession
of the abundance of the seas, and
shall employ the ships of Tarshish in
this labour of love. See IBa. xJi. l.x.
&c.
You say you have read my work
without any conviction. I leave it
with your own conscience to judge of
the fact as to whether yon have really
read the book, or merelyglanced over
some particular portions. But of this
I can well judge, that you have not
paid attention to all that is contained
even in the beginning of the book;
else you could not have made some of
the statements contained in the fore-
going extract. I earnestly again re-
quest, as I did before in the preface,
that yon read the first six lectures, ·
which chiefly consist ofreasoning with
regard to the scriptural expectations
we should form, as to the so-called
lost house ofIsrael. You cannot know
whether a people be indeed the people
of the promise, until you have seen
what is really promised respecting
them. God will honour his word, by
making it the chief instrument in re-
moving the veil that hath been spread
over all nations.
You say that you believe with me
in the same hope of the restoration of
Israel, and the personal reign of our
Saviour. With regard to the latter1it is
Digitized by Coogle
·probablewe aremuchofthelalll8 mind.
·Neither ofus,however,came allat1>nee
to the conclusions at which we have
arrived on this subjeo*. Yon at fint
listened to the doctrine.ofthe perao:ll&l
reign of Chriat as unbelievingly as you
have eince regarded . our lmleliti.Bh
origin ; and I trust that it was not a
vain expectation which I have heard
expressed, that your change of opiDion
will be as complete in the one case
as in the other.
With regard to the restoration of
Israel there may yet be a oonsiderable
difference of opiDion between us, if
you look upon this as identical with
the restoration of the Jews. I eee it
promised, not that Israel, by the Gen-
tiles, shall be restored as a people
ecattered and peeled, as a kind of
minor accompaniment to the Jews ·in
their restoration. The promise is, that
Judah shall walk with Israel, when
they shall oome together out of the
north country. I see that when the
Lord shall manifest himself in fulnese
as a Father to Israel, He will declare
Ephraim to be the fim-born. I see
that the desolate woman, that was
given a bill of divorcement and sent
away, ia to have many more children
than she which remained under the
marriage covenant according to the
law-(see Is. liv.) l do not believe
that the Gentiles, merely such, will
restore Israel ; but that the Lord him-
self will do this ; and that he will be
found to have put his first-born, Eph-
raim, in a position of bleBSing the
Jews, as well as of ministering bless-
ing to all Israel, and, indeed, to the
whole family ofmankind.
The notice you take of the piety of
the writer makes me feel regret that
I do not more deserve the cherac-
ter. This, however, I can 8BY, that
what ofthe fear and love of my God I
do possess, impels me to take his word
as my guide in all such matters ; and
distinctly to avow what I receive the~
from, however I may, in so doing, have
to oppose those whom I have the
greatest cause to esteem, because of
their abundant labours in the eaul!e of
God, and because oftheir rich mRnifes-
-tation of the Spirit of my dear Lord.
-Nay, there may, in such cases, be
the greater neceseity for clearly vindi-
cating the truth ; as error is never so
.much in danger of fudng its deadly
thrall upon the meek of the earth, u
:when &BBOCiated with so much Scrip-
ture light, and Christian virtue, as in
the ·case of the honoured l!erV&nt of
God1 am now addressing
You apeak of my system as having
" so scanty.a foundation." You have
not, .however, pointed out any one
respect in which the foundation is
deficient. And this I can with con-
fidence IIBy, that there ia oot a single
mark whereby, according to the Scrip-
tures, Israel were to be known, but
:what is to be found in connection with
the people I have identified, as those
contemplated in the promiaes made
unto the fathers, the poople pointed at
by the prophets, and whom the good
Shepherd of Israel came to seek and
to so.ve: that having I'IUaed up the
tribes of Israel, he might alao. be for
salvation unto the ends of the earth.-
Is. xlix. 6.
You have llllid that my system ap-
pears to confound the distinct situa-
tion of Jew• and Gentiles.. Now it
appears to me, that you here confound
Israel with the Jews ; and bring the
former under the latter denomination:
for this you have, as far as I under-
stand it, no warrant whatever
from Scripture. - It is true, that
the Jews are a portion of Israel ; but
Israel were not, and are not Jews;
and as it was never llllid they would
become Jews, but was clearly ~
dieted, that the name of being the
Lord's people, Israel, would be taken
from them, it is clear they must be
lookedfor as bearing the uame neither
of Ill'Ml norof Judah, but of Gentiles.
It ia not until they are as the sand
of the sea-shore ; and until, in the
place they were cslled Lo-ammi, or
Gentiles, they are acknowledged u the
sons of the living GOO, that they are

apoetlee, that any Gentiles, that are
1aved during the p1'818Jlt diapentation,
are u branchee of the wild olive, in-
1181'ted among the children of Iarael,
the nat111'al. braoohee; with them, and
not to their exclusion, to partake of
the root aCid fatneu of the olive tree;
yet JOU would take from Israel their
own olive tree, and make it peculiarly
Gentile. No 8UCh peculiarity of di-
vine love do we find spoken of in
Scripture. When the Lord turned
away from tre&cheroua Judah, at the
oomm81108Ul8Ilt of the Chriatian dia-
tion, it wu after baclr.aliding
C that he lellt hie word into the
Dorth oountry. True, llrael were not

more than their father wu known to

aa being wiee in their own oonceita,
m&J have designed the bleaaing for
another; but it baa nevertheleaafallen,
aocording to the appointment of God,
upon the 10n of promise. It wu be-
canae the desolate Wom&D. wu in

evinoed auch peculiarity of divine love
in the times of the Gentiles, &I that

the Apocalypee, aa well u the great
oa&linea of Old Testament proplleoy,

ofdivine love, enabling the Lord now
to ay in truth unto outcaat Iarael,-
" Yea, I have loved thee with an ever-
luting love : therefore with loving-
ldndneaa I have drawn thee."

ont into healthy and vigorous exercise
dle several faoulties of dle human
mind, intellectual u well aa monl,
fitting this people for becoming the
leading people over all the earth. See
Lect. iii. iv.
And, when we look fartherwe ahall
l8!l that these expeotationa, formed
from the calling and history of brael,
are amply borne ont by the prophetic
word; which abundantly confirms dle
numercua promllea solemnly made
unto the fathvv: that of 1.-ael a
multitudeof nadona ahould come,who
would be at the head ofall dle people
of dle eardl; and through whom a
bleaaing woold be ministered to all
nations. We ahall - that thia pro-
phetic word points directly northward
and weatward; and, perticularly, to
these iales afar off, es bein« concerned
in the falfihnent of those promises.
We ahall aleo - that thia Ia the time
when the dlaoovery of 1.-ael may be
expected to take place. In order to
- howall thia 01111 be,we must notice

and the showing forth of hie glory.
It muat be considered that we have
to look for ltll'llel not u entirely dia-
tinot from other people. With regard
1lo the tribe of Judah, the portion of it
-which inherited tha blessing in the
days of the apostles, beeame blended
with the Gentiles: and only that por-

andwhich hadbeen prmouelymingled

We are to expectblessing for Ierael,
not ae remainiDg entirely eeparatecl

«1e with them in the Lord. God will
display hie truth in raiaing up, accord-
ing to hie promite, the iDetrument;
and then he will show hie goodneee in
the making uee of that inetrument ae

the workinge of God in proridenoe, we
llllall see hiewondrous truth and faith-
fulneee, in the fulfilment, to this time,
.<'If the prophetic word: Here, in the
north, at the termination rL the pro-
pheti.o line of empires, at the time and
ia the oiroum8tanoee predicted, do we
find a people poeeeseing all the marks
of larael. They are a people wonder-
fully dealt with and eminently bleeeed.
Their origin, and the origin of their
wiee institutions, are unaccounted for.
They oome from the eame quarter ae
.that in wbich lerael wae loet, and
·their boaeted inetitutione were the ap-
pointments of Moeee; and this eupe-
riority of intellectual and moral con-
eti\ution, ie the reeult, ae we ehall see,
of that wonderful training which Illrll81
received from their great Teacher, in
the days of old. See Lee. vii.-xii.
God's object, it may be remarked,
hae been, not to preserve perfect die-

cbjeote being accomplished, the next

mankind, both as aoting with and
towards other people. In order to thia,
they have been moat favourably p1aoed
hitherto; and they are yet to be more
favourably placed, u being given to
poeeeae that land which wae promilled
unto their fathera, a11d which, as we
ahaJl see, ie the Dl08t admirably llitu-

The Babyloman, the Peraian, the

under foot; but none of them have,
in the fulneae of the promisedbleaeing,
poeeeeaed it. The poeeeaaion ia re-
served for the people that should be

blindness in part, I know not with
what darkneea of nnderstanding you
would be l!atiafied.
But farther, you·insinuate that my
'riew does not allow ~ the "fulueea
of the elect among the Gentiles " is
now coming ·in. I suppoee you refer
to Rom. xi. 25, whil:h, however, does
'not contain the expression you nee.
Yon have·presaed the doctrine of elec-
tion into your service here, where
nothing inaid dirootly with regard to
it in the text. Tbe exprellllion ia,
" Blindness in part hath happened to
Israel nntil the fulneaa of the Gentilee
be come in." ·Now the question ia,
•hat is Dill&nt by tliia expreaaion,
" fulneaa ·of the Gentilee? " ·· And
wheli we find, from Gen. xiviii. 19~see
marginal reMing and Hehrew'ten)-
when we find that this is one of the
gteat promisee mad~ with regard to
the very people with whom I identify
the: English; who have been inti'o-
duced into _the· p6rticip&tion of ·such
bleaaing; 811 that ' the Lord hath not
dealt 80 with· any nation, we need
be a't little loss to know to what Old
Teetament propheoy the apoltle here
refers. It is not of mere Gentiles, but
of the " Fulneaa of the Gentiles" to
come of Ephraim, that the word of
God here speaks.
It remains for you to show·how the
Lord is illiO to be for ..Uvation unto
the ends of the earth, after having
raieed up the tribes of Israel, if the
trlbee of Israel are not to ·be en-
Ughtend nntil the_ fuluess of the

not to be saved nntil all the eleot of

.gether without fonndation in Scrip-
ture. No; it la of Israel he hath said,
" This people ·have I formed for my-

Ephraim, chosen of God to the plaoe
of the firat..born, and since caat 'OUt

founded· with them,· is being brought
into the Little Sanctuary, to the
Holy of Holies; which the· Lord·said
He would Hi.mself be to them ·in the
conntriesintowhich they should come.
See Ezek. xi. And Ephraim having
received bleaaing from Him thahlitteth
hetween the Cherubim,· ahall be ho-
noured·with the miriistration of bleaa-
ing unto his brethren, 80 that All Is-
rael shall be saved. And the Lord,

the ho1188 •
of ·AU Israel, will·alao be
for salvation unto theends of-the earth.
Yee; at 18ngth even the Gentiles ehall
have their eyes opened, andcome nnto
the Lord from the ends.of the ·earth,
eaying, "·Surely our fathers have in-
herited lies, vani.ty, ana things wherein
there is no profit." Such is tile order
of blessing. A portion of Israel, the
believing Jews, were made the meena
of blessing a portion of the Geatilea;
and the Roman Gentiles being made
the meena of conveying the light of
salvation unto outcast Israel, 811 be-
ing brought out into the northern wil-

apeedily be brought to say unto Him,
in the fulneaa of their h8111.1a, " My

All to other views, you say,
" There ia more reaaon to think there
ia a foundation for the opinion that
the North American lndianst~Hlf'<! ofthe
ten tn"bea, aa shown with a good deal
of apparent evidence in Mrs. Simon's
" Ten Tribes Identified."-I had exa-
mined Mrs. Simon's view long be-
fore our Israelitiah origin waa made
known to me; but, however desirous
I might be to see that at which the
word of prophecy pointed, I certainly
aaw there no fulfilment of it. There
was no evidence that they were a seed
the Lord had blessed. They were not
taking root downward, and filling the
face of the world with fruit, aa waa
predicted of Israel, whilst their own
land would be fonak.en and left like a
wilderness. Here, atleaat,Icanheartily
accord with you in saying, that " we
have nocertainty yet respecting them."
The injustice of the comparison you
have ventured to make, between such
a view and that I advocate, you will,
I trust, yet be led to acknowledge.
With regard to the remnant said to
be found by Mr. Samuel, the people
in Daghietan, on the Caspian Sea,
which you say were visited by him in
1837 and 1838, I believe there ia u
little oertainty; and supposing they
really had been visited by him, the
Editor of hia work acknowledges
that their existence, u described,
would not at all affect my argument.
As to the Neatoriana, since described
by Dr. Grant, they may indeed be
those ready to perish in the land of
:Assyria: but they cannot be the ful-
nesa of the nations to come of
Ephraim; and who were to be re-
ceived into the bleesing, not in the
countries into which they were taken,
but in thoee into which they should
af\erwards come. What you say with
regard to the remnant said to be
found, may well be said of the Nesto-
rian commllllity: " In any case this
can only be a fragment of the whole."
It remains that I notice China, with
regard to which you seem to have some
expectation. You observe that, "If
part of the ten tribes are in China, it
ia singular that both countriea, Pales-
tine and China, should, at this time
(December, 1840), be 80 remarkably
brought under the attention of Eu-
rope." China is, I believe, the last
resource of the unbelievers in our
Israelitish origin. The only p~
aa far aa I know, of Israel's having
gone into China, is very unreasonable.
It is not derived f(9m the Bible, but
from the apocryphal book of Eedraa,
where we are told, that after the ten
tribes had been taken BC1'0I8 the great
waters by the Assyrians, they resolved
to go into a farther country. And so,
passing the springe of the Euphrates,
they went a long journey of a year-
and-a-half, to go into a land wherein
never man dwelt, that they might
there serve Him wh011e service they
had so neglected in their own land.
By their being said to pass the springs
of the Euphrates, it is supposed they
went eastward. But lillY one, by
looking at the map, may see, that, u
being by the Allsyrians carried away
beyond the great waters, into the
cities of the Medea, they were already
eaatward ofthe Euphrates; and needed
not to repass it at the springs, exoept
aa passing north-westward, in the di-
rection pointed out in the following
Lectures; and whither the good Shep-
herd, who came to seek and to save
that which wu lost, hath followed
them in the whole ministration of the
Gospel; aa well u with all the bleaa-
ings of his providential goodness: 80
that he can in truth say, " I have
chosen thee, and not cut thee away."
And surely the Lord's thus accom-
plishing hia word, in leading his people
" in a way they knew not," and in, ali
length, making "darkness light before
them, and crooked things straight;"
in preserving them through so many
great and strange revolutions, malting
an end of all the nations among whom
they were ecattered, but still preserv-
ing and increasing them:-from 80
lllllall a beginning,enlarging themeven

the Lord; and that our wisdom ia to
have the mind of Chriat; and our
might ia in leaving ourselves in hia
he.nda, to be the instruments of his
good pleasure, towards the children of
men, for good unto all. Surely if God
hath been working in all these thinga
aooording to his word, although man
perceived it not-working aooordiog
to his written word, which we held in
our hauda, and yet we perceived it
not: but doubtfully regardedthia word,
as if there were no unity iD. the de-
ligna of God Eternal, nor power in
the Almighty to aooompliah that which
He had promised unto our fathers:
Surely, ifthuswehave been darkneae,
whilst the Lord hath been light about
us;-surely we shall henceforth mia-
trust ourselves: and we shall not im-
plicitly confide in any creature, how-
ever raised iD. the world, or exalted in
wisdom, or honoured even in the ce.uae
of God: but we shall say, Let the Lord
alone be exalted; God ia my refuge;
and underneath are the everlasting
anna.-Surely DOW it shall be said, aa
In X... :di. 1-3.-" 0 Lord, I will
pre.iae Thee. Though thou Wlllt
angry with me, thine anger ia turned
away, and thou oomfortedet me."
And surely We shall DOW in truth
address ourselves to the work ap-
pointed us-even the procle.imiog the
praiae of God among all the people
of Israel, as iD. v. 4, and even unto all
the earth, aa iD. v. 5. And especially
to the house of Judah, the first, who
shall be the last, but not the leaat, as
showing the salvation of Israel. V. 6.
But, alas! although God haa been
thus far 80 good, how ungrateful have
we been! We look upon the body of
Isra.e1, but aa yet we may almost say,
" No breath ia therein·" no hervest of
Israel, like to the first:fruits ofJudah,
haa as yet been enjoyed. We ere,
however, promiasd, that God shall
most assuredly aooompliah to soatter
the power ofthe holy people. He will
bring them together, and put his Spirit
within them, and deolare them to be
his people, and He will be their God.
Thia resurrection of lsre.el, e.t\er
having been lost, and buried, and soe.t-
tered, ia most justly iD. Soripture held
forth as a grand type of the resiU'l'eQo
tion of the bodies of the Individual
ee.inta, just aa the resUl'l'eCtion of the
Saviour waa a grand pledge of this re-
aurrection of Israel. And thus the
words which are In the Old Testament
used with regard to the t:esurreotiou
of Israel, are in the New applied to
the literal riaiog up of the ee.ints from
the dust of death. Compare Hoe. xiii.
14. with 1 Cor. xv. 54-57; the same
omniscience, &ithfulneae, and power,
are manifest In the one inate.nce aa In
the other. This grand subjeot of
propheoy, whichhaa &special reference
to the loving-kindness of Jehovah,
'and the spiritual life of his people
thence resulting, haa thus also a prime
reference to the two grand aupports
of thia life, the objeots of ourfaith and
of our hope:-our &ith, which looks
back to the death and the resurrection
of Jesus: who, at the same time that
he made atonement for our sins, waa
confirming the promises made of God
unto the fathers, with regard to their
natural or literal ~ whose ll&tione.l

whole body of the redeemed people
of God, to share, fully and for ever;
In the glory and bleaaedneu of our

Thia subject baa important upecta.
It ia caloulated to draw the whole
houae of Israel into love and unity
with each other, in eelf-distrpat and
mutual fOrgiven-_
; for all have beeD
blind, andyet allhave hadaome clift'er-
en' portion Ofthe truth. It ia calcu-
lated to bring them into humble and
holy effort for· the good of the whole
human race; for that, as we have aeen,
ia the purpoae for which they have
been railed up, and not for proud op-
preuive pre-eminence. Seeing that
mcih mua' be the results of this im-
portant truth respecting Israel, ean we
wonder that the subject occupies eo
overwhelming a portionof'the OldTes-
tamentScriptures? Andaeeingthatthii
aubject has not been unclerstood, can
we wonder that theae Scriptures have
beenleft incomparativeneglect? They
have been like a llllLIIB of. sentences,

no deftnite idea: and which aentenoea

in all easei, but dimly shaped out by
the varioua imaginationa ofmen. And
truly, when the Lord hath done hia
marveUoua work, even a marvelloua
work and a wonder, hewill shame all
human wisdom, and, in that day, ahall
the deaf'hear the Words of the book:
See Li. :niL 18, 19. Moat true it Ia
that the cbDtideration ofthis subject ie
neoeuary to the understanding the
great body of the Old Teatament
Scripture, which chiefly eonsiats ofde-
taila of the Lord's various training of
Israel, and prophecies reapeeting what
would be done with, and by them,

course of Providence generany, ud
of'the· tiiings ·that have happened,

and the revolutiona of empire&-the
formation of' many of' the .most im-

But, after all, there aeeme to be

perhaps, have been an embarraseing
matter to have employed theae nations
in the multiplication of Biblee, and in
the spreading them abroad among all
nations, had they been made aC-

IN CHRIST IS OUR INHERITANCE.
"BREl'BJtBlf," aaith th11 Apoatle ofthe Gentile., Gal. iii. 15-29, " I speak after
the manner of men: though it be bul a man's covenant, yet ifit be confirmed,
no m!Ul diaannuleth, or addeth thereto. Now to .Abraham and his aeed were the
promises made." In Gen. xii. 7, when Abraham was first led into the land which
he was afterwards to receive for a poueui.on, the Lord, who then gave the free
promise, said not " to seeds," as of many, but " Unto thy seed will I give this
land:" which One Seed is Christ. h is as being in Him, that the inheritauoe
can be 81\ioyed by the people;-it is as being one with Him who is the Head,
that the members of the body of Christ can be blessed as wu promised; and
the blessing in Him was freely promised to a multitudinons seed, to be brought
forth of the posterity of Joseph, and especially ofEphraim: Gen. xiviii. 15-20;
xlix. 22-26.
The covenant given upon oath unto Abraham, and confirmed tans to
Ephraim, cannot be made void: ".And this I say, that the covenant that was
confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was 430 years af\er, cannot
disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance
be of the law, it is no more oC promise; but God gave it to Abraham by pro-
mise. Wherefore, then, serveth the law? It was added becanse of transgres-
sions, till the aeed should come to whom the promise was made." The enter-
ing into that which was promised was to be by the key of David, by the fulnesa
of the Spirit's ministration,-" By angels in the hMd of a mediator,"-of that
b1eaaed Mediator in whoee right hand are the seven stars, the angels of the
churches. .All power of miniatring is Hia, who is not ouly of men, one of tlse
parties concerned in the covenant: He is also God, who is one, and will not go
back from His word, nor break the oath which He sawre unto our fathers. He
will introduce into the fulness of blessing, through the fulness of the Spirit's
ministration, received by faith. "Is the law, then, against the promises ofGod?
God forbid: for ifthere bad been a law given which could have given life, veri11
righteousness should have been by the law." But the Scripture hath concluded
all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jeans Christ might be given to them
that believe. But before that faith came (!Uld Christ is our faith) we were kept
under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,"
as He was in his first coming, and shall be much more gloriously in His second
appearing. " Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, that we
might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer
under a schoolmaster. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ
Jeaua." He ia the One Son of God, in whom the mMy sons of God are folllld
accepted. in his sight. " For as mMy of you as have been baptised into
Christ, have put on Christ." " There ia neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither
bond aor free; there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ
Jesua."
It is true, there is some difft~rence between male !Uld female as to minis-
tration in the church; just as there is between different members of the body:
so is there also between the church of the first-born Ephraim !Uld the other por-
tions of Israel, and also of the Gentiles. There are peculiar advantages bestowed
a

upon some, and, correspondent thereto, particular duties are required to be per-
formed by these, which are not eo expected from those upon whom the like
favours have not been bestowed; but none is excluded from the body, because
of his natural descent, or his earthly position. There may be a variety of
capacity, opportunity, and office, and also some difference 88 to the degrees of
rewa:rd; but there is Oneness of headship, of body, and of spirit, and we are also
called in one hope of our calling. " And if ye be Cbrist's,"-members ofthe body
of Christ, who is the Son of Abraham,-" then are ye Abraham's aeed, and
heirs acoording to the promise."
The Lord, who keepeth truth for ever, is, indeed, true to the free promise
which he made 88 to the posterity of Joseph; but when the Lord makes the
promised discovery of the long-lost children of Rachel, and of his marvellous
grace unto them, so that the nations shall know" He hath notdealt eo with any
people," then is not the stranger to say, " The Lord hath utterly separated me
from his people." In lsa. !vi. 6-8, the word of the Lord is, " Tbe eons of the
stranger that join themselves to the Lord,"-submitting to the commandment,-
" Tbou shalt have no other gods before me;" " To serve him," obeying the second
commandment, which forbids the service of images,-" And to love the name of
the Lord, to be his servants,"-being obedient thus in heart and life to the third
commandment, which forbids the taking the name of the Most High in vain;-
" Every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my
covenant,"-which points forward to the day of the Lord, when redemption
shall be completed; 88 does the fourth commandment, which also commemorates
the finishing the work of creation;-" Even them will I bring to my holy moun-
tain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt-offerings and
their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called
an house of prayer for all people. Tbe Lord God which gathereth the outcasts
of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are already
gathered." The Lord will prove faithful to the outcasts of Israel; and he will
also show kindness to the dispersed of Judah; but not exclusively to either,
or to both. He will also be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
The opening up of the Book of the Covenant W88 to be throngh the ministra-
tion of the Spirit, by the Lamb, after he had been slain, and previous to his
coming forth in kingly power to take possession of the Inheritance. Tben shall
he inherit all nations; and it shall be found that " Jacob is the lot ofhis
Inheritance."
The progress of God's great Revelation of his purposes with regard to the
promised Inheritance, especially to the 'One Seed, Christ, is given, Rev. v.
Tbe Sealing thereof to the multitudinous seed; and the recognition of the
lost children of Ephraim, who were to obtain, in Him, the birth-right blessing,
we find Jer. xxx. xxxi.
We are now come to the time when the Son of God, through the ministration
of the Spirit, W88 to open the Book of their Inheritance to the ohildren of pro-
mise, previous to his coming forth in fulnesa of power to take the dominion, and
give them possession. " He that spared not his own·Son, but delivered Him up
for us all, how aball He not, with Him, freely give us all things?" Rom. viii. 32.

THE BOOK.
REV. v. I.
" And I saw in the right band
Of Him that eat upon the throne,
A Book, wriuen wilhin and on the backside,
Sealed with eeven seals."
Hl!: who Bite upon the tl!rone is our
Faithful Creator. He created all
things ; and for his pleasure they are
and were created. He hath a right
to diapoee of all things as seemeth to
Him good; but how He does intend to
dispoee of them-and what is the al-
lotted portion of man, in the good He
intends ultimately to produce, when
creation shall so far answer the end of
its original design, as that it may be
delighted in by Him ; and how the
various workings shall oonduoe to the
bringing his great purposes into full
aooompliahment-muoh of this has
remained enveloped in mystery. He
at first formed man in innocence, and
gave him perfect enjoyment in the
Garden of Delight. In the exercise of
his sovereignty, he then gave to man
the lordslrip over the earth. All
things here were placed under his
feet. The Creator, as a token of his
superior right, reserving only one tree
in the midst of the garden. Through
the power of the tempter, inducing
the woman to deeire the posseseion of
that which the Most High had for-
bidden, man failed in his allegiance.
The crown hath fallen !'tomour head;
and woe ia unto ua, for we have Bin-
ned. Yet then a promise was made,
implying a covenant of mercy with
man, even in the Lord's pronouncing
judgment upon the eerpent, to whom
it was said, " And I will put enmity
between thee and the woman ; and
between thy seed: and her seed it shall
bruise thy head; and thou shalt bruise
G2
his heel" How this bruieing of Sa-
tan's head was to take place, and in
what it was to consist, and what was
to be the full result of the purpose
here avowed, remained, however, com-
paratively hid. Farther on, we find
the Lord entering into covenant with
Noah, and promising to man the domi
nion again of every creature on the
earth, Gen. iL 1-17. All is deli-
vered into his hand, even to the slay-
ing of the inferior animals, whilst the
life of man is not to be touched with
impunity. But although all was thus
declared to be man's, in the design of
Him who had shewn himself abund-
antly powerful to accomplish his pur-
pose, still the matter remained a mys-
tery-how the mastery,thuspromised,
was to be obtained, and what is to
be the condition of man when this end
shall be arrived at. Nor has man
ceased to shed man's blood; nor has
man replenished the earth, according
to the design of him who made it not
in vain, but formed· it to be inha-
bited. Farther on still, we find the
covenant with Abraham, with regard
to an inheritance upon the earth and
over the earth; and the heirs of the
inheritance, including himself and his
One Seed, and also his multitudinous
posterity-they being, with that One
Sel'd, made heirs of bleseing through
faith. The promise (Gen. xii. 7,)" To
thy seed will I give this land," re-
ferred, as we find, Gal. iii 16, to the
one seed, Christ, through whom, by
the power of the anointing, the ble1111-

ing was to come upon the multitudi-
nous seed : which were specially to
come, not of the tribe or house of Ju-
dah, but of the house of Isl'l\cl, and
chiefly of Ephraim. To Ephraim and
Manasseh was given the birthright
blessing, which had been given by
God, upon oath, to Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. The latter of these, and
that by faith, blessed both the sons of
Joeeph when he was dying. Yet
Abmlwn, Isaac, and Jacob, all died
without obtaining any posse88ion
of the land, which was absolutely
promised to them, as well as to their
posterity, for an everlasting posseesion.
.And the multitude of nations to come
of Ephraim have not been recognised
in the earth, although they were to
1ill the faee of the world with fruit:
.And although the one 'seed, Christ,
hath oome, he hath, to the view of
man, neither taken nor given po8861!1-
sion. As for hiDlllelf, he had not
where to lay his head ; and immecfi..
ately after his coming, the Jews were
entirely disinherited, and so remained.
Temporary possession ha.d, indeed,
been given of the land to Israel, as
Cllmiug out of Egypt, according to the
iarma of a covenant, which, as com-
pared with the covenant made with
Abraham before the law, and when he
was yet in nneir.cumcision, may be
9alled the outside Wliting of the book.
It regarded what was present and
eeen: whereas, the other ooveoant, by
which the inheritance was made sure
to all the seed, and which was appre-
hended by faith, regarded matters
more deep and remote, and far more
enduring, even everlasting:-stsnding
not in the power of man, but in the
immutable will of Jehovah, and to be
brought to pass in his own way and
in his own appointed time. .As to the
particulars of which blessing, and the
time, and way of obtaining it, there
was a constant call for faith in God,
and for patient waiting upon his own
development of his purposes. That
other possession of the land, accord-
ing to the Iaw, bas ceased through
disobedience. The house of All
I.srael have, for the predicted seven
times, or 2520 :y:ears, lost. not only all
inheritance in the land, but the very
name of being the people who were
specially chosen of God to inherit the
promises : and those of the seed of
Israel who have been allowed to re-
tain anything of the name, have been
but too visibly nuder the c~wit­
nesees among all nations of the just
judgment of God in disinheriting
them. And the justice ofthis sentence
has been nnoonaoiously witnessed to
by all nations, in the refusing them
inheritance in the conntries into which
they have wandered. Strangers in
their own country, they have been
aliens in every other. Paul, epeak-
ing on the subject of these two writ-
ings, saitb pointedly, " For the pro-
mise, that he should be the heir of the
world, was not to .Abraham or to his
seed, through the Jaw,but througla the
rightecusneas of faith." For if tltey
which are of the law be heirs, faith is
made void, and the promise made of
none effect: because the law worketla
wrath: for where no law is, there is
no transgression. Therefore it is of
faith that it might be by graoe, to the
end the promise might be 11\ll'tl to all
the seed; not to that only which is ar
the law," the Jewe, " but to that aleo
which is of the faith ofAbraham," the
other house ofIsrAel, who had lost the
law, and to whom. the Lord was te
manifest himself, as under the New
Testament dispensation, in the conn-
tries into which they were t4> come.
The precious things of the earth, and
the fulness thereof, and the good-will
of him that dwelt in the bush,-the
ble88ing in all its richness and fulness
was to come upon the head of Joseph.
and upon the crown of the head of
him that was separated from his
brethren. Thus was it written in the
Book in the right hand of Him who
sitteth on the throne; who had, by
his own right-hand workings, given
evidence of its being his ; who, by
mighty signs and wonders through
the ministration of Mosee, had abund-
antly proved that the God of Revela-
tion is the God of crelltion and of
providence. Exod. xv. 6; Is. hili. 12.

THE CHALLENGE;
·on 8TBONG ANGEL PBOCL.UiliNG.
REV. v. 2, 3.
" And I heard a strong angel proclaim-
ing with a loud voice,-
Wbo ia worthy to open the Book,
And to loose the seals thereof ?
And no man, in heaven, nor in the earth,
neither under the earth, wu able to open
the book ; neither to look thereon."'
b the case of IS1'8.el, as fonnerly in
the land, and under the law, could
have opened the Book, then surely this
might have been accomplished by So-
lomon. With his father David the
Lord had entered into a covenant
still more particular than that with
Abraham. Zion was fixed upon as
the place for the throne of the pro-
mised dominion; and the king, who
was to sit thereon for ever, was to be
of David's own family. And now a
son of David did sit upon the throne,
stretching the bounds of his empire
to the utmost extent desirable, and
powerfully inftuencing the surround-
ing states, and having, as it were, the
wealth of the world poured into his
treasury. Beloved of the Lord, and
privileged to bnild a house for his
glory, in which all Israel might wor-
ship;-above all, Solomon was pos-
sessed with a moet ardent thiret after
knowledge, combined with the moat
delicate taste and splendid imagina-
tion, and the moat consummate wis-
dom withal, to apply all his various
resources to the accomplishment of
the highest ends. IS1'8.el never knew
any such possession of power or glory
in the land; nor had they ever among
them, when together in the land, a
man who could so understand a pro-
verb and the interpretation ; the words
of the wise, and their dark sayings:
And from the book of Proverbs we
find that he early felt it hill pri-
vilege, as well as duty, constantly to
search for wisdom and understanding.
At the same time we find, from the
Song ofSongs, that he could also enter
into the deep mystery of the Bride-
groom and Bride, as expre88ing the
affections with the greatest tender-
ness and warmth: and yet, after all
this depth of understanding and ar-
dency of affection, his book of Eccle-
siastes may be taken as a most ex- .
pressive expansion of the result stated
of the challenge in the text. He had
himselfattempted, in all possible ways,
to open the Book, and he could not.
After all his various searching, we
find him only at the beginning. " Lo,"
said he (vii. 29), " this only have I
found, that God made man upright;
but they have sought out many inven-
tions." And again, viii.l6, 17," When
I applied mine heart to know wisdom,
and to see the business that is done
upon the earth: (for also there is that
neither day nor night seeth sleep with
his eyes:) then I beheld all the works
of God, that a man cannot find out
the work that is done under the sun;
because, though a man labour to seek
it out, yet he slui.ll not find it. Yea,
farther; though a wise man think to
know it, yet shall he not be able to
find it." " No man was able to open
the Book, neither to look thereon."
Thus said the preacher: and yet he
" was wise, and still taught the people
knowledge ; yea, he gave good heed,
and sought out, and setin order many
proverbs. The preacher sought to
find out words of delight, and that
which was written was upright, even
words of truth." Thus does he ac-
knowledge the writing to be beauti-
fnl and true, although the depth of it
could not, at that tinie, be found out;
and although he states the principle
according to which the mystery was
to be evolved :--even viewing no word
of prophecy apart, but as part of one
great whole, given forth through dif-
ferent instrumentalities, who spake as
moved by the Spirit of God: so it is
said, Eccles. xii. 11, " The words of
the wise are as goads, and as nails
fastened by the masters ofassemblies,

which are given from one shepherd."
And he plainly intimates that, in the
neglect of this rnle, a v1111t deal would
be written to comparatively little
ptll'pOie, v. 12. "And, further, By
these, my son, be admonished : of
making many books there is no end;
and much study is a weariness of the
flesh." And he knew also the con-
clusion of the whole matter, " Fear
God,~ in which is the beginning of
wisdom, " and keep his command-
ments," which is the end of all re-
vealing. And that all would ulti-
mately be brought to light he knew:
" For God shall bring every work into
judgment, with every secret thing,
whether it be good, or whether it be
evil." And, that men might be fully
prepared for this, the secrets of his
word were to be uncovered ; and,
thereby, his wondrous working in
providence and redeeming love.
In the days of Solomon there w1111
but a typical and very imperfect ful-

vince him that the fulfilment wu yet
to come~ He had " seen all the works
that were done under the sun : and,
behold, all Willi vanity and vexation
oC spirit." That which Willi crooked
could not be made straight, and that
which wuwanting could not be num-
bered. It ia the wise man that ia
strong, and Solomon Willi the wisest of
men; and, in the very commencement
of the book referred to, he calla him-
self the preacher, or proclaimer. He
'Willi, indeed, a strong angel, proclaim-
ing, with a loud voice, the vanity of
all human attempts to open the book.
Thus be gives the result of his obser-
vations upon all the trials, not ouly
oCothers, butofhis own greatstrength:
"Vanity of vanities,eaith the preacher,
orproclaimer,-vanityofvanities;-all
isvanity:" And if such wu the voice
in the days of the preacher, how much
more 80 when, upon his death, the
throne oC his kingdom Willi bereaved
ofthe greatbodyofthe people--ofthat
portion which is, indeed, called " All
181'1181," or " the Whole House oC Is-
rael; n and eapecially oC the children
oC Joseph, unto whom belonged the
promises made unto the fathers re-
specting the multitudinous seed, just
1111 to Judah belonged the promise re-
specting the One Seed that should in-
herit the kingdom, and reign over the
tn"bes ofJacob. And 1111 the people of
the promise were lost, 80 Willi the fa..
mily unto whom·the promise had been
given respecting the kingdom. They
had no power to reign after the cap-
tivity in Babylon: thereafter that fa..
mily appears to have sunk into utter
obecurity. The Maccabees, who had
kingly power for a little, were oC the
tribe oC Levi; and Herod, he who
reigned when the promised son of
David appeared, Willi a son oC Edom;
from whose destructive power the
true Heir but nerrowly escaped with
his life; and whose kinsman held his
claims in sovereign oontempt, and
joined with Pilate in delivering him
over unto death.

deed, be richly taught therein. The
prophets, to whose development of the
DivineWill wehavenow come,searehed
diligently to know of the treasnres
that word contained; and he who, of
Christ's disciples, was the nearest to
his boi!Om when upon earth, and to
whom the boi!Om ofhis Lord was most
open from heaven, wept much,because
the contents of the Book ofthe Inheri-
tance, were withheld from his view;
and, for ourencouragement in search-
ing to see the riches of tha.t salvation
which was ready to be revealed in the
last time, we are given to see tha.t he
wept not in vain. " Weep not," said
one of the elders, not as comforting
the disciple in hisignorance, or as tell-
ing him tha.t he might more profitably
turn his attention to something of a
more practical natnre: sowouldmany
who are wise in the things of this
world have directed; but far be such
apathy from the beloved disciple of
Jesus. Jesus can teach as never man
taught. For inhim are hid allthe trea-
sures of wisdom and knowledge; He
can lead into the rich unfolding of the
mystery ofGod; He is the Lion of the
tribe of Judah (praise), who gives the
key-note to the choirs of heaven,
when, with Judah's mother, each saint
shall say, upon beholding their inhe-
ritance through grace in glory, " Now
will I praise the Lord." He it is of
whom his father said, " Judah, thou
art he whom thy brethren shall praise.
Thy hand shall be in the neck at
thine enemies; thy father's children
shall bow down before thee." And,
contemplating his progress in leading
into the Inheritance, he spak.e of him
in his first appearance as the " Lion's
whelp;" then of his ascension as hav-
ing spoiled principalities and powers,
making a show of them openly in his
oross, " From the prey, my son, thou
art gone up." Then ofhis long suffer-
ing during the past triumphing of the
wicked, and of his futnre springing
upon the prey, when he shall clear his
inheritance of the spoiler, and take
full possession for his people. " He
stoopeddown; heoouchedasalion,and
asanoldlion; whoshallronsehimnpP"
He also is the Root of David; first ap-
pearing as a root, or spront, out ar a
dry ground; and at that time despised
ofthe people; but afterwards he shall
" stand for an ensign of the people: to
it shall the nations seek, and his rest
shall be glorious." He shall lead the
people into the inheritance, and give
them therein to rest.
As it was when the kingdom of Is-
rael was in its greatest strength, as in
the days of Solomon, tha.t the crea-
tnre's inability to discover the con-
tents of the Book was most thoroughly
expressed, so it was when tha.t king-
dom was in its weakest state, as in the
days of the prophets, tha.t the Creator
began most clearly to present himself·
as powerful to reveal. Then we find,
tha.t when the kingdom was divided,
and fast hastening to decay, we
have the words from Isaiah, " Com-
fort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith
yonr God. Speak ye comfortably to
Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
warfare is accomplished, that her ini-
quity is pardoned: for she hath re-
ceived of the Lord's hand double for
all her sins." The double portion,
the birthright blessing, the Book of
inheritance in the Lord's right hand,
is hers, notwithstanding all her un-
worthiness. Then perish all the folly
of man before the bright revelation of
the wisdom of God! "The grass
withereth, the flower fadeth, because
the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon
it: surely the people is grass. The
grass withereth, the flower fadeth:
but the word of our God shall stand
for ever." Isaiah, elsewhere, eh. :xxx.
v. 19, speaks of a time when He will
be very gracious unto those who, like
John, wait for him. " Thou shalt
weep no more. He will be very grs-
cious unto thee at the voice of thy
cry. When he shall hear it, he will
answer thee. " And although still the
bread of adversity may be given, and
water of afBiction, yet shall not thy
teachersbe removed into a comer any
more ; but thine eyes shall see thy \
teachers." The Book shall be opened,
and the inheritance shall be betltowed ·.'

v. 23-25, and aleo aa ~the hea'V8Dly

abundantly witness to his truth, both
~ mercy and in judgment, v. 27--33.
Another prophet, Jeremiah, in ch.
lCCili. gives us the m011t lively repre-
aentation of t.hia our kinsman Re-
d,eemer purchaaing the possession that
seemed irremediably los~ lost, aa
that the prophet, with the liveliest re-
membranoe of the manifestations of
the Lord's past goodne88 and power of
red~, seema struck with aato-
nishment at the transaction he then
went througjl. by divine appointment.
After he had made the purohaae to
which he had been directed, he
took the sealed and. open evidenoe of
the purohaae. and gave them to Ba-
ruch (Blessing), the son of Neriah
(Lamp of the Lord). Then we find
the pl'OPhet pouring out his soul be-
fore the Lord, acknowledging that he
wu still in the da.J;k aa to how all this
oould be accomplished: and the Lord
answers, oalling for simple faith in
him, aa to how he would accomplish
his word of promise. It ia He who
sitteth upon the throne who speaks,
" Behold I am the Lord, the God of
all lleeh. ls there anything too hard
for me? " He then prooeede to recog-
niee the obatacles to the taking pos-
eession, and giving to the people the
1)rOIIlieed Inheritanoe : their not ac-
knowledging hiJD. aa their teacher and
their King: yet, after all, he goes on
tD deliver the promisea reepecting the
everlaating covenant, to be eecured to
them through the priesthood of Christ,
according.to which he would rejoice
over them, to do them good, and would
plant them in that veryland111811redly,
with his whole heart and his whole
souL And, in ch. xxxiii, referring
still, it would seem, to this Book of the
everlasting covenant, eecuring to the
people of prqmiee the Inheritance,
through their kinsman Redeemer, he
says, " Thus saith the Lord, the
Maker thereof, The Lord that formed
it, to establish it ; the LoBD," the
everlasting Jehovah, ia " hia name.
Oal,l. unto me, and I will answer
tlf.ee; and show theegreatandmighty
things wllich thou knoweet not." It
ia HE that can open the Book. Then,
having again pointed out the oauee of
his having .Qeen a lion to the houee of
Judah, he prooeeda to point forward
to the time when, upon the restoration
of Judah and of l.arael, he would
find the former houee worthy of their
name, v. 10, 11. Again shall be heard
~the now desolate cities of Judah
and streete of Jerusalem, " The voioe
of joy, and the voioe ofgladneM; the
voioe ofthe bridegroom, and the voice
of the bride; the voice of them that
shall say, Praiee the Lord of Hoete:
for the Lord ia good; for ~s meroy
endureth for ever: and of them that
shall bring the sacriftoe of praise into
the houee of the Lord." And the
Lord there also promises that the sight
ofthat perfect peaoe, prophesied in the
name Jerusalem, shall be accompanied.
by outward temporal peaoe, such aa
yet remained to be enjoyed in the
land. Then, in v. 16-26, he shews
how all this blessing waa to be looked
for in oounection with the Root of
David. It is in the restoration. of both
Israel and Judah, and in the days of
the Branch of Rightecnsness : after
which David shall never want a man
to sit upon the throne of Israel, that
he will perform that good thing he
had promised unto the houee of lsrael
and the houee of Judah: and he aa-
B'9fe& ns that his covenant with David
his eervant, 1111 to the having a Son to
sit upon his throne for ever, ia 1111
firmly established aa his covenant of
the day and of the night; and as the
host of heaven cannot be numbered, so
will he multiply the eeed of David his
eervant. And, finally, 1111 it hath b!len
said, " The two families which the
Lord hath choeen,sohe hatheven cut
them off:" he gives the aasured word
, of oomfort, " If my covenant be not
with day and night, and if I have not
appointed the ordinances of heaven
and eerth:" (ifhe i& not the Creator of
all, then will he not be the Redeemer
of Israel:) " then will I cast away all

As it wu when Israel was in the
sinmgelt state that the inability of the
ereatnre co open the Book was the
m<IK strongly declared, 10 it wu when
the kingdom was reduced to the
we&kest condition; when the children
of Joeeph, the heira of the prom~
were removed far away; &Dd when
Raebe1 wept for her ohildreu, &Dd re-
fueed co be comforted beeauee they
were not; and when of Zion it was
Mid, " Sbe weepeth sore in the night;
&Del her tear. are on her cheeks :
among all her Ioven abe hath none CO

the throne of D&vid, which wae to be
fer ever,it was being eaid, "Write dlia
maa ohildl-; a maa that sbalJ. not
pnllper in his days: for no man ofhis
aeed sbalJ. Jli"'OIPttl", sitting npon the
tllrone of D&vid, or ruling any more
in Judah"-then it was that through
the weeping prophet the words were
spoken, " Thua eaith the Lord, Re-
frain thy voioe from weeping, and thine
eyes from tears: for thy work llllall
be rewarded,eaith the Lord. And there
ia liepe in thine end, eaith the Lord,
"tha& tlry children aball come again to
tJaeir own border." And in the very
oeDtre othia lamentations over the de-
eolationa of Zion we find the words,
eh. iii. 81-33, " The Lord will not
out ofFforever; but though he oauee
grief, yet will he have oompuaion ac-
cording to the multitude of hie mer-
eiel: for he doth not dliot willingly,
nor grilrrethe children of men." And
immediately after that denunciation
upon the King of Judah we find the
promile ofthe RootofD&vid, Jer. :aiii.
5, 6, referred to ,by the elder, "Be-
hold the days come, aaith the Lord,

THE OVERCOMER.
Rav.v. 61 7.
" And I beheld, 1111d lo, in the midst of
the tbroae, &Dd of the four HYingcre&IIU'e8,
lllld in the midst of the elden, stood a
Lamb .. it had been liain, ha-rillg le'feD
homa and ,...._ e,-ea, which are the -
Yen spirits of God, 8811t forth IIllO all the
eanh. And be came aDd took the book
OQ\ of lbe risb1 haDd of him 1hai& 1111. upon
the throne."
A LIOlf had been spoken of, but here
we behold a Lamb, and that aa it had
been a1ain; for thua muat the Inhe-
, ritanee be redeemed ; and thus muat
the people be redeemed for the Inhe-
ritance: even with the precious blood
of Christ, aa of a Lamb without ble-
miah and without spot. Thus muA
the Redeemer of Israel be presented
before the throne in glory. He had
been a1ain, but now he stands in re-
IU.l'reOtion life; and is alive for ever
more, and is received up intopower in
the midat of the throne, the -giver ot
all life, 1111d director of all instrumen-
• tality. He hath, indeed, fulnese of
power,represented'by the seven horns;
and fulnese ofwisdom or intelligence,
having seven eyes, which are the se-
ven spirits of God, sent forth into all
the earth. They ll1ll"''ey the work-
ing of provillence in every part there-
of, in aooompliabment of the predic-
tions of prophecy, with which the
Book of the Inheritance is sealed; and
without an attention to the fulfilment
thereof, the seals cannot be opened.
At the time of the end, till which the
book waa to be sealed, it is intimated

that many would ron to and fro, and
knowledge should be increaeed : and
this increaae of knowledge the Spirit
of God can render available both for
the increaae of light u to the word of
revelation, &Ud for the dissemin&tion
thereof in the world around : unto
which the Spirit shall be sent, when,
in the abundant latter rain, it shall be
poured out upon all flesh-sent forth
into all the earth, in the fulness of
spiritual gifts, which shall be given in
connection with the opening of the
prophetic word.
The right hand of Jesus is that
which can meet the Father's right
hand. In the hand of the Father is
the seven-sealed Book, the most wise
and powerful attestation to the truth
of his everluting covenant : and,
answerablP thereto, there &re in the
right hand of the Son the seven stars,
the key of David, that which opens to
the Beloved; the perfection of powpr
and of wisdom, to interpret all revela-
tion of the Father's will to man. " No
man knoweth the Father but the Son,
and he to whom the Son shall reveal
him." It is Jesus, who, by the mani-
festation of his fulness of love, opens
the hearte of his people to be filled
with the manifold wisdom of God.
He giveth them the key of the Be-
loved to unlock the treasures of the
everluting covenant of the Father.
·Thus have those who have been pe-
ouliarly favoured with the revelation
ofthe wisdom of God had the name of
David, Beloved. Thus wu called Da-
vid; thus Solomon was called also Je-
didiah, Beloved of the Lord. Thus
wu Danielcalled, "0 man greatlybe-
loved ;" and thus wu John himself
called the Beloved Disciple." It is
love which unlocks the heart both of
God and man. We shut up ourcoun-
sels from those we 8U8p8Ct; but we
unfold freely our intentioD& to our be-
lovedfriends, and invite them to a full
participation ofall the good we enjoy.
It may be observed that, as the first
presentation of the Book, as written
withinandonthebackside,wasthrough
the instrumentality of Mosss, when
the Creator eo marvellously attested
the book, as being from him, by his
mighty power-by his right hand
working, both in judgment upon the
oppreseor and for meroy to the op-
pressed-leading these as by the right
hand through the waters of the Red
Sea, and through the buming and
barren desert, commanding all the
powers of nature to witness to the
truth of his word: wQich word had
both the writing inside, as to the free
promises made to the fathers before
the law; and aleo the outside writing
as to the ceremonial Jaw, aocording to
which the present temporal possession
of the land was given, until the pro-
mised eeed should come, unto whom
were made the pl'ODiia M>ntained in
the inside writing of the Book.-
And, as the preaching or proClaim-
ing ofthe stroug angel, referred to the
next great bestowment of revelation,
wu by David, and eapecially by·Solo-
mon, who seemed, indeed, to have all
tb.e riches of the temporal possession
given to him, yet withal most loudly
expressed, as w.e have seen in Eccle-
siastes, the inability of any creature to
open the book of the Creator's pur-
poees as to the promised good.-
And as the comfort to thos who
searohed diligently with eyes be-
dimmed with tears, to know the mind
of God in his word, took place when
wu given the third great addition to
the word of Revelation by the three
greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Ezekiel,u well as bythe other twelve,
and Daniel the man greatlybeloved-
So was it in the fourth great giving
of the word in the New Teetament;
there was especially eeen that to
which we a.re now come; the union or·
the divine with the human nature in
the pereon ofChrist. .A.being man, he
wu the Lamb as it had been slain,
typified by the outaide writing of the
Book; but as God he had the fulness
of divine power, repreeented by the
seven horns; and theperfectionoftbe
omniscient Jehovah, expressed by the
seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God
sent forth into all the earth. He was,
in truth, the Son of David aooording
to the flesh, but declared to be the

Son of God with power (the aeven
horns), IWlCOrding to the Spirit of ho-
lineas (the seven eyes): declared thus
to be the Son of God by the l"'lS11l''''O-
tion from the dead. Upon his resur-
rection, the Holy Spirit was given to
qualify for their office those that were
sent to be:witnessea of his returreetion,
in Judea and Samaria, and unto the
uttermost ends of the earth. They
preached that which, to the Jew, did
not appear power, but a stumbling-
block; and to the GTeek not wisdom,
but fooliahnesa : but which ia yet, to
every one that believeth, the power of
God, and the wisdom of God. It is
the evidence that the right hand of
Chriat hath _.the right hand of the
Father, and received the token of
sovereignty ; and ia, indeed, made
Lord and Chriat: and hath now only
to ask, and the nations shall be given
him for his inheritance, and the utter-
moat parts of the earth for his po8888-
Bion: to witness of whose right and
coming to reign the heralds were sent
forth to work miracles, in attestation
of the truth received from Him who
Bitteth upon the throne; and to open
np the mysteries of the kingdom given
forth by Him who liveth for ever and
ever. The outside writing of the
Bookwas then read in the deciphering
the shadows of the ceremonial law;
but the apo&tles themselves speak
of the opening of the book as still
future. It was then ready to be re-
vealed in the last time, when that
which was perfect wonld be come, and
that which ia in pan, wonld be done
away.

was to be given, beside the witnessing
of the apostles, lee John xv. 26, 27.

The mysteries of the kingdom are
in hie hand as the Interpreter ; and
they can only be ufe in our bande by
our being in hie;-simply depending
upoo hie enlightening, as upon hie en-
livening, power. We must neither de-
pend upon our own understanding,
DGr lllaviably look to the creature for
guidanoe; but have ever our minde
open towards Him for inetruction in
all the revealed will of God. The
Father bath given the Book to Him
to shew unto his eervanta the things
that must shortly oome to pass; He,
not only as the Fountain of all know-
ledge, knows bow to instruct, but
tlftn by experienoe he knows the ne-
cessities of onr D&ture, that require to
be supplied out of hie own fulness:
and he bas also, by experienoe, the
knowledge of how to communicate
the instruction n-..zy; whether it
be at the marriage feast, or the fune-
ral; by the -.aide, or on the moun-
tain top; in the lowly village, or the
crowded city; tothe commonpeople by
day, or to the ruler of the people by
night. He knows how to make all
matters and all circumstances"at all
times subservient to useful instruc-
tion,soas that everypower ofthemind,
and every feeling of the heart, may be
filled with divine light &nd love. He
knows the mind of God and the mind
ofman, and can bring them into unity.
He, our greet Teacher, ia indeed
worthy to take the Book. He ehall
181ld the Spirit, in the fulness pro-
miled, to lead into all truth, that his
bride may be fully arrayed for hie
glorious appearing.
He ia also worthy to open the ..Is
thereof,-to exercise power in his of..
1iee as King,-opening the title-deeds
to the purchasedp<l88881ion,and claim-
ing, as rightful Heir and Lord, all that
appertains to the Inheritanoe. The
'opening of the ..Is, as we shall at\er-
warda find, are llllOC&II8ive seta of
authority, in reaching forward to the
obtainment of that, which, as King, be
aha1l reign over: and these aeta of
authority are in the exercise of regal
power, both for judgment and for
mercy. Christ knows best bow to ex-
erciae both: for not only bas he infi-
nite wisdom to direct his almighty
power, but as man be knows by ex-
perienoe both what it ia to obey wil-
lingly that whicb is just and right,
and what it is to suft'er wrongfully.
He knows how laws affect the happi-
ness of the an1Uect ; whether those
laws are aooording to jnstioe and
mercy, or the reverse. He knows the
temptations and the trials of the poor
andneedy: He carefully sympathises
with them in all the circumstanoes of
life, even unto the death; and may,
therefore, be expected to exercise hie
power, both for the honour of the law-
giver, and the blesaing of the nations.
Thus did he qualifYhimself for the
prophetic and kingly offices, and that
by becoming our priest : " For thou
wast slain, and hast redeemed us to
God by thy blood." This is onr
kinsman Redeemer-fur which be re-
quired to be God, to have of his own
wherewith topaythe redemptionprioe:
for no mere man can redeem hie bro-
ther from death; yet he, our Brother,
bas so redeemed us: he being more
than our brother, even God with us.
But, as God, he bad not a body ofthe
nature which had sinned, in which the
punishment for sin might be endured:
and so, taking to him a human body,
and a reasonable soul, he llllid, " Lo I
come: in the volume of the book it is
written of me, to do thy will, 0 God."
And as be was man to lllllfer, so is he
man to plead, in a full sympathy with
our nature, and knowledge of our
wan~t the same time that he is of
the same nature with the Father, to
give value to his intercession in Hea-
ven. He bath omniscience to discern
between the prayer ot the sinoere in
heart, and the mockery of God by
the hypocrite. He knows what re-
quests may best be answered, and
which refused: how to present man
before God, and how to get the fnluess
of God conveyed into the sonl of
man.
The blessings $he sainte enjoy
through these three oftioes of Christ
are also three, and are immediately
al\er adverted to in an inverse order.

Thus, through ·his prieethood we are
justifie!l, and adopted into the family
ofGod. We are redeemed to God by
his blood,-through the blood of his
&toning sacrifice we are justified, and
brought near unto God 88 our Father.
We no longer feel ourselves in the
distinction of kindred, or tongue, or
people, or nation, so 88 to live in alie-
nation from each other 88 heretofore.
We feel that the bond which connects
uaiastronger than anythingthat would
separate. This through the relation
into which we are brought by our re-
deeming Brother, to our FathAr in
Heaven. This ia the blessing of faith
through his blood.
So have we towards Him as our
.King, submission to his royal law of
love, and holy devotedness to his
blessed service; and so it ia here said,
" And bast made us unto our God
kings and priests." This is through
.the sanctification ofthe Spirit,whereby
we are made to devote ourselves to the
doing the will of God, 88 our God:-a
God whom we love and delight to
*'"e; and, in thia devotedne111, there
ia an acting according to the law of
the kingdom, so that we exerciee
power 88 kings, and mercy as priests,
together with him, in bannony one
with another, one divine will regulat-
ing all. And so also do the saints, in
their high appointment by God, feel
elevated above the degrading service
of the world, and the slavery of. Sa..
tan, to a most holy dignity; for power
to act in which, they are now called
to evince their obedience, by a patient
waiting in continuous well doing.
So have we,towards Chriat as a pro-
phet, hope of the good to be enjoyed
in the ooming kingdom, according to
the good purpose of the Father re-
vealed by Him; with regud to which,
the song of the aaints concludes,
" And we shall reign on the earth."
They bad kno:wn that they were to be
kings and priests unto God; but now
their expectations take a definite
shape; and the scene of their occupa-
tion of these offices lies before them.
.It is " on the earth; " Yet not of thia
world ia the kingdom, but in the world
to come.-Not in thia llfe, for ileab
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God; neither can corruption in-
herit incorruption,-the inCOITUptl"ble
City, that cometh down out of heaven
from God, and whioh shall be the pe-
culiar abode of the glorified saints,
whose kingdom shallbe over the whole
earth, under the whole heaven. They
shall have dominion over the nation•;
and aball, 88 priests, have the su-
preme felicity of miniatring blessing
to all the inhabitants of tbe earth,
when the Prince of the kings of the
earth aball sit as a Priest upon bia
throne : for so hath the great Prophet
revealed.

SONG OF THE ANGELS.
REv. v. 11, 12.
" And I beheld, and I heard the voiee
of many angels round about the throne,
and the Hving creatures, and the eldets;
and the number of them was ten thoulland
times ten thOUS!Uld, 8l1d thoUiaDcla of
thousands, saying, Worthy ia the Lamb
thatwaaslain,-
1. To reoeh·e power,
2. And riches,
8 And wisdom,
4. And strength,
6. And honour,
6. And glory,
7. And bleliSing."
TJD: seven Spirits bad been sent forth
into alJ the earth ; and the sons of
God, thereat\er, andthereby, bad been
gathered out of all nations, to present
their united prayers before the Lamb:
acknowledging that the right of re-
demption is his, and nUoicing in the
proapeot of entering with him into the
poeaession ofthe Inheritance,the Book
of which he hath received out of the
Father's right hand. Tbe poaaesaion
ofthe earth, and full dominion over all
that it contains, bad been given to
Adam, and loat through bia fall; but

now the redemption price hath been
paid, both for the people and their lost
~n; and now He, our kinsman
Redeemer, hath been called upon to
claim hia own. This is the time to
which we are now approsching, when
the prayera of the people of the Lord
ahallaacend up, like the incenee from
golden vials, for the Redeemer to take
poeaeaaion. And he ahall oome when
thus called for. " For this will he be
inquired of by the house of Israel to
do it for them." When the whole
church ehall ih earneat cry," Come,
Lord Jetus, come quickly," the Bride-
groom ehall appear: and then ehall
that other ecene be revealed, referred
•to in the text. When the Lord cometh,
he oomea with his mighty angels--
with all his holy angelt-illl innumer-
able company of angels, who take
their stand around the throne ofGod,
the Son of God, and the many eons
he has led into glory,-etill repre-
eented as the four living creaturee,
and twenty-foureldera: for the church
hath, in the Lamb slain from the foun-
dation of the world, been from the be-
ginning viewed as one and complete.
Now, however, they are indeed com-
plete, when the eceoe occurs which is
here detcribed. They are not only
brought back into their.Father's pre-
eence through grace, but led up be-
fore his -t in glory. The angela
have been eent with the great eound
of a trumpet to gather the redeemed
from the four winda of heaven, and
now they are gathered. The number
of the elect is aocompliahed, and theee
have taken their places in their house
which ie from heaven, and the hea-
venly attendants are around them,
rejoicing in their felicity, and in the
glory, which, through suffering obe-
dience, they have brought unto Him
who is exalted far above all principa-
litiea and powera in heavenly glory;
and who yet had cetldeecended to take
the place of the kinsman Redeemer
for them. Upon man's creation the
morning &tara se.ug together; but now
they sing a nobler eong,-a aoug in
which the glory of even the creation
ia, ae it were, lost sight ot; in the glory
of redeeming love. The aaints had
been singing, aa it were, a new eoug
in the prospect offurther eervice upon
earth; but now, when raised into that
glory, which eye hath not aeen, nor
heartofmanconceived,andwhen them-
eelveeareeerved by the angelsin glory,
their eong Is hushed into mute aato-
nishment, whilst they listen to that
which ear hath not heard, in the
united burat of praise unto the Lamb,
from the innumerable company of
angela around them.
The angels, in number ten thousand
times ten thousand, and thousanda of
thousands, gladly respond to the eong
of the sainta, in praising redeeming
love, which, although their unfallen
condition has not required for them-
selves, they can yet rejoice in for the
bride, the Lamb's wife, nnto whom
they are all ministering spirits. And
contemplating how He left; the glory
of his Father for the form of a ser-
vant, that he might redeem his people
from death, and give them to sit with
him on histhrone;-and how,although
He was rich, yet for our sakes he be-
came poor, that through his poverty
we might be made rich; and how He
who was wisdom was willing to be ac-
counted aa a fool, yea, and mad for us,
that we might be made wise unto sal-
vation; and how He, who beareth up
the pillara of oreation, allowed him-
self, aa withoutstrength,tobestretched
upon the Ol'OIS, that he might be unto
us a strong, yea, a sure foundation;--
how He, the fount of all honour, was
rejected and despised ofmen, and this
that the saints, from the dehaaement
of earth, might be lifted up to the
honour of being kings and priests in
the kingdom oftheir Father; and how
he, the Lord of glory, allowed himself
to be covered with shame and spitting,
that we might be brought into that
exceeding weight of glory, amid the
angela in heaven, to abide there for
ever aa the eons and daughtera of God
Almighty-Finally, aeeing how He,
the Bleseed One, became a curse for
man; and how blessing now descends
upon the whole redeemed creation,
delivered from the bondage of eorrnp-

80D8 of God ; who, having supreme
control, gives free BOOpe to all the
powers of nature folly to develope
themselves in all the forms of bleB&-
ing:-thus contemplating the I!&Ol'iDee
made by ChriJt from the beginning,
they give the power of the throne
from whieh he descended, the riehea
of the kingdom of181'11el He hath pur-
ehaaed, the wiadom of contrivance
with regard to preparing a people for
his name, and leading them into the
purchased poaaessi.on, the strength for
aeeomplishing the deliverance thus
planned, the honour of the many
crowns proemed for those who shall
be kings and. prieats unto God, the
glory in heaven into which themaelYes
have introdneed these heirs of salva-
tion,and all bles&ing upon earth, upon
which the heaven is now opened in an
abundant bestowment of good-AU
they give unto the Lamb that was ·
slain.
It is now, indeed, made manifest,
that the Most High doth feel with and
for the creature; and the creature has
been led into the mind of the Most
High, and all through the union of the
divine and human nature& in the per-
IOD of Chrilt Jesus, and by him in his
exercise of the three great offices of
prophet, king, and priest: justifying
us through faith, sanctifying us by his
holy love, and enlightening us 10 as
to apprehend the joyful object of hojle
set before us. Therefore unto him
be supreme power to poesesa the riches
of the Inheritance, to nee, 11000rding
to his strength of salvation, his 88inta,
in the honour into which be hath
raised them, the angels in the glory
he hath spread out before them: and
every obedient creature in the bles&ing
wherewith he hath blessed them.
Thus do the angela desire to look into
these things; how much more should
we, whose eternal interests are more
deeply involved in the matter of this
brief, but most expressive, 10ugI

BLESSING FROM EVERY
CREATURE TO GOD AND THE
LAMB.
RJ:v. v. 13, 14.
" And every creature which is in Heaven,
And on the earth, and under the earth,
And such as are in the sea,
And all that are in them, heard laaying,
Blessing,andhononr,and glory,and power,
Unto Him that oitteth upon the throae,
And unto the Lamb, for eYer and ever.
And the four living creatures said Amen,
And the four and twenty elders fell down,
And worahipped Him that liveth for ever
and ever."
THE song having been begun by the
88inta upon eanh, and continued as
they asoend under the conduct of the
angels ; and that 10ng having been
anawered by the angels, as having ao-
eomplished thatservieeforthe bride-
these take their stand before their
Lord, &lid around the redeemed f&mily
in heaven, and joyfully give Him the
glory ofall that work of grace, which,
as under his command, they have just
oompleted. The BOng being thus sung,
upon the heaven and the 8IU'th meet-
ing each other in the glory of the New
Jerusalem, that then shall descend,
to receive within ita pearly gates those
that have been prepared to aaeend,
and to see " the King in his beauty;"
and to behold the earth, as afar. oft',
spread ont beneath their feet in the
enjoyment of righteousneu and peace,
where the nations of the saved disport
themselves amid aeenes of the love-
liest beauty and richest fruitfulness;
surveying all with intelligence, and
looking upon all with hearts full ofin-
noeen91' and love, now is heard the
earth answering to the heavens ; yea,
every creature is heard taking part in
the song, and answering to each other;
whether it be in heaven, or on the
eanh, immediately beneath the glory,
or under the earth, on the reverse side
of the globe, or ou the sea which lieth

between-ye&, all that &re in them,
are heard ascribing the blessing they
enjoy, through the ministration of
thOfle who have over them been made
kings and priel!ts ; and the honour of
that salvation into which these have
been exalted over the earth ; and the
glory which theee &re given to enjoy
amid innumerable angels in their Fa-
ther's house in heaven; and the power
of the throne before which these wor-
ship, and in the midst of which these
are,-all they gladly give unto the
Creator and Redeemer.-" Unto him
that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb for ever and ever." And
the fOur living creatures, who &re
given abiding life in him that liveth
for ever and ever, give their glad
Amen; and the four and twenty el-
ders, through whom the blessing has
been ministered to the nations, are
hleseed in ascribing all to Him whose
eternal purposes have resulted in the
full feast ofjoy to the whole creation
of God-they " fall down and wor-
ship Him that liveth for ever and
ever."
It is remarkable that this descrip-
tion of the service of the Lamb, in
order to prep&re this feast for all
people ; ye&, for heaven and earth,
and of which the Lord himself as
man will partake, oonaists of seven
parts, correspondent in order with the
names of the seven who were first
chosen toworldlyservice inthe church,
Acts, ch. vi. 5. Thus Stephen (the
Crcmm) characterizes the opening of
the vision, which is with the presenta-
tion of the Book, giving a right to the
crown, or lordship, to him that can
prevail or obtain the crown of victory, •
as brnising the head of Sstan who had
usurped the dominion. Then Philip,
which is LOfJer of tAe Hor.e, or one
ready &lid able for service, refers to
the proclamation of the strong angel
for one able to accomplish this high
service for God and for man. Then
the third, Prochorus, Leader of tAe
Clwir, points to the Lion of the tribe
of Judah, who bids the weeping cap-
tive to cease the mournful cry, and be
led back with songs of everlastingjoy,
under the standard of the Beloved,
into the inheritance which had been
lost. And the fourth, Nicanor, the
~. directs us to the Lamb
who oonquered through his being
slain; and all power and all wisdom
&re hie to enable his fbllowers to over-
come through the blood of the Lamb,
and loving not their lives unto the
death; and ~ the fifth, Timon,
a-, cbaracterizes the p-ayer and
11011g of the saints, which &re for what
men, in the pride of their own imagi-
_
nationa, have been apt to call Not
HOMW; even that Clnist should
again oome down to earth, and fix his
throne where it was promised the son
of David should reign; and that his
saints with him shonld rsign o.·er the
earth : and Parmenas, E._ .A.bidi~~g,
expresses the glory in which, shall
be the portion of the sons of God, as
being given ever to abide in their
Father's house, through the Son, who
abideth for ever: and amid the glory
of which, the angels who have kept
their first estate, aing in their gl&d re-
view of redeeming love, as given in
the sixth part of the description. And,
lastly, the seventh of these names,
Nicolas, is the name of those whose
song succeeds that of the glorified
saints, and that ofthe angela in glory.
These &re the OOflqUered p«Jpk, who
have been subdued by the great King
reigning in Zion, and placed under
the dominion of those who shall be
with him as kings and priel!ts unto
God. Be hath subdued them to his
grace by the strong rod of his power,
and having delivered them out of the
enemy's hand, and set them free from
the tyranny of every oppressor, they
serve him in obedience to his gxeat
law of love, in holiness and righteous-
ness before Him all the days of their
life. Be hath conquered, not to en-
slave, but to bless with all blessing
that can upon earth be enjoyed. His
people &re willing in the day of His
power, and all nations shall be blessed
in Him, and call Him blessed.

BOOK OF ISRAEL'S INHERITANCE
IN THE LAND.
JEll. XXL XXXI.
"The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord,
Saying, Thus speaketh the Lord God of Iorael,
Saying, Write thee all the worda that I have opoken anto thee
In a Book."
THEBE words were spoken long after
I8l'lloel had been carried captive forth
of his land; when Ephraim was to ap-
pearance lost, when even the Jews
were about being taken a'!VSy to
Babylon. Jacob was indeed made
81D8ll among the nations, a.nd ap-
peared to be devoted to destruction.
Yet God doth here still call himself
"The Lord God of Invul :" plainly
implying that he would, notwithata.nd-
ing all present appearances, continue
true to the promises made unto their
fathers ; still accomplish his design
with regard to the people he had
chosen to be peculiarly his own. It
may also be remarked, that there is 80
much, in the words hereafter written,
hard of belief; a.nd, in the then cir-
cumsta.nces of the world, even 80 un-
imaginable, that the command to write
"all the flXJf'IU," was not uncalled for.
There would have been 'danger in the
intrusting any mere creature with the
giving ouly the 114m of them. Matters
then not understood, but now appli-
cable in the II108t minute particulars,
and essential to the making out the
case fully for the rightful heir, would
otherwise have, moat probably, been
omitted. These particulars being 80
long written in a book, open to thein.
b
spection of all, are unquestionably
authentic and authoritative; a.nd are a
powerful Witneas to the truth of God.
Let ua also conllider, that, ifall the~e
matters, and if the very words in
which they a.re expressed, are of divine
dictation, it most &88uredly becomes
us earnestly to listen to them, and di-
ligently to study their import. This
should the more be the case, as we
shall find that they regard our People,
our Place, and our Time. And they
speak of that which is generally in-

is to be, of all others, the moat advan-
tageous position-the Land of Israel:
and this is to be had as a free gift from
the rightful Po888880r.
Ifthere be one portion of the earth
of more importance than another, it is
the Land of Israel. Not only baa it
been the theatre of all God's grand
manifestations of Himself to man, but,
seated there between the seas, the Red
.and theMediterranean,thesestretching
out into the two great oceans, by which
America may be reached on the one
hand, and Australia on the other, it is
most centrally placed, with regard to
water, and the more- dista.nt parts of
the globe. It is also most eligibly

placed as to land; having all Africa
spread out from it to the south, and
Europe and Asia to the north. Thi~
meeting point of all parts of the earth,
is evidently designed by the God of
Naturefor the TbroneofUDiversal Em-
pire; and this opinion is amply con-
firmed by the revealed word or God.
The people for whom this position is
appointed, are plainly the people in-
tended to have rule. God, accordingly,
from the very beginning, took them
under his especial care, and led them
about, and instructed them; and ever
wrought wondrously with them. But
about 2,500 years ago, the House of
Israel, and therein the tribe of Eph-
raim, orwhom the promised multitude
or nations was specially promised to
come, were swept away, by the Assy-
rians, into a land from which they have
never yet returned. Our view is, that
God nevertheless was true to his pro-
Inise; and ha8 so far aooompliahed
it, as that hie people have become
many nations, and theee even the chief
orthe nations,here, in the North Coun-
try, so frequently intimated in pro-
phecy as the principal quarter out of
which his people will ftow up to Jeru-
salem, when it shall be made the
Throne of the Lord. Already do they
posse~ the gate of their eneiDies; they
have broken forth on all sides; seem
adapted for all climates, and all occu-
pation&; and are rapidly colonizing the
globe. To tAem, as well as to the Jetol,
and to them in the first place, is be-
queathed the land of Israel. This will
appear in the course of the following
pages: in which it is proposed to show
that in Jeremiah, ch. :nx., xxxi., is
given a continued course or prophecy,
especially referring to Israel, the king-
dom of the Ten Tribes, or rather their
descendants in the North Country.
The prophecy commences with the
testimony of the two great witnesees,
Mercy and Judgment; the meroypro-
Inised, the judgment threatened: the
two burdens or all _
prophecy, and the
great matters to be testified or by all
that would witness for God; and cha-
racterizing the condition ofboth houses
lo their paA History. On Iarael he
had not mercy; He, to appearance, ut-
terly cast them away; yet it was that
with everlasting mercies He Inight ga-
ther them. Of Judah the case has
been different; the Lord had mercy
upon them, and saved them wonder-
fully, until the promjsecl One Seed did
come, whom the Jews rejected; and
then were they delivered over to judg-
ment, to be witnesses of hie justice
ever since, and that among all nations.
And now we approach the time, when,
casting from them their clothing of
sackcloth. they are conjointly to wit-
nesa to all the earth, of the truth and
faithfulness of God, and that in open
maniff>8tation; the purposes of God
with regard to them being revealed.
And this open witnessingis again to be
of mercy and ofjudgment; and, most
likely,in the Inidstofboth, most power-
fully displayed in them, in the blessing
and deliverance ofthe righteous, and in
the puniahment of the wicked, whose
counsels may yet -m to prosper for
a time; but the triumphing or the
wicked sbaU be short, and their por-
tion most bitter: whilst the Portion of
Israel, the Lord Himself, and in Him
all needful blessing, shall indeed be
most sweet, and shall be rejoiced in
for ever.
After the reference, in verse 3, to
the Bookofthe Inheritance, thecrown.
iDg of the Mercy promised to Israel,
when complete order shall be esta-
blished, and the perfect beauty of all
God's workings, with regard to his
people, shall be made to appear: we
have thea, in verses 4--7, the wit-
neaaing of the Judgment threatened,
the dark tnoulation intimated, through
which the world, and even Jacob,
mUBt pass, into the full enjoyment
of the glorious ealvation. Dread-
ful overturnin~ will take place when
the Lord is taking poseession, and ia
preparing the land for his favoured
people.
Therellfter, in verses 8-21, we
have aeven Securities giTen, that the
promise refers to the future, and will
most asanredly be fulfilled. These
sevtm securities we shall eee still fur-
ther t1llfoldll!ll in Ezekiel xuiii.-

THE MERCY PROMISED.
·vBlL a.
" For, lo I the days come, saith the Lord.
That 1 will bring again the captivity of My People, Israel and Judah, saith the Lord,
And I •·ill cauae them to return to the Land lhal I gave to !heir falhera,
And they lhall po- it."
IT is as being made, Ammi, My
people, as being formed anew of God
after the image of his Son, that Israel
and Judah are promised a restoration.
They must become unitedly an holy
nation, a peculiar people; prepared to
shew forth the praises of Him who
calla them out of darkness into his
·marvellous light. As possessing this
character, and occupying this position,
blessing, both temporal and spiritual,
will be abnndantly bestowed upon
them. In Joel ii. the temporal bless-
ing is mentioned, ver. 18-26, before
,the spiritual, ver. 27-29. But in
1aaiah xxx. the spiritual blessing, as
to be enjoyed in the Land, is men-
.tioned first, ver. 18-21, and after-
warda the temporal, ver. 23 - 25.
·Both paaaages undoubtedly intimate
''that the blessing is to be found in the
Land, and this after the long desola-
tions, and previous to the great and
·terrible day of the Lord, Joel ii. 31,
and while the people are waiting for
'theCoiningoftheLord, Is. xxx. 18. It
ia ala<i to be remarked, that not only
·will' the Lord give to Israel teachers,
··Is. m. 20,-pestors according to his
'heart, which shall feed them with
'·knowledge and understanding, Jer.
iii. 15; He will give also a word be-
•bind them, saying, "This is the way,
walk ye in it, when ye turn to the
right hand; and when ye turn to the
'1~.~ And not only will the Lord be
known in ihe midst of his people;
Joel ii ·27; not' only Will spiritual
gif\8' be bestowed upon some-be re-
stored gradually, as they were gradu-
ally withdra'lnl, .but, " It shall come
to ~ aftllrward, '1/w.t I will pour out
·my Spiiit ·upon '11II flesh," upon the
whole body of die people, as descnDed
Joel ii. 28, 29,and ofwhich the II88UI'8Cl
pledge was given on the day of Pen-
tecost. Now upon his holy mountain,
will the Lord spread a feast for all
people. Those who are rich and in-
creased in goods,and who stand in need
of nothing, will, of course, remain at a
distance; and perhaps smile at the
folly of those who hunger and thirst
after righteousness: But these our
God will fill with good things, while
he will send the rich empty away. To
those who will have sold all for th41
salce of Christ, the treasure hid in the
field is sure. The good will be found.
In the Mount of the Lord it shall be
seen. There He will command th.e
blessing, even life for evermore.
That which is emphatically called
Immanuel's Land, we cannot suppose
to be unworthy ofa wish. It not only
was, but is to be, the Piau of God's
manifesting Himself unto man.
The promise· of the Land to Abra-
ham remains to be fulfilled. Upon the
terms ofthe Mosaic law, a panial i>os-
aesaion was gi1en of that Land to Is-
rael under a covenant, which· they
immediately and continuously broke.
They broke that covenant, even as
Adam broke that which was msde
with him. It is only by the free
covenant, ordered in all things and
811re, that possession can be regained.
·This is ihe covenant expressed in the
words before us ; words guarantee.
ing the future return of both II!TIIel
·and Judah to the Land; in which re-
turn, as we shall see, Ephraim will
be recognised as the first-born. Af-
terwards, when his right is disputed
by the king of the north, Immanuel
Himself will appear, and fully de-
liver; and having raised the aleep..

did not p0888118, bnt they shall possess,
that which was given unto them in
promise by Him who is Faithfulness
and Truth. God will be merciful to
hia land and to hia people.
Israel shall not poesess it in the
manner Judah did upon hia return
from the Babylouiah captivity, under
the dominion of the kiugd01118 of this
world, but under the reign of the risen
saints; by whom there shall be a wile
and holy leading forth into the full
enjoyment of all that God hath pro-
vided for the happineea of his crea-
tnrea. Then, indeed, shall there be
~on. Then shall the confusion
of Israel and the disorders of the land
cease; and beauty and gladneea be the
portioo of his land and of his people.
Although the father& shall poesess
the land,as it was proorieed them, yet
that, it seems, will not be their peen-
liar posaessioo; " They looked for a
City which hath foundations, whose
Builder and Maker is God;" and they,
together with all the glorified saints,
shall be given that city to dwell in,
even " the New Jerusalem, that
oometh down ont of heaven from
God;" that " inheritance which is in-
Cl01TUpQ"ble, and undefiled, and that
· fadeth not away, which is reeerved in
heaven for them "-which is preJliU'ed
for them in heaven; and ready to be
revealed from thence, together with
their glorified Lord. That is the Fa:.
ther's house, in which are many man-
sions; into which the saints are re-
ceived, when they - d up in clouds
Ill
to meet the Lord tn the air; and in
which they shall everabide with Him,
to minister blessing to the myriads of
happy beings that shall then dwell on
the earth, under their peaceful domi-
nion,-even the eaved of the nations,
who shall walk in the light of the New
Jerusalem, and the twelve Tn"bes of
Isrsel, over whom, in that time of the
regeneration, the twelve apostles, sit--
ting upon their twelve thrones, shall
reign. Thia ehall be the peculiar
home of the saints, who shall thus be
" as the stonea of a crown lli\ed up as
an ensign upon his land." That land, ·
then the metropolis of the world, they
shall po88e88; and the kingdom and
dominion under the whole heaven, as
well as their peculiar Inheritance in
the HeavenlyJenualem,ehallbethein.
In this land, Israel, aooording to the
promise, ehall poesess the Double-the
birthright bleeaillg; everlastillg joy

Such is a aketeh of die witneuing
of the book of the whole revealed will
of our God, with regard to the Mercy
promised. It is briefly summed up in
these few words of the Lord to Jere-
miah; and, as we shall ahow, It is so-

his people, of the very land He gave
unto the falhers, and which they ahall

spoken the word; and hia word shall

loofle thyself from the bands of thy

thus Wlith the Lord, Ye have sold

The Lord will reveal Himself to
I!is People; and that in oonnectiOil
with their restoration to the Land,
and the lifting up of Jerusalem from
the deep degradation in which it bath
been ao long lying. The Lord had
complained, ch. Ji. 17-23, that aft.er
the period of Jernl!l\lem's release had
come, and when other captives were
being freed, there was none to guide
her among all the sons that abe had
brought up; and He avowed His pur-
pose to effect her delivera:'ce by His
own almighty power. Bot He de-
aires to be glorified in his people: and
this He will be, notwithstanding all
the m11chinatioua of the man of ain,
and the coalition of the kingdoms of

must not be oonfounded with the re-
turn from Babylon. .At th11t return
there was no King David raised up to
them. .And when the true David or
Beloved, and Heir of the throne, was
raised up unto them, they did not
prove willing or obedient. His claim
to be King of the Jews was not only
mocked at, but alleged as a crime for
which he should suffer the most pain-
ful and humiliating death of the cross.
But from death he was raised up unto
them, and declared to be the Son of
God with power, by the resurrection
from the dead. He was even, and
that for us, raised up to the throne of
his Father in heaven." Him hllth God
exalted with his right hand, a Prince
and a Saviour, "for to give repentance
eo Israel and forgiveness of sins."
He is the one meritorious Cause of
deliverance to ".All Israel;" and that
by even his being raised up on the
croes, as a spectllcle to angels and
to men. .And in allusion to which he
eaid, "I, if I be lifted up, will draw
.All unto me." But Israel must exalt
their King al\er another fashion. Let
Him be lifted up out of his holy
habitlltion. He waiteth for this, as it
is said, Is. xxx. 19, 20, ".And there-
fore will the Lord wait that He may
be gracious unto you; and therefore
will He be exalted that He may have
mercy upon you: for the Lord is a
God ofjudgment. Blessed are all they
that wait for Him: for the people
shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem," &c.
He who was rejected from being
King of the Jews, must be proclaimed
as King of Israel. The crown must
be given unto Him who hath a right
to reign. This was to result from the
taking of the kingdom from the Jews,
and giving it to a nation that should
bring forth the fruits thereof. May
the expectation with regard to Eph·
raim not be disappointed, as it was
with regard to the Jewish rulers, of
whom it might reasonably have been
expected, as M11tt. xxi. 37, " They
will reverence My Son:" but they
eaid among themselves, " This is the
Heir, come, Jet us kill him, and Jet us
.seize on.his Inheritance.~· May Eph-
raim's rulers know for what it is that
they have now been given the power
of loosing the. bands of 11.iokedn618; of
undoing the heavy burdens; of letting
the oppre•sed go free, and ofbreaking
every yoke.-May they at length be
taught to fulfil the kingdom's law,
which is love, and then shall the seals
be loosed-" Then shall thy light
break forth a~ the morning; and thine
he :lth shall spring forth speedily; and
thy righteousness shall go before thee:
the glory of the Lord shall be thy
rereward." See farther as to the bless-
ing of Israel's acting worthy of their
high calling, Is. )viii. 9-14.
The sending away of the gospel of
the kingdom from Jerusalem, prepa-
ratory to what is written in this first
Security, seems to be that which was
indicated by what was seen at the
opening of the first SeaL When,
Rev. iv. 1, 2, the Lamb had opened the
first Seal,and the much-neglected invi-
tation was given," Comeandsee,"there
was beheld a "white hone," betoken~
ing a message of peace. " .And he that
sat on him had a bow;" which indeed
was of Judah, but thereaft.er to be
filled with Ephraim, Zech. ix. 18;
" And a crown was given unto Him;
and he went forth conquering, and
to oonquer." He, the Word of God,
who bath " a name written which no ·
·man knew bot He himself," shall at
length be beheld as having " upon hia
vesture and upon his thigh a name
written, KING OF KINGS AND LoRD 01!'
LORDs," Rev. xix. 11-16. To Him as
Prince of Peace every knee shall bow.
Where the Lord gave forth the invi-
tation to " Come and see," there most
a~~suredly, after all its troubles, He will
give His peace to be seen. By
him thllt bath cars to bear, He will
be found the Faithful and True.

one, that had ~ brought him
• the news that the eity was smitten:
the smiting of Jerusalem was the
opening of prophecy. He was no
more dumb. He refers to the vain
boast of those who were inhabiting the
wastes of die land of larasl, "Abra-
ham was one, and he inherited the
land; but we are many, the laud ia
given us for inheritance." Thus '\'ain-
glorioualy had the inhabitant~ of J6-
rulllllem itselfrejoiced over die expa-
triation of their brethren of the ten
mbea, l&yiDg, " <rit ye far from the
Lord; unto ua ia thia land given in
pollle88iou," ch. ld.I5. But here they,
the Jewa themaelvea, who 10 boasted
apinat hrael, are recopiaed as hav-
ing utterly failed in keeping the COV&-
- nant upon which the land was given
to Iarael in poueasion. That COV&-
nant wu compriaed uwler two grell&

which, as to outward manifestation,
are contained in the firat table of the
law; and love to man, the outward
and negative u:preasion of which ia
given in the aecond table. Aa charg-

xuiii. 115, " Ye eat with the blood,
and liA up your eyea towards your

particularly as to the breach of the
aecond table, " Ye atand upon your
sword; ye work abomination; and ye
de&e every one hia neighbour's wife,
and ahall ye poaeu the land?" The
Lord then threatena to lel lool8 upon
them hia llOl'8 judgment~, the sword,
and die beaata of the field, and peati-
lenoe, in connection with deaolation ~
the land, the reault ofwhich ia famine,
v. 17-119. By th-, the peinfal dia-
penationa of divine power in judg-
meDt, were they to be utterly dia-
inherited, as haling poueasion under
the l&w, aecording to the ~
made with their ~ when they
came up out ~ the 1ani ~ Eg,pL
There ia then a reference to the caue
of the Word'e remainiug M&led up
from the people, in place of their being
INled by it. b ia not becauee they
hear not the word with the outward
ear. They were even ~aying, "every
one to hia brother, Come, I pray y011,
and hear what iathe word ofthe Lord."
And they eame unto the prvphet, and
Mt before laim as the Lord•a people,
and they heard hia worda, but thq
would not do them. With their mouth
they abowed much love, but their
heart, with that of the modern hearen
of the word, went al\er their cov&-
toUBDeaa. So did they, and ao do they
come abort of the true richea, which
are only promieed unto the man who
erie& after knowledge, and lifts up hia
voice for undenianding ; who ..U
her as silver, and aearchea for her aa
for hid treaaurea; and ianot contented
with die mere outwardvoice; as were
thoae unto whom the prophet waa "as
a very lovely aoug of one that hath a
pleasant voioe, and can play well 011
an instrwnent." So, becauee the word
ofmercy was listened to with onll the
outward ear, would the word ofJUdg-
ment moat surely take effect ; and
thereafter should the seals be un-
loosed, "and they ehail know that a
prophet hath indeed been amonr
them."-v. 30---33.
Thus have the people been to
blame; and equally 10 have been the
shepherds, who feed themeelves and
not the flocks, but rather kill thoae of
the flocks that are fed in spite of them.
With force and Ol'llelty have thq
ruled, 10 that the Lord's ftoclt hath
been scatteredupon all the face ofthe
earth. But the good Shepherd came
forth, in the apostolio preaching of the
Gospel, to seek and to ~ave that which
was lost. Having given hia life foc
the aheep, not for the nation of the
Jews only, but that he might gather
in one the ohildren of God thac were
scattered abroad: the " other aheep,"
which were not of the Jewiah fold, the

which he was more particularly aent
-who alao were- to be brought in,
that there might be one fold and one
shepherd. " For thus saith the Lord
God, I, I will both search my sheep,
and eeek them out,"-" out of all
places where they have been scattered
during the dark and cloudy day." "I
will feed them in a good pasture; and
upon the high mountains of Israel
shall their fold be." " I will feed my
flock; and I will cause them to.lie
down, saith the Lord God." And
again we have our attention directed
to the ministration of mercy and of
judgment, ch. xxxiv. 16.
"I will oeelr. that which wu IOit,
And bring lipiD that which wu driven
aw&J;
And wUI bind np that which wao brollen,
And will otrengthen that wblcb wu olelr.:
But I will deotroy the fat and the otrong1
J will feed them with Judgmeat."
The Lord himself engages to be the
Saviour of the lott house of Israel,
v. 22-24, "I will save my flock,
ud they ahall no more be a prey."
"And I will set up one shepherd over
them, and he llhall feed them " " ud
he llhall be their shepherd. 'And I
the Lord will be their God, and my
servant David," not merely a prince
overthem, "buta prince amongthem·"
and this word llhall be accomplished;
for, saith the Lord, " I have spoken it."
And in plaoe of the covenant which
11118 made with .their fathen, and
which hath "been utterly broken, He
will speak to them according to the
covenant of ~ which hath been
ordered in all things and sure. And
he will make them to eDjoy perfect
peace in the land, out of which they
were driven according to the terms of
the old cevenant. And, as sure 1111 he
hath caused the pentecostal shower to
come down in hia season, there llhall
be ahowera ofblessing:-v. 27, 28.
"And the tree of the lleld lhall yield her

And, referring to the same Root of
David-the Branchwhich 11118 togrow
out ofa dry ground; the Beloved, their
King, who was to be raised up unto
them, the prophecy here proceeds to
point out Him by whom the bands of
their yoke were to be broken-v. 29
--31. "And I fDill rai.e up for tAetll
a plant of renown, and they shall no
more be consumed with hunger in the
land, neither bear the shame of the
heathen any more. Thus shall they
know that I, the Lord their God, am
with them, and that they, the houee
of Israel are (A.mmi), my people, saith
the Lord God. And ye, my flock, the
flock ofmy pasture, men,-(Adam}-
1, your God, saith the Lord God."
The word translated " men" in the
last verse, may better be rendered
man, or Adam;that is, of earth orlike-
neee. And mah, althougl!. made of
earth, was fanned in the image ofGod;
to which image being restored, be
shall again be given the dominion;
and thus may the concluding verse
of this section be paraphrased: And
ye, my flock, the flock of my pasture,
formed after the image oftheHeavenly
Adam, shall be found worthy of your
name, man. Ye shall be found one
with the Man Christ Jesus; in whom
the inheritance ia restored that was
lost in the earthly Adam; and, better
than all, God sball be your portion.
How great, how inexhaustt'ble, the
portion contained in theee words," I
your God, saith the Lord God!" Let
the crown be indeed given unto Him
through whom alone -the deliverance
from every yoke, and the earnest of
the promised inheritance, are ob-
tained; and ao, gladly serving our

beloved King, let us rejoice 1111 being

Thus have we seen that in Jer.
XXX. 8, 9, there ia the &118111"&1lce given
that Israel sh&ll be delivered and
raised up to serve their King: who,
we know, has been raised up unto
them. And u 8llre as He hath once
come, shall He come again, and that
to the full deliverance promised.
In the opening of this eeal, Rev. vi.
I, 2, we e&w Christ going forth in the
ministration of the Gospel, the great
appointed means of raising up Israel
u from the dead ; and the sign of
their King's having been railled up to
the Father's right hand.
The expansion of this eeal we have
found in Ezek. uxiii. xxxiv., where
all the promiaea, 118 to the gathering
and e&ving the lost sheep of the house
ofIsrael, the Lord confirma. The pro-
mise we have seen fulfilled:-He hath
acoording to hia promise raised up hia
servant the Beloved, to be a Prince
among his people. And 118 truly 118
he hath done this, ehall He give them
to know that He hath broken the
bands of their yoke ; and delivered
them out of the hands of those that
served themselves of them, that they
may serve Him without fear, in holi-
neSB and righteousneSB, before Him all
the days of their life.

spirit of judgment and the epirit of

mayed, 0 Israel," seem, however, more
to refer to the other house, that of the
ten tribes; who appear to be also par-
ticularly addressed in the words that
immediately follow, "For, lo, I will
8&Ve thee from afar," unto which they
had been sent, as being cast far off
among the Gentiles. "And thy seed
from the land of their cap9vity." The
Lord had promised to Mve the houee
of Joseph when yet in the open valley;
and ultimately, not only shall they be
Mved in the Lord with an everlasting
salvation, and brought home to their
father's house in glory, constituting
the main portion of that spouse unto
which the Lord shall be married, and
whom he shall call np into his hea-
venly glory; but their seed left be-
hind them on·the earth, shall be ~
stored to the temporal poeeession of
the land, inheriting therewith the
riches of the Gentiles. And not only
shall t1tq be thus favoured, Jacob, the
other honea first spoken of in these
words, " shall return, and shall be iD
rest," and not be as hitherto, upon their
return from Babylon, continually dis-
turbed by the intruai.on of strangers.
Jacob shall now have truly wrestled,
and overcome, " the spirit of grace and
of supplication" having been poured
out upon him. Ar. Jacob, when he
obtained the name of Israel, wept 1md
made supplication unto the angel, so
shall this remaining portion of his de-
.soendiUlts. Thenshall they "look upon
Him whom they have pierced, and
ahall mourn." Then the Lord shall
give run deliv81'1111Ce. In Jesus, Judah
also shall be bleeaed, and made one
with Israel; so shall all Israel be
quiet in himself;" Ephraim shall not
eDTY Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim."
And 118 Israel shall be quiet in him-
eelf, so externally also shall there be
none to make afraid. Ilia enemies all
around will have been cut off, " 1md
there shall be no more a pricking brier
unto the bonae of Israel, nor a griev-
ing thorn of all round about them."
"Thus saith the Lord God: When I
ahall han gathered the bouse of Is-
rael from the people among whom
they are -"ered, and shall be sanc-
tified in them in the aight of the hea-
then, then shall they dwell in their
land that I have given to my servant
Jacob. And they shall dwell safely
therein, and shall build houses, and
plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell
with oonfidence, when I have exe-
cuted judgments upon all those that
despise them round about them: and
they shall know that I am the Lord
their God."
When Israel had fled afar, as taJdng
refuge along the coaets of Europe, in
the Tyrean and Egyptian oolouiea,
there seeking to esoape from the As-
syrian, who came np and swept away
the remnant into the land of their
captivity in the North Country,-then
did hia case seem indeed desperate.
Yet was God hereby preparing for his
~ to become the promised multi-
tude of natioos. In the m81Ultime,
hls enemies have been, and are being,
dashed against each other and de-
stroyed; and this shall be, until, upon
his ultimate return; he "shall seek
them and shall not find them; even
all that contended with him. They
mall be as nothing, and as a thing of
nought." Then, indeed, shall Jacob
"return, and be in rest; and be quiet,
and none shall make him afraid." We
have here ample seenrity that the
event described is something different
from what has yet taken place; and
that it will introduce into a peace
Iwhich will be permanent. Now this

of that which has cnlated diequiet,
appears to be the nbject of the ae-
cond ~. Rev. vi. 3, 4.
The election of Ierael having ob-
tained the bleeaing, expreaeed b;t the
white bone ofthe First Seal, we have
now deecribed the portion of Edom,
the people againet whom the Lord
said he would have indignation for
ever; the people who had usurped the
inheritance and throne, and even the
very name of Judah; and who, hav-
ing efl'ectually eold the birthright, in
the Cll8e of Chriet, deeel"red to be dis-
inherited; and thie wae to be byjudg-
ment, deeon"bed in the goi"«B forth of

The fint of theee three horeee anewere

bloodshed. And power wae given to
him that 1111t thereon, to take peace
from the earth or land; which wae
effectually done when that irrecon-
cilable enmity broke out between the
Jews and the Romans, · which pro-
duced that general and continual war-
fare between them, ae descn"bed by
Joeephna. The great Swordmay more
particnlarly refer to that exceeding
elanghter whieh took place at the de-
etrnetlon of Jernealem ; when the
Jewieh rnlers had the firet part of
their wish gratified, " His blood be
upon us and on our children." These
bad for the time linked their fortunes
with Edom, and must for 110 long a
time endure the curse, even until his
blood shall he removed from the midst
of them.
Onr Lord, as executing judgment
by the slaughter of the enemy, is de-
I!Cn"bed, lea. lxiii.
" Who ia thia that eometli from Edom,

And I will etaln all •1 raiment. •
For the day or •enceanCt" Ia In mine heert.
And tbe year or my H<Jeemed Ia eome.''
What follows 1in this prophecy
plainly in'timates that the slaughter of
Edom, from which the Lord has come,
and the still greater destruction of the
enemy more generally, nnto which be
is proceeding, are all in order to pro-
vide peace for his people. And snch
also is intimated in the expansion of
this Second Seal, Ezek. :uxv., :axvi.
1-15. Here, as in Isa. lxiii. this
judgment begins with the message of
judgment upon Edom, to whose name,
red or bloody, there seems to be a
frequent reference in the prophecy.
"Beca-thau haathaclaperJietUal hatTed,

Thereafter tlle deeolation of Moun\

then the reaeon is ueigned, " Because
thou hast said these two nations, and
these two countries shall be mine, and
we will JlOil8888 it; wbereae the Lord
was there." Upon the captivity of the
Jews the Edomite came down and
dwelt in their land, and 110 continued;
110 that an Idumean was even king of
the Jews, and sought to slay the right-
ful heir to the throne of David in the
slaughter ofthe infants of Bethlehem.
Yetneitherdid Edomprosper,ashaving
110 obtained the dominion. Blood did
pursue him, even into the streets of
Jerusalem, and the receSIIeS of the
temple; and blood abundantly :flowed
both from the Edomitee, under the
name of Jews, and from their enemies
the Romans, with whom they bad
joined bands against the Lord, and
againllt his Anointed. The Lord bath
indeed judged Edom, both as to place
and people; and it is here, v. 11, pro-
mised that He will be knoWD among
Israel, when He hath been known to
judge Edom. The desolationsofEdom,

it would seem, are to continue even un-
til Israel should have filled the face of
the earth with fruit: " Thus eaith the
Lord God, when the whole earth re-
joiceth' I will make thee deeolate; as
thou didat rejoice in the inheritance of
the house of Israel, because it waa de-
80late, 80 will I do unto thee. Thou
shalt be de80late, 0 Mount Seir, and
all Idumea, all of it. And they shall
know that I am the Lord."
The prophecy then turns from
Mount Seir to the mountains of Is-
rael, of which the enemy had eaid,
"Aha! even the ancient high places
are 0111'8 in poaseSBion,'' ch. xxxvi
6. " Surely in the fire of my jealousy
have I spoken against the residue of
the heathen, and against all Jdumea,
which have appointed my land into
their poSBeSBion with the joy of all
their heartj with despiteful minds, to
cut it out for a prey. Prophecy there-
fore concerning the land of Israel,
Thus eaith the Lord God, Behold, I
have spoken in my .jealousy, and in
my fmy, because ye have borne the
shame of the heathen: therefore thus
eaith the Lord God, I have lifted up
mine hand, surely the heathen that
are about you, they shall bear their
shame. But ye, 0 mountains of Is-
rael, ye shall shoot forth your branches,
and yield your fruit to my people of
Israel, for they are at hand to come.
Behold, I am for you, and I will turn
unto you, and ye shall be tilled and
80wn. And I will multiply men upon
you;" not the house of Judah only,
but " all the bonae of Israel-all of it.
And the cities shall be inhabited, and
the wastes shall be builded." And the
names of Joseph and of Ephraim shall
be again written upon them: " They
shall i~ and bring fruit; and I
will settle you after your old estates,
and will do better than at your be-
ginnings:" thus shall Jacob be in rest.
" And I will cause men to walk upon
you, my people Israel; and they shall
poaseaa thee; and thou shalt be their
Inheritance, and thou shalt no more
[S:ux. u.
henceforth bereave them:" There shall
be none to make Iarael afraid: "Nei-
ther shalt thou cause thy nations to
fall any more, eaith the Lord God."
Thus has the Lord been clearing the
land of Israel's inheritance; and thus
will he clear it with the sword of his
judgment, although all the nations of
the earth should be gathered there to
battle. The heathen shall certaiDly
be disinherited, that Iarael may pos-
seaa his Inheritance in peace.
Thus have we seen from Jer. ch.
xxx. v. 10, that both houses of Israel,
in the great Return promised, will be
entirely unmolested by the enemy,
and thereafter will remain in internal
quiet and external peace ; and, as
only a portion of Judah returned from
Babylon, and then found their fields
seized by Edom, who ultimately also
swampedtheircommonwealth. As they
had upou that return to build up the
walla of Jerullalem with weapons in
their hands, and were never thereafter
in perfect peace so as not to be afraid;
80 surely is the predicted Return yet
to take place, when Jeruaalem shall
be what ita name implies, the Sight of
Peace; and when the blessing spoken
of in the name of the capital of Israel
shall be realized in fnlneSB, the Lord,
the Keeper of Israel, keeping them in
perfect peace for ever.
Upon the openingofthe second seal,
Rev. vi 3, •• we have seen the Lord's
powerful provision, in the great sword,
for the removal of the man of blood
within the camp of Judah, and all the
enemies around the Inheritance of Is-
raeL
This we have seen further illus-
trated in Ezekiel, x=v.ll:ll:xvi 1-16;
where it is shown that the Lord hath
indeed provided a sword, whereby
Edom and all the haters of Israel shall
be cut off, as intimated by the going
forth of the red horse: subsequent to
which all Israel shall repoaseSB their
land in perfect peace: having nothing
within to disturb their quiet, or from
without to make them afraid.

"For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to eave thee:
Though I make a fuD end or all nations
Whither I have scattered thee,
Yet will I not make a full end or thee.
But I will correct thee in measure ;
And will not leave thee altogether unpunished.•
THE Lord engages to be ever with
Israel, and that for ealvation. It
seelll8 to be here intimated that Israel
would be qttered among various
nations, that would come to nonght;
whilst Israel would gradnally get
stronger and more numerous. Thus
would they come to inherit the
Gentiles, a goodly heritage of the hosts
ofnations. It is Israel who is here more
particularly spoken of, the desolate
woman, who was to have many more
ohildren than Judah, than she which
hath an husband. Israel was to break
forth on the right hand and on the
Ie~; her Maker was to be her Hus-
band, the God« the whole earth shall
He be called. God, in the words b&-
fore us, promilles to limit the judg-
ment, eo as that Israel shall be pre-
eerved. They shall be corrected in
measure, with fatherly chastisement,
for their good. This we believe to
have been eminently the case with
regard to these our nations. '
It may be farther remarked that, as
when the Returnwasmoreparticularly
spoken of, v. 10, the first and two last
linea, of the six, referred to Judah, and
the other three lines, speaking of Sal-
vation, pointed more to Israel ; 80 here,
when Salvation ia more the theme, the
~ and two last linea seem particu-
larly to refer to Israel, and the central
three to Judah. . Of Israel it Ia eaid,
tJ
" For I am with thee, aaith the Lord,
to save thee." He said be would fol-
low outcast Israel, and be to them as
a little Sanctuary in the countries into
whioh they should come. Still would
he be claiming to be King in Israel,
whose four leading standards, of Ju-
dah, Ephraim, Reuben, and Dan, are
auppoaed to have been the same in
figure with the deaoription given of
the four living creatures. He would
be in the micbt of the camp of Israel,
to save theni, to procure their free jus-
tification, through faith in the great
Propitiation, with the blood of which
the meroy-eeat, the'throne of the King
of Israel, is sprinkled. He would be
near to cleanee them, and write upon
the table of their hearts the law of his
kingdom ru. formerly hia law was
written upon tables of stone, and de-
posited in the ark upon which the
meroy..-t was placed. He was 80 to
be with them, as that, when they came
to recognize him as the God of their
fathers, He might be able to say,"Yea,
I have loved thee with an everlasting
love ; therefore with loving-kindneaa
have I drawn thee."
To Judah the words seem more
particularly addressed-" Though I
make a. full end of all nations, whither
I have scattered thee, yet will I not
ma.ke a full end of thee." The Jews

crea.sed,. and a.re rapidly .llpl'tlllding"

fore this differenoe? Is it beca.use ·
these ha.ve not together been against
Juda.h ? No, but bee&use they a.re
~ own ftesh and blood,-the lost
house oi Joseph, unto whom, u in
Egypt, these his brethren ha.ve come
down to buy com, u when the fa.mine
was aore in the land. ·To obtain the
means of preserving their souls alive
ha.ve they oome: and they ha.ve fed a.t
Joseph's ta.ble, and yet they knew him
not, and he ha.th &lao dea.lt with them
u if they were not true men. He
hath indeed spoken roughly to them
-yet h&th he been prosperous, and
been given power, where he first a.p-
pea.red u an ouWL&t stra.nger: for this
is he to whom tbe words a.re a.ddreaaed,
" But I will correct thee in mea.sure ;
and will not lea.ve thee a.ltogether UJI-
punished." God ha.d.purposed to aa.ve
the house of Joseph ; but UJia.lloyed
ea.lvation would ha.ve been more than
he could bee.r; and ao not a.!together,
a.lthough a.lmoet, would he be let\ un-
punished. "In meeaure wlien it shoot-
eth forth thou wilt deba.te with it; He
sta.yeth his rough wind in the da.y of
his east wind." He would be oorrected
u he was able to bea.r; and puniahed,
not for de&truc.tion, but in mercy and
for healing.
This careful preeerva.tiou, on the
part of the Keeper of Israel in their
midst, is deacribed a.t the opening oi
the third sea.I, Rev. ch. vi. ver. 6, 6.
There is seen going furth a. black
hone, the sign ofcondemna.tion: " And
he tha.t aa.t on him ha.d a. pair of ba.-
lance$ in his hand." There is a. weigh-
ing out of just judgment upon the
enemy. But wha.t is the voice of Him
who aa.ith, " I am with thee, aa.ith the
Lord, to a&ve thee?" Wha.t aa.ith He
who is in the midst of the four living
Qre&turea? It is a. voice commanding
an ameliora.tioa of the threa.tened evil,
IQ ~ Israel -.y be ~ a.liw
in the famine, tha.t he ma.y be cor-
rected, but in mea.sure; and tha.t the
mea.ns ma.y be let\ for his oomfort and
healing. Thiu ma.y we rest perfectly
&88ured tha.t I81'8el cannot ha.ve pe-
. riakecl,. &mid .tliti eoniulsioils of em-
pires, or the wuting of other judg-
·ments. These might indeed wea.r out
the i:l&tions among whom they ha.d
come, but lsra.el would &88uredly a.bide,
and be bettered by even his severer
changes. So ha.ve the origina.l inha.bit-
ants of Europe melted a.wa.y, or been
pushed into comers, or become merged
in the ra.ce we identify with Isra.el :
who ha.ve ever continued to grow; and,
in genera.! to be improved by a.ll tha.t
has befa.llen them. So has it in gene-
ra.! been in a.ll the countries into which
they ha.ve come• .AJ surely u the Jews
ha.ve been kept alive among them; so
surely ha.ve these nations, tha.t ha.ve
sprung of the other house of Isra.el,
multiplied, and been lifted into power,
and given ca.use of rejoicing, and the
mea.na ofspreading the joy ofthe Lord
among a.ll people, u was promised
would be the case with the heira of
the promilles ma.de unto the fathere;
and which promises Ephra.im wu to
inherit.
The expansion of this third sea.l we
ha.ve Ezek. :oxvi. 16-38. lsra.el is
there reoosaised, v. 19, as BC&ttered
among the hea.then, and dispersed
thrOugh the countries; and u ha.ving
profllned the Lord's holy name whither
they went: and yet for the ea.ke oftha.t
Na.me he premises to save them. The
people here spoken of seem more pal'-
ticula.rly to be of the house of Juda.h;
who &re genera.lly by Ezekiel ca.lled
lara.el, as by wa.y of clistinction he _
ca.lls
those of the ten tribes "All Isra.eL"
He whoee name they ha.d profaned in
the midst of the hea.then, has been
atill in the midst oi them. And he
will a&ve them tempora.lly, ta.king
them from among the heathen, and
ga.thering 'them out of a.ll oountries,
a.nd bringing them into their own land.

own Spirit within them, he will give
them to !88 the kiugdom of God.
It eeema to be to this portion of
Scripture that our Lord more pe.rti-
cularly refers in hie ocnveraetioD with ·
Nicodemus. A ruler of the Jews, a
muter in Israel, ought to have known
theae things, which regard the prepa-
ration of that people for the kingdom
of God. Ere the Jews can enjoy the
promiaed bleaaing of rest in the land,
that promiae which is here given muat
be fulfilled, ver. 25. " Then will I
sprinkle clean water upon you, and
ye ahall be clean: from all your filthi-
D811, and from all your idols will I
cleanae you." And not only muat
they repent of their former wicked-
neaa, but be filled with the fruits of
righteouaneu, aa in v. 26. " A new
heart also will I give you, and a new
spirit will I put within you; and I
will take away the atony heart out of
your fteah, and I will give yon an
hee.rt of ftesh." And the great canae
of this cleansing and filling ia here
pointed out; and the effect ia lltated
with equal plainneu, when it ia llllid,
v. 27. "And I will put my Spirit
within you; and canae you to walk in
my statutes, and ye ahall keep my
atatutu, and do them." Then it ia
that they ahall dwell in the land that
he gave to theirfathers, and they ahall
be hie people, and he will be their
God-so shall he Mve them unto
glory; and then shall the judgment
of famine, threatened in thia eeal, be
removed. " I will oall for the corn,
and lay DO famine upon you; and I
will multiply the fruit ofthe tree, and
the increaae of the field, that ye shall
receive DO more reproach of famine
among the heathen." "And the de-
eolate land shall be tilled, whereas it
lay desolate in the light of all that
paased by. And they ahall•y, This
land that waa desolate is become like
the garden of Eden. Thua saith the
Lord God, I will yet for this be en-
quired of by the bonae of Iarael, to do
ii for them; I will incre&!!e them with

be filled with fiocb of men: and they
shall know that I am the Lord." They
ahall know that He ia the Jehovah,
the ever-living, life-giving, life-pre-
lllll'Ving God.
Thna have we aeeu, from this third
aecnrity, Jer. xxx. 11, that the utter
extinction of other nations ia no good
~nnd for believing that Israel alao
may have periahed. The Ever-living
Jehovah gives himaelf' to be in the
midst of hie people for their pniii81'V&-
tion; 10 that, although the nations
among whom they have been scattered
ahonld periah, they ahall remain. They
ahall not be lost among other Dationa,
although other nations may be aup-
planted by them. What may be for
the destruction of others, will be
for their correction and consequent
improvement. The Jews have been ·
preserved among the Fnlneaa of the
Nationathathavebeen thnadealtwith;
and who, by every other evidence, vin-
dicate their being deacended of the
lost brother of Judah: even of Joaeph,
whoae offspring, bred up in ignorance
of their fil&hera' toil and origin, have
indeed been made fruitful, 10 aa, like
their father, to haw the power of dis-
tributing bread unto the nations.
We hate !88n that, whilat the rider
on the black hone betokened famine,
He who ia with lara6l had appointed
a sufficiency to be reserved for hie
people, which oan only be had for
Judah in the camp of Iarael.
We have 188n from the es;pu:urion
of this •• Ezek. :urri. 16-38, that
1111'1181, scattered among all natiou,
would be pl'll88I'Ved of the Lord, not
becanae of their own merit. This
goodneaa of God towards Iarael is not
to lead them to aelf-oomplacency, hn~
repentance: let them prize Him whoae
name bath been put upon them, and
aearoh mto the ricbea of that Name.
They have been auatained in the
midst of famine; and shall be restored

Why crieot thou for thine a1Biction ?
Thyeorrow ia incurable for the multitude otthine iniquity:
Thy sins were increued:
I hAve done theee thinp onto thee.~
TBUB words moat ltrikingly expreas
the utterly lost condition of Israel in
themselves; and as plainly intimate
that their recovery can only come from
God. And that thia recovery shall
come, ia as clearly expressed, by the
fact that this description of the con-
dition into which they brought them-
selves, ia inserted in the very oentre of
the fullest assurances of the Lord's
purposea, with regard to their preser-
vation, restoration, and full salvation:
as by Himself accomplished, through
their beloved King, who was to be
raisedup, v.9; their Governor,thatwas
toproceed from the midst ofthem,v. 21.
The words appear to point to both
ll!l'Bel and Judah, but first and last to
the former, whose outward destruction
wasmore complete. Thus," Thybruise
i a incurable," did indeed characterize
ll!l'Be!'a case as being bruised by the
Aaayrian, even to ~ being trodden
down like t.he mire oCthe Areet: tiom
which fallen and trampled-upon con-
dition, there was no restoration to the
land. OfJudah itmight besaid, "Thy
wound ia grievous;" for, although they
were allowed to return from the Baby-
loniah captivity, yet the wound still
remained painful and open : the king-
dom was never restored to the hoUile
of David; they were never entirely
able to defend themselves from aur-
rounding foes. To ll!l'Bel it might
truly be said, "Thou hastnoneto plead
thy e&Uile that thou mayest be bound
up:" be cured of her braise, and given
the form of a body politic in the sight
Qf the lations. And although thia
pleadingtook place in behalfofJudah,
so that their restoration wss confirmed
to Nehemiah, and their preservation in
other countries granted at the suit of
Esther, still they had no " healing me-
dicines," that oould effectually cure
the wound that had been inflicted

lovers of Israel eo entirely forgat
her, that she W88 aa if blotted out of
the world's remembrance, or only
reckoned among the things that had
been; none recognised her any more:
abe W88 called the lost house of lerael.
And, 88 to Judah, although still in the
view of the world, and in poeeei!Sion of
Jerusalem, unto which all the sur-
rounding nations had sought in the
days of Solomon, the words were 88
truly fulfilled with regard to her,
" They seek thee not."
Again, of Judah it might be said,
when the wound W88 eo made to bleed
afresh, upon the irreooncileable enmity
arising between them and the Romans;
and when they were utterly expelled
from their land, and not even allowed
to look baok to Jerusalem, "I have
wounded thee with the wound of an
enemy." And by the same power
that brake in pieces the whole land,
and trampled the residue under the
feet thereof, were Israel attacked in
the north oountry, and even "with
the cha&tieementofa"still more"cruel
one." TbepuniahmentoftheJewa,the
known descendants of Abraham, W88
doubtless for the mnltitude of their
iniquity, 88 filled up in ·their hatred
and crucifixion of their promieed Mes-
siah; saying, "We have no king but
Ceeaar;" " not this man but Barabbas."
And true it W88 of the unknown
children of Joeeph, that the inoreaee
of their sins brought upon them the
ch88tieement they received. To weep-
ing Judah it now eeemed to be said,
" Why crieat thou for thine affiiction?
Thy sorrow ia incurable for the mnl-
titude of thine iniquity." Having re-
jeoted the only Physician by whom
they can be cured, and their restora-
tion eft'eoted, they have been left with
their grievous wound till thisday. And
surely to theee nations, that have come
of Joeeph, it may be said, notwith-
standing their nominal submii!Sion to
Christ~ " Thy sins were increaeed."
And Jiow is our guilt indeed inorea&ed
by the consideration of what the Lord
hath wrought? Contemplating this
pleaeant land, and the goodly heritage
~ the hosts of nations over which we
have been placed in power; with all
the bleaainga of the heavenly glory in
view, and all the riches of the earth
poured at our feet; our minds pre-
sented with all the stores of science,
and our hands filled with all the in-
strumentalities of art, we are pot to
say, " Mine own wisdom hath gotten
me all this·" or "mine own idol hath
executed it':" but we should hear the
moat gentle reproof of our Father,
while He is saying, "I have done theee
things unto thee." It is He that hath
raised up Israel 88 from the dead; and,
eo far 88 we could bear, ful1illed unto
us the promiees made unto the fathers:
He h88 been giving us the birthright
blessing, the double portion, for all our
sins. And, having been given this
knowledge, may we know, that the
goodneBS of God leadeth us to repent-
anoe. Well may we say," What hath
the Lord wroughtI" Soon may the
words of the parable be fulfilled in the
whole C888 of Ephraim, " This my eon
which W88 dead ia alive again; he W88
lost, and is found."
Desperate indeed, 88 that desmibed
in the text, W88 the C888 of Israel when
brought into the wilderness in the
north oountry, and when the Lord
more especially interposed in her be-
half, and spoke words of peace unto
her: preeented himselfunto her 88 her
good physician; and offered to oover
her nakedneBS with his own most per-
fect righteouaneas. This is the very
time in which from the beginning he
said he would relent over lost Israel ;
see Dent. xxxii. 36-39.
"For the Lord ahall judge his people,
And reJ><'nt himaelt tor hil ae"anu,
When he -th tbat-power Ia gone,
And-none abut up or left.
And he shall say, Where-their gocilf

eaken ido)a. It is true, she hath not
beenwith the Lord; neither, however,
hath she been for another man. But
at the time thai our race came into
Weetem Europe, they were in the v,ry
circ11matanoea here described. They
were ,.orahippera of idola; and in the
JDOit holy p~ of their temples, aa Oil
the DHII'C1-.-t. where the Divine Pre.
118Il08 in the temple of Jehovah more
eepecially rested, had they placed the
images of their gods, thai had come
newly up; auch aa Odin and Thor.
They carried the enaigns of theae be-
fore their armies; yet were they driven
aa ~beep before their enemie1. The
Gotha, precipitated upon their ancient
and moet determined foes, the Romana,
seemed by these to be given help: yet
were they let\ to perish in the place
given them for refuge on the south of
the Danube. Their case eeemed to be
indeed a loet one. Yet from thence
were theylif\ed ap to become the head
of the heaiheB. Rome iteelf submitted
to them ; and the provinoes were
parted among their tribes. When their
power waa gone; when they seemed
to be utterly broken down; when they
~ed but mockery and deceit from
thoee th41y truated in; then waa the
Lord etrong in their behalf. Then
did he preeent to them the glad tidings
of his everl4&ting ealvation; and give
them to rule over their oppreaeors.
Still he had to sey, that their sins
were increaaed; Christianity itaelfthey
corrupted with idolatry, and all sorts
of departure from the God unto whom
it should lead. Therefore heve chil-
dren been their oppressors; therefore
have all the evila, with which they
have been visited, ocme upon them.
But still, in all, the goodness of God
bath prevailed; I, seith the Lord, have
done theee things unto thee. Oar
strength, therefore, is to ley hold upon
his atrength; to ley hold upon the
skirt of his garment, and be made one
with him. Oar eafety is not in stand-
ing apart from him, or in waiting, un-

know• it all, and hath promised never-
theless to be with us, and to perfect
our salvation. Let us then distrust all
else, and take refuge only in Him who
is mighty to ~ave.
The case we have been COD&idering,
in this fourth 118C11rity, is lltrikingl
pourtrayed at theopening ofthe fo~
..I, Rev. vi. ver. 7, 8, where there is
seen going forth a pale, or livid green
horse; and his name that eat on him
waa Death, and Hell followed with
him. And power waa given them over
the fonrth part of the earth, to kill-
with the sword, or war, the aubjeet of
the eeocnd seal; snd hWigllr, or fa-
mine, the 111bject of the third seal;
and with Death, or Peatilenoe, the
subject of this fourth seal; and there
are added, " the beaste of the earth."
Thue four sore judgments are the
four winds, or apirits of the Heavena,
referred to in Zech. ch. vi. ver. 5; and
so frequently menti011ed in this order
throlighouttheprophets: together,they
expresa a state of the utmoat ruin and
helpleseu&e~. They are restrained from
being let locae in their fury, until in
the apostolic age, the llllgel should go
forth to seal a certain nnmber of all
the tribee of Israel, aa a kind of tim-
fruits of hia creaturee. These, the
til'llt-fruitl, were to follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth, snd are ulti-
mately to be found standing with him
upon .Mount Zion, having their Fa.-
ther'a name written in their forehead&.
Compare Rev. vii. 1-8, with ch. xiv.

The utterly destroyed C011diti011 of
Israel is descnOOd in the next portion
of Ezekiel, oh. xxxvii. Judah's going

had been so long threatelled, is de-

is so frequently called " All Israel."
They haci alreaciy eutrered a political

cui hotUie of Iarael, eeemed indeed to
he inlllll'&ble. And the question ia put
by the Lord himaelf, " Son of man,
can these bones live?" The question
wu one which many have &DIIWered
in the negative. But the prophet an-
awen aright, " 0 Lard God, thou
lmowest." The Lord then dinleta 1111
to the word of prophecy aocordizl« to
which all thia had come to pua. It
had all been exhibited in Tision tram
the days of their coming out of Egypt;
and in the ~~~me word of prophecy
which had foretold the evil, baa been
provided the remedy. That which ia
lDlpolllible with man is poB&ible with
God; and u He has IBid the word, it
shall moet asauredly come to pua.
Accordingly the word is given, " 0 ye
dry bones, hear the word of the Lord."
" Hear," u elaewhere it ia llllid, "and
your BOuls shall live." The word ex-
hibiting God's redeeming love ia that
which gives life, and it ia IICCODlpanied
with the spirit of prophecy, which ia
the testimony of JesU&. There ia a
foretelling of what the Lord would do
in 001111ection with the being bom of
the incorruptible seed of the word.
The great result is spoken of,-" Be-
hold," IIIith the Lord God, " I will
oauae brei.th to enter into you, and ye
shall live." And then the proce18 of
the reaarreotion ia described, clearly
diatingniabingit from the litAir&l resur-
rection af the llllinta, which is to he in-
ltalltaneoua, whereas thia ia gradual;
thia ia tohe to .,mtuaJ. emtenoe, that
to he to etenlal glory. " I will lay
linswa upon yon, and will bring up
flesh upon yon, and Olmll' you with
akin, and put breath in yon, and ye
shall live. And ye ahall know that I
am the Lord." They would know
that He wu the ever-living, lif~ving
Jehovah. They might not know what
they had been, more than that they
had been sinnera " dead in trea~
and sins." They might not know that
the Lord had spoken and fulfilled his
word, as to llrael's death and :re8111'-
rection being faiDlled in their OWII
case. But they would, u babes, know
the Father,frcm whom they W anew
reoeived exiatenoe. Unlike the wise
men of the world, who would haVA
been apt to reject the fooliahne11 of
preaching as means altogether.unfitted
to aocompliah the end, the prophet did
u he was commanded, and the word
came with power, BO far u that, " Be-
hold a shaking, and the bones came
tclgether, bone to his bone." And u
he beheld, lo, greater strength wu
given, " the sinews and the flesh came
up upon them, and the akin covered
them above:"-" But no breath in
them." This had been spoken offirst
and last, but still 18611led to he with-
held. .A trial thia offaith to the pro-
phet. What now wu to he done ?
"'Prophesy to the wind; prophesy, BOD
of man, and say to the wind, Thus
IIIith the Lord God, Come from the
four winds, 0 breath ! and breathe
upon these Blain, that they may live."
So, uulilte many deapiaers ofprophecy,
Ezekiel prophesied as he was tlom-
manded; and the result &Dllwered:
" Breath came into them, and they
ltood upon their feet, an exoeeding
great army." The interpretation Ia
given,-" 'fheae bones are the whole
house ofIsrael. Behold they say, Our
bones are dried, our hope ia loet, we
.are out oft' for our -parta." It is need-
1818 to say that thia ia not the lan-
guage of thol8 who ahall rise m that
which ia apoken of as the first resur-
rection. Neither ia it the language of
the Jews; who have not IBid, " Our
hope ia loat; we are cut ofi' COl' our
parts." But thia - . clearly to have
been the language of Israel, when they
gave themaelv111 up to be Lo-ammi,
and, for their part, not only gave up
all portion in the eon of Jeaee, but
also any expectation af a portion in
the land. .As for the Jews, they might
have both, if they chcee: but as for
them, Ephraim and his companions,
they eitpeoted good in neither; and 10
would go bury themeelves among the
heathen. But the Lord's purpoee was
different: " Therefore prophesy and
ay unto them, Thus IIIith the Lord
God, Behold, 0 my people, I will open
your graves; and causeyou tocome up

of Israel." The words imply that tile
reaurrection would take place out of
the land.
With regard to the Jews, who by
Ezekiel are frequently oalled Israel, it
~ to be pn!dicted, cb.. lCC[vi, ver.
24, that their conversion would prin-
cipally take place iu. tile land : bu
here the caae of that house which ia
by Ezekiel called All Israel, ia very
dift'erently deacribed. The Jews, who
have always had a knOWJl existence,
are to be converted to the Triune Je-
hovah in truth and righieousnesa; but
the house of .All Israel, wko had suf-
fered a political death, whose exist-
ence was not known, are promised to
be brought out of their pvea. They
are to be given a resurrection, and the
knowledge of the Lord, ud his Spirit
ia to be put within them; all previou&
to their being placed in their own
land. The beginning and end of thia
proce88 are stated iD. v. 12, .and then
the particalara are given in the two
following venea, v. 13, l4. The oon-
founding the ceeea ofthese two houses,
and applying predictions to the m~e,
which in truth belong to the other,
baa, of course, led to a deep darkell-
ing of counsel by words withont
knowledge, and great oontradiction
among interpreters of prophecy. It ia
not by appending 0111' own thoughts
to the words of Scripture, but by dis-
cerning the mind of God therein, that
we can arrive at the truta of what ia
revealed. The ceeea of Israel, and of
.All Israel, u spoken of in Ezekiel; of
Judah and of Israel, as spoken of in
Jeremiah, are indeed distinct, and iu.
many respects, as here, quite opposite.
Let it thea be remembered, that un-
like the case of Judah and hia com-
panions, the Spirit is to be put witkiD.
Ephraim and the tribes of Israel hia
fellows, previoua to their coming to-
gether into the promised land. And
they shall know the Lord, when they
are brought out of their graves : But
when hia Spirit hath beeu. put within
them, ancl they shall live, and shall
be given their own land; then shall
they, as having grown in spiritual
atrength, " know Him that ia from the
beginning." "Then shall ye know that
I the Lord have spoken it," at the be-
ginning; " and performed it " even
unto the end.
First, they are known of God; then
they know the LGrd, and have ex-
perience ef the life which ia in Him;
and at leugth they recognise Him u
the mighty God of Israel, who hath
wisely purposed, and in power accom-
plished, all that preparatjgn through
which they llave passed u being the
people whom he chose to be peculiarly
hia own.
Thua have we, under ihia fourth
118111, seen from Jer. xxx. 12-15, that
Israel cannot be more lest than the
condition her Redeemer kath recog-
uised in the very midst of his most
aeeured promises to redeem. It can-
llet be a&id, tkat, notwithstanding all
thjl foregoing promises of deliverance
to Israel, they have become 80 lost in
sin and consequent destruction, that
God hath found it neceeeary to break
hia free proDiite; and take another
people in their reem, eatirel,y to the
excl.uaion of the natural .branches. No,
it was even the lost sheep of tile house
of ISl'lle!. that Christ specially came to
redeem.
Upon the opening ofthia feurth seal
in Rev. vi. 7, 8, we have selln that the
~ttarly milled condition of the people
ia described, under the figure ofDeath,
er Peatilence, going forth upon the
pale horse, when the four sore judg-
ments, 80 long threatened, are let
loose for the utter dissolution of that
body politic which could not be purged
by the preceding warnings, first of .
mercy, and then, once and again, of
judgment.
.And iD. Ezekiel we have seen, that
the utterly ruined condition of Illl'&el,
as viewed iD. tkemselvea, ia described
by the valley ofdry bones. And there
we have seen also deecribed tileir gra-
dual resurrection u it has been; and
tile promised bestowment of the Spirit
tlirough the medium of prophecy, as
it shall be. " 0 Israel, thou hut de-
stroyed thyself, but in me is thy help."
" I have done these things unto
thee."

8-lli, like its oounterput, v. ll, oon-
taina a contrast of larael's caae, with
regard to preaervatioa. In v. 11,it wu
intimated, that, a.a 8Ul'ely a.a other ua-
tions may have periahed, larael would
be preserved; and here there is a
oontrast between the thooght of God
and the thought of man, aa to their
health and cnre;and it is implied their
enemiea ahall sink under the ills they
have laid upon Israel.
In this p118811ge, ver. 16, 17, the
exprel!8ioiUI again alternately beloug
to Israel and Judah. Thus," there-
fore all they that devour thee ahall
be devoured," I!88Dl8 more particu-
larly to be spoken of Israel, with
regard to whom, even Ephraim and
the inhabitants of Samaria, it is said,
Isaiah, iL Ill, " The Syrians be-
fore, and the Philiatinea behind; and
they ahall devour Israel with open .
mouth;" which words imply that the
face of Ephraim would be towards the
north country, in which direction lay
Syria; whilst Philistia lay behind
them; and in this backslidiug state,
with their face turned away from
the hoW18 of the Lord, they would
be devoured by all the surroundiug
people. In the meantime, the adver-
aaries of Judah, which were, how-
ever, to be cut oft', (see Isaiah, :d 13,)
were rather inorea.aed, both in num-
bers and virulenoe, through the de-
vouring of Israel, in whioh, at first,
the Jewa aeemed to have rejoiced.
But aa the adveraariea of Judah have
gone into captivity, 10 have thoee that
devoured Israel been devoured; they
ere not now known to exist. Again,
the words, " And they that spoil thee
ahall be a spoil," are spoken in be-
half of larael; with regard to whom
it is said, Isaiah, viii. 4, " The spoil of
Samaria shall be taken away before
the king of Assyria;" whose empire
was ehortly after given to be a spoil
to other natioiiii. Jerusalem was still,
after the utter spoiliug of Samaria,
left to be a prey to the Babylonians;
and, last of all, to the Romans, who
were afterwards themselvea, even u
to their capitals, Babylon and Rome,
let\ to be a prey to others, even to
their utter wa.ating, a.a at this day.
Again, of Israel it is said, " For I will
restore health unto thee;" even rais-
iug them a.a from the dead, which, u

we have seen from Ezekiel, ia by the
word of God, &nd " the teetimony of
Jesus, which ia the spirit ofprophecy;"
whil.at of Judah, whoee wound by
the Babylonian W88 grievous, and
who, by the Roman, waa wounded
with the w011Jld of an eaemy, it ia
lllid, " I will cure thee of thy wound."
Such were the thoughta of God
towards them. The words which men
have spoken with regard to them are
referred to u follows : " Becanae
they called thee an Ontcut," even
larael, that seemed to be utterly aban-
doned of their God, and for ever cast
out of hia iDherit&nce. And tbia
other bonae, more near to them 88
they supposed, even the bonae of
Judah, they talked of with utter de-
spite, saying, " Thia Zion, whom no
man aeeketh af\er." Aa it waa be-
fore llllid to the same h0111e, " They
eeek thee not." They court not thy
alli&nce, but rather put thee away
from them, 88 a people offering them-
aelvea to all nati0111. The Jewa have
been, &nd they are a people whom all
JWiona have been eager to turn away
tiom them.
Thus cl11111ly are the inteni!W of
Israel and of Judah bound up qe..
tber in the purpoeea of God. And
thua intimately OODDeeted are the
deetiniea of tile mightiest empires
1rith the fortunes of a people who
have had no 1'eC!lOgDiaed mrletenoe; or
who have been kJJOWB in part cxal.y to
be deapiaed ~d nUected. Like to
them, ia ~He~ wlm took
dieir griefit, and 1lare their IOn'OW8.
Thq are, in the purpole of God, a
holy people. And that tbia ahall be
10 found of the lump, we are .-ured,
in tlW the firat...fruite have been made
holy: a reference to wbich we eeem
to be given upon the opening of the
fifth seal, Rev. vi. ~11. There tM
aoula under the altar, the same who
are aft.erwards described u the sealed
of Judahand hiacompanioua, Rev. vii.
4--8. " The first fruita unto God and
the Lamb,"-eh. xiv. 4, are found, like
die poor widow, crying tobe avenged of
dieir adversaries, saying, "How long,
0 Lord, holy and true, doet diou not
judge and avenge our blood on them
that dwell on the earth?" And they
are acknowledged in holineaa; ac-
cepted in peace. " White robes were
givan to every one of them," although
they had been in the aight of men
olothed in IIICkcloth. And it 11'88 llllid
unto them that they should rest yet
for a little eeeaon, until their fellow-
servants, and their brethren, that ia
of Ephraim and hia oompanioua, that
should be killed 88 they were, should
be fiiliilled. Of this laat oomp&ny, the
promiaed harvest waa to oome, aa
described, Rev. vii. 9-12, aa in die
poeeeeaion of the blessings promised
unto the fathers; and further de-
scribed in twelve lines correspondent
to the twelve tribee, ver. 14-17,
and adverted to, oh. xiv. 14-16; &nd
who were to be killed u the Jewish
martyn, for the word of God·&nd the
teetimony whichthey held. Thepower-
ful operation of the Word, with re-
gard to the lump, or whole bonae of

under the former seal, whil.at the

and, following which, the aceeding
peat army ahall be led back triumph-
antly, under the Great Captain of the
Lord'1 IIoat, into the poalllllion of
their long-loet inheritance. They ahall
be joined together into one rod of
power, and 10 remain in the hand of
the Son of Man. Thill union of the
brethren ia farther intimated when it
ia said, in explanation of the foregoing
type, " Behold, I will take the stick
of Joseph, which is in the hand of
Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel hia
fellows; and will pnt them with him,
even with the atick of Judah; and
make them one stick; and they ahall
be one in mine hand." Alld, in order
to upress still more clearly the open
manifestation and permanent abiding,
they, in their oneneaa, would have in
the hand of the Lord, it ia added,-
" Alld the sticks whereon thou'Wrlteat
shall bein thine hand beforetheireyea."
Thus far with regard to those whom
the Lord ia preparing to e:&erciae
power in hla kingdom; and nut, with
regard to the happy union of the two
hOUII88 under their peaceful dominion.
" Thna IIIith the Lord God, Behold I
will take the children of Israel from
among the heathen, whither they be
gone; and will gather them on every
aide, and bring them into their o'II'Jl

the sceptre ahall be 0118: " neither
ahall they be divided into two king-
doms any more at all." They ahall
be aaftd from all their iciobl unto the
holy service of their 0118 God; eder
the government of their one beloftd
King: to dwell together in tbe one

spoken of thoee under them, ia endeui
from its being said, that the land in
which they shall dwell ia not merely
that given unto Jaoob; and that
wherein their fathers had dwelt; bU
al10 that in which they, and their
ohildren, and their children's children,
shall dwell for ever. Alld again the
unity and permanency of the ecePtre
is alluded to: " Alld iny aervant Da-
'rid ahall be their prince for ever."
And they shall have one mercy seat,
which ahall never be removed. The
covenant of peace made with them
ahall be an everlasting covenant, and
he will place them and multiply them;
and set hia sanctuary in the midat of
them for evermore. Alld not only
shall be thia centre of unity upon
earth; but " My tabel-nacle also shall
be with them." "The tabernacle of
God shall be with men; and He will
dwell with them; and they shall be
his people, and God himself shall be
with them, their God;" or, as it ia here
aaid, " Yea, I will be their God, and
they shall be my people." Alld at the
time Israel ahall be thna judged, and
avenged, and given health and a cure,
they ahall be no more cal1ed Outcast;
or that which no man seeketh after.
" Alld the heathen, or nations, ahall
know that I the Lord do sanctify
Israel, when my sanctuary ahall be in
the midst of them for evermore."
Thna have we -n, from Jer. lCCL
16, 17, that the number, malignity,
and varied attaob of their enemies,
ftnt or Jut, cannot have frnatrated the
purpoeea of God with regard to Israel
and Judah, whose - , although dif.
ferent, are 10 bound up in the revealed
purpoeea of God. As truly - Israel

threatened punishment in a return of
the ills they inflicted upon Israel; so
111rely shall the promised health and
healing take place.
The preparation for this perfect
healing, and for the full avenging, we
have seen under the opening of the
fifth seal, Rev. vi 9-11, where the
Jewish Dl8l'tyrll, slain under Rome
Pagan, are directed to wait until their
brethren, to be slain as not worship-
ping the beast, sbould be joined unto
them; when, together, they shall
reign with Christ in his Millemrial
Kingdom, Rev. xx. 4.
And in the expansion of this seal,
Ezek. xxxvii. 15-28, we have seen
the union of these two cl&81188 of wit-
ne88e8 into one rod of power, or scep-
tre of government, in the hand of
their God. And, connected there-
with, theunion of Judah and Ephraim
to this One God, having one land, one

more particularly regarded the pre-
m"llalioll of larael, this, like its coun-
terpart, v. 10, points to their reatora-
tioA, which was there described as
being to the blessings written in the
names of their capitals, Jerusalem
and Samaria. It would be to the .iglat
of that ~ which can alone be en-
joyed under the .aft leupiflg of the
Shepherd of Israel. Here, ver. 18, 19,
the return is promised to be to the
fulne88 of the blessings promised unto
the fathers. Those promises regarded,
in the one seed Christ, two great ob-
jecta,-the place and the people, in and
to whom the Lord would especially
manifest his goodness. Both of these
are referred to in the text, the places
in v. 18, and the people, v. 19. There
had, as to place, been promised the
double portion to the fathers; for, at
the same time that they were pro-
mised the land whereon they walked,
they were given to look for the hea-
venly city, whose Builder and Maker

is God. The latter portion of the In-
heritance has been re.tervedin Heaven,
until the spirits of the just shall have
their state perfected in glorious bodies,
and their number made complete, by
the harvest of Ephraim being added
to the first-fruits of Judah. But the
earthly part of the Inheritance which
is corruptible, was given to Israel in
the flesh, under a covenant of carnal
ordinances, and the consequence was
that the land became defiled through
their continual disobedience. And
the result was that it hath faded away
from them, as said, Is. xxiv. 4-6,
" The earth mourneth and fadeth
away " " The earth is tkjiled under
the inhabitants thereof.~-" Therefore
hath the curse devoured the earth,
and they that dwell therein are deso-
late: " It was corruptible, defiled, and
had faded away.
But this, although not the inherit-
ance which is incorruptible, undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, is not to be
disregarded. Our God hath made it
matter of promise.
There is a very beautiful progress
marked in the Restoration : First,
tents are mentioned ; next, dwelling-
places; then, the city; and, lastly, the
pali\Ce. This order would seem to in-
dicate that Israel, upon their return,
will, in the first instance, dwell chiefly
in taberni\Cles. Thus Hos. xii. 9,
" And I ·tllat am the Lord thy God
from the Laud of Egypt, will yet
cause thee to dwell in tabernaeles, as
in the days of the solemn feasts." The
crowding of inhabitants into the land,
may occasion their dwelling in tents,
as in the feast of tabernacles; but, in-
dependent of the necessity of the case,
from the scarcity of more 8tlttled
abodes, it will certainly, until the
cities are repaired, be much more
healthy and pleasant in many respects,
to tabernacle upon the mountains of
Israel, than to crowd into the cities.
Afterwards they will of course pro-
ceed to establish their dwelling-places
over the country, according as occa-
sion may require : where a more se-
cure shelter may be given to the in-
1irm; and where the advantages of
education and of social worship, may
be more fully enjoyed. They will take
measures, not only for the moral pu-
rification of the people, bnt also for the
cleansing oftheLand inother respects:
that the cities may be rebuilt in a
manner consistent with the health and
best accommodation ofthe inhabitants.
And the Lord will doubtless assist
them by his judgments; and overrule
even the conV'.Jlsions of nature, as well
as of kingdoms, for the ultimate
blessing of his people. Although overy
other wall shall fall to the ground,
upon the dwelling-places of his chosen
peorle the Lord will now have mercy.
The promise with regard to Jacob,
that the Lord will have mercy upon
his dwelling-places, would seem to in-
timate that danger has .threatened ;
but that they hotve been defended,
"Uponall thegloryshall be a defence...
In order to their being thus defended,
He must be glorified in his people.
They must be made willing to be
emptied of themselves, and to be filled
with His glory. " And the Lord their
God will defend them in that day as
the flock of his people, for they are as
the stones of a crown lifted up as an
ensign upon his Land." They are the
jewels of the crown ofour blessed Re-
deemer;-a preparation is being made
for crowning the King of all the earth.
Now" the city shall be builded upon
her own heap," or, as it mi~ht be ren-
dered, "upon her own little hiii."-
The words seem to imply, that the
very site of the Jerusalem of old is
now to be the site of Jerusalem in
the great restoration. The rubbish
of ages may have been removed, and
the proper foundations laid bare; but
thb hill itself remains, as well as the.
surrounding mountains. Changes may
have taken place so as to dislodge the
pestihnce, and prevent the inhabit-
ants from saying any more, "I am
sick." And thence Jerusalem, reb11ilt
unto the Lord, on her own proper
foundations, shall see peace. '' An<i
they that trust in the Lord shall be
as Mount Zion, which cannot be r&-
moved. buL abideth for ever."
The promise, " And the pnlace shall

~t the ,plendid abodes of lr;inga

be mountains on land, or ialands in

tion. And aa to the inhabitants of the
earth, the 8I;Will shall not now look to
the great ·for deliverance; but, con-
trary to the usual courae of things, the
calamity fint aeize8 upon thote in
po81!e88ion of the dominion, riches,
might, or inll~nce of this world; and
il d81!C8nda to the free man, the least
cared for of all. Beneath, above, and
Bl'Ound them, all threatens deatruc-
tlon; yet far greatar evil ia dreaded:
110 that to the very mountains and
rooks, that are reeling around them,
they say, " Fall on us, and hide ue
from the face of Him that siUeth on
the throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb; for the great day of his wrath
ia come, and who shall be able to
stand?"
.Af\er this, in tracing the line of
mercy, correspondent to that of judg-
ment,in these five eeals, we have given
us in ch. vii. an acoount of the sealing
of the elect number, the first--fruita of
Israel; and afterwards ia a view given
of the innumerable multitude ; the
general harvest; when come out into
open manifestation before the throne,
thoae that have fulfilled unto tl;lem the
promi8811 made unto the fathers. .As
it was promised to .Abraham, they are
" a multitude which no one could
number;" And they are Jacob, they,
have overcome, and have palms in their
banda. And they are Isaac. They
expre88 themselves ~oicingly; say-
ing, " Salvation to our God that sitteth
upon the throne, and to the Lamb for
ever and ever." They rejoice ex-
ceedingly before that throne at which
the nations tremble. He that sitteth
thereon hath complied with the call
of his people: "Give ear, 0 Shepherd
of Israel; thou that leadest Joseph
like a flock; thou that dwellest be-
tween the cherubims, shine forth!"
And he hath shined forth, and re-
-.led the darkness in which his
~ .hav.e. heeD· wauderillg; :rt
which they had lost themselves. But
although they had forgouan their Fa-
ther's house, they 'were pot forgotten
of God. And 110 an answer ia pre-
pared to the question aa to what
people this really is, that now make
&11Ch an appearance in the world's hia-
tary, and are the moat intimately con-
nected with the Lord's ~use. Can it be
that they have been entirely over-
looked by the eye of Omniaoience; aa
contemplating the future progress of
his cause; and the instrumentality of
110wing the good seed of his word over
the whole habitable globe? But can
they indeed be the people formed for
him~, to show forth his praise?
Hath he, after all, chosen Israel, and
not cast them away? How then have
they come into their present position?
These had been subjected to great
tribulation; having been found filthy,
they were condemned: but justified
through faith in him who died for their
sins, they are accepted before the
throne. And having washed their
robea, theynow serve him continually,
aa an holy priesthood, in the temple
of their God. And having been
brought out of all their dark per-
plexity and trouble, they are for ever
Joined unto their God, and shall never
be moved more. These are they who
had been once given a famine of the
word of God; and to whom the waters
typified by that of Jacob's well, had
been denied; and who had been driven
ahelterle88 out of the land of their in-
heritance, exposed to the scorching
heat of the tyrant empires of earth,
without knowing the better provision
made for them by the King of Israel.
But He who leadeth Joseph like a
flock, hath led them out into a wealthy
place; and hath fed them, in the ex-
ercise of his almighty power, and
lamblijte tenderness. And he hath
led them to perennial springs of the
most refi:eahing joy; and now they
see clearly: no longer do they see aa
through a glass darkly; or as looking
with eyes bedimmed with tears: for
God shall wipe away all tears from
thair eye&; and in his light they sl;l:ill

The circUIDitances connected with
the earthquake referred to at the
opening of the Sixth Seal; and al8o
the state of Israel upon the promised
restoration, as being the same with
thoee described by Jeremiah as above:
-theee circumatancea form the suQject
of the next portion of Ezekiel, ch.
:uxviii xx:xix. The King of the
North, the Chief Prince, or Prince of
Rosh (Russia), of Meeech (Moscow),
and Tubal (Tobolsk), has been sup-
posed to point to one occupying the
position of the Emperor of RuBBia;
who gathers with him Persia, Ethi-
opia, and Libya, which, with Gomer
and Togarmah of the north quarters,
added to his own patrimony of all
the R1188ias, seem to make a whole
circlearound the land oflsrael : which,
at the time spoken ofwill be found in
the poseell8ion of a power such as
England, worthy of having prepared
against it the greatest armament; and
this, it would seem, shall be both upon
land and water, Dan. xi. 40. He will
also make II. twofold attack; one upon
the land ofIsrael, brought back from
the sword, and dwelling safely all of
them; and when he shall be like a
cloud to cover the land. But, beside
this attack on the land, " It shall also
come to pass at the same time, shall
things come into his mind;" the many
great cauees of grudge he has against
his powerful rival, 88 interfering in be-
half of the Poles, and perhaps of the
Jews ; some of whom they may have
conveyedtotheland, and givena eettle-
ment therein; free from the yoke of
their mthless Pharoah-like oppreBBOr,
the King of the North; who has the
pretext of coming up to claim either
his runaway subjects, or the land for
thoee of the same people still under
his sway. It may be, that, grown
weary of being obliged to smooth the
tyrant frown into the smile of apology
to other powers, he will think of no-
thing less than the annihilation of his
rival. He shall think an evil thought;
" I will go up to the land of unwalled
villages; I will go to them that are
at rest; that dwell safely." The
inhaDitants ot theee ia1&uda, and their
offshoots in other parts of the world
areall ofthem88 it weredwelling with-
outwalls; and havingtotheircitiesnei-
ther bars nor gates. He comes to make
a spoil ofIsrael, and to take the prey of
Judah, 88 having been gathered out of
the nations, and got cattle, and dwell-
ing in the midst of the land. And the
land will have perhaps become a place
ofconsiderable mercantile importance;
so that Sheba and Dedan, from the
east, will join the merchants of Tar-
shish from the west, in questioning
the motivee that have led to this
mighty movement. Israel shall have
been dwelliug safely in the land when
in the latter days this invasion shall
take place from one who, it is very
probable, will now propose himself 88
the promised Messiah, to whom be-
lougs the universal monarchy: and
upon which he shall seem to eeize
without hindrance. Then shall be
that dreadful earthquake, spoken of,
not only in Rev. vi., but throughout
the prophets: "My fury shall come
up in my face. For in my jealousy,
and in the fire of my wrath, have I
spoken, Surely in that day there shall
be a great shaking in the land of Is-
rael; so that the fishes of the sea, and
the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts
of the field, and all creeping things
that creep upon the earth, and all the
men that are upon the face of the
earth, shall shake at my presence."
The Lord himeelf shall be revealed
from heaven in awful llll\iesty, to
rescue his captive people, and redeem
his purchased throne from the hand of
the enemy. And no obstruction shall
withstand his arm ofpower. The very
mountains shall be thrown down, and
the steep places shall fall ; and every
wall shall fall to the ground. Nei-
ther shall the Lord want weapons of
war. Not ouly shall the earth reel
beneath them; but the sword, mutual
slaughter, and pestilence, shall pre-
vail around ; and, from above, an
overflowing rain, hailstones, fire and
brimstone, shall be rained upon him.
Thus will the Lord 881lotify, or eet
himeelf apart, as He who hath the
power to take poBIIflllion of the king-

dom. And He will be known in the
eyes of many nations; and they shall
know that He is the Lord. When
this great conflict hath taken place,
and also the fire that shall be aen.t
upon Magog and on them that dwell
carelessly in the isles, Israel shall
know the name of the Lord-proba.-
bly that Name, which, although writ-
ten, no man knew but He him-
eel£ And the nations around shall
know, that He, the Lord, is the Holy
One of Israel This is the great day
spoken of in prophecy with regard to
the destruction of the enemy. It will
involve the case of both Israel and
Judah ; of both the people and the
land ; of both the appointed capital
of the earth, and the dominion under
the whole heaven. It was a desperate
llta.ke. " Behold, it is oomeI and it is
done! saith the Lord God. This is
the day wherecf I have spoken."
Then we are informed, that 80 nu-
merdlls had been the armament, that
they shall burn the weapons of war
seven years; and sogreatthe alaughter,
that they shall be seven months in
burying the slain. It is the great
supper of God to all the fowls of
heaven, described as takiDgplace, Rev.
m, immediately before the millennial
gl~. And so also ii is said, " And I
will set my gl~ among the nationa;
and all the nations shall see my judg-
ment that I have executed, and my
band that I have laid upon them. So
the house of Israel shall know that I
am the Lord eMir God from that day
and forward." And the nations shall
know wherefore the Lord had 80 dealt
with Israel, both as to putting them
away, and hiding his face from them:
and be warned.thereby; and be also
enoouraged to place their entire oon-
fidenoe in God, as a God of tmth. He
both brings again the oap$i'rity ofJa.-
pob's tents, and lte has mercy upon
the whole house of Israel, so as to
restore to them, as we saw from Jere-
miah, their dwelling places. They
·had formerly dwelt safely there, and
thall do 80 again. They had been led
into captivity among the heathen; but
d
are now gathered unto their own land,
and none of them are left in captivity
as heretofore; neither will the Lord
hide his face any more from them.
For;not only has the Lordnmr ponred
out His Spirit upon the whole house
of Israel out of the land; but also
upon the house of Israel in the land.
· And so, illuminated, justified, and
sanctified, they shall be given to re-
joice in the Lord, and he shall joy.
over his people for ever.
Thus have we seen, from the Sixth
Security, Jer. xxx. ·18, 19, that the
restoration is to be of both the tents
of Judah and the dwelling-places of
Israel; of both the city wb.ich is to be
built up, and the house of God that is
to come down from heaven:-thatit is
to be to the rejoicing, written in the
name Isaac, and to the multiplicity
promised in the name Abraham, and
the glorification seen in vision by J a-
oob at Bethel; where also his name
was changed to IsraeL Now as such
a restoration never has as yet taken
place, we may rest assured that it is
yet to be. . ' '

shall they sing? How shall they de-
ol&re his praise ? That union of the
divine with the human nature is in-
efFable I ·.That love puseth know-
ledge I Let, then, expreseive silence
muse his praise, until the wondering
minds ot' even the heavenly host be-
come collected into song.
The riches ot' Christ &re unsearch-
able. He hath a name written which
noman knew but he himselt': but that
name shall be declared, when he ap-
proaches to claim p<l881l88ion. The
angels desire to look into the riches of
wisdom which &re contain8d in th&t
name, and may well be struck into
silent 118tonishmentwhen the develop-
ment takes place. But how much
more may man, having that name re-
vealed to him as his own, exclaim, 118
in Psalm xi., " Many, 0 Lord my God,
Thy wonderful works ! Thou haat
done I and thy thoughts to us-W&rd !
They cannot be reckoned up in order
unto thee. I would decl&re and speak."
-But as if oonscions that expreBBion
would utterly fail in attempting to
utter all the loving-kindnesses and
tender mercies manifested in that new
name, it is added, " They &re more
than can be numbered."
Upon the opening of the seventh
seal, Rev. viii. 1, it is said, '' There
W118 silence in heaven about the space
of halt' an hour." Those who had in
mfFering obedience waited for the sal-
vation of the Lord had sung the song
ot' redeeming Jove, as they ascended
in the resurrection, appointed to be
kings and priests unto God, and to
reign with Christ on the earth. .And
the nuptial song had been sung by the
angels around them, in the glory ot'
their Hnsba.nd's mansion,theirFatber'e
house, which had come down for them
out ot' heaven : but all the while,
Ps. lxv., " Praise is silent t'or thee, 0
God, in Zion." .And yet, Is. xlv. 23,
"The Lord hath sworn by himselt';
the word had gone out of his mouth in
righteousness, and shall not return,
that unto him every knee shall bow,
and every tongue confess." And,
Phil. ii. 9-11, to Christ the Son,
to the glory ot' God the Father, this
vow shall nowbe performed. " 0 thou
that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all
flesh come."-Each t'or himselt'makes
confeBBion, as in Ps. lxv. 3, " Iniquities
prevail against me." But looking unto
Him who hath prevailed t'or them, so
to crush the head of Satan under the
feet of the seed of thewoman, they say
collectively, " Our transgressions--
thou shalt purge them away." And
looking to the Head, whose name is
Wonderful, through whom this anoint-
ing ot' power cometh upon the whole
body, they My (v. 4,) without naming
the name unse&rchable, " Blessed-

v. 5-8, there is a contemplating the

throughout the Lord's inheritance the
" olive trees ehall drop their fatneu:
yea, and all the trees of the wood
shall rejoice:" an abundant produce
from them shall "drop even upon the
pumres of the wilderness; and the
little hills ehall be girded with joy, in
the delights they ehall make to flow
out ou every side." Then, also, " the
putures ehall be clothed with flocks;
the valleys covered over with corn,"
and those that bear this harvest home
" ehall shout for joy;" and they that
tend those flocks "ehall also aing."-
y ea, every creature upon earth ehall
be heard, saying, " Blessing, and ho-
nour, and glory, and power be unto
Him that sitteth upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb for ever and ever."-
Then shall righteousness look down
from heaven with delight-yea, with
listening delight, to this new song upon
earth; nor may it be a stretch of ima-
gination to suppose, that even the song
of angels in heaven shall, for a short
season, be hushed into silent admira.-
tion of the glory that ehall then be
made to cover the earth-at the mar-
vellous grace, which, yet consistently
with the sternest justice, has thus been
bestowed upon rebellious man.
The scene we have been oontem-
plating, or rather the great preparation
for this burst of song, which is as yet
so silent in the appointed place of
praise, is given us in the conclud-
ing part of Ezekiel's prophecy, eh.
ld..-xlviii., where we have, first, a de-
soription of the Lord's house, in which
his praise shall be thus sung : with
provision both for the singers, who
shall lead the song in the inner court;
and also as to the priests, the sons of
righteousness, who ehall come near to
serve at the altar of the Lord, ch.
xl.-xlii. Then the return of the
glory of the God ofIsrael is described;
even of Him who ehall come in the
glory of his Father, and inhabit the
praises ofIsrael, ch. xliii. 1-12. Then
of the appointments as to the altar
and sacrifices, to commemorate the
great work of righteousness, upon the
ground of which work of righteous-
118811, this Prince of Peacedoth reign in
the midst of his redeemed people ;
as well as with regard to the Prince
of the people, who, in his actings shall
also keep in lively remembrance the
great traneaction of the Son's ap-
proaching unto the Father, and ob-
taining the inheritance, that he might
give of his own for a perpetual pos-
session unto the sons and daughters
ofhimself, the second Adam.
We have here also the particular
duties, both of the priesthood and of
the prince, in administering righteous-
ness to the people, as well as in com-
memorating the great work of righ-
teousness,performedtowardsthedivine
Majesty, that He who had served as a
Priest might now reign as King in the
glory of his Father, ch. xliii.-xlvi.
The Lord's peculiar portion of the
Inheritance having been thus set apart
in the midst of the land, for his house
and city, and priesthood and prince,
then our attention is directed to that
lively representation of the goodneu
of the Lord, that shall at that time
flow forth from his great purpose of
love, to bless the whole earth. The
type of which blessing is given in that
river of God, which shall be full of
water, that shall flow forth from the
house ofthe Lord,to water thevalleyof
Shittim, Joel. iii. 18.- The living
waters that ehall go out from Jeruae-
lem, Zeeh. xiv. 8, in a full perennial
stream, augmenting in its course,
and which being brought out into the
waters of the Deed Sea, ehall heal
them: so that fish shall be there
as the fish of the Great Sea, exceeding
many. - This river, brought out
into the desert, shall cause it to be
abundant in beauty and fruitfulness:
there growiDg on either side of it all
trees for meat; whose leaf ehall be
unfading; and whose fruit ehall never
be exhausted : the richest fruit for
meat ; and their leaves shall be for
medicine : so that therein a le110n
ehall ever be read, with regard to the
tree of life, which is in the midst of
the paradise of God:-of that reviving
virtue, flowing from Him whose blood
hath been taken into the sanctuary of
God: ch. xlvii. 1-12.

Then the bonnda ol Israel's pecu-
liar Inheritance are desoribecl, u
reaohing on the north side &om the
Great, or Mediterranean Sea, along by
D&III8ICU8 towards Hauran; and then
the east side,from Hauran to the East
Sea; and then on the south side, from
Tamar in the wilderness, to the Me-
diterranean Sea; along which shall be
the border on the west Bide. Although
the Lord shall have his pecnliar por-
tion in the midtt of the land; and Is-
rael his in the midat of the earth: yet
neither shall the Lord the leae inh.erit
all nations, nor Israel cease to fill the
Csoe of the world with fruit: encom-
JIIIIIling all natioDe with blessing, 88
well 88 for being a glory unto the
Lord in the midst of all the Gentiles,
whom alsoit W88 promised they should
inherit. .And u the Lord's house is
to be an house of prayer for all
people, and u lerael shall be fol-
lowers of God 88 dear ohildren; they
shall make their land a home for all
people: who, from year to year, shall
come upto worship the King, the Lord
of Hoeta, and to keep the feast of
tabernaclee:-nUoioing together in the
1Ulity of brotherly love; and in holy
reverence towards their King; and
outwardly expreeeing in acts of true
devotion, and joyful fellowship, their
hearts' obedie~~ce to these W'o great
commandments, love to God and love
to man, the law of this blessed king-
dom of the glorified Messiah:- Thus
accordingly love shall be shown by
the children of Ierael to the strangers:
"They shall have Inheritancewith yon
among the tribes of Ierael. .And it
shall oome to paee that in what tribe
the stranger sojo~eth, there shall ye
give him his Inheritance, eaith the
Lord God." Thus shall the Inherit-
ance of Israel be;-not for selfish gra-
tification, but for the communication
of blessing unto all, ch. xlvii. 13-23.
Then we have the order in which
the tribei!hips shall lie in stripes, 88 it
were, eastward and westward: begin-
Ding with Dan ou the north aide, and
so proceeding with Asher, and Naph-
tali, and Manaaeeh, and Ephraim, and
Reuben, and Judah, to the north of
the Holy Portion, for the Temple and
the Priesthood, and the city, and the
prinee. .And then, on the south side
of this holy oblation, the tribeahipe are
appointed ol Benjamin, and Simeon,
and Isaachar, and Zebnlun, and Gad.
" This is the land that ye shall divide
by lot unto the children of Ierael for
Inheritance: and these are their por-
tions, eaith the Lord God." The divi-
sion of the tribeehipe is not that which
was when Ierael were previously in
the land: neither is the description
correspondent to that which is pro-
phesied ol the tn'bes by Jacob, as to
what w88 to befall them in the last
days: the application of which pro-
phecy, as well 88 that of Moeea, must
be looked for elsewhere ; and may
serve for the reoognition of the tribes
in their present localities, 88 in dia-
persion.
The Btretching outofthe tnDeehipl,
in peaceful linea, aeema to indioate
that they are~ together,not that
each maygather'itsolfup in individual
Btrength, 88 for eon1lict, bnt spread
itaelf out to the uttermoet for inter-
communion; and 88 ifto embrace the
globe from the eaat even unto the
west. Reuben, whose by birth was
the birthright, is plaoed between
Joseph, whogot by adoption the birth-
right, and Judah who obtained the
dominion. This may express the for-
giving grace ol the Father of Ierael;
and the courteous affection with which
his children shall dwell together in
unity near the courts of his honse.
The removal of the C1l1'88 is moet
atrikingly manifested in the case of
Judah, who ia, of the three, nearest to
the house of the Lord, in which they
shall now indeed praise the Lord, and
in truth bow the knee to Him whom
formerly they rejected. .And the
Lord's choosing his portion between
those of Judah and Benjamin, who
previoualyjoined in putting Him away
from them, caating him out of their
city, is indeed a lesson of forgiving
grace. The fnlneu of the earthly
bleseing of Judah md Benjamin, 88
given by Jacob and Moses, remain&
to be poueaaed ; and it ahall be

peace, which had so long been beheld
in vision, be realized, in .the sight of
the Prince of Peece; who is abo the

Jenualem upon earth, shall reflect
the beanty and the bl~ ofthat
Jenualem above, in which the Lord
and hia glorified bride ahall have
their IICCU8tomed abode, although Im-
manuel's place of meeting with man
npon the earth will be the city in the
midst of the earth; and Ullto which
all ll8tions ahall ftow. The pte& of
the 811lthly city are, like thoee of the
heav&Dly, after the D8ID88 ofthe tnDe&
ofhnlel: only Reuben is the first on
thepiea of the earthly city, aa he is
abo them01'8centnll tribe aatohiapor-
t;ionin the lap.d: whilst in thehe&ftllly
city, Joseph has the first plaoe; he
being tbe first of the three on the e&st
side, which in Rev. ui.are mentioned
befOl'8 the three on the north side:
which north side is the first mentioned
in Ezekiel's desoription of the 811lthly
city, ad the first ofwhich is Reuben.
These, in the earthly city and land
of lmle1, are llrBel aocording to the
11esh; bnt given epiritual life. They
are the children 116 not having viai~
upon them the sin oftheir fathera. The
Lord hath forgiven theiriniquity; and
will remember their sin no mo.re. And
thus it is that Reuben is here restored
to hia polition; and thus has the Lord
eome to inherit hisportion with Judah
and Benjamin in the holy land; and
thus ha8 he cho88D Jenualem again.
In the heav&Dly Jenualem it is dif-
ferent: T&ere men are not only given
spiritual life, but glorified bodies.
Thoee who are there are, like the
children of Joseph, children of adop-
tion: and there aocordingly hia name

WE have now taken a view of theM
118Ven seals, or securities, 1188uring of
the reatoration of the kingdom to 1.&-
rael. These securities, aa given Jere-
miah xn.. 8-22, II88UJ'e us, that,
just 118 truly aa the King hath been
l'llised up to them, ahall the people be
ilelivered.-Aa truly aa no restoration
hitherto, baabeen to the eujoyment of
perfect and pennanent ~ 80 truly
ia tha promised restoration yet to
come.-Aa truly aa othernations have
periahed ahall Israel be preaerved.-
As truly aa Israel have been utterly
lost in thelll88lves, ahall they be found
surrounded by the bleesing of the
Lord.-Aatrulyaa other nationsbave
IOUght their destruction, ahall these
other nations be destroyed, and Israel
be given health andhealing.-As truly
118 no restoration hitherto baa been to
the fnln888 of the bl888ing promised
unto their fathers, 80 r.ruly ia the pro-
mised restoration yet to t.ake place.-
Aa truly aa their Governor hath pro-
ceeded from the midst of them, and
been caused to draw near, 80 truly
ahall the deliverance take place, when
they ahall be his people, and God
himself shall be with them, and be
their God.
It baa been eeen, how, in the open-
ing of the seals, (Rev. vi-viii. 1), we
had presented to us the opening of
these seven securities. Christ, the
King, having been l'llised up, and hav-
ing had a crown given unto Him, is,
at the opening of the first seal, seen
going forth to the full deliverance,-
conquering and to conquer. At the
Qpening of the second seal, there waa
!Ml8D the going forth of the Great
Sword against theenemies ofthe King,
preparing the way for Israel's peace-
able reatoration. At the opening of
the third seal, we heanl of a reeerva.-
tion of a aufficiency for tha preaerved
of Iarae1, in the midst of surrounding
jndgmenL At the opening of the
fourth seal, the utterly mined condi•
tion of the people, on the fourth part
of the earth, ia described : but Iarae1,
thus mined at home, were, under
other naJD8I, to be filling the face of
the world with fruiL At the opening
of the fifth seal, the Jnartyred Jewiah
believers were heard crying for juat
jndgment to be lllt8C1lted; and it is
promised to take place when their
brethren that ahould be killed, a& they
were, ehould be fulfilled. Then will
God bind up the breach of his people,
and. heal the stroke of their wound.
At the opening of the sixth seal there
Wa& beheld that great earthquake,
which shall IICCOIDpany that remark-
able change on the earth, when shall
be completely fulfilled the promi-
made unto the fathers, aa deacribed in
the case of the rejoicing multitude.
At the opening of the seventh seal,
there waa silence in heaven about the
11paoe ofhalf an hour: aa if in prepr.-
ration for that triumphant and uni-
versal burst of eong with which an
answer ahall be given to the question,
" Who ia this that engaged his heart
to approach unto me, a&ith the Lord?"
We have also eeen that these seven
seals or securities (Jer. xn.. 8-22)
thus opened (Rev. vi vii. viii) have &
farther expansion given them in Ezek.

described the evil by which all right

to the iuheritance was' forfeited by the
people ofIsrael. And then the Blllva-
tion by David their king, tpe plant of
nmown that was to be raised np unto
them, ch. :axili. 21-83 ; :uxiv.
Then, BeCOndly, there W86 deecribed
the Great Sword upon Edom, prepa-
ratory to the peaceable restoration of
Israel, ohap. x:uv. x:uvi. 1- 15.
Thirdly, the preservation of IBI'Ul,
through all their wanderings, unto a
full deliverance frQPl famine, when
1181lctified from among the heathen,
and made holiness unto the Lord, ch.
x:uvi. 16--38. Fourthly, Israel's
lost oondition in themselves, aa spread
like dry bones in the open valley
through the wasting of such judg-
ments 86 those described upon the
opening of the fourth seal; and from
which destruction Israel are here de-
scribed 86 being raised up, through
the instrumentality of the word and
the spirit of the Lord, ch. xxxvii.
1-14. Fifthly, the binding up of the
breach between the two houses of
Israel; when, under the children of
the resurrection, Israel shall enjoy
the promiaea made unto the fathers.
Then shall be completed the one rod
of power, supplied by Judah and the
children of Israel, his companions;
and by Ephraim, and tJll tM kOUie of
I wad, his companions. Then the fa-
then themselves shall live with their
children and their children's children,
v. 15-28. Sixthly, the great earth-
quake and the accompanying circum-
stances of destruction to the wicked,
which shall accompany the great and
final restoration of Israel to the land,
when they shall enjoy the fulness of
the blessings promised unto the fa-
thers, oh. xxxviii. xxxix. Seventhly
and laatly, we have seen the vast pre-
paration for the Redeemer's praise to
be sung upon earth : the silence of
:which preparation is noted at the
opening of the seventh seal, and the
aubjeot of which is called for in the
seventh seonrity: so are the abundant
means for its celebration described i1J
the last portion of Ezekiel's propheoy,
ch. :xl-xlviii.
. It is worthy of remark, that these
seven seals are 8till further unfolded,
and that in the same order, in the end
ofleaia.h, ch. lxi-!xvi.
Firat, we have, in Oh. !xi. lxii., an
unfolding of that whioh is referred to
in the opening of the First Seal, Rev.
vi. 1, 2, where the Rider upon the
white horse is represented 86 going
forth, conquering and to conquer.
The proclamation of the King, invit-
ing to a participation in the joys of
his coming kingdom, is sent forth,
commencing with our Lord's peraonal
ministry; 86 here, v. 1, " The Spirit
of the Lord God is upon me, beceuse
He hath anointed me to preach good
tidings unto the meek. He hath sent
me to bind up the broken hearted; to
proclaim liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison to the bound,
to proclaim the acoeptable year of the
Lord; and the day of. Tengeance of
onr God; to comfort all that mourn."
Thus did the joyful message of Blllva-
tion, from, and through, and to, their
King, go forth unto the lost house of
Israel: that He, by their blissful sub-
mission to Him, might be glorified.
Their white robes of righteousness,
procured from Him, and admission
into the priestly office, for which they
are thus attired; their being given the
double portion of the hirthrigbt bless-
ing; the brightness of the light ofBlll-
vation they were to enjoy,andmanifest
to all; and the intimate communion
with the Lord of glory, which they
are to be given, when the triumph
shall be complete, are there beautifully
sketched. And then the joyful mes-
sage of the present dispensation hav-
ing been proclaimed unto the end of
the world, ~he words to the daughter
of Zion are, " Behold thy Blllvation
cometh 1 Behold his reward is with
Him, and his work before Him." His
18ints whom he shall bring with Him,
and Israel are the work of His banda,
whom He hath been preparing 86 the
Jl80Ple over whom He shall more
especially reign. " And they shall
call them the holy people, the re-
deeniecj. of the Lord; and thou shalt
be called, Sought out, a city not for-
BIIken."

Next, COI'l'lllpOilclent to the opeaing
ofthe Seaond Seal, at which there waa
seen going forth a l"8d horae, to the
rider upon whick there waa given a
great sword, we have deacribed in
cb. hiii. hiY. the case of Edom, whole
"'"Y name me8D8 red orbloody. The
lllaughw of the Edomitea, under the
name of Jews, at the destruction of
Jeruaalem, we have already spoken
of. As in the former portion, oh.
br.i. lxii. the garmenta of a&lvation,
which are white, were frequently al-
luded to, 80 here we have described
the redness ofthe raiment of him who,
at the time alluded to, began to exe-
cute judgment upon his enemiea.-
Next we hear of the Lord's great
&oodness towards the house of Israel.;
of Hia mercies, of the multitude of
Hia loving kindnesses. Israel. had
been lost sight of by men; but He re-
coguized them, and said, " Surely they
are My People; children that will not
lie; 80 He waa" emphatically " their
S&viour." Then his sympathy with
them, and tenderness over them, ia de-
aeribed. Although having lost their
genealogical connection with .A.bra.-
:IJam, they recognize themselves as the
tribes of the Lord's inheritance. They
are as yet out of the land when this
recognition takes place; and there ia
an earnest expectation of the near
coming of the Lord. Their cities in
the laud are as yet a wilderness;
Zion is a wilderness; Jerusalem a de-
solation. The restoration to perfect
peace hath not yet taken place; but
the Rider upon the red horse hath
prepared the way. The great sword
hath cleared the land, and widely
spread its power in the countries
around.
The opening of the Third Seal pre-
18nted a black horae, with the Rider
having a pair of balau088 inhis hand;
and there was heard a voice, in midst
of the four liYing creatures, reserving
a bare 11lfficienoy for the remnant to
be preserved in the midst of destruc-
tive famine. Correspondent to this ia
ch. hv., where aft.er the appointed
judgment ia written; and the Lord
hath threatened to bring upon the
Jewa their iniquity, &lld the iniqllityof
their fathers (all which 0&1118 upon
that evil generation who oruoified the
Lord of Glory), ltill the Lord in
wrath remembera mercy; ltill He will
not destroy them all, but promises to
briDg a seed out of Jacob, and out of
Judah an inheritor of his moantains.
But of a oertaiD o1al8 he aaith, " Be-
hold my aemmta shall eat, but ye
shall be hllll8f1; behold my 18rV&Dta
lhall. drink, but ye shall be thirety1
behold my aemmta lhall.rejoice,butye
shall be ashamed., And, having pro-
mised preservatioo for 101118, in the
midst of wastingdestruction toothers,
the prcphet proceeds to d.escn"be that
bleuedness which Israel shall enjoy
when the reprcaoh of famine lhall. fur
ever be taken from them; when they
ahall build 11oU888 and hUlabit them,
and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit
of them ; when his elect lhall. long
enjoy the work of their hands. The
days of man shall then be as thoss of
a tree. A child shall he be thought
thet dies at the age of a hundred
years; and he that dies at that early
age shall be thought to have been out
off by judgment. They shall have
everything supplied that they need,
and nothing shall have power to hurt
them as heretofore. " They shall noe
hurt nor destroy in all my holy moun-
tains, eaith the Lord.'' As truly as
other nations have perished, shall
Israel. th111 be preserved unto the
fulness of the blessing promised.
At the opening of the Fourth Seal
there was seen the going forth of the
pale or livid..green horae, rep~ting
that utwly corrupted and rninoua
state deacribed ch. hvi. 1---4, when
the Lord, forsaking the h0W18 that had
been built for him, and the IIIIClifioet
there otrered, turns from the proud
eelf-righteo111 worshipper, to him that
ia of a poor and of a contrite apizit,

there was beam the cry t1 those de-:
voted to destructioB. And the pro-
mise of preeent peace and future
reoompence was gnmtea UDto them,
such as is llere given, ch. lrri. 5-9.
When the elect ofthe houee of Israel,
the brethren of the Jewish martyrs,
are eoinplete, the Lord will give re-
ward unto them that fear him. And
theee are they who are thus addret!aed,
" Heal' the word of ~e Lord, ye that
tremble at his word; Your brethren
that hated you, that cast you out for
my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be
~lorified : but he shaJl appear to1our
Joy, and they shall oo ashamed. A
"Yoice was heard from the city and the
temple, in the fulfilment o( the judg-
ments predicted thereupon by o~
Lord. And as assuredly shall yet oo
heard the voice of the Lord that ren-
dereth recompence to his enemies.
And as traly also shall He do great
things for his people, both as to the
bringing them forth, and supplying
them with all needful blessing.
At the opening of the Sixth Seal,
there was beheld the great earthquake,
which shall aceompany the deliver-
ance of Israel, and their restoration to
the land: when shall oo fully enjoyed
thefulnessoftheblessingpromisedllDto
the fathers. And so they are here in-
.vited to partake of this fulness of joy,
" Rejoice with Jerasalem, and be glad
with her,all ye that love her. Rejoice
for joy with her, all ye that mourn
for her." Thoee who have this sym-
pathy with Jerusalem shall be foun~
her children, shall partake of her rich
oonsolation and the abundance of her
glory. It shall be found that the
glory of the Gentiles is hers. And
they shall be comforted by the Lord
himeelf, and that in Jerusalem. The
blindneBB in part which hath happened
to Israel shall depart; and they shall
eee, and then their heart shaJl rejoice:
andtheyshallalsobestronginthe Lord.
Their bones shall flourish as an herb;
and, at the same time, that the band
of the Lord shall be known toward
his eervants, his indignation shall
be known towards his enemies, as
is described upon the opening of
this lixth eeal, Rev. vi. 12 - 1'I i
"For behold the Lord will come
with fire, and with his ~ like
a whirlwind, to render his anger
with fury, md his rebukes with
flames of tire ; for by fire and by
sword," as is deacn"bed in the oorre-
spondent portion of Ezekiel, " will the
Lord plead with all flesh, md the
elain of the Lord shall be mll!ly."
At the opening of the Se.enth Seal,
there was silence in heaven about the
space of half ll!l hour,- the llilellt
preparation for that umversal bmet of
song to the Redeemer, the prepat'&tion
for which is here noted, in the cj.e-
struotion of the mere fOrmal worship-
ers, with the openly profane: and
In his arranging it, 80 that, not only
a few eelfiah Jews shall be blessed in
the land, but 80 as that all nations
and tongues shaJl oome· and see the
Lord's glory. The Lord did purpoee
to eend the esoaped unto the nations,
with the design that they should de-
clare his glory among the Gentiles.
And they shaJl preeent an oft'ering
of their brethren unto the Lord 011t of
all nations: and he will also take of
them, even of the ontoast houee Qf
Israel will he take, for priests and rei
Levites. For as the new heavens and
the new earth which he will make,
shaJl remain, so will they be given
an assurance that this shall be, by
their eeed and their name remaining,
notwithstanding the impossibility of
this to all human appearance.
And now shall the song be sung,
now shaJl the worship be performed,
" And it shall come to pass, from one
new moon to another, and &om one
Sabbath to another, shaJl all flesh
come to wunhip before the Lord."
And this shall be upon this earth:
for of that time it ill said, " And they
shall go forth, and look upon the car-
casee of the men that have trans-
gressed against me: for their wmn
shaJl not die, neither shall their fire
be quenched, and they shall be an
abhorring unto all flesh." God will
thus give eviden.
oe ofhis hatred of sin;
and prave that it is no vain thing to
defY the Almighty, at the same time

that he Ia mOBt abundant in his mercy
to all then living upon the earth.
Thna, complete have we found the
witne88 of the three great prophets of
the Lord to his mercy and his judg-
ment: and the testimony of Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, we have found
opened, 88 was promised, in the con-
cluding book of the New Testament.
And it may be observed, that what
baa been thus opened by our Lord in
heaven, was sketched by him when
upon earth, as Ia recorded in the first
book of the New Testament, Mat.
xxiv. 3-14.
We find there the Lord's disciplea
asking him respecting the time of the
threatenedjudgment and the promised
mercy ; when the things would be
which he had predicted respecting Je-
rusalem and the temple ; and what
would be the aign of his coming; and
they also asked regarding the end of
the world. Now thla last question
our Lord answers first, v. 4-14. Af-
terwards he answers as to the ftgrl
of his coming, v. 15-31; and lastly
as to the timetDhen the things, respect-
ing the destruction of the temple,
would be fulfilled, which time he takes
~on to contrast with the day of
his coming, v. 32-41.
In giving his first answer, that re-
specting tha end of the world, he
sketches the subjects contained in the
opening of the seven aeala.
Firat, He, the true MeBBiah, the
King who was to be raised up unto
Israel, warns against the being de-
ceived by any one coming in his
name, and saying, " I am Christ."
He will!imMfcome. The very Jesus
who waa taken up into heaven, shall
ao come in like manner 88 he went.
Neither were they to be carried away
by the multitude of those who might
.be deceived, but prove faithful unto
their King, who had thus faithfully
warned them of the dangers to which
their allegiance would be expoaed.
Then, as the red horae, and the
mutual slaughter, and the great sword,
were spoken of under the l!eCOnd aea!,
so here our Lord next forewarns of
those meana whereby the land was to
be cleared of his enemies, the profess.
ing Jews. " An.d ye aball hear of
wars and rumours of ware. See that
ye be not troubled, for all must come
to pasa ; but the end ia not yet: for
nation aball rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom."
Asunder thethirdseal,theblackhorse
and the pair of balances in the hand
of his rider, betokened the judgment
ofscarcity, when bread would be care-.
fnlly dealt out by weight ; so here,
after having mentioned the mutual
slaughter of the l!eCOnd seal, our Lord
says, " And there aball be famine."
In the midst of this want, a bare suf-
ficiency, as we have seen, was to be
reserved for Israel.
Then, fourthly, as the pale horse
had Death or Pestilence as his rider,
and as hell followed with him, so next
our Lord speaks of pestilences and ·
earthquakes in divers places, and con-
cludes thla portion of the prophecy
with saying, " All these are the begin-
ning of sorrows." The disciples were
thus forbid to expect that the end of
the world was to be at the destruction
of Jeruaalem, when those things were
to happen. Then, not only were the
111lfferiugs of the Jews to begin, but
then also were their own sufi"eringa to
commence.
Thus, as upon the opening of the
fifth aea!, there were seen the souls of
the martyrs crying for the avenging,
and they were told to wait until their
brethren that abould be killed as they
were abould be ful.6lled : so here we
have that double killing foretold by
our Lord. " Then aball they deliTer
you up to be aftlicted, and aball kill
you; and ye aball be hated of all na-
tions for my name's sake." And then,
not only would the disciples be thus
killed by the heathen, but be also
persecuted by professing Christiane,
by the many who have been offended,
who have stumbled upon that stum-
bling stone: and who have betrayed
and hated the truefollowersofourLord:
and by false prophets, who would de-
ceive many, has the cause of Christ
been tried; and this trial we have suf-
ficiently seen and felt. " And because

iniquityshall abound, thelove ofmany
shall wax oold."
Then, sixthly, oorreepondent to the
deliverance of larael in the laat grand
lltruggle, when the mighty oppreseo1'11
of the earth shall be abaahed at the
return of Israel's King, it is here pre-
dieted, v. 13, " But he that shall en-
dure unto the end, the same shall be
laVed."
Throughout all this period of eor-
'row, the good news of the ooming
kingdom ofour blessed Lord has been,
in some measure, proolaimed ; but
again it ehall be preached in power as
in the apostolic age, and it shall be
distinctly the golp8l of the kingdom;
and it shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations.
Thet which began with the angel
ascending from the east, having the
seal of the living God, to seal the
144,000 of all the tribee of the chil-
dren of Israel, ehall progress unto the
deliverance of the fulness of the na-
tions, promised unto the fathers, and
described in Rev. ..U. " And then
shall the end oome," when there shall
be silence in heaven about the space
ofhalf an hour.
Then llhal1 be heard the Victor's praise,
In new triumphal 8011f!8 ;
· One gladsome alwut the earth llhal1 raise,
From all ita countless tbroll8L
And heaven llhal1 anawer to the earth,
The oainta in glory then
Shall sing their Sa'l'ioor'a mat.ehless worth,
And earth respond, " Amen."

~~~d~~d,asround,
Jer. xxx. 8-22, there Is, In Jer. xxx. '
23,24; xxxi.l-26,adescriptionofthe
circumstances inwhich the LostHonse
of Israel ahall be found, at the time
they enter into the consideration of
what their God hath said and done;
and when thus the words of the pro-
phets ahall be made known to them:
the exact fulfilment of which, in their
own case, ahall strike them with as-
tonishment ; and rean!t in loud ac-
claims to Him who hath dealt won-
dronsly with his people. There
ahall be shouts of wonder at the dis-
covery of his purposes, which were
of old, faithfulness and truth. Of
these thunders, that of the voice of
Judah's lion, at the going forth of the
white ho1'8e, in the apostolic preach-
ing ofthe gospel, was the precnrsor.-
The succeeding h01'8ell, which b&-
tokened jadgment, are not saidto have
theacoompaniment of a thunder: only
the first, which betokened mercy, had.
And this was the lion of Judah, the
only standard under which there was
at that time, the full preaching of the
gospel. The ox of Ephraim, the man
of Reuben, the eagle of Dan,-the
three living creatures connected with
the other standards of Israel, which
werefarther removedfrom the scene of
that preaching:-whose tribes had not
then the same opportunity of bearing
those glad tidings, are represented as
being alive rather to the judgments;
at the going forth of which in succes-
sion they simply said, " Come and
eee." They had not the loud and joy-
fnlacc!aim,representedbythethunder,
at the going f'otth or the white ho1'8e j
to the Rider upon which one <irown
was then given. The thunders ofthe
Living Creatures, which represent the
hosts of Israel, are particularly d&-
scribed, Ezek. ch. i. 24. It is the voice
oftheir wings; it is the glad going forth
with the publishing salvation ; and
great ehall be the e;ompany of them
that publish it, the Moat High himself
having given the word. And thus it
is Mid to be " like the noise of great
waters;"-but that is not enough:-it
is, " as the voice of the Almighty;"
and it is not only thus like thunder,
but clear " as the voice of speech."
The report ehall now be understood,
and whilst multitudinous, and power-
ful, and clear, it is an united and tri-
umphant shout, " as the noise of an
host," of the united hoet of Israel.
The thunders are, therefore, to be re-
garded as the voice of rejoicing and
triumph. It is larael's crowning of
Immanuel. " The Lord his God is
with him; and the shout of a King is
among them." It is the loud and
wondering exclamation, " What hath
Godwrought?" InRev. xiv.l-5,the
144,000 are represented M standing
with the Lamb on Mount Zion, when
it is said, " And I heard a voice from
heaven, as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of a fii"«U tlwntkr;
and I heard the voice ofharpers harp
ing with their harps." And again, in
ch. xiL 6, 7, the voice of thunder is
that of glorious triumph : " And I
heard, as it were, the voice of a great
multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the Yoice of mig!IIJ

The deaaription (Jer. :ux. 23, 24;
xxxi. 1-26) oonlliata of seven parti-
culars, 001Til8p0ndent, in subject and
order, with the seven eecuriliee pre-
ceding them. Thus,
.As the first 1100~ regarded the
CaWIB of Israel's ealvation, 110 here we
have the Time of Israel's salvation,
Jer. :ux. 23,24; xxxi. 1-6.
.As the IIBCODd security regarded
Israel's Return, 110 here we have inti-
mated the Place from which theRe-
turn shall be, Xxxi. 7-9.
.As the third security regarded the
Preservation of Israel, contrasting
their case, in thia respect, with that of
other nation& : 110 here we have their
Identity guaranteed, and abundant
Provision made for them by the Shep-
herd of Israel, xxxi. 10-14.
.As the fourth security regarded the
utterly Lost Condition ofIsrael, as re-
cognized by Him who hath promiaed
Co redeem: 110 here we have Rachel,
who W&8 bemoaning her children as
loet, oomforted with the &IIIUJ'8JlCe·of
their Redemption, xxxi. 15-17.
.As tile il.fth security ~ the
Healillg oflarul a&rcorrection, oon-
Uuting their 01118 with tllat of their
epoilerll : 110 here we have the Recog-
68
Dition of the lolt 11011, Ephraim, u
ClODICliona of haYing reoeived d.eeened
~; and, upon true repent-
ance, given the promiaed meroy,
xxxi. 18-20.
As the sixth eeourity reprded the
Return of Israel to perfect peace and
faln8118 of blaMing: 110 here we have
the bacbliding virgin of lB'88l in-
v.ited to that return, and &he appointed
place, her own eitiea, XDi. 21, 22.
And, fiDally, as the seventh eecarity
regarded the C.WIB of I.ael's aalft...
tion, Slid the RelteratioJI of their OOD-
stitutiOD u aforetime : 110 here we
have the peace and felicity of the
people, muler that OOD8iimtion, in the
Time appointed, 'xui. 28-J6. ·
This reoognit.ion of the !oat heire of
the promises ill, indeed, C8lt into U.
very same mould as that llllVBIIf'old
security for Israel'• future sad. eom-
plete 1'8ltoration s whieh restoration.
cannot be until thia recognition hu
taken place. Let us apin look, in
another point of view, at the euct
fitting of theee two seven& to each
other. Our God now ealla fot all
oouaideration in thestudyofhill word,
that 110 it may be ll8en in it& beauty,
and felt in ita power.
Attentively oouaidering them, we
shall find that, like aa the fourth, 1:he
middle of 1:he former seven, describes
Israel's utterly undone oondition in
herself, and without Christ, the mid-
dle or the present seven clearly ex-
presses Christ's onene88 with RaChel's
children: their sufferings a.re m-
Hia righteousnesa theirs- His work
ia made theirs; for ~ they are re-
warded.
.As in the sevenfold Security we&all'

ia the subject of the correspondent
members of the present seven.
And, finally, as Christ, our King
r.nd Governor, He, through whom the
iDheritr.nee ia obtained, ia the subject
of the beginning r.nd ending of the
former seven : eo lsrr.el r.nd Ju-
dah, the ()C)-heirs of the inheritr.nee,

of the first; r.nd lr.st of the seven npon
which we r.re now to enter.
Here He ia r.s the glory in the
midst of his people: whilst there He
ia r.s r. wr.ll of fire around them. Bnt,
with this agreement, there ia r. re-
JD&l'kable difference in the form of the
two sevene. They answer er.eh to
each. They seem intended to reflect
8IICh other, like Christ r.nd his Church.
And, indeed, ·it ia worthy of remark,
that whilst, in the former seven,lsrr.el
ia spokenofr.s r. mr.n, and theregovern-
ments and governors r.re the snbjeets
ofdiaeourse,herel!rr.elisohieflyspoken·

side this, those which r.re best &d&pted
to r.wr.k:en female sympr.thy; BDCh r.s
children,r.nd ample provision for their ·
oomfort r.nd ·hr.ppineas. There is,
throughout the whole of this second
seven,thatbre&thingofpr.rentr.ltender-
neBB, which ia eo congenial to the fe-
mr.le breut. With this distinction of
these two sevens, there ia yet r. blend-
ing of the one into the other, espeeir.lly
u to their centres. Each seven seems
to hr.ve the other in its her.rt: even
u Christ h&B his people, r.nd r.s his
people should hr.ve Him. God ia
wonderful ·in counsel, and exeellen~
in working.
The lirllt, Jer. xu. 28, !U; x:ai, 1-6, re1r.tee to the T!KB of Ill'llel's delivm~~~ee. It
deacn'bes their put dispenion, present recognition, and future restoration. The liJ'OPheey
of Isaiah, whoee name mer.ns Solvatioll of tlw Lord, most l'lllly eeta bel'ore oa tlie Lord'a
great salvr.tion of larr.el, and particularly points out the timea and -.ons relaliDg
tbere!o.
The seoond, v. 7-9, telates to the PucB out of which Ill'llel waa to be raised up, and
given the great restoration. Jeremiah, whoee name mea:oa tlw Lord 1hall raiu up, or
exalt, :points out most distinctly the quarter in which ontc&st Israel would be 1iAed up,
through the power of her King, who baa been raised up unto her.
The third, v. 10-U, relates to the Identity of larr.el, aa being p~ed throughout all
their cha.nges. Ezekiel, whose name mer.ns God umr Strength, points to the source of
Israel's sustenance, assures of their preservation, and describes theu recovery when they
ahall take God alone aa their help.
The fourth, v. 111-17, intimaks the Oneness of Christ with his people. Their suffer-
ings hr.ve by him been borne, and for his work they are rewarded. .The Psalms ofDavid,
whose name means Belwtd, more particularly illustrates this unity of the Bridegroom with
the Bride, of the lion of the tribe of Judah with the children of Rachel.
The ftfth, v. 18-20, describes the Recognition of the lost son, Ephraim, to be m&de
Erepentanee, and after much preparative training among the Gentiles. The pro.
of Hosea, whoee name mer.ns Salt1aliMt, more particulr.rly illustrates the cr.se of
phraim, and most clearly predicts his salvation.
The sixth, v. 21, 22, points to the Place to which Israel shall return upon the grer.t
restoration : when shall be enjoyed the fulness of the blessings promised unto the fathers.
Zechariah, whose ume meana MtfiiOrial oltlw Lord, pr.rlicnlally dwells upon this future
reetoratioo, and die place otits COIIIJIIIIIIIIalion.
The seventh, v. 28-26, relates to the Time of I81'8el's salvation, and Ia illustrated ftom
the propheey ofMicah. It is when llraelllld Judah are both truly 1aumbltd au lwouglat

INTRODUCTION TO TRE SEVEN THUNDERS. 65
,JUDGMENT AND MERCY.
JEB. xxx. 23, 24; xxxi. 1.
"Behold, the whirlwind of the r..;rd goeth forth with fury,
A continuing (or cutting) whirlwind: '
It shall fall with pain upon the head of the \\icked;
The fierce anger of the Lord sllall not n:tnrn, until he have done,
And until he have performed the intents ofhis heart :
In the Iauer days ye shall consider it. -
At the same time, aaith the Lord,
Will I be the God of all the families of Israel,
And they shall be my people!"
J ERE)[IAHWas,ch.XXV.,bid to take the
wine-cup of fury, and go forth with it
unto the nations, beginning at Jeru-
salem,around which the whirlwind was
sent, apparently enlarging its circle as
it proceeded. It took in Pharaoh, king
of Egypt, and all the mingled people,
and all the kings of the land of Uz;
and oll the kings of the Philistines,
and Ashkelon, nnd Azzah, nnd Ekron,
and the remnant of Ashdod ; and,
turning round to the south-east, it
toOk in Edom, and Moab, and the -
children of Ammon ; and, coming
ronnd again to the west, it took in
" all the kings of Tyre, and oll the
kings of Zidon, and the kings of the ·
isles that are beyondthe sea," stretch-
ingout thus to the farthest west. And
then, going round again to the south-
east, ond thence northward, "to all
the kings of the Medes,n it was
said, " And all the kings of the north,
far and near, one with another; and all
the kingdoms of the world which are
upon the face of the earth ; and the
king of Sheshach shall drink after
them." And this was the command,
" Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue,
and foll, and rise no more, because of
the sword which I will send among
you."-" Thus saith the Lord, Behold,
evil shoJI go forth from nation to na-
tion, and a great whirlwind shoJI be
raised up from the coasts of the earth."
Much of this we know to have taken
place. Much of it happened in the
open view of the world; and much of
it is told merely by its effects; and
e .
this espcciolly with regard to the
kings of the north. Israel, or the
remnant of the ten tribes, carried cap-
tive beyond Assyria, appear to have
speedily freed themselves from the As-
syrian yoke, and to havebecomepeace-
ablylocatedolongthe backofthe Black
Sea, and the b:lllks of the Danube.
Here, however, they were not ollowed
to remain. In the second century of
the Christian era, the whirlwind above
described, having reached the kings of
the north far and near, a vast multi-
tude of nations were set in motion.
The movement seems principally to
have occurred in the far east, and
thence to have proceeded north-west-
ward, which is the very order of the
whirlwind beginning at Jernsale!p.
One nation was precipitated upon ano-
ther: the Huns, for example, upon the
Ostrogoths; the Ostrogoths upon the
Yisigoths; and the Yisigoths upon the
Roman empire : upon which, indeed,
au immense number of other natio~s
were at the same time thrown. The
Yandols having passed over into
Africa, and ransacked the Roman pro-
vinces there, whirled ronnd therefrom,
under Genseric, upon Rome itself, and
stripped the very capitol for the sake
of its covering. Even thus early this
whirlwind fell with pain npon the
head of " the wicked."
A respite seemed to be given when
the Gothic nations, who also had
severely deolt with Rome and its
provinces, became spiritually sub-
ject to Rome; when many of them

became thechiefpropsofPapalascend-·
ency. But bas the anger of the
Lord ceased? No: "The fierce an-
ger of the Lord shall not return until
he have done:" an e'xpreseion repeat-
edly referred to, both in the Old Tes-
tament prophecies and in Revelation ;
and referring to the accomplisb-
plent of judgment preparatory to the
millennia! reign, the ·clearing his
heritage ofall intruders: Ezek. xxxix.
8; Rev. xvi. 17; xxi. 6. It is ·
here added, " And until be have
performed the intents of his heart."
These are his purposes of good to-
wards his chosen people. It is here
intimated that these words would long
remain comparativelyhidden ; without
being weighed and considered, as their
importiUlce deiDIUlds : but it is pro-
mised that at length, " In the latter
days, ye shall consider it." We are
now in the latter days. The time
for consideration is our own time.
Soon may the migbtythunderings of
Israel, as praising the Lord for his
goodness, and for his wonderful works
unto the children of men, awaken to
earnest consideration the long-slum-
bering Jew.- Yea, may both soon
unite in awaking the world with the
thrilling acclaim, "Alleluia! the Lord
God omnipotent reigneth." And when
thepeopleaddressedhave been brought
to consider, for what the curse hath
devoured the land, and themselves
have been scattered, a hissing and a
by-word among nl1 people, they will
be able to read their sin in their
· punishment: when they see that land
which, since their rejection of Christ
as King; hath only been to them a
place of destruction ;-when they see
that land made beautiful, and abund-
ant in blessing, for a people claiming
it in the name of Jesus, and desiring
it simply that they may therein glo-
rify Him whom the fathers ofthe Jews
there put to shame,-then will not
they loathe themselves for those ini-
1 quities, on account ofwhich they have
been len out of the blessing, and the
land has been so long kept in dcgra.
dation, defilement, and desolation?-
Will they not then seck blessing in
Him in whom alone it can be found?
and in whom it will have been actu-
ally found by their brethren of the
bouse of Israel, even when east out 1
among the Gentiles, undistingnished
as to origin, and their destiny tm-
known. . ·And now also blessing will
have accompanied these into the land.
They are now brought nigh, as having
the loving-kindness of the Lord ex-
tended unto them. And the desira-
bleneaa of this loving-kindness, Judah,
who bas so long rejected it, will at
length see. When brought to C<!n-
sider the blessing and the curse, in
the case of All the families of Israel,
and in their own case, both mit of the
land and in it; and the relation which
the blessing evidently has to the re-
ceiving of the truth as it is in Jesus,
then J uda.h is not far from the rea1i-
zation of the promise along with ¥mel,
" And ye .shall be my people, and I,
will be your God." Thus intimately
connected is the salvation of Judah,
with the manifestation of the lost
children ofJoseph,as sons of the living
God. To this recognition of the lost
children of Rachel do we now more
particularly direct our attention.-
Therewith comes the grand develop-
ment of the divine purposes, both as
to the fut-qre and the past.
The words, " Ye shall consider it;'
may more particularly refer to the
Jews, a people present with, or near
to, the prophet; whereas the other
house, " All the families of Israel,"
were then a people far off, and lll'C
spoken of in the third person thus,-
" At the sa.me time, saith the Lord, will
I be the God ofnl1 thefamiliesofIsrael,
and they shallbe my people,"-Ammi.
Thehouse oflsrael isthatwhich ishere
spoken of. It does not necessarily in-
clude that of Judah ; but the expres-
sion clearly indicates that the different
families of Israel, whether of tbe
escaped, or of those that were led
captive, have, generally at least, come
within the hearing of the Gospel ; and
put on the profession of being the
Lord's people: which cannot, in the
latter days, be done, but as embracing
Christianity.

Yea, I have loved thee with an e•·erlnsting love :

.t\N.A.LOGOUS to the case of ancient
Isra.el was that of the western na-
tions of Europe: It is remn.rkable,
that after their embracing Christianity
as it then existed, tho .first thing,
and inP,eed the only thing in which
they ever · all united all their
hearts and arms, was the combining
in fierce and persevering efforts to
obtain the land of Israel, the land of
their fathers, although, as such, they
seem not to have known it. Their
object was the recovery of the Holy
Sepulchre out of the hancls of the
infidels. There, however, is not
merely the plu.cc where the Lord lay,
but where, in glory, he sl1all sit upon
the tlu:one of his father David. They
went up wilfully to take possession of
the land by the power of the sword,
e'2
and ~o erect a kingdom there, like the
kingdoms of the world. .A11d, like
Israel in their waywarclness, when
passing up&om the wilderness, Numb.
xiv. 40-45, they attacked their ene-
mies, although the time had not come
when the Lord would give them the
possession, Ol' when they were pre-
pared to receive it: They in conse-
. quence were allowed to fall before
their enemies. They wore turned
buck into the wilderness to be better
taught of the'Lord. Thus it was
with ancient Israel, in their coming up
out of the ,southern wilclemess from
Egypt-and thus it was with these
nations, that have sprung of Jacob, as
emerging from the nortluirn wilder-
ness, after having escaped from the
AssJliari yoke. The analogy i!_ sug-

ges~ in the text: " Thus s:lith the
Lord, The people left of the sword
touu<l grace in thu wilderness, even
Isrncl, when I went to cause him to
rest:'' so was it with these nations
tLftcr the crusades. True, they were-
driill!n back from possessingthe land :
but, in other re~pccts, the Lord's
favour for them Wl\8 rellliLl'knble.
Their civil governments were better
settled. Their religions views became
brightened, until, in mn.ny of' these
nations, thm·e was ru1 entire bursting
from under the thmldom of the man
of Rome ; ll.Dd the light of revelation
bccmne free as the light of the nntuml
sun. In the meantime they were in a
continual state of impmvement, with
regard to science and art, and litern-
ture of almost every description. The
globe was grndun.lly compassed by
them; and the riches of nature, 110d
the treasures of iUitiquity ltud open to
their .vic"'· Thus true wn.s it, in
modern as in 110cicnt times, that " Tho
people that were left of the sword,
found grace in the wilderness."
When the attention ofmodem Israel
is thus directed hack to the Lord's
dealings with our fiLthers in the times
of old; and when we nre directed to
trace 1r .likeness of our own ease to
theirs, it might be expected that we
should begin to see more of simi-
larity than cnn be accounted for,
e~cept upon the supposition of our
being the very people to whom the
Lord gnve tlmt training, IUid those in-
stitutions, which have·so greatly con-
duced toelevate theseournations abo,·e
• every other people. Ours is that
continual increase promised in theYcry
name of Joseph; llllLY ours be that
fruitfulness of which the name of his
ron Ephmim speaks; ofwhich younger
son was to come the fulness ofnations.
Ours is the constitutional and repre-
sentative government, under a limited
monarchy, "·hich had been given to
Israel. Ours was the division of the
people into tens, and hundreds, and
lru-ger sections, nccordb1g ns Moses
divided the children of Israel. Ours
were laws bearing the stamp of the
Mosa.ic laws; andchronicles,analogous
to tho chronicles of the kings of Isrncl.
Ours were usages, both in peace IUid
in wnr, which attest .tho srune origin;
110d the same is witnessed to by even
our ancient religious belief, and places
of worship, IUld priesthood; nnd times,
and ceremonies, ru1d llllLllncr of wor-
ship, which, although, as was pre-
dicted, greatly corrupted, still bear
unequh·ocal evidence of onr having
been at one tinle brought Yery near to
the God of Isrnel.
Witl1 such abundant datn from
which to draw the inference, it might
be expected that the people, who were
made Lo-runmi, but who h:l\'e so sig-
1
nally been dealt with as tl1e Lord·s
people, would at length cxcluim, "The
Lord hath appeared of old unto me."
But the marginn.l reading appears to
be the more correct one, " The Lorcl
hath appeared from afar unto me;"
which words Israel, who were cru;t far
off, may be supposed to utter whibt
still ignorant of Onr Ismelitish Ori-
gin. She may thus speak as gratefnl
tor the grace brought unto her in the
preaching of the gospel, which, from
Jerullnlem, was sent afar ofl' unto the
Gentiles. The Lord appears to have
removed the ark of his covcnn.nt from
the east to the west-to have with-
drawn from the Jews, who were near;
nnd to have revealed himself unto us
Gentiles who were afar off. It wns in
this direction more especially that the
feet of his messengers were sent. To
persons or places along this great line,

Gentiles: He would shew them his
word, and tell them of how it is that
He bath dealt with them as he hath
not dealt with any other nation. Ho
would open up unto them tho mystery
of revelation, of providence, yea., also
of creation. He would convince them
that they are not a mere substitute
for Israel, bnt tho very people unto
whom the promises were made,-that
they arc the very people with regard
to whom his counsels were of old; and
which l1e now desires should be fully
proved to be " filithfulness and truth;"
and thus his reply is, " Yen, I ha\·e
loved thee with an everlasting," that
is, with an unceasing " love: there-
fore with loving-kindness lliiVO I
drawn thoo," or," therefore hnvo I ex-
tended loving kindness towards thee."
From this it would appear, that
· Israel will h:t\'e been drnwn to tho
Lord by lovin&k-indness ; that is,
by his gospel, before she perceives
that th:s same to \vhom she is now
wedded, as her Ishi, or companion
husband, Hoseaii. 14-li, she of old
knew as her husband, according to
·the law. It would also seem that
the Lord would e\·cr manifest a pecu-
liar favour for Israel, such as he l1as
done lor these nations. And, pointing
to the blessing with which he l1ath
fiLVourcd us, t.he God of Israel may
well say, " Yea, I have loved thee with
an everlastin~ love:" a )ove wl1ich
was eternal, which no backsliding of
theirs hath been able to remove:
" therefore \\;th lo\ing-kindness l1ave
I dmwn thee." The position thus of
Israel, at the time of their discovery, ,
is ours. It is that of lmving been
sutTounded with the e\idences of
Jehovah's peculiar fiwour--of having
had extended to us the Lor!l's loving
kin<lness.
·We have now our attention carried
onward to tho coming ll'rn.e: when
Israel, hitherto dispersed, or broken
up into a multitude of nfllions, will be
built together into one, in holiness to
the Lord: when the Lord will no
more, as in the former case, drive
them bnck from the land: but h:wing
prepared them for it, he will build
them np tl1ereon. Then will Israel
be arrayed in beauty, and in glory,
and she ~hall be joyful-" going forth
in the dances of them that make
merry." Then shall she have posses-
sion of the \' CI'Y land of Israel : plant-
ing vines upon the mountains of Sa-
maria. Tho planters shall plant
them, but not to make gain of
t.hem; " the planters shall pl:mt, and
make them coDllllon." Thus will
there be abundance; nnd plentiful
lihcrality; they shall be len common.
This plenty will be through Israel's
ncknowlcclgill~lu~ir King. At' She-
chem All Ismcl departed from Judnh,
and rcfuS"Cd to go any more up uuto
Zion ns aeknowlcd~ng the descend-
ant of David as King; but now ou
Mount Ephraim will there be a cnll to
go up unto tho place where the Sou
of David is to reign, and which now
will be called t!1o throne of the J.ord.
So is it said, " For there shall he 11
day that tho watchmen upon Mount
Ephraimshnllsay, "Ari~oyc,nnd Ictus
go up to Zion, unto tho Lord our God."
The words of this first thunder
uatnrally ai\;de thcm,eh·es into three
portion;., describing time past, prcs<'nt.,
and to oomc. Time past, is the time
of the sword, and also of llnding
gmcc in the \\·ilderness, xxxi. 2.
Time prcl'ent, is tho time of Israel's
being called •to know what the Lord
hnt.h dono for them, as 'being his
chosen}Jcople, 3. And the time yet
future, is the time of their being built
up in their own l1\nd ; and not, ns
heretofore. separated from Jerusalem,
but worshipping at Zion the Lord
their God, v. 4-6:
In the book of fsainh there is much
the same general division of subject.
Thus, from cb. i.-xxxix., the pro-
phecy is, almost entirely,occupied with
tho going forth of judgment, now
j,'I'Catly fulfilled; interspersed witl1 an-
ticipations of what will be tl1e voice of
Israel and Judah, wheu they shall in
truth consider the prophetic worJ, and

there, as was predicted by Hosea; and
when they are called upon to know
themaelvea the very people unto whom
the promises were made, and in whom
they have been wondronaly fulfilled,
although they knew it not. _
From ch. li..:._Ixn., we ha>e the
Lord pointing almost entirely to the
future.
In l8aiah li. 1-8, three calla are
given to-Israel to "hearken" to the
prophetic word. They_are, first, as
individual Christians, called to ex-
emplify the faith of their father Abra--
ham, in proceeding to the. land no'v
desolate, but in which He will bless
them, v. 1-3. ' Secondly, ·as become
again His nation, and as waiting the
commission with which they are to go
forth to allnntions, v. 4-6. Thirdly,
as being sent forth, in the preach-
ing of the eYerlasting gospel, and wit.!J.
the warning of coming judgment,
amid the scom of oo unbelieving
world, v. 7, 8.
Then thrice is there a double call to
"aWilke,"ch. li. 9-23; Iii. 1-,-6. Firs:,
aa to the " arm of the Lord ;" the
instntmentality through which He
wrought in ancient times, is recog-
nised u that through which He will
put forth power still, li. 9-16. Se-
condly, Jcruaalemiscalledto"awake,"
her present pi'OI!trate condition being
fully recognised, v. 17-23. Thirdly,
Zion is called to " awake," and put
on strength : the power of the name
of the Lord is to be known. Ti1e
name of the anointed King of Zion
will there and thence be declared,
1ii. 1-6.
'Then there nrc three prophetic
visions declared by the prophet. Is.
Iii., 7- 15 Iii. First, of Israel's
gathering to the lnnd, in acknow-
ledgment of their King, and for tho
declaring of His pmis3 therefrom to
all the ends of the earth, Iii. 7-12.
The Father then points to Him
unto whom the g:lthering is to be,
v. 13-15. Secondly, the prophet
contemplates the first coming, and re-
jection then of Him, upon the ground
of whose atonement there is now re-
conciliation for the people, liii. I~.,
The Father again speaks ;,r Him
1!'hose patience in witnessing to the
truth, His people are to follow, v.
7-9. TbiFdly, the ~bet looks
forward to the reward, m the raising
up of the promised seed, v. 10; and
the Father replies u to the same,
v.ll-13.
In ch. liv., thia numerous -t
is recognised aa being more of outcas~
Israel, who seemed to be put away,
than of Judah, retained under tho
maJTiage covenant of the law,. v.
1-6. The pennanency of the new
coYenant, according to which outcast
Israel is married to the Lord, ia re-
cognised, v. 7-10. And the glory,
peace, protection, and blessing of her
future building up, are dwelt upon,
v. ll-17.
The instrumentalitv "·berebv Israel
are to be raised up, ihe word"as dili-
gently listened to, and regarded aa
indeed the word of God ; and tho
certainty of its resulting in the re-
storation of the people, are declared
in elL lv.
In lvi. 1 - 8, it is pointed out
that when the Lord manifests His
truth, in causing His blessing to fall
so especially upon the bead of Jo-
seph, then neither those spoken of aa
eunuche, nor the mere Gentiles or
strangers, me to think themselves ex-
cluded from the ble~ing. It is upon
the same terms, equally free to the
Jew,v. 4, 5, and the Gentile, v. 6-8.
The people unto whom the land is
appointed are recognised, lTii. 13-21.
The preparntion of this believing
people for restoration to the land, as
doing works meet for repentance, ia
set forth in ch. lviii.
·In ch. lx. the glorious restoration
of Israel is described, Zion is calIt'd to
arise in light, n.nd see her children
gathering to her an every side, and
especially by swift-sailingvesseia from
the west. " Surely the isles shall
wait for me; IUld the ships ofTarshish
first, to bring thy sons from far, their
sih·e.r and their gold with them, unto
the name of the Lord thy God, and
to the Holy One of lsrfe1, because he
hath glorified thee."

country ? " Behold, I will bring
them from the north country." The
very call, " Behold," intimates that
something is to be looked for of
a very surprising nature-something
that had not previously been attended
to as it ought: and such certainly hRS
been the case with regard to the pro-
mise~, in this very prophet, made to
the house of Ismel or Ephmim, RS
having been taken into the north coun-
try, and as having the word of the
Lord sent afte, them to that quarter,
so as to be made tho Lord'g people,
according to the tenns of the New
Testament dispensation, when out of
the laud. But not only were the great
body oftho people taken into the north
country, where, bein,j given the gates
of their enemies, they have gone out
and encompassed the carth.-There
were also those that escaped in dif-
ferent directions, and especially west-
ward by the shipping of Tyre; and
these the Lord promises to bring into
unity with those that were led away
captive into the north country. He
" will gather them from the coasts of
tlteearth: " Those let\ from Egyptand
Pathros towards the south; from Cush
and Elam towards the east; from Shi-
nar and Hamath towards the north ;
and from the islands ofthe sea towards
the west, Ho will again set his hand
to recover. When He shall set up an
ensign to the nations, and &Ssemble
tho outcasts of Ismel. He will also
gather the dispersed of Judah from the
four corners of the earth. And his
extreme carefulness with regard to
Israel, his peculiar ~ure, is still
farther expressedbyits being said, that
he will bring " with them the blind
and the lame; the woman with chil4,
and her that trnvaileth with child
together."
These words, beside their more
literal import, may, ,perhap~, refer
to Mich. iv. 6 -13; v. 1 ....._ 3,
where the promise is given respect-
ing the restoration of the lame, or
her that haltcth, -.which, as distin-
guished from her that wns driven out,
Recms to refer to J ndah, which '~as to
be made,n remnant, just 118 she that
was driven out was to become a strong
nation. The 'voman that travaileth is
there shown to be Judah; and she that
was yet to bring forth, after the re-
storation of the Jews from Babylon,
it is as clearly intimated was the other
house of Israel, the desolate wom:~n
that was driven out, .but who wa.~ to
have many more children than Judah:
until which bringing forth of the mul-
titude promised to Ephraim, the Jews,
ns having rejected their King when
He came to them, were to be given
up, and at length these, the remnnnt
of his brethren according to the flesh,
will return unto the children of
Ismel, who ha,·e previously acknow-
ledged their King the .Judge of
Israel, born ns the Son of David in
Bethlehem, but " whose goings forth
have been from of old, from everlast-
ing." His eternal counsel shall stand,
so that thus, not only a remnant shall
return, but a great company shall
retnrn thither. See Mich. v. 1-3.
The mnnner of their return is like
that of the prodigal son, or as Eph-
raim is afterwards described; they
shall como with weeping, acknow-
ledging their iniquity, their mnny nnd
grievous backsliding&, their inability
tosavethemselves,andascastingthem-
selves simply and entire~y upon tho
free mercy of God in Christ, both for
pardon, and for power to do the will
of their Father. And their Father
meets them, as, indeed, he is ready to
meet us, with all compa.,sion and 'vil-
lingness to bless-with supplications,
rather with: fnvonrs, ' will he lead
them.' And cert:Unly all this docs
not remain to be accomplished, for
already has ho multiplied his kind-
nesses to~ards us in all respects, as
was promised unto Joseph our father.
And snith the Lord, " I will cause
them to walk," not in a drv and stony
desert, as c<;>ming up out ofEgypt, but

and the lame may travel without in-
ci>nvenience : but all this appears to
bebutas the signofstillgreater favours
ofa spiritual nature,which He is ready
to bestow, if the bouse of l81'&el do
but, as invited, ask them oftheir abun-
dant Provider. Then will He cause
to flow out, even of themselves, rivers
of living water. Then will He lead
them in a plain patb,,and a way full
of glorio.us light, notwithstanding all
the dark devices of the enemy.
It is to be considered that Ephraim
is especially concerned in the restora-
tion of Israel. As beipg constituted
the first-born, it is both liis duty and
his privilege to act for the welfare of
" all the families of Israel; to take
possession, for them, of the land of
their fathers, and in which more espe-
cially their Heavenly Father would
bless them; to clear obstructions out
of the way, and cast up highways,
whereby they may return in the cir-
cumstances described: as being found
in the position of the first-born, with
wondrous instrumer.tality for accom-
plishing the work appointed, not only
right but responsibility is concerned
in the case. As God would prove a
Father to Israel, let Ephraim exercise
himself in the duties belonging to the
birthright. Let him feel and ·act as
the first-born.
Jeremiah more particularly points
out the place in which Israel was to
be found, and whence they are to re-
turn to the land of their fathers :
Thus (ch. iii. 11, 12), when the word
of reconcilia.tion is sent afi:er back-
sliding Israel, as contrasted with
treacherous J udab, it is directed to-
wards the north country: in which
direction the word of the Lord, in the
prea.ching of the gospel, bath subse-
quently, for the most part, been sent.
A.nd here, in the north country, the
' principle of representation is most
fully recognised: according to which
principle, Israel shall present them-
selves at Jerusalem, when the king-
dom shall be the Lord's. Seev.14-16.
A.nd here also, in the notth country,
is the better portion of Judah, who are
to walk with Is.rael out of the land of
the north into the laild given unto
their fathers.
.Again, in chap. xvi. 14, 15, where
the promised restoration is spoken of
aseclipsingthedeliverancefromEgypt,
it. is said to be particularly from the
land of the north. A.nd hither, into
the north country, where were the
outcasts of Isrnel, have alsa been
drawn the Jews by the Greek and
Roman fishermen ; and hither, also,
have they been bunted by the Saracen
and Turkish horsemen-v. 16.
Also, in chap. x:xiii. 8, the north
·country is especially noticed as that
out of which the seed of the bouse of
· Israel shall ~ led. " Therefore, be-
. hold, the days come, saith the Lord,
that they shall no more say, the Lord
liveth, which brought up:the children
ofIsrael out of the land of Egypt; but
the Lord liveth, which brought up and
which led the seed of the bouse of
Israel out of the north country, and
from all countries whither I bad
driven them; and they shall dwell in
their own land."
In ch. xx:xili. HI, 16, it is again
promised, " In those days, and at that
time, will I cause the Branchof Righ-
teousnesstogrow up untoDavid." "In
those days shall Judah be saved, and
Jerulllkm shall dwell safely." Before,
in ch. xxiii., it was said, "I~rael shall
dwell safely." But Israel shall have
now been broughthome, and beknown
by the name Jernsalem; and ~~
hath now the name of her husband
put upon her, the marriage of the
Lamb having come. A.nd so it is here
said, " And this is her name where-
with she shall be called, the 4n"d
our Righteousness." The people
to be more especially found in Christ,
are the people of the promise.
A.nd we have seen that the Scripture
most distinctly recognises their dwel-
ling as being jn our own part of the
world, previous to their discovery; and
as trnly will Jerusalem become their
capital, when their faces are turned to-
wards Zion, when the eyes of all the
tribes of Israel. shall be towards the
Lord.

THE God of Israel bas indeed seen it
meet to chastise his children, but it
was for correction, and in order to
receive them again 88 sons of the liv-
i.Qg God. That He may miUiifest
HimsGlf unto them, and mo.ke Eph-

that he hn.s been so higbly fuvoured

before. And that .th~y may sec
therein the tn1th and f.'\ithfulncss of
God, let the word of promise be now
fairly IUld fully rend; and, being un-
derstood, let it be boldly and gcnQ-
rally declared: that so God may be
known in this identification of his
people. Let the first-born now nt
last and in very deed, set to his sc{ll
that God is true. Unbelief v:hispers,
Surely these c:mnot be the litcrai de-
scendants of tho people who ha,·e been
lost ~ince the Assyrian capth·ity, lost
more thnn 2500 years ago~ &> many
revolutions of empires and migrations
of tribes, unci scattering of nations,
and mixing up of races have occurred
since that time, that, even snppo~in.~
them to exist, it would indcod be diffi-
cult to identify them, and particulru·ly
so in Europe. It cannot be,-some
other meaning must be put upon the
words. Ephraim crumot mean Eph-
raim; norcnn Israel mean Isrnel. But
what sn.ith the Lord to all this? Even
this, " Hear the wo\'(1 of the Lord, 0
ye nations! and declare it in the i•lcs
afar oft':" that is, let .it be published
loudly and plainly among these the
nations, thnt were to come of Jncob,
the multitude of which was espccinlly
promisor! to Ephraim, and who were
to renew their strength in the islands.
To the people whom it concerns, nnd
' who have been so slow to acknow-
ledge their Owner, let it be declared,
in answer to all such presumptuous
1·easonings against tho possibility of
God's fulfilling his prophetic word:
" He that scattered Ismel will gnther
him, and keep him as a shepherd
doth his flock." Israel, or the king-
dom of tho ten tribes, was scattered at
the time of tho Assyrian captivity nl-
ready referred to : then tho maJn
body of tho nation was Jed away
north-cn.st, to the borders of the Cas-
._ pian and Euxine Sea.~; whilst others
1- fled south, and west: some to Egypt,
where however it does not Rllpeur
they long remn.ined; others, by tho
ships of Tyrc, or other conveyance,
passed fartllCr down the Mediterra-
nean, to Italy and Spain; and a few
seem even at that early period to have
j!'One beyond, and to ha,·e reached
the~ isles afar off.
Thus was the Lord ~tationing the
escaped of Israel, ulong the coasts of
the very country, into which the mn.in
body ot' the nation, that hnd been led
captive, was about to come. This
was done when tho nations now'in
tho north-\\·est of.Europe, or in places
colonized from thence, were driven
forward li-01n the south-east to occupy
their present important position. Thus
already hath God RO far a.ccompliohcd
his wod, in gathering Israel into one
place; whore He l1ath indeed wonder-
fully prc!'Crved them and provided tor
them. TIIC Lord hath been. ns (Ezek.
xi. 16.)lle said He would be, a Little
Sanctuary, to the Outeast house of
Israel, in tho countries into wl1ich they
ha\'e come. With them the blessing
rem!lins, and with them it spreads out
unto all the ends of the earth.
There is nlso to be a gathering to-
gether of the outcast Isrnel after they
have increased as the sand of tho
sea ; anrl, in the place where they
were not recognised as the Lord's
peculinr people, are they to be called
tl10 sons of the living God-Jm,·ing
been made possesi!Ors of the privileges
believers of the gospel enjoy in Christ.
Then it is that the children of Ju-
dah and the children oflsrael shall be
gathered together, nnd appoint them-
selves one head, and come up out of
the land, for great shall be the day of
Jezreel. See Hos. i. 10, 11.
The gathering together is progres-
sive ; first locally, of Israel in tl1e
north country, where also the de-
scendants of the Ch1istian Jews of the
primitive church have commingled
with their Christianized bretlu;en of
tho house of Joseph. Here locally
also hnve the unbelieving Jews been·
gathered together with their brethren,
and n spiritual union may be expoctcd
to take place as to many of them. In
the land of their fathers there is also
to be looked for a still farther
gathering together, both local nud
spiritual. When the J.ord, Yery

ly nfter, will gnthcr together the

bring this earth into visible unity with
higher modes of spiritual existence-
when He will gather together all
t!Jings' in Himself, both the things
which are in benven, and which nro
on earth, then shall there be a glo-
rious consummation of this Increnso
of God.
God bns tPns, Jer. xxxi. 10, pre-
sented himself ns nn instructing father
to l~11el and specinlly to Ephraim.
He is also there presented ns the
Shepherd King, who will gather nnd
lf.cep; and nil this be doth ns the Re-
deemer. Of the Lord is the redemp-
tion of his people. Christ is the Re-
deemer specin.lly of Israel; not to the
exclusion of others, who m~y be
joined to them; and with them pnr-
t.'\ke of the root nnd fatness of tl1e
olive tree; but tl)ey aro the nntnrnl
branches. The Redeemer is empha-
tically the God of Israel. For them
·did the Lord of glory not only con-
descend to come down into our na-
ture, nnd pay the redemption price,
but He is even exalted for the special
purpose of giving repentance to Isrnel
nnd remission of sins. lt is not tJ:ue,
that He who remembere~h his cove-
Dllllt for ever, hntb forgotten what He
came to do, and whnt He hntb gone
to accomplish. He hnth been hasten-
ing to perform his word. Soon may
Israel accept of the punishment of his
iniquity, and be made willing to go
free; so sbnll his bonds be broken.
" Therefore they shall come and sing
in tho height of Zion; and shall flow
together, to the goodness of the LOrd."
The reconciling power of the priest-
hood of Christ, shall thus be made
manifest in bringing them into closer
union with each other in the Lord,
even upon his holy mountain : where
his table sbn.ll be sp1·ead lor all peo-
ple:-a.q for wheat, and for wine, and
lor oil, and the young of the flock and
of tho herd, tMre shall be thenceforth
no lnck. Their soul shall be ns n
watered garden, which is carefully
and abundantly, and continually re-
freshed. As to these things they shall
not sorrow any more at all ; there
shnll be no farther po.inful experience
i
n thnt respect. They shall have
obeyed tho commnncl; aud hnve found
the promi~e true, " Seek ye first the
kingdom ofGod,and his righteousness;
and all these things shnll be added
unto you.., There is here an identi-
.ficntion of human nature, ns presently
constituted. Tho virgin, the young
men, nod the old together, are recog-
nized; and ns well the priests and the .
people:-so that it is not the heavenly
Inheritance nor the glorified saints
that are here spoken ot: The people
here described are Israel nftcr the flesh,
made in truth the people of God; ns
hnving their mourning turned ·into
joy; ns comforted, nod IDI\de to re-
joice from their son-ow. It is true
1tbnt they hnve now a sufficiency of
tempornl blessing. - Tho vegetable
productions of the earth, wheat, and
wine, and oil, nrc mentioned, as also
the most delicate ruul nutritious of
animal foods.-Notwithstanding the
immense flowing together into one
place, tho supply shn.ll fully answer
the demand, ns to n.ll thnt belongs to
the body.-And all shall be partaken
of with gladness and gratitude: but it
is spiritual blessing with which the
whole is crowned, and which shall
611Jlctify nil other blessing. And thus
it is said, " And I will satiate the soul
of the p1iests with fatness, and my
people shall be satisfied witl1 my
goodness, saith the Lord." What a
1ich unfolding of the word will there
be, when the priests shall no longer
be lean ns before, nod when the peo-
ple shall not have the snmo cold
morsel served up to them a,<>'Rin, nnd
ngnin,,nnd nguin: but when the meek
shall increase their joy in the Lord,
nnd the poor among men shall rejoice,
as described, in the Holy One of Is-
rael!
The question naturally arises ns to
the constitution of things under which
this abundance of blessing temporal
and spiritunl is to be enjoyed. Is it
to be before, or after the Lord's second
coming? There pan be no doubt but
that the happiness to be enjoyed un-
der the dominion of the glorified saints
will be equal to this; but it would

will be a restoration of Israel to
the land-even of outcast Israel.
They return to the land in expecta-
tion of the Lord's speedy appean11g in

thereof that the great reJoicing Is; as
well as because of the wonders He

For thy work ohall be rewarded, aaith the Lord ;
And they shall come again from the lnnd of the enemy.
And there is hope in thine end, oaith the Lord,
Thnt thy children 8hnll come again to their own bolder."
THE weeping here referred to, is in
Matt. ch. ii. v. 18, applied to the case
of the slaughter of the infants by
Herod, when he aimed at the destruo-
tion of the child Jesus, who had been
born king of the Jews. Jesus, how-
ever, was safely conducted to Egypt,
and there preserved,until he was taken
to Galilee, the north of the land of
Israel; and there he was brought up.
These things, with many others, ap-
pear to have happened to Christ as
the representative ofhispeople: Israel,
after having been called out of Egypt,
have turned II.Side unto the north
country, and there they have been
brought up. Christ was a minister of
the circumcision, to confirm the pro-
mises made unto .the fathers. " He
said, surely they are my people, chil-
dren that will not lie: so he Wl\8 tlieir
Saviour. In all their afilictions be
was afilicted, and tho angel of his
presence saved them. In his love
and in his pity He redeemed them,
and he bare them, and carried them
all the days of old." Is. lxiii. 8, 9.
It was thus that the words which
seem more strictly applicable to the
body of the people, are not an-
frequently applied to Christ their
head. So was it with the death of
Christ, and his resurrection there-
from. He arose on the third day. .A
day was to him, the Lord, for a thou-
sand yeara to his people. We are
now in the midst of the third thousand
years since the political death of Is-
rael took place. And of this time it
is said, " After two days he wi!l revive
us: in the third day he will raise us -
up, and we shall live in his sight.
Then shall we know, we follow on to
know the Lord : his going forth is
prepared as the morning; and be shall

Christ, the head, endured for his
people, and for Hi. work they are re-
warded.
Ramah was in the tribeship of Ben-
jamin, the brother of Joseph. Both
were the sons of Rachel; and Benj&-
min's portion bordered upon the tribe-
ship of Ephraim, the younger son of
Joseph. Ephraim was the chief'ofthe
tribes carried captive by the Assy-
rians. A sympathy might be expected
to exist between these families of Is-
rael; not merely children in common
of Israel, but also both descended
from the same mother-from Rachel,
who, whilst her soul was departing,
named him in whose tribeship was
Ramah, Benoni, Son of my Sorrow.
She is here represented as weeping
over the loss of her children, for
whom there seemed to be no prospect
of retum, when led away captive by
the powerful Assyrian monarch. Out
of the band of the enemy there ap-
peared none able or willing to deliver.
And, indeed, till our own day these
sarue children of Rachel, Ephraim and
Manasseh, have been called " The
lost." They were not, they could
not, be found. The Lord, however,
interposes his comforting voice ; and
his words are words of truth. He
bids her refrain her voice fi·om weep-
ing. Let it mther rejoice; because of
great goodnessmanifested towards the
lost sheep of tl1e bouse of Israel. Let
the eyes, which were dim with tears,
look forth in their brightness; and see
what wonders God hath accomplished
for his people. True, Israel hath of
herself done but little for which she
can expect a favourable reward: yet
doth he say, " Thy work shall be re-
warded." This is his own work,
which, in the abundance of his loving-
kindness, he is plea..ocd to impute to .
Israel: for, even ns he took oor 80f"-
rmo8, he gnve us his righteoomeaa.
His people are justified freefy by his
grace, through the redemption that is
in Christ Jesus. He hath magnified
the law, and made it honourable; and
hath said to us, " This is the work of
God, that ye believe on bin) whom he
hath sent;" and the Lord points tOr-
ward to the great deliverance from
death when he says, "They shall
come again fror;n tl1e land of the
enemy."
All that trust in His work shall
have the great reward with which the
Conqueror will return. They. are
"begotten again unto a lively hope,
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead, to an inheritance in-
corruptible and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away." And now, in the
time of the end, the sign ofth:1t greater
return will be given, in the return of
the children of Rachel to their own
border.
" There is hope in thine end,salth the
Lord, that thy children shnll come
again to their own border:" to the
very land of' Israel, which had been
promised to their fathers, shall they
return. The sympathy of the head
with the body, and of the seYe-
ral members with each other, could
scarcely be more beautifully expressed
than in the passage before us. The
same recovery of the lost children is
spoken of with regard to Jacob, Is.
xxix. 22, 23, " Therefore, thus said the
Lord, who redeemed Jacob, Jacob
shall not now be ashamed ; neither
shnll his face now wax pale; but when
he seeth his children, t.he work of my
lmnds, in the midst of him, they shall
sanctify my name, and shall snnctify
the Holy One of Isrnel, and shall fear
the God of Israel. They also thnt
erred in spirit shall come to under-
standing ; and they that murmured
shalllenrn qoctrine." The discovery
ofthe children of Joseph shall thus be
as gladdening a sight ns that of their
father was, when discovered by Jacob
in Egypt, nB having become there the
hend of the heathen. ·Joseph's bre-
thren boo erred in spirit ; but God
overruled their e\il counsels for good,
and gaye them an understanding of
those prophetic drenDls, because of
which they had so hated tl1eir brother.
And Jacob had mtmnured,and refused
~be comforted, and said, "For I will
go down unto the grave unto my son
mourning. Thus his father wept for

him f and · afterwards we find him
again complaining, " Me ye have be-
reaved of iny children. Joeeph is not;
and Simeon is not ; and ye will take
Benjamin: all these thingll are against
me." But he who had thus murmured
did learn doctrine, and was enabled to
gather his children to him before his
death, and teach them what should
befull them in the last days. Pre-
viously he had particularly bleSBed the
liOns of Joseph, and said (Gen. ch.
xiviii. 15, 16), "God, before whom my
fathers, Abraham and Isaac, did walk;
the God which fed me all my life long
unto this day; the .Angel which re-
deemed me from all evil, bless the lads;
and let my name be named on them,
and the name of my fathers, Abraham
and Isaac; and let them grow into a
multitude in the midst of the earth."
It is true that Israel, oft)le house of
.Joseph, have vury little for which to
be grateful to the unbelieving Jews.
It may be said that the 1111cestors
of the Jews conspired with the .Assy-
rians, to accomplish the destruction
of our fathers. The inhabitants of
Jerusalem rejoiced in the entire expul-
sion of Ephraim from the land oftheir
possession. They paid those heathen
allies for blotting our name from
among the nations of the earth; and
even after they had procured our ex-
pulsion, and had insulted us in our
desolate heritages, by pretending to
sanctify them from the pollutions of
which we .had there been guilty:~
even after thus having declared us ut.
terly profane, they' would have
kept us so, by preventing the messen-
gers of the King from declaring unto
us the pardon, presented in the gospel,
-that we might be saved. They would
have kept us in our state of aliena-
tion from the God of 'Our fathers.
They had taken nominal possession of
the birthright ; and would have pre-
vented the appointed heir from return-
ingto hisFather,and to the e.njoyment'
of the promised inheritance. This is
one side ofthe question: But we are
to recollect that our fathers were the
aggressors : that they had leagued
with the Syrians, Wld with them made
f
war upon the house of Judah, previ-
ous to the league formed by the latter
with the Assyrians. We were not
contented with having ourselves re-
volted from under·the house of David,
of which the appointed Heir to the
kingdom •f Israel was to come; but
we would have set aside that family
altogether, by placing upon the throne
of David one called the son of Tabe&l.
We rejected the promises made as to
the One Heir of the tribe ofJudah; as
did the Jews the promises with re-
gard to the multitudinous seed, pre-
dicted to come of Ephraim. Yet see
the forgiving grace of ~hat One Heir of
the tribe of Judah. Towards us He
hath manifested peculiar love. All
the offers of grace he hath sent to us.
To us he hath opened the view of his
coming glory. To have us cleansed
He hath poured out his very blood.
His perfect righteousness, to cover our
nakedness, hath this Heiroftlte throne
of David most richly providjld. To
us hath this One Seed of David sent
his apostles and prophets, and these
also chiefly were of Judah. From a
Jew, and through the minjstry of
Jews, the blessing in measure hath
come upon Joseph, whilst separate
from his brethren. And shall we not
be moved by the sigllt of this recon-
ciling grace in the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, who hath for us be-
come the Lamb slain? Shall we not
be moved to manifest the same for-
giveneS&-the same enriching grace,
towards those against whom our hearts
have so long been hardened? Shall
we not meet them, as He hath us, with
words of kindness and deeds of bene-
volence ? and become thus the Re-
pairer of the breach, which the Lord
hath promised the house of Israel
shall be; when the meekness, the love,
and the holiness. of our Lord shall
thus practically shine forth in his
people? So being brought into Christ,
and given one heart, and being also
givenan heart of flesh, "There is hope
in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy
children shall come again to theirown
border."

head of· them shall reatore the espa-
triated children of RacheL " There
is hope in thine end, sa.ith the Lord,
that thy children e.ball come again to
their own border."
The Psalms ofDavid contain a ..-ery
full expreBBion of the o:n:nss of the
Messiah with the people of which
He is the Prince. His sympathy in
· their sufferings, and their justification
through his righteo11Sneea; and the re-
ward ofhiawork, which through grace
they in glory shall obtain, are there
frequentlyand delightfullydweltupon.
Indeed the o:nl!lll88 of Christ with his
people is as a key to open this trea-
sure of gospel truth. It may there
also be seen that the special objects of
the Shepherd of Ierael's eare are the
children of Rachel.
Even that series of twelve BODgs,
Psalm lnviii.-lx:nix., whick be-
gins with describing the baekslid-
ings of Ephraim, and the Lord's
choosing in preference the tribe of
Judah, is most strikingly expreBBive
of his pecnliar favour for the descend-
ants ofJoseph. It is clear &om Psalm
lxxvii. that these children of promise
did not enjoy the promieed blesaings of
their election daring the former consti-
tution of the kingdom. So far &om
attaining, at that time, to what was
promised them by Jacob, " The chil-
dren of Ephraim, being armed and
carrying bows, tnmed back in the day
of battle. They kept not the cove-
nant of God, and refuse4- to walk in
his law, and forgot his works, and his
wonders that he had showed them."
And then, " Moreover he refused the
tabernacle of Joseph; and he chose
not the tribe of Ephraim ; but chose
the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion
which he loved. He chose David
also his servant; and took him from
the sheep-folds: from following the
ewM gnat 'lrith yoq he brought
him to feed Jacob hie peOple, and I.-
rae! his inheritance." Of Judah came
the chief ruler ; but the birthright
'lt'BI Joseph'a. Ita blessing& were stlll
in reserve forthepeopleohhepromile.
The subsequent desolation of the
temple, the city, and dwellitlg-placea
of Jacob, is dwelt U:pon in Ps. luix.:
during which desolation there is, as
'onder the fifth seal, the cry of the
primitive martyrs for the avenging.
When this shall take place, their ex-
pectation shall be realized, as in v. 13:
" So we thy pecple, and sheep of thy
pasture, will give thee thanks for ever.
We will show forth thy praise to all
generations."
But previous to their mauif'estation
thus, as the royal prlesthood who shall
reign on the earth in the ministration
of blessing, they had to rest until their
brethren, that should be slain as they
· were, shonld be ful1illed ; until the
harvest of Joseph and his companions
was added unto the first-fruits of J u-
dall. And accordingly, Pa. lxxx., pro-
ceeds to recognise the fulfilment of
the predihtions as to the hou.l8 of
Joseph. The good Shepherd bas come
to seek and to save that which 'lt'BI
lost. He bath foWld, not the one
sheep only, but the ninety and nine,
in the wildemeBS : and now shall be
the cry unto Him of the remnant of
his brethren, who shall return UDto
the children of Israel. " Give ear, 0
Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest
Joseph like a flock; thou that dwel-
lest between the cherubims, shine
forth before Ephraim, and Benjamin,
and Manasseh; stir up thy strength,
and come and save us." Here Ben-
. jamin, the younger eon of Rachel, is
presented in the midst of Ephraim
and Manasseh, the children of Jo-'
seph. In the midst of Samaria and
her daughters shall Jerusalem and her
daughters return; and it is to be re-
collected, that as Samaria lay between
the 'portions of Ephraim and Manas-
seh, so was Jerusalem in the portion
of Benjamin. The prayer shall he
answered in the restoration of both !

Ps. l:nxi. contains tho ilnsWllr of
GOO to the 0011of the people. It is a
-call to lay hold upon tile strength of

Lord is OIU' strength. " Sing al0t1d

joyfl\1 noise unto the G1ld of Jacob."
Let all instrumentality be mlide. use
of hi sounding' forth the praise of Je-

of Rachel are particularly noticed :
" Tllis lie ordained in Joseptr fbr a

deliverance," he wenfout thr0t1gh the
land of Egypt." He called in tr0t1ble
bct'ore, and 'ltas delivered: let him do

Hu people, but Henow calls them Bu
people: and cialls upon them, as such,
to hearken in truth unto himself.
" Hear, 0 my people, and I will tes-
tify unto thee. 0 lal'flel, if thou wilt,
hearken unto me. There shall no
strange G1ld be in thee; neither shalt
thou worship any strange God." So,
forsaklug every vain confidence, there
II abundance of blesSing in G1ld:

dued their enemies, and not have been
cut off from being a people, but have
endured for ever. " He mould also

people, in the congregation of the
mighty: he judgeth among the gods:
exposes the oppressing of the great.
' .And the call ~ow ia, " How long will
ye judge unjustly,and aocept the per-
sona of the wicked?" The demand is,
" Defend the poor and fatherless. ·Do
justice to the afllicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy. Rid them
out of the hand of the wicked." Thua
the Lord himself, ·in the appearance
of one poor and needy, appeared be-
for the Jewiah rulers, claiming simple
justice at their banda. But they
knew not the day of their visitation.
"Theyknow not,neither will they un-
derstand. They walk on in dark-
neu." · Tho greatly favoured of the
Lord would not listen to his voice.
" All the foundations of the earth are
out of courae." " I have said ye are
gods, and all of you are children of .
the Moat High." But all this will not
avail unless effectwjlly attended to:
and so it follows, " But ye ahall die
like men, and fall like one of the
princes." All this came upon theJews;
and the Lord, '\lven from Ephraim''
proud rulers, may be provoked to take
the long and much abused powerover
his people. He will hear the cry,
" Arise, 0 God, judge the earth: for
THOU shalt inherit all nations."
PI!. Jxxxili. regards that great con-
federacy against Israel, when so many
of those around thom seem to say,
" Come, and let us cut them off from
being a nation, that the name of Israel
may be no more in remembrance."
The inhabitants of Tyre, who, by
their shipping, facilitated the escape
of tho dispersed of Israel westward,
bad the destruction of Israel as a na-
tion no less in view than Assur, or
Assyria, who carried the outcasts of
Israel northward into captivity. But
as the fue burneth a wood, and as the
flame setteth the mounta.ins on fire,
so have all these ancient enemies of
Israel been conswned. They may
now be sought for, and not be found.
They have been put to shame, and
have perished; that the people whose
name was, indeed, ent off; but who
have themselves survi_ved throughout
all changes, unto the enjoyment of
the promises made by God unto their
fathers, may now indeed know, that
He whose name is Jehovah, is -the
· Most High over all the earth, in which
they bad been sown, that they might
fill the tiwe of the world with fruit.
Ps. Jxxxiv. consists of three parts.
The first, v. 1--4, expresses the long-
ing of the isolated child of Godfor the
promised rest in the bonae of his F~
ther. The second, v. 5-8, describes
his progress thereto. The third, v.
9-12, speaks of his fulness of joy,
as being received thereinto, now in
grace, and hereafter in glory. The
love of the 'brethren, who are taber-
nacles for the Moat High to dwell in,
seems to be that which is expressed
in v. 1, " How amiable are thy taber- .
naeles, 0 Lord of-Hosts!" .And then
comes that longing desire for that ful-
ness of fellowship which is to be en-
joyed, when, at the coming of the
Lord, their I...ife, they shall all ~
gathered into one blessed company,
never more to be separated : " My
soul longeth, yea, even 'fllinteth, for
the courts of the Lord. My heart
and my flesh crieth out for the living
God." .And tQen comes the com-
fortable thought that He, who hath
provided even for the sparrow ·an
house, and who bath given to the
swallow a nest for herself, will not
prove less kind to his true spiritual
worshippers. They also have their
expected rest: " Even thine alta:rs,
0 Lord of Hosts, my King, and my
God." The desirable condition of
those who shall be thus favoured, as
being received into that house which
the !:ion has gone to prepare for them,
is then stated, " Blessed are they that
dwell In tl1y house: they will be still
praising tbee." Then their progress
thereto is described: it is from strength
received from on high. In their heart
they have treasured up tho know-
ledge of God's ways, in which they
should walk. God also supplies them
with refreshment by the way: not
always in the same manner, but so as
that they need never .be in absolute
want. They go on from strength unto

strength; and company after comp1my,
they are presented before the throne,
until, in Zion, Christ in all his mem-
bers appeareth before God. This is
that for which all prnyer has been pre-
sented. " 0 Lord God ofHosts, bear
my prayer; give ear, 0 God of Jacob."
Then shall be the great supplicating,
when.the mighty shall be abased,
and the humble exalted ; when the
kingdom ~hall be the Lord's.
What shall then be the shelter of
the Israelite indeed? Evon Jesus, our
ahicld, who l1ath for us endured the
curae.-Even Christ, who will then
prove himself to be the Anointed;
through him there is an entrance into
that house in which the blessed shall
dwell, and ever be prnisillk God. And
now the reason is given why this pro-
.mised rest had been so desired, as in
· v. 10: "For a day in thy courts is.
better than a thousand. I had rather
be a door-keepeP in the house of my
God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness." And next, the reason is
nssigned for that longing desire of tllis
appearing of the Lord, as in v. 11,
" For the Lord God is a sun and shield.
The Lord will give grnce and glory:
no good will He withhold from them
that walk uprightly." And lastly,
the source and consummation of that
amiability of the tabernacles of the
Lord ofHosts is expressed: " 0 Lord
of Hosts, blessed is tho man that
trusteth in thee." ~ ·
In Ps.1xxxv. there is the recogni-
tion of the Lord's l(r8&t goodness to-
wards his people. When it is mani-
fest that the Lord hath been, indeed,
leading Joseph like a flock, ancl hath
even given them, not only to fill the
face of the world with fruit, whilst
their own land wns lying desolate
without them; but, having cleared for
them the land of their fathers, hath
also given them it in possession: then
surely the Jews will at last be
awakened, and express themselves in
the words of this Psalm: "Lord, thou
hast been .favourable to thy land:
·thou bast brought back the captivity
of Jacob. Thou hast forgiven the
iniquity of thy people; thou hast eo-
vercd all tl1eir sin. Selah. Thou
hast taken away all thy wrath ; .thou
hast turned from the fierceness of
thine anger." Then there is the con-
sideration of their own di~persed and
distressed condition, BS in contrast to
the condition of their brethren of the
house of Israel; and returning, as is
promised, Mic. ch. v. 3, unto the
children of lsrael, they cry for the
same salvation to be extended to them,
saying, " Tum us, 0 God of our sal-
vation, and cause thine anger toward
ns to cease." And, contemplating
the evils of their long dispersion, ther
cry out, " Lord, wilt thou be angry ·
with us for ever? Wilt thou draw
out thine anger to all generations ?
Wilt thou not revive us again that
thy people may rejoice in thee ? "
And now, desiring to be acquainted
with that mercy, and to be partiCipa-
tors in that salvation they have so
long, and so obstinately rejected,
they submit themselves to the teach-
ing of God, praying, " Shew us thy
meroy, 0 Lord, and grant us thy sal-
vation." Now will Judah no longer
turn a deaf ear to the call of the good
Shepherd. His resolution will be, " ~
will bear what God the Lord will
speak: for be will speak peace unto
his people, and to hls saints: bnt let
them not tum again to folly." Let
them not turn again to that idolatry
to which Israel was ~ prone ; nor
longer let them trust in their own vain
perform1mces: and this union of Israel
and Judah, in'rejection of idols, and
embrace of our Saviour, shall be the
promise of still greater good. This
union of the peOple, in the choice of
their King, shall be the immediate
precursor of that king's return in the
glory promised. " Surely his salva-
tion is nigh them that fear him, that
glory may dwell in our )Ibid." And
now there is the joyful contemplation
ofthegospel-ofGod'sway ofshewing
mercy, with which tloy had expressed
the desire of beooming acquainted:
" Mercy and truth are met together ;
righteousness and peace have kissed \
each other." This has been mani-
fested in the work of Christ for ns,

" For thou, Lord, art good, and ready

the salvation promised : " 0 turn

Thus speaks Jsra.el: for now he recog-
nisca his llDity with Him who became

cob, even with the Son of MliiY, tho
lwldmaid of the Lord, who shall take

Ps. lxxxvii. ~tppea.rs to contemplate

Lord who ever liveth, that became, by
his death for sin, tho sure Foundation
upon which Pis people'• faith might
rest.-lle, the Lord, notwithstanding
all the murderous malice of the Jew•
against him, " still loveth the gate•
of Zion more than all the dwellinga
of Jooob." He hath ch()Ben it for his
habitation, saying," Here will I dwell;
for I have desired it." It ,is to be
the city of the great King. When he
will come as the chief corner-stone,
there to complete the great work of
redemption, it is at Zion he will more
especially manifest himself to the in·
habitants of the earth. There will
he fully overcome, and there will he
establish bit throne ; and tluther shall
all the nations of the eerth that re-
main go up, from year to year, to

pear to be'long deferred: even 811 Wll8
the fulfilment of the promise to Abra-
ham. . The Lord, to keep his promise
in remembrance, hath not been back-
ward in giving tokens of his will and
power to deliver: nnd ao it is said, " I
will make mention of Rahab and Ba-
bylon to them that know me." He
will bring to their remembrance the
releaae from Egyptian bondage. When
he cut Rahab in pieces, and led them
through the Red Sea, in which the
Egyptians were drowned ; and, turn-
ing from Egypt, which wu towards
the south of the land, he will point
to Babylou, which wu JIID1'e in the
northern direction, and speak of the
rel~'of the Jews from their seventy
yean' eaptivity there, a pledge of the
restor&t.ion of &11 lsr&el Such a de-
liverance is he yet to &CCOIIlplish,
from under the feet of that image of
which Babylon wu the head, 88 that
even the deliverance from Egypt shall
thereby be completely eclipsed. And
he will c&ll Philisti& and Tyre, who
h&d fllll'ly taken• possesaion of the sen
cout of Israel's inheritance-He will
c&ll them,with Ethiopia,who &lao hath
encroachedupon theirinheritancefrom
the other side, to look to tho birth-
pl&ce of Him, who, &!though esteemed ·
&& a worm, and no man, one that might
be crushed with impunity,was yet the
rightful Heir of that inheritance upon
which they had encroached,-the Sa-
viour of ·the people whom Egypt and
Babylon had enslaved. Behold, Beth-
lehem, though little 11111ong the thou-
sands of Judah, "thiswas born there."
But the birth of the Saviour ofIamel
was two-fold: and it is in reference to
his birth from the grave, when r&ised
in reaorrection life and glory, that the
Father llllid, &a in the second Pa&!m,
" This d&y have I begotten thee." ·
And it is by his resurrection from the
dead that we are begotten again unto
a lively hope. That birth ofthe Hu~
band of the outc88t woman wu at
Zion; and accordingly it.follows here,
" And. of Zion it shall be said, the
man, even the Man, w&a born iu her."
So it may be rendered; and the word
translated Jfan is the same which is
used, when, in H~ ch. ii 16, it ia
said,." And it shall come to pus in
that day, that thou ah&!t c&ll me
Iw "-my companion husband. H•
of whom Pilate said, " Behold: the
man," He who loved the church, and
gave himself for it, He was born
there, not indeed in humiliation into
this mort&! existence, u at Bethlehem,
but in resurrection power and glory.
He had given himselfto sleep the aleep
of death that his wife might have life
in and from him. And that which
was thus ao richly begun in grace
sh&!l be consummated in glory: "The
Highest himself sh&ll establish her"...-
sh&!l bnild her up on that sure Foun-
dation, ao that sbe sh&!l never be
confounded any more. This Man
ab&!l be our peace. The merit of the
work which He wrought, as coming in
the fl'esh, will be reckoned to each
of the people that sh&ll bo brought
forth to enjoy the redemption of the
purchased possession. And ao it is
said, " The Lord sh&!l cotuit, when he
writeth up the peopl!l, This wu born
there." In the right of Him, the de-
spised Jesus, who there was born, will
possession be given of both the hea-
venly.and the earthly inheritance.
The lastverse ofihis Pa&!m appenra
not very clear in our tr&nal&tion.
That proposed in Bate's Critica
Hebl'lll!l appean to be much more &e •
cording to the scope of the p&SS&ge.
It requires not fotcing of the origin&!
words : " And the prinCJ!l& 811 dend
men shall be, &11 that have oppressed
thee;" or, in other words, &11 the
.princes that have been using oppres-
sion in the midst of thee sh&!l be &a
. dead men-having no more power to
oppress. The Lord &lone sh&ll be ex-
&!tcd in that d&y : and lsr&el, yea,
and the creature itself, sh&!l exult in
the glorious liberty of the aona of
God. The proud oppressor shall be
u the dust of the summer threshing-
floor; they sh&!l be swept away, and
be no more found, whilst Zion shall
be established for ever.

carried a:.ray into hopeless captivity
by the .Assyrians, and who are re-
ported 88 saying, in their miserably
broken condition, Ezek. XII:X'rii. 11,
" Our bones are dried; our hope is
loet; we are cut off for our parts,"
which three sentences express the
substance of the three parts of this
Psalm. " Our bones are dried," is
paraphrased, v. 1-7: as when it is
said, v. 3, 4, " For my soul is full of
troubles, and my life draweth nigh
unto the grave. I am counted with
them that go down into the pit. I am
88 a man that AatA no strength."
2. " Our hope is lost," is the im~
port of the second part of this Psalm,
v. 8-10," Thou hast put away mine
acquaintance fn.r from me; thou hast
made me an abomination unto them.
I am shut UJr-l cannot come forth.
Mine eye mourneth by reason of af-
fliction. Lord, I have called daily
upon thee. I have stretched out my.
hand~ unto thee." And so hopeless
was the prospect placed before them
that thus was the cry of the true Is-
raelite, w~t contemplating the pro-
mises made unto the fathers; but they
saw no likelihood of their fulfilment.
"Wilt thou shew wonders to the
dead ? Shall the dead arise and
P.rnise thee? "
3. " We are cut off for our parts,"
is enlarged upon, , v. 11-18. The
loving kindness, the faithfulness, the
wonders, the righteousness of the God
of Israel are recognised ; but there
seemed to be an utter separation from
their enjoyment and manifestation in
thecase ofthe outcasts of Israel ; from
whom the very name of Israel was .
taken: they being cast out into the
midst of heathen darkness; given to
the teeth ofthe destroyer, and laid, as
it were, in the grave. And thus their
plaint was unto the Lord: " Lord,why
castest thou off my. soul ? Why
hidest thou thy face from me? I am
afflicted and ready to die from my
youth up. I suffer thy terrors. I
am distracted. Thy fierce wtath
goeth over me. Thy terrors have cut
me off:" The waters of the river,
strong and many, even the king of
.Assyria, and all hisglory, had been al-
lowed to come up, and sweep them
away. " They came round about me
all the day like waters. They com-
passed me about together. Lover and
friend hast thou pu' far from me-
mine acquaintance into darkneas."-
Thus lost were the children of pro-
mise:•who yet have grown, as was
predicted, into a multitude ·of na--
tions; and now are they found in the
place and circumstances predicted, in
the midst of the third thousand years'
since their being lost as Israel. As
entering into sympathywith their case,
as described in this Psalm, our Lord
was laid in the grave until the third
day. Nor will the King appen.r, to
take possession of the kingdom, until
they are raised up, and are prepared
to enjoy it with him.
Ps. lxxxix. is divided into five por-
tion~: the first two of which, v.1-37,
speak of the glory of Chnst and •his
kingdom ; and the last three, v.
38-51, as clearly intimate the appa-
rent failure of the promises made with
regard to the seed of David. He will
not take possession of his kingdom
until the people of promise, a8 made
one with him who was made one witlL
them, are prepared to. enjoy it with
him. The subject is briefly stated in
the first four verses. M&y Israel, as
one man, soon be heard~ say," I will
sing ofthe mercies ofthe Lord for ever;
with my.mouth will I makeknown thy
faithfulness to all generations." The
laying of the Foundation, &s before
noticed, is the security that the build-
ing shall proceed, until it is crowned
with the glory promised. " Mercy
s!mll be bnilt' up for ever; thy faith-
fulness shalt thou establish in the very
heavens." The throne of David shall
be establishedin strength. For the Son
of David, the . covenant is sure :
" Thy seed will I establish for ever,
&nd build up thy tarone to all gene-
rations." .
In the second part, the name of this
promised Seed, who is also God over
all, blessed for ever, is declared. He
is first (seever. 5-13), tbe"Wonder-
ful," who hath dealt, and who will

He is, thirdly, v. 19-25, spoken
of as the ·Mighty One, upon whom
onr help is laid; it is He who bears
c~on up; and yet He is also one

CONCL'C810N OF THE J'OUBTH Tlll1NDJ:IL 91
Does there eeem to be a union of the ·
heavenly with the eartbly-ilf the
city not made with bands, which ahall
dbseend out of heaven from God;
with Jeruaalem, built up on her
own little hill, when it is lllid, "ll
shall be established for ever as the
moon; and as a fai~ful witness ill
heaven." Then indeed there will be
THE SIGHT 01!' PEACE: "In the mount
of the Lord it shall be seen."
The apparent failure of this cove-
nant in the mere natmal seed of David
is recognised, v. 38-45; so that we
must look beyond and furward, for
_the accomplishment of the promise,
which, whatever fuilure may have
taken place as to the type, shall most
surely be accomplished in the proper
subjects and objects thereof. The
long 'Waiting for that which, as to the
fulness, can only be enjoytlli in resur-
rection life is then intimated, v.
46--48. The what, and what man-
ner of time, to which the prophecy
applies being ascertained, the Lord is
then put in rem!lmbrance of hi!! former
loving-kindnesses, whil:h l!ave to be
called to niindj and of the covenant
with David, established in Him who
is the Truth; ty~d it is shld, " Remem-
ber, Lord, the reproach of thy ser-
'vauts." The sympnthy of the body,
whereby they bear each the other's
burdens-whereby they each, as did
the high-priest, bear the people of the
Lord on their heart before Him, after
the example of Christ in whom they
are gathered into oneness, is then ex-
pressed, wben it is said, " I do bear in
my boeorn all the mighty people."-
There is a sympathy with the re-
proach which hath been cast upon the
name of Christ-with the shame to
which his name hath been put in the
place of his feet, which shall yet be
made glorious. The united prayer of
Christ and his people will be heard;
and the cry of Cblist in his members,
ascending thl'Ough their exalted head,
will be heard on high ; and they shall
have occasion to say, " Blessed be the
Lord for evermore." And tl1e truth of
the promise will be acknowledged on
earth and in heaven. " l\men and

HAVING before promised the recovery
of the lost children of Isre.el ; and
having specially spoken comfort tc
Rachel, the mother of Joseph, ofwhose

Ephraim's recognition of his Father,

upon his Father's good pleasure; o.nd
his Father,whoseeye has ever followed
him in all his wanderings, sees the
condition of his son, and his ear is

are an acknowledgment of his utter
inability todoanythinggoodasofhim-

nesa are exposed to his view, IU}d he
begins to be subdued.- His Father
bad declared, " The ox knoweth his
owner:" "but Israel doth not know."
And he acknowledges the condemna.-
tion jnst, saying, " Thou hast chas-
tised me, and I was chastised as a
bullock unaccustomed," or untaught:
The bullock, or ox, was the standard
of Ephraim; and he confesses that this
animal, even in its untaught state, was
a fitting representation of his condi-
tion. The Lord has been punishing
him for seeking a conformity to the .
nations around: he sought to be like
them, in national policy, and also in
religion; and the Lord punished him
by giving him both the place and the
name of the Gentiles, casting him out
of the land, and taking from him the
pame of Isrnei, Hos. ch. i. 6-9. But
Ephraim 'considered it not. He still
went on frowardly-still indulged in
worldly conformity, and want of con-
sideration as to the dealings of God
with regard to him. The means which
Goo hath given him, whereby to pro-
vide for the poor, and glorify his
Maker, he had used for the grntifica.-
tion of his o'\tn vanity, pleasure, and
pride; and thought it a wonderful self-
sacrifice if he bestowed a miserable
pittance upon the objects for which
his wealth had been bestowed upon
him, or rather for which such trea.-
sures had been intrnsted to his'CS.I'C.
Nay, he even takes those troo.surcs,
and endows therewith what he ac-
knowledges to be superstition and ido-
la.try, through the cowardly fear of
not ha.ving the a.rm of the wicked to
trust to In the day of battle.-Ah!
this trust in man-this departing from
the Living God-this must be re-
pented of.
In Hosea, who dwells 8o much upon
the case of Ephraim, it is sa.id, ch. x.
1, 2, " Israel is 11n empty vine; he
bringeth forth fruit unto himself: ac-
cording to the multitude of his fruit,
he hath increaaed the altars-accord-
ing to the goodnesa of his land, they
have made goodly images. Their
heart is divided: now shall they be
foundfaulty: he shallbreak downtheir
altars-he shall spoil their images."
ver. 4. " They have spoken words,
swearing falsely, in J;Daking a cove-
nant: thns judgment sprinf.e_th up as
hemlock in the furrows of the field."
ver. 12, " Sow to yourselves in
righteousnesa; reap in mercy-break
up your fallow ground; for it is time
to seek the Lord, till he come and
ra.irr righteousness upon you." Eph-
raim will at length see the folly of his
own way, and the wisdom ofan entire
return unto his Father : and, con~
scions of his own ignorance, weakness,
and proneness to err, he will at length.
be prevailed 1Jpoi to throw himself
upon the free mercy of his God and
!<'ather-the forgiving grace-the
almighty power of Jehovah, saying,
" Turn thou me, and I shall be
tumed, for thou art the Lordmy God."
-There is a forsaking every false
ground of confidence, and a taking the
Lord himself as the Portion of his
people; and as He who can, and who
will, put forth power in those that
make Him their defence, Ephraim will
yet in truth, in the spirit of adoption,
claim the L01'<i as his God.-As tM
LoRD, who only is able to direct-as
Gon, who alone ismighty to deliver;
and, entirely distrusting his own wis-
dom and power,he will make those of
the Most High his own: which can
alone be done in the right of the Re-
deemer. To strengthen in this wise .
resolution, there is, then, a musing
over pllSt experience--there is a re-
cognition ofthe imperfection ofall om
past turnings unto God. Thet·o was
a turning when we· forsook the wor-
ship of Odin and otlter new gods, and
embraced Christianity; but this was
fast getting into the corrupt form of
Popery, and WIIS thus a repentance
that needed to be repented of: which

struction can be oonveved to the

be has attained, and which be has
:tmtionally recognised, he has been un-
faithful. Through the fear of those
he has overcome, he falters in the pro-
test in which his God hath supported
and prospered him. Well may Eph-
raim be astonished, ashnmed, yea,
even confounded, at his so long re-
taining that spirit and conduct for
which he was reproved in the days of
.his youth, as in IJ,psea, ch. xi. 3-8:
" I taught Ephraim aleo to go, taking
them by their anns; but they knew
not that I healed them. I drew them
with the cords of a man, with bands
of love. And I was to them as they
that take off the yoke on their jaws,
and I laid meat unto them. He shall
not return into the land of Egypt;
but tJJe Assyrian shD.ll be his king, be-
cause they refused to return; And the
sword shall abide on his cities, and
shall consume his branches, and de-

And my people ate bent to back-
sliding from me: though they called
them to the Most .High, none' at all
would exalt Him. How shall I give
. thee up Ephraim? Ho.w shall I de-
lifer thee, Israel? How shall I make
thee as Adrnah? H0111 shall 1 set
thee as Zeboiim? My heart is turned
within me. My repentings are kindled
together." And when Ephraim shall
be made sensible of all this ; and be
made truly to confess his 'Worthless-
ness, weakness, and want of wisdom-
when he shall come to some under-
standing of the multiplied instructions
of his Father, and of his own utter
stupidity, under the Lord's dealings
with him, both in mercy and in judg-
ment- when he shall cast himself
upon his God, in humble repentance,
and for undeserved grace· then shall
be know the truth of his Father's wel-
OO!lle, in recognition of his returning .
son, to whom he gl.ves tlie place of
the ftrst-botn, saying," Ephraimf"-

the Father, as becoming adorned With

of his God and Saviour~" For since
I spnke against him, I do earnestly
remember him still. Therefore my
bowels are troubled for hhn. I will
surely have mercy bpon him, saith
the Lord." It will be found that,
throughout the Old Testament pro-
phecies, ev'en after Epbraim was to
appearance lost-left to destructiOn
under the hands of his enemiu, he
wns not forgotten, but most earnestly
remembered by the God of" Israel, who
hath had compassion on him in his
low estate, even so M to give the Son
ofhis love Into our world, to seek and
to !!live that which wa., LOST; il:nd eo
as to send more especially to him the
ofl"ers of his grtcl!, and the bounties of
his providence. Northwestward, ~- ·
conling to spellial direction from the
days of olil, have come the.me8$(1Ilgets
of peace, with, in tbeir hands, the
Book of Remembrance, testifying of
the Lord's gracious purposes witlr re-
gard to his people, and sp~g be-
fore us the riches of his New Cov.e-

his own blood, providing the fulnm
of blessing, for those w:&o know they
were lost, and who, having no confi·
dence in tl1e flesh, are willing to be
received back into favour, and fitted
for the glorioui kingdom of otn" God
upon the terms of sovereign grace.
Yea God hath ever remembered
Ephraim in tendcmes5, nnd bath been
extending to him loving-kindness,
although he hath perceived it not.
Truly may Israel, as looking-back
upon all the way in which the Lord
hath led them, exclaim, " His mercy
enduretli for ever." And that mercy
will be yet more abundantly bestowed:
in reference to which are the words
(Jer. :nxi. 20), " I wtn 8111-ely have

mercy upon him, saith the Lord."-
So saying, he falleth on his neck, and
kisseth him, and bestows upon him
the ·blessing of the First-born, ac-
knowledging him as his son, who was
dead, and is alive spin-who was
lost, and is found. Thus delightful
and full will be the recognition of the
Father by the son, and of the son by
the,Father, when the son shall know
and acknowledge himself, as, in him-
self, utterly lost. Our safety is as be-
ing made one with that Son who
abideth for ever-as wholly taking
refuge in the Lord our God.
The same prophet who so clearly
foretold the utter taking away of Is-
rael whilst Judah would bo preserved;
and also the taking away from Eph-
raim the very name belonging to his
people, Hos. ch. i. 6-9; and who so
strikingly describes, as we have seen,
the shame of his youth,-that same
prophet ends witli an invitation re-
markably expressive of the kindness
with which the father will receive the
returning prodigo.J, Hos. :x.iv. I: " 0
Israel! return unto the Lord th;v God,
for thou bast fallen by thine iniquity.
Take with yon words, and turn to the
Lord. Say unto llim, Take away all
iniquity, and receive us graciously:
110 will we render the calves of our
lips." The calves, which were apt re-
presentations ofEphraim's foolisbneBB,
and which were kissed in idolatrous
worship by him, as if they bad been
gods, these-even all their modem
counterparts, will he rendered np.-
Neitherwill there be any more a trust
in man, or creature deliverance ofany
Jqnd: "ABBhur shall not save us; we
will not ride upon horses." Neither
to Assyria, on the lei\ hand; nor
down into Egypt, on the right, will we
go for deliverance: " Neither will we
say any more to the work of our
hands, Y'e are our gods, for in thee
the fatherless findeth mercy." ·
Ephraim will have said, " Though
Abraham he ignorant of us, and Israel
acknowledge us not, yet doubtless
thou art onr Father." And the Fa-
thtn:..will have so received in bleuing
this folneas of nations, promised to
come of Ephraim, as that "All Israel"
will desire to he partakers of the sal-
vation enjoyed by the first-born. And
th'e Lord promises to heal their back-
aliding, to love them freely, and to be-
stow upon them beauty, strength, and
fulness of blessing. And thrice is
Lebanon spoken of as descriptive of
his case. And this, it may he re-
marked, is almoat the only part ofthe
land which, till near the time of Ie-
rnel's return, has been left under any
careful cultivation. . .
Ephraim, in order to lead thus in
blet~sing, must he clear and decided in
'his protest against that which the
Lord hath resolved utterly to abolish.
" Ephtaim shall sa~ What ht.ve I todo
any more with idols?" and the Father
saith, " I have beard, and observed
him." Ephraim saith, "I am like a
green fir-tree "-fair, but unfruitful.
This be makes his complaint, and he
longs to bring forth fruit unto God,
and the God of his salvation replies,
" From me is thy fruit found,"-from
me thou art worthy of thy name-
l<'ruitful. Soon, indeed, may Ephraim
bring forth·fruit meet for repentance.
Soon may his :father undo that which
was done, when he had not mercy
upon them, but utterly took them
away. " I will surely have mercy
upon him," implies the revocation of
that sentence of expulsion from the
land. As being taught the fear of
the Lord, which is the beginning of
wisdom, a fnl1 permission-yea, kind
eommand, is given to the outcaite of
Israel to return, to where more espe-
cially the reft'llsJrlng and the fruitful-
!KlSB in God, are promised to be be-
stowed-" Who is wise, and he shall
understand these things ?-prudent,
and he shall know them? for the ways
of theLord are right, and the just shall
walk in them; but the transgresaors
shall fall therein." Soon may Eph-
raim cease to be an unwise son; and
know that the Lord is indeed a Father
to Israel, and that Ephraim ishis first..
born.

THE people recognised as; in Christ,
the Lord's first-bon1, having been
brought to true repentance, to a pre-
plll"lltion of heart, by fully submitting
unto the free grace of God in the
Gospel, will be assuredly given the

putteth his trust in me shall possess
the land, and inherit my holy moun-
tain, and shall say, Cast ye up! east

of removing both the spiritual and

and joyful return of the great body of
the people, who shall be privileged to
honour the Lord in the land, where
he hath been so long put to shame;
there hath the Lord been put to

mightily, and cause them to be instru-
mental in their own, and one ano-

to the preparing a highway for our

will make the rough places plain, and

being prepared for this work. Al-
ready are our people moat remarkably
in poeaession of Ule means for effect-
ing ilie object desired. And atlength
Ephraim will give himaelfto iliework ;
bnt, aa·well, the people generally are
oalled upon to be active in their own
deliverance. And in this iliey may,
for some time, be employed wiiliout
knowing ilie full deaign of ilie work
in which they are engaged.
The words " Set iliee up waymarb,
make thee high heaps," seem more
especially to refer to the immediate
preparation for Israel's return; when
their attention, as now, was to be di-
rected to the construction ofhighways,
whereby safe and expeditious convey-
ance may be obtained, through quar-
ters previously unfrequented ; and
whereby places, otherwise distant, may
be brought into euy communication
wiili each other, for their mutual ad-
vantage, and ilie general diffusion of
knowledge.
This haili been deemed a chief de-
sideratum in these last days; and to-
wards the attaiument of it men have
been impelled by an irresistible im-
pulse. The engineer hath contributed
his skill, aud the man of bnsin888 his
commercial ability, and the people
their labour, and the government its
encouragement, and capitslists the
funds necessary for carrying forward
the enterprise. Comparatively few,
however, it is to be feared, have been
thinking of anything farther, than
the serving their own selfish ends-
the forwarding ilieirown narrow views
ofcommercial policy. Few have been
thinking that they were in the divine
purpose, preparing a highway for our
God.
At length attention will in truili be
given to the command, " Set thine
heart toward the highway." This
seems to be the same which is ad-
verted to, 18&. xix. 23-25, " In that
day there shall be an highway out of
Egypt to Assyria; and the Assyrian
shall come into Egypt, and the Egyp-
tian into Assyria, and the Egyptians
shall serve with the Assyrians. In
that day shall Israel be the third with
g
Egypt and wiili Assyria, even a bless-
ing in the midst of the earth; whom
the Lord of Hosts shall bleas, saying,
Blessed be Egypt my people, and
Assyria the work of my hands, and
Israel mine inheritance." There is
likely to be a highway from Egypt to
ilie Gulf of Akab&; iliere meeting ilia
packets from India and eastern Africa,
and thence paasing up ilie valley of
El Ghor, to a junction wiili a line
running up the valley of Jezreel, from
Acre, on ilie Mediterranean ; and
meeting also one from Damascus and
ilia region beyond; and wherefrom a
line may be drawn eastward to India,
and westward, down Asia Minor, to
meet the great European system of
railways.
These may converge to ilie point
unto which was the great preaching
of ilie Apostle : His course was from
Jerusalem round about unto Illyri-
cnm, Rom. xv. 19, at ilie north-west-
ern extremity of which, is Trieste.
Upon attaining this point from north-
western Europe, the passage may be
either by sea, to Acre; or by land, aa
already described. A line along the
coast from near Antioeh to .Acre, and
from Egypt to ilie same, may also, of
course, be ultimately laid down.
" The way ilion wentest," describes
the course of the great highway. Is-
rael were in their infancy, as a nation,
brought out of Egypt by Moses; and
under Joshua they were led into the
land. They afterwards, as to the
great body of them, were carried into
Assyria, whilst the escaped passed b;v
ilie shipping of Tyre down the Medi-
terranean, to the coasts of Europe,
unto which also those that were taken
captive into Assyria were at\erwards
to come, and where ilie Lord was to
be to them, as he haili been indeed to
us, a " Little Sanctuary," Ezek. xi.
16. In what part of the world hath
the Lord brought a people so near
unto Himself, as to the enjoyment of
that which was more especially the
subject of new covenant blessing, as
in the countries where we have come?
It was in this direction that ilie feet

espeolally aent. See how directly
Paul waaled of the Spirit Into Europe,
being allowed to turn neither to the
left band nor to the right, until be
pMaed over Into our quarter of the
globe, Acts, xvL 6-12. There at
Philippi he was il18trumental in oom-
menolng that good work, which be
confidently expected God would per-
form Ulltil the day of Jesus Christ.
(Phil. i. 6 ; compare Jer. xuili. 14,)
When Israel are foUlld the work of
his bands, new created after the image
ofhim who now calleth us to glory
and virtue ; it will be seen that the
Apostle did not run in vain, neither
labour In vain. The primitive
Christians in the south-east ofEurope,
held forth the word of life towards us
that were beyond, In the north-west,
Phil. !i. 16. It waa in this direction
also that Paul passed by eea, after he
bad preached the Gospel to the Gen-
tiles, and when be was being brought
before kings for the name's sake of
Christ: in addition to which, be was
to beer the name of the Lord before
the children of Israel, Acts, ix. 15.
These were chiefly to be foUlld in the
west, 118 is farther evident. from the
Apocalypse-the UnveUing.
The election of Israel are at length

understood, as to present privilege and
duty, is an invitation to the people of
promise to return-1m Invitation to
appear, with holy devotedness, In the
place where be hath purposed to de-
stroy the face of the covering cast
over all people, and the vail that is
spread over all nations, Isa. xxv. 7.
Then shall be the Apocalypse-the
rending of the vall.
Two things may safely be inferred
from the words we have been consi-
derlng:-First, that the people ad-
dressed are a people In pouellion of
the meant of constructing a highway
snob as Ia required. It ia acoepted
aecordlng to that which a man hath,
and not aooordiug to what he
bath not. Secondly, that the people
so furnished with the means at pre-
paring a highway to, and through the
land, are the very people of Israel
who previously went that way, in
which they are now to be fonnd, as
returning. But they have been so
long scattered, that they have forgot-
ten their resting-place, Jer. I. 6.
They know not that it is theirs, or
that they have any oall of God to go
thither. To meet their case the word
requires to be very expressive, and it
actually is so-the people already
identified are directly addressed as
Israel, and are recognised as those
unto whom rightfully belong the cities
of Israel. And these they are oalled
upon to re-inhabit. " Turn again, 0
virgin of Israel 1 turn again to these
thy cities."
Men pursuing their mere secular
interests, may see it for their advan-
tageto produce much greater facilities
for communication between the eaat
and the west, than as yetexiet. From
the north-west of Europe, through
European Turkey, and Asia Minor, to
the Euphrates, and then down aloug
that river, in the direction of India,
a great highway is at length likely
to be opened up. This would lead
through the land of Shinar, where
wickedness is yet to have a bouse
built for her, Zech. v. 11. There the
god of this world may yet be paid the
mostIntense catholic devotion. There
may meet the converging lines of
highway from the 801ltb and the west.
The passengers from Europe will have
a strong temptation to proceed along
that common road or highway, in
pursuit of the gain, the glory, or the
pleasures of this world. But not
only shall be there an highway, a
road for all ; there shall also be a way
"And it shall be called the way of
holiness;" or the separatedway, as dis-
tinguished from the common road or

receiviug baok the outcasts of Israel
to the blessing promised,-seeing it is
so secured to them in Him, who hath
for us endured the curse, and ful6lled
&11. righteoumeu.
God bath given assured evidence
that He means what He says; and
they who in this persuasion !ay hold
upon his word, and treat it as a rea-
lity, being led forth thereby into the
manifestation of his truth in the land,
shall find his promise sure, what-
ever trialstheymay in thefirstinstance
be called UpOn to endure. Not onegood
thing ofall that God bath spoken, will
be found awantiug to the children of
promise, the numerous offspriug of
outcast Israel, who, lly adoption,
through grace, in the Son of God, will
be constituted sons of God. As as-
euredly as the One Seed of the tribe
of Judah bath come, to be the glorr of
his people Israel, so truly shali be
brought forth unto Zion the multitu- ,
dinoua seed, who will glory in his
DIU!Ie, and be regarded as his glory.
Let it be again remarked that the
Lord remonstrates with Israel on ac-
count of her backwardness in obeyin~
his voice, as to the promised return,
which seems to imply, that, after the
time she might have returned, she is
still found absent from her own pro-
per home. Her Lord invites her into
his land. True, she bath forsaken
the Lord, and forfeited &11. right to
the possession of the inheritance pro-
miaed to the fathers. But it is not in
her own right that she is invited to
the cities of Israel as hers. It is in
the name of the ri~htful Heir, the
Mighty to save. It 1s in the right of
Him in whom the promises are &11.
secured to Israel. In giving this new
and marvellous thing in the land,
God bath given us the assurance that
&11. the promises of God, however
great, and however difficult ofaccom-
plishment, He will most assuredly
fulfil. IfHe could make the virgin's
womb to oomp(ISSthe Man, who is the
Mighty One, whom the heaven of hea-
vens cannot contain, then can there be
no doubt that the land of Israel will
be rendered capable of 8D8taining
the multitudes of ita promised inha-
bitants.
Let us be induced to have really,
and in all things, oar faith and hope
in God.
It seet118 to be with regard to thle
promiaed retarD of Israel to her own
cities, that we have the a881I1'8IIC8
given, Zecb. i. 17. " Cry yet," that
is in addition to the re-peopling of the
land by the Jews after their three-
I!C01"8-8Dd-ten years' captivity in Ba-
bylon, referred to, v. 12-16. "Cry
yet, saying, My cities, through pros-
perity shall yei be spread abroad; and
the Lord sh&ll yet comfort Zion, and
shall yet choote Jeruaa.lem again."
The invitation is earnestly given, oh.
ii. 6, 7, " Ho, ho, and flee from the
land of the north, saith the Lord."
And then the oooasion for the double
call, " Ho, ho" is given " For I have
spread you abroed as the four winds
of heaven, saith the Lord." And the
need of fleeing from the land of the
north is intimated: judgment is to be
executed upon Babylon there, " De-
liver thyself, 0 Zion, that dwellest the
daughter of Babylon." And then is
intimated the cause of the m88811ge be-
ing so especially sent to the north
country: It was after backsliding Is-
rael, who yet are to prove his glory.
" For thus saith the Lord of hosts,
After the glory hath .he sent me unto
the nations that spoiled you; for he
that toucheth you, toucheth the apple
of his eye. For behold I will shake
mine hand upon them: and they shall
be a spoil to their servants: and ye
shall know that the Lord of hosts hath
sent me." Others may have the
worldly spoil, but Israel are to seize
upon the true riches, the knowledge
of Christ as the Sent of the Father,
the good part which shall not be taken
from them. " Sing and rejoice, 0
daughter of Zion; for, loI I come, and
I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith
the Lord." This restoration will not
be merely of the remnant of a nation:
" Many nations will be joined to the
Lord in that day, and sh&ll be my
people (Ammi), and I will dwell in
the midst of thee, and thou shalt know

that the Lord of hosts hath sent me
unto thee."
The many nations to come of out-
cast Israel, having been recognised as
the Lord's people, it follows, "And
the Lord shall inherit Judah his por-
tion in the Holy Land, and shall
choose Jerusalem again." Now will
the Lord be exalted, " Be silent, 0 all
fiesh, before the Lord, for He is raised
up out of his Holy Habitation."-
Then when the prayers of our High
Priest, for the unity of his body shall
have been answered, will the world be
indeed called upon to believe that He
is the Sent of the Father. See John
xvii. 20, 21.
That the people who are to be the
glory of the house of David, and the
glory of the .inhabitant~ of Jerusalem,
might not magnify themselves against
Judah, the Lord, Zech. xii. 7, did
save the tents of J ndah first, or at the
beginning: The Gospel was first pro-
claimed to theshepherds ofBethlehem,
to the fishermen of Galilee, and there-
after also, for some time, the gospel
was preached first to the poor of the
fiock of Judah. But the first shall
be last, and the last first. Judah,
although too willing to exchange his
expectation of blessing in the land for
the certainty of a mess of pottage out
of it, may not yet altogether have re-
linquished his claim to exclusive pos-
session and haughty pre-eminence.-
He may at first be angry, and refuse
to come in; but let those who have
been made wise wtto salvation carry
forth to him the Father's message,
and invite him also, to a full participa-
tion of the blessing. The Lord will
poor upon the house of David, and
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,-
upon the children she is to have after
havinglosttheother,-uponthem,even
upon the restored children of Joseph,
He will pour the spirit of grace and of
supplication; and, saith the Redeemer
of Israel, " They shall look upon ME
whom they have pierced ; and they
shall mourn for him," for Judah,-for
the brethren according to the fiesh Qf
Him whom our sins have pierced.-
Jerusalem shall be in bitterness for
Judah, as one that is in bitterness for
his first-born; and the Lord will hear
and answer. . Our God hath not only
appointed that Israel should be blessed
in the One Seed, Christ,-He hath
also appointed that Ephraim should
especially be active in the reception of
the blessing, and likewise in the dis-
tribution thereof among his brethren,
yea, to all the families of mankind,
but especially to the Jews. 'l'he Jews
shall yet rejoice to be found under the
protection of their outcast brethren,
not only out of the land, but also
when the Lord shall bring again their
captivity. Jerusalem, as we learn
from Is. xlix. 18-21, is, in the resto-
ration, to be chiefly inhabited by the
children of Joseph-the same who be-
fore complained of the straitness of
their portion, Josh. :xvii. 14-18.
These are appointed to be unto her for
a clothing of beauty and glory. They
will not only ask to obtain blessing
for themselves, but especially for Ju-
dall. They will pray over his state,
and long for his conversion, and labour
that the remnant of the brethren of
Him in whom they are themselves
blessed, may have a full participation
in the blessings ofthe first-born. They
will labour, not with cruelty ()r craft,
but in the patient persevering mani-
festation of kindness and of truth;
and they shall not labour in vain.

whom they had been east out of it.-
He hath been a Shepherd to Israel:

which shall feed them with knowledge
and underetanding. He will have sa-
tiated the soul of the priests with fat-
ness; and his people shall be satisfled
with his goodness. The blessing, both
temporal and spiritual, will have been
bestowed upon them. The promised
blessing will have oome upon the land,
ao that the needful corn, and wine,
and oil, will not be denied them; and
he will have revealed unto them the
abundance of goodness and truth.-
And thi.llaudden and entire change in
the land, and upon the people, will,
in the sight of all nations, be u a sigu
that cannot be spoken against.
The resurrection of the dry bones
of All Iarael, and the change which
ahall have puaedupon Judah, the Rem-
nant of Isrul; and the rc-union in the
land of those that were lost and those
that remain, u being now made the
Lord's one people, whereby the coming
of their King will in power be heralded
unto all the ends of the earth, will In-
deed be a sigu-a sigu of the speedy
resurrection of the saints, who have
fallen uleep in Jesne-a e1gu of the
change that shall paea upon those
of the Lord'a people who shall remain
unto the oommg of the LOrd. These
together will be caught up to meet
the Lord In the air, and so ahall be
ever with the Lord: when the Lord,
In the diapenaation of the fulnen of
times, will gather together In one,
both the thinga which are In heaven,
and the things which are on earth,
even in Him.-In the breaking down
the middle wall of partition, which
etood between thoee that were out
afar olf, and the remnant left nigh,-
in making both one upon earth, He
hath given a sigu of the union which
ahaU thereafter speedily and viaibly
lOll
be elfeoted between the earth and the
heaven, when the saints, in their glo-
rious dwelling, that shall than desoend
out of heaven from God, will be given
the dominion, under the whole heaven.
Is it not u pre-figuring that awaldng
of the aleeping saints, among whom
Jeremiah ahall himself be found, with
now only gladness in his heart, and
praise upon hia tongue?-11 it not u
foreshadowing the resurrection of the
saints that this incident happened to
the prophet which is here recorded?
" Upon this I awaked, and brheld,
and my sleep was sweet unto me."
Yea, as truly u Israel will be re-
stored, reflecting ae In a glan the
coming glory of the Lord, 80 truly
shall the anticipation of all who have
flillen &sleep in Jesus be realized, " I
ahall be aatimed when I a.wa.ke with
thy likeness."
The manifestation, in spiritual life,
of the sons of the living God, upon
Mount Zion, is but the prelude to the
manifestation of the sons of God, of
every age and of every clime, in the
fnlness of resurrection life and glory,
when they shall be given their dwell-
Ing In that well-prepared and long-
looked-for city, whoso B:uilder and
Maker is God.
In Micah, chap. i., ii., Iii., is most
strongly portrayed the injustice that
Inhabited the capitals both of Israel
and of Judah; and the utter want of
holiness upon that which ahould have
been to the Lord a holy mountain,-
and the word has been fnlfilled, ch. i.
6, " Therefore I will make Samaria as
an heap of the field; u plantings of
the vineyard: and I will pour down
the stones thereof into the valley, and
I willdiscover the foundations thereof."
And, as to Zion, it is said, ch. ill. 11,
" The heads thereofjudge for reward;
and the priests thereof teach for hire;
and the prophets thereof divine for
money; yet will they lean upon the
Lord, and aay, Is not the Lord among
naP None evil can oome upon us."
And equally hu the word beeu ful~
filled upon her: " Therefore shall Zion
for your sake be ploughed as a field;
and Jenualem shall become heaps;

and the mountain of the houae aa the
high p1aoea ofthe foreet."
The deaolati.ons of Zion have been
accomplished; and aa truly will be
fulfilled this word, ch. iv., "But in the
1aat days it shall come to pass, the
mountain of the houae of the Lord
shall be established in the top of the
mountains; aud it shall be exalted
above the hills; and people shall flow
unto it." Yea, many nations shall be
joined to the Lord in that day, and
submitting to the law which shall go
forth of Zion, they shall live in peace,
and be given the enjoyment of bleBS-
ing,ver. 2-i. TheyshalltaketheLord
to be their God for ever and ever; and
he shall gather them into oneneu as
his people, and the Lord shall reign
over tb.em in Mount Zion from hence-
forth, even for ever, ver. 6-7. How
very expressive ia the word with re-
gard to Zion and Jerusalem in ver. 8:
"And thou, 0 tower of the flock, the
stronghold of the daughter of Zion,
unto thee shall it come, even the first
dominion; the kingdom shall com,e to
the daughter ofJerusalem."
The Lord had said, ver. 7, that he
would make herthat halted a remnant,
and her that was cast far off, a strong
nation. Judah, the remnant, returned
from Babylon, after the seventyyears'
captivity. After Israel had become
decided on backsliding, and 80 had
been cast far off among the heathen,
Judah still halted between two opi-
nions; but at length, upon the rem-
nant's return from Babylon, there
seemed to be more of a taking the
Lord to be their God. It was, how-
ever, more in profession than in r&-
ality. Zion was still surrounded by
straits; the promised peace was not
yet come.
It ia said, " Now also many nations
aregathered against thee,that say, Let
her be defiled, and let our eye look
upon Zion." Bnt God will overrule
all their strivings and machinations for
the accomplishment of good for those
whose hearts are sincere before him.
" They know not the thoughts of the
Lord, neither understand they his
counsel: for he shall gather them as
the sheaves into the floor." It is not
for nothing that 80 many difFerent n&-
tiona, both in the east and the west,
Mahommedan and professedly Chria-
tian,-80 many opposite parties, all
over the world, have 80 remarkable an
interest in the case of Jerusalem. It
may yet be the occasion of gaining
for Jerusalem peculiar advantages
with regard to all nations, free from
the thraldom of any one earthlypower.
There is the floor which the Lord will
thoroughly purge ; and whereto av&-
nues will be opened up from all the
ends of the earth; that thereuntD the
sheaves may be brought. And it shall
be said " Arise and ~. 0 daughter
of Zion: for I will make thine horn
iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass;
and thou shalt beat in pieces many
people;"-powerfnlly convincingof the
truth multitudes of those who,from all
nations, shall resort to Jerusalem-
separating the wheat from the chaff;
and appropriating eaoh precious grain
to the Lord's peculiar service, for the
dissemination of the word, for the
spreading of the witness among all n&-
tions over the wide world. So it ia
said, " And I will consecrate their
gain unto the Lord; and their aub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole
earth." This is the time when the
strong nation will have been brought
forth of the desolate woman-she that
wss given a bill of divorce, and sent
afar oft:
Now (ch. v. 1-6) ia the invitation
to her who hath been sown over the
earth; who hath been sending forth
her children in colonizing troops into
all the ends of the earth. Hitherto
she hath been spreading herself; but
now it is said unto her, " Now gather
thyself in troops, 0 daughter oftroops."
It is ss the strong nation, to prepara
for the reception of that King who
was previously rejected by the rem-
nant of his brethren, that Israel ia in-
vited to return. Most eamestly were
the Jews forewarned of the evils of·
that siege, which, at the predicted
period, came uron them; and sinoe
which,theyhave80 remained underthe
threatened destruction. And why did

all ibis evil come upon them? Be-
cause they rejected Him who alone
could deliver. The prediction was ac-
complished, " They shall smite the
Judge of Israel with a rod upon the
cheek.• The prophecy goes back to
the birth of Him who was so set at
nought at His death. He was born at
. Bethlehem Ephretah,one of the least
ofthe thousandsofJudah, $8 to popu-
lation. They seem not to have known
its being made the greatest as to pri-
vilege, in giving birth to Him who was
chosen ont of the people, to appear be-
fore <Jbd for us, and who is also ap-
pointed to be " Ruler in Israel."-'-

will be the glorious consummation of
His wondrous dealings with his people,
who had been made not his people;
and then shall it be found that He
who is the Ending was also the Be-
ginning;-to which the prophecy now
goes back, recognising Him who was
bomin Bethlehem,asbeing the Mighty
God, " Whose goings forth have been
from of old, from everlasting." The
Everlasting God, who took to him our
nature, was he who was rejected of the
people, and given over to be smitten
with a rod upon the cheek, in despite
of his pretensions as Ruler in, and
as Judge of Isreel: therefore did he
give them up to their own choice, to
" have no king but Cmsar." He gave
them up "till the time that she which
travai.leth hath brought forth "-the
strong nation, of her that was cast far I
off,-even of the lost house of Israel,
by whom He who was rejected of the
remnant, shall be joyfully accepted as
King; and" then shall these, the rem-
nant of his brethren, return unto
the children of Israel; " see Mic. v.
1--3. He will assemble unto him
the outcasts of Israel, and then will
he gather together the dispersed of
Judah from the four comers of the
earth. Then it is that the Lord, hav-
ing manifested Himself, and having
been acknowledged as the Lord of
Hosts, and not merely of a remnant;
as the God of Israel, and not of the
Jews only: then it is that this speech
will be used in the land of Judah, and
in the cities thereof, when the Lord
will bring again their captivity. " The
Lord bless thee, 0 habitation ofJustice
-mountain of Holiness." "In thee,"
said Jacob to Joseph, "in thee shall
Israel bless, saying, God make thee as
Ephraim and as Manasseh;" and ibis
prediction will be fulfilled when Jeru-
salem shall have these as her children .
after she bad lost the other. These
will have sought, first, the kingdom of
God, and his righteousness; and all
things else, that are neceBSarY, shall,
correspondent to the name of their fa-
ther Joseph (adding), be added unto
them. He will have shewn them the
vanity of all self-righteousness, how-
ever costly in sacrifice; and shewn
them what is good, even his loving-
kindness in the gil\ of his Son; and,
as one man, they shall have been
taught to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with their God,
ch. vi. 6-8. Then shall be the flow-
ing to Jeru..<aleru (vii. 11, 12); and
after the long desolations of the land
which have been,because ofthem that
dwell therein, for the fruit of their
doings,-the permission shall be given
for their peaceable return. The prayer
hath been heard, "Feed thy people
with thy rod, the flock. of thine beri:
tage, which dwell solitarily in the
wood." The sheep that were cast out
into the northern wilderness, He hath
been lending like a flock. ; and at
length this shall be realized, " In the
midst of Carmel let them feed; in
Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of
old." Thenwill it be said,from a heart-
felt sense of the forgiving grace and
abounding goodness of our God," Who
is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
iniquity, and passeth by the transgres-
sion of the remnant of his heritage?
He retaineth not his anger for ever,
because he delighteth in mercy." Yes,
" He will turn again, He will have
compassion upon us; He will subdue
our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all
their sins into the depths of the sea.
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
the mercy to Israel, which thou hast
sworn unto our fatherd from tle days
of old.

RECAPITULA.TION OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS.
Ju. XXXI. 2-26.
LET ua now more briefly rniew, and
• compare together, the voices of these
seven thunders. The first (v. 2-6)
contains the exclamation of the people
left of the sword, who have fbund
grace in the wilderness. All the fa-
milies of Israel had been cast afar off';
whilst the Jews were &till left near,
and had the gospel first declared unto
them; but it waa especially desfgned
for the 11 lost sheep of the house of
Israel;" and by this people there is
the recognition of his wondrous love,
11 The Lord hath appeared from afar
unto me;" and the Lord answers by
calling our attention to his working
with us from the beginning, 11 Yea., I
have loved thee with an everlasting
love; therefore have I extended lo'l'ing-
kindneas to thee." Thus much with
regard to past and present kindness
whilat yet ont of the land; and next,
with regard to their condition in re-
atoration, " Again I will build thee,
and thou shalt be built, 0 virgin of
Israel; thou shalt again be adorned
with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in
the dances of them that make merry.
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the
mountains of SamariA;'' a prediction
which clearly belonged not to the
Jews, and which remains to be ful-
fllled to Israel.-And in theit restora-
tion there ahall neither be indolence,
IICR.!'<:,it~1norniggardliness," Theplant-
en sii!W plant, and Bball make them
common.' -And, possessing Samaria,
they shall have Zion as the throne of
the kingdom. This ia most plainly
distinguished from any state of things
which has been llince the words were
spoken: " For there shall be a day
the watchmen ttpon Mount Ephraim
Bball cry, Arise le, and let us go up
to Zion unto the ordour God." Soon
indeed may this joyful call be made
upon the mountains of Israel.
In Isaiah the case of Israel, who
was put away, as contrasted with Ju-
dah who was left under the marri&gQ
covenant of the law, ia very largely
dwelt upon. That prophet who so
dwells upon the salvation of Israel,
gives an enlargement upon the 11bject
of this first thunder. ·
The second thunder (v. 7, 8) re-
cognl.ses more particularly thelocality
from which the people are to proceed,
whose restoration to the land, and
b.Ssembling on Zion, are so mani-
festly predicted.-They are 11 people
who have occasion to 11 sing withglad-
ness," Their shout is to be raised
among" the chief of the nations."-
They are neither to be found a desti-
tute nor a despised people: neither
illiterate nor without the knowledge
of the true worship of God: neither
are they ignorant of, nor wi~hout
bowels of compassion for, the Jews:
and,· accordingly, as having unprece-
dented means of obeying the com-
mand, the words to them are, 11 Pub-
lish yeI praise ye! and eay, 0 LordI
111ve thy people the remnant of Is-
rael." And the Lord answers with a
still farther indication ofplace, and of
suchremarkable means of conveyance
as have been provided for our people
in these last days; 11 Behold, I will
bring them from the north country;
and gather them from the coasts of
the earth; with them the blind and
the lame, the woman with ohild, and
herthat travaileth withohildtogether;
a great company shall return thither.
They shall come with weeping, and
with favours will I lead them. I will
cause them to walk by the rivers of
waters, in a straight way wherein they
shall not stuinble."-Thns is Judahto
be received into blessing, 11 For I am a
Father unto Israel, and Ephraim Ia
my first born." The birthright ia his;

and now it will have eome to him, and
he ii to uat it, in obeyina tho oall, to
aroute hia brethren: he having pro-
plll'edthemeana of tholr speedy retllrn,
to a full particip&Uon with him, of
thobJ.euing to be found in hit F•ther'a
houae.
The auqjeot of thii seoond thunder,
tho quarter in which lsroel. was more
particularly to be found, ia, as we
have eoen, pointed out in Jeremiah.
The third thunder (9-14) pro-
ceeda more particularly to identity the
people who have thua 1\lready been so
pointed out, aa to time and place. The
word ofthe Lord, as being propheaied
overtho dry bones, was to be the great
meana of forming Israel anew, Ezek.
:uxvii., preparing them for tho mani-
festation oftheir proper life as sona of
the living God.-The word was to
find them nations, or Gentiles; and
specially waa the word to reach them
in the ialea afar off. " Hoar the word
of the Lord, 0 ye nations; and do-
clare it in the isles afar off; and aay,
He that aoatterod Iarael will pther
him, and keep him aa a ahepherd doth
his flock." We, in theae isles afar off,
unto whom the word of the Lord hath
so oome1 are certainly intereated in
thia oall•.....;we are oalled to believe
that God hath purposed to identiJY hia
people,-tho very people who were
IKlattered.-He will gather them, and
keep them, so that they need not fear
to put themeelves under his leadership.
They are to be found a redeemed
people.- It is beoauae they are al-
readyaredeemedand ransomed people,
that" theyshallcome andflow together
to the goodneu of the Lord;" to the
rich and abundant spiritual hi081ing
that he will bestow upon them, in
their collective oapeoity. They were
once his aoattered, but aro now his re-
deemed and raneomed people. But
although it is aplritual blessing in
which they ehall fllioice, temporal
good ahall nos be denied. " And their
eoul ahall be aa a watored sarden1and
they ahall not sorrow any more at
all." And there follows, ae we have
Men, such a oloar identification of aex
and ljj9, and other relative condition,
61 plainly impliea that the identifio&-
tion is to take plaee in the preaent liftl.
And we have hoard, that it is to be
deolared to, and realized in, a people
oalled Gentiles or nations, dwellinc
where we are, in the iales or maritime
partaofthe north country, which were
as a wildemesa when our fathers oame
hither. The manifestation is eapo-
cially to take plaee inthe land. There
it is that the Lord will fulfil hia word.
"And my people ahall be aatiafied with
my goodnesa, aaith tho Lord." See
Ezekiel for the more full expression of
this thunder.
The prophecy, having thus clearly
indicated the time of Israel's reatora-
tion,-tbat it is af\er their having
found grace in the wildem011; and
aliO the plaee where they are to be
found, that it is among the chief of
the nations, where there are meana
and freedom ofpnbliahing, where there
is occaaion for praise,and where prayer
is made for the Jews, tho remnant of
Iarael; and having also indicated the
means and certainty of larael'a identi-
fication,- it now prooeeda, in the
fourth thunder (v. 15-17), to point
out the Onenesa of Christ with the
children of Rachel. It ie as being
found in Him, that theae are to be
found sons of the living God.-Ho
took npon Him their sorrowa, that his
blessing might deaoend upon them.-
Ephraim seemed to be cut off by the
eword of the Assyrian ; as Jesus
seemed to be by that of Herod, in the
alaughter of the children of Bethle-
hem. " A voice was heard in Ramah,
lamentation, bitter weeping, Rachel,
weeping for her children, refuted to
be comforted for herchildren, beoanae
they were not." Bnt as the promised
One Seed was preaerved until the
finishing of hie work, so was Ephraim
to be preaerved until the finishing of
the work appointed him to perform in
Cbriet ; as being brought into one-
ness with Christ, and made members
of his body. It is as being found in
Him, that the children of Rachal are
thne spoken of by the Lord, as apos-
trophiaing their weeping mother, "Re-
frain thy voice from weeping, and

108 All DB8CJUBBD1 JBBBKIAR XXXI. 2-26.
thine eyes from tears; for thy work
shall be rewarded, Bllith the Lord; and
they shall come again from the land
of the enemy." And not only shall
their redemption from the power of
death take place, by the triumph of
Jeans through the cross-Previous to
the resurrection, and immediately be-.
fore it, " There is hope in thine end,
Bllith the Lord, thatthy children shall
come again to their own border."-
We have seen that, in the Book of
Psalms, there is a remarkable recog-
nition of the oneness of Christ with
his people, who were lost, but who are
to be found in Him.
Having thus a.ssured of the identi-
fication in Christ, and restoration
through him, of that which was lost,
the fifth thunder (v. 18-20) proceeds
to the recognition of Ephraim, who
was entirely lost ; but yet is to be
found as having been dealt with as
was promised to the first-hom. He
is being prepared for blessing. 'l'he
}'ather recognises the voice of his re-
turning prodigal, "I have surely heard
Ephraim bemoaning himself." Thus
is he to be found expressing himselfat
the time of his recognition, and pre-
vious to his restoration, " Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised as a
bullock untaught. Tum thou me,
and I shall be turned; for thou art the
Lord my God. Surely after that I
was turned I repented, and after that
I was instructed, I smote upon my
thigh. I was ashamed ; yea, even
confounded; because I did bear the
reproach of my youth." Ephraim be-
ing thus brovght to a sense of his ut-
ter helplessness in himself; and entire
dependence upon his Father's good-
ness, wisdom, and power, the Father
exclaims, as in full recognition of him
whose return, as well as previous
backsliding, we find so pointedly de-
scribed in Hosea:-" Ephraim I my
dear sonI a pleasaint child, for since I
spake against him, I do earnestly re-
member him still: therefore my bow-
els are troubled for him; I will surely
have mercy upon him, saith the Lord."
The subject of this thunder is illus-
trated in Hosea. We have in the
fifth thunder the Recognition of Eph-
raim, correspondent to the promise of
Identification, as given in the third.
Ephraim, being recognised as the
first-hom, it is not that he may boast
himself of either a vain or an oppres-
sive pre-eminence; but that he should,
like his Leader, be the servant of all;
and prepare for the reception of all his
brethren into an equal participation
with him of the blessing his Father is
pleased to bestow. And accordingly,
the sixth thunder (v. 21, 22) proceeds
to invite to the adoption of means for
the return of Israel generally; and
there is a remonstrance with Israel
for her dilatoriness in making use
of the means provided: indica.ting that
the Lord would have this work per-
formed with speed, immediately upon
Israel's knowing herself to be the
people addressed. The very sound of
the langnsge, and abrupt charaoter of
the sentences, is expressive of speed.
"Set thee up waymarks; make thee
high heaps; set thine heart toward the
highway, the way thou wenteat: tum
again, 0 virgin of Israel; tum again
to these thy cities. How long wilt
thou go about, 0 thou backsliding
daughter? For the Lord hath created
a new thing in the earth, a woman
shall compass a man." Listening to
this call, Israel shall at length sur-
round Ephraim in the enjoyment of
the blessing of which he is first cheer-
fully to partake in the restoration. So
remarkably is this the case, that in
the latter part of Zechariah, who
enlarges upon the subject of this
sixth thunder, Ephraim and the tribes
of Israel, his companions, are spoken
of under the name of Jerusalem, as
distinguished f1'0m Judah; and for
whom they are found in most earnest
supplication before God. SeeZech.xii.
It may be observed that, as in the
second of these thunders, there was
the promise of a way, by which to re-
turn : so in this, the sixth, and corre-
sponding one, there ia a call to the
speedy use of means, as preparing, to
return to Immanuel's land.
The seventh thunder, v. 28-26,
speaks of the answer to the earnest
Digitized byGoogle
prayers, and disinterested labours of
Ephraim, in his being given to see,
not only the asaembliug of the out-
cast& of Israel, which was the suqjeot
of the sixth thunder, but also the
gathering of the dispersed of Judah.
When the Lord will have manifested
himselfas the Lord of Hosts, the God
of Israel, Judah, who has been so long
given up, will be granted a return;
but it will be unto the children of Is-
rael, who shall have previously boon
restored. Then sball the words be ful-
filled, "As yet they shall use this
speeoh in the land of Judah, and in
the cities thereof, when I shall bring
again their captivity. Tho Lord bless
thee, 0 habitation of justice andmoun-
tain ofholiuessl" And not only sball
Israel be blessed iu Jerusalem, but
"There shall dwell in Judah itself,
and in all the cities thereof together,
husbandmen, and they go forth with
the flock; for I have satiated the
weary soul, and I have replenished
everysorrowful soul." And then when
Israel, the time of whose restoration
wa.s intimated in the first thunder, and
Judah, whose subsequent restoration
is descnl>ed in this seventh thunder-
when those who were far off, Rlld
those who were nigh, are made one in
Him, whose oneness with his people
is fully implied in the fourth, the cen-
tre of these seven, then shall the Lord
return unto his people, who sball have
returned unto Him: and they which
are alive unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent those that are asleep:
-that sball be which wa.s represented
in the case of the prophet, "Upon this
I awaked, and beheld, and my sleep
was sweet unto me."
The voices of the seven thunders
seem to be these: There is, first, from
109
the uttermost partsof the earth, beard
the song, the grateful acknowledg-
ment, " The Lord hath appeared from
afar unto me." With thundering plau-
dits the call shall be obeyed, " Sing
with gladnesa for Jacob, and shout
among the chief of the nations." The
word shall be believed, "He that
seattered Israel will gather him; and
keep • him as a shepherd doth his
flock." And, resting upon the finished
work of our blessed Redeemer, it is
said in the fourth, " They shall come
again from the land of the enemy."
In the fifth, Ephraim, with fulness of
heart embraces new covenant mercy,
"Turn thou me, nnd I shall be turned;
for thou art the Lord my God." This
is immediately followed with the joy-
ful invitation for all the tribes of Is-
rael to return, " Turn again, 0
Virgin of Israel, turn again to these
thy cities." ·And even Judah at
length listens to the invitation, and
is heard to exclaim, " The Lord bless
thee, 0 habitation of justice, moun-
tain of holinessI "
As we desire the rending of the vail,
and manifestation of the glory of the
Lord: as we desire the redemption of
Israel, and the restoration of Judah to
the favour of God; as we desire the
universal heralding of the kingdom,
the coming of the King, and the re-
surrection of the sainte, and our being
united,in fnlness ofblessing, and in the
everlasting kingdom, let ns desire a
sincereandf!&rllest preparation ofheart
and life, of the Lord's first-hem, for
his returning with joyfulness to the
Land which the Lord hath chosen to
place his name there. There the people
saved from their sins are to manifest
Christ, in the power of that anointing
which is spoken of in His Name.

As the Wonderful, the God of Pro-
vidence, He watched over " to pluck
up " his people, even the whole house
of Israel, that He planted in the good
land He had promised to theirfathers.
It was with a mighty hand that He
brought them out of Egypt, and cast
out the nations before them, and gave
them to inherit a land flowing with
milk and honey. But they forgat the
hand that fed them, and milnsed the
favours he beetowed ·upon them: so
He plucked them up, and cast them
far off among the Gentiles, and dis-
persed them throughout the countries;
and they were to appearance lost to
that land, and even to themeelves;
and so have they remained until the
end of the seven times, during which
Israel was to be outcast from the land,
and Judah in painful subjection to the
Gentilea.
As the Counsellor, the God of Re-
demption, also, He hath been watch-
ing over them" to break down." He
hath broken down the middle wall of
partition that stood between those that
were cast afar off among the Gentiles,
and these,theJews,that were let\ near.
The ordinances which were com-
manded to be observed, according to
the covenant which was made with
their fathers when they came up out
ofEgypt, have been removed. There
has, for about eighteen centuries, been
.no opportunity of fnlly attending to
them, even by those who were the
most inclined to trust in them.-Hav-
ing rejected Him who is the fulfilling
of the law, the end of the law for
righteousness to every one that be-
lieveth, the Jews have, in the provi-
dence of God, been deprived of all
national ground of trusting in their
own righteousness, aooording to the
law. May they 100n &ee for what pur-
pose it is that they have been th1111
dealt with; and know the kindness of
our God, in breaking down that wall
which they would have made a wall
of separation, not only between them-
selves and the Gentiles, but between
Moses's disciples and the Redeemer of
Israel.
As the Mighty God, the God of
Creation, also, He hath been watching
over them "to throw down" the ima-
ges, the work of men's hands, which
not onlyby ancient Israel were set up,
but by their modern deacendants,
called Christians. Along with their
idols, how utterly cast down, have be-
come those idolaters, professing Chris-
tianity, in the very land of Israel it-
self! They also have been cut off, or
are trampled under foot, by the proud
Mahommedan oppressor; who was
given a commission,not only to throw
down the idols of the heathen, but to
pour contempt upon the shame of
those who profe111 to have salvation
through the cro88 of our Lord Jeena
Christ ; but whose trust is not in
" the Mighty God" who made heaven
and earth; but in a god which them-
selves have made--a wheaten god-a
wafer-the work of men's hands,-be-
fore which they bow, and upon which
they call for deliverance: which, in
the mass,is said bythe Romaniststo be
offered up for them in sacrifice-a sa-
crifice for the sins of both the living
and the deadI After which, this god
is swallowed by them as is a morsel
of bread. This deep degradation hath
not only been the castiug down of no-
minal Christians in the land, but of
manynationsontofit. Againandagain
hath the MightyGod visited this insult
to his divine m!PJesty,withthethrowing
down of our own nation, even as He
hath honoured our open protest against
all such abominations, by exaltiug us,
since that protest, above all the na-
tions of the earth. May God forbid
that our fall should be with Babylon!

utterly abolish. May our experience

He who promised to be as a Father
to Israel, hath yet been watchingover
them, as if" to destroy " even his first-
born Ephraim, and make all the me-
mory of him and his oompanions to
perish. They were carried away into
a land of forgetfulness. They have
been sought for, and oould not be
found; or ifit was thought they were
found, as in the North American In-
dians, or the Nestorians, it was as
perishing from off the face ofthe earth
-as being manifestly in a state of de-
struction. The hope of finding the
lost children of Rachel, the fatherless,
who were to find mercy in the ever-
lasting arms, hath ever, as it was ap-
proached, fled from the grasp of the
anxious inquirer : or, if it could sa-
tisfy the individual discoverer, it could
satisfy but few beside. The Jews
were known, but evidently under se-
vere rebuke; and as perishing, both in
the land and among the Gentiles, in
much misery, and generally in deep
disgrace, with, seemingly, no smile of
their Heavenly Father shining upon
their weary way. The people bearing
the name of Israel have not known
the love of Him who said, " I am a
Father to Israel;" and the people of
whom the everlasting Father saith,
" Ephraim is my first-born" have been
called "the LostI"
The Prince of Peace, the King of
Salem, hath also aeemed to be, as the
God of Providence, watching over
only " to affiict," and that the very
capital of his expected kingdom.-
Truly Zion hath been affiicted and
smitten evermore.-Of all cities, it
hath,perhaps, the least seen thatwhich
is expressed in the name Salem,
Peace. What afBiction from without,
and mutual destruction from within,
were there at the time of its being
'beSieged by the RomansI And then
-again how entire WILB its destruc-
tion by the Persians! The Christians,
as they were called, had only time
after that destruction to prepare it as
a prize for the Saracens; and then
came the Crusaders, establishing their
h
kingdom of Jerusalem: since which
it has once and again been lost and
won by the kings of the south and the
north; and now the place appointed
to be the throne of the Lord, is still
in a position the most critical. The
oppressor is the judge-the hand to
defend, is that which wonld spoil her.
Her inhabitants are of too heterogene-
ous a character to give any great pro-
mise of internal prosperity or peace;
and there is aa little of it from with-
out. Plunder, oppression, and strife,
have been faat desolating the land,
and wearing out the inhabitants.
Thus did the Lord pluck up the
whole house of Israel, break down the
Jewish economy, and cast down the
idols. Thus hath the name of Eph-
raim perished among the heathen, out
among whom they were cast ; and
thus haa the place of the name of the
Lord of hosts been of all places the
most affiicted evermore. But is it to
oontinue so always? No. The mys-
tery of all this wondrous working is to
be disclosed. It is to be seenthat the
plucking up of lsrs.e1 was, that, being
planted in other lands, their seed be-
ing in many waters, they might spread
out unto all the ends of the earth, and
fill the face of the world with fruit.-
The breaking down of the Jews, and
depriving them of the means of ob-
serving that ceremonial law, in which
even the disciples of Christ were too
disposed to trust, and the dispersing
them among their brethren who had
been cast afar off, was that He might
make of the twa.in one new man, so
making peace. The throwing down
of the idols, and therewith of idola-
trous Christian confederacies,whether
in the east or the west, has been that
Israel might exalt their King, the God
of heaven and earth; and might, with
Him, be exalted-Searching into His
works, in place of worshipping their
own, they were to acquire power for
the production ofworkaofusefulness:
" He hath shewed His people the
power of his works, that he may give
them the heritage of the Ma.then."

raim to perish, the depriving them of

awl plaoe, the place of the name of
the Lord of hosts, the Mount Zion.
God hath indeed wrought won-
~uly in accomplishing the threat-
uedjudgments; and this he gives as
a pledge that the promises will be ful-
filled with eqaal verity and fulness of
aooomplishmeut ; so that, however
wondroua the things may be which
He hath promised to do for his people
in their latter end, we need not doubt
-of their literal fulfilment. In that
land whioh hath been 10 long lying
wute, tJi'epromise ahall be fOIIlld good
to the peeple that were &Up,poaed to be
loet, Joel ii. 26. " And ye aha1l
.eat in plenty, aad ·be satisfied, and
·,praile the name of the Lord your
God, that hath dealt wondrously with
yon; and my people aha1l never be
uhamed." Yea, and better than all,
the fnlness of the bleuing shall be
poured upoa the whole body of the
people, as truly as on the few disciples
upon whom the Spirit descended on
the daf of Pentecost. Many dark
aaya have come ainoe; but all these
were fcnknown IIDd furetold. The
llelo!Mions &1111 accompliahed : ·this
cannot be deDied. Aa undeniably
mut the promise -.nd eure, " So will
I watch over you to build and to
plmt, eaith the Lord."
Then the ain or Backsliding Is-
rael, in aeeking to be like the nations
around them, will no longer be visited
upon their posterity, as being lei\ un-
distinguished among the nations: but
" All that aee them aha1l acknowledge
them that they are the seed the Lord
hath bleaaedI " The ain of tres-
cheroua Judah, in denying their King,
ao.d through that denial courting the
favour of a heathen monarch, will uo
longer be visited upon their children,
bytheir being dealt with treacherously
by all the heathen powers, among
whom they have been wandering
in judicial blindness. Israel shall be
acknowledged of the Lord, and Judah
shall acknowledge their King: and
this shall be in Zion. " He will in
thia mountain destroy the face of the
covering cast over all people, and the
vail that is apread over all nations.-
He will swallow up death in victory;
and the Lord Goi will wipe &'WILy
tears from oft' all faoea; and the re-
buke of his people shall he take a'W!Ly
from oft' all the earth; for the Lord
'hath spoken." So ahall it come to
pass that, " In those daya they shall
say no more, the fathers have eaten a
sour grape, and the cluldren's teeth
are set on edge." But still there shall
be no cauae for presumptuous rebel-
lion against the divine government:
-The individual &inner aha1l be
punished, although his posterity shall
escape. Sin shall be immediately
punished in t.be person of the guilty,
so that it will not contaminate the na-
tion, nor be propagated from sire to
eon, as before-" But every·one shall
die for his own iniquity." So will He
purge out the ·ainners from among
them. " Every man that eateth the
·SOur grape, his teeth aha1l be set OJl
edge." AB truly as the Providence
I

to the word in the former dispensa-

the mountains of Israel; ofwhich they
are to be given poaseuion, according
to the terms of this new covell&llt.
By this also their national councils
are to be regulated, equally with their
private and personal concerns. And
as to the Jews, they have generally
looked to the old national covell&llt,
which they have not kept, and do not
keep, and according to which they can
never regain posseiBion. The an-
nouncement of a N ev1 COMIIIIII is, in-
deed, worthyofnote, first bythe Jew,
that he may be made to look for that
which is presented in the gospel.-Its
newness is to be remarked by also the
outcasts of Israel: for it is not new as
to individual salvation. In this re-
spect it is older than the former na-
tional covell&llt made with Israel ;
inasmuch as it is the same which
had been hundreds of years before,
declared unto Abraham : who was
justified by faith, tis were all the chil-
dren of God both before and since.
They were, and are, all individually
B!LVed according to the terms of the
new covenant. As to individual sal-
vation,ittherefore, is not new, in con-
trast to the covell&llt made with Israel
at Mount Sinai; but it is new as a
national covenant--as a covenant ac-
cording to which Israel and Judah are
to be received into the land, and be
accepted by Him there as his nation,
they taking the Lord himself as their
King-the King whom all Israel re-
jected in the days of Samuel,, four
hundred and ninety years before their
being outcast; and whom Judah pro-
cured to be crucified forty years before
their dispersion. This King Eternal,
theJewswillacknowledge as theKing
Immortal-and they will earnestly cry
for the return of our risen Lord-And
this Kingimmortal,Israel willjoyfnlly
submit to as their Ruler, while He is
yet invisible: whom having not seen
they love-in whom, though now they
see Him not, yet believing, they re-
joice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory. Both Israel and Judah, re-
penting at length of their folly and
wicltedness, shall submit unto Him
as the only wise God; and seek to
be saved by His grace, and directed
by His truth.
There is a clear distinction drawn
between this covenant and the former
national one. The contrast is drawn
by the Lord Himself. This is " Not
according to the covell&llt that I
made with their fathers in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring
them out ofthe land of Egypt; which
my covenant they brake: Should I
have continued an husband unto them,
aaith the Lord?" Hehadespouaedis-
rael untoHimself, engaging, upon their
submitting to Him as their Guardian
and Governor, to be their God-to
lead them into the land of promise,
and protect them in the possession
thereof. In token of their subjection
to Him, certain services, as those of
the ceremonial law, were to be per-
formed by them. These they ne-
glected; and they lightly esteemed the
Rock of their salvation; - and at
length the great body of the people
sought to be relieved from what they
esteemed to be a yoke too grievous to
be borne; and the Lord gave them
their request.-He gave Israel a bill of
divorce, and sent her away. She
cannot be married to Him again ac-
cording to that covenant; neitherdoes
He propose that she should. " But
this shall be the covenant that I will
make with the house of Israel : after
those days, aaith the Lord."-After
the days of separation, during which
both the contracting parties would
have died, that so they might lawfully
be united in the newness of life. He
took to Him a human body, fulfilled
for her the law which she had broken;
died for his people's sins, and rose
again for their justification. She hath
passed through a national death dur-
ing the predicted seven times, or until
the third day ofa thousand years; and
He promised that on the third day He
would raise us up, and we should live
in his sight,- be brought back to
dwell before him in His ownland,-in
a land which is to be emphatically the
land of the living; and upon which
will be the eyes of the Lord from the
beginning of the year unto the end of

it.. Israel will be brought forth as
from their graves. Their aeattered
dust will be collected into onene88.
As, in spirit, risen with Christ, they
will set their affections upon things
above; and will look, and likewisepre-
pare for that life of immortality, in
which the con8UIIllDBtion of the mar-
riage is to take place. But there is a
time of preparation. He hath pur-
poled to present it to Himself a glo-
rious church, not having spot or
wrinkle orany such thing; but that it 1
should be holyand without blemish.-
He wants not only to have individuals
prepared, but his whole nation.
And this is the preparetion : " I
will put my law in their inward parts:"
and not merely in the ark of the cove-
nant, in the inner temple as before;
and now He will write it in their hearts,
and not only upon tables of stone.
We shall know the love that God hath
manifested as the Redeemer of Israel,
as redeeming ue with his own blood,
that He might accomplish his counsel
of peace; and we shalllove Him who
first loved ue. Thoroughly con-
vinced of the folly of withstandingHis
will, and fully convinced that his will
towards us is good, we shall render
ourselves up wholly into his hands,
that He maygive us an understanding
of all that He would have us to do,
and also give us the ability to do it.-
We should diligently inquire as to
what the will ofthe Lord is; and what
He reveals unto us of his mind, let us
not merely, as heretofore, have as a
book in our hands, or only as words
in our mouths, upon which we seek to
put the impression of our own minds:
Let us have the mind of Christ: then
we shall have that spirit that search-
eth all things; yea, the deep things
of God. We shall not esteem our-
selvesto be wiser than He is, but sub-
mit to be taught of God: and what we
are taught will be deposited in our
inmost affections-and it will direct
our thoughts, and regulate our lives.
And that which shall rule will be the
royal law-the law of liberty-the
law of love. An enlightened desire to
act for the glory of Him who hath re-
deemed us, and for the good of all we
have the power of benefiting, and
especially for the edification of the
household of faith. We shall look
unto Jesus who loved us unto the
death; we shall look unto Christ as
exalted to the Father's right hand, and
long for a full conformity to Him, and
a union in glory with Him. We shall
earnestly prepare for his coming, to
receive us into the place He hath gone
to prepare for us.-So shall the place
of his feet-yea, of his throne-yea,
of where he will dwell in the midst of
the children of Israel, be prepared. In
the prospect of reigning with Him in
heaven, we shall not deny Him his
sovereignty upon earth.
God by his graee will accomplish all
this-and He will powerfully work for
those in whom He thus works. He
will direct, uphold, defend, and keep:
so that although the wicked may
gnash with his teeth at all the pros-
perity the Lord will procure for his
people, he shall not be able to prevent
it.-God will overrule all for the good
of his people, so that even the fire of
their enemies will but consume the
obstacles out of the way of the heralds
of the kingdom. And these, seeing
the power of their God so manifestly
put forth in vindication of the truth,
and in defence of righteousness, will
the more entirely devote themselves
to the will of their King. When our
God hath in the Holy Land, a holy
peopl&-a people. whom, consistently
with his holiness, He can defend, He
will not be backward to put forth his
arm of power-as in the days of old,
when He made the former nationlll
covenant with Israel-Yea,his coun10l
shall stand-the word shall be ac-
complished, " I will be their God, and
they shall be my people." They were
made, Lo-ammi, " not my people," as
having the former national covenant
dissolved; but again they are taken
into national covenant with Him.-

Ir seems to have been 811pposed by
many, that, although In the case of
Israel remaining to this day, and be-
ing fonnd within hearing ofthe gospel,
God would have fulfilled his promise,
of receivini them into the enJoyment
of New Testament privileges; yet,
they having ceased to be a nation,
having utterly passed away from the
face of the earth, he has been obliged
to take another people in their stead,
upon whom to bestow the blessings of
his first-born. The Jews !Mlem to
have been tbe first iB this folly,-
taking to themaelvea Ule name, and
claiming the pri'rilege& of Israel, as if
they were the only representatives of
All Israel, unto whom the promises
were made. And others, calling them-
selves Gentiles, have since excluded
even the remnant of Israel: sup-
posing the blessing to have entirely
passed awayfrom the natural branches.
Both Jew and Gentile appear to have
been ignorant of the mystery; and
have become wise in their own con-
ceits. They seem to have fbrgotten
that the Mighty God who upholds
creation, who directs alike the regular
movements of the heavenly bodies,
and controls the tumultuary heavings
of the deep, is the aame God who hath

ing to His bidding; and the sun which
is 80 bright an image of his own divine
power, enlightening and vivifying the
inhabitants of earth, rising from the
east, and proceeding in the direction
in which hath proceeded his own life-
giving word, is iteelf given as a sign
to his people that their case is not hid
from Him; nor is his power put forth
irrespective of them. They are the
very people in relation to whom his
light hath gone forth, and his power is
exerted. They are the very people
who have encircled the globe from the
east, and whose part it is widely to
diffuse his light, with all the power He
hath given them, among the nations
who have long sat in darkn888. And
now they are called to contemplate
the element upon which they have
been thus far borne, 80 as to encircle
every shore; and, whilst they see in
it pictured forth the apparently un-
manageable tumnltsof the people,they
are to think of Him whose path is in
the mighty waters;-" Who divideth
the sea when the waves thereof roar.
The Lord of Hosts is his name." He
doeth according to his will in the ar-
mies of heaven, and among the inha-
bitants of the earth; and none can
stay his hand from working, nor say
unto him, Whatdoest thou? It is He
who saith to the sea in its utmost
fury, Hitherto ehalt thou come, and
no farther; and here shall thy proud
waves be stayed. How striking are
the words of this Mighty God, and
how well calculated to put to silence
the snrmisings of unbelief, as to the
possibility of his failing to overrule
all for the acc!omplishment of his pur-
poses with regard to Israel : " Ifthose
ordinances depart from before me,
saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel
al80 shall cease from being a nation
before me for ·ever.'' They might
cease to exist in man's esteem. Amidst
the confused oonfiictings of nations,
they might to appearance be cast
away, or be lost to the view of man;
bat to the eye of Omniscience they
wonld ever be present; by the hand
of Omnipotence they wonld ever be
upheld. AB through the Red Sea, a
path was clef\ for their fathers, so fer
them, we may rest assured, wonld a
way be made, 80 that they mighL be
preserved and conducted into the en-
joyment of all that is promised. The
laws of Providence, as constant and
sure as the laws of creation, wonld be
ever tending towards this; and un-
doubtedly this has been the case with
regard to the people we identify with
Israel. The very changes which have
been for the wasting of other nations,
have been for their improvement and
elevation.

working of the Mighty God, the God

may gainsay-

"Thus saith the Lord,
If heaven above can be measured,
And the foundations of the earth ~~earched out beneath,
I will also cast off all the seed of Israel,
For all that they have 1lone, oaith the Lord."'
THE fatherly compassion of the God
of l81'8el is as everlasting as his wis-
domis infinit11,and his poweralmighty.
Many, and, it is supposed, successful,
attempts, have been made to measure
the distances of sun, moon, and stars
from each other, and from the earth;
but the heaven itself who can mea-
sure? Even the heavenly city can
be measured; and the God of Israel
hath condescended to speak to them
ofthe ample dimensions of that glori-
ous abode: upon tho gates of which
are inscribed the names of the twelve
tribes of Israel, from whom the glori-
fied church will be found to be chiefly
formed; and whatever the distance of
that cityfrom the earth,we know that
it will, at the appointed time, descend
out of heaven from God, and be 80
near as that the nations of the saved
may walk in the light of it; wln1st
those who shall be kings and priests
unto God, will inhabit, in immortal
and glorified bodies, the many man-
sions of that house which is from hea-
ven. Does man say this is impossi-
ble? Hath he measured the heavens,
and traversed, unto its utmost bound-
ary, the creation, 80 as to see and
know that the Father of Israel cannot
give that which eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard, and which it hath not en-
tered into the heart of man toconceive
~even the inheritance, incorruptible
and undefiled, and that fadeth not
away? Therich reward which is with
Him; and with which He will meet
those that go forth to meet Him-
which He hath prepared for him that
waiteth for Him? Do we not see tho
immeasurable condescension of the
love of God already manifested in tho
gift of his Son, into our world, even
when 80 unprepared to meet him, to
welcome him as the promised Deli-
verer? And ifHe hathalready cometo
earn in our very nature that glorious
reward for the people as being given
the divino nature, can we doubt that
His goodness will bestow it? MBy we
not say even the justice of God will
reach to the procuring for his re-
deemed that whichhath been 80 dearly
purchased for them? AB truly as
this immeasurable mercy",is promised,
it is promised to the outcast house of
l81'8el. Tho boundless love of God
in the gift of his Son, while presented
to mankind generally, was especially
designed for IsraeL This was the
expressed design of God; and we are
not to think that the hand which
plucked them up, and cast them forth
ofthe land, cast them 80 far away, as
that the goodness designed for them
could not reach them.

God of IsraeL An insular poaition
was the best fitted ·for protection
againstimmediate assault,or the need-
lese interferenceofneighbouringstates;
and for the giving them the advant-
ages of the deep that concheth be-
neath. It was also ofimporta.nce that
they should be placed so as to receive
whatever advantages were to be de-
rived from the old world, whila' they
ca.n also afford the most convenient
depot for the productions ofthe new.-
Their position leads them to an ac-
quainta.ncewiththe south; and equa.lly,
a sympathy with the inhabita.nts ofthe
north. The Baltic and Mediterranean
were eqna.lly accessible, upon which
they might try their youthful power
of navigating. But now they have
lannched forth into the wide ocea.n on
a.ll aides; and that not as the sport of
the winds, as of old, but with a direct
conrae, and with wonderful preeision
as to time. In order to possess thia
power to the fullest extent, it waa
needful that we should not only ~
sese the chief things of the a.nc1ent
monntains (such as the oaks of Ba.-
aha.n), but that we alao should have
at hand the chief things of the
lasting hills-the rich, because most
nseful, mineral treasures, with which
our God hath stored thia isla.nd-
the place prepared for the people,
that he intended should act so inl-
porta.nt a .part in the affairs of
the world-east, west, north, and
south-at the time these minerals
should be so remarkably in requisi-
tion ; and without which Eugland
could not fullil her mission. The
iron was necessary to the formation
of railway11, and especia.lly for the pro-
duction of machinery; and abnnd-
ance of coal, for the putting that ma-
chinery in motion; and for availing
ourselve11, to the fullest extent, of
steam power, both for production, as
in our manufactures, and for ~a­
misaion by la.nd or by water. And
with these we required to have an in-
telligent and industrious population,
capable of making use of these mate-
rials to the fullest extent:-And also
having the greatest occasion to use
them on acconnt of widely-extended
connections with other parts of the
globe, by oommeroe or colonization.-
The island we inhabit,would, to many
another people, have been a magazine
of mineral treasures in vain. Neither
the people, the place, nor the occasion,
was the production of chance ; but
each is fitted to the other, according to
the arrangement of eternal and infi-
nite wisdom. Truly that word hath
been verified with regard to the people
who were supposed to be lost in the
depths of the sea, Ps. c.uxix 9, 10-
" If I take the wings of the morning,
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
sea., even there sha.ll thy hand lead
me, and thy right hand aha.ll hold
me.''
When the Lord laid the fonn~
tions of the earth, he had in view the
people who were to dwell upon it.-
And when the Most High divided to
the nations their inherita.nce, when he
separated the sons of Adam, he set
the bonnds of the people according to
the number of the children of Israel
When He was casting them out ofthe
Land, He was no lese leading them, to
make to himself a. glorious name, than
when He was leading their fathers out
of Egypt. He was bringing the out-
cast woman into the wilderness, that
he might bring her into the place
which had been prepared for her, and
where her Lord might lead her forth;
as setting his right foot upon the sea.,
and his left upon the earth. And,
having given her those wonderful faci-
lities for traversing both, which he
bath given, we cannot doubt but at
length he will aocomplish to her his
promise of bringing her seed from the
east, and gathering her from the west,
with a.ll that vast accumulation of
means, whereby, as having received
the promised anointing from on high,
the chosen people are appointed to
herald his second and gloriousadvent,
nnto every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and Dation. ,

becoming appa.rent for what they ha'Pe
been there placed, yet they have not
been, nor can they be, ~ed ont.
How strong is the assnra.nce of Jeho-
vahI How plain the wordI and yet
how ignorant, orhow unbelieving, man
has been with regard to it! " Thus
saith the Lord, Ifheaven above can be
measnred, or the foundations of the
earth searched out beneath, I will also
cast off all the seed of Israel for all
that they have done, saith the Lord."
It is not the Jews who are here re-
ferred to, but that house which was
called the whole house of Israel, all
the seed of Israel, or All Israel-the
great bodyof the people, as contrasted
with the remnant ot Israel, the Jews.
It is Jezreel, the seed of God, that the
Lord oast out of the land, but that
were so cast away in order that they
might be sown among the Illltions--
that the seed might be in many waters
-where they were to spring up as
willows by the water-courses. They
were to remember Him in far coun-
tri-ro live with their children and
turn again, bearing with them the
wealth of all natione aa an offering to
the Lord.
It waa the people who had done all
that we know Israel to have done, as
to foraa.klng the Lord and abusing hie
mercies - neglecting his word, and
persecuting his propheta, and ascribing
that glory to themaelves, or their idols,
that belonged to the only wise God,
their atrong Deliverer- It was the
seed of this people, and not people of
altclf!ether another race in their room,
that the Lord promised to preaerve,
forgiTe, and bless. This is the people
who were to appearance -cast oft', and
in whoae casting olF the inbabitanta
of Jenue.lem appear to have rejoiced.
Long before Jeremiah prophesied,they
bad been carried out of their land,
and conveyed away into what them-
selves seem to have thought hopeleaa
captivity!When aooordinglt they gave
themaelvea up, to be merged among
the Gentiles. But the thoughts of the
Lord were noe 111 man's thoughts, nor
his ways as man's ways. The Lord
was hastening his word to perform it,
and tha1i even u to the mercy pro-
mised unto their fathers. And the
evidence of their not being cast off
will be given, not only in favours out
of the land, but in the fulness of a
blessed return. As truly as the Lord
caused the captivity of Judah to re-
turn from Babylon, so trnly will He
cause the captivity of Israel to return,
as at the first. Truly a people so
recovered may be well prepared to
declare the forgiving grace of God
unto others,whenthemselveshavebeen
made such a signal example of divine
mercy. They will sympathise with
the apostle of the Gentiles, when he
said, " This is a faithful saying, sud
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, of whom I am chief. How-
beit for this cause I obtained mercy,
that in me, first, Jesus Christ might
shew forth all long-suffering, for a
pattern to them which should here-
llf\er believe in him unto life everlast.

Truly may Israel say, as in Psalm
ciii. 10, 11, 13, 17, "He bath not dealt
with WI llf\er our ains, nor rewarded
WI according to our iniquities: For
u the heaven is high above the earth,
great is his mercy towards them that
fear him." "Like aaafatherpitiethhis
children, the Lord pitieth them that
fear him." " The mercy of the Lord
is from everlasting to everlasting upon
them that fear him; and his righteous-
neas unto children's children."
Israel might be lost as to their
earthly parentage; but being begotten
again unto a lively hope by the goe-
pelr-being born again of the incor-
ruptible seed of the Word;-:-Christ
having become to them the Author of
eternal life-they were at length to be
found exclaiming, " Though Abraham

Nor thrown down, any more for ever."
TBB Lord, as the God of Providence
who hath wrought so wondrously in
judgment with regard to both his
people and their land, has, &a we have
seen, pledged himself that he will,
through grace, work as wondrously in
their behalf-in behalf of both Israel
and Judah ; and, having recognised
them as the children of those very
fathers whom He redeemed from
Egyptian bondage, and who broke the
covenant He then m&de with the
ohosen nation-He has promised tore-
ceive these, the descendants of those
undeserving fathers, into the enjoy-
ment of his counsel of peace. The
privileges of the New Covenant, pro-
mulgated in the Gospel, are, therefore,
more especially theirs. Having also
referred to his mighty power as di-
recting, upholding, and controlling,the
various movements of creation, whe-
ther in heaven or upon the earth, He
hath given his word, thRt the people
for whom the covenant was provided,
and who to the eye of man seemed to
be lost, will be preserved unto the
performance of the promises m&de
unto them. And, having alluded to
the immeasurable height of the hea-
vens &nd the unsearchable fonnda.-
tions of the earth, He has declared his
mercy to be equally unw&ustible
with regard to Illl'&el; who, indeed,
seemed to be cast off, but who will
yet be able to inderst&nd the word
that He hath spoken, " I have chosen
thee, &nd not cast thee away."
Yea, although we have Binned
against him, times and ways without
number, his fatherly compassions have
been great towards us still. Although
we had wandered far from him, and
h&d utterly forgotten our resting plaoe,
we were never hid from the eye of our
God; and He hath been overruling
even the physical oh&nges on our globe
for our &dvantag&; and He hath been
instructing us in the laws according to
which the operations of nature are
conducted, that we might avail our-
selves of his knowledgein the produc-
tion of works, whereby to manifest
the power bf the life we have in Him.
And especially hath he, with as con-
stant a course as that whereby the
laws of nature prooeed, sent the offers
of New Testament graoe unto his

people who have been led into the
place prepared; ~d, together with hia
word, hath he al80 sent or provided
the m~s, whereby his truth may be
declared nnto others, as well as en-
joyed by themselves, 80 far as is fit-
ting in their present position ont of
the l~d, which He gave nnto onr fa-
thers, ~d upon which He hath pro-
mised yet to bnild ~d to ~t both
the honse of Israel ~d the house of
Judah.
The distinguished maritime posi-
tion, which the Lord's chosen people
have been given out of the ~d, was
the best fitted for the time and circum-
stances. In no other situation that we
know, could they have been 80 well
prepared, or could they have acquired
such a variety of m~s, or could they
have been 80 free to use these means,
of going forth for the encompassing all
nations, for colonizing all the ends of
the earth, for 80wing the seeds of
peaceful industry in every variety of
80il, among every people, and nnder
every clime. If there hath been un-
faithfulness, it bath been on the part
of man, not on the part of the Father
of Israel: who, while Ephraim was
yet a great way off, bath met and
dealt with him as his first-born. And
equally faithful as He hath been in the
past, will He be in the future u,nto his
promising word. It shall not return
unto him void. It will bring back
the people after whom it was sent.
Theywill return with it in their hands,
their understandings, their hearts, and
their months. From all the ends of
the earth will they return nnto that
land, which hath been lying de80late
without them, to their central inland
position; from which branch ont the
great continents of the old world, to-
gether with seas between, whereby ma-
ritime communication may still be
freely held with the coasts of these
continents, north or 80uth; and, as
well, with the more newly discovered
portions of onr globe, in the east
and the west. This, with the bless-
ing of the Lord, will be fonnd as
eminently fitted for the being a radi-
ating centre, in the time and circum-
stances which are approaching, as bas
been their present abode in those that
are past, for their being 80WU over the
earth-for the depositing their seed in
many waters.
God hath been overrnling their
working : The merchant and manu-
facturer 80Ughttheir gain, and the 801·
dier his glory, and the politician aimed
al\er power. Even among those whose
service ~ht be expected to be more
directly towards the Lord, there have
not been a few who have been look-
ing " every man for his gain from his
quarter." Many have been seeking to
gratify their own whim, or have
merely been indulging a restless spirit
of adventure : But God hath been
overruling it all. His purpose shall
stand, and He will do all His pleasure.
This manner of proceeding, how-
ever, in which men have been bnild-·
ing for themselves, and planting for
themselves, is not that which is to be:
a great IIUd important change is to be
eflected in the motives ofmen, power-
fully infiuencing their conduct, and
resulting in the greatest good to man,
and much glory to the Supreme Dis-
penser of blessing. The rnle which
Christ taught his disciples, but which
hath been 80 long neglected, is ·now to
be followed, " Seek ye first the king-
dom of God, ~d his righteousness;
~d all these things shall be added
unto you." They shall seek righte-
ousness, and peace, and joy in the
HolyGhost: and, acknowledging their
sins, and the sins of their fathers, for
which they were cast out of his inhe-
ritance, they shall lay hold upon his
strength: He had said they maymake
peace with Him; yea, He bath said,
"They shall make peace with Me."
The place of His throne hath long
borne the name of Peace in vain; yet
there will He command the blessing
as at the first; and joy in the Holy
Ghost shall abound, 80 that sorrow
and sighing shall flee away. And all
those things shall be added which are
necessary or good, even for the physi-
cal enjoyment of the people of God.

of Hosts, presents Himself,ver. 35, 36,
as the Creator, the Mighty God, who
upholds creation; who controls alike
the heavenly bodies in their regular
courses, and the raging deep in its
wildest commotion. He whose power
doth accomplish all this, gives hls
word, that the ordinances whereby all
in heaven and on earth is moved, shall
as soon depart from before him, 1\8
Israel shall cease from being a nation
before him for ever.
Fourthly, in ver. 37, we are re-
minded of the extent of tho divine
compassion, of the love of Christ; the
breadth, nnd length, and depth, and
height of which, passeth knowledge.
The height of heaven may as soon bo
measured, or the foundations of the
earth searched out beneath, as that
the mercy of the Lord, towards the
bouse of Israel, can be exhausted-as
that he will cast off all tho house of
Is1"ael, for all that they have done. He
is the everlasting Father, whose mercy
towards His children is unceasing,
everlasting. The house of Israel hath
been esteemed, if not utterly cut off
as a people; yet at least cast away,
and utterly left in heathen c!arkness,
in some obscure corner of the earth:
but it is not so. Although they have
been called Lo-Ruhamall, he hu had
mercy upon them still. He hath ever
been sending after them the messages
ofhis love, although they were so slow
to listen to his fatherly voice.
Fifthly, He is the King of Jertll!a-
lem, the city of peace-Peace it will
pre-eminently enjoy, as being pecu-
liarly the Lord's. It is to be built
to Him. It is to be holy unto the
Lord: and being established thus, in
righteousness, and built up in his loYe,
it shall now abide; and not as hitherto
be trodden under foot by every passer
by. "It shall not be plucked up, nor
thrown down any more for ever."

and the wine, and the oil, the young
of the fiock, and of the herd, but that
God may be honoured in all the earth,
and especially in the place of his ap-
pointment, then shall all things be
added unto them.
The Lord calls attention to what
he here declares; and well may those
who have ears to hear, reiterate the
call, to " Behold " thia avowal of the
divine pt11'pof!8. It is a thought which
few of the disciples of Christ seem as
yet to entertain, that they should be
engaged in any such work as that
which the Lord hath here described.
Many ;seem to think that the Lord
hath so utterly forsaken the place of
the soles of his feet, as that he has
little or no regard to whnt u:ay Lc
doue there; as that He will no more
make it the place of his throne, and
the place where He will dwell in the
midst of the children of Israel for
ever;--As that our King, the son of
David, according to the flesh, will not
sit upon the throne of his father Da-
vid, according to the promise. They
seem to regard as a command the
prediction of our Lord, " The time
cometh when ye shall neither in this
mountain nor yet at Jerusalem, wor-
ship the Father." That certainly was
not a general command with regard to
mount Gerizim or Jerusalem. He
himself frequented Jerusalem after
that saying, even although it cost him
his life, and he told his apostles not to
depart therefrom, until they were en-
dued with power from on high. Nor
were his disciples to desert tha~ city,
until they saw it encompassed with
armies, and when their numbers could
of course only aggravate the horrors
of the siege. The words of our Lord
as to the cessation of spiritual wor-
ship, of the worship of the Father, on
his Holy Mountain at Jerusalem, were
most certainly not intended to convey
a command to those who are every-
where to lift up holy hands without
wrath and doubting. They contained
a predictionwhich has been most lite-
rally verified. The Mahommedan
worship, which alone is tolerated on
the site of the temple at Jerusalem,
most pointedly denies tlW God is a
Father. The Father hath not there
been worshipped in any way, neither
on Gerizim have men been worship-
ping Him in spirit and in truth. But
Is this state of things always to con-
tinue? No. The Lord, having found
what he hath been so long seeking-.
people to worship Him in spirit and
in truth,-the Lord shall inherit Ju-
dah his portion in the Holy Land,
and shall choose Jerusalem again.
There are othera who admit that
the word of prophecy will be found
literally true-that God will at length
accomplish his promising word with
respect to Jerusalem. But they say
that all this will be after the Lord'•
seeond advent-that what we regard
as the sign of his coming, the prepara-
tion ofthe bride, will not be before the
return of the bridegroom-that the
place ofhis feet is not to be prepared-
that Jerusalem, whom He will choose
again, is not to make herself ready-
that his people will not, and should
not, wait for him at the place ap-
pointed-that they should rather flee
away from Zion than seek to comfort
her. Bu~ did not the diseiplet al-
ready flee out of Jerusalem? .j\nd has
not Jerusalem been trodden under
foot of the Gentiles, until the times of
the Gentiles are fulfilled? And i& not
tl1e word clear and uniform, that at
the end of this long desolation, so soon
as the people should come to a know-
ledge of themsalves, and of the occa-
sion of their being cast out among the
Gentiles, whilst the vilest of the hea-
then would be given to dwell in their
empty heritages, they should begin
to pray for the peace of Jeruaalem,
and to seek her good? Jerusalem is
directed to loose herself from the
bands of her neck. She is to be instru-
mental in her own release; Zion is to
put on strength; Jerusalem is to put
on her beautiful garments, and be-
come "the Holy City," through the
being active in her own purification,
and glorioWI preparation for the com-
ing of her Lord. It is of the Lord's
power and holinua, that she is to be
made pure and glorioWI - It is

through the red6lllption which is in his
blood, that she is to be lifted up; but
lltill the COIJllll&Ild is, that she raise
herself up: and the Lord's compla.!nt
is, that at\er she hath wrung out the
dregs of the cup of trembling, there is
none that taketh her by the hand, of
all the sons that she hath brought up.
But this reproach, upon the many
who have been begotten again, by
the word which proceeded from Je-
rnaalem, shall not a.!ways continue:
"Thy children shall make haste; :thy
deetroyers, and they that made thee
waste, shall go fonh of thee, Lift up
thine eyes round about, and see! all
they gather themselves together, and
come to thee. Ail I live, sa.!th the
Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee
with them a.!l, as with an ornament,
and bind them on thee as a bride
doth." These,that thus first assemble
are not unbelieving Jews, but the be-
lieving children ofJoseph, clothed with
the righteousness of the Redeemer of
Israel, the Lord our righteousness.-
TheLordbyEphraim,as found inHim,
will build up the walls of ,Jerusalem,
and gather together the outcasts of
Israe[. These shall be assembled to
that manifestation of those sons of the
Living God, which, as the stones of a
crown, the preparation for the crown-
ing of the King, shall be lifted up as
an ensign upon his land.
Then shall that be,which evidently
has not yet been: but which, as evi-
dently,is to be, upon the very spot the
Lord did of old choose. " Behold the
days come, sa.!th the Lord, that the
city shall be built to the Lord." It
is to be built " to the Lord." He has
expressed h.ii desire with regard to it;
and his people will enter into his de-
sire. It was his desire that a throne
should be placed for him in the most
holy place in the temple, which was
aacordingly built unto hisglory. It is
now his desire that Jerusalem itself
should be prepared as a throne far the
God of the whale earth; that it should
be built far his glary; and then, as
trnly as He filled the moat holy place
with his glory, as sitting upon the
meroyaeat, will He fill the earth with
his glory, while his visible presence
shall abiae over Jeruulem, when the
new J~em shall deecend out of
heaven from God.
The Jerusalem upon earth, wbloh
man is to build unto the Lord, is suf-
ficiently distinguished from the Jeru-
salem above, which the Lord Him-
self hath built. This will come down
tram heaven, whilst that has to be
lifted up, as being built upon her awn
little hill; the localities at which are
given with such particularity, as to
prevent any mistake with regard to
the place de~~igned. It is to be built
"from the tower of Hananeel;" which
appears to have been on the north-
east corner at the city, " to the gate of
the corner" north-westward: but it
is not to stop there: " the measuring
line shall yet go forth over a.ga.inst,
upon the hill Gareb," enoompassing
Gaath, which is supposed to be Gol-
gotha, the place where the Lord lay;
-where was la.!d the foundation stone.
The stretching out of the city is thus
to be westward. And, as to the
south side, "the whole valley of the
dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all
the fields, unto the brook Kidron, shall
be holy unto the Lord."
It does not seem that men will ae-
count any of this portion· their own,
but the Lord's. It will be far the
Lord's service. Unto his glory the
city is to be built: far the entertain-
ment of strangers, far the relief of the
poor and needy; for the sheltering of
the widow and the fa.therleBB; for the
centralization of all means, which the
Lord l!ath given, or maygive, for do-
ing good unto all as we have oppor-
tunity, is this spot to be consecrated
unto the Lord. The Lord intends,
that an this mounta.!n a feast should
be made for all people. And He hath
given directions, saying, " When thou
makest a feast, call the poor, the
ma.!med, the halt, and the blind: and
thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
recolllpense thee; but thou ~t be
recompensed in· the resurrection of
the just." This advice remains to be
followed; and when it shall be fal-
lowed by the Lord's people, in and

from all parts of the world, oontribut-
ing, as to the Lord, and in his sight,
for this manifestation of the power of
redeeming love in the place appointed,
then shall they be blessed, and then
shall be the reoompense in the resur-
rection of the just. May they lay this
to heart! May those who profess to
be the disciples of Jesus think of how
he hath fed, and clothed, and visited,
and oomforted them; and go and do
likewise, and that in the very place
where he shed for them his blood to
redeem them, u.nd to procure for them
all the blessing they enjoy or can hope
to possess; so shall He soon come and
say unto them, " Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto
me."-" Come, ye blessed, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world."
Built up thus in charity, upon that
Foundation of our faith, in the blessed
hope of the resurrection of the saints,
and the glorious return of our Lord,
Jerusalem "shall not be plucked up,
nor thrown down any more for ever."
The nations may rage, and the people
may imagine a vain thing; the kings
of the earth may combine, and the
rulers take counsel together, against
the Lord, and against his anointed:
butHe that sitteth in the heavens shall
laugh; the "Lord shall have them in
derision." Then shall the word be
found true, " Whosoever shall gather
together against thee, shall fall for thy
sake." Think you that He will not
avenge His own Elect, which cry day
and night unto Him, when they are
thus found obedient unto the voice of
their Lord,inthe place of his appoint-
ment? Thoughhe hathhomelongwith
them in their backwardness to obey
his so-plainly-revealed will, or rather
with their blindness and deafness to
his word and working: yet I tell you
that he will avenge them speedily.
Nevertheless-although the command
is so clear, and the encouragement so
great, it may still well be asked,
When the Son of man cometh, shall
He find faith in the earth? Men have
said, He will not. But the Lord hath
not answered so. And we see that
He hath directed far otherwise; and
His promise is to a people that shall
wait for Him at Jerusalem. And our
undoubted duty is to follow the mind
of God as revealed; so shall we find
the promise sure.
RECAPITULATION.
LET us now briefly recapitulate. After
the Bequest-the witnessing of Judg-
ment and Mercy, in the commence-
ment of Jer. xxxi., we saw, in the first
seven particulars, correspondent to the
Seals,v. 8-22, that Israel, in their ut-
terly lost condition, was described in
the centre, whilst He, in whom he has
salvation, is the subject of the first
and the last of these particulars.-
On the contrary, in the last seven
particulars, xxxi. 2-26, which de-
scribe the Heir, Christ's oneness with
his people is the subject of the centre
one. Next to that in the third de-
scription, v. 10 -14, and Mh, v.
18-20, we have the identification of
scattered Israel, and the recognition
of the lost son Ephraim. Outward
from thence we have the place in
which they almll be found, and the
principal way of their retnm p<>inted
out; and first and last we have all the
families of Israel, and the houses of
Joseph and of Judah gathered into
one. The Lord is then the glory in
the midst of larael, and a wall of fire
around them.
The Bequest having been fairly
made out, and the Securities produeed,

SUKlURY OF THE NAKE-JEB. XXXI. 27-40. J29
and the heir in Christ, together with
his circumstances clearly indicated,
the God of Israel has, as we have secri,
added his Name in all its fulness.
First, God is distinctly presented to
us, ver. 27-30, as the God of Provi-
dence; who hath indeed dealt won-
drously with Israel. Of Him they have
often sung-
" God moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform."
He hath been ever watching over
Israel and oYer Judah, to disappoint
them in all their waywardness and
wanderings; that they mightbe taugh£
to seek their rest only in Him. Not
only has He watched over them; He
will nlso do so in the future; but for
& purpose very different, even to build
and to plant them; and He will change
even the great laws of his providence,
so that they shall no longer be in
danger of suffering for the transgres-
sion of their fathers; but every one
shall be dealt with as his individual
ease demands.
Secondly, God is presented as the
Counsellor, \'er. 31-4, as in the fnl-
ness of His compassionate regard,
counselling as to the most effectual
good for both Isrnel and Judah: by tho
blood-shedding of the Lamb of God,&
full atonement bas be'tm mnde: and
thus it is said, " I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin
no more." Thus shall they no more
be ealled " Lo Ruhamah;" the Lord
will fully have mercy upon them,
upon both Isrnel nnd Judah.
But although Judah, or a remnant
of Judah, hns remained in the view of
the world, Jsrnel has been to appear-
ance so entirely lost, that the Lord is
pleased to reiterate his promise again
with regard to tlus house, and that in
the strongest manner, in the two suc-
ceedingparagraphs: the first, asbefore,
regarding their existence as his people,
and the second his having mercy on
~em : tlms reiterating the two names
by which he calls them in Hosea,
Ammi and Ruhamah.
Thirdly, the Most High, the Lord
of Hosts, presents Himself,ver. 35, 36,
as the Creator, the Mighty God, who
upholds creation; who controls alike
the heavenly bodies in their regular
courses, aud the raging deep in its
wildest commotion. He whose power
doth accomplish all this, gives his
word, that the ordinances whereby all
in heaven and on earth is moved, shall
as soon depart from before him, 118
Israel shall cease from being a nation
before him for ever.
Fourthly, in ver. 37, we are re-
nlinded of the extent of tho dhine
compassion, of the love of Christ; the
breadth, and length, and depth, and
height of which, passeth knowledge.
The height of heaven may as soon be
measured, or the foundations of the
earth searched out beneath, as that
the mercy of the Lord, towards the
house of Israel, can be exhausted-as
that he will cast off all the house of
Israel, for all that they have done. He
is the everlasting Father, whose mercy
towards His children is unceasing,
everlasting. The house of Israel hath
been esteemed, if not utterly cut off
as n pecple; yet at least cast away,
and utterly left in heathen i!arkness,
in some obscure comer of the earth:
but it is not so. Although they have
been cmlled Lo-Ruhamah, he hu had
mercy upon them still. He hath ever
been sending after them the messages
ofhis love, although they were so slow
to listen to his fatherly voice.
Fifthly, He is the King of Jerusa-
lem, the city of peace-Peace it will
pre-eminently enjoy, as being pecu-
liarly the Lord's. It is to be built
to Him. It is to be holy unto the
Lord: and being established thus, in
righteousness, and built up in his lo\·e,
it shall now abide; and not as hitherto
be trodden under foot by every passer
by. " It shall not be plucked up, nor
thrown down any more for ever."

L THE WONDERFUL.
xxxn. 1-25.
To moat enlivening promises, re-
llpOOting the great restoration of Israel,
and the rebuilding ofJerusalem, were
given in cin:umstancea well calcu-
lated to teach the important truth,
that the prophecy came not according
to the will of man, but holy men of
God apake as moved by the Holy
Ghost. Jerusalem, as we are told,
ch. xnii. 1-5, was besieged by the
King of Babylon's army; the prophet
bad himself, for declaring the word of
God, been abut up in the court of the
prison: He had thus in his own case
sufficient proof of the guilt of the city;
and of how much it merited the
punishments with which it was threat-
ened. He was, moreover, assured that
thesiegewouldbe successful ; thateven
the King Zedekiah would be led away
captive to Babylon. Nebuchaduez..
zar was greatly exasperated against
the J,ews, and there was no outward
security that the destruction of the
Remnant, by the Babylonians, would
not be as complete, as appeared to
have been that of the great body of
the tribes of Israel, by the Assyrians.
In such circumstances the purchase of
land near Jerusalem would seem not
to be an act prompted by human wis-
dom. Yet then it was that the word
of the Lord, ver. 7, 8, came unto the
prophet, saying, " Behold Hanameel,
the sen of Shallum, thine uncle, shall
come unto thee, eaying, Buy thee my
field that is in Anathoth; for the right
of redemption is thine to buy it.
The announcement or this business
appears to have surprised even the
prophet himself; but when Hnnameel
actually came to him, uttering the
words which had been predicted, then
he knew that he had not been mis-
taken, but that this was actually the
word of the Lord, which was thus
confirmed to him by fact. He acted
accordingly; going through the forms
ofpurchase; as if the Land were free
to be possessed, and as if he were free
to el\ioy the inheritance he redeemed,
ver. 9-12. "And I subscribed theevi-
dence, and sealed it, and took wit-
nesses, and weighed him the money
in the balances. So I took the evi-
dence ofthe purchase, bot:h that which
was sealed acctmling to the law and
custom, and that which was open.
And I gave the evidence of the pur-
chase unto Baruch, the son of Ne-
rialt, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight
of Hana.meel, mine uncle's son, and in
the presence of the witnesses that
subscribed the book of the purchase,
before all the Jews that sat in the
court of the prison."
Jesus is our Kinsman Redeemer,
He hath not only redeemed for us the
lost Inheritance, but He hath re-
deemed us for himself, with his own
blood. Though He was rich, yet for
our sakes He became poor, that we,
through his poverty, might be made
rich. He hath done all things ac-
cording to the law. The Land of pro-
mise belongs to our Lord, not only
Digitized by Coogle
by right of' cleation1 it ia oar Im-
~uel'a Land byright of'redemption.
And it can be fairly oJaivled in his
name, byauch aa can in truth produce
the title-deedt.
That the title deeds, the dooumeuts
referred to, were long to remain sealed,
or unopened, appears to have been in-
.timated in what immediately follows,
ver. 13-US, "And I charged Baruch
before them, saying, Thus aaith the
Lord of Hoste, the God oC Israel"-
Be it observed, that it is aa " the God
of Israel," and notof the Jews only; aa
"the Lordof Hosts," and not of a rem-
nant merely, that the Most High gives
directions as to this matter. •• Take
theee evidenoea, thia evidence of the
purchase, both which is sealed, and
this evidenoe which is open, and put
them in an earthen vessel, that they
may oontiuue many daya."
It may be observed that Neriah
means Lamp of tAe Lord, as Baruch
doea Ble#ittg-" Blessed is he that
readeth" the book, repl'988nted by that
which was deposited by Baruch; and
has that word aa a light to his feet,
and a lamp to his path.-ln prepara-
tion for the battle of Midian, Judges
vii. 16, lampa were plaoed ill earthen
vessela; and the eudden shining forth
of the lights from out the darkness,
when th11 pitehere w•re broken, ver.
19, appears to ltave had much to do
with the diacomfitore of the enemy.
To tbia matter is there a reference,
ll Cor. iv. 6, 7? "For God, who com-
manded the light to shine out of
darkneu, hath shined in our hearts, to
the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ:
But we have this treasure in earthen
YeUels, that the exoellency oC the
~r may be of God, aad not of us."
The treasure is the word of God, pre-
a.enting the deeds of purchase; the
evidenees of what hath been done for
us by our Kinsman Redeemer. In Him
is the fulfilment of the promise ex-
pressed in the name Jeremiah, The
Lord .W Ni&e tlp.-Aud He shall
again desoend, when those appointed
go fortll tomeet Him, with their lamps
trimmed and their lights burning.-
; 2
Then thoae recorda, which have been
lefl; in comparative obscurity many
days, will be freely read, and plainly
understood, and fully acted upon, by
those who, by the grace of God,
throngh Him who bath been raised up
for them, have been made heirs of
God and joint heirs with Christ. 8oou
may darkening self be removed, pri-
vate interpretations cease, and the
prophesying in part bo done away;
and the clear light of divine truth
shine fully forth, for the diacomfitore
of the powers of darkneu, and the de-
liveranoe of his people. Then will
they have communion in the light.
The immediate purpose, for which
the lign of purchase thus was made
by Jeremiah, is then stated, ver. 15,
" For thus eaith the LollD of Hosts,
the God of Israel, houses, and fields,
and vineyards, shall be possessed
again in this land." It is to be &«&in
observed, that it is as the Lord of
H01u, as the God of l8rael, that the
Lord promises the re-inbabiting and
peaceable possession of the Land of
Promise. The colonization of the
Land by either Jews or Gentiles, and
not by Israel, would not answer the
expectation here, as elaewhere, held
out to us in the word of prophecy.-
Even Israel's dwelling there as under
a foreign yoke, and not in absclute
possesaion, as under the God of their
fathers, would not fill np the promise;
and when the promise is fulfilled, it is
only, as it were, the sign of a far more
important possession, about to be re-
alized by all the children of God, in
resurrection glory.
The prophet prophesied as be was
commanded: but it is evident, from
the conclusion of his prayer, recorded
ver. 16-25, tha.t be did not fully un-
derstand his own prophecy, or how it
could be accomplished. Had he acted
aoeording to his own knowledge or in-
clination, or spoken his own thonghts,
he wonld not have acted as he did, or
uttered words such as, by the Spirit of
God, he was moved to utter.
In his perplexity he addressed him-
lelf to Him who conld alone resolve
lUs doubts, and diecloae to him ihe

secreta of wiadom: ver. 16, "Now
when I had delivered the evidence of
the purchase unto Baruch, the son of
Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord:"
First-As the Creator, the Mighty
God, ver. 17, 18: "Ah, Lord God!
Behold, thou hast made the heaven
and the earth, by thy great power and
stretched-out arm,and there is nothing
teo hard~ or wonderful" for thee."-
His might is alike manifested in the
fulfilment of promise, to the children
of promise, and in the execution of
threatening upon those who dare the
divine wrath: " Thou shewest loving
kindness unto thousands, and recom-
pensest the iniquity of the fathers into
the bosom of their children at\er
them." " The Great, the Mighty God,
the Lord of Hosts is his name."
Second-He is then o.cknowledged
as the Counsellor, ver. 19,-" Grea.tin
Counsel and Mighty in work; for
tlai.ne eyea are open upon all the ways
of the sons of men, to give every one
according to his ways, and according
to the fruit of his doings: " And here,
indeed,the divine counsel wasrequired,
to reconcile this strict execution ·of
justice, with the bestowment of mercy:
upon the guilty.-This can only be
through their being brought into new
covenant blessing; through their be-
ing made one with Him who hath
made satisfaction for sin, and brought
In everlasting righteousness; and who
bath engaged to write his law upon
the hearts of his restored people, de-
positing it in their inward pam-
working all their works in them.
Third-Correspondent to the name
Wonderfol, ar God of Providence,
the prayer then proceeds, verse
liO-ll!!, " Which hast set signs and
wonders in the land of Egypt, mm
unto this day, and in Israel, and
among ot.Wr men; and hast made thee
11 Name as at this day; and hast
brought forth thy people Israel out of
the land of Egypt, with signs and with
wonders, and with a strong hand, and
with a stretched-out arm, and with
great terror."-His wonder-working
power, as the God of Providence, was
abundantl7 displayed in the bringing
his people ant of the land of Egypt,
leading them through the Red Sea;
and conducting and training them in
the wilderness; and in afterwards
giving them the Land which he aware
to their fathers to give them : a land
at that time flowing with milk and
honey. ";And they came in and pos-
IIO&sed it; but they obeyed not thy
voice, neither walked in thy law: they
have done nothing of all that thou
commandedst them to do." He had
dealt wondrously with them in kind-
ness, as he had promised; but he had
to deal with them as wondrously in
judgment, according to the threaten-
ing& of that covenant, under which
they had been given possession of the
land. " Therefore thou hast caused
all thie evil to come upon them: Be-
hold the mounts; they are come unto
the city to take it; and the city is
given into the hand of the Chaldeans
that fight against it, because of the
sword, and the famine, and the pesti-
lence. And what thou hast spoken
is come to pass; and behold thou
aeest it." How trying to the faith
were circumstances such as these, in
which to receive such a commission as
that which he had received! The
prophet felt that God is indeed won-
derful. " And thou hast said unto
me, 0 Lord God, buy thee the field
for money, and take witnesses: though
the city is given into the hand of the
Cbaldeansl" The prophet, even after
recognizing the Lord as tho Mighty
God, as the Counsellor, as the
Wonderful, appears to have been
surprised at the words he Wl\8 made
to utter, so seemingly inconsist-
ent as they were with the circum-
stances in which he was placed: But
he acts wisely in going to Him who
could resolve hia doubts by making
plain his own words. And the Lord
condescends, again and again, to con-
firm his word of promise; and that
at\er a full recognition of the guilt
both of Israel and Judah; and of the
utter pollution of the place he hath
more especially promised to deliver;
and wherein he hath purpoaedto ble11
his people, lifting them up for ever.

JEB, XXXII. 26-44.
THE LOBD'8 RECOGNITION OF THE UXWORTBINE118 OF IIIRAEL .U UJIDU
TBB LAW.
VEB8E8 26-35.
" THEN came the word of the Lord
unto Jeremiah, saying, Behold, I am
the Lord"-the ever-living Jehovah,
" the God ofall flesh," as which, He will
be manifested, when will take place
the manifestation of the sons of God:
He is able to bring them forth, and
to fulfil to them all He hath promised,
notwithstanding their utter unworthi-
ness, and their being, to appearance,
entirely lost. This may seem difficult
of accomplishment, but, saith the
Lord, " Is there anything too h11rd "
or wonderful " for me?"
The C&Se of the city is declared,
ver. 28, 29; of Israel and Judah, ver.
30; and again that of the city, ver.
31; and again that of Israel and Ju-
dah, ver. 32; their sin of omission, or
refusal to receive instruction, ver. 33;
their sins of commission, instanced in
the defilement of his aanctU11fY, ver.
34; and in building high places to
Baal, and committing other idola-
trous abominations, ver. 35. There is
thus a clear and repeated recognition
ofboth place and people; and of their
guilt or unworthiness, in all respects:
so that there can be no doubt as to
who are the people, and what is the
place referred to in the words that
follow.
l. The then approaching ruin of
Jerusalem, and the weight of guilt, as
to idolatry, which was about to in-
volve in destmction the appointed
place of the J..ord's throne, are inti-
mated, ver. 28, 29, " Therelore thus
.s!Uth the Lord; Behold I will give this
city into the hand of the Chaldeans,
and into the hand of Nebucbadrezzar,
King of Babylon, and be shall take
it." The city was, in effect, taken in
the fourth month of the eleventh year
of Zedekiah's reign, and between the
seventh and tenth days of the suc-
ceeding month, the Chaldeans, having
returned from the pursuit and capture
of the fugitive king, accomplished the
Jlredicted vengeance, " And the Chal-
dcans that fight against thig city, shall
come and set fire on this city, and
burn it, with the houses, upon whose
roofs they have offered incense unto
Baal, and poured out drink-offerings
unto other gods, to provoke me to
anger."
2. The extent of the evil, which
the Lord recognises in his professed
people, and which required to be
avenged, was great. Its length and
breadth are thus stated, ver. 30, "For
the children of Israel, and the children
of Judah, have only done evil before
me from their youth." Both the one
bouse and the other, bad thus lost all
claim, in theirown right, to the peace-
ful possession of the Land.
3. The particular form of evil with
which they 11re charged,was idolatry-
the practical rejection of the Lord
from being their God: their denying
themselves to be his people, by giving
themselves up to the worship of idols,
as is intimated in ver. 30, "For the
children of Israel have only provoked
me to anger with the work of their
hands, saith the Lord."

4. The aggravation of their accu-
mulated guilt, as in the case of the
capital, both the nations, and all orden
of the people, from the highest to the
lowest, is noticed, ver. 31, llll, "For
this city hath been to me a provoca-
tion of mine anger and of my fury,
from the day that they built it, even
unto this day; that I should remove
it from before my face," &c.
5. Their manner of acting with re-
gard to the instructions he was pleased
to bestow on them; their contemptu-
ous disregard of the words of his co-
venant, is intimated, ver. 33, " And
they have turned unto me the back,
and not the face: though I taught
them, rising up early and teaohing,
yet they have not hearkenod to receive
Instruction." They shewed their re-
jection of the Lord by their neglect of
his word.
6. The length to which they had
gone in rejection of the Lord, the co-
venant God of Israel, is stated, ver.
34, " But they set their abominations
in the house, which is called by name,
to defile it." They had thus made
themselves a loathing to the Lord, even
in the house which had been profes-
sedly set apart to His service.
7. But the weight of their guilt is
again to be considered, in the nature
of the sacrifices they were willing to
make, on behalf of gods that could
not profit them: v. 35. " They built
the high places of Baal, which are in
the valley of the son of Hinnom, to
aause their sons and their daughters
to pass through the fire unto Molecb,
which I commanded them not; neither
oame it into my mind,that they should
do this aboulination, to cause Judah
to sin."
It would be difficult to identify
people ed place, or to describe for-
feiture of the inheritu.noe, more fully
than we have seen done. The chil-
dren of Israel, brought out of Egypt,
who afterwards were divided into the
two houses of Israel and Judah, and
who had eo remained unprofited by
the Lord's teaching; who had de-
filed the Lord's Banctnary, and eo
utterly corrupted their ways! Jeru-
salem,which bad been eo distinguished
by guilt, and which was to be,
and has been, so remarkably distin-
guished in judgment-These are un-
doubtedly the people and place re-
ferred to in the succeedingpromises.
The foregoing sevenfold description
of the evil which was found in Israel,
as under the Law, may be contrasted
with the following fulnesa of ble88ing
-the good to be bestowed upon the
children of promise, according to the
Gospel.
THE COmfi!EL 01' P.B.A.CB1 .A.CCORDll{G TO THE GOSPEL.
VEL 36-44.
lsR.l.BL has been reoognised as ut-
terly nmvorthy in themselves: " And
now, therefore, thus saith the Lord,
the God of Israel, concerning Tms
CITY whereof ve ~&y, It shall be deli-
vered Into the hand of the King of
Babylon, by the sword, and by the
famine, and by the peatilence." There
surely can be no doubt as to the place
here pointed out. It is Jeruaalem.
Neither can there be any doubt u to
the people.
First-The Lordaays, ver. 37," Be-
hold I will gather them out of all
countries, whither I have driven them I
in mine anger, and in my fury, and in
great wrath:" At. surely as Israel
was driven away in wrath, are they
to be gathered out of all countriea,
and that by the Lord himaclf.
Well may it be said, when such an
assembling of all Israel to Jerusalem
shall take plaoe, " Who can count the
dust of Jacob?" Then will they be
astonished at their own previous
darkness and defilement, and at the
multitude of the Lord's meroies to-
wards a people so unworthy.
Second-The place unto which the
return is to be, is as distinctly marked
in the end of ver. 37: " And I will
bring them again unto this place."-
Tbat Jerusalem is meant, there can be
no doubt; and the return hers referred
Digitized byGoogle
to, cannot be any which has yet taken
place; for it follom, " And I will
cause them to dwell safely." Compare
ch. :uiii. 6, with ch. xxxlli. 16, by
which it may be seen, that Israel is
distinguished from Judah, and iden-
tified with Jerusalem, n.s dwelling
safely.
Third-Theyhad rejected the Lord
from being their God, and were made
Not his people; but now these are the
marks whereby they shall be known.
" And they shall be my people, and
I will be their God," ver. 38. He will
be known as emphatically the God of
Israel; and they shall be known to be
in truth the people of the Lord.
Fourth - The oneness of Christ
with his people is plainly intimated,
ver. 39: " I will give them one heart,"
which can only be by their being given
the mind of Jesus, and being given to
say with Him," Thy will be done-"
"and one way-that they may fear
me for ever."-This is a unity of spi-
rit and worship which is to continue,
"for thegood ofthem,and oftheir chil-
dren after them." It is clear, that the
words do not refer altogether to ano-
ther state of existence; when the per-
sons referred to shall neither marry
nor be given in marriage. Nor can
they be applied to a state in which
there has not been inward, as well as
outward, uniformity.
This has not, :as yet, been to All
Israel; but it is to be: and that in tlte
present life: else how can it be said to
be for the good of their children e.fter
them, as well as for their own good?
ln the name of Jesus every knee
shall bow, and every tongue confess,
that he is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father.
Fifth-The recognition which Is
made of the people of promise is that
of their being objects of gospel mercy.
They are restored, not as under the
law; but thu8 are they his people,
ver. 40. " And I will make an ever-
lasting covenant with them, that I
will not turn away from them, to do
them good." This is the favour with
which the returning prodigal is re-
ceived, as being thoroughly convinced
135
of the folly and evil of his own ways,
as returning with one heart, in the
one way appointed of the Father-as
being given the adoption or sonahip,
in Him who alone is worthy: and his
people thus brought to Him, God on-
gages to keep, so that they will turn
from Him no more. " But I will put
my fear in their hearts1 that they
shall not depart from me." This,
certainly remains to be done to them
as a people. But the Everlasting
God, the Covenant-kseplng God, has
fully engaged to do it; and it must be
done. And it will be done by their
being unlike their stiffneeked fathers,
through their being given to hearken
diligently unto his word. See Isa. lv.
Sixth-The words, v. 41, "Yea, I
will rejoice over themtodotbemgood,"
imply, that joy in the Holy Ghost will
be richly bestowed; and that an abun-
dant entrance will be given into the
good word of God. The Church of
the first-born will be enriched by Him
in all utterance, and all knowledge.
The prayer will be answered-" Thy
Spirit is good. Lead me into the land
of uprightness."
Nothing shallbe wanting that is ne-
cessary to bring them into the bless-
ing designed; and for this there must
be a return to the .very land from
which they were cast out, and which
is surely sufficiently indicated, when
it is said, "And I will plant them in
this land, assuredly "-that ia, in truth
or stability, upon the one all-sufficient
Foundation laid In Zion-" with my
whole heart, and with my whole soul"
They are now to be found in a very
different case than when they were a
loathing to the Lord, as defiling his
house with their abominations. Now
will He delight in his people. Since
these words were spoken, it surely can-
not be said, that the Lord has planted
any people in that land, with his whole
heart, and his whole son!. And this
was to be, and must yet be, according
to the everlasting covenant ordered in
all things,and sure. Oh, what blessing
must abound to the people (and they
are the very people of Israel, whose
fathers were outcasts) who shall be

truth, the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with his whole hew:t, and

Seventh-The salvation of Judah
(which peoplo were present with the
prophet, and inhabited Jerusalem)
is also declared, ver. 42-44, lUI in the
Seventh ·Thunder-" For thus saith
the Lord, Like as I have brought all
thisgreat evil upon this people, sowill I
bring upon them all the good that I
have promised them." The evil hath
manifestly come, and hath been evi-
dently resting upon tho remnant of
Israel, 1111 being out of Cl1rist; but as
truly will these, the brethren of Christ,
according to the fle@h, return unto the
children of Israel, who shall have pre-
viously been made one with Him
whom his brethren shall prnise; and
so shall the Jews be received into
blessing, along with the whole house
of Israel. And blessed they can be,
only as participating in the blessing
of the first-born, the people who were
made not a people, according to the
law, that they might become the more
truly the people of God according to
the gospel: Having no confidence in
the flesh, but their entire trust in Him
in whom the covenant is fully and for
ever established.
All thi• promised good the Lord
will give: A pledge thereofwas given
in the partial return of the remnant
from llabylon, "And fields shall be
bought in this land, whereof yc say, It
is desolate without man or beast; it
is given into the hand of the Chal-
deans. :Men shall buy fields for mo-
ney, and subscribe evidences, and
seal them, and take witne88es in the
land of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of
Judah; and in the cities ofthe moun-
tains, and in the cities of the valley,
and in the cities of the south. For I
will cau~e their capth·ity to return,
aaith the Lord." Soon may Israel
enjoythis promised return to theirown
cities. Soon may the songbe sung-
" Thou nrt worthy to tuke the Book, and te open tl1e Seals thereof:
For thou wast >lain,and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
Out of e\·cry kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
And hast mnde us nnte our God kings and pri~.>ts:
And w~ shall reign on the earth."

III. THE MIGHTY GOD.
JER. XXXIII. 1-18.
HERE is declared the Lord's ability
to accomplish that which is written
in the Book of the Covenant; which,
as we have seen, is established upon
better promises than those given
according to thelaw. The Lord con-
firms his word: " Moreover, the word
of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the
second time, while he was yet shut up
in the court of the prison, saying,
Thus sniththe Lord, the Maker there-
of, the Lord that formed .it, to e•ta-
blish it." He is the Creator of Israel,
whose power is equal to the accom-
plishment of all he hath I_>urposed with
regard to them. He is the Maker of
Israel, a people fonned for himself, to
shew forth his 'praise. And He hath
been working· witli them, not merely
to scatter them, and bring them to
nought; but toestablish them, accord-
ing to his everlasting covenant. Yas,
He will claim them as his own, so.y-
ing, as in Dent. xxxii. 6, " Do ye thus
requite the Lord, 0 foolish people and
unwise? Is not He thy Father that
hath bought thee; hath he not made
thee, and established thee? " True,
they arc dead in themselves, but
in Him is life. Jehovah, He which

is, and which was, and which is to
come; the Source and Giver of life;
" The Lord is his name." - But
how is the Blessing to be ob-
tained? How are the Seals to be
opened? How the Book to be un-
closed, in the reading of which the
blessing is more especially promised?
It is neither by indolent waiting, nor
by anxious study, of the word itself;
and far less, the writings of fallible
men. The Lord hath prescribed the
way. " Call unto me, and I will ans-
wer thee." There must be equally au
earnest calling unto the Lord, and a
careful attention to the answer he
vouchsafes, in whatever way He is
pleased to speak. There must be
simplicity of mind in seeking, first, the
kingdom of God, and his righteous-
DeMo So will he fulfil his word, " and
shew thee great and mighty," or
hidden, " things, which thou knowest
not." We must be convinced of our
own previous ignorance if we would
really have the teaching of God; and
of our own weakness, if we would see
the might of God put forth in our de-
liverance and blessing. " The meek
will he guide in judgment, the meek
will he teach his way."
What immediately follows appears
to be in the order of the Seven Seals
already dwelt upon, pages 25-56.
In order to enter into the mystery
of Divine Providence, and see the ap-
propriateness of the language used in
divine revelation, it is necessary to
understand, how God might be tho
God of Israel, even when destroying
the Jews: who had magnified them-
selves against Israel, rejoiced in their
expulsion from the land, and exclu-
sion from the covenant mercy pro-
mised to the fathers. Let us clearly
distinguish between Israel and Judah
(the inhabitants of Jerusalem) when
we read such words as these: " For
thus aaith the Lord, the God of Israel,
concerning the houses of this city, and
concerning the houses of the Kings of
Judah, which are thrown down bv the
mounts, and by the sword. 'i'hey
come to fight with the Chaldeans; but
it is to fill them with the dead bodies
of men, whom I have slain in mine
anger, and in my fury, and for all
whose wickednesa I have hid my face
from this city." Thus, in the appoint-
ment of God, the city, as posseased by
the Jews, was given to the spoil, and
the people to the sword. And this
destruction came upon it in their
hands, not only from the Babylonians,
but still more cruelly from the Ro-
mans, whose sovereignty they pre-
ferred to that of their rightful King,
whom they delivered up to be cru-
cified.
But as trnly as Ill! the threatened
judgment hath come upon the Jews,
will God, as the God of Israel, accom-
plish the promise to Jerusalem, ver.
6: " Behold I will bring it health and
cure." He, the good Physician, hath
come, and been rejected of Jerusnlem;
but he is not to be turned back from
his purpose. He died that we might
live; and he is exalted, " to give re-
pentance to Israel and the remission
of sins: " and through Him, the ltfe&t
Redeemer, our most gracious Saviour,
the Salvation shall be enjoyed by his
people Israel, and this will be mani-
fested even in Jerusalem. The Lord
will do it, as He !Jath said, " And I
will cure them." Then will the vail
which hath been spread over all na-
tions be removed-then will the book
be opened, as here i' is said, " And I
will reTeal unto them the abundanoe
of peace and truth." Then will be the
time of Israel's Salvation: of which
Salvation He who hath come to wash
us from our sins in his own blood, and
to make us unto Himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works, will be
seen, as indoed the cause. This is
written in his very name Jesu&-He
shall save his people from their sins.-
(Compare herewith the First Seal,
pages 25-29.)
Second-The return of Israel'scap-
tivity is recognisen to be to the en-
joyment of peace, ver. 7, ns before
intim!lted in the Second Seal. Had
only the captivity of Judah been spo-
ken of, the promise might, by some,
have been rogardcd as fulfilled in tho
Jews' return from :!3a.bylon. But

eTen granting that then was the re-
turn of the captivity of Judah, that
was not the retnm of Israel's capti-
vity, aa here distinctly marked, "And
I will cause the captivity of J udab,
and the captivity of Iarael, to return."
And surely this has never been ful-
filled-" And will build them aa at
the first." The glory of the kingdom
of David and Solomon never has been
restored to Jerusalem; but more than
this is promised-when the Lord will
take, of backsliding Israel, one of a
city, and two of a family, and bring
them to Zion; when the Lord will re-
store her judges aa at the first, and
her counsellors ns at the beginning.-
Then the abundance of the seas shall
be converted unto her, the forces of
the Gentiles shall come unto her;
then she is to see peace.-(See Second
Seal, pages 29-32).
Third- The contrast of Israel's
case with that of other nations, which
was dwelt upon under the third Seal,
is again adverted to here, v. 8, 9. All
has happened that they might be pre-
pared, aa a people, to shew forth the
praises of the Lord, when his goodness
shall be bestowed upon them, to the
degree of making all the nations of
the earth to fear and to tremble:-
which well may be, were they his own
United People, in the holiness and fa-
vour here described-" And I will
cleanse them from all their iniquity,
whereby they have sinned against me;
and I will pardon all their iniquities
whereby they have sinned, and where-
by they haTe trantgrelll!ed against me."
Jerusalem then will be holy, and
there will the Lord command the
blessing: "And it shall be to me a
name of joy: "-no longer a name ef
reproach, which it was painful to hear,
because of the numberless evils with
which it was associated. In the sight
of all the nations, it hath been lying
In desolation and the deepest degrada-
tion. Not so now: it shall be "a
praise and an honour before all the
nations of the earth, which shall hear
all the good that I do unto them."-
This may well be: the people con-
templated in the blessing, having al-
ready intimate connection with all
the great families of mankind, and
having such unprecedented facilities
for publishing the Lord's goodness over
all the earth. Then shall Jerusalem
tremble no more under the rod-nay,
under the feet of the oppressor. The
cup of trembling shall be taken out
of her hand, and put into that of her
ene!llles:-" And they shall fear and
treQible, for all the goodness, and for
all the prosperity, that I procure unto
it." This contrast of Israel's case
with that of other nations, compare
with the Third Seal, pages 33-35.-
The contrast will not be the less
striking in the land, than it has been
O'Jt of it.
Fourth-The ease of Jerusalem aa
utterly helpless in itself, and the re-
covery by the Lord of that which was
lost (the captivity of the laud), is next
adverted to, ver. 10, 11: "Thus saith
the Lord, Again there shall be heard
in this place, which ye say shall be
desolate, without man, and without
beast." The place is sufficiently iden-
tified:-" Even in the cities of Judah,
and in·the streets of Jemaalem; that
aredesolate without man, and without
inhabitant, and without beast." There,
even in the streets ofJerusalem, shall
be hea.rd a very different sound from
what at this time prevails there, " The
voice ofjoy, and the voice of gladness
-the voice of the bridegroom, and the
voice of the bride." Social and do-
mestic happin888 are there to abound;
and, equally, that of holy worship;-
the expression of grateful praise to the
Giver of 1111 good, who will have
granted deliverance to Israel, who will
abundantly have blessed the people of
his choice. There, accordingly, will
be heard " The voice of them that
shall say, Praise the Lord of Hosts"
-the Lord, not of a remnant merely,
but the Lord of Host8. " For the
Lord is good"-He will be found pre-
sently blessing his people1 and they,
looking back upon all tne way in
which he hath led them; and seeing
how he hath been ever following them
with his covenant mercy, and is now
known by them aa their covenant God
Digitized by Coogle
I
fbr ever-they will sing, " For his
mercy endurttA for ever.~ Tiley will
not be ashamed of their devotion to
the Lord. There, in the streets of
Jerusalem, will be beard the joyful
voice of them that l!ball bring the ea-
crifice of praise Into the house of the
Lord. And all this, " For I will cause
to return the captivity," not of a frag-
ment of the people, but " of the land,
as at thefirst, aalth the Lord."-(Com-
parewithFourtb Seal,pages36-40.)
Fmh-The contrast of Israel's case
in the land, with the desolation of the
land as possessed by other nations, ap-
pears to be clearly intimated, ver. 12,
13: " Thus saith the Lord of Hosts,
.Again in this place, which is desolate,
without man, and without beast, and
in all the cities thereof, shall be an
habitation of shepherds, causing their
flocks to lie down."-" In tile cities
of the mountains" as of Lebanon and
Baaban at the northern extremity of
the Land; "And In the cities of the
vale"-of Jezreel more southward;
" and in the cities of the south," where
were the portions of Simeon and Dan:
These belonged to the kingdom of Is-
rael. ".And In the land of Benjamin,"
the most:nortbern portio!~ of the king-
dom of Judah; "And m the places
about Jerusalem; and in the cities of
Judah," the most northern portion of
this latter kingdom.
It may be noticed that the
same threefold division of the por-
tions of Israel and Judah was made
before, ltltltii. 44, only that the three
divisions of the land belonging to J u-
dah, which were there given first, are
here mentioned last.
Over the whole land, both of
Israel and Judah, shall be peace and
plenty. Then " shall the flocks pass
again under the hands of him that
telleth them."-This contrast to the
desolation, which hath onrspread tlte
whole land, remains yet to be given.
He who hath made the case cL the na-
tions that have come ofJacob, so much
in oontrast to that ofthe nations among
whom they have come, will equally
make their condition in the land a
contrast to that of the nations who
139
have spoiled it. The Lord bath pro-
mised, and He will perform.-(Se6
the Fifth Seal, pages 41-44.)
Sixth-The Return of Israel and
Judah, to the fulness of the Blessing,
is here again assured, ver. 1.f.," Behold
the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will perform that good thing which I
have promised unto the house of Israel,
and to the house ofJudah." The good
which is promised to be given, upon
the Restoration of both the houses of
Israel, must at least include righteous-
ness, and peace, and joy, In the Holy
Ghost; that full cup of joy which the
Lord"intends to put into the hands of
his people-the JOY of the harvest, as
contrasted with that of the first fruits
of the Spirit, bestowed on the day
of Pentecost.
Then will be eeen the truth of Ja-
cob's words in blessing him, upon
whose Head the fulness of the bless-
ing was to come, Gen. xlix. 22. " Jo-
seph is a fruitful bough-a fruitful
bough by a well;-branches run over
the wall." Although not found within
the wall, which was to be broken
down, Eph. ii. 14-18, it will be seen
that he hath grown up into that ful-
ness of nations, unto whom the pro-
mises were to be sure, when In tm-
circumoision, as was our father

Husband that is put upon her, even

of blessing is to be found. Israel is

Seventh- The Cause of Israel's
Mlvation, Christ, their King or Go-
vernor, their all-prevailing Intereeisor,
the Man who can approach the eter-
nal Majesty, with acceptance, in be-
half of his people, and procure for
them the promised blessing, is here
again adverted to: "For thus saith
the Lord, Daviol shall never want a
man," or there shnll not be cut off
from David, " A Man to sit upon the
throne of the house of Israel." It is
true that the Man, Christ Jesus, was
to appearance cut off, but not for
Himself. It was in order that he
might more fully accomplish the work
which was given Him to do, in behalf
of the people who were to be united
unto Him for ever. He was not only
to reign over them as a King, but re-
present them as a Priest. He was
firlit to go unto the Father, before be-
ing manifested in his great power, as
the Governor who should rule His
people Israel. He who was, in Beth-
lehem, born of the sceol of David, hath
approached the Father for us. He
hath gone to procure for Israel a pre-
paration for the promised blessing.
And the }'ather hath said to Him,
" Sit at my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool." Then
He, who is in reserve for the throne of
his father David, will condescend to
sit upon that throne, as truly as He
condescended to take unto Him our
very nature from the Virgin's womb.
He is our Melohizedek. " He shall sit
as a Priest upon his throne." He hath
an everlasting priesthood : and so it is
here said, " Neither shall the Priests,
the Levites, want a man, before me,
to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle
meat offerings, and to do sacrifice con-
tinually." This is He who continu-
eth ever-who hath by one offering
for ever perfected them that are sanc-
tified: so that there needeth no more
sacrifice for sin. His sacrifice is of
perpetualefficacy; and upon the ground
thereof, will there be offered the sacri-
fices of pmyerand praise continually;
and such other sacrifices as are well
pleasing unto God, through Jesus
Christ Oil\' Saviour. ONE, even the
Son of David, is not only our King,
but our Priest, for e\·er. His sacri-
fice is sufficient. His intercession all
prevailing. He hath prevailed to open
the Book, and to loose the Seven
Seals thereo£-(Compare this with

Father to the numerous posterity pro-

It was shown from the very beginning
that the being merely the seed of
Abraham, according to the flesh, did
not avail The children of promise
were counted for the seed. Else why
should Isaac be chosen, to the rejec-

YB KU8T BB BORN AGAIN.
The covenant was with regard to One
Seed, a Son to come of the tribe of
Judah, One whom his brethren should
prai-the Shiloh, the One Sent, unto
whom the gathering of the people
should be, Gen. xlix 8-IO. It also
regarded this people, the multitu-
dinous seed, who were especially to
come of the two families of Joseph,
Gen. xlviii. 2-20. Of Joseph more
particularly was to come the body,
upon the Head of which the fulness
of the blessing was to come, Gen. xli:L
25, 26. The blessing could only be
enjoyed by a people found under the
Head; as being gathered into Oneness
with Christ; as being given newness
of life in Him; as being bom again of
the incorruptible seed of tho word,
which liveth and abideth for ever;-
as being begotten again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of J esua
Christ from the dead; as being made
the children of God by faith in Christ
Jesus, who was of the seed of David
according to the flesh; and declared to
be the Son of God, with power, ac-
cording to the Spirit of holiness, by
the resurrection from the dead.
It is as looking to Jesus, and as see-
mg the numerous posterity, promised
unto the fathers, regenerated, or bom
again, through the power of his word,
that we see the meaning of what fol-
lows: " And the word of the Lord
came unto Joremish, saying, Thus
saith the Lord, If ye can break my
covenant of the day, and my covenant
of the night; and that there should
not be day and night in their season;
then may also my covenant bo broken
with David my servant, that he shoold
not have a son to reign upon his
throne; and with the Levites, the
priests, my ministers." A son hath
been bom of the family of David, in
whom the Levitical priesthood bath
boen aupeneded; and Iince whose
ascension, into the holiest of all, the
rudimental service of the tabernacle
upon earth, hath been done away:-
"And being made perfect, He became
the Author of eternal salvation unto
all them that obey Him. Called of
God an High Priest after tho order of
Melchizedek, of whom we have many
things to say and bard to bo uttered,
seeing yc are dull of bearing," Heb. v.
9-11. Listen.to the call, Ia. Iv. 3:
" HEAR and your souls shall live;
and I will make an everlasting cove-
nant wi~h you, the sure mercies of
David." And Ezek. X."<xvii. 4, " 0
ye dry bones, IIEAR yo the word of
tlie Lord." And Jer. xui. IO, "HEAR
the word of the Lord, ye nations," or
Gentiles, " and declare it in the isles
afar off." So may He see His seed, in
a people who were called Lo-ammi, or
Gentiles, dwelling in these isles afar
off: they being found sons of the living
God, through the power of his life-
giving word.
When, by His word and Spirit, the
lost house of Israel are made to stand
upon their feet, an exceeding great
anny, then will Jesus be found indeed
the second Adam, and this word will
be found true: and it can only be
found true in Him, and in the natural
seed being made the spiritual seed,
through his regenerating word: " As
the host of heaven cannot be num-
bered, neither the &ILild of the sea
measured; 80 will I multiply the seed
of David my servant, and the Levites
that minister unto me." That word
will bo found true: "If ye be Christ's,
then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise:" which pro-
mise was to be enjoyed in the son of
David. Out of Him it is vain to look
for the blessing; and all that will have
it in Him are welcome. In Him " ye
are a chosen generation, a royal priest-
hood, an holy nation, a peculiar
people; that ye should show forth the
praises of Him, who hath called you
out of darkness into hie marvellous
light: which in time past were not a
people, but are now the people of God:
which bad not obtained mercy, but
. now have obtained mercy," I Pet. ii.
9, I0; also Hos. i. ii. Let us, in con-
nection with tllis subject, remember
the words of the Lord to the ruler of
tho Jewa: "Marvel not that I said
unto thee, ye must be bom again."

V. THE PRINCE Oi' PEACE.
J&a. nxm. 23-26.
JEBUB ie Prince of the kings of the
earth; He is the Head of his body
the church, which is to be given to eit
with Him on hie throne. This body
is chiefty to be of the two families of
Joseph.
Some may be apt to say, that, seeing
the blessing can only be bad in Christ,
and that all who are in Christ are heirs
of the blessing, then the promise with
regard to the natural seed is super-
seded, by that with regard to the spi-
ritual seed, and is no more to be re-
garded. Not so. God's wondroua
working with regard to the natural
descendants of the fathers, in order to
make them the children of promise,
and 11000mplish the intents of his
heart with regard to them, will be
found one of the moat powerful testi-
monies to that truth, through the re-
ception of which they are regenerated
after the image of JesuL The pro-
phetic word, with regard to the two
families who were chosen to be typte
of blessing, Gen. xlviii. 20, is not to
be laid aside. Its fulfilment will yet
astonish the world; and prove a most
conclusive argumentin behalfofChris-
tianity. We are now to see that we
have the prophetic word confirmed
with regard to the natural seed, as 00.
fore we had, with regard to the spiri-
tual. The people can only be blessed
in Christ; but it was promised that
upecially the two families of Joseph
would be blessed in Him. The birth-
right was given to them. The Chief
Ruler was to come of Judah; but still
the birthright was Joseph's. In his
posterity, as submitting to Christ, the
blessings of multiplicity, supplanting
power, and means of blessing all n&-
tiona, weN to be realized, u already
tmly ao remarkably are in our people,
spread out unto all the nations of the
earth, with unprecedented facilities,
natural and artificial, for receiving and
communicating good. The Jews had
little conception of what was to hap-
pen to these two families, when they
saw them driven from their homee by
the AuyrianL .Aa little did tmly
think that Jeeua whom they after-
warda crucified, and of whom they
said, " His blood be upon us, and upon
our children," would, aa becoming the
acknowledged Head of that outcaR
pecple, procure for them all bleuing
which had been promiled, and from
which they appeared to be for everre-
moved, as beinjJ !oat among the Gen-
tiles.
" Moreover the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah, aaying, Conaidereet
thou not; what this people have spoken,
aaying, The two families which the
Lord bah chosen, he hath eTen cast
them off." It is to be recollected that
" tllu p«~pk," the pecple that were
near to the prophet, and whoee worda
he bad an opportunity of hearing
and considering, were the Jewa, tiM!
inhabitants of Jeruaalem, whose wol'da
the Lord reports alao to Ezekiel, cb.
xi., when he calls to that prophet'a
remembrance the outcast bonae of Is-
rael, saying, 'ftl'. 15, " Son of man, thy
brethren, thy brethren, the men of
thy kindred, and all tM house of Is-
rael wholly, they unto whom the in-
habitants of Jerusalem have Mid, ~
you far from the Lord: Unto 1lB is
this land given in poiiBellion." A

referred to in the text, Jer. ZDiii. 24;
but independent of ~he fact that the
twofamilieaofJoeephwereindeedthose
that the Lord chose to inherit the·
birthright, 1 Chron. v. 1, 2 j Gen.
xlviii. 13-20 j xlix. 22-26, it is
altogether incongruous, and contrary
to fact, to sa.y that the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, here called " this people,"
rejoiced in the expulsion of the reign-
ing family and of the Levites a~ that
time; but it is clear they had done so,
with regard to the two choen families,
Ephraim and Manasseh-the two fa-
milies of which the Lord had pur-
posed to make a great people, and a ·
multitude, or fulnesa, of nations. In-
deed, with regard to the whole house
of Israel, it is clear, from what is
stated, Ezek. xi. 15, thatitcouldmon
knly be laid of the Jews, the inhabi-
tants of Jerusalem, " Thus they have
despised my people, that they should
be no more a nation before them."-
So, however, it was not to be with the
Lord: they were never to oease from
being a nation before Him for ever,
although to the eye of man they
would have coosed to be a people.
Thus spake the Lord, of the out-
cast house of Israel, as distinguished
from the Jews, Ezek. xi. 16, "Al-
though I havecast them far oft' among
the heathen, and although I have
scattered them among the countries,
yet will I be to them as a little Sanc-
tuary in the countries where they
shall come." When yet out of the
land, and when having come into
other countries than those into which
they were taken by the Assyrians,
in place of beiug put far from the
Lord, they were to be received into
Him as their sure and all-sufficient
Refuge: which he can only be to
them in the Son of David; who also
was nijected of the Jews, but ap.
pointed to be Ruler in Israel. The
outcast children of Joseph have re-
ceived Him as the Crucified One; and,
through Him, have they, eTen already,
been lifted into power and blessing, ~
May they have the mind of thei~:
Prince-of Him who made Himself of
no reputation,who took upon Him the
form of a servant, and became obe-
dient unto death,even the death ofthe
cross. See Phil. ii. 11-15. So will
they follow after the things that make
for peace, and experience the truth of
the promitoe, Is. ix. 7. " Of the In-
crease of hie government and peace-
no end; upon the throneof David, and
upon Hie kingdom, to order it, and to
establishit,"&o. .AaJoseph Wllll made a
shepherd to hisfather's,house in Egypt,
so have the two families of Joseph,
which the Lord eapecially chose to be
brought into blessing in Christ-so
have the;r been given the power of
blessing, m the countriea where they
have come. .Aa conspicuous have they
been in the political and religious
world, as the heavenly bodies are in
the natural; and as sure has the word
been fulfilled with regard to them in
the appointed season. The word of
the Lord is tried, and it is indeed
found a true word: "Thus saith the
Lord, Ifmy covenant be not with day
and night, and if I have not appointed
the ordinances of heaven and earth,
then will I cast away the seed of Ja-·
cob, and David my servant; that I
will not take of his seed to be rnlera
over the seed of .Abraham, Isaac, aad
Jacob." .And this shall be eapecially
manifeated in the Restoration,when the
governors of Judah, spoken of Zech.
xii., will be found to be of the very
people whom the Jews supposed to be
made" not a people;" the very people
upon whom the Lord seemed not to
have mercy, but utterly to take away,
whilst he had mercy upon the bonae
of Judah. But now they that were
cast far off, are made nigh by the
blood of Jeaus. .And this was not only
to take place, as it has been doing,
out of the Land; but it will be fully
manifeated in the Land. The Lord
will accomplish his word, when we
are prepared for the promised blessing;
and when He is inquired of by the
house of Israel to do it for them.
" For I will cause their captivity to
return, and have mercy on them."
.And thereafter, even during the full

regard to the children of promise. The
Bride who will be given to sit with
the King upon the throne of his glory,
and who shall be given the dominion
over the whole earth, under the whole
heaven, will be found chiefly to have
come of the two families that the Lord
did choose, as truly as the Bridegroom
hath come of Judah. It will not be
a mere Gentile Church ruling over the
Lord's chosen nation, but it will be
found that the very people He chose
for his name, have had his name put
upon them. Soon may the Bride,
indeed, mnke herself ready; and be
found in the place which the Lord did
choose to place his Name there. Soon
may He there, and thence be pro-
claimed King of Salem, by the people
of whom He can most truly say, "I
have chosen thee, and not cast thee
away." Already hath He been exer-
cising, with regard to them, his kingly
power, making of them princes in all
the earth. He hath been causing them
to inherit the Gentiles, out among
whom they were cast, and for whose
case they may well be expected to
feel. Having been themselves Gen-
tiles so long, they may trnly sympa-
thise with the Gentiles. Soon the
God of their fathers will, through
them, cause the desolate places of Je-
rnaalem to be inhabited: when it will
be their part to seek and obtain mercy
for the Jew, who rejected Him who
alone could save them; and in whom
the fatherless have found salvation,
both temporal and spiritual-Through

The Blessing can only be found
as taking refuge in the ark of the
covenant-under the mercy seat-
sprinkled with the peace-speaking
blood of Jesus. He is our peace-
Melchizcdek, King of Righteouane88;
and after that King of Salem, which
is King of Peace. And it was written,
and is being fulfilled, " Let the Bless-
ing come upon the Head of Joseph,

THE mystery of God, which was to
be finished iu the da~ ofthe voice of
the seventh Mgel, when he shall be-

portant working of God, which would
be ripe fur dioclo~ure in the lllSt day~,
after the sixth trulllpct hns souud~d,
and when the seventh begius to sound.
It is not, however, anything entirely
newt that is revealed, but rather it is
the opening up of that which wu gh·en
forth of old," As Uu hath (!ecln.red unto
his!'ervantstheprophets."' R~v.x. l-· 7.
The mystery to be disclo~cd upon
the openin& of the book is very clearly
intinmtcd by the prophet Isuia '•
ch. xxix. It was to be but a ,·ety
little while bcfut·e Lebanon •honld be

the curse should be tukeu ft·om the

deaf would hear the words of the book.
The God of Israel is found a cove-
uant-keeping God. Not another peo-
ple iu their place, whether Jews or
Gentiles, but the very children of
promise that were lost havo been
found. - The manifestation of the
sons of God bas taken plsce, ver.

when he seetb his children, the work
of my hands, in the midst of him, they
shall sanctify my name, o.ud sanctify
the Holy One of Jacob, and shall
fear the God of Israel : "
The preceding part also of Is. xxix.
is remarkably connected with our
subject The woful case, to which
the city where Dllvid dwelt, would be
subjected, is described. TheA88yrians
enc.IIDped against it round about:
they were allowed to proceed DO fur-
ther. The Babylonians were per-
mitted to lay siege against her with a
mount, and they prevniled, to the tak-
ing the city, and the removing there-
from the "trength and beauty of the
Jewish people. But this did not end
their suffedngs: After the seventy
years' captivity, their enemies were
powerful round about-yea, theworda
were litera!ly fu'filled in the city her-
self, "And l will raise forts llj..'lliDst
thee" And at length, by the power
of the JWml\11>1 the threatening Willi
accomplished, " And thou shalt be
brotqht down:" nud •ince then the
predictions re.<P<"Ctiug the deep dogra.-
d.Ltion of .Jerusalem luwe b~eu abund-
antly verified. And thou • shalt speak
out of the ground, nud thy speech
shall be low out of the dust, and
thy voice shall be 118 of one that
hnth a familiar spirit, out of the
ground, and th.v speech shall whisper
out of the dust." The degrading
mumm~ry of the Holy Sepulchre
seems here alluded to. When the in.
habitants of Jerusalem bad thna de-
based Christianity, the city fell into
the hands of the Saracens, the chil-
dren of Hagar, the stranger, of whom
it is said, " Moreover the multitude of
thystrangers shall be like small dnat."
The beating of them to small dust,
might, in ps.rt, be accomplished by the
Crusaders; but these did not retain
the power. Next came the Turks-
" The multitude of the terrible ones,"
and they" shall beasohaff that puseth
away-yea, it shall be at an instant,
suddenly." The Lord will cleanse
Jerusalem. "Thou shalt be visited
of the Lord of Hosts with thunder,
and with earthquake, and great noise,

II cleansed, then aball abe be defended
-yea, already have all those nations
who have burdened themselves with
her been cut in pieces; and so most
signally will it be with regard to the
last great invasion, which is yet to
take place: " And the multitude of all
the nation& that fight against Ariel,
enn all that fight against her, and
her munition, and that distress her,
aball be aa a dream of a night vision."
But it is not alone the avowed ene-
miee of Zion that have been dream-
ing. Her own children have been as in a
ltllpor. They stumble on in the dark,
unmindful of his words, and so it fol-
lows," Stay yourselves, and wonder;
cryyeout, and cryl-Theyare drunk-
en, but not with wine; They stagger,
but not with strong drink.~ The rea-
lOU is alleged-" For the Lord hath
poured out upon you the spirit of deep
aleep, and hath <~losed your eyes.-
The prophets, and the rulers, the
eeen hatb he covered; and THE VI-
BIOJJ OF ALL is become unto you as
the worde of a book that ie sealed."
The First Vision spoken of as
such in the Bible, G1ln. xv., con-
tains a view ofthe whole course of di-
vine providence with regard to Abra-
ham'• posterity, and that both, as to
judgment and mercy, especially with
respect to that portion of them which
waa afterwards spoken of as ALL Is-
rael. But if we are come to the time
for opening the Book,then are we also
come to the time when the Vision
abould speak. It waa "the Vision of
all," which waa become aa the words
of a Book that is eealed.
Let ua hear the words addressed to
our father Abraham. We can only be
blel8ed along with that father of the
faithful, who, aa we are here told, " be-
lieved God, and It was counted to him
for rigbteousne111." Now it was not
written for his aake alone that it was
imputed to him, but for us also, to
whom it shall be imputed, if we be-
lieve on Him that raised up Jesus our
Lord from the dead."
"After these things the word of the
Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
aaying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy
ehield, and thy exceeding great re-
ward." Let us connect with these
words the declaration of our great
High Priest and Apostle, Christ Je-
su.s, Rev. i. 17, 18, "Fear not, I am
the first and tbe last." It is worthy
of remark, that He who was presented
to Abram as the object of his faith in
the first recorded vision of the Bible,
is the same who was presented to
John in the list great vision, with
which the sacred volume ends. And
what He is, bath done, and ever will
be, aa our Shield, is also declared-
" I am He that liveth, and waa dead;
and behold, I am alive for evermore."
He hath life in Himself, He died for
our sins, He rose again for our justi-
fication, and He ever livetl! to make
interceSBion for us. And, as our ex-
ceeding great Reward, He is theAKBJJ,
and hatl! " the keys of hell and of
death." It is through his giving the
Amen to tl!e supplications of his
saints, that they know God to be the
rewarder of them that diligently seek
him. And He will Himself be pre-
sented as the great AllEN to the ear-
nest cry of his waiting people, " Come,
Lord Jesus, come quickly."-Then
will God give reward unto his ser-
vants, the prophets; and to them
that fear him, small and great.
Abram longed after that, which it
was in the purpose of God to give him;
a seed who should inherit the bles&-
ing along with him; "And Abram
said, Lord God, what wilt thou give
me, seeing I go childless, and the stew-
ard of my house is this Eliezer of
Damascus?" He longed for the sign
of the fulfilment of the promise al-
ready given, ch. xii. 7, with regard to
a seed who should inherit tl!e land.
"And Abram said, Behold, to me
thou hast given no seed: and, loI one
born in my bouse is mine heir." God
condescended to assure him that it
was not a mere adopted posterity who
should inherit the promises; " And be-
bold the word of the Lord unto him,
saying, This shall not be thine heir;
but be that shall come forth of tl!ine

surely the birth of Isaac, in the cir-

cumstaneee, was the assured pledge or
sign, to Abram, that all else would be
accomplished according to the word
of the Lord. This was an a.ssuranoe
thnt through the One Seed, Christ,
already promised, a numerous pos-
terity would at length be brought
forth to him, to inherit, with him. the
promised blessing. These are they,
who, being in the present dispensa-
tion employed in turning many to
righteousne88, shall, in the period of
reward, shine a.s the stars for ever and
ever. And so it here follows, ver. 5,
" And he brought him forth abroad,
and said, Look now toward heaven,
and tell the stars, if thou be able to
number them: And he said unto him,
So shall thy seed be." And as an
example to the numerous seed who
thus will be lifted up, first in grace,
and then in glory, it is declared,
with regard to Abram, unto whom the
Lord had been presented as his shield,
and as his exceeding great reward,-
" And he believed in the Lord, and He
counted it to him for righteousness "
The Lord recognises not only the
truth of the promise respecting the
Seed, but also respecting the Land.
The Lord had not taken from Abram
the lesser gift, because he had given
him the greater, ver. 7, "And He said
unto him, I am the Lord that brought
thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to
give thee this land to inherit it."
Abram was not so indifferent with re-
gard to the land as many of his des-
oendants have been; and, that he
might be in no doubt as to what had
been spoken,he even asked a sign, ver.
8: " And he said, Lord God, whereby
shall I know thllt I shall inherit it? "
The sign which wu given to him ap-
pears to have been also a sign for us.
To him was presented the symbol, the
mystery of which h!I.B been accom-
plished in his descendants. They have
been in the gr088 darkness which fell
upon Abram, so that they have not
~een afar off: but when they see, they
shall find that our God hath not been
negligent as to the giving evidence of
his intention to fulfil his word, ver. 9,
".And he eaid, Take me an heifer of
three years old, and a she-goat of
three years old, and a ram of three
years old, and a turtle dove, and a
young pigeon: And he took unto hitn
all these, and divided them in the
midst, and laid each piece one againat
another; but the birds divided he not.
And when the fowls came down upon
thecarcases,Abram drove them away."
They have never effectually, until onr
own d•y, heen frayed away from prey-
ing upon the tom carcass of Judah.
The Jews, therefore, do not seem to
be the people referred to by these di-
vided carcases.
For the divisions of Reuben, the na-
tural first-born ofJacob, there were to
be great searchings of heart. TheLord
sent a word into Jacob, and it hl\th
lighted upon Israel. " The word
of God is quick and powerful, and
sharper than any two-edged sword,
piercingeven to thedividing usunder of
soul and spirit, and of the joints and
ml\rrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart.
Neither isthereanycreaturethat isnot
manifest in his sight: but all things are
nakedandopened unto the eyesofHim
with whom we have to do." It is to
be recollected, that the epistle from
which these words are quoted, is ad-
dressed to the Hebrews; and it is to
be observed that, whilst it is admitted·
that every creature is naked and open
before the eyes of Omniscience, yet
the dividing of the earcases had a spe-
cial reference to the Hebrews, the
descendants of Abraham, unto whom
the word of the Lord was sent, and
upon whom it was to light.
The seed of Jacob, more especially
of the house of Israel (not Judah) ap-
pear to be the people represented by
these carcases, which, although di-
vided, were not to be given as a prey
to the fowls of heaven. It is to be
observed that the carcases were not
objects of hatred, but of tender con-
cern to Abraham. His posterity, with
regard to whom he had expressed so
deep an interest in the preceding part
of the chapter, were indeed divided, ac-
cording to the word of' the Lord, and
that especially through the instrumen-

ta1ity of the Ass,ri&ns, who were a'!·
lowed to take or drive them away m
two, or, as some have supposed, in
three great captivities. Of those that
were led away captive, many appear
to have l!ettled along the borders of
the Black Sea, th" banks of the Da-
nube, and the north-westem parts of
Europe; whilst of those that escaped,
as fleeing by the ships.of Tyre, &c.
from the coast of Palestine down the
Mediterrane!lll, there l!eem to have
been settlements formed over against
them, along the northern borders of
that sea, and in these isles afar off.
Israel were ·divided and subdi-
vided thus, as to the great body of
them: "But the bird~ divided he
not." And it is remarkable, that in
Ie. xi. 6, 7, when the young of'
these tame animals, the he1fer, the
abe-goat, and the ram, are spoken of,
aa being gathered into thf' sanctuary
along with the previously wild ani-
mals, no mention is made of the
turtle dove or young pigeon.
"The wolf," by which waa repre-
eented the fourth or Roman empire,
"shall dwell with the Jamb," the
young of the last of the animals di-
vided by Abram. "And the leopard,"
which was used to reprerent the Gre-
ciBn empire, "shall lie down with the
kid," the young ofthe she-goat. The
enlf, the young of the heifer, is then
adverted to, "And the calf and the
young lion, and the fBtling together;
and a little child shall leBd them"-
The same tame animal in another
stage of existence, is spoken of in con-
nection with Persi~, represented by
the bear, when it is said," The cow
and the bear shall feed ; their young
ones shall lie down together." The
same kind of animal, as not only full
grown, but powerful and •trong for
labour, is •voken of as having assimi-
lated to it the lion, which repre-
sent<·d the Babylonian empire: "And
the lion shall eat straw like the ox."
And then, as if alluding to the Cas-
piBn Sea, which bounded A..yria
northward, " The sucking child •hall
piBy on the hole of the Bl'p;" and,
lastly, as turning to Egypt, "The
weaned ohild shall put his hand on
the cocltatriee den." "They," the
Egyptian and Aasyrian, "shall not
burt," nor shall the Babylonian lion,
nor the Persian bear. nor the GJ'(?cian
leopard, nor the Roman wolf, "destroy
in all my holy mouutain." Their evil
n11ture will have been taken away, by
the knowledge ofthe Lord. "For the
earth," or land, " sh111l be full of the.
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea." The sanctuary will
have been cleansed, and as into the
ark of Noah the diflerent animals, na-
turally opposed to each·other, Rssem-
bled peaceably, so into his prep"red
place will the Lord assemble many
out ofthe nations adverted to, as being
joined unto his people of Isr11el. " And
in that day there shall be 11 root of
Jesse, which shall stand for au en~ign
of the Jl!l<lple; to it shnll the Gentiles
seek, and his rest shall be glory."
Previous to this glory being made
manifest, there was, however, to be a
period o( great darkues,, not only to
the l11nd, but upon the people. This
is adverted to Is·.iah lx., where the
call is given to Zion. " Arise, shine,
for thy light is come, and the glory of
the Lord is risen upon thee." It is
added, "For, behold, darkne~s shall
cover the earth or land, and groas
darkness the people; but the Lord
shall arise upon thee, and his glory
sh11ll be seen upon thee. Anti the Gen-
tiles shall come to thy light, and kings
to the brightness of thy rising."
Ephraim is represented by the dove
immediately before their departure
from the land, Hos. vii 11, " Ephraim
also is like a silly dove without heart.
They call to Egypt; tJ.ey go toAssyria.
When they shall go, I will spread my
net upon them · I will bring them
down as the fowls of the htaven; I
will cl1a.•tise them a~ their conJ!regn-
tion hath hoord." But though, at
thnt time, sorely reduced, the~· will
return in beauty and with ble•sing, as
is promised, Ps. lxviii. IS, "Though
ye ha,·e lain among the pots-the
wings of a dove covered ·with silver,
ant! her feathers with yellow gold I"
And aecordingly, when the question

is aaked, Ia. Ix. 8, " Who are theee
that !l.y as a cloud, and as the doves
to their windowa?'' It is anawered, ver.
9, " Surely the isles aha!! wait for me,
and the ships of Tarshish first, to
bring thy eons from far, their silver
and their gold with them, unto the
name ofthe Lord thy God, and to the
Holy One of Iarael." Then, when the
voice of the turtle shall be heard in
the laud, will the sign be given of
fast approaching blessin~.
A long deep sleep, and fearful dark-
nesa, were, however, to precede thia
gladsome breaking of the light; the
sign of which myatery fell 11pon
Abram; and it has been fulfilled even
in his believing children, as is evident
by their almoat atudied inattention to
the word of prophecy, unto which we
do well that we take heed, as unto a
light that shineth in a dark place.-
How fearful bas been the darknesa
that has for many agea hung over
the case of the pecple of promire, and
over God's greut working in provi-
dence with regard to them I Truly
the prophet&, as looking forward to the
long dreary time of Israel's hiding,
might well exclaim, " Who hath be-
lieved our report? and to whom ia the
arm of the Lord revealect?" So dark
it was that they knew not even the
Son of God, the long-expected Mes-
siah, when he appeared, in the very
place and time appointed from the
days of old. In Abram was this case
of his descendants shadowed forth,
ver. 12, " And when the sun was go-
ing down, a deep sleep fell upon
Abnun: And,lo! an horror of greRt
darkness fell upon him :" This was
fuUilled in the spirit of deep sleep, and
that covering of the seers and the
prophet&referred to, Is. Xltix. 10.
The dark and deeply distressed
state of Iarael in Egypt; their deliver-
ance therefrom, under the hand of Mo-
ses; their espou"al to the Lord in
the wilderness; and their entrance
into the land, under the Captain of the
Lord's host, apoke of greater things
which were, and, in part, are yet .to
come. " And he said unto Abram,
Know of a 1urety, that thy seed shall
be a stranger in a land that Ia not
theirs, and shall serve them, and they
shall afBict them four hundred yean,
and also that nation whom they shall
serve will I judge: And afterward•
ahRII they come out with great sub-
stance." And the pledge that thia
would be was also giveo,. to his imme-
diate descendants, ver.15, "And thou
aha!~ go to thy fathers in peace; thou
shalt be buried in a good old age.''-
Then, referring to the deliverance from
the Egyptianbondage,itfollows, ver.l6,
" But in the fourth generation they
shall come hither again, for the ini·
quity of the Amorit<ls is not yet full."
And then, going forward to the period
following their expulsion from the
land, represented by the divided car-
cases, deep sl~ep, and horror of great
darkness, it follows, with regard to the
ministration ofjudgment and ofmercy,
going forth from Jerusalem, in the
case of the Jews, ver. 17, "And it
came to pasa, that when the sun. went
down, and it was dark, behold, a
smoking furnace, and a burning lamp,
that passed between those pieces.''-
Now, these we are told, Is. xxxi. 9,
were in ·Jerusalem. The Assyrian,
who had been the instrument of sepa-
rating the carcaaes of Israel, was not.
allowed to accomplish the same with
regard to Judah. The Lord had a
further purpose to serve with regard
to the Jews. And so the word waa
fulfilled, " And be shall pass over to
his strong hold for fear, and his prince&
shall be afmid of the ensign, saith the
Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and hia
furnace in Jerusalem." But when the
Jews had filled up the measure of
their iniquity in the laud, then
was the word of God, which is a
light to our feet, an•l a lamp to
our path, sent, in miuistrntion, away
from Jerusal~m, down through .Asia
Minor, Greece, and Rome, in the
midst of the divided carca.set~, the ex-
patriated and scattered children of
Israel. Then was the Great High
Priest, who had been rejected in Jeru-
salem, found in the midst of the seven
golden can-iiesticks, as rem-Jved to the
eities of Agia Minor. There, iu the

ministration of the word, did John
behold Him, whose eyes are as a flame
of fire, and who aearoheth the reins
and the heart. It was to search out,
and consume the heart-wickedness
of his people, by that which truly
maketh manifest, that Israel had been
parted, and .placed thus along the
great line, in which hath come the
ministration of the word.. The word
was thus ministered by believing Jews,
such as Paul, from Jerusalem, round
about unto Illyricum. It was by the
lamp of fire from Jerusalem, supplied
with oil by our great superintending
High Priest, that meroy hath visited
us, who sat in darkness, "to guide our
feet into the way of peace."
The ministration ofjudgment hath
also thus come; as truly bath been
fulfilled, in the unbelieving Jews, the
figure of the smoking furnace, as in
the believing Jews, who were made
light in the Lord, was displayed the
burning lamp. The Romans, who
laid Jerusalem waste, and who led the
Jews away captive in their last great
captivity, drew them down north-
westward, in the Mme direction as
had come tbe ministration ofthe word
of life. They have been an exemplifi-
cation of the curse upon those who re-
ject Him in whom alone blessing can
be found. To the truth of the Gos-
pel, the case of unbelieving Judah has
been a constant and loudly attesting
witneu. 8jl8 as to the uses which this
remnant from Jerusalem was to serve
unto the outcasts of Iarael, Ezek. xiv.
22,23.
Nor in the Jews alone have these
witnesses been made to appear, but
the case of every people, uot only
from Jerusalem, round about to llly-
ricum, but even straight onward in the
direction of our own island, has been
made to witness to the truthfulness
of God, either in mercy or in judg-
ment. Nor will the witness here ter-
minate-nay, hence it will, and has,
')? 71.~
in a measure, spread unto the utter-
most parts of the earth; and not only
will the witness thus spread, but
thence it will come together into
unity and strength, when in that
land, which hath so long lain desolate
without them, which dftrkness hath co-
vered, whilst gross darkness was cover..;
ing the people, the children of promise
shall, in the light, "be lifted up like
the stones of a crown, as an ensign
upon his land." Then the Lord will
accomplish his covenant mercy of
wbioh he spake to Abraham, saying,
" Unto thy seed have I given this
land, from the river of Egypt unto the
great river Euphrates." The country,
then inhabited by "the Kenite's, the
Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, and
the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and
the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and
the Canaanites, and the Girgashites,
and the Jebusites,~ is now empty for
returning Israel. As truly as they
have multiplied in the ends of the
earth, has their own central-land been
made empty for them; And they that
are Jell; of the nations aro11nd shall yet
aa.y, " This land that was desolate is
become like the garden of Eden, and
the waste, and desolate, and mined
cities, are become fenced, and are in-
habited. Then the heathen that are
left; round about you, shall know that
I, the Lord, build the mined places,
and plant that that was desolate: I,
the Lord, have spoken it, and I will
do it." Yes, there shall yet come the
voice from the throne, saying, It is
done. The mystery of God is finished.
The 'face of the covering which was
cast over all nations is destroyed-
" The glory of the Lord shall be re-
vealed, and all flesh shall see toge-
ther." Now will have come the ma-
nifestation of the sons of God, and
now, in truth, will be the waiting for
God's Son from heaven, and the great
proclamation of the Gospel of the
Kingdom.
