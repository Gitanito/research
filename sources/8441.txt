  Sharp, Kimberly Clark   (1995).&nbsp; After the Light&nbsp; What I Discovered on the Other Side of Life That Can   Change Your World.&nbsp; New York, NY:&nbsp; William Morrow and Company, Inc.

Sample    This   sample encompasses one woman from Kansas that had a near-death experience that   changed her life.

  Methodology    Ms. Sharp   uses self-report to describe her near-death experience and the way if affected   her life.

  Abstract

Ms. Clark had a   near-death experience during her adult life that changed everything.&nbsp; She was   walking down a sidewalk and suddenly her heart stopped.&nbsp; Luckily for her, a   nurse just happened to be near-by.&nbsp; The nurse resuscitated her and got medical   help for Ms. Clark.&nbsp; During the time that she was clinically death, Ms. Clark   had an extraordinary near-death experience that lead her whole life in another   direction.&nbsp; She realized that her life before had no purpose and that she needed   to do for others in order to live a fulfilling existence.&nbsp; As a direct result of   what happened to her, she became a social worker and a counselor.&nbsp; She counsels   people who have had near-death experiences.&nbsp; She also has psychic abilities that   she credits directly with the properties of the near-death experience.    In   addition to all of the personal effects of the near-death experience, Ms. Clark   has also had professional triumphs.&nbsp; She has developed educational materials for   medical professionals who deal with people who have near-death experiences.&nbsp; She   describes in detail some of the patients she personally has encountered and how   they have dealt with the after math of their near-death experience.

  Important Concepts and Definitions    Near Death   Experience ' an experience where the person has a clinical death and is   resuscitated.&nbsp; The experience happens between the time that the body shuts down   and the person is resuscitated.

  Operationalizations    This   account of a near death experience is qualitative in nature.&nbsp; It is a   self-report of a near-death experience encountered by the author.

  Major Findings

Near-death   experiences involve the family in multiple ways, but it seems that near-death   survivors encounter family members who are deceased during the near-death   experience and then of course, there's the family members living that must be   dealt with after the near-death experience.&nbsp; As part of the near-death   experience, when deceased family members are encountered and then the   experiencer has to leave them behind when resuscitation occurs, there is an   effect on the experiencer.&nbsp; Some people reported that they were angry that they   had to leave these family members behind.&nbsp; They felt that the reason for their   resuscitation and having to leave the after-life behind was a result of the   deceased family member's vindictiveness. They often carry these feelings with   them for many years.&nbsp; These feelings alone can make the person talking with a   trained professional obligatory.&nbsp; Another person that had seen deceased family   members during their near-death experience reported a reaction to leaving the   deceased family member as depression.&nbsp; The near-death experiencer would have   preferred to stay in the after-life.&nbsp; When they were resuscitated, not only did   they miss the environment of the after-life, but they missed the companionship   of the deceased relative.&nbsp; If the depression persists, then treatment should be   sought.

Families dealing with   people who have experienced near-death need to be prepared for the initial   changes that are commonly associated with this phenomena.&nbsp; Ms. Clark feels that   educating families is the key for adjusting to the changed near-death   experiencer.&nbsp; Ms. Clark described one woman who, when she came out of her   experience wanted to give all of her possessions away to the poor.&nbsp; Her family   and she had to encourage the lady to wait until everything had stabilized in her   life before making decisions of such magnitude.&nbsp; After adjusting to her   situation, the woman did change her mind about giving all of her possessions   away.&nbsp; In this way, the family and the woman were educated about the best way to   deal with the adjustment period that happens immediately following a near-death   experience.&nbsp; Ms. Clark also describes the anger that patients sometimes feel   directly after a near-death experience.&nbsp; They are angry because they feel that   they were 'kicked out' of a place that they wanted to stay.&nbsp; The family members   have to let the person be angry, vent, and then, as in one case she presents,   read everything they can on near-death experiences so that they can support and   understand the experiencer when they are ready to talk.

Near-death   experiences are not always pleasant.&nbsp; Some people have experiences that they   describe as 'hellish'.&nbsp; These people often respond to the experience by making   drastic changes in their lives.&nbsp; Ms. Clark describes two people who had these   experiences.&nbsp; Both of them changed their lives totally around and became   ministers.&nbsp; Sometimes family members are able to adapt to the life changes that   these experiences necessitate and sometimes they are not.&nbsp; Near-death   experiences can break up families.    Overall,   it is to be expected that the drama associated with a near-death experience will   not just touch the life of the experiencer.&nbsp; Family members must be prepared for   the changes that happen when a family member goes through such a traumatic   experience as near-death.&nbsp; They must be prepared to seek help for themselves and   the experiencer and look for signs that this is necessary. </body>
