  		              		Experience Description   

    I had  covid, was experiencing congestive heart failure, and was very ill. I live alone and  had no one to help take care of me. I had talked to my doctor who was treating me  and he said as sick as I was, I was going to need oxygen that night. I had fluid retention of ten pounds over night and I seriously felt like I was dying.  As the day went on, I became sicker and called a few people to try and get someone to take me to the hospital but I couldn't get any one to do so.  I think everyone was afraid to get Covid from  me. I was too sick to drive myself. I willed myself to go upstairs and get in a hot bath to try and help relieve the pain I was having. I had to tell myself to lift my foot up with every step that I took up the stairs. I finally made it up stairs and got into a hot bath and  eventuality fell asleep. I woke myself up because I was snoring. I got out of the bath and made my way into my bed room. I checked my  O2 level and it was  87. I was having a hard time breathing. I was so sick that I remember thinking so what if I die and  I just laid on my bed and fell asleep. 

  Then I was floating up against  the  ceiling and looking down  at my body on the bed. I felt totally at peace and  had no thoughts of anyone. I could see my body and my dogs lying next to me, but I had no connection  with them. Nor did I have any thoughts at all about my family,  kids, or  friends. It was like I was just looking at my body and my pets and felt nothing for anyone.  I was totally at peace and felt the happiest I have ever felt. The peace and happiness was so profound  that I can't explain it in words. 

  I became aware of my fiance,  who had passed away 7 years ago. He was to the left of me up against my shoulder by my head.  He had the most loving smile on his face. I was so happy that I was with him and we were communicating.   I am not sure we were physically speaking; it was more like we just knew what we were saying to each other. He said,  'You  know you can't stay, right?' I responded back, 'What??'  and was  feeling upset. He answered,  'Yes you  have to go back.' I told him 'WHAT you're not my boss you can't make me go back!' I felt  terrified and he was  just  smiling at me and the next thing  I know I was back in my body sitting up in the bed gasping for air and trying to breath. 

  I felt angry and yelled at God, 'Why did you make me come back? Why couldn’t I  stay? What did I do wrong? What do I still need to do that you sent me back?' I'm not sure how I made it through that night.  Nor am I sure if that experience was an out of body experience our if I stopped breathing. But I do know it was real and the experience gave me more assurance that there is more than this life. However, I was angry for a while and it took me time to get over the anger of having to come back.
