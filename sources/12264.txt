I was in a complete and utter void. Later, I remember being in the emergency room in the hospital and seeing myself from a third perspective. I could see them moving me from the gurney to the operating table. I could hear them saying, 'Don't leave us Simon. Don't leave us,' and them working frantically to resuscitate me.
