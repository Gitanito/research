FOREWORD
D
EAR READER, you are not only a reader but
a friend whom I have met face to face and
conversed with just as you have met and con­
versed with each of the characters in this book. I am
certain they know you and look upon you as a
close friend. They surround you with the full glory
of the Divine Light of Life, Love, and Wisdom; and
by surrounding you thus, they aid you in your un­
derstanding.
They enfold you in the ever-present Divine Light
of Life, Love, and Wisdom which is theirs to send
out and to give. They see you always enfolded in
this Omnipresent Divine Presence. They see you
seated on your own throne as a true king or queen,
ruling through and by this Divine Presence. They
envisage you knowing, and accomplishing your Di­
vine Mission, always alive, always peaceful and
happy, always the Divine You. They see not only
you, but the whole human family, divine and pure,
and every created thing or form as divine, created
in the image and likeness of the divine; not one,
nor one sect nor one creed, but all, and that all
inclusive.
None can appreciate these great people save those
who have been admitted to the quiet of their sacred
places and thoughts. They LIVE truth, which is
a part of the Universe itself. Life is really traceable
back into the misty past which bears to us the ac­
complishments of hundreds of thousands of past
centuries. To us, life is bound about by every limi­
tation and convention. To them, life is boundless,
ceaseless, unending bliss and happiness; the longer
the span of life, the greater the joy and the more
worth while the living.
None that understand and love these people can
doubt their teachings; neither can he doubt their
true sincerity when he has partaken of their hospi­
tality.
The western world looks to the outer, thereby
touching the hem of the garment. The eastern puts
on the robe, but not as a garment that may be laid
aside.
The West polish the vessel of the lamp. The East
fan the flame that it may give forth a more intense
light.
The West look to the outer with longing eyes,
back of which is the glow of spiritual vision, the
seeking of true knowledge. The East know that
flesh must be illuminated by the light of the flame,
that is first kindled from within, then allowed to
shine forth to the without, as the full blaze of the
noonday sun.
The West name themselves material. The East
live truly in the allness of spirit. They behold each
and every one living by compelling, impelling, sus­
taining Spirit,—it matter not what the location, be
it in the great snows of Alti Himalaya, the busy
modern city, or the most secluded monastery.
That which to the western world seems miracu­
lous and unbelieveable is to the poised Hindu
thought, the natural outcome of the acceptance and
the bringing forth of Spirit, that which is set forth
as God in manifest form. They that are fully alive,
know full well that there is far more than that
which comes under their personal recognizance; in
fact, there is much more than ever has been dream­
ed of in any philosophy.
Therefore there are no apologies offered for this
book or for those which have preceded it.
When you look longingly with a clear vision to­
ward an accomplishment, it is your divine heritage
to command that you place yourself in such a recep­
tive attitude that the ability is already yours, to
bring forth your ideal.
God speaks through the God-man today just as
God has spoken down the long ages. The knowledge
which the people in this book convey is by no means
new, although the presentation brings a new light
to the western world.
The main object of their lives is to give knowl­
edge and enlightenment to humanity through pure
knowledge, aflame with love. Their great mission is
to pave the way toward peace and harmony through
man’s great power to accomplish. They are the
greatest friends of true science, religion, and phi­
losophy; and they proclaim these as well as all men,
brothers, as Truth is one. Thus science becomes
the golden thread upon which the pearls are strung.
The day has already outgrown the old concept of
Divinity. They have lost their faith in teachings
based upon faith alone; they have learned that to
be good in order to gain a heavenly reward after
death, is a fallacy, a very low ideal,—this idea of
being good for the reward’s sake, and the special
privilege of playing harps and singing psalms for­
ever. They have realized that this is an expression
of self-interest only, and completely foreign to the
teachings of the Christ of God, the God-man fully
alive.
The idea of death is foreign to—in fact, it is a
direct contradiction of—the divine purpose and is
not in accord with the law of the Cosmos or its
vibrant radiations. Neither is it in accord with the
teachings of Jesus.
The church and the graveyard are often in the
same field. This alone is a direct acknowledgment
that Christian teachings have not been even com­
prehended. The Christ-man has spoken and the
listening ear has heard, “If a man believes in me,
he shall never die.” The God-man knows that the
one who is in sin or lives with sinful vibrations sur­
rounding him dies, and unto him “the wages of sin
is death”; but the gift of God to the God-man, is
eternal life—God made manifest to God-man in the
kingdom of God here on earth, the human body
perfect in the flesh, when man lives true to the God
vibration and wholly in that vibratory thought.
The people in this book have taken God out of
the realm of the supernatural and of superstition
and have placed Him wholly in vibratory frequency,
knowing that as they keep their bodies in the divine
vibration, they never grow old and never die.
When the vibrations of their bodies are lowered
or allowed to slow down, death ensues. In fact
these people know that when the mistake of death
is accomplished, the body is vibrating at such a low
rate that the emanating life-vibrations are actually
crowded out of the body temple, and that those vi-
bi’ating life-emanations still hold together and main­
tain the same form which the body had when they
were crowded out. Those emanations have intelli­
gence and still revolve around a central nucleus or
sun which attracts and holds them together. These
emanating particles are surrounded by an intelligent
emanation that assists them to keep their form, and
from which they again draw substance to erect
another temple. This is in direct accord and works
in complete harmony with the intelligence that has
been built around the body during their life cycle.
If that intelligence vibrates at a low frequency, or
in other words, is weak, it loses contact with the
emanations of life and energy that have been forced
out of the body (or form of clay after the life-
emanations have left it), and the emanations finally
disperse and return to the source, then complete
death is accomplished; but if the intelligence is
strong, vibrant, and active, it takes full charge im­
mediately and a new body is instantly assembled.
A resurrection has taken place; and through that
resurrection, man is perfected in the flesh. Not all
can hear or accept such a revelation. “He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear.” (Mark 4:9). He whose
understanding is developed sufficiently, is able to
comprehend.
Thus, large portions of humanity are developing
a science through which they are again discovering
that God has always lived in man, and with human­
ity; yet they for a time have not known God, they
have only lost sight of the God-man.
To those of whom 1 have written I dedicate this
book, as well as the books that have been published.
At the feet of these near and dear ones I lay my
deepest respect and gratitude, and in no way do I
feel that I am conferring upon them the honor due
them.
We went doubting; we left with the greatest re­
grets, loving them every one, feeling that we had
gained a truer and deeper insight into the science
of Life and True Living.

CHAPTER I
A FTER THOSE assembled had departed, my
r \ associates and I stayed on, loath to leave the
^ place where we had witnessed such a trans­
formation. No words can describe our feeling and
the tremendous uplift of those last hours.
The words, “ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL”
blazed forth as vividly as when they first appeared.
We did not talk, we could not say a word. Although
we were in the same general position until daylight,
we had no sense of being confined in a room. Our
bodies seemed to emit a brilliant light; and wher­
ever we walked we had no sense of limiting walls,
although just previous to the experience we were
in a room hewed from solid rock. There did not
seem to be a floor under our feet; yet we moved
freely in any direction.
Words absolutely fail to describe our thoughts
and sensations. We even walked beyond the con­
fines of the room and the cliff; yet we had no feel­
ing of being hampered. Our garments and every­
thing about us seemed to radiate a pure white light.
Even after sunrise this light seemed brighter than
that of the sun. We seemed to be in a great sphere of
light and we could look through this crystal ray and
see the sun as it appeared far away, shrouded in a
haze. It actually seemed cold and uninviting com­
pared with the place where we stood. Although the
thermometer registered 45 degrees below zero and
the country was covered with snow that sparkled in
the morning sunlight, in the place where we were
there was a consciousness of warmth, peace, and
beauty that surpasses expression. It was one occa­
sion in which thoughts could not be put into words.
Here we stayed for three more days and nights
[15]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
with no thought of rest or refreshment. There was
not a sign of fatigue or weariness, and as we looked
back upon the time it seemed as if it passed in an
instant. Yet we were conscious of each other’s
presence and of the passing of the hours.
There was no sunrise or sunset, just a continuous
glorious day; not a vague dream but every mo­
ment an actual reality. And what a vista of the fu­
ture opened before us! The horizon seemed to be
pushed back into eternity; or, as our Chief expressed
it, it seemed to be expanding into a boundless and
eternal sea of throbbing, pulsating life. And the
great beauty of it all was, that it was for all to see
and know—not for just a few, but for all.
On the fourth day, our Chief suggested that we
go below to the room of the records in order to
again take up our work of translation. Upon mak­
ing the move to proceed, we found ourselves stand­
ing all together in the room.
I can but let the reader picture our astonishment
and joy. We had moved two stories down and
accomplished two flights of stairs without the least
physical exertion on our part and without the least
knowledge of the accomplishment. Yet there we
were in the room among the records where we had
been working. It was all aglow with light, the place
was warm and cheerful, and we could move any­
where we wished without the least effort.
When we took up one of the tablets and placed
it in a convenient place for study, its context and
meaning were translated to us perfectly. When we
began writing these translated conclusions, suddenly
a whole page of manuscript would be filled with the
text in our own handwriting. All we need do, was
to place the pages together in manuscript form.
In this way we finished manuscript after manu­
script of these translations. By two o’clock that
[16]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
afternoon we had finished and filed twelve manu­
scripts of over four hundred pages each, and we
experienced not the least fatigue from this pleasant
occupation.
We were so engrossed that we were unconscious
of the presence of others in the room until our
Chief stepped forward with a greeting. We all look­
ed up to see Jesus, Emil, our hostess, and Chander
Sen—the man of the records, whom we had at
first called the old man of the records, but whom
we now knew as “the young man.” There were also
Bagget Irand and a stranger to whom we were in­
troduced as Ram Chan Rah. We later learned his
familiar name to be Bud Rah.
A table was cleared and prepared for a meal. We
sat down, and after a few moments of silence, Jesus
spoke:
“Almighty and All-Pervading Father Principle,
which shines forth ever triumphant from within us
out to all the world, and is the light, love and beauty
which we are experiencing this day and which we
always experience if we only will, we bow before
this altar on which burns the undying fire of perfect
love, harmony, true wisdom, unending devotion,
and pure humility. This sacred light shines steadily
on, undimmed, from within the souls of those that
are now gathered at this the altar of true father­
hood, sonship, and devoted brotherhood. This divine
light does shine forth from these near and dear ones,
out and out to the most remote places of all the
world, that all may see its great light and may ex­
perience its undimmed and unquenchable love. The
rays of this all-pervading light, beauty, and purity
shine through the receptive souls and hearts of those
who are gathered at this, your altar. We are now
conscious of these all-consuming and embracing
[17]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
rays of love, and we send them forth and they trans­
mute, blend, and harmonize all mankind.
“It is the true and the pure Christ of God standing
forth from each and all, that we salute and stand
face to face with, equal to—one with God.
“Again we salute God, our Father, right within
and standing forth.”
After Jesus ceased speaking, we all arose upon
the suggestion that we return to the room where our
former experience had taken place. As we started
toward the door, we realized that we were already
there.
This time we were conscious of moving, but not
conscious of the cause of locomotion. As soon as
we expressed the desire, we were actually in the
upper room. Although the shadows of evening were
well advanced, our wav was perfectly lighted and
we found all aglow with the rich beauty and efful­
gence that had been there when we departed.
The reader will recall it was in the room we had
just left that Chander Sen returned to us after being
brought back from what we looked upon as death.
To us that room was a shrine, and it seemed
aglow with all possibilities, a sanctified place where
we ourselves had been able to step forth to a greater
accomplishment than as mortals we had previously
known.
From that time on until April 15th, the day of our
departure, not a day or night passed that we did not
all meet together for at least one hour. During this
time the room never again assumed the appearance
of solid rock. It seemed as though we could always
see through those walls into infinite space. It was
in that room that the bonds limiting consciousness
were removed. It was there that a great vista of
the future opened to us. We all sat down at the
table and Jesus resumed the conversation.
[18]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
“It takes a true motivating thought, focused on
a central absorbing point or ideal to bring forth or
accomplish; and you, as well as all mankind, can
become that motivating center. Not one thing
comes form unless man first expresses the ideal.
“At one time man was fully conscious that he was
this motivating center, and lived fully conscious of
his inheritance and dominion. He lived consciously
in a condition that you term heaven. All but a few
have let go of this divine gift, and today the great
majority are absolutely unconscious of this divine
quality which is mankind’s true inheritance.
“What a man has done once, he can accomplish
again. This is the principle back of the endless
array of life and manifestation that you see all
around you, and includes your own life, together
with that of every existing thing, as every existing
thing has life. Ere long science will give you ample
grounds for saying that things are not material; as
science will soon see that all things can be reduced
to one primal element containing innumerable par­
ticles universally distributed, responding to vibra­
tory influences, and all in perfect and absolute
equilibrium or balance.
“Hence it follows on mathematical grounds alone
that it took some definite movement, some initial
action, to draw together the infinite particles of this
all-pervading universal neutral substance, in order
to bring them into form as selective objects.
“This power did not originate wholly within a
particle, but is a power greater, yet at one with the
particle; and you, through your thought and definite
action, co-operating with the vibration, give selec­
tivity to these particles. Thus will physical science
be compelled to understand through necessary de­
ductions, so that scientists will recognize the pres­
ence of a power, which, at this time, is not under­
l i e
stood because it is inactive; and which is inactive
only because it is not recognized.
“But when recognize and communed with by
man, and brought into actual expression, it is fully
capable of separating certain specific areas for the
specific display of this universal cosmic energy.
“Then there is built up what you look upon as a
material universe, with all its different manifesta­
tions, by an orderly process of evolution. If orderly,
then each stage must lay the foundation perfectly
for the greater development of the stage that is to
follow. If you can accomplish progress in perfect
order and harmony of thought and action, you are
in actual accord with power; and this power brings
forth, on an unlimited scale, the faculty of selecting
the means to an end. You distribute life and energy
under a recognized order of cosmic progression.
“This, then, is not a material universe as you
have thought; that is only your definition of it. It
came forth from spirit, and it is spiritual if you
will define it as such. This is orderly, true, basic.
If orderly, it is scientific; if scientific, it is intelli­
gent; it is life united with intelligent life.
“Life coupled to, and guided by intelligence, be­
comes volition; and through volition, it becomes
vocation.
“Spirit is the primary, vibrating, originating
power; and you may enter into spirit and use its
power by the simple acceptance or knowing that
it does exist; then let it come forth, and the whole
of spirit is at your command. To you it becomes
an ever-potent spring of perpetual and original life
right within yourself.
“This does not take long years of study, nor need
you go through training or hardships or depriva­
tion. Know and accept that this vibration does
exist; then let it flow through you.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[20]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
“You are one with Great Creative Mind Substance;
thus you know that all things do exist. If you will
but see that Divine Principle, Great Principle, Good
Principle, God Principle is all there is,—that it fills
all space, is all—then you are that principle; and
as you stand forth in your Christ Dominion and
give out this principle, you, by your very thought,
word, and act, give this principle greater activity.
Thus one more has found his dominion and is using
God Power and seeding it out. As you give out this
power, it flows to you. As you give, more is pressed
upon you to give, and you will find you cannot de­
plete the supply.
“This does not mean going into a closet and hid­
ing yourself. This is getting quiet right where you
are, even in the busy so-called turmoil of life, under
the most trying circumstances. Then life is not tur­
moil; it is quiet, contemplative, and compulsive.
“The outer activity is as nothing compared with
the greater activity that you now realize and are one
with. This is getting quiet right where you are,
seeing God standing forth from you,—closer than
breathing, nearer than hands and feet,—with your
whole thought action centered on God.
“Who is God? Where is the God that your whole
thought action is centered or focused upon?
“God is not a great being outside of you, that you
are going to bring within and then present to the
world. God is that power which is generated and
exhilarated by your own thought action. It is true
that this power is within and all about you, but it
is inactive until you think of it and know that it
does exist; then you see it flowing forth from you in
limitless measure. You present it to the world, and
the world is benefited by your presentation. You,
yourself must present the accomplishment by put­
ting forth the driving force of all Good, God your
[21]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
Father, the power to accomplish, behind every
thought and act. Now you are God fulfilling or
filling full the accomplishment. This is God, the
true and only God, standing forth from you.
“You are then God the Father, the husbandman,
the amplifier and the projector, the definite and
positive accomplisher. And it is then that legions
fly to do your bidding.
“The moment you say wholeheartedly, with rev­
erence and deep meaning, that God is in this Holy
Temple and know that this temple is your pure
body, just as you present it, and as you truly stand
today; that you, the true Christ, live one with God
right within his temple; and that your exalted body
is a holy abiding place; a whole and all-inclusive
abode; you are an energizer, an all-including and
outpouring vessel for this true and divine principle
to flow through. Then you pour out more and more
of the God which you are and which you love.
“You worship, you praise, and with your ever-
expanding love, you pour out to all mankind that
they may see the Christ, the God-man standing
forth triumphant.
“Now you say with the keenest joy, ‘Whosoever
will, let him come and drink deeply of the waters
of pure life.’ Those who do this, will never thirst
again. This power you are using and sending forth
is God. The Son accomplishes readily what the
Father accomplishes. This is also being humble to
and bowing before this great power. This is true
humility stepping forth in humble mien, one with
your own driving force and power.
“By constantly contemplating, praising, blessing,
and giving thanks to this power you increase its
flow; and as you do this it becomes potent and more
readily accessible to you.
[22]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
“Thus I say, pray without ceasing. Your daily
life is true prayer.
“By first KNOWING that this power does exist,
then using it with absolute confidence you soon be­
come wholly conscious of it. You soon KNOW that
it is all-inciusive in and through you. If you will
but let it flow, it will rush to you in every instance.
It flows to you as you let it flow from you. Stand
forth as God and give it out. This is God your
Father in you, and you and your Father are one.
Not servants but SONS, Sons of First Primal Cause.
All that I AM has, is yours; for you are I AM.
“It is not I who does the work, it is I AM in the
Father, and the Father in me brings forth the great
accomplishment. As you know that you work, one
with the Father, there are no limitations, no boun­
daries; you know it is your divine right to accom­
plish all things.
“Then follow me only as I follow the Christ, the
true Son, the only-begotten of the Father; and as I
bring forth and present God, I do bring forth God
from within. Then will it be said all are God.
“The greatest sermon ever given is ‘BEHOLD
GOD.’ This means seeing God standing forth in
all glory right within and from you, and from all
others also. When you behold God and nothing else
but God, you love and worship God and God alone;
you truly behold God. You are the Lord, the Law­
giver, the dispenser of the Law.
“When you pray, enter your closet, the secret
chamber of your own soul. There, pray to your
Father within; and your Father, who hears, does
reward you openly. Pray and give thanks that you
are able to give forth more of God to the whole
world.
“Does this not give you a higher and more lofty
outlook, a broader perspective, a nobler ideal?”
[23]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
Here the talk ended. We all arose from the table,
and our friends bade us goodnight and departed.
We stayed on for a time and talked over the experi­
ences, then decided to return to our lodgings in the
village. As we arose, the thought immediately pre­
sented itself, “How are we to proceed without a
light?” and all except the Chief voiced his thought.
Then he said, “You can see how definitely habit
fixes itself upon us and how desperately we cling
to old ideas. Here we are, completely immersed in
light; it has not dimmed because of the absence of
those we have grown to love so dearly. It is not
an occasion where we can step forth and show our
own self-reliance, our own ability to be and to ac­
complish the things that we have experienced? Let
us at least extend this to ourselves and have the
courage to take the step toward the accomplish­
ment.
“We are leaning so hard upon our wonderful
friends that it actually hurts to have them leave
us for a moment. I can see, as they already know,
that if we do not become self-reliant in these small
things, we will never accomplish the larger things;
and I do not doubt for an instant, that they have
left in order to give us the opportunity of proving
the accomplishment. Let us rise to the emergency
and be above it.”
As we started, one of the party suggested that
we meditate on the method of procedure, but the
Chief in a firm voice said, “No, if we go, we go
now. After what we have seen and experienced, we
must act and make these acts definite or we do not
deserve any consideration.” Whereupon we pro­
ceeded down the stairs, through the different rooms,
through the tunnel, and down the ladder to the
village.
As we walked along, our way was completely
[24]
lighted; our bodies seemed without weight, and we
moved with the utmost ease. We arrived at our
lodgings overjoyed by the accomplishment. From
that time on until we left the village we traveled
where we pleased without artificial lights. Our
lodgings lighted up as we entered the rooms, and
the warmth and beauty surpassed any power of
description.
We retired almost immediately. Needless to say
we did not awaken till late the next morning.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[25]
CHAPTER II
T
HE next morning we had our breakfast at the
lodge, then went directly to the upper room of
the Temple. There was no visible concept of
the confines of a room, nor any evidence of limi­
tation and so we moved freely with no thought of
exertion. When we were ready to go below to the
room of the records, we were there. As we had ac­
complished this without the presence of our friends,
we realized the reason for their withdrawal, and
were very much elated over our attainment.
The first of April was fast approaching. We had
finished the records in the Temple rooms and had
taken up the work of making measured drawings
of the numerous characters and many carvings cut
in the rocks outside. This work was going along
very nicely because of our all-absorbing interest.
One afternoon a messenger came to the village, and
as the villagers gathered around him we saw that
something unusual was happening. We dropped our
work and proceeded to the village. We met our
hostess and were informed that a party of bandits
was at large in the valley below.
This caused considerable uneasiness among the
inhabitants, as this village had been the focal point
of attempted raids for many years. The report had
gone far and wide that the Tau Cross Temple was
the hiding place for vast treasure. The many at­
tempts to rob the village had failed. The bands had
in a great measure attributed former failures to the
resistance of the people who lived in the valley be­
low. A number of the bands had now concentrated
their combined forces, and a band of about four
thousand well mounted and armed men were prey-
[26]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
ing upon and devastating the valley, in order to dis­
courage the resistance of the inhabitants in closer
proximity to the little village of the Tau Cross. They
hoped by this method that the raid would be more
successful.
The messenger also appealed for protection for
the remaining inhabitants, as a great many had al­
ready been destroyed and they had reached the limit
of their resistance. He was told that there was no
one in the village who could be sent, but our hostess
assured him that he could return to his home and
that no harm would come to his people. We went on
with our work, noting the uneasiness of the vil­
lagers; and that uneasiness was communicated to us.
The next morning we again resumed our work as
we were very anxious to complete these references
for our records. We were certain they would give
a complete and accurate history, and also references
as to where other records could be found. Thus we
could trace the history of this older and extremely
enlightened civilization that occupied this vast and
now most remote portion of the world.
We were disturbed by the possibility of losing this
collection by reason of the bandit raids. As the
results of our work, this collection was all assem­
bled in the rooms of the records, where they had
hitherto withstood a number of similar raids from
the same source.
That evening we talked to our hostess about the
possibility of the formulation of some plan to aid
the villagers, and voiced our surprise and wonder
at the absence of our friends. We were told that, as
an appeal for aid had been made by the messenger,
the bandits would be obliged to stop their raids or
they would destroy themselves.
We retired that evening fully assured that we had
been over-solicitous of our own safety. We arose
[27]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
early and were preparing to resume work, when the
same messenger appeared with the news that the
raids had ceased upon the inhabitants and that the
band had concentrated their entire force about
twenty miles down the valley for an apparent con­
certed last drive on our little village.
As our hostess and little party stood talking to
the messenger, who was surrounded by a group of
the villagers, a horseman rode into the village and
came toward us. In coming toward us, as he passed
smaller groups of congregated people, he was ap­
parently recognized. They immediately dispersed
and fled in terror. As he neared our group, the mes­
senger called out the horseman’s name; and then the
messenger as well as the others took refuge in flight,
evidently fearing that the horseman was being fol­
lowed by the band.
Our hostess and ourselves were the only ones left
as we awaited the nearer approach of the horseman.
He reined in his horse, and with much gusto ad­
dressing our Chief, began to speak, saying that the
bandits were fully aware we were strangers and that
they were acquainted with our mission. He spoke in
a tongue that none of us understood. He saw our
bewilderment and asked it there were not some one
that could interpret. Our hostess turned and faced
the man as he sat upon his horse and asked if she
could be of service. At first he looked as though he
had received a severe electric shock. He, however,
sufficiently recovered his composure to fairly spring
from his horse. He rushed toward her with out­
stretched hand, exclaiming, “You here?” in the lan­
guage that we understood. Then he placed his
hands to his forehead and prostrated himself before
her, begging her pardon. Oar hostess directed him
to arise and deliver his message. We could see her
form stiffen, and for a moment her features almost
[28]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
blazed with anger. So intense was her display of
emotion that, for an instant, we as well as the man
himself were absolutely startled out of our com­
posure. The words “Coward, murderer, step forth
and deliver your message” almost leapt from her
lips. The man again went to his knees. Again the
words blazed forth, “Stand up. You are so debased
that you dare not stand?”
We did not wonder at the man’s abject terror,
for we, as well as he, were absolutely rooted to the
spot, unable to move.
I am certain had it been humanly possible for the
man to have done so, he would have fled from the
scene. For the moment, he as well as ourselves had
lost all power of speech and action; he crumpled to
the ground, limp and apparently lifeless, his eyes
staring and his mouth agape.
This was the first and only time in our experience
with these people of superior powers that we had
seen one of them give expression in any way to
violent emotion. We were as terrified as the bandit.
The vibrations hit us just as distinctly as the force
of a tremendous explosion, accompanied by an
electric shock that not only paralyzed speech but
our muscles as well; that is the only way I can des­
cribe the sensation. Coming from that slight and
unassuming fragile form, do you wonder that these
vibrations paralyzed us into inaction.
Although this situation lasted only a moment, it
seemed hours before the tension relaxed. We were as
transfixed as statues; yet there flooded over us in
that instant a great pity for the bandit and we found
ourselves longing to go to his assistance. This was
the reaction of all; yet we only stood and stared at
our hostess.
Almost at once the condition changed. At first a
startled look came over her face; then it changed to
[29]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
the same kindly expression that we were accustom­
ed to, and there swept over us such a wave of com­
passion that we rushed to the prostrate form on the
ground. Our hostess was bending over him, her
hand clasping his. Again we were mystified and
could only say, “Will wonders never cease?”
The man soon regained consciousness, was helped
to his feet, and was made as comfortable as possible
on a bench near by. He absolutely refused to enter
any of the houses.
Our hostess then apologized for the vehemence
which she had expressed, noting the effect it had
upon us. Our flesh was quivering and it required
some time for us to regain our composure.
She explained that this man was the leader of one
of the most notorious bands that infested that por­
tion of the Gobi. His name, if mentioned at all, was
spoken with awe, as he was the most fearless and
ruthless of characters. His familiar title literally
translated meant “Consummate Black Devil released
from Hell.” His features portrayed “en masque”
was kept in many villages and worn by those par­
ticipating in the ritual of driving the evil spirit from
the village and its inhabitants.
Our hostess had contacted this man on two for­
mer occasions when attempted raids had failed,
and each time he had evidenced the deepest hatred
for her and our friends in general, going out of his
way to harass them and sending violent messages
from time to time, which they ignored completely.
His sudden appearance alone, had brought the past
indignities so forcibly before her that she for the
time being, had lost control of her emotions.
Having fully regained her composure, she walked
over to the man. At her approach, he made a futile
attempt to arise, but was only able to draw himself
together and sit more erect, the picture of abject
[30]
fear. Hatred was delineated in every movement of
his body, which was trembling as though stricken
with palsy. Our hostess now cool and collected,
with no trace of fear or emotion, her face, features,
and body as wonderfully cut as the most delicate
cameo, presented an amazing contrast.
We wanted to remove the man at once; and al­
though this thought was not expressed, our hostess
raised her hand commanding silence. Our Chief
realized that she was in charge of the situation, and
that anything we would attempt to do would only
place us in a ludicrous position. We withdrew out
of hearing while our hostess talked in low and quiet
tones for quite some time before the man answered
a word.
As he spoke, the lady motioned us to approach.
We sat on the ground before them, glad to make any
move that would relieve the tension of suspense. The
bandit explained that he had prevailed upon his su­
perior leaders to allow him to come as a peace emis­
sary to treat with the people for the surrender of the
supposed treasure that was concealed in the Tau
Cross Temple. If the inhabitants would surrender the
treasure, the bandits would agree not to molest them
further, would agree to release all their prisoners (of
which they claimed there were over three thousand)
and would immediately leave the country and never
again molest the inhabitants of the valley.
Our hostess told him there was no treasure that
would be of any value to them. A thorough expla­
nation of the fact was gone into, with an offer to
conduct him through all the rooms of the Temple
or any place he wished to go. He flatly refused this
proposition, saying that he feared they would hold
him as hostage, and no assurance upon our part
could break down this fear.
Our hostess reassured him of our sincerity, and
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[31]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
he suddenly became convinced that we were honest
in our statements. Then a situation difficult and
alarming for him arose. He told us that he was the
instigator of this plot and had fired the imaginations
of the other bandits with the zeal for possessing the
treasure, and that he had painted a lurid picture of
the fabulous wealth that would be theirs should he
succeed. In fact he and his father had held their
band together with promises of the possession of
this treasure. He was the chief of the band that
had consolidated with five other bands to carry out
this raid.
The crux of this situation was that if he should
return to his band with the information that there
was no treasure, he would immediately be branded
as a traitor and as such would be dealt with accord­
ingly. He could not deter the band from the con­
templated attack, as they would not believe him on
account of his zeal in pressing the situation up to
this point.
It was decidedly an embarrassing position for him.
To our great surprise, our hostess offered to accom­
pany him to the camp. Our protests were quickly
overruled, and she prepared to leave immediately.
She assured us that she was in no danger, but that
if we went along, our presence would instill sus­
picion in the minds of the bandits, so that all would
incur great danger. We meekly submitted. There
was nothing else we could do.
The man mounted his horse, and we assisted her
to mount to the, seat that was prepared behind him.
As they rode from the village, they presented a
never-to-be-forgotten picture, one that will live in
our memories for all eternity—the bandit with
doubt written all over his features, and our hostess
smiling back at us with the calm assurance that she
would return by nightfall. We lost all interest in
[32]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
our work for the rest of the day and wandered aim­
lessly about the village until sunset.
We returned to the lodge to await the return of
our hostess, and upon entering we found the table
loaded with good things to eat. You can imagine
our astonishment to see her seated at the head of
the table and greeting us with that radiant smile of
hers. We were speechless; words failed us entirely.
She assumed an air of mock hauteur and tried to
say sternly, “Gentlemen, a greeting is in order”;
whereupon we bowed and extended our salutations.
Then she continued, “I failed utterly to convince
them, but they did agree to give me an answer with­
in the next three days. I know now that the answer
will be an attempted attack, but I did save the life
of that poor creature for the time being, at least.
We shall be obliged to prepare ourselves to with­
stand the siege; nothing will deter them from
making the attempt.”
I think that nearly all of us saw our
fondest dreams and the results “go a-glimmering”
as the familiar saying has it. Our hostess read
our inmost thoughts, and repeated this poem:—
When you come to the Red-Sea-place in your life,
When, in spite of all you can do,
There is no way ’round, there is no way back,
There is no other way but THROUGH;
Then know God with a soul serene,
And the dark and storm are gone.
God stills the wind. God stills the waves.
God says to your soul, “GO ON!
GO ON! GO ON! GO ON!”
[33]
CHAPTER III
TER the meal was finished, we arose from the
table, our hostess leading us into the garden.
To our great surprise we found Jesus, Emil,
Jast, and Bud Rah, seated. We joined the group
and sat down. We could sense the inaudible sigh
of relief, and realized how much we had grown to
rely upon these people. It was as though we had
fastened ourselves to them with bands of steel.
Somehow I saw that this we must not do. It was
necessary for us to play our definite part in this
great scheme of life, in order that we might not be­
come mere puppets; we must stand wholly upon our
own feet and rely wholly upon ourselves, or they
would be obliged to sever the bands entirely. Our
Chief talked freely upon this subject later.
The evening was still young, and the soft glow of
the fading sunset colors suffused everything with a
luxuriance and beauty that one must see to appreci­
ate. There was not a breath of air stirring, not even
a sound to disturb the tranquility that seemed to en­
gulf us. The bandit situation that we believed had
weighed so heavily upon us but a moment before,
had disappeared entirely.
It was calm and peaceful. There was that beauti­
ful feeling of complete relaxation which again must
be experienced to be understood. It was as though
we were in a great stream of slowly moving light;
we became suddenly aware that we heard the voice
of Jesus but not in words. My only explanation is,
that it was a pure rhythmic, flowing, vibratory in­
fluence that came to us in thought instead of words.
The effect was much more pronounced than that of
words; the rhythm and cadence were beyond de­
[34]
scription. Thoughts seemed to flood in and lodge;
this was an entirely new experience.
As these thoughts or ideas came, we translated
them into stenographic characters, then transposed
them into words and sentences, later submitting
them to these people for approval.
“When I say, Behold a Christ of God is here, I
behold the God-man standing forth. I see this body
as the true temple of God, the perfect instrument or
channel through which the Great Creative Principle
flows and comes forth freely; then this creation is
unadulterated in image, form, and likeness. I AM
GOD. In this attitude I stand forth the master of
every situation, the Christ of God triumphant.
“It is this ideal that I worship; and that which I
worship, I bring forth. I can in no way bring forth
God if I AM does not present God to all humanity.
In this attitude man stands forth the master of
every situation; the Christ is triumphant, conquer­
ing. God and man are walking hand in hand, ONE.
There is but one Principle, one Man.”
One of our party thought for a moment and then
asked, “How can we bring forth this light and make
practical use of it?”
The answer came. “Let your body become a
generator through which this Great Creative Radiat­
ing Principle flows. See this Principle as the emana­
tion of all power, know that it is the principle of all
power; then, like an electric generator, your body
will collect and magnify this energy until you send
it out as a stream of pure white light, that nothing
can resist, and anything directed toward you cannot
harm you.
“You can also send such intense impulses of elec­
trical energy over these light beams that the body of
the one attempting to harm you, will be destroyed.
Any resistance to this energy immediately magnifies
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[35]
its volume and therefore its velocity. The ones set­
ting up resistance against it or attempting to set up
their personal will, only harm themselves. If they
do not set up any resistance to this light, it will pour
its healing balm through them as well as it does
through vou.
“It is the nure God-beam and power, which blends
with that of another at all times if the^e is no resist­
ance to its free flow. It vibrates with the highest
vibration; consequently all are vibrating in perfect
harmony and accord, and no harm can possibly
come to them, as they are in unison with the God
vibration. There is absolutely nothing that can
harm another unless that one resists the God vibra­
tion. Vibration is life. Do you not see how you
stand one with God at all time? In this attitude
would there be a possibility of separation? The only
separation is the resistance that causes the inhar­
mony.
“Nothing can come near you when you stand in
the Holy Mount, One with God. This is not a special
privilege for a few, this is for all; I AM, the great
absolute cause or source in which every child stands
one with God. Thus all live under THE LAW, the
highest vibratory thought action. There is not an
inharmonious vibration that can enter this sphere,
this throne, where all belong and are at home. This
is your Divine Kingdom.
“You can also use this power to return false and
harmful thoughts or desires that are directed to­
ward you. You can if you so desire, step up this
white God-light-beam, endow it with God-power,
magnify and transform the energy the sender has
given the thing or condition that was intended for
you, then place it into your reflector and send it
back to the sender with the velocity of light. When
you return it in this way it is a beam of pure white
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[36]
4
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
light, instead of merely lowered vibrations, as it
was sent out to you.
“When it reaches the sender, the impulses are so
potent that it can destroy the body of the one who
first put in motion the lower vibration. It matters
not whether you know the sender or the location
from which it came, the vibration will return to its
source unerringly. The judgment or day of retribu­
tion has arrived. As you give, so you receive good
measure (God measure) pressed down and running
over.
“You can transform God-power and send it out
with such force that it is irresistible. These are the
beams or rays of light that you see emanating from
my body. These rays are emanating from your body,
although they are not yet as potent, but as you go on
and use this power, allied with Law or Principle,
you will add potency to the light and can con­
sciously direct it to accomplish any good desire.
“When the artist portrayed me at Gethsemane,
the rays of light went out from my body instead of
coming out from heaven to me. The light is the
God-power generated from within my body, then
sent out by the reflector. These beams go out from
every body when that person stands forth as God in
his divine heritage—the Christ of God ALL ONE.
“This is and can be made the definite motto of all
humanity. Can there be discord between brothers if
they become this all-absorbing One?
“Now step up this white beam which is the God-
beam upon which you send out God-power; endow
it with God-power transformed, ten thousand or ten
million times greater than that which has been sent
out to you and which you are returning (this is as
you decree); then let it flow back upon the same
path that the vibrations of the thing traveled to you.
When the person receives this ray and accepts it as
[37]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
coming from God, the attempted harm is all erased,
forgiven, forgotten, and no harm can come to you
or the sender of that harmful thought. You are both
eye to eye one with God. Instead of inharmony
there is perfect harmony, you are again ONE.
“If the sender of the harmful thought does not
accept the white ray which you have sent out in all
its potency, his body will be destroyed. This pure
white ray will completely erase every vibration of
harm or discord if allowed to complete its perfect
work. If resisted, there is nothing but a perfect
erasure for the one who holds determinedly to the
resistance. His resistance draws to him the whole
creative principle, ADVERSELY, as to the square
of the resistance set up. The square means multiply­
ing the resistance four times.
“Thus you see that as you send out good or evil it
will return to you fourfold.
“You are standing forth as the Lord or Law giv­
ing forth Good or God for evil, but even in this atti­
tude be truly humble, JUDGE NOT. Place every bit
of love you possess upon this pure white ray, and
see well to it that it is the pure love of God that
you are generating and sending forth. As you ac­
complish this, legions are at your command. You
are still meek and humble, willing to follow on with
the light. It is the pure light of God that you follow;
and that light is life, love, purity and beauty, eternal
and profound.
“There are seven centers in your body that can be
used as reflectors. You can cause these central
points to glow with a radiance far greater than any
artificial light, and when you wish to send out this
light, it glows with a greater potency and will reach
farther than any electrical beam that can be pro­
jected.
“By setting all these centers aglow at the same
[38]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
tíme, you are completely surrounded by an armour
that nothing can penetrate.
“You can send out the pure white ray of God,
so energized that your body actually glows with a
brilliancy far greater than that of the noonday sun.
You stand forth Lord of Creation, the Lord of Hosts.
You stand forth true and triumphant yet peaceful,
loving, God enthroned in your body, and that body
beautiful, spiritual, and divine.”
As these vibrations came to us, the light emanat­
ing from the bodies of Jesus and his group was most
difficult to behold; yet there was that vibrant bril­
liancy shining through, which resembled liquid
gold. To our vision there seemed to be an indefi­
niteness, while to all of the other senses there was
the solidity of rock. Again the vibrations came:—
“In this way you can make your body completely
invisible to mortal sight by focusing your entire
thought fully and definitely upon the pure white
God ray and letting it go forth from the seven cen­
ters as reflectors, in unison.
“Then again you can step right out on either of
these rays and present any picture that you wish, to
those that would do you harm. You can follow on
this beam with the exact speed of light, and go
where you will, instantly. Your body is invisible to
those who do not see through and beyond the mor­
tal. They are aware that there is something they
do not understand; thus they are susceptible to any
picture you wish to present to them. That which
they do not understand is mysterious or super­
natural, and the faculty which is developed through
suspicion or superstition is easily misled. Thus you
send out love to those that would do you harm, and
the energy they release reflects back to them.
“The picture of harm they have sent out depicts
the lower man of each one fighting that which they
[39]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
believe to be their enemy, when in reality they are
fighting the picture of their own lower selves. These
pictures change the closest friends into enemies and
array brother against brother.
“Should this band still persist in their threatened
attack and raid, they will destroy each other. They
now have the opportunity of leaving the district and
its inhabitants unmolested, or they will turn and
destroy themselves. Man cannot attempt to destroy
his brother without meeting the same fate for him­
self. We send only the pure white ray of God love to
them and if they resist that love with hate, malice or
revenge, they, of their own free will, turn that ray
into a flame that will consume them. You need have
no fear. We offer only love and have no power to
compel them to accept. If the bandits come with
love, there will be no conflict. Our cause is already
won.”
At this juncture a call came that there was a
messenger approaching the village. We went out to
meet him. He told us that the bandits had discon­
tinued their raids and were peacefully encamped
about twenty miles from the Tau Cross and had not
harmed any of the inhabitants or their possessions
since the appeal for help, but that they were holding
the prisoners as hostages against further resistance.
He also said there was a persistent rumor that the
band would attack our village within the next day
or two if the treasure was not delivered the follow­
ing day.
The messenger brought greetings from the captive
people. Every man had offered his life for the pro­
tection of the village. The messenger was told that
this sacrifice would not be necessary, and that he
could return with the thanks and deepest apprecia­
tion of the villagers for the proffered service.
[40]
CHAPTER IV
W
E resumed our work next morning with re­
newed zest, having banished all fear from
our thoughts. On the morning of the second
day we were working on some of the figures carved
in the rock of the canyon wall.
Suddenly our attention was drawn to the village
sentry whose position was across the canyon at a
greater elevation, affording a much wider outlook.
Through our field glasses we saw him signal the
village. Soon the villagers were hurrying to and fro
evidently seeking protection in the great gorges
deeper in the mountain fastness. All the inhabitants
were deeply agitated.
As we listened we could hear the low thundering
roar of the advancing horde. One of our party
climbed to a higher position which gave a broader
view of the situation. He called back, stating that he
could see the cloud of dust raised by the horsemen
as they advanced toward the entrance of the can­
yon. We secreted our equipment in a nearby cre­
vasse, joined our associate and found shelter in the
surrounding crags and rocks where we could ob­
serve the movements of the band. As they entered
the canyon, the band halted; fifty horsemen rode
forward as an advance guard, then the whole band
moved up the canyon, spurring and lashing their
horses into a wild gallop. The clatter and roar of
the hoofs over the rocky floor, coupled with shouts
of defiance, caused an indescribable din. Had it
not been so tragic at the time, it would have been
awe-inspiring to witness this great body of horse­
men sweeping forward.
Our position was very advantageous, as the canyon
walls were nearly precipitous so that we could look
[41]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
directly down upon the bandit horde as they swept
on with the seemingly irresistible force of a great
tidal wave.
The advance band of intruders had swept past our
position, and those in the lead of the main band
were fast approaching. We had turned our field
glasses on the little village for the moment and ob­
served that it was panic-stricken.
One member of our party working on the ledge,
stopped work and was watching the advancing band.
We saw him turn and look through the door leading
to the entrance of the center room1of the Temple.
Our field glasses were all centered upon the figure
of Jesus as He advanced through the door and step­
ped upon the ledge, walking directly to the brink
and standing for a moment with body magnificently
poised.
This ledge was about eight hundred feet above
where we were concealed and nearly three miles
distant. Instantly we realized that He was speaking,
and in another moment the words came to us clear
and distinct. Our associate on the ledge sat down
and began taking notes in shorthand which I did
also. Later comparison showed that we heard His
words distinctly above the din of the advancing
hordes. We were told that He did not raise His
voice above His natural well-modulated tones.
As Jesus began speaking, a perfect calm came
over the entire village and its inhabitants. These are
His words translated into English by Jesus Himself.
My most fervent prayer will always be that I shall
never forget them though I live to be ten thousand
years.
[42]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
THE LIGHT
“As I stand alone in Your great silence, God my
Father, in the midst of me there blazes a pure light
and it fills every atom of my whole being with its great
radiance. Life, Love, Strength, Purity, Beauty, Per­
fection, stand forth in all dominion within me. As I
gaze into the very heart of this light, I see another
light,— liquid, soft, golden-white and radiantly lumi­
nous,— absorbing, mothering and giving forth the
caressing fire of the Greater Light.
Now I know that I am God, and one with God’s
whole universe. I whisper to God my Father, and I
am undisturbed.
STILL IN THE SILENCE
Yet in this complete silence there exists God’s
Greatest Activity. Again 1 am undisturbed, and com­
plete silence is all about me. Now the radiance of this
light spreads to God’s vast universe, and everywhere
I know there is God’s conscious life. Again 1say fear­
lessly, 1 am God; I am silent and unafraid.
I lift the Christ high within me and sing God’s
praise. In the tones of my music inspiration hums.
Louder and louder within me the Great Mother sings
of new life. Louder and clearer with each new day,
inspiration is lifting my conscious thought until it is
attuned to God’s rhythm. Again I lift the Christ high
and give close ear that I may hear the glad music. My
keynote is harmony and the theme of my song is God,
and God seals my song as Truth.
BEHOLD I AM BORN ANEW, A
CHRIST IS HERE
I am free with the great light of Your Spirit, God
my Father. Your seal is placed upon my forehead.
I accept.
I hold your light high, God my Father. Again, 1
accept.”
[43]
As Jesus ceased speaking, a dazzling ray of pure
white light shot out from the center of the solar part
of His body. This bead of light extended down the
canyon some distance to where the gorge made an
abrupt left turn, just ahead of the place where the
advanced group of horsemen were riding.
At the point where this light beam terminated, a
great barrier like a stone wall seemed to rise in­
stantly; and great darts that appeared like flaming
arrows shot out from this barrier.
The advancing horses stopped so suddenly in their
mad forward dash, that they unseated a number of
their riders. Many of them paused for a moment
with their heads and forefeet in the air, then turned
and bolted down the canyon completely out of con­
trol. When they reached the advance ranks of the
main band, those riders that had not been unseated
attempted to control their horses but to no avail.
These, as well as the riderless horses, plunged on
and into the front ranks of the moving band. Here
the movements of the front ranks were checked,
while the ranks in the rear, not realizing their dan­
ger, came on and surged over those in advance, un­
til the canyon below us was a seething mass of men
and horses.
For an instant all was a dead calm save for the
wild screams of frightened men and mad horses,
where the wild stampede of the advance riders had
clashed with the forward columns of the main band.
There, a terrific scene was taking place. The rider­
less horses entirely free from restraining hands, had
plunged headlong into and over the advanced ranks,
unseating many more men; and they with their
ungoverned mounts, added to the confusion. The
horses began rearing, plunging, and screaming as
only dumb animals can, in a moment of uncon­
trolled and violent fright. This mad melee was com­
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[44]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
municated through the massed horde in the canyon
below us.
Suddenly we saw men draw their short swords
and slash wildly in every direction; others drew
their firearms and began shooting at men and
horses in an attempt to clear the way for an escape.
It soon developed into a battle of the survival of the
fit. It ended in a mad dash for liberty of those
who were fortunate enough to escape the shambles,
leaving the gorge cluttered with great heaps of
dead and wounded men and horses. We hurried
down to give what aid we could to the wounded.
All of the inhabitants and our friends joined us.
Messengers were sent out far and wide for assist­
ance. We worked feverishly through the night and
till after sunup the next morning.
As rapidly as we were able to extricate the
wounded ones from the terrible debris, Jesus and
our friends would take them in hand. When the
last man was cared for, we returned to the lodge for
breakfast. Much to our surprise, as we entered, we
found the Black Bandit talking to Emil. It was the
first time that any of us had been conscious that
Emil had been present. He saw our look of wonder­
ment and said, “That will keep until later.”
After the meal was finished, we walked outside
with the Chief and he told us that Emil and himself
had come upon the man seriously wounded, and
unable to move, as he was held down by his fallen
horse. They had freed him and carried him to the
temporary shelter where he was made as comfort­
able as possible; then they had called our hostess
and turned him over to her care. After his wounds
were dressed, he asked if she would ask her God to
show him what to do to be like her. He also asked
her to teach him how to pray.
She asked him if he wished to be whole and well
[45]
and he replied, “Yes, wholly like you.” She an­
swered “Now that you have asked for wholeness,
your prayer is answered; you are completely whole
now.”
The man lapsed into a deep slumber. At midnight
when our Chief made his rounds, he found that the
wounds had completely closed, and there was not a
scar left. The man arose, dressed, and volunteered
to assist in the rescue work.
We also saw a great number that we thought
were just slipping into the great shadow, restored
completely. Some would cringe in terror at the ap­
proach of our friends,—so much so, that it became
necessary to separate them from the others.
After the rescue work was finished, the “Black One”
as we called him, went about among his wounded
associates, doing all he could to alleviate their fears.
Many seemed like animals caught in a trap, fearing
that a terrible death by torture awaited them, as
that was the sentence meted out to them through
the law of that land, should a bandit be captured.
So definite had this belief become fixed in their
minds that they never responded to the kindness be­
stowed upon them. They feared they were being
nurtured back to health so that the torture would
be of greater duration.
All were finally healed of their wounds, although
a few lingered for months, evidently thinking they
were delaying the day of torture.
The Black One later organized all of the wounded
who would join him, into a protective unit against
further raids, and also induced many of the inhabi­
tants to join this unit. From that time on, we were
later informed, the bandit groups never again at­
tempted to raid that district.
Later, two of our expeditions passed through that

territory on their way to the Gobi. This man with his
followers conducted them safely through his own
district and the adjoining district, a distance of over
four hundred miles, and neither he nor his followers
would accept any compensation for that service. We
have been told many times that he has become a
great power for good throughout the district, giving
his entire life freely to the people without remunera­
tion.

[47]
CHAPTER V
B
Y noon of the second day, the wounded had all
been cared for, and we made a last survey to
make sure that there were no more wounded
alive among the debris. On our way to the lodge for
lunch and much-needed rest, one of the party voiced
the thought which had been uppermost for hours in
all our minds. Why this terrible holocaust, this de­
struction of life?
We were tired to the very marrow of our bones
and were completely floored by the shock. The
brunt of the rescue work, especially in the early
hours, had fallen to our lot, as the inhabitants had
stood in such mortal terror of these bandits that it
was very difficult to persuade them to lend assist­
ance even after we had freed many from the en­
tangled horses.
The villagers could see no reason why they should
assist in saving the lives of those who were attempt­
ing to take their lives. Many of them have a deep
aversion to touching any dead thing. Had it not
been for our friends, the inhabitants would have left
the scene immediately, never to have returned. As
it was, we were weary and heartsick, having under­
gone the most terrible experience of our whole lives.
We arrived at the lodge, refreshed ourselves and
sat down at the table completely unnerved. Shortly
the food began to appear. We were all alone, our
chief having accompanied one or two of our friends
and Lin Chu, the Black One, on a trip down the
valley. After the meal we retired to our rooms to
rest and none of the party awoke till late the enxt
afternoon.
While we were dressing, it was suggested that we
go directly to our sanctuary as we called the upper
[48]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
room of the Temple. We left the lodge and started
to walk to the Temple as had been the custom on
previous occasions. We had proceeded to the ladder
that led to the entrance of the tunnel, when the one
who was in advance, stopped with one foot on the
first rung and said: “What has come over us? Just
a day or two ago we were in the seventh heaven of
delight, going from place to place at will and ac­
complishing things in three months that we had ex­
pected would take years to finish. Our food appears
on the table, and all of this without the least exert-
tion on our part. Now, suddenly, we have slumped
back into our old habits. I want to know why this
sudden slump? I can see only one thing. Every one
of us has taken upon himself the condition of the
experience through which we have passed. This is
what is now hampering us, and I for one am
through with that thing, it is no part of me whatso­
ever. It is not mine only as I worship it and hold to
it and do not let it go. I step forth out of this condi­
tion into a higher and better condition, and let go. I
am entirely through with it.” As we stood and stared
at him, we realized he was gone, he had disappeared.
We were nonplussed for the moment as we saw
this man attain, yet none of us would let go of that
which was holding us back, though knowing full
well that we were still holding on to a condition that
did not concern us in the least. Consequently we
were obliged to climb the ladder, go through the
tunnel, then up through the different rooms to reach
our objective. When we arrived, we found our as­
sociate already there.
As we were talking of the accomplishment, Jesus,
the other friends, and our Chief appeared. They
walked into the room through the door that opened
on to the ledge. We sat down and Jesus began by
saying: “There are so many declaring that they are
[49]
the sons of God and that they have all that the
Father has. They do have all that the Father has,
but this statement has not been made a fact until
they have the courage to take the next step and see
themselves as God,—one with all that God is; then
they do accomplish. When the one in mortal limited
thought sees the Christ stand forth, that finer indi­
viduality does radiate light. That one that is project­
ing the Christ does see with a finer, clearer, and
more extended vision. That one sees the higher body
of himself vibrating at a higher rate than does his
limited body that he also sees.
“He thinks that these are two bodies. He also
thinks that that body which appears outside and
away from his body, is the Christ of another. These
which appear two are only an appearance, because
he does not believe that he is the Christ. Let this
one declare himself the Christ and actually accept
it as a fact; that instant, these two merge and that
one has brought forth the Christ. Then the Christ
stands forth triumphant. Now let him go one step
farther and declare that the Christ of God stands
forth, and that instant he is the Christ of God. Now
the Son of God is one with God the Father, and he
does go directly to the Father. That one must go one
more step. This is the greatest step and takes the
greatest determination, as every fear of mortal
thought and limitation must be erased: he must step
forth, go forth direct to God the source or the
Father, and declare definitely and know positively
without fear of precedent or superstition, or man­
made belief, that he is God; that he is merged whol­
ly or amalgamated with God; and that he is this
Love, Wisdom, Understanding. That he is substance.
That he is every attribute of God the Father, the
source, the Principle. He must accept this in all
humility,—such an one does show forth God.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[50]
Through such an one, every one of the God attri­
butes does flow out to the whole world. To that one,
nothing is impossible. It is only through such an one
that God can express. When you amalgamate your­
self with God, nothing is impossible to you. You not
only have all the Father has, but you are all that
the Father is. You are the trinity. You are the man-
Christ, Christ of God, GOD, all three in ONE. The
Holy Spirit abides with you. The Whole-I-Spirit in
creative action, abides with you. When you accept
this, then you, as well as all others, will sing ALL
HAIL the power of the Christ name, not the name
of Jesus the personal, but the Christ. Let angels
prostrate fall; bring forth the royal diadem and
crown Christ Lord of all. You do not crown the per­
sonal Jesus, you crown Christ; and Christ deserves
the most magnificent of all royal diadems in the
Christly crown. There are no diadems too great or
tqo divine for the crown of the triumphant Christ.
You see that whosoever will, may come. Come forth
and become the triumphant Christ. Whosoever
will, let them come.
“When you say ‘God,’ see yourself as God. See
God standing forth as you stand forth. God cannot
be a bigot or a boaster or an egotist. Neither can
the Christ, the God-man, the image and likeness of
God, be any of these things. You can be just God
and so is God-man. I AM is in the Father and the
Father is in me, are true words. I AM and my
Father are ONE in all meekness and Almighty Great­
ness. God and all mankind united are Almighty
—the Almightiness of God.
“That which was born in your so-called iniquitous
thought is raised in glory because the thought of in­
iquity is erased. That which has borne the image of
the earthly, must and does bear the divine image
when you raise up that ideal image.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[51]
“I say to you that now, this instant, is the great
opportunity for you to step forth, out of this outer
turmoil, into the great peace and blessings of God,
and clothe yourself with the light of God. In all
meekness, place the crown of Christ upon your
head, and unless you yourself do this, no other
can place it there for you.
“Step up to and be a part of the great white
throne, the source. Become one with those that have
made the great accomplishment in like manner; be
not only one with God but be God, actually GOD.
Then you can and do present the divine attributes to
the whole world. How can God-energy get into ex­
pression except through man? There is not an or­
ganism upon the whole earth that can vibrate at
the same rate or frequency; and in consequence, it
is so highly organized that it does perceive, then
generate and transform this supreme energy, which
enables man to express God to the whole world.
How can this be done except through the highly or­
ganized and perfected body which you are when you
are in full control of this body?
“That control means full and complete Master­
ship, Messiahship, Discipleship. You are only in con­
trol of, and in perfect harmony with, this body
when you stand forth in perfect dominion and mas­
tery in all the attributes of the Holy Trinity.
“The I AM man, the Christ, the Christ of God;
then combining these three with the highest, God,—
you are GOD.
“This is you, the man of today (all humanity)
extending your vision and perceiving the truth about
yourselves, that there is a higher and better life for
you than the round of mundane experiences. This
you perceive as you follow the right-used (right­
eous) path, in harmony and true accord, with the
highest ideals you can present, or look forward to.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[52]
“The first step, you, man, become the Christ man,
the only begotten son of God. The next step, you
become the Christ of God by seeing the Christ-man,
the Christ of God. You have joined the Christ-man
to the Christ of God; then in order to go direct to
the source, you must make these One, God the
Father. You have now brought together the I AM
man into the Christ-man; then you have trans­
formed this Christ-man into the Christ of God, or
the Lord God. Then through your next step you
have transformed the Christ of God into the ever-
living God. These which seemed two, have become
ONE, God. You are the image and likeness of Su­
preme Energy, God, the Father of all. There is not
one thing that will be impossible to you if you do
not deviate from this path of right-use-ness. In this
you must be absolutely fearless and true, regardless
of what the whole world may think. In standing
forth and acknowledging your dominion and at-one-
ment, you are at one with the Father, the outpour­
ing and ever-present Supreme Principle of all
things.
“With this light, does not your Bible present a
great allegorical depiction of man’s spiritual devel­
opment and attainment, when rightly understood or
righteously used?
The shaft of light that is pictured as coming to
me from heaven, is projected outwardly from my
body. It is true that this light is from heaven, as
heaven is all about us and is light vibration. The
actual focal center or starting point of heaven must
be right within my body. Therefore, this heavenly
light must come forth from me. The I AM of me
must allow this light essence to come in; then I must
generate and transform this light energy so that it
can be sent out with any density that God, the I AM,
desires. When this is done, nothing can resist the
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[53]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
power of this pure light. These are the beams or
rav of light that you see emanating from my body
when the artist portrayed me at Gethsemane. The
beams of light went out from my body instead of
coming out of heaven to me.
“Just so, can you transform God-power and send
it out, with such force that it is irresistible. It is
the God-power, which is recognized all about you,
allowed to come in, be generated and transformed
within your body, then sent out through the re­
flector.
“These things are readily accomplished by all
when they stand forth as God, their divine heritage,
the Christ of God, all One. This is the divine and
definite motto for all humanity.
“The closer humanity draws to this great healing
ray, the earlier will discord and inharmony be
erased.
“If you live freely in this light vibration which is
the light of the whole world, and all draw near to it,
the closer you will draw to man’s true abiding-place.
Thus you find that I AM is the light of the whole
world. Behold God, the table is spread. Lift up this
mighty one of God, this I AM. Lift this body to God
and you and all are crowned Lord of All.
“You do place the crown upon your own head;
none can do this for you.”
[54]
CHAPTER VI
M
Y ONLY apology for dwelling in detail upon
the experiences of these few days in regard
to the bandits, is to portray as conclusively as
possible, the power of one man clothed completely
in his divine right of dominion and mastery, to turn
the energy and zeal exerted and sent out bv a great
lawless horde, to the complete protection of himself
and the whole district.
This protection was not only afforded, but the en­
ergy and zeal released by the horde was so great that
when it was magnified, energized, and returned, it
caused those that would destroy, to turn unon and
destroy themselves. It also afforded complete pro­
tection to the whole countryside for many miles
around although the inhabitants were outnumbered
bv the bandits at least three to one, and they had no
visible weapons of defense.
As soon as the excitement and the shock of the
previous days had abated, we returned to our work
with renewed interest. The Easter season was fast
approaching and we wished to complete our work
in this locality in order to return to India.
From this time on, our work drew rapidly to a
close. The last details preparatory to the return were
completed the day before Easter. We looked for­
ward to Easter Sunday as a day of complete rest
and relaxation.
On our way to the Temple long before dawn, we
found Chander Sen seated in the garden. He arose
to accompany us saying that our Chief would meet
us in the Sanctuary. He suggested that we return
to India by way of Lhasa, thence to Muktinath,
through the Trans-Himalaya Pass to Kandemath,
thence to Darjeeling. As we reached the foot of the
[55]
ladder which led to the Temple entrance, we halted
for a moment to view the approaching dawn.
Chander Sen placed one hand upon the ladder and
stood as though about to ascend to the tunnel en­
trance.
In this attitude he began talking: “Light does not
comprehend darkness, as it shines through dark­
ness. When Jesus saw that he was to be betrayed by
Judas, He said, ‘Now is the Son of man glorified,
and God is glorified in him.’ The Master mind did
not say, ‘Judas betrayed me’; He did not refer to
Judas at all. He understood and held only to the All-
ness of the glorified Christ of God flowing through
Himself. Man glorified in God. God glorifies man
in himself. Thus we see that perfect mutual action
works out all inharmony in its own way. Now you
can say, ‘Christ, stand forth more and more definite­
ly, so definite that you are myself.’ In fact, now are
we one body, one mind, one spirit; one whole, com­
plete principle. You are I AM, together we are God.”
The moment he ceased speaking we were in our
Sanctuary, the center room of the Tau Cross Tem­
ple. We had scarcely composed ourselves when
Jesus and a number of others including our Chief,
entered by the door that communicated with the
ledge.
As they entered, a great burst of light filled the
room. Greetings were exchanged and we were in­
troduced to the stranger who entered with them.
He appeared to be an elderly man, yet very vital.
We were told that he was one of the munis who had
charge of the caves near Hastinapur. He was return­
ing to that district and would accompany us. He
had known the great Rishi Yegas and also had met
Rishi Agastya whose hermitage is located in that
most lovely yet secluded spot. We were overjoyed
at our good fortune.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[56]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
We formed a circle; and placing both hands,
palms down, upon the table, stood in deep silence
for a few moments. Although there was not a word
uttered the room was completely filled with a
strange, pulsing, vibrating emanation. It was an en­
tirely different sensation from anything we had ever
experienced and at first seemed to overwhelm us.
The rocks pulsated and vibrated with a resonant
musical tone. This lasted only a few moments.
When the stillness was broken we were told that
this morning we would see the creation of a uni­
verse in pictures. These pictures would be a repre­
sentation of that which happened when our uni­
verse came into existence.
We stepped through the door, out upon the ledge,
and walked to the edge. It was still an hour before
sunrise. The dead calm of the absolute silence en­
shrouded us. The time was propitious for the unfold­
ing of another birth. We were looking out and out
into infinite space, our souls eager and expectant.
The Muni began by saying, “There are but two
events in the world: that which was in existence be­
fore consciousness began to assert itself, is now, and
ever shall be; and the things that humanity has
thought and will think about.
“That which was, before consciousness began, is
eternal. That which humanity thinks, is change­
able and inconstant. That which was, before con­
sciousness began, is Truth. That which humanity
thinks is truth, is truth to them. When the Law of
Truth comes to consciousness, it will erase all that
humanity has ever thought erroneously.
“As the centuries roll on and push back the mate­
rial veil by the process of evolution, thoughts come
through the mind of humanity that revert back to
Truth, or as we call it, the original cosmic fact; and
these thoughts that fill the memory of the past,
[57]
faced with the facts of the present, and overshad­
owed bv pronhecies of the future, stand out defi­
nitely, upon the path of the whole evolving race con­
sciousness. Thus the race is called back again and
again to the original existing principle. Bv this re­
turn and repetition, humanity is shown that Crea­
tion is eternal, the same with all mankind; but
mankind’s creatures are alwavs changing, and they
are under a manifestation of Law called action and
reaction. When human beings pave gon° far
enough in their creation of creatures, the great Ab­
solute Law of Truth takes a hand in bringing them
face to face with the original plan. Thus we see that
cosmic law never allows life to run too far in a tan­
gent. This law is always polarized in equalization,
balance and harmony.
“In spite of idols or creeds it will crowd mankind
on into complete union with Absolute Realities. All
things that are not in perfect accord and union with
actual, existing cosmic fact, must erase themselves
when the Absolute Law of Truth holds sway in the
human consciousness. The thoughts of humanity
are always so formed as to release their imperfect
creations, that are only born of half-truths, when
Truth arrives.
“Cosmic Absolute Law must be fully satisfied.
Thinking, speaking, or acting the Law of Reality
is bound eventually to lead humanity into Law or
Reality itself. The ancients tell us that every tree
that the Heavenly Father has not planted within
you, will be uprooted. ‘Let them alone, blind leaders
of the blind. If the blind always lead the blind,
shall they not fall into the same ditch?’
“The cycle is fast closing in which the blind of
the whole race have led the blind into a welter of ig­
norance, superstition, and delusion created by those
who believe as human beings think, rather than that
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[58]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
which is true and real. The civilization that has
risen on the delusions and superstitions of the clos­
ing centuries is submerging itself in the welter.
Through the pain and tragedy of their misappro­
priated creations, a new race consciousness has been
conceived and is fast evolving. In fact, the door is
opening wide for its new birth.
“There is no other counsel than to go on from one
plane of consciousness to a higher and more ad­
vanced step in the actual cosmic path. The only con­
dition forbidden in the vibration of the great cos­
mos, is that quality of thought which allows the hu­
man race to become so solidly fixed in what it be­
lieves, that if it clings desperately to its old delusions
and will not let go, it can in no way come into the
greater expanse of universal thought. Those thus
absorbed in personal consciousness, must go on
through natural exhaustion of beliefs and experi­
ences until they fail to go forward; then of its own
accord, Absolute Law wields a progressive hand
through disease, pain and loss, until the human is
satisfied and turns to find the curse of a false idea
within the idea itself.
If a race or nation refuse to let go of things cre­
ated by a portion of human thought instead of that
which really exists, the Law takes a hand in its pro­
gress, by allowing the accumulated vibrations sent
out by such a condition, to reflect back upon itself
through the light ray. Then with war, strife, dis­
cord, and death on ever hand, that race or nation
is wiped out, in order that it may be placed again
in a new up-lift of creation. Thus it can begin over
again in a new contact with that which was before
the beginning of human consciousness. Civilization
today is fast approaching a great reconstructive mo­
ment. All things that seem so stable and well-
founded now, will soon be immersed in a state of
[59]
inversion. Every tree that has not been planted by
Truth, will be uprooted. There is approaching a
complete, cosmic overthrow of the present social,
political, financial, and religious institutions, that
will make room for the placing of the new era in
order that humanity may come in closer touch with
that which is and was established before the present
human consciousness submerged and set it aside.
Truth waits on with attentive, loving, and radiant
beneficence until man will see that he can embrace
and become the consciousness of that which has
always existed.
“Humanity is taking a forward step from the
cradle stories of the former generation, and their
creations are no longer of any avail to the arisen
individuality and spiritual discernment of the con­
sciousness of the generation that is fast approach­
ing. Delusions, traditions, and superstitions are
nearing the end. It is also true of the civilization
which they established. The old idols are good
enough for the infantile consciousness that is near­
ing an impasse. Their delusion has caused their un­
doing as they are proved to be only cradle stories
woven by a mastercraft of priesthood and preceptor,
to lull into false sleep the crying infants of an evolv­
ing race. Those who saw farther afield did not cry
and thus were not lulled to sleep. Most of them saw
that the cradle stories were not true, and many
stepped boldly forth to erase the untruth; as they
saw directly through to the Absolute, that which has
always existed, and which has always been seen and
known and contacted directly by a portion of man­
kind. From this portion, there will arise a new
and more vitalizing consciousness, fully awake and
ready to erase the idols that man has set up for his
fellow man to follow, and make room for the new
ideals which are as old as creation’s dawn.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[60]
“These will demand of those who teach, lead, or
inspire the race-consciousness, that they shall do it
from a plane of actual living contact, so high that
there can be no mistake or contradiction, and on a
plane of interpretation that is so simple that it can­
not be misunderstood. The awakened tiger of higher
intelligence and spirituality will refuse to sleep
again, as it is already ravaged with the fragments
of the past and disappointed with the torture of mis­
placed confidence. It will demand a stronger and
more vital thought with instructions based upon
Truth itself.
“The multitudes are now listening, over the heads
of past centuries with their creed-bound traditions,
to the old, old message that to the newly-born is
working its unfoldment into the hearts and lives of
mankind. This new-old message is the clarion call
that is heard above the chanting voices of creed-
bound priesthood. It is louder than the voice of
battle; it is louder and clearer than the muffled con­
tradictions of financial, industrial, political, and re­
ligious lies.
“In spite of the creed-bound thoughts of a portion
of humanity, their traditional and idolized ideas of
God, of Christ and man, of self, of life and death,
all must go; and in the absolute freedom from these
preconceived ideas, there must pass and thus be
erased, all that was built upon them.
“There is looming upon the horizon of this new
approach, a redemption that has an entirely new
meaning. This new multitude coming out of this
clearer vision and more definite perception, is re­
deemed through deeper revelation emanating out of
all races and all people. That emanation is the One
Life that is in all and through all.
“In spite of the delusion-bound multitude, their
clinging bands and cringing attitude, a greater and
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[61]
more noble vista of the expanding horizon of God,
the Christ of man, the Christ of God, of Self, and
death itself, is looming; and another cycle of spirit
is dawning for the whole world. Another age of the
Crystal Race is coming up out of the maelstrom.
“Whenever a people or nation think of God as
Absolute, that people or nation is God, for God is
established unto them. As they love, worship, and
reverence that ideal, they do become God. In the
fullness of time they have reached their heritage,
that which was first, and is established in Spirit.
Whenever an individual thinks of God, he is God,
God is established unto him. Breathe life into hu­
manity, it means the same, God. In this greater
understanding of cosmic revelation, men find God
the same as God was before human consciousness
began to manifest—the same yesterday, today, and
forever.
“There is slowly rising from the ashes of ortho­
doxy, the actual temple not made by hands, eternal
in heaven, in man. A great new race of thinkers is
coming to the fore with herculean strides. Soon the
tides will surge over the earth to sweep away the
debris of delusion which has been strewn over the
paths of those who are struggling along under the
load of evolution.
“The work is already accomplished. Hundreds of
millions are re-released with their heart, soul, body,
and instinct free. They are the throbbing pulse of
an unborn race that is again heir to the ages. I see
them stepping across the ages, walking hand in
hand with God. Great waves of wisdom flood to­
ward them from the eternal shores of the infinite.
They dare to step forth and declare themselves a
part of eternal God, eternal Christ,—God and man
One eternally with eternal life. They dare to step
forth and declare to heaven that much that is writ-

TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
ten by man is a lie and in terrible blindness wrought.
“This new pulse-consciousness is the crest of the
wave that rests on the new race-consciousness. This
new race sees man, himself, the highest expression
on this planet, and one with God through the medi­
um of his life; and it sees that his whole supply
flows through that life itself. This race knows that
man can live consciously in a perfect universe with
perfect people, and in perfect accord with perfect
situations and conditions, with absolute assurance
that there is not an error in the great Spiritual plan
of the Cosmos.
“Man sees God as Cosmic Spirit pervading every­
thing; then with the subtleties of mind through the
thought, he does not hesitate to review the funda­
mentals that have placed him where he is and made
him that which he is. Thus he is again one with his
source. He knows that this source is the ever-silent
side of his God-mind linked consciously in thought
and amalgamated with Infinite Mind.
“This new race understands that through sun and
shadow, without the bitterness, the soul’s true quest
for Love and true Peace is the Truth of God and
man. This race does not hesitate to strip the swad­
dling clothes of delusion from the whole human
race. The gaunt specter which for ages has bound
the feet of the weak and doubling ego-man, through
his own ignorance, will be completely erased. He
finds that he has erased his every limitation through
his true selfhood, completely arisen. He has raised
himself from man, to God-man, to God.”
[63]
CHAPTER VII
A
FTER a short period of rest, as the first rays
of the sun came over the distant horizon, the
LMuni stood up and said: “With me are those
who have learned many things which the Father
sees for humanity. They see with the comprehen­
sion of that which penetrates Spirit; thus the whole
wide world comes under their vision. They see that
which humanity feels. Thus they are able to assist
humanity in fulfilling its desires. They also hear
thousands of sounds usually inaudible, like the song
of the humming bird, the sounds made by the
newly-hatched robin, the notes of the field cricket,
some of which sing at fifteen thousand vibrations a
second, and many other musical sounds far above
the range of the human ear.
“They are also able to feel, control, and send out
inaudible sounds that are capable of producing types
of emotional feelings such as love, peace, harmony,
and perfection that benefit the whole world.
“The vibrations of the feelings of abundance and
great joy can also be amplified and sent out by
them so that they surround and interpenetrate all
humanity to such an extent that, if he will, each unit
of the human family may have them. When this
condition is acknowledged to exist, each human unit
co-operates by amplifying and sending out these vi­
brations; then the very thing that humanity is in
need of, is crystallized into form around or among
its units, or people. Their desires are accomplished.
When the necessary vibrations are set into activity,
the units of humanity can not escape the actual
presence of these. In this way, all of humanity’s per­
fect desires are crystallized into actual form.
[64]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
“The vast sea of God’s creative, unlimited, mov­
ing space is crystal clear; yet it is completely full
of vibrating, emanating energy; and that emanating
energy is known as aqueous substance in which all
substance or elements are in soluble form or sus­
pended in harmonious relation, ready to respond to
file call of the vibratory rate that will allow them
to coalesce into form. When the proper vibratory
influence is set up through the thoughts of the hu­
man unit, co-operating with the whole, the elements
having no other course, rush in and fill the mould
set by the desire. This is absolute law and none can
slay its true course.
“Listen. An organ is playing in very low bass
notes. Now let us first lower these notes so that
they are no longer audible to us. The feeling or
emotion of the sound we have experienced, still
lingers, does it not? The vibration is going on just
the same, although it is inaudible. Now let us carry
these notes up and up through the scale until they
are so high that they are again inaudible. The feel­
ing or emotion still lingers; the higher vibration is
going on just the same. We know that neither of
the influences ever ceases although out of range of
our physical ear.
“This is what we designate as Spirit. When the
physical loses control, Spirit takes control; and that
control is much more definite, as it has a much
wider range of vibration than the mere physical and
is much more susceptible to the control of thought-
influences or vibrations, since thought is much more
closely allied to and co-ordinated with Spirit.
“The physical is limited to the body and does not
extend from or away from it. The physical is lim­
ited, too, entirely to the actions of the body, but
not to its reactions. When it comes to body reactions
we are Spirit, if we define it as Spirit; thus you can
[65]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
see how the physical body is limited.
“Spirit not only penetrates every atom of the so-
called physical, it also interpenetrates the minutest
part of all substance, whether it be solid or gaseous.
In fact, it is the force in which the mould is
wrought, that substance takes its various patterns
from. In no other way can substance take its vari­
ous forms. Man is the only projector, and co-ordi­
nator of these various patterns that substance as­
sumes. Allow me to digress for a brief moment of
explanation. You see the great central sun of our
universe blazing forth in all its magnificent splen­
dor; and as the horizon gradually withdraws and ex­
poses to our view a new day, a new epoch, a new
Easter is born.
“This so-called universe of ours, that ro­
tates around that central sun, is but one of ninety-
one such universes that rotate around a central sun.
This sun is ninety-one thousand times greater than
the whole or combined mass of all the ninety-one
universes. This central sun is so colossal that each
of the ninety-one universes rotating around it in
perfect order and sequence, is as small in compari­
son, as the minute particles that spin around the
central sun or nucleus of an atom, as you call it.
“It takes this universe over 26,800 years to ac­
complish one turn of its orbit around this great cen­
tral sun. It moves in exact order with one complete
procession of Polaris or the North Star. Do you
doubt there is a great positive divine power con­
trolling all? Let us return to our observations.
“Look closely. A picture is forming, and on the
film is the white globular disk of the sun. A spot of
red is forming on the white disk. Now look more
closely and you will see that a tiny point of pure
white light has flashed out from the red disk. This
is not a beam of light; it is a running point of pure
[66]
light, the spark of life, emitted and included with
that which is to be born. It is but a tiny point of
light to you; yet it is huge to those who can view it
at close range. How strange it seems to you. In a
very short space of time, you will be looking
through an instrument that assists your eyes to see
all these things. This will also reveal to humanity,
many more wonders.
“For millions of ages the great central sun has
drawn to itself the throbbing, pulsating, yet har­
monious emanations of energy which must give
forth of itself or burst asunder. Observe that a great
nebulous, gaseous mass has burst forth from the
sun. You have observed in pictures, the birth of the
planet Neptune, which is now a great mass of micro-
cosmic particles or atoms that have been ejected
from the parent sun, with great force and power.
“While it is nebulous and indistinct, the point of
light that appeared before the final expulsion took
place, is the central sun that has the power to at­
tract to itself and hold together even the minutest
particles as well as those of larger dimensions that
have been given forth from the parent sun.
“Your first thought is that an explosion has taken
place and that particles of the sun have been shot
into space. Stop a moment and observe what has
really happened. Why do the particles and gases
cling close together and form a definite circular pat­
tern? It is because of the intelligent Law back of and
guiding it, in perfect order and harmony. This is
proof that it is no accident but is in perfect order and
sequence governed by Law, Law that never fails.
“This point of light or central nucleus, is the cen­
tral spark or sun, the Christ of Humanity, around
which all humanity revolves. This is determined
Spirit force. This Law prevails throughout all units
of humanity. The central spark is a point of pure
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[67]
white light, the Christ which penetrated the first
cell. Then it expands, divides and gives of that light
to another cell, which is born of its division, but
held together by a co-existing and cohesive force
which is called LOVE.
“These particles are nourished and held together
just as the mother holds and nourishes the child.
It is in reality a child of the sun, which contains
within itself the nucleus or central sun. That nuc­
leus is the image and likeness of the parent that has
just given it forth. As soon as it has come forth
from the parent, this central sun has the same pow­
er to draw to itself, consolidate and hold the vibrant
emanating energy that surrounds it, which is neces­
sary for its life and growth. It does finally consoli­
date itself into the planet Neptune, the oldest planet
occupying the most extended orbit of our Universe.
“When Neptune first came forth and the central
sun began to draw energy to itself, mostly from its
parent, the sun, the atom began to consolidate into
its form; that is, it began to shape itself into the
pattern that was projected for it before its birth. It
occupied what is known as the cradle orbit, the orbit
within the orbit which Mercury occupies today. In
this orbit, the child is able to draw its substance
from the parent more successfully, as it is much
nearer to the parent. As it drew substance from its
parent, it began to consolidate into form. Instead of
remaining mere gaseous vapors in the nebulous
state, the chemical elements began to segregate and
consolidate. The resultant solids from chemical
action began to consolidate, and rock structure be­
gan to form, under intense heat and pressure. As
this semi-liquid substance became more consoli­
dated, it began to cool on the surface, and a crust
formed. This crust became heavier and more dense,
both by the cooling process and by the assimilation
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[68]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
of particles upon, and adding them to, the outside of
the crust. When this crust became strong enough to
hold the revolving mass together, this mass became
the primary rock structure of the planet, with a
semi-liquid molten mass at its center. Then from the
resultant gases and vapor, water began to appear as
the product of the union of these gases. The nebula
then became worthy the name of planet. It was now
fact evolving toward a condition where it could sus­
tain life; yet it must go on for eons of time, adding
to its structure, particle by particle, from the out­
side. The continued cooling of the central mass
brought it nearer and nearer to perfection, before
its atmospheric, chemical conditions and surface
were ready to bring forth life organisms and main­
tain those life organisms.
“At this juncture the parent sun began to give
birth to another atom. As this expulsion was com­
pleted, Uranus was born. The extra force emitted
with the expulsion, threw Neptune out of its cradle
or smaller orbit, into a more extended one. It was
compelled to take the orbit now occupied by Mer­
cury, to make room in the cradle orbit for the new­
born child, Uranus, in order that it might receive
its nourishment from the parent, until its nebulous
structure became a planet.
“Again conditions settle down and go well for a
long period of time. Neptune, the first child, is grow­
ing up and coming nearer to the conditions where it
can support life. In fact, amoebic forms are appear­
ing in its clouded, brackish water, or inland seas.
Then another atom is ready to come forth and
Saturn is born. The extra force given out at the time
of this expulsion, sends Uranus out of the cradle or­
bit and it also sends Neptune out of the orbit now
occupied by the planet Venus.
“Neptune was now sufficiently cooled and its sur-
[69]
face developed to a stage where it was able to sup­
port life. It was upon this planet, as it occupied this
orbit, that the conditions for the support and nour­
ishment of human life which the earth enjoys to­
day, was brought to the stage where the human life
element could attach itself to the select amoeba
necessary for the support and manifestation of the
human form.
“Thus came into existence the first human race,
not of the animal amoeba, but the human amoeba,
the amoeba of selective type and character, with in­
telligence that could and did shorten the process of
evolution. Upon this planet, conditions were per­
fect for selective human development, and this de­
velopment came on at a rapid pace.
“There were no lower animal organisms; thus
animal life did not develop. The planet was occu­
pied by superior human beings who rapidly devel­
oped into a perfect human race who were all able to
supply and support themselves directly from Cosmic
or Aqueous substance. Thus they would have been
termed gods upon this earth. Many of the legends
and myths of today have their inception in and are
built around this great people. They were exactly
like the principle that brought them into existence.
This race through their ability to express beauty
and perfection, began to surround themselves with
perfect and beautiful conditions; in fact, they built
the planet into a paradise of beauty and perfection.
“It was intended that this race should forever
maintain this perfect condition which they had ac­
complished by absolute control of all the elements.
Thus, when they put forth a desire, it was fulfilled
instantly.
“As time moved on, some began to evidence in­
activity, and selfishness in attempting to outdo their
fellowman. This condition brought on divisions, and
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[70]
divisions brought on selfishness and greed which
caused dissensions. The time that should have been
spent in creating for service and advancement, was
dissipated in strife and contention. Instead of hold­
ing closely to their source, they were differing and
separating widely, until all but a few lost that which
was high and noble. All hut a few let go of their
security and protection. This caused a vortex to
gather around the planet.
“Instead of holding to the perfect pattern of the
divine, whereby they could have accomplished a
complete universe of divine attributes upon divine
planets, they gave way to such an extent that when
the next outburst occured, it was so enormous, that
when the nebula was consolidated the resulting
planet was larger in mass than all of those which
had previously come forth. Thus the great planet
Jupiter came forth. The excess energy given out was
so gigantic, that it swept Saturn out of the cradle
orbit into the orbit now occupied by Mercury. The
outburst was so tremendous and the solar system
so filled, that great quantities of asteroids formed,
arrayed and aligned themselves around Saturn. Be­
ing of a different polarity, they could not coalesce
with Saturn; thus they were independent and their
only alternative was to align themselves around the
planet of Saturn as bands of asteroids. As such they
are commonly called the rings of Saturn. Some of
these asteroids are as large as planets.
“The force swept Neptune, the great and beauti­
ful, out into the orbit now occupied by the Earth.
All of its magnificence, with its great inhabitants,
save a few, were swept away. Those who were pre­
served had never let go of their divine heritage, and
they had so constituted their bodies that they could
seek safety in the emanations of the Spirit Sphere,
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[71]
which is all around and interpenetrates the ninety-
one universes now in existence.
“In this condition they have been able to preserve
their identity and knowledge and give it out, so
that it will never pass out of existence. It is through
and by these ideals that we live today. We claim
kinship with these great ones. They compose the
root race of humanity. By them the ideals of hu­
manity have been preserved, and the Godhead of
man has been maintained.
“Then followed many millions of eons of time
needed for the nebula of Jupiter to take form as a
planet. So enormous is its size that it has cooled but
little even today.
“Time again passes on with swift wings and the
sun is ready to give birth to the fifth nebula; and
Mars, the blood-red planet, is brought into existence.
As this expulsion is complete, we see a phenomenon
happening to mighty Jupiter. A huge red spot has
suddenly developed on her side and she is expelling
a great portion of herself; she has given birth to a
satellite which is called a moon. There is such an
excess of force set up as the two expulsions take
place that the giant Jupiter is thrown out of the
cradle orbit and room is made for the planet Mars.
“As the giant Jupiter occupies its new orbit, the
whirling nebulous form is in no way able to gather
to itself the great mass of particles that were ex­
pelled at the time of its birth. These particles were
so far flung that they came within the influence of
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Mars; but being of a
different polarity, they could not be assimilated by
those planets. They became separate asteroids with­
out planetary polarity; thus they cannot take their
place as planets, and rotate in order and unison
around the central sun. Consequently, they fly into
space, as vast swarms of meteors, with no rhythm
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[72]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
of movement, speeding with fearful velocity, to col­
lide with and imbed themselves in the surface of
other planets, or be torn to pieces through the im­
pact of collision.
“Also in their mad rush through space, minute
particles are carried away, until they will gradually
return to the aqueous mass, where they can be again
taken up and assimilated by the great central sun,
to be given off again as nebulae, at the birth of
other planets or atoms.
“Now comes the outburst that gives birth to the
nebula that finally forms our Earth. Mars is thrown
out of the cradle orbit and our Earth takes its place.
Thus all of the planets are sent out into another
orbit, to give space for the new child. Then Venus
is born. In like manner the Earth and all other
planets or atoms are thrown into ever-expanding
orbits in order to make room in the cradle for the
new-born planet or atom. Then Mercury is born,
throwing the other planets or atoms into another
widened orbit, making up the full complement of
planets that are visible through astronomy today,
eight in all.
“There are really nine, as the cradle orbit is not
occupied by Mercury. It is occupied by the last
nebula or child, but that nebula has not consolidated
into form so that it can be seen. It is there neverthe­
less, and its influence is felt. Thus the universe that
our earth is a part of, contains nine planets, or
atoms, with their nine orbits, which they follow in
mathematical precision around the central sun or
nucleus. You have been shown pictures of this crea­
tion as it came into being, through orderly sequence.
“Something is happening to Neptune, the farthest
removed planet from the sun, with the greatest
orbit. It has reached maturity and also its limit in
velocity. It has received its full light charge and is
[73]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
ready to come forth as a sun. It is going into decline
as the new nebula begins to take form and the sun
is ready to give birth to the tenth nebula. Before
this expulsion takes place. Neptune has reached its
limiting velocity in its spin around the central sun;
it flies into space and explodes, then returns again
to the aqueous. There it can again be taken up by
the central sun, to add more energy to that sun, in
order that more planets or atoms may come forth.
“In the universe of which our earth is a part,
there can be but nine planets or particles spinning
around the central sun at one time. Thus it is a con­
stant round of birth, consolidation, then expansion,
reaching the limiting velocity, flying off into space,
exploding, disintegrating, then reassimilating by the
sun in order to give forth new birth.
“Thus the sun is reassembling from the aqueous,
that which it sends out to again become aqueous. It
is a continuous renewal through regeneration into
new birth. Were it not for this process, the great
central sun of the ninety-nine universes, as well as
the central suns of the different universes, would
have been consumed long ago and all would have re­
turned to the Infinite in which all substances exist.
“A wise intelligence that pervades all emanations
and space, calls the universes into form and starts
them on their onward march. The sun or central
nucleus, never grows old nor dies. It accepts, ab­
sorbs, holds and consolidates, then gives birth to the
atom; yet it never diminishes, as it is forever receiv­
ing and absorbing unto itself, that which it is givng
out. Thus regeneration and rebirth is going on all
the time. Universes are being formed, expanding,
and returning that which they have received. There
is one round of progression from a lower to a
higher, then on to a higher attainment.
“The galaxy of ninety-one universes that our earth
[74]
and its galaxy of planets or atoms is one part of, is
but one galaxy in a still wider-flung universe of
ninety-one galaxies, that revolve around a still great­
er central nucleus or sun that has a mass ninety-one
thousand times greater than the first galaxy men­
tioned. This condition goes on and repeats itself by
ninety-one, almost indefinitely; the whole making
up the great and infinite Cosmos, the galaxies that
comprise the Milky Way, as you call it. This Cosmos
is often called ‘the Atomic Heat Ray,’ the source of
the sun’s heat.
“This is not a cloud of stars in which your sun
belongs. It is a nebula born or expelled from the
great cosmic central sun or nucleus just mentioned.
The sun, as you see it located in this nebula, is but
a portion of the light rays from the sun; these par­
ticular rays are bent at an angle as they enter mass,
then are reflected, until these bent and distorted rays
make up the image of the sun and place it in a false
position. These rays are reflected back so distinctly
that you think you are actually looking at the sun.
In like manner, many other planets or atoms are
distorted by this phenomenon. Where there seem
many, there are a few in comparison; yet the total
number of the actual is calculated in many millions.
“By looking at the picture closely, you will see
that these nebulae or their suns are not disks but
globular and round, flattened at the poles just as our
earth is flattened. In looking at them, you are only
observing the great flattened polar area.
“The stupendous mass of the great Cosmic sun
exerts so profound an effect upon light rays that
they are reflected completely around the Cosmos.
They are also definitely affected and reflected by
coming in contact with the Atomic or Cosmic rays
and their particles are thrown out of place to such
an extent that thousands of images of planets and
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[75]
stars are reflected from one collection. Thus thous­
ands of planets and stars appear to be misplaced
and many more thousands of the images are again
reflected. When we look through the universe the
images show both sides and we see the light that
was released hundreds of millions of years before,
which has made the complete round of the Cosmos.
Thus we get two images instead of one.
“One image is of the planet as it was hundreds of
thousands of years ago, while the other is as it was
hundreds of millions of years ago. This follows
through the whole great Cosmic order. In many in­
stances we are actually looking at the great past and
we can also see into the future by the same means.
“There is in invisible connection, like the thought
or heart impulse amplified billions of cycles,
through which spiritual orders go forth, that con­
trols all of the universes. These great throbbing im­
pulses or heart throbs, go out through the intelli­
gence which pervades the Aqueous, that surrounds
the Cosmos which is its spiritual counterpart. It is
these gigantic heart throbs that send the life cur­
rents into every atom of the complete Cosmos and
keep them moving in perfect order and rhythm. In
this infinite Cosmos vastness, there can be no sick
or discordant cells, as one sick or discordant cell
would throw all out of unison. Then for a time
chaos would result. This also pertains to the human
organism when disturbed by discordant thought.
“It was from this central control that the term
‘Godhead’ was evolved. The heartbeat of the human
unit corresponds to this heart throb, although in
miniature.
“Man is from, and is a counterpart of, the intel­
ligence which has control of the whole aqueous
source. He is co-existent with the source and draws
all direct from that great aqueous reservoir, just as
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
(76]
the great central sun draws from that source; but in
greater degree because of his union with the greater
intelligence which is directing the source.
“Man, the unit of humanity, is a well-organized
divine universe, though infinitesimal compared with
the great whole of the universes. Yet man, as the
unit of humanity, when he asumes and takes actual
charge of his divinity, is most necessary; as he is of
the great intelligence that is before and in control of
the whole divine plan of all the universes. Thus,
should all the universes be destroyed, man, in com­
plete co-operation with primal intelligence which
interpenetrates and pervades all emanations in the
Aqueous as well as down to the lowliest physical
forms, starting with light emanation, could rebuild
all the universes. Should such a catastrophe occur,
man not only has the power, but is the power that
does resolve himself back into primal intelligence
wherein there is no destruction. When quiet again
reigns and harmony is restored, it matters not to
man, when he is back into primal intelligence, how
many billions of ages pass to bring about primal
perfection in order that the whole process may be
started over again. Here man maintains oneness
with infinity and can afford to wait until the time is
ripe for the bringing forth of the universes. Then
with the preserved consciousness of former experi­
ences, he is better equipped to assist in the bringing
forth of a more perfect and lasting condition. In
this, man can never fail, as he is more definite than
any form; and failure is not written in his horizon
or in his consciousness.
“The infinitesimal becomes the infinite of all
forms. When the wise sage says: ‘I am deathless,
ageless, eternal; there is not a thing in Life or light
that I am not,’ he is looking into and sees this vista.
This is true divinity. The ascension is truly his.”
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[77]
CHAPTER VIII
W
HEN the speaker closed, we realized that the
sun was well past the meridian. We sat there,
not spellbound, but enraptured, as we were
actually enclosed in the vista that had been set
before us.
Where had the horizon gone? We had dropped
it entirely; we were in and of infinity. The infinite
was ours for the reaching out and acceptance of it.
Do you wonder? Could we grasp the magnitude of
who we were, where we were, and the importance
of our place in the great plan of the Cosmos? Not
yet, dear friends, not yet. Would the world accept
it? We did not know. We had looked into the long,
long past; what the future portends we know not
until we have proved it by actually living the pres­
ent. What the past has been for millions of years,
we have seen.
We will look forward toward this accomplish­
ment, knowing that the future extends as many mil­
lions of years as has been portrayed before us. We
have dropped our old beliefs, forgiven them en­
tirely; and we look forward to every accomplish­
ment, not hopefully, but knowingly. The old beliefs,
where are they? Gone, dispelled like a mist. The
Cosmos stands forth, crystal clear.
We were aware that the sun was shining but there
was a crystal brightness back of the sunlight that
the sun seemed to darken.
We collected our notes and moved toward the en­
trance of our sanctuary. As we projected the im­
pulse to take the step, we were traveling on beams
of'light rays. Thus we entered the room; yet there
were no limiting walls. The Cosmos still enraptured
and enthralled us. Could it be that we were an
[78]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
intricate part of this giganticity? The gigantic lies
prostrate before the grandeur of the surroundings.
We sat down and allowed the silence completely
to immerse us. Not a word was spoken. We were
not even conscious of the passing of time until
someone announced that the table was spread. The
meal was of keen momentary pleasure, but the key­
note of our whole lives was the hours that had just
passed. The sun had again reached the horizon and
was fast disappearing as we arose from the table
and walked out upon the ledge.
What a vista lay before us! It was not sunset; it
was eternity, just a brief chapter being enacted for
us, and here were our dear friends living with it
chapter by chapter. Do you wonder that their lives
are immortal? Do you wonder that we called them
Masters? Yet not a hint of this ever passed their
lips. We asked, “May we call you Masters?” Their
answer was, “Sons, we are but yourselves.” O, the
beauty, the simplicity. Why can we not be as beau­
tifully humble!
As we were preparing to leave the ledge, instead
of going down the stairs as we anticipated, we
walked to the brink. No sooner had we reached the
edge than we were all in the garden of the lodge.
Not one of our party was conscious of what had
taken place. We were not cognizant of going
through the air or of any movement at all. By this
time, we were so accustomed to surprises that we
simply accepted the situation.
From the garden, we walked to the village and
found that all was in readiness for an early start
and that a number of the villagers had left to break
trail through the snow that still blanketed the moun­
tain pass to a depth of ten or twelve feet. This pass
was about fifty miles from the village at an eleva­
tion of twelve thousand feet above sea level.
[79]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
A large portion of the country is rugged and very
difficult to travel over. It is the custom to pack the
trail through the snow the day previous to its use so
that the packed snow will freeze, thus supporting
men and animals.
We arose long before dawn to find that every de­
tail had been attended to. Jast and the muni were
to accompany us. The entire village had assembled
to bid us Godspeed. We all regretted the necessity
of leaving this village where we had spent two win­
ters. We had formed a deep attachment for every
one of the people there and knew that this feeling
was reciprocated. They were simple, kindly folks.
In order to show their appreciation, many went
with us five or six miles. We exchanged our last
farewells and were again on our way to India. Be­
fore we were actually to look down upon the south­
ern slopes of the Himalayas, months would have
elapsed.
As we walked along with the main body of the
caravan, we became conscious that we were walking
without effort. At times we seemed to see some
point on the trail ahead, like a vision; the instant the
point became definite, we were there, sometimes
miles ahead of the main caravan.
At the noon hour, we found fires going and a
meal prepared by three of the villagers who had
stopped for this purpose. After lunch they returned
to the village. We were told that the others had pre­
ceded us so that the trail through the snow over the
summit would be easy to walk upon. Our camp was
also ready for occupancy. All was prepared for us
until we had crossed the pass and came down into
the valley of Giama-nu-chu River; there we over­
took the advance party of villagers. They had gone
to all this trouble in order that we might be assured
safe conduct through the rugged mountainous coun-
[80]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
try. They left us here, as travel was easy through
the valley.
I am purposely introducing this brief description
to show, in a general way, the hospitality of these
simple, kindly people throughout the whole trip to
Lhasa. Seldom did we meet the cruel, austere na­
tive of Tibet that so many travelers love to write
about.
We followed down the valley of the Giama-nu-
chu, then up a tributary of that stream to the great
Tonjnor Jung pass, thence down the tributary of the
Tsan-Pu or Brahmaputra to Lhasa, where, a wel­
come awaited us.
When we came within sight of the city, we felt
we were nearing a Taos Pueblo. One could imagine
oneself standing before such a Pueblo as we looked
around on all sides. The palace of the great Dalai
Lama or overlord of all Tibet, stands out as the one
great jewel of the whole city. While this city is the
temporal head of Tibet, the deeper spiritual head is
the Living Buddha. He is supposed to rule spirit­
ually through the mysterious hidden city or center
called Shamballa, the celestial. To visit this sacred
place was one of our fondest hopes. It is supposed
to be buried deep under the sands of the Gobi.
We entered the city, accompanied by our escort,
and were conducted to our lodgings where our com­
fort had been provided for. A great crowd stood
around outside for hours to get a look at us, as
white people had seldom visited the city.
We were invited to go to the Monastery the next
morning at ten and were told that we. must make
our every wish known, as all would deem it a spe­
cial pleasure to serve us. We had an escort wher­
ever we went; and a guard was stationed at our door
to keep out the curious, as the inhabitants of Lhasa
are accustomed to walk into each other’s homes un-
[81]
announced. We were the only diversion in their
lives and could not blame them for their expressions
of curiosity. If one of us went out alone they would
crowd around with the evident intention of finding
out whether or not we were real, and sometimes this
inspection proved rather disconcerting for the re­
cipient of the inspection.
The next morning we were up early, completely
refreshed and prepared to go to the Monastery to
meet the High Priest who had preceded us only two
days. As we left the city with our guard, it looked
as if all of the inhabitants had turned out to do us
honor.
As we approached the Monastery, the High Priest
came out to meet us; and to our surprise, Emil and
his mother were with him.
It was a wonderful meeting. The Priest seemed
like a boy again, saying that he had wanted to see
Emil or some one of our friends. He felt that he
had failed in many things and wanted to talk to
them in order to get a more complete under­
standing.
He also gave us our first news of the little home
that had been erected in the village where he had
charge. We found him speaking English fluently
and very anxious to learn. We went to the Lama­
sery where all were made comfortable. Turning to
Emil’s mother the Priest said:
“Power is the demonstration of the active Prin­
ciple of God, my Father. It is always the construc­
tive activity. There is never too much or too little
of God’s perfect activity and manifestation; and God
never fails, is never inactive. God Principle is al­
ways working constructively. I command that I do
stand forth, and that I am in perfect harmony with
the active God Principle, and that alone.”
Here Emil’s mother took up the thought; “You
[82]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
can go on still further and say just as definitely, ‘I
pour this divine flame through you, my physical
body, and you are transmuted into that pure sub­
stance which, only, God Principle sees.’
“Now it becomes necessary for you to accept and
expand your consciousness to the God conscious­
ness; and you, yourself, revel in God. You do actu­
ally become God, one with the Most High. Man be­
longs in this high estate. Here man is one with the
essence of all things; he is truly God. Here no divi­
sion can exist. Do you not see that man himself can
become God or demon? Can you not see that man’s
true vibratory sphere is the whole vibratory sphere
of God if he lives in that sphere? This is the only
scientific sphere, the only place for man, and the
only place where he can bring forth God and be one
with God. Such a man is certainly more than the
human concept of man.
“Do you not see then, that you belong to, and are
of, God’s Kingdom and not that of any demon which
is created by man’s own imaging faculty? Then is
it not a perfectly scientific and logical fact that man
is and can be God, or that he may image himself out
of the God Kingdom and therefore create for him­
self, a demoniacal realm which may seem real to
him? I leave you to be the judge.
“This is the only issue upon which humanity
stands or falls.
“There is but one choice, one purpose, one truth,
and one science; and this makes you free. You be­
come God or servants, as you choose.
“Stop for a moment and just think of the allness
of God or Primal Cause, with no beginning or end,
with universal scope, and surround yourself in this.
As you become faithful and worship this, and this
alone, ONE GOD, ONE ALMIGHTY PRESENCE—
you will find that the vibrations of your body will
[83]
change from the human to the God or Primal vibra­
tion. As you think, live, move, and become one with
this vibration, you do worship; and what you wor­
ship, you idealize, you become. It is thus with and
for all humanity. There is but one God, one Christ,
One Union, One man; One general household, all
brothers and sisters, all One.
“God cannot be brought forth as a person or a
personal image, but as an all-inclusive universality,
interpenetrating all things. The moment you per­
sonalize, you idolize. Then you have the empty
idol; you have lost the ideal. This ideal is not a dead
savior or a dead God. To make God alive and vital
to you, you must think and know that you are God.
This is more living and vital to you than anything.
This is the divine science of your being. Then you,
the Christ, your redeemer, becomes alive and one
with you. You are that very thing. This becomes
the motivating force of your whole life. You are
redeeming yourself, the true you; you are one with
God, truly God. By reverencing, loving, and wor­
shipping this, it becomes ideal to you, God right
within and active.”
Here the talk drifted to the possibility of going to
Shamballa. The priest asked whether it would be
possible for him to go. He was told that if he could
lay aside the body and reassemble it again, he could
go without difficulty and that the party would go
that evening. It was arranged that they should
meet at our lodge early in the evening and that our
Chief should go with them. The party assembled
shortly after our return. After a short talk, they left
by the door and we did not see them again for a
number of days.
During this time we were occupied in making
measured drawings in the Monastery. One day we
were rummaging in one of the basements of the old
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[84]
Lamasery. After moving considerable debris, we
came upon an old marble tablet. This we had car­
ried out of doors and cleaned. When the cleansing
was finished the beauty of the carving and the ex­
actness of the execution of detail surprised every
one. It even surprised the Lamas themselves.
An old Lama told us that when he was a very
young boy, he became a chela of one of the Grand
Lamas who was in charge of the very old Lamasery
at the time this table reposed in a niche in the wall,
and that his master insisted they visit this tablet the
first Monday in each month at the hour of nine in
the morning. He told us that as soon as they ar­
rived at the niche where the tablet was placed, and
stood quiet for three or four minutes, a voice would
sing the history of this tablet and the great things
that the carvings portrayed.
The song claimed that the tablet was one of two
that were carved to commemorate a great white
civilization that had existed and flourished on a
large portion of what is known as the American
Continent, hundreds of thousands of years ago. The
duplicate, or sister tablet, the song claimed, was in
existence, and could be found in the motherland of
its creation, thus proving that such a land did exist.
We took the data as interpreted by the song. After
the lapse of several years, we were working in the
district described and found the twin or mate tablet
embedded in a great wall at the location claimed in
the song. The walls proved to have been the walls
of an old temple in Central America now in ruins.
Thus it is seen how through legend and song, direct
truths are brought to light.
The interest we showed in the tablet and the leg­
end repeated in the song, gave us access to other
records and data that were of invaluable assistance
in our research work later. This incident was also
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[85]
the contributing factor that opened the doors to
records that are in the Palace of the Dalai Lama,
the Living Buddha, as well as those in the Monas­
tery, which have been guarded for hundreds of cen­
turies. Many of these records and their importance
were wholly unknown to those that guarded them. It
was through legend in song that we were attracted
to them, although with the exception of these tab­
lets, they proved to be copies. These copies were
carefully done, and they pointed the way to the
originals later on.
Detailed descriptions of these records and the in­
stance cannot be included in this volume, as space
will not permit. These can only be included in
treatises that will follow in book form later.
We were so completely engrossed in this work
that we were unaware our friends and Chief had
extended their stay. This we thought very little of,
as unforeseen conditions can arise in this remote
country, to cause delays beyond our control. Dur­
ing this time the inhabitants had in a measure be­
come accustomed to us, and we had adjusted our­
selves to their ways and means.
Curiosity had given way to friendliness on both
sides and we were going about freely. The morn­
ing of the twelfth day, as we were preparing to go
to the Monastery, we heard a commotion outside,
and stepping out to investigate, we found that our
friends had returned. Their trip had been success­
ful and such a place as Shamballa did exist. We
were told that much of the beauty and grandeur of
its art and culture were still preserved in its original
beauty and that its magnificence was beyond com­
parison.

[86]
CHAPTER IX
A
T NOON of the next day, word was sent that the
great Dalai Lama would receive us at the Pal-
L ace. The High Priest came to our lodge that
evening to instruct us in regard to the ceremonies.
He was overjoyed that the audience had been grant­
ed without the usual delays. He told us that this
privilege had been granted immediately upon the
arrival of a messenger from Shamballa who had in­
formed His Highness of the visit that had just been
completed. He had also been informed of our ex­
periences in the village where the little house had
been erected.
We were anxious to make as good an impression
as possible, as we were asking for concessions to
carry on our work in the whole country. We were
also told that the Bogodo Lama or Governor of the
province would arrive before noon and had sent
word by messenger that he would assist us all he
could. This was a surprise indeed. It was quite evi­
dent that the next day would be an eventful one
for our little party. We were up early and out with
the reception party to meet the Governor.
He was very much pleased at this gesture and in­
vited us to return with him as his guests. We ac­
cepted the invitation and when we arrived with the
Governor, we were escorted to the guest chambers
of the Palace. From there we went directly to the
place where the first ceremonies were to be con­
ducted preparatory to our being received at the
Palace.
When we arrived, three Lamas sat enthroned on
high carpeted chairs while others, of lesser rank, sat
in the posture of Samadhi, upon the floor. Two
Lamas in red plaited cloaks stood on high stools and
[87]
led the incantations. Our friend, the High Priest or
Abbot, sat on a throne shaded by a ceremonial um­
brella, awaiting the Governor.
The great- courtyard in the Lamasery yamen was
most beautifully decorated for the occasion. The
decorations represented scenes that took place in
1417. In these scenes Tsongkappa appeared on the
stone altar of his Monastery. After addressing the
multitude on the greatness of man’s accomplish­
ments, he became transfigured and disappeared
with his body. He then returned and founded the
Yellow Order or Reformed Established Church of
Tibet, of which Lhasa is the central hub.
In a few moments the Governor entered with his
escort and advanced directly to the throne from
which the Abbot had descended. They stood to­
gether to receive and conduct us to the audience
chamber of the Dalai Lama. The great hall was
decorated with gorgeous silk applique tapestries and
yellow lacquered furniture.
Led by our escort, we knelt before His Highness
for a moment, then arose and were conducted to
seats. The Abbot acting as spokesman, stated the
object of our visit. His Highness arose and beckoned
us to approach. An assistant conducted us to our
respective places before the throng. The Abbot and
the Governor took their places at each end of the
line, His Highness then descending from the throne
and standing before us. He received a sceptre from
the hands of one of the attendants and walking be­
fore us, touched each one lightly on the forehead
with the wand. With the High Priest acting as in­
terpreter, he bade us welcome to Tibet, saying he
was honored that we were his guests while in the
city, and that we should consider ourselves the
honor guests of his country and people as long as
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[88]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
we might remain and at any time when we should
return to the country.
We asked many questions and were told that we
should have his answer the next day. We were in­
vited to inspect the records and tablets in the vaults
of the palace. He called an attendant and gave sev­
eral orders which were not translated for us, but we
were informed that we were to have the liberty of
the palace without restraint. His Highness gave us
his blessing, and after a hearty handshake all
around we were conducted to our quarters, accom­
panied by the Abbot and the Governor. They
asked if they might come in, as they had many
things to talk over.
The Priest began by saying: “We have had many
remarkable things happen to us since you were
with us in the little village. We have been looking
over some of the tablets that are in our monastery
and find they all refer to the older civilization that
inhabited the Gobi. It is our thought that all civi­
lizations and religious beliefs came from one
source, and while we do not know the origin or
date of the records, we are well satisfied that they
are the thoughts of a people which lived many
thousands of years ago. We have here a short syn­
opsis of a translation that was made for us by a
wandering Lama of the Kisu Abu, and with your
permission I will read it.
“We are fully aware of the fact that our religious
thoughts of today originated about five thousand
years ago, and that they are only an admixture so to
speak, of the thoughts and beliefs of men who lived
at that time. Some are myths, others are legends,
and some are purely inspirational in character; yet
none of them point to the highest possible attain­
ment outlined, of the Christ of God being a part of
the individual attainment, and the possibilities of
[89]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
attaining that goal through living a life that pre­
sents that ideal. How has it been possible for us to
have escaped these things when they have been so
long in our midst? I can readily see now that
Buddha and all of the great and illumined ones,
taught thus; but how have we escaped the true im­
port of their teachings for so long, living so near
to them?
“We know that our beloved Tsongkappa attained
to this degree by the life he lived. I know that oth­
ers and the dear one you met today have gone far
toward this accomplishment. I have seen him go
and come at will; yet the people are priest-ridden,
down-trodden and miserable. Why is it that these
things are submerged? Why are the people not
taught to operate the great and only law, standing
forth as that law? I can see that in this earlier
civilization, each individual did actuallv know, abide
by, and live, one with this law, this perfect condition.
Any other manifestation depends wholly upon man
and is the result of the ignorance of the law of per­
fection. It cannot be that this law is not thor­
oughly enough consolidated to be given to the whole
human family; if this were true, it would not be
law, but a division of law which puts it back into
nothing but a manifestation of law. Anything that
is only a portion of a whole is but a manifestation
of the whole, taken away from and consolidated
unto itself, until it becomes an isolated atom with
no polarity or connection with its source. Yet it
flies around in space with a seeming orbit, only
seeking, as it has no constituted orbit of its own.
It only assumes the orbit of its source but never
becomes one with the source.
“There are thousands of examples of this phe­
nomenon today in our solar system, especially in
regions between Jupiter and Mars. In this region,
[90]
thousands of smaller bodies exist that seem to be
related to the sun, as they follow a seeming path
around the sun. They are only following the orbit
of their parent Jupiter because of its attraction for
them and their lack of polarity to the sun, their
real source. They were expelled when Jupiter was
expelled. They were never consolidated with Ju­
piter; still, they fly on and on with Jupiter, ignoring
completely the sun, their real source. This we know
conclusively is because of the lack of central polar­
ization within themselves to the sun, their true
source. Is Jupiter at fault in this case? Is the sun,
the true parent, at fault; or is each tiny atom at
fault? Is it not the same with humanity? Is the
Father at fault? Is the fault with those who have
the greater understanding, or is the fault with those
who have the lesser units of understanding? The
fault must lie wholly within the lesser, as they re­
fuse to become one with the greater.”
Then turning to Emil, he said: “I can see since
meeting you that it was wholly my fault that I clung
to the lesser when the greater enveloped me wholly.
But let us turn to the translation, as it is through
this that I came to the vital turning point in my
life.
“The Great Cause, or Directive Principle, saw his
son the Christ, the perfect man. He said, ‘This is
the Lord God, the Law of My Being to whom I have
given dominion over heaven and earth and all that
in them is; and this perfect One need not be in bond­
age to any mortal concept, as my Perfect Ideal is
raised above any bondage and has the same power
and dominion that I have. Thus I speak through the
Lord God of my Being.
“ ‘It is not any command that I give unto you, ex­
cept if you co-operate with Me in the Divine Crea­
tive Will, you will have need for no other and you
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[91]
will set up no graven image before Me or yourself.
Thus you will not call images gods; but you will
know that you are God in whom I am well pleased,
and you have the same dominion that I have. Now
come close up to me, my son; amalgamate with me,
and I Am yourself, and together we are God. Your
body is the God-body which is idealized and which
is in existence and was in existence before the hu­
man race was ever projected into form. This is
humanity’s being, God creation. All humanity has
this perfect form and image if they will but accept
this true image. This is the temple of God that be­
longs to man and is complete for man.
“You will not make any graven image or any
likeness that is in heaven or earth or in the waters
of the earth. You will not make any substance into
any image or idol; for all creative substance is yours
to use, pressed out to you in fullest measure. You
will not bow down to any created things nor will
you serve them; and thus there will not be any
jealous thing, nor will there be any sin or any in­
iquity that may be visited upon any of your chil­
dren unto any generation; for you will stand stead­
fast with your eyes always fixed upon the cause,
and therefore your ideal of that cause cannot di­
minish. Thus you will show forth the same love
that I manifest for you.
“ ‘You will honor this Cause or Directive Principle,
knowing that it is your Father and Mother and
your days will be greater than the grains of sand
upon the seashore which are without number.
“ ‘You will not wish to hurt or destroy or kill,
for the creatures are your creations; they are your
sons, your brothers, and you will love them as I
do you.
“You will not commit adultery, as whatever you
will have done unto these you will have done unto
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[92]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
your father, your mother, your brother, your sister,
or your loved one; for they are loved of the Cause
as the Cause loves you.
“ ‘You will not steal, for you but steal from the
Cause; and if you steal from the Cause, you but
steal from yourself.
“ ‘You will not bear false witness against any cre­
ation, for in so doing, you bear false witness against
the Cause which is yourself.
“ ‘You will not covet anything, for in so doing,
you but covet the Cause which is yourself; by hold­
ing yourself one with the Cause, you have that
which is perfect and is truly yours.
“ ‘Thus you will not make images of silver or
gold to worship as gods, but seeing yourself as one
with all things pure, you are always pure.
“ ‘Then you will not fear, for no God, save your­
self will come to prove you; as you will know that
the Cause—not personal but impersonal— is for all
and fully envelops all.
“ ‘Then you will erect an altar, and on that altar
you will build and always keep burning the undying
fire, not of gods, but of the Directive Principle
which is God. You behold yourself, the Christ, the
perfect, the only begotten of the True Principle or
Cause.
“ ‘Knowing this fully, you may speak forth the
word (GOD) and that word becomes visible. You
are the creation and the Creator, around, above, be­
low, within, One with the Divine Directive Prin­
ciple-Cause, GOD.
“ ‘The heavens obey God’s voice, the silent voice
of GOD speaking through man. God speaks. Man
speaks. God always speaks through man. Thus
when man speaks, God speaks.’”
The Priest resumed: “In connection with this I
have worked out the following, which has given me
[93]
a more definite outlook. This has also shown me
that I must be definite in every thought, word, and
deed and that I must live one with this definite prin­
ciple. First picturing, in thought, word, and deed, I
find I am actually that very thing. I have taken the
form of the ideal I have expressed.
“During the darkest hour I know that God is.
During the times that I am afraid, I trust more defi­
nitely in God, my Father, right within. I rest quietly
in this assurance, knowing fully that all is well and
that my perfection is complete and finished now.
“I recognize God as the all-inclusive mind, my
Father, and I know fully that man is the Christ of
God, the image and likeness of God, my Father; the
source and I are ONE.
“Slowly but surely the day of absolute spiritual
vision approaches. It is here the moment I recog­
nize it. It is here now, full and complete. I praise
and bless the absolute spiritual vision. I thank you,
Father, that it is fulfilling my highest ideal now.
“In working, I must always be conscious that I
am working in accord with God’s conscious and
never-failing law.
“I now understand the words, ‘My peace I give
unto you, my love I give unto you, not as the world
giveth, give I unto you.’
“I also know the meaning of ‘Build me a temple
within, that I AM may dwell therein among you.’
Then I AM is your God and you are as I AM. This
does not refer to any church or church organization.
It is the true temple of peace within man, where
God, the source of all things, actually dwells. Man­
kind builded a tabernacle in which they could come
together to worship the true ideal, the I AM, with­
in, this inner temple, which God and man hold for
all. The tabernacle was soon worshipped, the empty
idol created, the church as it exists today.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[94]
“When I hold to the true ideal, I hear my own
inner God-voice; and the revelation of that voice
supplies comfort, inspiration, and guidance in my
work in life. Even when two or three are gathered
together in my name, there I AM is always in the
midst of them. How true are these words, for I AM
is always within man.
“If I wish to progress, I must work and stick to it,
—never falter nor be cast down. I am the Christ,
the ideal of God, in whom the Father is well
pleased, the only begotten of God, the Father.
“I am the only one who knows, sees, and co-oper­
ates with the Father; the only offspring that God
knows—and God knows all—for all can claim; ‘IT
IS FINISHED!” ’

CHAPTER X
T
HE next morning as we were waiting for the
Abbot, a messenger announced that we were
expected to appear before the Dalai Lama at
two o’clock that afternoon. Thereupon we went in
search of the Abbot and located him as he was leav­
ing the audience chamber.
His face was beaming, as he held in his hand our
commission to enter the country at will. After read­
ing the order which the messenger had brought U9,
he said, “This is not an order; it is only a request.
The audience is called to confer upon you this com­
mission.” As we were all together, it was suggested
that we go immediately to see the records. We pro­
ceeded thence in a group.
Upon our arrival a great surprise awaited us.
There were thousands of clay tablets and records on
copper and bronze plates, also beautifully carved
tablets of thin white marble. As this was our first
opportunity to contact this class of record, we de­
cided to look them over at once.
The Abbot told us he was not familiar with the
tablets, but had been told that they were of Persian
origin and that he would attempt to find a Lama
who was familiar with them. Thereupon he de­
parted and we began to look them over. The char­
acters were not familiar to any of our party.
The tablets were made of two slabs of pure white
marble about one quarter of an inch thick, put to­
gether like veneer with a cement that we could not
identify. The edges were beautifully beveled, and
around each tablet was a margin of two inches with
carved raised figures. Many of these figures were of
pure gold inlay, while all the titles were of pure gold
inlay but not raised. The tablets were carefully
[96]
numbered by sets and a serial number given to each
set. The dates were represented by wreaths of flow­
ers intertwined with vines and leaves. If we were to
record a date like January 1, 1894, the first month
of the year would be represented by the stem of a
flower not yet come into bud, inlaid with pure jade.
The first day of the month would be represented by
the stem just coming into bud, inlaid with gold. The
1 of the 18, would be represented by the stem with
the bud just opened enough to disclose the pistil of
the flower. The petals of the flower are lapis lazuli
inlay; the pistil being gold inlay with a small dia­
mond set in gold.
The 8 is the flower in full bloom with eight sta­
mens showing, each stamen an inlay of gold around
the pistil, with a smaller diamond set in the gold
inlay.
The 9 is represented by a rose with nine petals in
full bloom, one petal an inlay of lapis lazuli, one of
jade, and one of chalcedony; this order repeated
three times. This shows that the last or end of the
digits was reached. Thus they used from 0 to 9,
then repeated.
The 4 is a lily in the process of opening, with the
pistil and three stamens showing. The bowl of the
lily is an inlay of pale jade; the stamens are fire
opal set with four small diamonds; and the pistil is
of lapis lazuli inlay, set with four small diamonds.
The space given over to the text is outlined with a
threadlike vine, inlaid with gold, the leaves being in­
lays of green jade, and everything being worked out
in perfect detail. Every tablet is a perfect jewel in
itself. The type of tablet and the method of dating,
would indicate early Atlantean. Each tablet would be
worth a king’s ransom, were they offered for sale.
As we were musing, the Abbot and Priest came
up, accompanied by the old Lama who had charge
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[97]
of the records. We became so engrossed with his
recital of the history, that it was necessary for the
Abbot to call our attention to the fact that the time
for our appearance before the Dalai Lama, was
fast approaching, and that we should be in robes ere
this.
When we arrived at our quarters, we found robes
laid out for each of us, but how to put them on was
a facer to us. The time was passing so swiftly that
we decided to make a bold quick try, and put them
on helter-skelter. It developed later on. that some of
them were inside out, and others backside foremost,
while a few had the robes on as they should be.
Upon arriving at the audience chamber, we beheld
the Dalai Lama crossing the hall with his guard, to
enter the chamber by the great doors. We were cer­
tain we saw a broad smile flit across his face.
We composed ourselves at attention to await the
opening of the side door, which was our cue to enter
the chamber. Soon the door opened and we were
ushered in, amidst the most gorgeous decorations
that it had been our lot to witness.
The ceiling of the room terminated in a great
dome in the center. In this dome were three large
openings through which great beams of sunlight
flooded, lighting up the room with a brilliance and
splendor too magnificent for description.
The walls were completely covered with gold
thread tapestries, interlaced with figures made of
silver threads. In the center of the room, on a raised
dais covered with a cloth of spun gold, sat the Dalai
Lama, dressed in a robe of spun gold, trimmed with
purple and spun-silver cloth.
We were conducted before the Dalai Lama by the
Abbot and the High Priest, and as before, they stood
at either end of the line. After a word of greeting,
the Dalai Lama stepped down from the dais and
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[98]
stood before us. He raised his hands; we kneeled
and received his blessing.
As we arose, he stepped to our Chief and placing
a brooch upon his breast, spoke through the inter­
preter, “This will allow you and your associates the
freedom of this land. You may come and go at will,
and with it I bestow upon you this commission,
which entitles you to the rank of a citizen of Tibet.
I confer upon you the title of Lord of the Great
Gobi.” He then walked down the whole line, placed
a smaller but similar brooch upon the breast of each
one of the company. “Wear this as a token of my
esteem. It will admit you to the whole land of Tibet.
It is your password wherever you go.” He took the
scroll containing the commission from the hand of
the Abbot and handed it to our Chief.
The brooches were beautifully made of gold,
wrought in filigree with a most lifelike likeness of
the Dalai Lama carved in relief on jade, set like a
cameo in the center. To us, it was a jewel which we
prized very highly. The Dalai Lama and all were
graciousness itself; all we could say was, “Thank
you.”
The old Lama who had charge of the records was
ushered in, and we were informed that we would
share the evening meal with the Dalai Lama.
After the meal was finished, the conversation
drifted to the remarkable tablets. The Dalai Lama,
as well as the old Lama, speaking through an inter­
preter, gave us a detailed account of the history of
. the tablets, all of which we carefully noted.
It seems that these tablets were discovered by a
wandering Buddhist priest in the vaults under the
\ ruins of an old temple in Persia. This priest stated
i that he was led to them by the sweet songs he heard
emanating from the ruins as he sat in Samadhi. The
songs were so sweet and the voice so clear that he
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[99]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
finally became interested, followed in the direction
from whence they came, and found himself within
the ruined vault. The voice seemed to come from
below. After a thorough inspection, he could find
no evidence of an opening; so he determined to
locate the source of the voice.
Securing crude tools, he began digging in the
debris and discovered a flagstone that seemed to be
only a portion of the floor of the ruined vault. His
heart sank in despair, as he though for a time that
he had been led from the right path by the wind
whistling through the old ruins.
Before leaving the place, he sat in meditation for
a few moments; and as he sat thus, the voice be­
came more clear and distinct, ending with the in­
junction to proceed. With almost superhuman ef­
fort he succeeded in removing the large flagstone.
This disclosed an opening leading downward. As
soon as he stepped through the opening into the pas­
sage, it was lighted up as by an unseen force. Ahead
of him gleamed a bright light. He followed the light,
which led him to the opening of a large vault, closed
by huge stone doors. As he stood for a moment be­
fore these doors, the hinges began to creak and the
great stone slab swung slowly, revealing an opening
through which he passed. As he crossed the thresh­
old, the voice rang out clear and sweet as though
the owner occupied the interior. The light that
seemed stationary at the doors, moved to the center
of the great vault, lighting it fully. There in niches,
in the walls of this vault, covered with dust and the
accumulation of ages, were the tablets.
He inspected a few, realizing their beauty and
value, then decided to wait until he could communi­
cate with two or three of his trusted associates, and
confer with them regarding the removal of the tab­
lets to a place of safety. He left the vault, replaced
[100]
the slab and covered it over again with the debris;
then started on a quest for associates who would
believe his story and who had the fortitude and
means to carry out his plan.
This quest lasted for over three years. Nearly all
those to whom he related his story thought he had
gone stark mad. Finally one day while on a pil­
grimage, he came across three priests whom he had
known while on a similar pilgrimage, and he told
them the story. At first, they were very skeptical;
but one evening at exactly nine, as they were sitting
around the camp fire, the voice began to sing of
these records. The next day the four of them drop­
ped out of the company and started the journey to
the ruins. From that time on, at nine o’clock in the
evening, the voice would sing. If they were weary
and downcast, the voice would sing all the sweeter.
At the journey’s end, as they were approaching
the ruins, an hour before midday, a slight boyish
form appeared before them and began singing, lead­
ing the way to the ruins. When they arrived, the
flagstone was lifted and they went immediately to
the vault. As they approached, the doors swung
open and they entered. A short examination con­
vinced the priests of the value and truth of the dis­
covery; indeed so enraptured were they that they did
not sleep for three days. They made all haste to a
village about seventy miles distant, to secure cam­
els and supplies which would enable them to move
the tablets to a place of greater safety.
They finally secured twelve camels, loaded them
and returned. The tablets were packed in such a
manner that they would not be injured. Securing
three more camels, they started the long journey
through Persia and Afghanistan, to Peshawar.
Near Peshawar they secreted their burdens in a
secluded cave, where they remained for five years.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[101]
One of the priests always sat in Samadhi before the
cave all the time, to protect the tablets. From
Peshawar they were moved to Lahnda in Punjabi.
Here they reposed for ten years. Then by slow
stages, they were brought here and deposited in the
palace of the Grand Lama. This took more than
forty years to accomplish.
From this palace, they were to be taken to Sham-
balla. In other words, we had found them in transit.
At this time in the narrative, an attend­
ant brought four of the tablets into the room and
placed them carefully on the raised place that an­
swered as a table around which we sat, so that we
faced them. Just as the hands of the clock pointed
to the hour of nine, a voice came forth in lilting
tones, infinitely sweet, yet of a highly pitched im­
mature boyish treble.
These are the words translated into English as
faithfully as we are able to present them:
“That there is an all-wise, intelligent Spirit, that
this intelligence is Divine and infinite and permeates
all things, cannot be contradicted. Because this in­
telligence does permeate all things it is infinite and
is the source of all. It is Divine, and its Divinity
brought into thinkable or visible form, the fact or
truth of all things.
“You can name this all-wise, intelligent Spirit,
God or Good, or what you will, as man must have a
name for everything. Once he has named a thing,
he has power to bring it into existence. If man
names anything through true reverence, worship,
and praise, he can and does become that which he
names.
“Thus you can see that man by choice can become
\ God or animal. He becomes the ideal which he pre­
sents for himself to follow. With this line of think­
ing, it is simple to see that man is the only-begot­
ten Son of God, or the only-begotten son of the ani-
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[102]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
mal. Thus, by choice, man can become evil or devil
if his eye beholds evil; or he becomes God, if his eye
beholds God.
“In the formless state, the all-wise, intelligent
Spirit was silent and contemplative; yet the intelli­
gence was there and saw itself as the producer as
well as the spectator of all animate and inanimate
things. In this silent state, the all-wise, intelligent
Spirit saw there was no modification; and resolving
to emanate or bring forth the universe, this intelli­
gence formed a picture of what the universe should
be. Having naught but the perfect picture or Divine
plan to follow, the universe willingly took the form
directed by the intelligence.
“The Divine Ideal picture was expanded until it
came into perfect visibility. This is the Universe
that we see today, that is going on with the perfect
plan held forth for it to assume.
“This intelligence is and always has been the per-
ceiver and director of its perfect, Divine Ideal plan.
“This intelligence knew that it was necessary to
bring forth animate form and endow it with all
potentialities, through which it could express fully.
This is what is known as immortal man. This Di­
vine Ideal which differentiates itself in all phases
and directions, is the immortal of each man today.
As this man was created in the Divine Ideal of all­
wise Intelligence, Spirit, he was set forth as the Son
of the Principle, with dominion over every attri­
bute and every condition. Son means union with,
not a servant of. It was necessary that this Son be
wholly free to choose, and in no way become a
slave or a puppet.
“This immortal ideal must always include a por­
tion or spark of the central fire of that which
brought or projected it into existence. This projec-
[103]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
tion was the first cell that finally became man’s
body and is the spark of life that always endures
and never dies. This cell is, in name, the Christ.
This cell although divided and repeated many mil­
lions of times, retains the image of the Divine Spirit
projected and implanted in it, and cannot be per­
verted by man’s thinking. Thus man is always
Divine.
“This cell projects its divinity into every cell cre­
ated by the multiplication of itself, unless perverted
by man’s thinking. The collection of these cells
finally assumes unto itself a container or cover,
which ie called the human body. The spirit or es­
sence, still in unmodified form, has the intelligence
to see all changes going on around it. By always
standing in his high dominion, man is Spirit and
Spirit is God.
“This higher self must be thought of, pondered
over, worshipped and blessed as being right within
man.
“First, there must be faith that it is there. This
brings forth the knowing that it does exist in man;
then the blessings and thanks given bring it into
visibility. Man is that very thing itself. This is the
way to the attainment of all knowledge.
“The brain at first seems to be the perceiver, be­
cause it is the aggregation of the more delicate
cells; and these cells first accept the vibrations and
amplify them so that they may be perceived by man.
Then they are selected and sent to all the other
organs; and each, if held in divine order, goes to
the very organ to which it belongs.
“Each organ and nerve center is the seat or spe­
cial amplifying center for centralizing the real man.
When they are harmonized and co-ordinated, man
stands forth in all dominion and power. He has
brought forth the Holy Ghost, the whole of the all-
[104]
wise, intelligent Spirit in creative action. This is
soul and body brought to one focal center. No man
ever accomplishes anything unless he consciously
or unconsciously brings every faculty to this one
center. This is the place of power, the Christ with­
in man, the place where man stands supreme.
“Then how can man suffer discord, inharmony,
sin or sickness unless he idealizes them and brings
them into existence? If he stands forth always and
at all times, as the all-wise, intelligent Spirit and
knows no other, he cannot be conscious of anything
less. With this highest ideal always held in the clear
waters of man’s intelligent thinking, he becomes
God. He is certain to be answered by this inner
voice at all times.
“Back of will, stands desire. Will, in its true
estate is a pure colorless force and is moved into
action by desire. If there is no color or direction
given to will, it is inactive. Place the desire in har­
mony with the will force and it will spring into ac­
tion immediately and call legions to carry out its
commands—the only requirement being that the
commands are in Divine order.
“There are myriads of worlds. There is but one
thought out of which they grew. Its law is order
which cannot swerve. Its creatures are free to
choose. Only they can create disorder, which in it­
self is pain and woe, hate and fear. These, they
alone can bring forth.
“The Great Principle stands forth as a Golden
Light. It is not remote, it is right within yourself.
Hold yourself within its glow, and you will behold
all things clearly.
“First, with all your being, know one thing; that
your own thought when you stand, is one with that
thought which brought forth the worlds.
“Out of the blackness of disorder and its outpour-
[105]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
ing of human misery, there must arise the order
which is peace. Wheu man learns that he is one
with the thought which is of itself all beauty, all
power, and all repose, he will know that his brother
cannot rob him of his heart’s desire. He will stand
in the Light and draw unto himself his own.
“Let pass through your mind, my son, only the
image you desire, which is Truth. Meditate only
upon the true desire of your heart, knowing that it
does not wrong any man and is most noble. Now it
takes earthly form and is yours. This is the law
through which you bring forth your heart’s desire.
“Let him who puts forth his hand to draw the
lightning to his brother, recall that through his own
soul and body will pass the bolt.”
With further research, these tablets may prove to
be copies of former records made to preserve the
originals. If copies, they must have been made dur­
ing the early Indo-Aryan Age. As far as is known,
there is nothing like them in existence today. From
what source but the One, did they spring? Thus
they could be repeated in song and verse many
thousands of times.
Oh man, where is your crown?
From eternity it passes on.
Where is your soul! but from
The Infinite it grew
Forever and forever
Is it but select to you.
Here were the four tablets set before us, each one
worth a King’s ransom.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[106]
CHAPTER XI
I
TRUST my readers will pardon the liberties I
have taken in digressing from the main text.
This has seemed necessary in order to get be­
fore you in as concise a way as possible, a few of
the numerous and widespread places where records
have been found that refer directly to the older civil­
izations, their arts and culture, as well as the deter­
mining thoughts and motives which have main­
tained civilizations in very high accomplishments.
A few groups still achieve these higher accom­
plishments. These groups do in a measure, through
the representation of these achievements, become a
guiding beacon for the human race as it again
marches on to another high point in civilization’s
progress. It is still to be determined whether the
mistakes of a few, accepted by the majority, can
again overwhelm and carry the great bulk into
oblivion for a great cycle of time.
It is our vision that the present holds all the fu­
ture; nothing save the accomplishments of the pres­
ent give form to the future. Thus humanity has but
one road; if the present be made perfect, the future
must be perfect. It is not the present perfection
DELAYED to some future perfection, it is the con­
scious present perfection that brings forth the con­
sciousness of the perfect future.
Wherever we go, we find a people that had, at
one time, lived wholly in the present. The whole
future was in complete accord with the attainments
of the present, so that the future could take no other
direction. Thus the injunction, “Take no heed for
the future.” All their precepts were, “Live true in
the present, and the future must be what the pres­
ent has been.”
[107]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
Their folklore, their songs, their prayers,—even
those written on wheels—portray this thought. The
devil dance in which the Tibetan participated so
freely, was originated to frighten away the evil one
who had destroyed their race concept or conscious­
ness. Through use, it has degenerated into a mere
ceremony to frighten away evil spirits. The people
have become so engrossed in spirits that they have
forgotten the all-inclusive spiritual.
This is not confined to just one race or one creed
but to all races and creeds. The first dance por­
trayed beauty and purity so thoroughly enthroned
that not even a suggestion of evil could dethrone it.
We also investigated the goblin tales from the
“sea of sand” as the Gobi is called in China. In
many places, one hears strange voices; many times
we have heard our own names called. We have
heard the din made by great throngs of people
which seemed to be close by. Often we heard a vari­
ety of musical instruments accompanying sweet
voices in song. We have seen many mirages and
heard the noises of shifting sands.
We are certain that the air strata at some dis­
tance above the desert are so clarified, that at cer­
tain times, when all conditions are in harmonious
accord, they act as sounding boards which reflect
the vibrations that have at one time gone out. In this
way we believe, medieval happenings are repro­
duced through the vibrations that were sent out.
Thus the air strata become the sounding boards that
pick up and reflect these vibrations just as they pick
up and send out the vibrations of a mirage.
We became so engrossed in our work that time
seemed to have wings. Working under the direction
of the old Lama, we made copies and measured
drawings of many of the tablets as well as of other
records.
[108]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
The morning of our departure dawned bright and
clear, and all was in readiness for the start to Shi-
gatze. We had paid our respects to all in the palace
of the Dalai Lama; yet the streets were jammed
with people, so anxious were they to wish us God­
speed. Everywhere hands were waving farewell or
offering prayers for our safe conduct. A delegation
preceded us for miles with prayer wheels on long
poles, turning out prayers. Fifty accompanied us to
Shigatze on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra
River. As we neared this, the second city in Tibet,
the great Tashi-lunpo Lamasery located a mile from
the city, came into view. A delegation from this
Lamasery met us three miles out and invited us to
be the guests of the Lamasery during our stay. We
were accorded a cordial welcome on every hand.
As we entered the Lamasery, we felt the calm and
peace which pervaded its halls, as of a great pres­
ence. It was indeed an ideal place in which to rest
before resuming our trek to Lake Dolma and Sans-
rawar. We were also anxious to inspect the records
of this monastery. From there we wished to go on
as rapidly as possible, as arrangements had been
made to meet the Master Bhagavanzi at the Temple
Pora-tat-sanga.
After the evening meal with the Lamas, we
talked of the many beautiful temples. The conversa­
tion then drifted to the difference in religious be­
liefs. One very old Lama said: “The same beliefs are
not shared by Lamas and Yogis. The Yogi cannot be­
lieve that the teaching of any one man can be final;
he sees that every human being has access to all
knowledge right within himself, while Lamas are
adherents of Buddha alone. In all probability, each
human being will unfold and realize his mightiness.
A Christian will reach the Christ consciousness, a
Buddhist will reach the Buddha attainment, and so
[109]
on. All have their gods, apd on every hand one can
hear that God made man in his image. All nations
and all peoples have their different gods.
“Some have their god of fire, others the god of
harvest, and so on. Each has a better God than his
brother. How am I to understand that God made
man in his image, unless from the many gods set
up, I would say that each man has made God in his,
man’s, own image?”
We found six Lamas at the head of a group that
were known as the wandering Lamas, who go hither
and yon without purse or scrip. They never beg,
ask alms, or accept food or money from any one.
They are always in touch with each other and with
the six that are at the monastery. Of this order,
there are three branches, with one at the head of
each branch, making nine that are in charge. The
three heads of the branches may be located in three
different countries. Each of those who go out, keeps
in direct touch with the head of the branch he is
working under; the head of the branch keeps in
touch with the six. The method which they use for
communication, we call thought transference for
want of a better name, but we know it to be a force
far more subtle and much more definite. They call
it Atma, soul conversing with soul, using no other
medium. We met six of these Lamas and had lunch
with them the next day.
The old Lama informed us that he would accom­
pany us to the Pora-tat-sanga temple when our
work was finished. We accepted his offer, as he was
a friend of the muni who was acting as our guide
and interpreter. They both assisted us in every way
with the records.
During a conversation, the old Lama casually re­
marked: “Two of your associates who left you last
summer, will arrive in Calcutta at one-thirty today;
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[110]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
and if you wish to communicate with them, you can
do so.” Our Chief wrote a message instructing them
to go directly to Darjeeling and look after a busi­
ness matter which needed attention, and to await
our arrival on August 24th. He dated the note, made
a copy of it, and handed the original to the Lama.
The Lama read the note, folded the paper carefully,
and put it away.
Our associates did meet us in Darjeeling on the
24th of August. They showed us a written message
which was placed in their hands not twenty minutes
after their arrival in Calcutta. They supposed the
man was a messenger who had been sent ahead with
the message. Now we had physical proof of the abil­
ity of some of these Lamas. If this ability could be
extended in one direction, why not in all directions?
We were anxious to press on toward Pora-tat-
sanga, as many would gather at the temple this sea­
son, a very favorable time for such a visit. We went
by way of Gyantze and were told that we would find
a very fine chela who was known to all as “the
laughing chela.” His laughter and song carried him
and his associates over many difficult places, heal­
ing many as he sang.
As we entered the courtyard of the Lamasery, a
very fine upstanding fellow approached us with a
hearty welcome, stating that they expected us to
make the Lamasery our home during our stay in
the village. We told him we were anxious to push
on to the Phari Pass in the morning.
“Yes,” he replied, “we understand that you are
on your way to Pora-tat-sanga. I return there in the
morning and shall be pleased to go with you if it is
your wish.”
We accepted, and with a hearty laugh, he con­
ducted us to our quarters in the great hall of the
Lamasery. After making us comfortable, he bade
[111]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
us good night and took his departure, saying he
would meet us in the early morning. As he walked
away he sang in a well-modulated voice. This was
the laughing chela. We were awakened in the morn­
ing at an early hour by his singing announcement
that our morning meal was ready.
We bade the Lamas goodby, received their bless­
ing, and found all in readiness for our departure on
the journey to Phari Pass. This led us past the
mountain peaks of Phari and Kang La. In all, it was
an arduous climb, but at the rough places the chela
went ahead with laughter and song. At the more
difficult places, his voice would ring out and it
seemed as though it lifted us over them without
an effort. We arrived at the top of the Pass at three
o’clock in the afternoon.
To our surprise, instead of rugged mountains, we
found a beautiful valley stretching out before us.
This valley is called Chubi. Although it is sixteen
thousand feet above sea level, either side of the val­
ley is skirted by fine forests whose heavy leafy trees
were very luxuriant. Ahead of us we saw villages
with beautiful temples. We did not go through the
valley but took the shorter trail by way of Tachi-
cho-jong, then on to Pora-tat-sanga. Even this trail
proved good. We had proceeded but a short distance,
when we entered a beautiful forest with small
streams on every hand. Here we saw an abundance
of song birds and wild fowl. We had not encoun­
tered a predatory wild animal on the entire trip; this
probably accounted for the abundance of wild life.
Our next stopping-place was at Maha Muni. Its
fortress-like temple intrigued us; and here, as al­
ways, we received a hearty welcome. Those in charge
told us that it would be useless to ask us to remain
longer, as the Master Puriji had preceded us to the
Temple Pora-tat-sanga where many Yogis, Sad-
[112]
hus, and Gurus were gathering; and that we would
have a goodly company on our last day’s journey.
Early the next morning, the pilgrims were as­
sembled, anxious to be on their way to keep their
tryst with the great Master Puriji. All were eager
to get the first glimpse of Pora-tat-sanga,—as they
expressed it, a jewel set in a rock ledge, the most
lofty of any temple in the world.
“Would we stay at Maha Muni when this great
prize loomed just ahead of us?” sang the laughing
chela. “Oh no. Fare thee well, Maha Muni, we love
you and shall return to your tender embraces. To
journey to Pora-tat-sanga is irresistible.” So the
cavalcade moved on. The great Everest was before
us, standing out in the light of approaching dawn,
stark and white in its robe of pure crystal. It seemed
to beckon us to take just a few steps more, reach
out our hands, and touch the hem of its garment.
Yet when we had taken the few steps, its mass still
eluded us. Chomolhari, its near neighbor, twenty-
four thousand feet high, which we had passed, now
seemed a pigmy compared with the monster just
before us.
We thought the trail on its flanks stony and per­
ilous but now we labored over a trail much of the
distance on hands and knees. Still, the song and the
laughter of the chela bore us onward as though on
wings.
In our enthusiasm, we forgot the dangers. It
seemed that we accomplished these places instantly.
The sun, while it dispelled the illusion of touching
mighty Everest in another stride, revealed gran­
deurs of which description in words would only be­
come a travesty. There were towers and great tem­
ples of nature crowned with crystal on every hand;
but Everest, Great Everest, lay before us.
We saw it in the moonlight, with the first light
[113]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
of budding dawn, as the first rays of sunrise kissed
its fair brow; then with the full rays of the noonday
sun streaming down upon it; and again as the sun
gradually faded and bade it goodnight, with the last
rays bathing it in glory, the afterglow raising an
answering glow toward heaven upon its crest.
Can you, dear reader, not see why the trail that
day was not long and arduous? It all passed in an
instant. The vibrations of strength, peace, power,
and harmony, that are always sent forth from the
temples, but serve to urge travelers on to these
peaks. Do you wonder that the Himalayas engender
no fear in man? Do you wonder that poets never
tire of singing their grandeur?
Finally at nightfall the trails were all con­
quered, and we stood gasping on a flat table-like
rock of considerable extent.
In the distance before us were many temples, but
the jewel Pora-tat-sanga stood out two thousand
feet above us, bathed in dazzling light. It seemed
like a great arc lamp sitting in a crevice in the per­
pendicular rock wall, its light lighting up the rocks
and temples all about us.
Here in the amphitheater on the rock where we
stood, was a great concourse of men and women.
To our surprise we found that women were not
barred from this pilgrimage; all who would, could
come.
Here great Rishis have lived. Along this trail the
Rishi Niri had passed. Thrice, the five brothers had
passed over this trail, once alone, once with their
great mother, and again with the great and good
Darupati, the pride and grandeur of all womanhood.
Here now sits Yogi Santi the great, the pure, but
the humble one in deep Samadhi.
“Where can all these great ones find shelter and
food?” we suggested.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[114]
“Do not worry about food or shelter,” sang the
laughing chela. “There is an abundance here of
food, shelter, and clothing for all.”
“Sit down, every one,” came in sweetest tones
through the voice of the chela. No sooner were all
seated than great bowls of nourishing hot food ap­
peared. The Yogi Santi arose and began passing the
food around, assisted by the chela and others. When
their hunger was appeased, all arose and were con­
ducted in groups to the neighboring temples, there
to pass the night. The temple to which we were con­
ducted by the chela was upon a perpendicular, table­
like ledge, about seventy-five feet above where we
and the others were standing. As we approached, we
noticed a long pole with its base resting upon the
rock where we stood, its top resting on the shelf­
like rock above. As it seemed to be the only means
of communication, we gathered at its base and
looked up. As we stood thus, other groups joined us.
There were a number of other temples built in
the niches formed by other ledges just above the
first shelf. For a moment our only hope of shelter
for the night seemed to depend upon our ability to
negotiate this pole. Then the chela said, “Don’t
hurry.” Through his voice came a great burst of
song. “0 loved one, through you we look for shel­
ter this blessed night.”
Instantly every one around stood silent for a mo­
ment. As with one voice, they spoke forth these
words with dynamic power, “Such is the God power,
A-U-M;” instantly all were standing on the rock
ledge, and we with the rest, proceeded to our re­
spective temples. When we arrived at the temples
assigned to us, every trace of fatigue had left. We
slept like babes that night. The emanations of pow­
er sent out by that group would have leveled moun­
tains had it been so directed.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[115]
CHAPTER XII
T
HE next morning at four, we were awakened
by the voice of the chela, ringing out loud and
clear, “Nature is waking; so should the chil­
dren of nature awake. The morn of a new day is
just dawning. The freedom of the day awaits you.
A-U-M.”
We went to the ledge where the top of the pole
had rested the evening before and found to our sur­
prise that the pole had been replaced by a well-built
stairway. As we walked down, we wondered if we
had been dreaming the night before.
The chela met us at the foot of the stairway and
said, “No, you have not been dreaming. The stairs
were dreamed there last night. The Master Puriji
placed them there for the convenience of all; so
you see they are a dream which came true.”
During our stay of two weeks in that region, we
were served with hot nourishing food. In no in­
stance did we see food being prepared, yet we were
bountifully served.
The chela and one other started to climb to the
Pora-tat-sanga. The first approach was by means of
crude steps cut in the rocks; then there were planks
across fissures which made yawning canyons below.
Part of the ascent was accomplished with the aid of
ropes made fast in the crevasses above. Although
the two men climbed for two hours they made no
headway beyond the second ledge which was about
five hundred feet from their starting point. They de­
cided they would be obliged to give it up.
When they hesitated, Yogi Santi, knowing their
plight, called to them: “Why don’t you come down? ”
The chela replied, “We are making the attempt,
but the rocks are holding us fast.” They were having
[116]
the experience of many, that it is easier to climb
a sheer rock wall, than to come down.
“Well, why not stay there?” jested the Yogi.
“We will return tomorrow with food; perhaps by
then you can climb to the top.”
He then admonished them to keep perfectly calm,
as he realized the difficult situation they were in.
After three hours of careful direction they were
with us again. With a sigh the Yogi murmured,
“Thus wanes the enthusiasm of youth.”
The youths looked longingly upward. “If Master
Puriji stays there, it will probably be our bad luck
to stay here. That trail is too troublesome for us.”
“Don’t worry,” said the Yogi, “a higher one than
yourself will take care of that. Now rest. You made
an excellent start.”
Many asked when we would be able to see the
Great Master. The Yogi answered, “This evening.”
We wondered how a temple could have been built
in the position Pora-tat-sanga occupied.
The Master Puriji came and talked with us dur­
ing the evening meal. The failure of the attempt to
climb to the temple was mentioned. The Master
said that they had succeeded because they had made
the second attempt.
At four the next evening we all gathered below
the temple. The Yogi Santi sat in Samadhi. Three
of the company walked to a large flat stone and
seated themselves as though in prayer. In a very
few moments, the stone began to rise and all were
carried to the temple on the stone.
Then Yogi Santi said to the chela and two oth­
ers, “Are you ready?” “Yes,” they all answered
eagerly and sat down on the rock beside him. In­
stantly the rock began to move gently, and together
they were transported to the temple roof. Then our
turn came. We were asked to stand in a group; then
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[117]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
all arose to their feet and those at the temple came
forward on the roof and began to chant A-U-M. In
less time than it takes to relate, we were standing on
the roof of the temple. Within the space of a few
moments, all were gathered at the highest temple
in the world.
When we were seated, the Master Puriji began
speaking: “There are a number among you who
have never witnessed body levitation and they won­
der. Let me say there is no wonder about it, it is a
power which belongs to man. We look upon it as
knowledge of the ancient Yogi. Many people have
used it in the past and it was not looked upon as
miraculous. Gautama Buddha visited many distant
places through the levitation of his physical body.
Thousands of people have I seen that have made the
accomplishment and there are much greater evi­
dences of power than this that you will see, evidenc­
es of a great irresistible force that can be used to
move mountains when brought under complete con­
trol.
“You praise and sing of liberty and freedom
from bondage and fear, but unless you have for­
gotten bondage and forgiven it, you have remem­
bered bondage too well and have forgotten liberty.
A system of pure Yogi is a message of complete
freedom to the whole world.
“Let me give you an explanation of the A-U-M.
In English the brief form OM is used. The right use
in Hindustani is A-U-M; therefore we will consider
it in this light.”
“ ‘A’ is a guttural sound. As you pronounce it,
you will note it starts in the throat.
“To pronounce *U\ the lips must be thrust for­
ward.
“ ‘M’you will note, is formed by pressing the lips
together, causing a resonant tone like the humming
[118]
of a bee. Thus you will see that the sacred word of
AUM includes the whole vocal range. All other
sounds are within that range. It is basic, compre­
hensive, all-inclusive, infinite. Its universe includes
all names and forms.
“We know that form is perishable, but the con­
crete or real, before form was expressed, that which
is named Spirit, is imperishable; for this reason we
denote that imperishable reality, A-U-M.
“The Sadhu instructs his students thus, ‘Tat-
toomamu-asi.’
“When the students realize, through deep medi­
tation and absolute Truth, they reply only ‘Su-ham.’
The teacher says to the student, ‘Thou art God, and
the student replies, ‘That I am, su-ham.’
“Let us look closer into the statement and the
answers which the student gives when he realizes
his Godhead, ‘su-ham.’ It contains two consonants
and three vowels; the two consonants s and h, the
three vowels a, u, and m which is a medial syllabic.
“The consonants cannot be pronounced unless
joined to vowels. Thus in the domain of sound, the
consonants represent the perishable, the vowels the
imperishable.
“Therefore s and h are relegated to the perishable.
A-U-M remains, and forms AUM the eternal.
“O inquirer after Truth, AUM is the great GOD.
Wise men attain their objective sustained by AUM.
He who contemplates ‘A,’ the first part of AUM,
contemplates God in the wakeful phase. He who
meditates upon ‘U,’ the second part of AUM, the in­
termediate phase, obtains glimpses of the interior
world and is of Spirit. He who meditates upon ‘M,’
the third part of AUM, sees God as himself, becomes
illumined and is free immediately. Meditation upon
AUM, the highest self, includes ALL.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[119]
“I am looking far out into the great white cos­
mos of light. There stands one with a simple gown
of purest light drawn closely around him, the be­
nevolence of pure light beaming from his counte­
nance. From all around him comes the voice, and
through that voice the words, ‘You are forever and
forever.’ He comes nearer and nearer. The voice
again speaks, ‘This day and hour are given unto
you, the priesthood of all human kind, that has no
beginning and no end!’ It is the focal point of the
emanations of pure light, brought together to show
all humanity their origin in Divinity. This is not the
symbol of an order or brotherhood; it is the symbol
of humanity in its pristine purity before a brother­
hood began. The pristine condition has not yet spo­
ken; this is long before the earth moved in its great
nebula, long before the earth claimed its orbit and
attracted that which belonged to it.
“This is the projection of the first human form
that must stand forth in complete command of all
force that starts to bind the atoms of the earth’s
nebula into form. Listen. The voice around him is
speaking. The command is ‘Let there be Light.’
The dazzling white rays shoot forth, the
form brings them to a focal point, the earth’s neb­
ula is bursting forth, and that focal point is the
central sun of the nebula. As the central nucleus
draws its atoms together, they take on more light.
There is conscious direction back of this form that
projects light rays to the focal point.
“Now the form is speaking, and we hear the
words. They are formed by letters of pure gold
light; I can read them. ‘I come from the great cos­
mos of light to watch you, 0 earth. Draw your par­
ticles to you. Into every particle project light which
is eternal life, Light which is of the great Principle
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[120]
of Life. The Father, the emanations of all Life;
and I declare unto you, I AM.’
“Now I see the form beckoning. Standing with
it are other forms, and from their midst one speaks,
‘Who is the dearly beloved that stands forth from
the Father, the light cosmos?’ The voice from
around again speaks in low whispered words, ‘This
is myself brought into form to have dominion, as I
have dominion, and through myself my dominion
manifests.’ Lo, it is the Krishna, the Christos, the
Christ, all three in ONE.
“The form again speaks and answers, ‘I AM, and
all of you are THAT I AM.’ The voice continues,
‘Look beyond me; the voice of God speaks through
me. I AM God, and you are God. Every soul in its
pristine purity is God.’ The silent watchers sitting,
hear the voice speaking through that form, saying,
‘Behold man is God. Again the Christ of God comes
from out the great Cosmos.’
“This is not emotion nor infatuation; this is a
clear, calm, vision of man, standing forth from God,
in full dominion and mastership. This is the master­
ship of all humanity; not any one is excluded. Back
of the form is pure crystal, dazzling white light,
emanations. It has come forth from pure white
light, it is formed of pure white light; therefore
man is PURE WHITE LIGHT. Pure white light is
God life. Through man only, do the pure rays of
God Life emanate or manifest. As we fix and fo­
calize our ideal through contemplation, the vision
takes life, stands forth, comes closer and closer, un­
til our vision and the form are united and stand
forth as ourselves, and become one with us; then
we become ‘THAT.’ Thus we say to all mankind, ‘I
AM YOURSELF expressing God.’ When the true
mother sees this at the time of conception, the im­
maculate conception takes place; then there is no
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[121]
rebirth. This is womanhood, manhood; wo-man-
hood is God—the true Godhead of all humanity.
This is Atma, the inclusion of soul in man and
woman.
“Woman’s true dominion is co-existent, co-ordi­
nate with the image. The One is the ideal male and
female. Together they are Darupati, the pride of
motherhood, the ideal of womanhood, the eternal of
humanity brought forth as helper and helpmate;
many times destined to stand alone in perspective,
but together in the whole of the Cosmos plan. In
woman’s true dominion, she offers her body on the
altar of birth to be used to nurture and present the
Christ child to the world. This is the true conception
of the immaculate; and when presented in true
thought, word, and deed, the child is not conceived
in sin and born into iniquity; but is pure, sacred,and
holy, conceived of God, bom of God, the image or
Christ of God. Such a child need never go through
rebirth. It is only through thoughts of the physical
that the child is born into the physical and thereby
allowed to assume the physical thoughts of sin and
discord of the elders or parents. This alone makes
rebirth necessary.
“When woman allows the Christ to stand forth
from within, she is not only the Christ, but the
child is the Christ and is like Jesus. She then sees
the Christ of God face to face.
“When wo-man, that which has wedded or
brought together the male and female, sends forth
her true call, her immaculate body is ready for that
immaculate thing—the conception of the Christ
Child—to be presented to the world. This body was
prepared and projected forth for woman long before
the world was projected into form.”
Master Puriji ceased speaking. He invited us to
accompany him to a great cave where sat many
Yogis in Samadhi.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[122J
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
We lived at the temple and in this cave for nine
days. Many of the Yogis have lived here for years
and when they come out of this seclusion, they do
wonderful work among their people.
We were told that after the assembly was over, a
number would be returning to India by way of Lake
Sansrawar and Muktinath. Then from Muktinath
we would go to Darjeeling very comfortably.
This was good news, and we were greatly elated
at the prospect of traveling with these great ones.
We went from cave to cave and talked to many
of the Yogis and Sadhus; and, to our surprise,
found that many of them were there summer and
winter. When asked if they were troubled with
snow, they replied that no snow fell in that vicinity
and that there were no storms or fogs.
Time passed on swift wings and the eve of our
departure was upon us.
[123]
CHAPTER XIII
T
HE morning of our departure, the community
was awakened at three o’clock by the voice of
the chela chanting. We were aware that some­
thing unusual was happening, as he was inviting all
to come forth for a moment.
As we stepped out from the temple, the light
from Pora-at-sanga blazed forth so brightly that the
whole section was aglow. The chela stood on the
corner of the temple and asked for silent contempla­
tion. We could see hundreds of forms standing with
their arms upraised.
The silence was broken by the words, “Hail,
Hail, Hail, the Master Puriji chants.” Thousands of
voices joined in. The echo gave the effect of many
more thousands. In the stillness of the morning,
every word could be heard.
These were his words: “Could there be a God of
the Hindu, a God of the Mongol, a God of the Jew,
and a God of the Christian? There is a true Univer­
sal Principle, Director, Primal, Infinite and Divine.
The central light of that principle is called God.
God must enfold all. God does enfold all. All are
God. This surely does not mean a God of just one,
and not for all.
“When we speak of God, we speak of one and all,
for all, in all, through all and of all. Should the Hin­
du name his God and say there is no other, his
thought is divided. Should the Mongol name his God
and say there is no other, his thought is divided.
Should the Jew name his God and say there is no
other, his thought is divided. Should the Christian
name his God and say there is no other, his thought
is divided. A house divided unto itself is shattered
and must fall. United it does maintain forever.
[124]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
Choose whom you will serve. Division is failure
and death. Unity in the Father-Mother Principle is
eternal progress, honor, and dominion. A-U-M.
A-U-M. A-U-M.”
It seemed as though this AUM reverberated
around the whole world. We could hear the echoes
of the AUM-reverberations for at least ten minutes,
as though a temple gong had sounded. At times it
seemed as though the rocks themselves were giving
forth the AUM. As these reverberations gradually
ceased, all gathered in the great rock amphitheater
below us, and we joined the assembly.
When we were seated with our group, Yogi Santi
raised his arms above his head, and in unison all
chanted the AUM as before. Again the rocks seemed
to send forth the vibrations. This lasted till the meal
was finished.
As we arose, all stood silent for a moment. Then
sang the chela: “We shall bid you farewell; and our
greatest blessing we leave, as we depart from your
most gracious presence. May we ask the honor of a
return welcome.
“We hesitate to depart and know that we with
longing hearts and eyes shall look forward to our
return. We bid you farewell. May the richest bless­
ings of all that is holy be bestowed upon you.”
The reply came as though with one voice: “Loved
ones, we are never parted, though you may think
space separates us. Not so; distance has no power to
separate, for God and yourself permeate all space.
We need not even say farewell, for we see you at all
times, face to face. You do not go, you do not come,
you are always here. There is no time, no parting,
no passing; the present is here, hence the future
also. Where can we be, except we are all together
in God? Do not go hence but come hither, and you
are always here.”
[125]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
As the last words floated out to us, we were well
on the trail. While our steps were retreating, we
were still there. There was no parting, and we have
never felt that we actually left that sacred place.
All day long the chela laughed and sang. Again
his laughter and song lifted us bodily as it were,
over the most difficult places.
We arrived again at Maha Muni, the silent one,
at two o’clock that afternoon. Instead of stopping
for the night, we pushed on, and though we trav­
elled for sixteen hours, and covered over seventy
miles that day, we were not fatigued. Thus we trav­
elled to Sansrawar. Here we were conducted to a
beautiful temple near the lake, where we rested for
two days before pushing on through the Trans-Him­
alaya Pass. This is a near-Paradise. The lake rests
like a jewel in a great mountain setting. Birds sang
from the trees all about.
Here, the greater portion of the party lived. We
would go on to Muktinath with Yogi Santi, the
laughing chela accompanying our party. We had
often heard of the difficulties of this pass, but al­
though we were many days on the trail, we encoun­
tered very few difficulties and reached Muktinath in
due time. There we were again greeted by Emil
and a number of our friends.
No words can convey the pleasure we experi­
enced at this reunion. We had travelled far and had
been accorded the greatest hospitality and kindness;
yet here we experienced the thrill of a true home­
coming.
While we were relating some of our experiences
that evening, Emil said: “Now you know why the
Tibetans, at altitudes of twenty-one thousand feet,
are apparently undisturbed with heavy loads upon
their backs. Now you know how they climb Mount
Everest as they claim. They go to the crest of the
[126]
God of Mountains, as they call Mount Everest. They
overcome, or come up over, the god of the moun­
tain just as they overcome the god of any burden.
In other words they let go the burden; then the bur­
den does not exist. You cannot put a burden upon
the shoulders, much less upon the form, of the true
God-man. Now you may see the truth in Jesus’
statement, ‘Come unto me, all ye that are weary and
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.’ The true state­
ment was, ‘I AM does give you rest.’ When you rest
in the I AM, you change from the god of burden, to
GOD that is rest and peace. You have come up over
the god of burden to the Father of rest; therein you
carry no burdens. God the Father is man’s power
to think rightly and directly through any condition.
“Man, as the poor worm of the dust, is not in
God consciousness; this is man expressing in the
worm consciousness, only.
“If you are shooting at a target and you wish to
hit the mark, you must focus your whole thought
upon the center of the target; then with your will in
complete focus you must see nothing but the mark.
When you have hit the mark, you have brought
forth or accomplished God in a degree.
“God is your divine ideal, the focal point upon
which every thought and act is centered. It is in
this way that you bring forth the divine spiritual
man, the Christ of God, the word made flesh. The
flesh is God, as well as God is around the flesh.
Make your subjective one objective, a willing and
all-wise worker with God-Principle. Head straight
for your objective; make that objective the divine
spiritual life that God within you is, and God sees
for all. No one ever accomplished anything unless
with all his will in complete focus, he held his ob­
jective (God) directly before the pure mirror of his
thought force. That thought force is himself acting
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[127]
as God, demanding of himself that his attention be
so thoroughly focused upon his objective (God),
that it (God) is brought forth instantiy. The instant
God is objectified, present the mould or pattern you
desire and it is filled full. If this were not an abso­
lute fact, you would not, nor could you, have
thought of your desire. When your desire is set
forth in this way, it is divine. With your divinity
always projected, your desire is conceived in divine
order. It is wholly within your power, to say when
it shall come forth. You are always in command.
You have all power to speak the word of authority.
To all outer things your command is ‘complete si­
lence.’ Now you can say definitely and knowingly,
‘There is no greater power than the Christ within
me. I now send forth my Christ-endowed word; it
does accomplish all things instantly. There is no
greater driving force than my Christ-endowed word.
I praise, bless, and send it forth with abundance,
harmony, and perfection.’You have first spoken the
word (God) which represents your true desire.
Never go back again to the asking (this attitude en­
genders doubt); but go on, recall what you have
done,—you might have put forth your Christ word;
you are in command. The thing is finished and
complete, it is in divine order.
‘I thank you, God, for Life and Light
Abundant, full and free;
For perfect, boundless, wealth and power
Unhampered liberty.’
Recall that if any two unite their spiritual force,
they can conquer the world, even though singly they
can do nothing. These two are God and you, united
in one purpose. If others will unite with you with
the same sincerity of purpose, your power becomes
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[128]
greater as the square of the number of persons.
Thus every person standing forth one with God and
united with you, becomes the power that is in­
creased fourfold.
“If two of you shall unite with God as touching
any one thing they shall ask, it is done for them of
my Father. My God becomes your God, and we are
together. Together with God, man conquers that
which is not Godlike.
“Go into your closet (your God-self), shut the
door to all else, close the outer eyes, see singly your
true God-self. You have quietly put yourself into a
spiritually receptive mood.
“God Principle is the one point. I am one with
Universal Life Energy. It is flowing through me
now. I know it, I feel it. I thank God my Father,
that I have the ability to accomplish all things.
“When you pray to God, with I AM in direct con­
tact with all Universal Life Energy, you are using it
in limitless measure. God is the name you give to
the all-wise, intelligent Spirit, and this spirit is with­
in as well as without every human being. It is neces­
sary for you to let God stand forth through you into
outer expression; therefore it is not necessary to
seek knowledge and help from outside sources,
when you know that the source of all knowledge,
the spirit of all knowledge, the understanding truth
is latent within you. Why seek knowledge from
without, as God, the Universal Spirit, is within?
Through this understanding, you call upon this prin­
ciple when you accomplish any one thing, you know
that the God within is the greatest of teachers.
“You realize that all the power you possess is
first drawn to you, then generated within your body
and sent forth to accomplish whatever you direct it
to bring forth. This is God emanating through you;
not a personal god, but an all-inclusive God within
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[129]
you. When you let God stand forth from within,
you are connected with God, as God interpenetrates
all conditions. By worshipping God within, and see­
ing God standing forth from you, you are worship­
ping God, the Deity in the whole human family. To
worship an outside deity, is to bring forth idolatry.
To worship God within and to see God standing
forth, from within out to all the world, is to bring
forth and be in conscious contact with, the emana­
tions of God life and light everywhere.
“There cannot be a deity outside of your body
that is not within your body, as all is vibrating or
emanating energy. Thus these vibrations flow
through your body as well as around it, and the
vibrations of Deity include every atom of your
whole body as well as the whole mass of the Uni­
verse. Thus you put God everywhere, before all,
within all, around all, enveloping all, and enfolding
all. There is not an atom of space that does not
have the emanating energy of light and life flowing
through them.”
Having finished this discourse, Emil stated they
would meet us in Hardwar, and bade us good night.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[130]
CHAPTER XIV
i we neared Hardwar, about a day’s journey
from the city, we stopped at the home of an
American whom we called Weldon. He gave
us a hearty welcome and insisted upon our remain­
ing with him for a few days.
Weldon, a well known writer, who had lived in
India for many years, was in sympathy with and
deeply interested in our work. He had asked several
times to join our party, but circumstances had been
such that we could not include him. As we sat in his
garden next day, relating our experiences, Weldon
suddenly remarked that he had never fully accepted
the authenticity of the history and life of the man
called Jesus of Nazareth. He had studied available
records carefully, but they had all seemed vague and
lacking in conclusion. Finally he had given up in de­
spair, as there were very grave doubts in his mind
that such a character existed. Our Chief asked him
if he were brought face to face with Jesus, did
he think he would know Him, and how would he
recognize Him?
Weldon replied: “You have touched upon a sub­
ject that has been the greatest motivating ideal of
my whole life. You will never know the absorbing
interest with which I have looked forward to some
sign of actual truth of the man’s existence in bodily
form upon this earth. Each year my doubts have
grown stronger until I have despaired of ever find­
ing a trace that I can place full confidence in. How­
ever, there has always been something away back
somewhere that I might define as a vague thought
or ray of hope that some time, somewhere, if I
could meet this man face to face without a sugges­
tion from any outside source, I would know Him
[131]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
positively. Instinctively this thing wells up before
me; and I say this to you,—I have never before
voiced it,—I know I would know Him. This is the
most sincere feeling I have ever experienced; and if
you will pardon me for the repetition, I will say
again, I know I would know Him.”
That evening as we were preparing to retire, our
Chief came to us and said: “You all heard the con­
versation regarding the man Jesus this afternoon.
You recognized the sincerity of our friend. Shall we
invite him to go with us? We do not know nor have
we any way of determining whether this man that is
known as Jesus of Nazareth will be at our destina­
tion. We cannot check his movements; in fact, we
only know that he has been there. If we invite Wel­
don to go and the man is not there, will it not re­
sult in further disappointment and serve no good
purpose? Weldon seems anxious to go with us;
since none of us knows that this man Jesus will be
there, there will be no suggestion from any of us in
any way. In this, I think the time is auspicious.”
We all agreed.
The next morning our Chief invited Weldon to
accompany us. Instantly his face lighted up with
anticipation. After a moment’s reflection, he said he
had an assignment for the following Wednesday
and would be obliged to return by that time. As this
was Thursday, he would have six days. Our Chief
thought the time sufficient; so we decided to leave
that afternoon. All went well and we reached our
destination before noon of the second day.
As we arrived we noticed a group of twelve peo­
ple sitting together in the garden of the lodge we
were to occupy. As we approached they all arose,
and the owner of the lodge came forward to greet
us. In the group we saw the man Jesus standing.
Before anyone could .say a word or make a sug­
[132 ]
gestion, Weldon had stepped from our midst, with
both hands extended; and with a joyous exclamation
rushed forward, clasping Jesus’ hands in his, saying,
“0 , 1knew you, I knew you. This is the most divine
moment of my whole life.”
When we realized what had taken place, there
was something akin to divine joy that swept
through us as we beheld the rapture of our friend.
We stepped forward and exchanged greetings as
Weldon was introduced to the group.
After lunch, while sitting in the garden, Weldon
said to Jesus, “Won’t you talk to us. I have been
waiting a lifetime for this moment.”
There was silence for a few moments, then Jesus
began: “In the silence of the hour, I would have
you know that the Father to whom I speak and who
dwells within me, is the same loving Father who
dwells in all and to whom all can speak and know
just as intimately as I do.
“A breath of wondrous glory sweeps across the
chords that vibrate with a love, pure and divine. It
is so pure that the waiting silence stops, and intently
listens; the fingers of the great and knowing One of
yourself, touches your hand with lingering softness;
and the voice as always is telling you of the Father’s
great and glorious love. Your voice is saying to you,
‘I know you are here with me, and together you and
I are God.’ Now the Christ of God, stands forth.
Won’t you erase every limitation and stand with me
in spirit? Greater thoughts have not been given,
than these I give unto you. It does not matter, that
men say it cannot be. You, each one of you, are
standing forth the Divine Master, conquering and in
full dominion, just as you have seen me conquer.
The time is here; the fulfilling pure thought that
you have sent out to the Divine Master has come to
fruition in your own body, and the soul has taken
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[133]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
complete command. With me you soar to heights
celestial.
“We lift these bodies up until their shining radi­
ance becomes a blaze of pure, white light, and to­
gether we have returned to the Father from whence
all have come forth.
God our Father is pure light emanation, and
from this vibrating light, all come forth; in this vi­
bration, all stand together with God. In these vibrat­
ing emanations of light, all material consciousness
is erased and we see creations projected forth from
the formless into form, all things renewed every in­
stant. In the primal cosmos, aqueous or God sub­
stance, all things exist; and because of that exist­
ence, the vibrations are so high that none perceive
them. Unless one stands forth in spirit as we do, it
is necessary to raise the vibrations of the body to
spirit vibrations.
“Now we can see creation going on all the time,
as creation is caused by the radiation of cosmic light
vibrations generated in the great Cosmos, and this
radiation is the great universal life or light energy
that sustains all and is called the Father of radia­
tion or vibration. It is the Father of radiation be­
cause its radiation will shatter any other radiation
or vibration. In reality it only sets them aside in
order that other forms may take their place.
“When our body vibrates in tune with Spirit vi­
brations, we are light vibrations, the greatest of all
vibrations, God the Father of all vibration.
“It will soon be proved that these cosmic rays
constitute such a terrific bombardment that they are
destructive to so-called matter. These rays are from
the source of all energy, the Father of all elements,
the source from which all elements come. This is
not destruction, this is transmutation from so-called
matter to spirit form.
“It will soon be known that these cosmic rays
[134]
have such tremendous penetrating power that they
penetrate through all mass, shattering as it were, the
very heart or nucleus of a so-called atom, transmut­
ing it into atoms of other substance and thereby
creating other elements of higher order; and in this
way, creation advances into a higher emanation of
pure light or life itself.
“These radiations which have such tremendous
penetrating power, are readily distinguished from
all radiations coming from the earth or sun galaxy,
and have complete control over all these radiations
or vibrations. It will soon be known that these ra­
diations come from a universal source, unseen, and
that the earth is continuously subjected to a terrific
bombardment of these rays that are so potent they
change or transmute atoms of one element into the
Infinite particles of another element. It will also
be found that when this cosmic ray strikes the
nucleus of an atom, it does shatter it. It separates
this atom into the minute particles of another sub­
stance, causing transmutation from a lower to a
higher element. Thus these do not destroy matter;
they transmute it from a lower to a higher radiat­
ing element,—from the material to spiritual.
“This higher element is as man dictates; it is
higher as he names and uses it for a higher purpose.
When man stands forth in spiritual vibrations, he
can fully determine and regulate these rays and
their mode of action.
“Thus to man, standing in spiritual vibrations,
transmutation is going on all the time all about him.
Transmutation is but creation in the higher sense.
Thus all are created where they stand. Creation
never ceases; it is continuous, never ending.
“The emanations of radiation from the Cosmos,
are made up of light and are composed of so-called
light bullets that burst forth from the Cosmos. This

greater Universe is round and encloses and sur­
rounds all universes, to the extent that the suns
absorb and bring into its central sun, conserve, con­
centrate and build up, all the energy that is dissi­
pated from the universes. This central sun becomes
so full of vibrating, pulsing energy, and this energy
becomes so condensed that the so-called light bullets
are shot out with such radiating force, that when
they collide with the nucleus of another atom, that
atom is shattered but not destroyed. Its particles are
transmuted into particles of other elements which
are finally assimilated into the element to which
they belong; then that element comes to life.
“Life is the energy that is released by this so-
called bombardment of light bullets; and that por­
tion absorbed by the particles released is called the
life of the particle, or of the whole element; while
the portion of the energy released but not absorbed
as life, is returned or drawn back to the Cosmos as
it were. It is again concentrated and condensed un­
til it can be again shot forth to collide with and
shatter other atoms, thus creating the particles that
go to create the atom of another element.
“Thus creation is continuous, everlasting; expand­
ing and concentrating, then through reduced vibra­
tions, condensing into form.
“This intelligent, emanating, Energy—is God,
controlling the universe around us, as well as con­
trolling the universe of our bodies which are spirit­
ual and not material.
“This transmutation is not disintegration. The
intelligence so directs that only a few of these light
bullets strike the nuclei of other atoms, at a time
ratio, and in complete conformity to law, so that no
manifestation is overbalanced.
“Man, one with this supreme intelligence, can in
an orderly way, step up this impingement, so that
[136]
his needs are fulfilled instantly. In this way, man
hastens the slow process of nature. He does not in­
terfere with nature; he works with nature in a
higher rate of vibration than that in which nature
works in the lower order of concept. ‘Lift up your
eyes and look on the fields; for they are white al­
ready to harvest.’ [St. John 4:35]. All is vibration
and corresponds to the plane or field upon which
vibration acts. The planes or fields spoken of, have
no reference to the concentric bands or shells that
surround the earth. These concentric shells or layers
are ionization bands which enclose the earth and re­
flect back vibrations originating on the earth, but
they do not impede or shut out Cosmic light rays.
It is through them that transmutation or creation is
going on all the time. Even our bodies are trans­
muted from a lower to a higher condition, and we
become the conscious directors of this change, by
keeping the thoughts, and therefore the body, at­
tuned consciously to the higher vibrations. Thus we
attune the body consciously to a higher vibratory
rate and we become that vibration.
“In this condition the master waits. As you stand
now, you arc master, you are ruler over all condi­
tions. Now you know that the glory and the con­
sciousness of a Divine creation is far above any
material thought.
“The first step is fully and completely to control
all outer activities of thought, mind and body, with
the thought always uppermost, that you are cultivat­
ing the habit of perfection, the God habit, the Christ-
of-God habit. Do this wherever you are, every time
it comes to you during your working or resting
hours. See this perfect presence within you. Get in­
to the habit of seeing this perfect presence as your
real self, this Christ-of-God presence. Then go a
little further; see a Divine White Light, dazzling in
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[137]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
purity and brilliance emanating forth from the very
center of your being. See it shining forth with such
brilliance and glory that it emanates from every cell,
fibre, tissue, muscle, and organ of your whole body.
Now see the true Christ of God standing forth, tri­
umphant, pure, perfect and eternal. Not the Christ
of me, but your own true Christ of God, the only be­
gotten of your Father God, the only true son of
God, the triumphant and all conquering Godhead.
Step forth and claim this as your divine right and it
is yours.
“Every time you say ‘God,’ know fully that you
are presenting God; and you will do the world a
greater service by so doing than by presenting me
as the Christ of God. It is far greater and nobler
to see yourself as the Christ of God, you yourself
presenting God to the world and beholding God as
yourself.
“You sit back and pray to me to intercede for
you. It is wonderful that you do present me to the
world as the Christ of God and recognize the God
qualities presented through me, just so long as you
do not make an idol or image of me and then pray to
that idol. The moment you make a graven image
of me, and pray to that image, you debauch me and
yourselves. It is well to see the ideal that I or any­
one else presents, then make that ideal your very
own. Then we are not apart or separate from God;
as such, man conquers the world. Do you not see
the greater thing to be accomplished by standing
forth ONE with us in God?
“If you cultivate this with love, reverence, devo­
tion, and worship, it becomes a habit and soon it is
all of you, your daily life and existence. In a short
time you have brought forth Divinity. You are once
more the Divine Christ, the first-born of God. You
are One with Primal Spirit, Energy. Actually feel,
[138]
see, and take hold of this Great Light; accept,
declare and know positively that it is yours; and in
a short time, your body will actually send forth this
light.
“In every age and every condition, all through
the great immensity, this supreme light has existed;
it is everywhere. This light is life.
“When anything is made plain, we are enlighten­
ed regarding it. The light shines forth into our con­
scious concept. Soon the LIGHT of LIFE will shine
forth to your watching eye, as it has to all great
ones. Many of these great ones are portrayed stand­
ing forth in a great blaze of light. Although you
may not see it, this light is real and is life, radiating
from your body.”
Here Weldon asked if we might talk over some
of the Bible teachings, and Jesus readily assented.
We arose and walked out of the garden together.
Weldon exclaimed, “Just think! Here you have
contacted these people and I have lived in the same
neighborhood and never recognized them. This day
has indeed been a revelation to me. A new world, a
new light, a new life stands revealed.”
We asked him how he recognized the man Jesus.
He answered, “You marvel that I recognize the
man for what he is. I do not know how I know. I
know and nothing can shake that knowing.”
We suggested that if he kept his assignment, it
would be necessary for him to leave the following
Monday and that two of our party would leave for
Darjeeling on that day and would accompany him.
“Leave,” he replied. “I have already dispatched a
messenger asking another person to take my assign­
ment. I am staying here. You just try to send me
away.”

[139]
CHAPTER XV
A
FTER a most interesting day going about the
countryside, visiting many places of interest,
^ we returned to the lodge at eight o’clock and
found our friends assembled in the garden.
After a short talk on general subjects, Jesus
spoke, saying they realized that Weldon was mysti­
fied. He went on to say: “I shall talk to you just as
I wish you to talk to yourself. If you will make these
statements true or make them a part of yourself,
you will need no other. These statements are in no
wise to be used as formulas. Students can use them
to bring their thoughts in accord with Divine Prin­
ciple, or as many say, ‘to train their thoughts to the
one point.’ We use the word GOD as often as pos­
sible, repeating it many times.
“It is a well known fact that the oftener you say
or use the word GOD, knowing it to be the highest
principle in-dwelling and flowing through you, the
greater benefit you will derive from it. Allow me to
repeat,—our thought is, ‘You cannot say GOD or
use the name too much.
“See God as Creative Principle flowing through
you; concentrate and energize that principle, and
send it out with more dynamic influence. Because
of the fact that it always flows through you as well
as around you, you are able to give it a greater im­
petus by sending it out with the whole force of your
being, impelling it outward. Man’s body is the me­
dium through which this force is transformed and
added impetus is given it, in order to do a greater
work and be sent forth in greater form.
“Thus there is far greater force added to this prin­
ciple through the fact that millions are magnifying
its radiations and sending them out; yet one man
[140]
standing forth in full dominion can conquer the
world. Thus you see what millions could accomplish.
“The more you use this name knowing that it is
the in-dwelling God Principle that you are establish­
ing within you, the higher the rate of vibration of
your body. These vibrations become correlated, and
respond to the Divine vibrations which the word GOD
means and gives forth. Should you say GOD once,
meaningly, your body will never return to the same
vibratory rate that it was giving off at the time you
used the word GOD. With this thought in mind,
make these statements your very own; put them in
your own language if you so desire. They are from
you and not from any outside source. Just try for
a time and see what it will do for you. Recall that
every time you think God, you are God’s Divine
Plan. These are not my words, they are your words
coming from the Christ of God, yourself. Bear in
mind that Jesus, the man, became the Christ as He
expressed light, which is pure life or God.
“God, my Father, the Divine Principle, flowing
through me, is all; and all that God is, I AM. I am
the Christ of God, God-man.
“All that God my Father is, is for God-man to
use; thus I AM is entitled to use all substance. In
fact, God my Father is pressing out all substance to
God-man in unlimited measure.
“God Principle is my Father; I AM the Christ of
God; both in whole and complete union. All that
God has, the Christ of God is.
“Let us take the word GOD. Why is it that this
word has so much power? It is because of the vi­
brations that are released when the word is spoken,
-
—they are of the very highest, they are the Cosmos,
the most effective vibration. They come in on the
Cosmic Ray and set up the highest field of radiation.
This field is all-inclusive, all-penetrating, all-existing,
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[141]
and rules all mass. They are the ruling elements of
all energy and this vibration is the vehicle that car­
ries light and life.
“The ruling intelligence back of this radiation is
what we term GOD, and through its radiation, the
intelligence pervades everything. From this radia­
tion field, both light and life emanate. When man
accepts these, he unites them in his body; they are
one. His body responds immediately to the light
vibration and he is God vibration; his body radiates
light. Thus, one standing forth as God is often in­
visible to one functioning in a lower vibratory field.
This is the reason that the word GOD is so powerful.
“Because of this sustaining word GOD, your Bihle
has maintained such influence and longevity. Think
of the number of times the word is written, and thus
spoken, in that great book. See the different lines of
radiation of light, and therefore life and energy, that
go out from each word either written or spoken.
Each word carries its vibrations to the very soul of
all who speak, hear, or see the word GOD; and as
the soul responds to that vibration, the book from
which the radiations come forth is lifted and exalted
correspondingly as the soul is exalted by the vibra­
tions. Thus the book is given life, power, and im­
mortality. It is in reality the word GOD that has
accomplished this. Thus you can say that the Book
is the word of God in the spiritual sense and not in
the literal sense of the word.
“Too many take the Bible literally instead of giv­
ing attention to its true spiritual value. This lack of
consciousness matters little, as the spiritual vibra­
tions set aside those set up by this attitude of
thought. When they think or say GOD once, those
vibrations far outweigh their lack of understanding.
“It is the survival of the Bible, that has proved
such a stumbling-block to the scoffer and critic. The
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[142]
atheist fails utterly to explain why the word GOD
supercedes and has complete dominion over the
word Evil.
“Repeat GOD thoughtfully for a time, then try to
set up a vibration in your body with the word Evil.
If you have not already experienced this, it will be
a revelation to you. Many scientists proclaim that
the theistic hypothesis is impossible. Do not mind
them, for the things which they pronounced impos­
sible yesterday, are being accomplished today.
“Do you not know that it is high time to go within
your house, put it in order, and find out what the
word GOD will do for you? Think attentively for a
moment, try it and see if it will not cause you to
drop all differences and bickerings. Speak GOD,
with your whole soul, and feel the exhilaration that
causes you to treat your brother more kindly and
deal with him more justly. Place God before you,
and the mist of the long-forgotten ages will be dis­
pelled as a wisp of smoke. The intellect may frown
upon this. Don’t mind the intellect; it has erred
many times. Stand forth with the word GOD dom­
inant within you, and a whole world of strife and
confusion cannot touch you.
“When you know positively that GOD or supreme
vibration does exist and that it is ALL POWER, you
can use it to accomplish ALL THINGS. With it
you can transport yourself from place to place. If
you are in one place and the need is for you to be
elsewhere, recall it is the self that is holding you
stationary, not GOD. You are using God power in
limitation if you remain where you are. Let go of
self, erase limitation, put forth the command that
you are the Christ of God, one with the God vibra­
tion and power. The instant you make it definite
that you are God vibration, you will be at your des­
tination. Just thinking a thing does not accomplish
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[143]
that thing. YOU MUST KNOW AND DO; then love
and worship the source or principle enough to do it.
“Faith shows the way through thought; but it
takes the actual command of the Christ of God, that
you are that vibration. The instant you allow that
vibration to take full command, you GET UP AND
DO IT. The KNOWING through love and worship
becomes the accomplishment. That you are uncon­
scious of their radiations does not set aside the fact
of their existence. Through faith in their existence,
then knowing that they do exist, you become con­
scious of their existence; then you can use them.
“When you express a vibration and are in tune
with that vibratory field, you are invisible to things
that express in a lower vibratory field. Thus if your
body vibrates with the speed of light, you are invis­
ible to those that cannot see light. Light is Life;
thus, if you live wholly in the vibrations of light,
your body is pure life. Light and Life, is God. Thus
all are GOD when they live in the God vibration.
“ ‘The sun shall be no more thy light by day;
neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto
thee; but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting
light and thy God, thy glory.’ [Isa. 60:19.] The
Lord Christ of God has no more need of light when
his body vibrations are in unison with God vibra­
tions. His body is light, purer than that of the noon­
day sun. The Lord (or law of) God expressing pure
life (light) through Jesus or man, becomes the
Christ upon earth. Each man becomes the Christ
when the Lord (law) or law of God is understood
and actually lived.
“ ‘I AM the light of the world: he that followeth
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
light of life.’
“ ‘The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou
bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[144]
Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear
record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know
whence I came and whither I go; but ye cannot tell
whence I come, and whither I go. Ye judge after the
flesh; I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judg­
ment is true: fori am not alone, but I and the Father
that sent me. It is also written in your law that the
testimony of two men is true. I am one that bears
witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
beareth witness of me.
“ ‘Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?
Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my
Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known
my Father also.’ [John 8:12-19.]
“How can you walk in darkness if you walk hand
in hand with God? If you let God triumph, your
works and accomplishments are eternal. You came
forth with this vibration and as long as you live true
to this light, you will never perish or change—these
vibrations go on forever.
“Many have lived noble lives and accomplished
noble deeds, all accomplished through God vibra­
tions. Thus they have the power to create by lower­
ing these vibrations and allowing the aqueous sub­
stance to consolidate into form. Aqueous substance
is that substance which contains all elements. Scien­
tists will discover that all elements can be resolved
into this aqueous or vaporous condition. In this
state, all substance vibrates or radiates at the same
rate of vibration. Thus by lowering the vibrations
to the rate at which the particles of the element will
coalesce or come together, you may produce the ele­
ment desired. Here the Cosmic radiations play an
important part. Here the transmutation takes place.
“Many great souls have lived and their works have
passed with them, because they were unconscious of
the power that sustained them. They as well as
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[145]
others were unconscious of their works and thus
were forgotten. Had they recognized this power,
and then, through definite thought and action con­
solidated these deeds, their accomplishments would
have stood forth as a mountain that could not be
forgotten; the same as the great mountains of ac­
complishments that stand forth before humanity
today, as, for example, the Great Pyramid of Egypt.
“Is it not much greater to live the Christ life? Is
it not worth while to make this your ideal? Does
this not completely erase the petty things of life? Do
you not see the accomplishments of the ones that
dared to step forth and live the Christ Life?
“As you accomplish this, you stand on the Mount
of Transfiguration.
“Man’s law and prophecy disappear and the tri­
umphant Christ stands alone, but not lonely. You
can do this, all can do it, if they but will.
“Now you know that you and the Father are One.
This is the testimony of two standing together as
one law and this testimony IS TRUE. Thus, if you
judge, your judgment is true. If you bear record of
this origin, your record is true. As you know your
origin with the Father, you never pass on, you al­
ways know the Father. ‘If they had known one, that
is my Father, they would have known me,’ for our
vibrations would have been in perfect accord.
‘“ Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught,
saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I
am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent
me is true, whom ye know not. But I know him:
for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
“ ‘Then they sought to take him : but no man laid
hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
And many of the people believed on him and said,
When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than
these which this man hath done?
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[146]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
“ ‘Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am
I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. Ye
shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I
am, thither ye cannot come.’ [John 7:28-34.]
“You know that the spiritual and material is
merged within the Christ. Spirit knows, ‘I come not
of mystery, I am of the Father.’ The temple (body)
must become a pure channel through which the
Christ shines forth. When the Christ is risen in the
individual, then will he do greater miracles than
these which I have done. As you seek, you will find
the Christ in me, the Christ in you, brothers one
and all.
“Your hour shall come when the Christ appears
to each one of you as an individual; then will you be
lifted up into the Christ consciousness and glorify
the Father as I have glorified Him.
“It is written [in Matthew 27:46], that my last
words on the cross were: ‘My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?’ This is a complete mis­
translation. The words actually were: ‘My God, my
God, thou hast never forsaken me or any of thy
children, for thy children can come to thee as I have
come. They can see my life as I have lived my life.
Thus, by living that life, they do incorporate the
Christ and become One with you, God my Father.’
“There was never a thought of desertion or sepa­
ration. The Christ of God stood forth definitely,
long before that hour. Had they burned my body,
I could have reassembled it from the same particles
that were released in the seeming destruction. Had
they divided every particle of the body, it could have
been reassembled instantly; there would have been
no change.
“Man is so constituted that when he stands forth
with the understanding of the Christ of God, he re­
leases enough intelligent energy and that energy and
[147]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
intelligence so completely envelop him, that, should
the body be disintegrated and the life element be­
come separted from the particles, this intelligent
life principle could reassemble and consolidate those
same particles into the same form in which it had
expressed itself. The mould or pattern is there; it is
built, of and in, the substance which cannot be de­
stroyed. It would only be necessary to reassemble
the substance and fill the mould, interpenetrated
with the same life element, and you would have the
perfect pattern or image as before.
“Thus you can see that the crucifixion did not
harm me; it harmed only those who attempted to
harm the Christ Principle. It was an example of the
fulfilling law of the Great Principle, a pathway
which all humanity may follow. Thus following,
they become the Christ of God, their ideal consoli­
dated into imperishable form. Not even this body
was destroyed. Its vibrations were so high that the
mere act of fastening it to and raising it upon the
cross was but a symbol that those who crucified me
had finished all limitation which the mortal could
put upon the body. The necessity for the completion
of the fulfillment of mortal limitation was to place
the body in the tomb and roll a great stone thereon
and completely seal the tomb. Thus the cry: “It is
finished.”
“When the mortal is finished, immortality is com­
plete. Thus it is impossible to confine the immortal
body of man even in a rock-hewn tomb. The rock
could have been dissolved to release such a body,
had such a necessity arisen. Thus you see that the
whole scene was a symbol of man’s heritage.
[148]
CHAPTER XVI
T
HESE gatherings continued for a number of
days. It was decided that Gordon, Weldon and
I would stay with these people, while the chief
and the others would return to Darjeeling where the
party would establish headquarters, in order to as­
semble and tabulate the data which we had secured.
After they had departed we established our camp
more permanently, as this would be our headquar­
ters until our Chief returned in December.
Our location was at the crest of a ridge extending
into the valley from a spur of the main mountain
mass, at an elevation of about five hundred feet
above the valley floor. The location and setting
were most advantageous for a main camp, as it was
readily accessible to many different places which we
wished to visit.
The camp was in the midst of a great grove of
tall, stately trees. The ground sloped gradually from
the main ridge toward our camp, giving it the ap­
pearance of nestling in the center of a crescent­
shaped amphitreatre, with the valley as a great
mural enclosing the other segment. Beyond and over
the mural, the sun went down in a sea of liquid
gold. Every evening this color was reflected upon
the upward-sloping surface of the ridge, that served
as the background of our amphitheatre, bathing the
crest of the ridge in a sea of throbbing, pulsing
color, like unto a gigantic halo.
As one stood in silence, just the last rays of the
sun were shut off by the horizon, one could imagine
a great Being with arms outstretched at the level
of the shoulders, a robe of pure gold draped in
most artistic folds, drawn closely around, with an
aura of pure white light blazing out for miles.
[149]
One evening as we sat near our campfire just be­
fore sunset, the sun seemed to be blazing forth with
the most magnificent brilliance; so evident was the
unusual phenomenon that every member of our
party was entranced. One remarked to a Sanyasi
that had arrived a few moments before, that the sun
was attempting to outdo itself before bidding us
good night. “An auspicious event portends,” replied
the Sanyasi. “A mella of great souls accompanying
a most high one, gathers here shortly. Quiet please.”
Instantly a hush as though from outer space
seemed to settle over the scene. Suddenly a heavenly
voice burst through the stillness, in most melodious
and heavenly cadence. Then thousands of Ko-
kila chimed in with a thrilling high-pitched treble,
that blended with the voice and song so harmon­
iously that one could but believe that the cantata
was heaven-born. Could you, dear reader, have wit­
nessed the scene and heard the song, I know you
would pardon the superlatives.
In a moment the treble of the birds was silent, but
the song floated on more majestically than ever.
Then on the slope of the ridge, there appeared two
angelic female figures, robed in shimmering silvery
folds, which gave a dim outline of mystically beauti­
ful forms. So beautiful were the features, that one
can only say, “Why outrage them with mere words?”
We, as well as the Sanyasi, sat enthralled, for­
getting to breathe for a moment. Suddenly thous­
ands of voices joined in the chorus; then forms be­
gan to assemble and circle about the two central
figures. The song ceased as suddenly as it began and
the figures disappeared. Absolute silence reigned su­
preme, and a great form appeared as before but in
a greater array of brilliant color. As the sun’s rays
faded, the form gradually diminished, until standing
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[150]
before us was a well-shaped manly form, with a per­
fect, symmetrical figure, and flowing hair of match­
less color. His body was clad in a shimmering white
robe, which fell from his shoulders in layer upon
layer of artistic folds; clasped around the waist was
a loose silver-white girdle, the hem of his robe just
brushing the grass as he advanced toward us with
stately strides. A Greek god could not have looked
more majestic.
As he came close, he paused and said: “We do not
need to be introduced; we need not be formal. I sa­
lute you as true brothers. I extend my hand and
clasp that of myself. Do I hesitate to embrace my­
self? Not so, for I love you as myself. Together
with God Principle, we love the whole world. I am
as you are, nameless, ageless, eternal. Together in
true humility, we stand in the Godhead.”
He stood silent for a moment. Instantly his rai­
ment was changed, he stood before us clothed as we
were, and at his side was a great Rajputana tiger. It
was a beautiful beast, whose coat appeared like silk­
en floss in the afterglow. A momentary fear swept
over us; so engrossed had we been with the occur-
ance, that we had been unconscious of the tiger’s
presence. Suddenly the animal crouched. A com­
mand from our guest, and the tiger arose to its feet,
walked forward and placed his muzzle in the man’s
outstretched hands. The wave of fear had swept
over, leaving us calm. Our guest sat down before
the campfire, while we drew close about him. The
tiger walked a short distance away, and stretched
full length upon the ground.
Our guest said, “I have come to partake of your
hospitality for a time, and if I am not intruding, I
shall abide with you until the great mella.” We all
attempted to clasp his hand at once, so eager were
we to extend a welcome.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[151]
He thanked us, and began by saying: “You need
not fear any animal. If you do not fear them, they
will not harm you in any way.
“You have seen a body inactive on the ground be­
fore a village, for the protection of the inhabitants.
That is only a physical sign to the people. The body
is exposed, inactive, and at the mercy of the beast;
though inactive, it remains unharmed, and the peo­
ple note that fact. Thus they lose all fear of the
animal. The moment they have lost their fear, fear
vibrations are not projected; and the animal failing
to pick up any fear vibrations, does not see the peo­
ple as something to feed upon any more than he
sees the tree, grass, or huts about him, as they pro­
ject no vibrations of fear. The animal may pass di­
rectly through the same village where formerly he
had selected the one he would feed upon, as that one
was emanating the greatest fear. You have observed
this. You have even observed the same animal stride
directly over the prostrate form on the ground,
walking directly through the village, looking for
that which fears him.
“You observe the same animal walking directly
between two small children less than twenty feet
apart, and attacking an older person that fears him.
The children were not old enough to know fear;
therefore the animal did not see them.”
Memories of these experiences came flooding
back, and we realized that we had not thought deep­
ly enough upon the subject of fear to register its
deeper meaning.
He then went on to say: “Love an animal and it
must reciprocate with love; if it resists love, it will
destroy itself before it can harm you. The animal is
far more conscious of this condition than the hu­
man.
Glancing toward the tiger, he said:“ Let us present
[152]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
love to our brother here, and note the response.”
We responded as best we could. Immediately the
tiger rolled over, bounded to its feet and walked
toward us, evidencing the greatest joy in every
movement. The Rishi then resumed: “Approach the
animal as your enemy, and you have an enemy to
contend with; approach him as a brother and you
have a friend and protector.”
The muni who had accompanied us from the Tau
Cross Temple, in Tibet, arose, announcing that he
would leave us as he must return to Hardwar, to
serve the pilgrims that would be gathering for the
mella. With an exchange of salutations, he left us.
Although he had been very silent, we had enjoyed
his comradeship beyond expression. There are many
like him in this great land; they need not speak a
word, yet you feel their greatness.
After the muni had departed, we sat down but had
scarcely composed ourselves, when into the camp
walked Emil, Jast, and Chander Sen. After an ex­
change of greetings we sat down and arranged an
itinerary, to tour a large portion of this country.
When this was concluded, Emil related many of the
interesting legends intimate with the places we
would visit. Of these, I shall record but one, as it
relates to the district in which we were camped and
had a most interesting and close association with
the Malia Kumba mella, that is held in this district
every twelve years. To that mella and the shrines of
this district, there assemble more pilgrims annually,
than to any other district. Here, assemble as many
as five hundred thousand people at one mella. As
this season’s event would be of vast import, it was
expected that this number would be augmented by
hundreds of thousands. The auspiciousness of the
event already pervaded the air.
Here, food is provided for all pilgrims free, dur-
[153]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
ing the mella. Hardwar is known as the Great Holy
Place. At Brindavan, Sri Krishni lived, and in this
valley he grew to manhood. The district is a near-
Paradise. This is the home of the sweet-songed bird,
Kokila.
In this district, stand the jeweled landmarks that
came into existence where fell the drops of everlast­
ing nectar as they were spilled from the jar of Amri,
nectar which was cast up from the sea after the
battle of Devatos (god) and Asura (demon),—in
other words, of spirituality and gross materiality.
This designates the time when India awakened to
the vast import of spiritual life. This jar of nectar
was so precious that a second battle was waged for
its possession. Such was the haste of the god to out­
distance the demon, that drops were spilled from
the jar; and where they fell, these jewelled land­
marks were erected.
This is a legend that veils the deeper spiritual
meaning. That the meanings of these legends are
permanent, everlasting, and far-reaching, will be
evidenced, later.
Here in this district we wandered visiting many
temples, accompanying the Great Rishi. In Decem­
ber our Chief met us and we travelled south to
Mount Abu. From there we returned to Brindavan
and Hardwar, and again visited many temples
where we were accorded the most intimate and cor­
dial associations with these people’s lives. These in­
timate associations, teachings, and occasions cannot
be published. The only restriction placed upon us,
was the request that should we wish to give these
out, we would do so personally to groups. In fact
the request wras, that they should not be written but
should be given orally only to those who requested
them.
The assembling of this great multitude of holy
[154]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
men and devotees is a never-to-be-forgotten experi­
ence. Here there is no hurry, confusion, or crowd­
ing among this vast throng, all travelling a direct
route to one point for one purpose. One sees be­
nevolence and kindness on every hand, and hears
the name of the Most High, or the Almighty on
every lip, most reverently. It is a spiritual echo
down the long, long corridor of what the western
world calls Time. This has no import in the vast­
ness of the East.
One can only imagine a great concourse of four
or five hundred thousand people; there is no way
of counting them.
As we were sitting before our campfire on the
evening of the day preceding that of the great mella,
the Rishi explained to us the purpose of this great
event.
Nearly all these gatherings in India have a far
deeper meaning than appears on the surface, or than
the repetition of the legend would imply.
[155]
CHAPTER XVII
T
HE Rishi resumed: “Rut it is written, ‘Eye
hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath en­
tered into the heart of man the things which
God hath prepared for them that love him.” [1 Cor.
2:9] This should have read, ‘For them which love
and bring forth the Christ of God.’
“Few understand Life’s Principle or the purpose
of Life. The Understanding Principle is that which
stands under all things and is the principal thing.
Therefore it is a true proverb, ‘With all thy getting,
get understanding.” Understanding conscious pur­
pose, underlies everything. It was this that brought
forth so proficiently for Solomon. He asked that the
foundation of understanding be given to him, and
that an understanding heart be his. This opened to
him such a fount of wisdom, and led him to such a
position of power, that there were bestowed upon
him such riches and honor that he was known as the
King of one thousand magnificent accomplishments.
This has been symbolically spoken of as Solomon’s
“thousand wives.”
“In Solomon’s time, a wife was the symbol of a
great accomplishment, an omniscient understanding
which foresaw' the whole history of the Universe
and its definite connection with Humanity and each
of its units. When Solomon gave out these accom­
plishments to his people, and used them for their
benefit, there were added to his store ‘three thou­
sand more’ and his songs ‘were a thousand and five.’
‘And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding
exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the
sand that is on the sea shore.’ [1 Kings 4:29-32]
“Solomon was not a king in the literal or temporal
sense of the word; he was a king over himself and
[156]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
his own household. This kingship he did hold. From
that throne, he dispensed love, understanding, wis­
dom, justice, and abundance to all that asked for
wise counsel.
“At that time all humanity was asking; and in
response, he received love, understanding, wisdom,
justice, and abundance a thousand fold. Although
Solomon ruled them with a ‘rod that standeth up­
right like iron,’ it was the symbol of law that never
fails. When that which he had sent out was mag­
nified a thousand times ten thousand, and returned
with the same power, the Kingdom that Solomon
held, though it were the whole earth, could not con­
tain the richness of the reward of the law or lord
that knew the treasure of the Christ of God, when
he obeyed the command that the Self must come
forth and obey God, Principle.
“Give with no thought of receiving, and you can­
not encompass the reward. First give love to God,
then to all the earth. When that love returns it has
encompassed the whole earth and is magnified a
thousand times ten thousand; as it has passed
through the thoughts of millions of people, and each
has increased it one thousand times ten thousand
fold. When it returns, is there room on earth for
the fullness thereof? x
“This alone has released earth, and heaven is the
result. Harmony reigns supreme. Solomon com­
manded of himself that he do this with understand­
ing, wisdom, justice, abundance and great joy. What
happened? The earth could not hold the abundance;
it was earth no more, it was Heaven.
“Do you wonder that those of Solomon’s day
called him a great King, a God? They fell down and
worshipped Solomon, thinking that he could furnish
them with every needed thing. This is where they
erred; they did not realize that Solomon was the
[157]
example that they should follow. God said unto
Solomon: ‘There shall be none like you in all the
earth.’ There could be none like him on earth for
he had released the earthly estate; the heavenly
estate was his, and therein reigned his people as
kingly as Solomon reigned. He set forth God, the
heritage of man, which they must follow.
“Could such a King condemn one of his kings to
death, when by doing so he condemned himself to
the same death, multiplied one thousand times ten
thousand? Such a king ruled justly,—not over other
kings, but with kings, and there need be no pomp or
glory of outer display. He need not even display his
crown—all humanity knows of the crown. Such a
King is a true ruler, not of the few, but with every
human unit—they rule with him. This is man and
God reigning supreme. This is the House of Israel,
when the house becomes the tree, the root, the
branch, the twig, the leaf, the flower, and the per­
fume that the flower emits, the very spirit of all
races.
“Such a race did inhabit this earth and such a
race will again inhabit this earth. I say unto you,
you need not falter; heaven is here, if each human
unit will but make it so.
“As men refuse to heed the call they will go out
and retufn through birth to life, with its trials and
tribulations; then through death again and again,
until the lesson is finally learned,—that upon the
rock of absolute spiritual perception the whole hu­
man family is built.
“To such a race, death does not exist, nor can it
again exist; therefore Karma does not exist; Karma
is but retribution for bringing into manifestation,
discord and inharmony. Substitute renunciation for
retribution and you correct the cause for Karma, as
it exists only in the thoughts of those determined to
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[158]
manifest Karma. Remove the cause or substitute it
by a higher condition, and the lower condition is
erased. You have elevated the vibrations of your
body above those which allowed Karma to exist.
“Death in no way removes Karma; neither does
it destroy or erase it. Death adds to and magnifies
Karma many fold, thus heaping it in great billows
upon each human unit. The instant you let go of
death and rebirth, you are free from death and
Karma; both are erased. If erased, they are forgot­
ten; if forgotten, they are forgiven.
“If at this stage, the absolute permanency of life
cannot be perceived, thus conceived and brought
into being, then there is an ultimate remedy for the
mistake of death, named reincarnation.
“Reincarnation is but a guiding light on the blind
trail of death. When this light leads, death may be
overcome through round after round of earthly ex­
periences. Then through the lessons which those ex­
periences teach, we arrive at the accomplishment of
letting go of man-made conditions of creed or dog­
ma, that have been imposed upon us. Then we may
again step forth into the full glory of God, into the
light that is shining just as brightly, which has only
seemed dim because we have wandered farther from
the Father’s House, the house of our own true self
unalloyed by man-made creed and superstition.
“As we again approach the house, the light shines
forth brighter with each advancing step; and as we
enter, we find it aglow with light and with the same
warmth and beauty which only seemed dim through
our outlook. There again we shall find quiet, peace,
and rest; and in these we may feast at will. The
same would have been ours had we entered the
House before we wandered, creed and superstition-
bound. At the end of the trail all is forgotten and
forgiven as it could have been before the beginning.
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[159]
“ ‘Stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord
within you.’ Stand completely still in the physical
and see the complete salvation that the Lord Christ
of God standing forth as your true self, can give
you. Thus I perceived and stated the law that Abra­
ham made use of so long ago. It is just as true this
day as it was at that time. Manifestations take form
as they are conceived in thought, word, or action,
according to your belief. If the thought is not good,
the remedy is, ‘Change your thought. Call those
things that be not, as though they were.’
“There are many mistakes in translation from
the original texts to the context of your Bible, as
well as many false prophecies. Many of these were
brought about through lack of understanding of the
characters and symbols with which the translators
were dealing.
“These are excusable as the translators were consci­
entious, and their conclusions were presented as ably
as they were able to comprehend them. The greater
majority however, were base falsehoods, perpe­
trated deliberately to mystify, to mislead, and to
subvert the original gospel of the House of Israel.
“The first name was Is-rael, meaning the Crystal
or pure white race, the first race that ever inhabited
the world, the original or root race from which all
other races sprang. This race was also designated as
a pure light race, race in many instances, meaning
ray or beam. From this race sprang the Aryan race.
“The greater portion of this subversion of the
Bible came about or began in the first and second
centuries A.D., and this onslaught was directed in
particular against the books of Daniel, Ezra and
Nehemiah. These misrepresentations were extended
to the early works of Josephus and other books.
They show conclusively that they were purposely
perpetrated to hide well known data that existed at
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[160]
that time, and instances that happened before that
period. These falsifications were also instituted to
destroy the definite chronological system and his­
tory preserved by the Israelites from the time con­
sciousness began. Thousands of false histories of
true events were written and substituted for orig­
inals and large portions of true historical data were
distorted and effaced.
“The Aryan Race, a direct branch of this race,
used this same chronological system, and it has been
preserved by them in its purity. Through this sys­
tem, these forgeries and substitutions can be readily
traced. Thus we are in possession of true and com­
plete Hebrew chronology. We know these false­
hoods were extended to Solomon, and to his house­
hold of wives, as well as to many others of the Ten
Tribe House of Israel, its leaders, teachers, and
counselors.
“After the division of this Ten Tribe House into
two, the root kingdom was known as the House or
Kingdom of Israel. The other was known as the
tribe of Judah. While this tribe was of Israel, they
were by no means all Israel. To hear Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob referred to as Jews is not only com­
mon error, but subversion; as only the descendants
of Judah and those that came after, could be called
after his name ‘Jews.’ The term Jew was never ap­
plied to the Ten Tribe House of Israel nor to the
twelve tribes of Israel.
“The Israelites were not Jews but the Jews were
a tribe of the Israelitish Nation.
“When the tribe of Judah left Palestine and went
into captivity, the name ‘Jew’ was applied to their
tribe. Those that are known to us today as ‘Jews’
are the remnant of the tribe of Judah that returned
to Palestine after they were released from captivity.
Many of them had mixed their blood with the sur­
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[161]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
rounding nations. Those that call themselves ‘Jews’
today are less than one-third-blood of the real tribe
of Judah.
“Wherever the Jews have lived and mingled with
the Israelites or Aryans, they have flourished; and it
is to these nations that they owe their hardihood. As
time goes on, the Jews will see that it is to these
nations, that they will be obliged to turn for protec­
tion and succor, and it behooves them to keep their
house in order.
“That part of the tribe of Judah which joined the
Israelites in their migrations through Europe, are
not a part of the race that are now known as the
‘Jews.’ That portion can in no way be distinguished
from the other Israelites that settled in the British
Isles and elsewhere, and along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea, as through inter-marriage and
environment they have all lost their tribal charac­
teristics. I was of this race; therefore I know.
“The Jews are with us; we can trace their his­
tory step by step, down the ages, from the House of
Judah to the tribe of Judah, and down to the present
day. They are one of the standing signs of the great
race that has assisted in preserving the God ideal,
until all races are restored into one race, with the
Christ of God, the controlling factor, in each unit of
that race, as it was before the great race began to
disseminate and divide.
“It is not difficult to trace the migration of Israel
from Jerusalem. The trails of those who settled in
the British Isles are readily distinguishable. Like­
wise that of the tribe of Dan. Their name and his­
tory, also the places where they settled, identifies
them. The Danube River, named from the tribe, is
an open roadstead today, through which after dis­
seminating into tribes, divisions of these tribes came
to Britain later, as Danes, Jutes, Piets, and under
[162]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
other names as well. Thus they went into Scandi­
navia, Ireland, Scotland and other countries, and un­
der these various names, they came to Britain, and
thence to America. As they reach America, they are
in their former homeland. In this land of their
origin, they are fast losing their tribal identities and
are changing their language into the one language
and that language will be the one which they spoke
when they departed.
“They have wandered from home for a long,
long time, but they are back again to their home­
land; and that land extends to South America, Aus­
tralia, New Zealand and the South Sea Islands, and
is as far flung as Japan and China.
“The Japanese and Chinese have migrated but
little. They are divisions of a vital race that mi­
grated from the motherland of Mu long before the
disturbance that caused the mother continent to
sink. They were called Uiguar or wandering tribes
and are the progenitors of the Great Mongolian
races. It is in this homeland that the white race
achieved the highest civilization. They used emanat­
ing and radiating energy and released the energy of
the atom to do useful work. They also developed
levitation; thus they transported themselves from
place to place. Their philosophy was entirely free
from pagan worship, creed, dogma, and supersti­
tion. They worshipped true Principle as flowing
through all humanity, man as divine as God.
“Israel-Arya is the symbol of the single and wise
kingship and culture. From this race came the Bible
and to this race its highest precepts were addressed.
“The Christ in man was their ideal. This was the
torch that bore the light which was always aflame,
the head of the sceptre. To fan this flame and keep
it glowing ever brighter, that man may never forget
[163]
its precepts, those precepts were not only recorded
in one Bible, but in twelve Bibles.
“To guard against destruction or subversion, the
people built twelve corresponding Bibles in stone
and located them throughout the Motherland. In or­
der to bring them together under one head, thus
making the precepts everlasting, they built the Great
Pyramid; thus proving that the Christ, the founda­
tion of civilization, was solidly established on earth
among men. and could not be defaced or erased. It
would last forever, not only as a beacon that would
hold high the light, but as a reflector for that light.
It not only reflected the light but gave forth the
oft-repeated command. ‘If Humanity has lost the
light, go within; there you will find recorded the
precepts that will renew the light so that it may
shine forth from you, the lost sheep that are wan­
dering bereft of light.’
“With God all that wander without the light (life)
are sheep that have strayed from the fold. The fold
is always there to behold and return to. The Christ,
the shepherd, awaits with the lighted torch upheld
for those that will enter therein. Although it has
been hidden through the ages, it is always there for
those that come, seeking the light.
“It is the first expression from the Cosmos. The
voice, the word of God, comes forth. Here is LIGHT.
LET THERE BE LIGHT, the vibrations flashed
forth; with those vibrations came LIFE. That Life
is never separate from God, is witnessed by the fact
that this Great Pyramid with its foundation well es­
tablished on earth, rears its head uncrowned, to the
skies.
“When man accepts his true heritage, Christ, and
the fact that the Christ of God is his true self in full
dominion, the crown or capstone will be placed;
then will it stand as an everlasting witness to the
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[164]
fact that man will never again wander from the
fold.
“The Great Pyramid is a Bible in stone, an inde­
structible bibliographical record portraying events
of attainments and wanderings of God’s chosen peo­
ples. This does not mean just one people, but all
people who accept the Christ light. Neither does it
give those people license to act and be, less than
Christ-like. It stands as a witness, lest humanity or
its units wander away and forget, and dim this true
Light, that from their midst would come forth One
who had the determination fully to portray the
Christ and with torch held high, aflame with light,
would lead as the Christ within should lead.
“For ages civilization has been going downward.
In fact, so long has the great race trod the dark
path, it appeared that this great race would lose its
identity and revert to savagery and barbarism en­
tirely. It was recognized that only few were holding
fast to the pure concepts that belonged to humanity,
and that these few must withdraw into seclusion, in
order that they could more readily come together,
concentrate, and send out the light for the protec­
tion of humanity as a whole.
“Through this group, teachings were promul­
gated that the world needed a Savior, a God-man,
who could and would step forth, and through
thought, word or deed, teach and show humanity
first through its units, then en masse, that the Christ
still lived in them and was just as vital as ever,
although inactive.
“The Christ light had been submerged by them
because of their ignorance and refusal to live a
Christ-like life. Through the spoken word, proph­
ecy, and the heralding of groups and individuals,
the proclamation was sent out to humanity that the
Most High had appointed a Savior, who would again
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
] 165 [
live true to humanity’s highest concepts, and that a
Savior would come forth at an appointed time.
“This was an edict of the Most High which the
Godhead poured out through a group of human
units. Those units saw that in order to attract men
to the Savior who would come among them, it
would be necessary to set an appointed time for his
advent, and that all should be instructed as to the
method and purpose of His coming, even fixing the
exact day, month, and year of the birth, as well as
the exact date of the crucifixion.
“This was not only necessary in order to give His
teachings greater weight and vitality, but it was nec­
essary to bring humanity’s thoughts back to a focal
or central point, as the majority were wandering
entirely after strange gods. Humanity had gone so
far afield, that spiritual death was imminent. Thus
it was proclaimed that the body of the Messiah or
Savior would be slain and that his body would he
placed in a rock-hewn tomb, and a complete resur­
rection would follow. Thus humanity would again
be shown that they could turn from being the ‘sons
of men’ and become the Sons of God,—the Christ
of God always dwelling One with God. Thus by
living the God life, man would never go back into
the welter; peace and good will would reign on
earth. It was also written that that condition did
exist and was before all things and that He would
teach them man’s true heritage. Thus He did exist
and was the Hidden One of the ages; and through
the precepts that He taught, flowed the fountain of
God’s providence and the full fruits of the earth
that were for man’s free use.
“These prophecies had become paganized and
subverted before the advent of Jesus; and this sub­
version has extended to this day, leading many to
believe that the basic elements of Christianity had
[166]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
been borrowed from previous religions, instead of
knowing that it has always stood forth and accom­
plished humanity’s highest ideal.
“The body of the mother, the one who would
bring forth and nourish this Christ child, and the
body of the father who would stand as a physical
protector, were also prepared for this immaculate
birth, each complete yet united as one, to watch
over this child who would grow into maturity
among those he would teach.
“The mother was Mary and the father was
Joseph, both representing the descendants of David,
the true light-bearer; from the seed of Abraham,
meaning Ah Brahm, the bearer of the completed
light from the great Cosmos.
“The sons of man had reverted so low in the
scale, that the vibrations of their bodies were below
those of the animal. By stepping forth and pre­
senting the long-forgotten Christ, He knew full well
they would attempt to ravage his body in a greater
degree than the animal would. Unless human per­
ceptions are guided by the Christ light, they will
sink lower than the animal.
“He knew He must be so definitely at-one with
the Christ in His dominion, that they could not
touch Him unless He chose. Thus, He was fear­
less in choosing the role. Such an One choosing
this role must be humble, knowing fully that such
is the role that all have followed through their
Christ life.
“This gathering consolidates this ideal more defi­
nitely. You can observe the silent influence wielded
through the thousands of humble souls gathered
here. You can calculate this fully by taking for the
basis of your deductions, the fact that one man
standing forth in his Godhead, giving forth in full­
est measure, conquers the world, and death is no
[167]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
more. Add to this the influence of one more who is
as powerful, the influence of the two is fourfold
greater than the one. Then multiply this by the
numbers gathered here and you can realize the
power that is radiating forth to the whole world
from this multitude.
“With such a power center in full radiation, the
world is reborn, revitalized and renewed instantly,
whether the units of humanity realize it or not.
Such an assembly has gathered in stated locations
throughout the world every twelve years, far down
the ages, long before Neptune threw off her mantle
of God. Their numbers were less in the earlier
days, but the radiations going out from the group
have attracted others without an audible word being
spoken.
“The first small group grew into a multitude;
then one from that multitude formed another group,
and so on, until twelve groups were formed; and
this is the twelfth or last group, making thirteen in
all. This group has assembled to consolidate and
unite the twelve with the first group, making thir­
teen united into one complete gi’oup, yet meeting
as the original groups have met, in different places,
to facilitate the accessibility of the assem­
bling places.
“There is no attempt at definite organization;
neither are there any hard and fast rules adhered
to. It is only organized as each individual is or­
ganized within, and, through that organization,
is drawn to one of the groups. The location of
the assemblies has never been revealed to people
in general, which proves that there has been no at­
tempt at organization.
“The assembly which will gather at twelve o’clock
tomorrow, will fully consolidate all the groups un­
der the first group, the twelve building a pyramid
[ 168]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
symbolizing the completion of the Christ ideal in
man, the thirteenth constituting the capstone or
crown.
“All the thirteen groups will assemble as sepa­
rate groups, in the same location as before; yet the
assembling of one or all of the groups will be the
same as though all were meeting with the head
group, which will be accomplished tomorrow.
“Aside from just accomplishing for consolida­
tion of the thirteen groups into one group, twelve
from each of the twelve groups will go out to as­
sist in forming twelve more groups. Multiply this
by twelve, which will be one hundred and forty-four
groups. When these groups are augmented by other
units of humanity, they will again branch out into
groups of twelve. Thus a pyramid formed of
groups in the order of twelve will be erected until
it encompasses the earth.
“The only requisite necessary to become one or
a part of these groups is first to present the Christ
ideal to yourself, then give forth Christ to the world
in thought, word and deed. You are then one with
this whole great group, and where you meet God,
they must meet with you, in your home, your own
sanctuary, be it in the most remote part of the
world, on the mountain peak, or in the busy marts
of trade. One with God is the determining factor
always. The instant you lift your thought to the
Christ, your body responds to the Christ vibration;
then you respond to the same vibratory influence
that is emanating from this vast throng, and the
multiplied energy of its numbers picks up your
Christ ideal and spreads it broadcast to the whole
world, and our influence is carried on and on with
the combined whole in a great tidal wave of
thought
“Thus, instead of remaining in the former seclu-
[169]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
sion, these precepts will become world-wide. To
such a group there need be no head, save the Great
Godhead of the whole human race; no form, no
sect, no creed is necessary.
“Declare you are the Christ and command the
self to live true to this ideal concept in thought,
word and deed; thus you do conceive and bring
forth the Christ. These vibrations once established
are never diminished, thought the unit or individual
be unconscious of their existence; but if you keep
on and on, you will become conscious of these vi­
brations—which is a far greater experience than any
other could be. Thus the focal point which is estab­
lished, is true and can never be erased; and to this
point every human unit must eventually come. To
such the whole wide vista of the Universe is opened,
and there are no restrictions added to or imposed
upon the individual. The vista imposed by the hu­
man vision may be outside these vibrations, but it
may be brought within the range of vibratory vi­
sion. There may not appear to be an individual here
within the vibratory ray which the human vision
imposes, but each is here; and we recognize him.
You who have walked or ridden all the way, have
at times glimpsed this fact, or you would not be
here.
“With such a united humanity, can the battle of
Gog and Magog or Armageddon be fought? Can
man-made manifestations of law bring forth a force
that will trample over God Law, which is ruling
above and co-existing with all force? Here but one
God-man need say ‘NO’ and it will be accomplished,
as all are in unison and respond in unison. No
force need be exerted. The force to harm that those
in the lower vibrations are sending out, can be con­
centrated and returned to them with true love and
blessing. If they resist, they will but destroy them-

selves; and those who are returning the love force,
need not so much as lift a hand.
“These groups stand as the Great Pyramid has
stood, indestructible down through the ages, as a
witness, in stone, to humanity that the Christ in
man was fully established long before man’s advent,
and that man as the Christ has never been separated
from the Godhead. That this Great Pyramid is such
a witness is fully established by its age and purity
of form, construction, and intellectual value. It
has been preserved and mentioned as the Great Py­
ramid throughout milleniums. All the scientific
information that is imbedded in the huge mass, was
not placed there for the advancement of science, as
men must be well versed in science in order to in­
terpret its knowledge.
“Its great antiquity and wonderful structure
have set it aside as a mystery to mankind. Within
its mass is exposed the secret of the Universe; each
delineation is in precise terms and methds of exact
science. This was pre-ordained and is working
toward the harmonious consummation of man
standing forth as the Christ of God, completely
amalgamated with God. The culmination of this ac­
complishment will place the capstone upon the
Great Pyramid.”

CHAPTER XVIII
A
S THE RISHI finished, a number of people
walked toward our camp and Jesus was in
“ the group. We had noted that they had
gathered on the slope of the ridge a short distance
from the camp, but had supposed that they were
gathering for a private conference, as these gath­
erings were in evidence all about the countryside.
As they approached, Weldon arose, stepped for­
ward, and clasped both of Jesus’ hands. There was
no need for an introduction, as they were all close
friends of the Rishi and Jesus. As for ourselves, we
felt like little atoms ready to take root in any niche
where soil presented itself.
All gathered around our campfire. Weldon asked
Jesus if he would talk to us of the Bible. This met
with a most hearty approval from all, and Jesus
began:
“Let us consider David’s prayer in the twenty-
third psalm, ‘The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want.’ You will note this was not a prayer of sup­
plication. Do you not see that the real meaning
implies that the One great Principle is leading us
into the way we should go, or Great Principle goes
before on our pathway, and thus we make the
crooked places straight? This Principle prepares
our pathway as a shepherd does for his trusting
and dependent sheep; thus we can say, ‘Where Our
Father leads I am unafraid.’
“The good shepherd knows where everything is
located that is good for his sheep; thus we can say,
‘I shall not want.’ With David we can say ‘I can­
not want,’ for I AM is guarded against every ill.
“Every want of our physical nature is supplied.
Not only shall we be well fed in the green pastures,
[172]
but there will be an abundance to spare. We rest
in complete assurance that every desire is already
fulfilled and provided for. We can let go of every
weary sense and say, one with David, ‘He maketh
me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me
beside still waters.’ The blue of their quiet depths
gives great peace to our minds and our troubled
consciousness is stilled.
“With body and mind at rest, the heavenly inspi­
ration of the most high Principle floods our souls
with the pure light of life and power. The light
within us glows with the glory of my Lord, the law
wherein we are all one. This radiant light of spirit
renews our understanding; we stand revealed to our
true selves, so that we know ourselves as one with
the Infinite and each is sent from this Principle to
manifest the perfection of the Father Principle. In
the quiet calm of our souls, we are restored to our
pure selves and know that we are whole; thus, ‘He
restoreth my soul. Yea though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.'
In the fullness of the bounty of this God Principle,
what can we fear? Here we rest our physical na­
tures, God quiets our minds, God rests our souls,
God illumines us for service; therefore with this
perfect preparation from within, what other tests
could cause us to fear that any evil thing could
harm us? God is in the midst of every one of us;
to each he is an ever-present help in time of trouble.
In Him we live and move and have our being. We
say with one voice ‘All is well.’
“Now each can say, ‘God love leads me directly
into the fold. I am shown the right path and cor­
rected when I stray from this fold. The power of
God love attracts me to my good; thus all that
would harm is shut from me.’
“Now with David each can say, ‘For thou art
[173]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.’
“In first taking up this work and perceiving the
truths or the fundamental scientific facts under­
lying all life and the way of attaining thereto, you
take the first step, and the exhilaration and enlight­
enment are so far beyond anything you have hith­
erto experienced that you decide to go on in the
work. Then doubts, fears, and discouragements are
allowed to creep in, and your on-going seems to He
retarded. You struggle first one way, then another,
and you seem to be losing ground. The struggle
seems to be too great for human beings to accom­
plish, and you begin to look at the failures all about
you.
“You say God’s children are dying on every
hand,’ and none within your generation have ac­
complished the ideal of everlasting and eternal life,
peace, harmony, and perfection which I idealize.
You say that accomplishment must come after
death; so you let go and find for a time that it is
much easier to drift on and on with the human tide
on the downward trend.
“Again the race consciousness has had another
setback; another who had a great spiritual enlight­
enment and understanding, and could have suc­
ceeded, has failed, and the race consciousness has
another binding hold upon humanity. Generation
after generation gives it a still greater and tenacious
grip. Is it any wonder that human nature becomes
weak and frail; and each in turn follows on and on,
in the same eternal treadmill, the blind following
the blind, on and on into eternal oblivion; and into
the great vortex, where not only the body is forced
into dissolution and decay, but the soul is ground
between the never-relenting millstones of human
perception and mistakes?
“If you would realize as I did, and as so many
[174]
have done, that it is far easier to work out your own
problem in one earthly experience than it is to go
on and on and accumulate a race consciousness of
good and evil, that soon becomes an encrusted shell;
that has been added to, layer by layer, upon an en­
crustation by each succeeding experience, until it
takes superhuman force and sledge-hammer blows,
to break the shell and release your true self.
“Until you do break the shell, and release your
true self, you will continue to be ground in the same
vortex. You can work until you have released your­
self sufficiently to get a glimpse of the horizon’s
‘grander view.’ Here again you cease to struggle,
your mental vision is cleared, but your body is still
encased in the shell. Realize, that the newborn
chick, when its head is free from its shell, must still
go on with the struggle. It must be entirely free
from its old shell or environment, before it can
grow into the new, which it has sensed and per­
ceived as soon as it had broken a hole through the
shell once encasing the egg from which it grew.
“You fail utterly to see, that I, as a boy working
at the carpenter’s bench with my father, perceived
that there was a higher life for the God-born so-
called human being, than to be born into a human
existence for a short time and during that short
existence, be ground between the millstones of man­
made laws, superstitions, and conventions, and thus
struggle on through that existence for perhaps three
score years and ten, then pass on to a heaven and a
glorious reward of harps and psalm singing, that
could have no logical existence except in the gullible
minds of those preyed upon by the priesthood of
my day.
“You fail utterly to see, that after this great
awakening or realization within myself, it took long
days and nights of struggle in seclusion and silence,
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
[175]
THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
all alone, right within myself and with myself. Then
when the self was conquered, it took the far greater
and more bitter experiences of personal contact
with those I loved dearly, and to whom I wished to
show the light that I had perceived; knowing it was
the light that burns so brightly, lighting the path of
every child of God that is created or that comes
into the world.
“You fail utterly to see the great temptation that
beset me to go on and be the carpenter I might have
been, and thence live the short span of life allotted
to man by hierarchy and orthodoxy; instead of tak­
ing up a life which perception had only given me a
glimpse of, thus allowing me to see through the
murk and mire of superstition, discord, and dis­
belief.
“You fail utterly to follow the bodily anguish,
the ignominous insults that were heaped upon me
by my own kin alone, aside from those to whom I
strove to show the light I had perceived. You failed
to see that this took a will stronger than my own,
which sustained me through these trials. How little
you can know of the trials and struggles, tempta­
tions, and defeats that beset me. How at times, I
struggled on and on with clenched fists and set
teeth, seeing and knowing that the light was there;
although there seemed to be but one last flickering
ray, and at times it seemed that that last ray had
gone out and a shadow was cast in its place. Even
then, something within me was ever strong and
dominant, that, back of the shadow, the light was
as bright as ever. I went on and cast aside the shad­
ow and found the light burning even brighter be-
caus of the temporary dimming. Even when the
shadow proved to be the cross; and I could see be­
yond, the final awakening of a triumphant mom
that passed beyond the understanding of mortal
man, still immersed in fear, doubts, and supersti-
[176]
TEACHING OF THE MASTERS OF THE FAR EAST
tions. It was the very urge of this perception that
sent me on, determined to drink the cup to the
fullest draft, that I might know by actual experience
and contact, whereof I spoke; that man by the free
will of God, coupled with his own free thought and
pure motive, could prove for himself alone, that God
is divine; and that man, His true son, born in His
image and likeness, is as truly divine as the Father
is divine; and that this divinity is the true Christ
that every man sees and perceives, is in himself and
in all of God’s children.
“This true Christ is the light that lights every
child that comes into the world. It is the Christ of
God our Father, in, through, and by whom we all
have everlasting life, light, love, and true brother­
hood—the true Fatherhood, the true Sonship, of
God and man.
“In the light of this true understanding or Truth,
you do not need a king, a queen, a crown, a pope or
a priest. You in the true perception, are the king,
the queen, the pope, the priest; and none but your­
self and God stand alone. You expand this true pre-
ception to take in the whole Universe of form and
shape; and with your God-given creative ability,
you surround them with the perfection that God
sees and surrounds them with.”

ADDENDUM
The word A rya means cultured, refined, noble.
Aryavarta was the land wherein the people gave
great heed to race culture.
Arya-bliava was the ancient name for the highest
virtue.
Arya-marga was the path to noble life.
These precepts had been handed down through
eons of time.
In ancient India, culture was most human in its
outlook, the thought being ‘great men for a great
country’; hence we find a great people, complete
brotherhood, true love and reverence for each hu­
man unit, truly humble souls knowing that all are
God. This could in no way become another name
for strife and contention; it must become the domi­
nant factor in its essential relationship toward the
building of true world consciousness.
The Aryans dreamed and philosophised; yet their
dreams were most real. They not only dreamed of
God, they knew that God was actually enthroned in
the hearts and lives of all mankind, as the true and
beautiful in every human unit.
Is there an intelligent man that does not have
such a philosophy, a viewpoint or attitude toward
the world? What better attitude could there be than
viewing the world through the eyes of the God-
man? Is it not through this attitude that all hu­
manity lives richer and more harmonious lives?
The Aryan message is, “Build up your manhood
and womanhood and you build up all humanity.”
By so doing, you avoid the so-called sins against the
body. Through the accomplishment of this ideal,
you realize the supreme opportunity of earth’s pil­
grimage and with the right sense of proportion, the

rich powers of youth are laid as an offering at the
Mother’s Shrine. Thus, you find the key to the king­
dom of heaven right within your own soul, just as
you did a thousand or a million years back and will
do in the years to come.
This can be accomplished here and now; or you
can go on and plow through materiality on its net­
work of roads and through its network of thoughts,
until you eventually reach the same central white
light which is again Spirit, the Christ in every one,
the truth made manifest unto you. This is the ulti­
mate for all races, all creeds, all religions, the
Fatherhood and Motherhood of God.
Once self-mastery is attained, the Master leads
on and on, ever on.
The Aryan manhood guarded Aryan culture. The
Aryan womanhood has been the greatest guardian
of this culture. All through the ages, she has nour­
ished the moral, social, and political life; her intui­
tions and mysticism of sympathy has always stood
as the great bulwark of the Aryan Ideal.
Aristotle asked that an Indian teacher versed in
the ancient teachings and culture of India, be
brought to him,—a teacher that in the noblest sense
could be called a true man, physically strong, intel­
lectually and morally refined.
It is God’s promise that prayer is always an­
swered. “I say unto you, Ask and it is given unto
you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it is opened
unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and
he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketli,
it shall be opened.”
In other words, the Christ admonishes us,
Principle says ‘Yes,’ refuse to take ‘No.’ ” No does
not have its origin in God but in our own failure to
believe in God’s promise. The God-promise to man
Tiigr fails, but how few can stand the test of
[179]
knowing. How few can meet every trial by knowing
God, until the Christ of God is released within them.
What an invitation to constantly know God;
what an appeal for definiteness and persistency.
God Principle always bears with its own, those
ready to receive the highest understanding. As they
cry out for deliverance from their adversaries, they
know it is only for their further purification and
enlightenment. Thus they realize that the adver­
sary is a friend, as the adversary compels their un­
ceasing search for God Principle.
The promise is, “Principle cannot break its own
law.” We ask for strength to erase the evil thought
that law can be broken, or that there is a power
that can oppose God Power. As God is all Power,
God must answer prayer.
GOD IS THE ONLY WORD. IT CANNOT FAIL.
