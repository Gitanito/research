As I began to wake up, I realized I was having asthma. I slowed my breathing so the wheezing wouldn't get worse.  All of a sudden, my body was paralyzed from the neck down. I could move my head but could not move my arms or legs or - my diaphragm. Unable to breathe in or out at all, I struggled for breath until I didn't need to breathe anymore. 

At that moment, a great peace came over me. My head fell over to the right and down, and my consciousness (soul?) lifted to the right and up to the corner of the room, where I watched what was happening below. I thought about my two grown sons, neither of whom I had told about the surgery. It was an indifferent, wondering feeling to think how surprised they would be to learn I was dead. I watched as the two nurses near me suddenly realized there was a problem. 'Look at those splotches on her face!' 'She's not breathing!' 

Then there was a flurry of activity as they called for the anesthesiologist. They pressed on my chest to resuscitate me. I started breathing again, was suddenly back in my body, and they were injecting adrenaline into my groin.
