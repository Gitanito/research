  		              		Experience Description   

  I was thrust into a black void that felt really good. I had no body, no sense of touch, nor smell or taste. But, I could somehow feel an intense peaceful, joyful feeling in an endless black void. When I thought, 'Well this is nice, but I'm not ready yet.' Then,  I thought of my parents. I came back to my body and was then breathing again, in the real world.
