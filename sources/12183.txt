  		              		Experience Description   

    While working for a private security company as an armed guard at a New Orleans Public Library. I was outside the front of the library in the street, and heading back into the library when someone from behind calls out something to get my attention. I turn around to find myself staring down the barrel of a 9mm handgun. I then turned around with my hands up, unable to draw my weapon or seek any kind of cover. I was totally screwed! I started to put distance between myselfand the assailant by walking slowly to the sidewalk.
  
  I was commanded, "Stop, or I will shoot you!"  I replied, "Don't do that!" and I took a step or two more. That was when the first shot went off—missing me. I made a run for the library's front door. The second shot went off, hitting me in the back and sending me flying through the large doorway. Then my adrenaline kicked in and there I was standing up, brandishing my weapon. I was looking around everywhere for my assailant. But then I stumbled, falling backwards. The next thing I knew, someone was grabbing me from behind and pulling me into the library. Then the third shot went off, just missing me and my rescuer. I was moved into the main area of the library. There was pure chaos, with children crying and people yelling. My rescuer was still putting pressure with a towel on my wound when the police finally arrived. I felt weak but was able to give a description of the assailant. Soon the emergency medical technicians arrived by ambulance, and they hurried me off to the emergency room.
  
  The next thing I knew, I was in a sort of 'black box,' like a very dark void. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I was aware of "myself," Steve, but I didn't seem to have a physical body. I was wondering where I was with all this blackness surrounding me—but I was definitely aware of myself. Next appeared a vertical line of bright, white light, from the highest to the lowest point in front of me. The light started to open, as a door would. Two heads stuck out through the emergent opening and were peering at me. They were not too close, but not too far away. I struggled to focus on them. One of the Beings appeared to be wearing a white hat and the other Being, a black hat. Both Beings had large black eyes. Finally, both Beings slowly withdrew the way they had entered, through the contracting "doorway" of light, which then closed completely. The bright light dissipated. Only darkness remained.
  
  I woke up in the intensive care unit.
