  		              		Experience Description   

    I woke in a hospital bed, without the energy  to even grow a fingernail.  It took me maybe 15 minutes to be able to get the buzzer to alert medical staff of my condition.
  
  They immediately responded with a crash cart and more staff than you could fit into the room.  During this early intervention time, I left my body.  I didn’t see myself in bed, but I left the body for sure.
  
  I went to a place where I had no body and drifted in space above a hard flat surface. I was a long way off the ground.  I was drifting while being suspended but still wide awake and very aware of my surroundings.
  
  I was above a sky filled with individually colored drops like the candy of liquorish or differently  colored candies with  chocolate inside.   There were millions and millions of them coming from the right to the left above me and filling the sky.  Actually, they were the sky.  Athough I was far above,  I could see each one individually as they were  pushed or making their way across the sky.  I could have watched them for hours and hours.  
  
  I could move by just thinking about being somewhere different.  The chocolate multi-coloured drops were moving to a point in the sky where they were falling down, like  a waterfall.  They were dropping from a long way up as a wall of multicolored drops falling into into a large gap in the ground below me.
  
  I moved closer to the edge of the gap and peered over the edge.  I couldn’t see a bottom at all, as millions of these candies fell down from the sky to the bottom of the waterfall, somewhere deep below me.
  
  The experience was amazing.  I would return to that place today, anytime without hesitation if it was offered to me.

  In total, I was away for maybe two or three hours.
  
  I later learned that the medical staff had to remain in my room for the entire morning.  Someone was watching me without pause or break for hours and hours.  
  
  I didn’t move in my physical body for about four maybe five hours during this medical event.
