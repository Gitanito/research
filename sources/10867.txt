Suddenly I could see my upper body rise and sit upright.

It was dark, and very still, with nothing around me except my deceased mother, on the other side of an invincible fence. She couldn't find my deceased brother and was waiting for me to go to her side of the fence so we can look for him together. Then I was awaken by the banging on my door and taken to the hospital.
