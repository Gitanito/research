  		              		Experience Description   

    It was week 34 of the pregnancy. I was hospitalized for preclampsia. On the third day, I began to feel sick. I hurt all over.  Everyone was running around and they were going to do an urgent C-section. When they did the ultrasound, I began to see an intense and brilliant light. I said, 'The light, The light!' The doctor said, 'Open your eyes Alejandra.'

   Then I went through this light.  I had a  feeling of extreme happiness, unmatched peace, and a feeling of universal love. I think I was in this state for about 45 minutes. I didn't see anyone in the light but I experienced happiness as I had never  felt before. 

   When I came back, my daughter had been delivered and they were suturing me with just a little anaesthesia. During the 'loss of consciousness,' as the medics called it, I felt a lot of pain.
  
  A year passed and another premature baby came. I wanted more time to care for my children and I looked for part time work. I was in charge of carrying out examination tests in a clinic. I had a patient with dementia, who never met my gaze with his. He brought his disabled daughter and we both talked for a long time. They let me know when they would come every month for the tests. I would look be  looking for a taxi with a wheel chair. The years passed, and I was promoted  to the boss of the laboratory.  I received a phone call and it was the daughter of my patient. Between tears she told me that she would no longer come with her father because  he had died. She was very sad. Due to her disability, she hadn't been able to help him at the moment when he had the attack. I tried to comfort her, telling her about my NDE and said to her that when her father was to die, he went into the beautiful and fantastic light. He was feeling no pain and that everything was beautiful. Ten on hearing my story she started to cry and she said to me that she had dreamed of her father, and that he had  said to her in her dreams ,  'Talk to  Alejandra who has something to tell you.' Now she was so sure that this was what I had to told her, so she could have peace with the death of her father. She said to me that she would go immediately to visit the cemetery to tell him that she had now talked to me and her anguish had been relieved.
