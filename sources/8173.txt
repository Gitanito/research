I also had organ (kidney) failure and traumatic brain injury due to oxygen deprivation. I was not expected to live, but I came back completely healed from my lupus after my NDE. I have been totally well since, with no trace of Lupus since 2005. I was sent back well! 

I may have been clinically dead, as I had no brain function according to a scan. I was not expected to live and when I was disconnected from the respirator, I was suddenly in a dimly-lit room by myself.  I noticed, in particular, that this room had a door, which I felt was special in some way. Then I became aware that I was no longer alone. God was there! I felt God as an all-encompassing presence, complete total and unconditional love in its highest form!  

Even though I saw no figure, there was no doubt in my mind that this was God. Then He spoke, and it was with such compassion: He said, 'Are you too tired?' I knew He was asking me if I was too tired to go through that door. Through that door would be my death. I do not recall my answer, whether God sent me back, or if I made the decision, but I do know I was given a choice. So it must have been my choice to come back. Miraculously, God sent me back WELL!! After many years of severe suffering with the pain and illness of lupus, when I came back, my lupus was completely gone! Since my NDE, all tests for lupus come up clear! This has been true every single day since my NDE.

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes  Illness  I may have been Clinically dead as I had no brain function on scan and was not expected to live when I was disconnected from the Respirator.  'Life threatening event, but not clinical death' I may have been Clinically dead as I had no brain function on scan and was not expected to live when I was disconnected from the Respirator.  I had lupus and was in a severe flare up. I did not feel well after work, so I went to the emergency room.  When I was with the nurse, I suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage and was coughing up blood. I choked and then couldn't breathe. The last thing I said was, 'I can't breathe, please help me.' Then I passed out. They took me to the Intensive Care Unit and put me in a drug-induced coma to help get oxygen in me. My brain swelled and showed no function due to oxygen deprivation. Later I was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and possible stroke. I also had kidney failure. They gave me dialysis, plasma-phoresis and chemo. I was not expected to live. My family even gave away my pets. While I was unconscious I had an NDE.   When they took me off the respirator I surprised everyone by sitting up and talking, even with the tracheotomy tube still in my throat. I have had no trace of lupus since my NDE and am well now, although I did need a lot of rehab for the brain damage.

I knew that was His way of giving me the choice of going with Him, to my death.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No   There was a door to death but I did not go through it.

  Experience Description 6288  					</p>  					I believe there was so little hope for my survival that my pets were even given away. I had years of joint pain from Lupus, having a hard time walking, working.  I was always in pain and very tired. One day at work, I felt so ill that I stopped at the emergency room after work. As I was speaking to the nurse, I coughed and was hemorrhaging blood. My lungs filled up. The last thing I remember saying was to the Nurse, ‘Help me, I can't breathe’. Then I thought, 'OH! Is this my Death?' I was surprised. I had not planned to die that day, just go to work. Then I guess I passed out. They got me to the Intensive Care Unit; put me on a respirator and into a drug-induced coma to get Oxygen into me. I had dialysis and plasma-phoresis. All I remember from the coma was worrying about my cats. I knew I was in the hospital, and I was wondering how I could get out of bed, get to my car and go home to feed my cats. I did not know that I had by then be transferred to another hospital. I also did not know that since I was not expected to live, my cats had already been given away.

Next, I was suddenly in a room that was rather dim. I was alone, and there was a door there. Somehow, I knew that if I went through that door, I would die. Then I was no longer alone. God was with me. He was a warm, loving presence of complete Love. It was joy to be with Him. But He was just a presence, no figure; but there was No Doubt that this was God. Then He spoke. He said, ‘Are you too tired?’ I knew that He was asking me if I wanted to come with Him, through that door, and on to death. I don't recall my answer. I don't know to this day, if I asked to come back or He sent me back. I came back, and I came back to a Miracle. 

They disconnected the Respirator. They still had the tracheotomy in my throat, and suddenly I surprised them all by sitting up and talking! I said, 'Why am I speaking like this?' I was speaking gravelly. They took out the tracheotomy. From the Brain Damage, I had to have years of therapy to speak, dress myself, dial a phone, do basic things. For a time I had to live in a nursing home until I could dial a phone walk again and dress myself. My Kidneys came back, and so did my brain. I now am retired, as I could not work. I have  some issues now with dyslexia and math and telling time, but my speech is perfect, I live alone, drive, pay bills and even can Write (I am a writer). Best of all, God sent me back in perfect health; I have 8 years now completely free from Lupus. I am healed. I believe, but the docs make me see them frequently to keep an eye on me. I know I have been granted a Miracle and that I am well and I no longer have Lupus. Also, besides Kidney failure, I was also granted a miraculous recovery from Liver failure caused by Tylenol. Another one the docs can't explain. When that happened they said I'd be gone in a few days if I didn't get a transplant, but the next day, they said, ‘your liver is coming back!’ My liver has been just fine, too. Anyway, it's all in my medical records if you are interested. I am a lucky woman. I had faith in God when this happened, but now my faith is much deeper, because I know now that He exists and works Miracles today for people the same day He did when He was on earth. I read Anita Moorjani's book and decided to post my story on your site after I read hers. Maybe my story can help someone who suffers from Lupus.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No   I am not sure. I know I was given a say in the decision by God. I knew that the door, if I went through it with God, meant I would die. I don't recall if He sent me back or if I asked to go back.

What is your religion now?       Christian- Catholic

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I thought when you went to heaven, people came to get you (dear departed) or maybe you saw Jesus, or went through a tunnel and a light, but none of that happened to me so it was not what I thought of previously of what a near-death expreience was or what people had talked about or imagined.

I know all is in God’s hands and I don't worry about my health any more. I came back about the same except more faithful.  I have a need to tell people that God is real. I want to be more compassionate but I think about the same, still a regular person with the usual feelings, challenges emotions and problems any person has. I am still me!

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?     Yes   Yes I like people of faith or those who've had a spiritual journey. My friends and family are still the same. Not everybody likes talking about God so I have some new friends who are more comfortable talking about such topics.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience   I recall every detail with total clarity it had never faded,

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Uncertain     I have had a few spiritual gifts since I came back. I have been granted ‘The peace of God that passes all understanding,’ which is a favor that is hard to explain to people unless you have experienced it, but just occasionally.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Only it is nice to know that God is real and I am so grateful that He granted me a miracle of complete healing from Lupus after all these years; recovery from the brain damage and also gave me back my kidneys and liver. It is wonderful that He sent me back well.  I don't think People have to die to get this. I now am sure that they need only believe, and ask, and there is a good chance God will answer their prayers. I didn't understand this before. As long as it does not oppose His will, and he is Kind, He does answer prayer. I know this from experience now since I have been back.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Some people it seems to mean a lot, but others are skeptical. I can understand that to them it is just a story and they are not able to hear the fact that God exists. But I always hope that maybe a seed of wondering has been planted, and maybe in their time of need, they might think if turning to God and giving Him a try. Maybe they will recall how well it worked out for Anne! I told people right away as soon as I could talk. It seems I have a need to tell people about it.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   I read that Moody book once. That was why I was surprised mine was not like that book.  I saw no tunnel, light, angels, or dearly departed.  It was just me and God in a room with a door. Not even Jesus, just a presence.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     Well, I just knew it was real. I had no doubt at all about it. Also, the fact that I lived and came back completely well in a way that even the doctors used the word ‘Miracle’, well, I knew. In fact, when I could talk one of the ICU docs came in and said, ‘Anne, we had a little trouble with you.’ I said, ‘Thank you, Doctor, for saving my Life.’ He replied, ‘I didn't save your life. I couldn't. God saved your life.’

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     Nobody can really explain why I am in complete remission from Lupus since I came back. The medical students like to meet me, they always say in kind of a shocked voice: ‘I looked at your chart!’ and I laugh and tell them, ‘I am a Miracle and I know it!’

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       God is Love and Loves me. It is important now for me to tell people that God is real and He exists. I thought when you went to heaven, people came to get you (dear departed) or maybe you saw Jesus, or went through a tunnel and a light, but none of that happened to me.  It was not what I thought of previously of what a near-death experience was or what people had talked about or imagined. I recall every detail with total clarity it has never faded.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Wow. It was long! Hard to finish. I apologize for any typing mistakes, it is still very hard for me but I am done and thanks, I enjoyed it.
