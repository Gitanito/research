here we are welcome back everyone
I&#39;m dr. experiment Greer I&#39;m here with
renowned a constitutional attorney and
civil rights attorney Daniel Sheehan and
Danny and I&#39;ve known each other since
the 90s and he&#39;s helped us with the
disclosure project many of you saw him
at the National Press Club event in 2001
and he of course is also in this movie
Close Encounters of the fifth time and
given some great information to people
so we&#39;re very honored to have mr.
Sheehan here thank you very much for

population and meditation and unity to
make this transition to a new
and that is still up so if you want to
contribute that ce-5 film.com is the
website a CD fight film calm so I think
that with those notes I will get right
into it and I just wanted to ask you
Danny are you your sort of you&#39;ve seen
the film I presume
oh yes and what are your thoughts about
it and aspirations well I think that the
the critical aspect of this particular
documentary in the series of those that
you&#39;ve done is making the link in a much
more clearer way than has been done in
the past between the the experience of
encountering extraterrestrial beings and
the spiritual evolution of our human
family I think that that&#39;s the key to
this whole thing as you know my some of
my initial contacts in this field
started when I was chief counsel for the
United States Jesuit Order in Washington
DC it was in that context that I was
contacted by the science and technology
division of the Library of Congress to
participate in the investigation in the
research that President Jimmy Carter I
wanted to undertake about the issue of
UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence
so it was from that seat in the Jesuit
headquarters the largest order and the
largest single denomination a spiritual
denomination and all of Western
civilization that I entered into this
particular process I had been involved
since a sense of child of course and in
experiencing the same I in wonder at the
nature of our universe and our place in
it and always viewed this as a an issue
of consciousness of our human family
when I when I first when I first
discovered around was only five years
old sitting out in the yard in my in the
grass or a yard and watching the Stars
come out realizing that these were star
systems with planets around them and
other beings a living and an entire
civilization out there I was kind of
floored about the fact that our human
family would engage in such
extraordinarily strange conduct as as
you&#39;re drawing lines in the dirt and
saying if you come on my side of the
line I&#39;m going to use my ingenuity to
dig minerals out of the earth and make
lead and sheet you with them and kill
you
and I was kind of astonished in light of
the stars or in the light of the stars
right that that we could engage in that
kind of lack of consciousness of the
real place that we have in the universe
and so I had been I had been fascinated
that the idea that other civilizations
existed in our galaxy and in our
universe and when I started hearing
about the phenomenon of these future
fiction movies we actually talked about
this there was a strange parallel track
of either treating the UFO beings the
extraterrestrial beings as horrible
threats that are coming here to eat you
or kill you or but there was this other
whole strain of people with Richard
Carlson playing the same lead over and
over again that somehow our human family
was reacting in a low consciousness
manner around through this experience
that remaining the Earth Stood Still
would like Iranian in those and it came
from outer space and these other movies
in the 1950s that that I was fascinated
about the ability of media to
communicate to our people the important
spiritual experience that we could have
with these beings so when I was
contacted when I was at the United
States Chatswood headquarters to
participate in helping to prepare a ke
secret top secret classified study for
President Carter about this I was I was
totally privileged to get to do that but
it led me into getting access to the
classified portions of Project Blue Book
which was the major top-secret
investigation that was underway by the
United States Air Force and when I
actually got to see the content of these
files it became absolutely evident that
there was in fact
this contact going on of these craft
coming to our planet and coming coming
into our airspace which I thought was
fabulous but it was clear that the
United States Air Force and that has
been assigned in this peculiar culture
that we&#39;re in to guard our airspace to
not allow any vehicles from any other
location than within our nation state to
come into our airspace that that whole
bizarre thing struck me as dangerous
they&#39;re pregnant that not only was it
failing to to take advantage of the
opportunity to actually raise our
consciousness into perceiving the place
that we have in the galaxy and in our
universe as a sentient species on this
particular planet but that in fact it
was dangerous because our human family
was actually threatening to engage in
activity at least a portion of us there
involved in the national security state
in attempting to shoot missiles and in
other kind of high-tech weapons of laser
beams and stuff at these vehicles to try
to to attack them so I I was involved
with Carol rosin and some other people
and trying to stop us from from taking
military weaponry into outer space I was
involved in trying to get the other 54
major religious denominations we have
offices in Washington DC to establish a
special task force to study this issue
and to understand what the relationship
is between our human consciousness and
the consciousness of these other beings
but they just weren&#39;t ready to do this
so I was I was glad that I was asked to
deliver a closed-door three-hour seminar
to the top 50 scientists at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena in the
SETI program about what the spiritual
implications were what the theological
implications were for our actually quote
discovering the existence of an
extraterrestrial civilization and so I
began to work out the kind of detailed
theology of
all of this and having to do with the
consciousness of our human family and
what it did is it it served as a mirror
to reflect back into us who we really
are and what our consciousness has to do
with our self-worth our sense of
entitlement as individuals to
participate in the democratic
decision-making processes for example
for our culture in our country and our
planet that and then I realized that the
the source of our most fundamental
rights as human beings are both in the
United States and our Constitution in
the Declaration of Human Rights in the
United Nations all of these find their
origin in the issue of consciousness
that to the extent to which we have a
more expanded consciousness to
understand who we are in the universe
and we can make decisions that set up
policies that are in harmony with our
real place in the universe and there we
can be friends with each other we don&#39;t
have to be competitive we don&#39;t have to
be confrontational
and so that our relationship with the
UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial
beings is in fact a microcosm of the
larger challenge that we face as a
sentient species that has evolved to the
spa of having an intellectual Faculty
the Latin root of intellect the
intellect being in electus the ability
to distinguish the difference between
ourselves and the rest of the creative
universe that has generated this great
experience of anxiety and alienation
from our integral relationship with the
rest of the universe and this is a plate
that we&#39;re trapped in right now
temporarily because it&#39;s a phase that we
have to go through you have to develop
your intellect in order to try to
overcome some of the challenges that we
face as human beings but we can&#39;t become
trapped there in the intellect
experiencing ourselves is separate and
apart from all the rest of creation and
so that the danger of our projecting
this onto each other
under people from other nation states
from other continents and now from other
planets and from other star systems is a
danger that we have to be able to make
our way through here right that&#39;s why I
think that the ce-5 process of actually
engaging regular people and reaching out
as ambassadors to the stars
is so important because it is how a very
dear friend of mine dr. james garrison
and i were involved in reaching out to
the Soviets during an extraordinarily
important period when dr. garrison was
my assistant at my staff person at the
Jesuit headquarters
dealing with the issue of nuclear
weapons and we work together to have him
go to Russia and actually meet orig
originally with Brezhnev and then was in
the process of getting ready to meet
with with anthroposophy Nazi no no you
want to meet Gorbachev Gorbachev is the
guy that&#39;s going to be the the new
president
so we can that with him and dr. Jim
Garrison went net with met with him
directly and we began the very first
thing I ever talked about with Gorbachev
when I met him that you know Sara Nelson
the executive director of our Institute
was actually the director of the state
of the World Forum at the end of the
Cold War with with with both President
Gorbachev and former Secretary of State
James Baker the third and the very first
thing I talked about when I met with
chapter the first time was about the
issue of extraterrestrial intelligence
it seemed like the perfectly obvious
important issue to start discussing and
so that this this has played a central
part in my consciousness since since
being a child before birth
what Gerta when I asked him you know he
speaks English but he won&#39;t speak
English in public and when I asked him
about please share with me the issue of
extraterrestrial intelligence and how
should we deal with this
the state of the world for him and he he
he pulled out this little pad of paper
and he wrote down the name of a person
in a telephone number for me to call and
I called the number and it turned out to
be the editor-in-chief of the only
Hebrew language newspaper in the Soviet
Union and I was a close friend of
Gorbachev&#39;s and when I when I contacted
knew I got to meet with him I told him
that you know that President Gorbachev
had recommended that I call him and he
started to laugh because he knew exactly
what it was about of course and and he
told about having an incident in in
Russia where outside of Moscow on a
Sunday afternoon back in the 1960s a UFO
actually came down above this big park
where you know hundreds of Russians were
out on a Sunday afternoon and saw this
thing and one man walked out into the
area to where the saucer was hovering to
try to communicate with them in this big
bright light a beam of light came out of
the cut saucer and the guy just
disappeared completely and the saucer
flew away and everybody was freaking out
and they started calling everybody you
know it was before cell phone so they
had to get the phones and somebody
called the newspaper and this guy got
the message and sent a reporter out
heard out to go out and interview some
of the people that were there and while
he was there the craft came back and
came back and it hovered and a big
bright light came out of it this beam
and the man reappeared in the beam of
light and in this this reporter reported
the entire thing to the publisher of his
newspaper and that was how he got to
know Gorbachev apparently and so that
that this is the this is what Gorbachev
said to me when I when I first met it
you know about this so I know how I know
how important this is and so that that I
when I had the opportunity
I was contacted by the Congressional
Research Service the science and
technology division under under
President Carter after he first actually
it was after he had been elected but
prior to his having been inaugurated
well that nerd I can&#39;t I drink that&#39;s
right which I&#39;m a briefing that refused
the Carter contacted him right away and
and the reason that George Bush Senior
was left in that position even as of
that time was because it&#39;s long I&#39;m
sorry but he refused to step down and he
until he was replaced in Jimmy Carter he
approached Jimmy Carter and said look if
you will please leave me on as the CIA
director I will promise never to run for
public office ever again I want to be
like Jagger Hoover is or was with regard
to the FBI where he stayed as the
director of the FBI one president after
another after another after another and
George HW Bush wanted to do that as the
CIA director which tells you something
about the importance of the the position
as compared to the president sort of
comes and goes every four to eight years
and and so Jimmy Carter told him no he
had his own man in mind that he was
going to put in which which actually was
going to be Teddy Sorensen originally
but their whole intelligence community
freaked out entirely and in in in
blackballed him from coming in because
they knew the minute he got there he was
going to ask start asking questions
about the Kennedy assassination and they
wouldn&#39;t allow him in there this is a
sound Stansfield Turner ended up
becoming the the CIA director of the DCI
and so the bottom line is when I got to
participate in that whole thing and got
to see in that capacity as a special
counsel to the investigation I got to
see the actual classified portions of
Project Blue Book and actually saw you
know there wasn&#39;t any doubt about what
they were I mean they were photographs
of
saucers are on the ground a saucer on
the ground and I once I saw that I
brought it back I brought I brought back
the information to father William Davis
who was my superior I was a candidate
for the Jesuit Order at that time and I
brought it back to father Davis on the
following Monday morning and I I told
him what I had found that I showed him
this famous thing where I traced the the
markings that were on the side of this
craft the writing on the ground right
yeah right there were those symbols that
were all along the base of it so I
showed it to him and what he did is he
bent over and he opened up the drawer of
his desk
and he took out this manila envelope and
handed it to me and I I opened it up and
I pull it and it was an eight and a half
by 11
black and white glossy photograph of a
UFO and it had been taken you could tell
it was taken out of the window of an
airplane the photograph and I said where
did you get this and he said my sister
Doty sent it to me and her husband Mike
is the air traffic controller in Seattle
Washington at the airport and one of his
best friends is a free flying pilot and
he saw this out of his window and he
took the photograph of it and in he when
he developed it he didn&#39;t dare turn it
into anybody because he thought he&#39;d get
in trouble you know then he could lose
his job
you know that was Bora an opening on the
issue of the national security state
here and because he was afraid and so he
said look at what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m
gonna take it and give it to my best
friend Mike who&#39;s the air traffic
controller it&#39;s Seattle here and then I
will have done my job he does he brings
it to Mike and so Mike gets the picture
of it and he doesn&#39;t dare tell anybody
about it because he&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll lose
his job and so what he does is he takes
it through his wife Dody and he gives
her the picture of what it is and he
says here take this to your brother he&#39;s
a priest
so you say wow I mean what does that
mean you know it means that means that
regular people experience the issue of
UFOs in extraterrestrial civilization as
having something to do
with the religious experience has
something to do with ray lagari the
Latin root Lai trailer real inking
re-linking us trapped here in our
intellect the separateness our Faculty
of separateness and religion is meant to
draw us back to relink us back to the
integral relationship that we have with
all created being
is it important at all from the
consciousness of means for demagogue yes
category Commons and superstition and
reading and fighting because of because
of our being trapped in the intellect
right and be trapped in this separate
fear filled alienated state of
consciousness right and so what we have
to do those of us that are involved in
ce-5 process is that we have to reach
out to people directly it&#39;s going to be
very difficult to go through the
institutions whether their institutional
religions or Institute&#39;s institutions of
government the United States Congress
the CIA you know the National Defense
establishment they aren&#39;t going to they
aren&#39;t going to respond to this way any
other than the famous Sufi saying that
when a pickpocket meets the saint
all he sees there is pockets mm-hmm
right and so that you know that we&#39;re
having that experience in in Richard
Dolan
you know dear Richard Dolan who&#39;s a
wonderful member of our whole community
the UFO and extraterrestrial
intelligence studying community has
prepared a whole two volumes of the UFO
phenomenon in the national security
state about how the national security
state has attempted to block any access
to this information and to block any
access to this direct experience with
the extraterrestrial beings because
they&#39;re so fearful that the revelation
of the existence of a civilization that
is so far in advance of us
technologically that our quote national
defense systems are helpless in the face
of them right now is so Anathem
to them that they&#39;re going to great
lengths to keep the people
finding out about this - finding out
about how helpless they really are and
what and you&#39;ve been you&#39;ve been one of
the leaders trying to reach out to these
people in the military establishment to
find individuals inside the
establishment that realize the
importance of this whole issue realize
that we have to do something other than
respond to them from as from a national
security state military type of response
and right now and so that we&#39;ve been
working on that and to get people who
are part of the military establishment
to participate in ce-5 experiences to
actually be able to realize that
reaching out with our consciousness to
these other beings to have the
telepathic communion with these other
beings and have them be able to come
into our space and in a friendly manner
is is obviously life-changing for
multiple I think they are people on
every story unless we remember in 1992
when we had this event early on it was
one of the early groups that I trained
and were on a beach in Florida and four
of the CT craft appeared in the sky and
ended up being on in the front page of
the Pensacola paper the next day well
within a very few days after this the
head of Army Intelligence approached me
and was very upset that we had figured
out how to do it which involves the
science of consciousness the deep
aspects of our spirit remote viewing
using consciousness and doing it within
the construct of universal peace we&#39;re
not doing it from the point of view were
wanting to get there technology as web
health but and that&#39;s why they respond
because they know we&#39;re doing this with
a pure heart with the correct intention
and philosophy
for that reason this man was very upset
and he basically said what the hell do
you think you&#39;re doing
I said well this is what we&#39;re doing and
I&#39;m not afraid of you I had a near-death
experience when I was 17 you kill me
that&#39;ll be your worst nightmare because
then I&#39;ll really be trouble the other
side and I said it&#39;s really yours and he
says to you like who the hell do you
think you are you say well I&#39;m just a
what I said I said I&#39;m a dancer I&#39;m a
citizen of the universe and you can&#39;t do
anything about it a few months later or
maybe it was about a two months later in
May of nineteen
personally two billion u.s. dollars if I
would shut up
and I said no I&#39;m not interested in your
money he then went through my wife and
tried to convince her and they were
desperate to put the lid on this and
everyone realizes the whole disclosure
project was an outgrowth of what
happened after it got publicly known by
the national security state that a group
of unfunded people this was out of the
goodness of their own intention had
successfully made contact this this
shook them to their foundation because
they realize this is the importance of
this ce-5 movie and we just have come
out with an app called the ce-5 contact
app or you can be trained to do the
meditation and remote viewing and form
your own team and there&#39;s a networking
and messaging function in there is that
enough people do this it creates this
morphogenetic field ship but it also
takes this out of their exclusive
control that&#39;s what their Dominion and
control over this issue would spoil like
sand through their fingers if I&#39;m not
people empowered themselves to be an
ambassador&#39;s teeth to these
civilizations and just basically leave
the National Security Statement
the key is atrophying that is to take
take withdrawing our power from them you
know so that we take our power under our
own hands we reach out ourselves that&#39;s
what dr. garrison and I did reach out
directly to Gorbachev to meet with them
and in fact that&#39;s exactly why Gorbachev
began blush toast
perestroika was pursuant to the meetings
that we were having with him to get him
just to disassemble that national
security state element and he entered
into an actual agreement with George
Bush Senior and James Baker the third
pursuant to which they agreed that if he
released all of the the Republic&#39;s in
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
and allowed them to go free that the
United States would not attempt ever
attempt to recruit them into NATO to
bring them in as military allies of the
United States in the george w bush
breached to that agreement completely
just blew it off and started bringing
them in one at a time one after another
into nato and they were going after the
ukraine to try to get a hold of crimea
which is the only warm water port that
this opinion even has it&#39;s absolutely
strategic you know what they were trying
to do and so his stopping them from
taking Crimea has generated this entire
fiction about oh you know he&#39;s taking
over other people&#39;s countries and trying
to attack them Rick the world and take
it over you know that&#39;s our job you know
doing that as George Carlin would say
you know so so that this is a national
security state having risen to the kind
of power that they have
after World War two and through the
National Security Act of 1947 creating
the Central Intelligence Agency later
going on to develop the National
Security Agency you know all of these
the discs the defense Industrial
Security Command all these different
alphabet organizations that are all part
of a secret state which is designed to
establish military hegemony over the
world and it&#39;s so blind and it&#39;s so
misdirected and it is so frightening to
the extraterrestrial beings because it
is the primary threat which has on the
other end of it not only not only the
potential thermonuclear war between the
nation-states but the global climate
change that the corporations that have
taken control over the economy and the
resources of our planet and just are
consuming them drawing them into the maw
of the of the industrial machine here on
our planet and even to the sacrifice of
our entire planet that is what a lot of
the et communications have been about as
you know the young children at Arial at
the school in Africa you know a you know
barber lamb the dear heart of the Shia&#39;s
of our whole community who has
interviewed
of people who have had the direct
contact experiences says that over 70%
of the people talk about the
extraterrestrial beings attempting to
try to persuade us to take care of our
planet to stop destroying the
environment to stop polluting the
environment and ruining our ecological
system this is a phony and what&#39;s
interesting and this most people don&#39;t
realize this I refer to it in the movie
we have a number of people who are
military guys who are at Strategic Air
Command nuclear silos and facilities and
a number of encounters happen and the
message they were receiving wasn&#39;t
what&#39;s been spun by you know people like
the T TSA and and others in the UFO
community when I first found those
military people who had top-secret
clearances they all told me that the
message they got from those events was
that the ETS were saying please don&#39;t
destroy this beautiful planet with these
weapons but if you were to launch all of
them we could disable an assault because
they literally took 18 to 20 a molten
warhead intercontinental ballistic
missiles with nuclear weapons on them
offline all it wants in this room I of
North Dakota what you find is that the
disclosure project I put all those
people together the then the mouthpieces
of xenophobia and hatred and alien
bashing jumped in intercepted those same
people and then went on the mashed
potato lecture circuit and on CNN
telling people see the aliens are hate
and a threat to our nuclear readiness
that&#39;s right they took what was actually
a message the villagers the children in
Africa got about please don&#39;t destroy
this beautiful planet int and spun it
that&#39;s where national security threat
well that&#39;s how can we deal with this in
the first part of the movie that you&#39;re
in where the Pentagon released this got
this footage of us chasing tic tacs or
whatever there&#39;s
UFOs off the coast of California and
every single media outlet that covered
it from the CNN York Times all we&#39;re
saying see there are threat to our
national security there is lady our
airspace invading airspace was all part
of an invasion on and I tell people this
is a real problem because we have to
have people who will come forward and
frankly call out that kind of spin that
is being scripted by the CIA and the
intelligence community to present this
as a threat when it is not one that&#39;s
what they&#39;re really here is what are
waiting for us to become mature enough
and enough to make peaceful contact with
them so we can go forward as a peaceful
world civilization but also a peaceful
interplanetary civilization make those
who take every event that happens and
spins it into this massive threat which
which is a complete hoax as Wernher von
Braun said this is a complete hoax but
unfortunately that&#39;s that is what the
mainstream media always covers whenever
this subject begins to come out on their
networks that&#39;s right
and we know that now we know that in
that we are in a position now where we
can communicate with our other fellow
human beings through the internet like
this and on the social media right and
share the information that&#39;s why this
this documentary that you&#39;ve done the
second one in the series that you&#39;ve
done about the the ce-5 the contacts of
a fifth kind you know this the Close
Encounters of a fifth time this is so
important for people to feel empowered
this is how we all participated in
bringing an end to the Cold War by
reaching out directly through citizens
diplomacy to reach out to the Soviet
Union to talk with them to bring them
here to the Esalen Institute to put them
into the hot tubs with other air fellow
astronauts this is how we do it so
they&#39;re reaching out to the
extraterrestrial beings through citizen
diplomacy right handful in Holland if it
were ambassadors to the Easterners
what&#39;s right and we have
no people to ask me I got challenged by
I won&#39;t say who but one of the
three-letter agencies yeah
it said yeah you don&#39;t have an official
yeah solid you need one I mean you know
they&#39;re here
we&#39;re here we&#39;re doing this like they
had a group back in the Cold War called
physicians for Social Responsibility
that went over to the Soviet Union to
create a Rock Pro small and a dialogue
during the darkest days of the Cold War
I said no that&#39;s with with millions of
people around the world reaching out in
a peaceful of paradigm to these
civilizations but also understanding
that the science of consciousness this
deep aspect of our innermost awareness
is this single ineffable oneness and
that these civilizations and and ETS are
sentient where sentient if we go beyond
duality the intellectualism and
reductionism of duality we realize that
the motto of my organization is one
universe one people there&#39;s actually one
being there&#39;s one conscious awareness
shining through you and me and everyone
on the planet but also everyone out by
Andromeda or Alpha Centauri or wherever
so the key the key is to bring in some
of the institutions they like the the
the International Catholic Church you
know that is now reaching out that have
actually now held press conferences at
the Vatican saying that it&#39;s now clear
then we&#39;re going to be discovering the
existence of life elsewhere in the
universe much sooner than anyone have
expected and it&#39;s absolutely essential
for us to begin citizens citizens
horizontally to have this is a very
serious conversation about the
philosophical and theological
implications of our encountering an
extraterrestrial civilization of other
highly intelligent and highly
technologically developed species this
nonhuman so that we can get over this
kind of egocentric thing that we are
even though we&#39;re now disappointed to
discover that we weren&#39;t in the very
center of the universe with Galileo but
what we did is we immediately
constructed another
paradigm of a pyramid with us being at
the apex of all sentient life in the
universe right now we know that isn&#39;t
true and what we have to do is we have
to come to really understand our place
in the universe not as the superior
species of the entire universe but
entitled to a place at the at the table
at the Galactic table so that we can
share what the unique qualities are that
we have the unique experiences that
we&#39;ve had of our poetry and our music
and our in our art and our spiritual
insights etc this is these are
extraordinary gifts that we bring to the
universe with others to share things
that they have this concerned maybe more
in advance of us that we have to be open
to and we have to get we have to get the
boundaries of our institutions religious
institutions or militaries to become
become semi permeable during open them
up to start to take in additional
information to be able to expand and
some of them will have to be dissolved
you know this this type of ardent
militarism in the utilization of
military force to threaten people with
death if if we if we&#39;re not allowed to
get privileged access to there&#39;s their
natural resources that&#39;s got to stop you
know there&#39;s a lot of III Jack Brennan
and I would say that then in reality
these institutions frankly are moribund
and are in the process of let&#39;s call it
creative destruction most of these
institutions are imploding under the
weight of their own corruption when I
tell people it you&#39;re unlikely to be
edified by hanging on to the pillars of
these institution as they crumble that&#39;s
what I would suggest is that we come
together as a people we&#39;re really how
we&#39;re aluminum and it I say all the time
excuse me yes the people will lead the
leaders will follow in other words we
have to create a grand groundswell with
the public and actually that&#39;s what this
documentary is about is reach millions
of people with its information but also
to empower them to go out under the
stars and enjoy this sort of Wonder and
awe and say I can be a person on earth
who is conscious and with whatever
limitations we have on earth at this
time the consciousness the mind the
singularity of consciousness is
universal and is equally within all
things and all beings and when you
realize that then you&#39;re no longer a
puny thing a small thing but that you&#39;re
actually connecting to this greater
whole ending reductionism and
intellectualism and separatism and that
state you can then rise to being a
genuine ambassador from community to
these and truly understand the full
capacity that we have as human beings
which are which are presently being
constricted and constrained to make us
think that were just little cogs in a
wheel that someone else&#39;s vehicle has
run but we are in fact the the lifeblood
of our of our planet and for us to be
able to know this in to reach out they
can&#39;t stop us all right they can&#39;t go
around rounding us up because we&#39;re
sitting out in fields in the night time
reaching up to the Stars and reaching
out to the extraterrestrial civilization
it&#39;s beyond their capacity to get this
under control so what we have to do is
we have to do that this is a this is an
evolution of consciousness this is an
extraordinarily important moment in our
in our human evolution like reaching out
to the stars in this case in this is
what we are it is what we&#39;re about at a
time I went by so fast but yeah I would
