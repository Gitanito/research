As a child, I had an accident at the club while running around the locker room.  I bumped my head against the edge of a locker and passed out.  I came to once as my sisters were dragging me out into the reception area.  I remember the clerk starting to yell at me and then everything went black.  The next thing I remember was the feeling that I was on the outside of my family car, looking in.  I could see the road we were traveling and I looked into the car.  I could see myself in the car, with my head slumped against the window.  I remember that my hair was crushed up against the window and I could see that from the outside.

I never told anyone as a child because I didn't think it really happened.  Years later, I heard of out of body experiences and realized that this is what had happened. I still have the lump on the back of my head! 

Background Information:

Gender:    Female

Date NDE Occurred:    Nov 1972

NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?      No   Accident    'Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening'.

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Positive

The experience included:      Out of body experience

Did you feel separated from your body?    Uncertain

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?      Physically I was unconscious but my spiritual side was very alert.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?      No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?      No

Did you see an unearthly light?      Uncertain   I don't know. I could see clearly although it was night and I could make out fine details.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?      I don't remember.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?      No

Did scenes from your past come back to you?      My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?      No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?      No

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?   Conservative/fundamentalist   Catholic

What is your religion now?      Liberal   between Catholic and Neopagan

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?      Yes     I realized that there is a wider metaphysical world that cannot be ignored.

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?     Yes   Didn't think anyone would believe me.  I thought that it was a dream and didn't know why I had such a vivid memory and picture in my head.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      Uncertain     I was too young to know my capabilities.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?       The worst is that it was very painful. I had a concussion.  The best part was later in life when I realized that it did happen.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes    I don't know what they thought.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No
