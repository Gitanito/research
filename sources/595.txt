    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Reincarnation / Re-Incarnation.
 Official Organ of Karma and Reincarnation Legion.
 To Popularize the Teachings of Karma and Reincarnation
 Other titles: Karma and Reincarnation
 1914—1925?  Monthly
 Chicago, IL.  Editor: Weller Van Hook and Conrad Shuddemagen (C. L. B. Shudeman).
 Corporate author:  Karma and Reincarnation League/Legion
 1/1, January 1914-1925(?).  Fifty cents a year, 32 pp.

  The journal's prospectus said that its purpose was "to place before the reader the fact of man's recurring life in physical bodies and the law of Karma, which necessitates that return. It makes a great effort to maintain accuracy, simplicity and directness of expression. A part of the magazine is devoted to the interests of those who are pursuing the more accurate study of the laws of spiritual evolution."   The journal featured articles by Van Hook and Shuddemagen on various doctrinal intricacies of reincarnation, and reports on the doings of their Karma and Reincarnation League/Legion.  Van Hook (1862-1933), a prominent Chicago surgeon, was the General Secretary of the American Section of the Theosophical Society when he started the League, in 1907, and this journal became its official organ when it was started in 1914.  He is notable because of his inflexible support of C.W. Leadbeater in the various scandals of the first decade of the century and for his belief (shared by Besant and Leadbeater) that his son, Hubert, was to be the vessel for the coming of Lord Maitreya -- a belief shattered by the appearance of Krishnamurti.  (Hubert later was one of those who claimed to have been abused by Leadbeater as a boy.)  Noted in William C. Hartmann's Who’s Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual Realms (1925).
