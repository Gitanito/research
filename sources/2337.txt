SINCE this work was projected, and in great part executed,
several others on similar subjects have issued from the press.
The various reasons, personal and professional, which have
delayed the publication of the present volume until now, it is
quite unnecessary to obtrude upon the reader. Suffice it to
observe that that delay was felt to be unavoidable, and, though
greatly regretted by the writers at the time, has been attended
with, at least, one advantage, that of enabling them to include
in their work full notices of the modifications in the law which
recent judicial decisions have effected, and some account of
the alterations in the practice of Parliament in relation to
Railway Bills introduced by the new Standing Orders of the
two Houses,—although the changes in the latter are so frequent
as to require the constant vigilance of the parliamentary agent
to ensure regularity and accuracy in conducting a bill through
its several stages. In now submitting to the public the result
of their labours, the writers are sensible that in their treatment
of topics on which the law is so unsettled, and of proceedings
in which the practice is so various, they have had difficulties to
contend with which it would be absurd to suppose, and arro
gant to affirm, that they had successfully surmounted. During
a considerable portion of the period occupied in the composi
tion of this volume, the legal profession has been in a state of
perplexity and doubt, and society in a condition of anxiety and
J
vi PREFACE.
alarm, in reference to the rights and liabilities springing from
the novel and peculiar relations introduced among men by rail
way speculation. The drift of judicial decision appeared to
fluctuate, and the application of the admitted principles of law
seemed hazardous, amid the doubts engendered, and the uncer
tainty felt in regard to the nature and extent of the obligations
incurred, and the rights acquired, in respect of railway property,
in the several stages of a company's existence. The principles
on which these questions are to be solved, the writers have
aimed to explain as clearly and correctly as the inherent diffi
culties and adventitious perplexities of the subject admitted;
and they entertain a hope that the doctrines propounded will
be found abundantly justified both by the decisions cited in
their support, and by a legitimate application to the several
cases of those rules of law which govern the contracts, and
determine the rights and liabilities of parties in relation to the
more ordinary transactions of mankind. Some indulgence may,
perhaps, fairly be claimed, and will, doubtless, be readily con
ceded, should there be found any errors or omissions in the
discussion of topics so new and so numerous as those which are
embraced within the scope of this treatise. The writers have
spared no pains to be at once full and accurate in their treat
ment of the several branches of their subject. At the same
time they have been anxious not to trespass beyond the limits
of their plan into the regions of general law, pleading and
evidence; and they have felt it difficult at times to effect a just
compromise between too general a treatise on the principles of
law in respect to the rights and remedies of contracting parties;
the mutual claims and obligations of partners; the powers and
disabilities of corporations, and the like; and too restricted a view
of the doctrines and decisions directly affecting the engagements
and relations of Railway Companies.
It will be observed by the reader that some topics have fallen
minder consideration more than once in the several portions of
PREFACE. . - vii
the work, and legal doctrines been repeated in different con
nexions; the authors being willing rather to run the risk of
being blamed for repetition, than incur censure for negligence
and oversight in the discussion of their subject. Thus, under
the division of remedies, frequent references to the nature and
limits of the rights before expounded were quite unavoidable; and
in discoursing of the duties and responsibilities springing from
certain established relations, the powers and claims incident
to those relations could not be overlooked, although they had
been more formally and minutely treated in another part of
the volume. If perspicuity and comprehensiveness have hereby
been secured, the writers will submit the more cheerfully to
critical rebuke for occasional redundancy.
With a view to the direct and practical usefulness of the
work, (the great object throughout) an elaborate digested Index
has been appended, whereby it is hoped every topic discussed
may be readily found, under several different titles; so that
the student and practitioner may be able in a moment to
avail himself of any assistance which the treatise may be cal
culated to afford him in the prosecution of his researches, and
the dispatch of his business. With the same view, and in
accordance with a wholesome modern practice, the cases cited
are arranged in the table under the names both of the plain
tiffs and the defendants.
The Appendix, in addition to an Abstract of the Statutes re
lating to railways, contains a number of forms of public and
private notices, warrants, orders, appointments, agreements,
awards, and the like, adapted to the various exigencies of a
Railway Company, and of those who either would negotiate and
contract with such a body, or are liable to be affected by its
proceedings; and it is hoped that they will be found service
able, as precedents capable of being modified to suit the multi
form demands of actual practice.
The Addenda, at the commencement of the volume, include
viii TREEACE.
all the recent cases on the subject of the treatise which have
appeared in the reports up to the time of publication.
These are all the explanations which it seems necessary to
give of the work now submitted, with great diffidence, to the
candour and indulgence of the profession; and the authors
only detain the reader a moment longer to acknowledge
the assistance they have derived from the learned authors who
have preceded them in their labours, and to the merits of whose
productions both the profession and the public have borne a
testimony, not indeed more sincere, but far more satisfactory
than the eulogies, however earnest, of their fellow-labourers in
the same arduous field could possibly furnish. The references
in the various notes scattered through the following pages will
indicate the nature and extent of the obligations which the
writers have incurred in such quarters.

So much of 7 & 8 Wic. c. 110, sec. 4, as requires the return
to the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, of a
copy of every prospectus, hand bill, &c., is now repealed by
10 & 11 Vic. c. 78, sec. 4: and certain other particulars in
addition to those not repealed, are required by section 5 to be
returned, namely:
First—The amount ofthe proposed capital.
Secondly—The amount and number of shares into which it
is to be divided.
Page 30-line 9.
Thus the committee of a company formed for constructing a
railway from one place to another certain place, could not, on
their capital turning out to be insufficient to carry out their
own scheme, appropriate the funds in hand in furtherance of
another scheme; in such case, all expenses incurred would
fall on the members of the committee, and could not be de
ducted from the deposits of the shareholders, Gilbert v. Cooper,
4 R. C. 397.
Page 48—note (b).
Such a plea has been decided to be bad, consequently if the
defendant is not able to comply with the provisions of 3 & 4
W. 4, c. 42, sec. 8, either because one of those who con
tracted along with him is not resident within the jurisdiction,
or because he is unable to verify his residence, the defendant
is deprived of his plea in abatement altogether.

XX ADDENDA.
Page 48–line 17.
So where separate actions are brought against several joint
contractors for the same cause of action, the court upon pay
ment of the debt and costs in one action will stay the proceed
ings in the others without costs, Newton v. Blunt, C. P. 121, 16
L. J., N. S.; and if separate actions have been brought
against several joint contractors, and one of such joint con
tractors pleads payment of money into court, the court will on
the application of the other party sued, allow him to plead
payment into court without actually paying in the money.
Rendel and another v. Malleson, 16 L. J. N. S., Ex. 168.
Page 51—line 23.
" The doctrine laid down as above has been confirmed by the case
ofWoolmer v. Toby, 16 L. J., Q. B. 225; in which case a pro
jectedrailway companyissued prospectusescontaining the names
of provisional directors, and directing applications for shares to
be made according to a form annexed, to the provisional com
mittee of management of the company; and an application was
accordingly made by the defendant on the 13th of October, in
the prescribed form, and a letter of allotment was sent to him
on the 15th of December, announcing that the committee had
allotted him certain shares. At the foot of this letter was the
form of a banker's receipt, which purported to be given “on
account of the provisional committee.” It also appeared by
resolutions that there was a provisional committee, and also a
part thereof formed into a committee of management, by whom
the business of the formation of the company was conducted.
And between the time of application and the allotment to the
defendant, some of the members of the provisional committee
had withdrawn from that body, and others had been added.
Still, it was held that the contracts to take shares and pay the
deposit, was made with the provisional committee, and not with
the committee of management. -

The doctrines laid down in the preceding remarks have
been overruled by the decision of Wollans v. Fletcher, l L. J.,
Ex. 173, and it would now appear that unless the letter of
ADDENDA. xxi
allotment is a mere acceptance of the terms stated in the letter
of application, it does not amount to an agreementbetween the
allottee and the provisional committee.
Page 56—note (b).
But a letter of allotment that is not a simple acceptance of
the terms stated in the letter of application does not amount
to an agreement, and therefore does not require an agreement
stamp.

In any suit, however, against the directors of a company by
some of the shareholders on behalf of themselves and others,
care must be taken not to join as plaintiff a party who has
assigned his shares: as such party could neither have an in
terest in the winding up of the concern and division of the
surplus; nor could he ask relief on the ground of a right to
be indemnified from liabilities; nor could he adequately repre
sent the beneficial interest of the assignee.

Nor will the fact that the line of railway, as sanctioned by
Parliament, is not identical with the one for which he sub
scribed, exonerate him from his liability, provided it is essen

Pott v. Flather, 16 L. J. N. S. 366, Q. B.
Page 166.
The 6th Geo. IV. c. 123. is repealed by the 10 & 11 Vic.
c. 69, except as to costs incurred in the then, or any preceding
session of Parliament. By the law, as it at present stands, no
parliamentary agent, attorney or solicitor, nor any person
claiming through them, can commence an action for any
charges in respect of any proceedings in the House of Com
mons, or in respect of any proceedings relating to standing
orders, either in carrying through or opposing a bill, until the
expiration of one calendar month after he has delivered a
signed bill to the party sought to be charged. There is one
exception to the above general rule, which is, that if a judge of
the superior courts is satisfied that the party chargeable is
about to quit the kingdom, such judge may authorise an action
to be commenced forthwith. The Speaker has, as before, the
power of appointing a taxing officer, (a) and also the power of
making a list of charges to be allowed in taxation; (b) and the
taxing officer is now entitled to examine witnesses on oath,
and to receive affidavits sworn before him, or any master extra
ordinary in Chancery; (c) and he may also call for books and
papers. (d)
The costs of taxation, it would appear, are now in the dis
cretion of the taxing officer, and he may award them in such
proportion as he thinks fit. (e)
Either the party chargeable, or the attorney or agent send
ing in the bill, may make application for the taxation thereof;
and if either party, after having had due notice of the day
(a) Sec. 3. (b) Sec. 4. (c) Sec. 5.
(d) Sec. 6. (e) Sec. 7.
A1DDEN DA. xxiii
appointed for taxation, neglect to attend, the taxing officer
may proceed to tax and settle the bill ex parte. If pending
the taxation of a bill proceedings be taken for the recovery
thereof, the judge, or court, before whom the same are
brought, shall stay all proceedings until the amount of the
bill has been certified by the Speaker. The party chargeable,
however, is not entitled to make an application for the taxa
tion of a bill after a verdict shall have been obtained, or a
writ of inquiry executed in an action for the recovery of the
demand, nor after the expiration of six months after the de
livery of a signed bill; unless the Speaker, on receiving a report
of the special circumstances, think fit to order the bill to be
taxed. (a)
The taxing officer, if required by either party, must report
his taxation to the Speaker; and either party may, within
twenty-one days after the report shall have been made, deposit
in the office of the taxing officer a memorial addressed to the
Speaker, complaining of the report, or any portion of it; and
the Speaker may refer the report, or any subsequent one, to
the taxing officer to review his taxation.
If no memorial to review taxation has been presented, or
(where such memorial has been presented) after the matters
complained of shall have been disposed of the Speaker, upon
application of either party, shall deliver a certificate of the
amount so ascertained, and such certificate shall be conclusive
as to the amount of costs and charges in all proceedings, either
in law or equity. And unless the defendant has pleaded that
he is not liable to the payment of such costs or charges, the
certificate shall have the effect of a warrant of attorney, and
the court, or judge of the court, in which the action shall have
been commenced, shall order judgment to be entered up for
the sum specified in the certificate, as if the (b) defendant had
in any such action signed a warrant to confess judgment.
Page 228—line 14.
The party petitioning for the investment of purchase money
paid into court, and the payment of dividends, must make an
affidavit that he believes his title to be good; and the affidavit
to that effect will not be dispensed with, although the petitioner

North British Railway Company, v. Tod, 4 R. C. 449.
Page 471—line 30.
A question of importance arises here as to what portions of
the property of a railway company are liable to be seized under
a fieri facias. Obviously, all chattels belonging to them, such
as carriages, engines, trucks, and the like, may be taken under
an execution. It is, however, doubtful whether the rails could
be removed; and it would seem that, inasmuch as the rails
would pass to the heir, and not go to the executor, they could
not be seized by a creditor of the company, under a writ. On
grounds of public policy, too, they would appear to be exempt.
Fisher v. Dixon, 12 Clarke and Finelly. See post. pp.
509, 510.
Page 479 last line but one.
We have already seen (a) that a party contracting to sell
shares need not be in possession of them at the time of the
contract, but that it will be sufficient if he put himself into a
condition to fulfil his contract at the period appointed. And
although the vendor should fail through some default of the
other contracting party to put himself actually into such a
condition (as by a neglect to pay a call due, which must be
paid under 8 Vic. c. 16, before a valid transfer can be effected),
yet he will not thereby be precluded from recovering damages
against the purchaser. Thus where the defendants bought of
the plaintiffs on the 15th of October a hundred railway shares
to be paid for on the 31st of October, and on the 14th a call
(a) Supra, p. 475.
ADDEN DA, XXV
had been made on the shares; on the lst of November the
vendors (who according to the custom of the share market were
to prepare the transfer deed) applied to the purchasers for a
name to be inserted therein, and the latter refused, and subse
quently, on a tender of the shares being made, declined to
accept them, and an action was brought on the contract by the
vendors, the plaintiffs were held entitled to a verdict on a plea
that they were not ready and willing to transfer the shares, as,
when they asked for a name and were refused, they were in a
condition by paying the calls to make a valid transfer.

So though the line of railway sanctioned by parliament be
not identical with the one for which he subscribed, yet if it be

It has been held, however, that in an action against a rail

than they were by law entitled to take, the company was en
titled to notice of action, as the action must be deemed to be
one for something done in pursuance of their act of incorpora

RELATING TO
RAILWAY COMPANIES.
-o
INTRODUCTORY.
AT common law, any number of persons joining together Associations at
and forming a company or association for the purpose of " law.
carrying out any project by means of combined capital,
stood exactly in the same relative situation, both among
themselves and in respect of third parties, as the members
of any other partnership composed of a limited number of
individuals. And although the partners could, by their
deed of settlement, regulate the mode of government
among themselves, still, such arrangements could not
avail in any way to limit their responsibility to third par
ties. On the one hand, a person entering into any such
company, not incorporated, however small the amount of
his interest, would be individually liable, in solido (a), to
third parties, on all matters arising during the period of
his continuing a member; while, on the other, he would
be entitled only to those remedies against his co-partners,
whether in law or equity, which would be available in ordi
nary partnerships. However beneficial to the interests of a statutory re
trading country the combination of capital subscribed by :
a number of persons may be, as furnishing means for the
execution of works entirely beyond the reach of a partner

2 RAILWAY COMPANIES.
The Bubble
Act.
ship composed of a few individuals, there is no doubt that
the formation of companies on the joint stock principle
opened the door to innumerable impositions on the public,
who, either from ignorance or from an inordinate desire of
gain, rushed into numerous schemes fraudulently concocted
and of the most hope'ess character.
To such an extent was this the case, that as early as the
reign of George the First the establishment of such com
panies was felt to be a public evil so serious, that a statute
was passed (a) (known as the Bubble Act) containing several
restrictions on their formation, and imposing heavy penal
ties on the parties originating them.
Thus, sec. 18 of that statute declares that any company
acting or presuming to act as a corporate body, or raising
transferable stock, or attempting to transfer such stock,
without legal authority, either by act of parliament or
charter, was to be deemed null and void. The following
section enacts that such undertakings shall be deemed
public nuisances, and their promoters liable to be indicted.
But however laudable the intention of the legislature in
passing this act, the restrictions contained in it were found
to be incompatible with the freedom which is essential to
the interests of commerce; and hence it soon became a
dead letter in the statute-book. And although in one
case it was attempted to lay an information under this
statute against a party for establishing a company with
transferable shares, yet the rule was refused; the court
evidently leaning to the defendant, and deciding that the
relator should be left to avail himself of the common law
remedy by indictment, or that the Attorney-General
should proceed, ex officio, if he should deem it advisable
for the protection of the public (b). In the other cases that
came before the courts on the construction of the above
statute, the legality of the association in question was not

tested (as in the words of the act itself) by the issuing of
transferable shares, but by the issuing shares transferable
without restriction (a). From the decisions in the above
cases, it was evident that the bias of the court was against
the act; and serious doubts being engendered as to the
policy of it, it was subsequently repealed by the 6 Geo. 4,
c. 91, which, putting an end to the statutory penalties
previously imposed, declared that all companies within the
6 Geo. 1, c. 18, were in future “to be dealt with and ad
judged upon in like manner as might have been done at
common law.” Hence the formation of a joint stock com
pany having transferable shares is not illegal, unless the
purposes for which it was formed are likely to be injurious
to the public (b). Since that time various statutes have
been passed regulating joint stock companies formed for
carrying on particular branches of trade, as well in regard
to their original construction and their internal manage
ment, as to the liabilities of the subscribers in such com
panies to third parties, and the mode of suing and being
sued.
Whenever a company formed upon the joint stock prin
ciple for purposes not included in those branches of trade
for the regulation of which special statutes had been
passed, was desirous of limiting the responsibility of its
members to the extent of the sum subscribed by each
individual, it was usual to obtain an act of incorporation.
Such act in general prescribed the mode of suing and
being sued in the name of the secretary or some other
public officer of the company specially named therein,
and limited the responsibility of the members to the
amount of their respective subscriptions; and all parties
contracting with such incorporated body were presumed
to contract with the company and upon the credit of its
funds, and not on the credit of each individual member.

But as the expense of obtaining an act of incorporation
was very great, a statute (7 Will. 4 & 1 Vic. c. 73) was
passed, whereby the crown was empowered by letters
patent to grant to any number of persons associated
together for trading purposes, any privileges which,
according to the rules of the common law, it would be
competent to the crown to grant by any charter of incor
poration.
It is an essential preliminary to a company obtaining
such letters patent that a deed of partnership should be
signed by every member thereof, binding himself, his
heirs, executors, and administrators to pay the amount of
his subscription.
It should be observed that none of the above statutes in
any way applied to companies requiring the authority of
parliament for the execution of their works, or the accom
plishment of their purposes: but a late act (the 7 & 8
Vict, cap. 110) intitled “An Act for the Registration,
Incorporation, and Regulation of Joint Stock Companies,”
is of more extensive application, and includes all com
panies formed after the first day of November 1844, (a)

insurance companies and similar institutions. All part

CHAPTER I.
PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS RENDERED NECESSARY BY
7 & 8 VICT., c. 110.
IN the foregoing introductory remarks we have confined
our attention to the formation of such Joint Stock Com
panies as did not require a compulsory power over the
rights and properties of others, to enable them to carry
on their operations and effect their objects; we shall in
future direct our observations to those companies which
cannot accomplish their purposes without interfering with
the private rights of third parties, and which cannot,
therefore, carry out their undertakings without the aid of
such extraordinary powers (unknown at common law) as
are only to be obtained by a special act of the legislature.
Although the statute 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, excepts out of its
operation (as we have already seen) companies for execut
ing any work which cannot be carried into execution
without the authority of Parliament, (unless where other
wise specially provided) still so many of the sections are
expressly made to apply to such companies during their
formation and previous to their obtaining an act of incor
poration, that we must, at all events, during the stages of
provisional registration, include railway companies, as
entirely within the meaning and operation of that act.
Where, however, a railway company was incorporated
by an act before the first of November, 1844; but sub
sequently to that day the company resolved to make an

extension line, and, on the thirtieth of July, 1845, obtained
an act for that purpose, it was held that the latter under
taking was not a partnership, the formation of which was
commenced after the first of November, 1844, and that
the company was not therefore within the operation of
the Joint Stock Companies Act. (a)
In the present book we propose to show how Railway
Companies formed for the purpose of executing works
that cannot be carried into execution without the aid of
the legislature, are regulated and controlled by the above
statute, in their original formation and first announce
ment to the public, in conduct and management previous
to incorporation, and in respect of the rights, powers,
duties, and liabilities of promoters, directors, and share
holders, both among themselves and to third parties.
SEC. I.—PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION, AND PRELIMINARY
PROCEEDINGS.
AFTER the projectors or promoters have in their own minds
matured a scheme, whether for constructing a railway or
other work under the authority of Parliament, or for any
other purpose requiring a larger capital than they them
selves can command, the first step generally taken is to
advertise the project, and invite the public to subscribe
their names, and contribute funds towards the formation
of a company for carrying it out. But since the passing (a) Provisional
ofthe Joint Stock Companies Act, which came into opera-"
tion on the first of November, 1844, before being per
mitted to announce such scheme publicly whether by
advertisement, hand bill, or prospectus, the promoters (b)
are required to register certain particulars in an office s.4

called the registry office for Joint Stock Companies, and
to obtain a certificate of provisional registration.
The following are the particulars required to be given
to the registrar. (a)
1st. The Name of the intended Company.
2nd. The Purpose of the Company.
3rd. The Name of the Promoters with their respective
occupations, places of Business, (if any) and
places of residence.
Upon a return being made of these three particulars,
signed by one or more of such promoters on behalf of him
self and the others, and the payment of a fee of 5l.,
(s. 21), the promoters will be entitled to a certificate of
Provisional Registration. This certificate is of force only
for twelve calendar months from the date thereof, (s. 23),
at the expiration of which time, if the company have neither
been incorporated by Act of Parliament nor have been
completely registered, a renewed certificate of Provisional
Registration must be obtained, for which a fee of 21, is to
be paid. This renewed certificate, like the original, lasts
only one year. (b)
Having obtained such certificate of Provisional Regis
tration, the promoters are then at liberty to announce pub
licly, either by advertisement, handbill, or otherwise, the
title, objects, and purposes of the intended company, but
coupled with the words “registered provisionally,” to open
subscription lists, to allot shares, and receive deposits by
way of earnest thereon, at a rate not exceeding the sum of
10s. for every 100l. on the amount of every share in the
capital of the intended company; and, in the case of rail
way companies, such further sum as may be required by

attendance is given daily (Sundays and Holydays excepted), from 10 till 4

pany who, having failed in one session of Parliament, propose to renew their
application in another.
CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY.
the standing orders of either House of Parliament, (a) and
to do such other acts as may be necessary for obtaining
their Act of Parliament. The amount of deposit at pre
sent required by the standing orders of both Houses, is
one-tenth part of the capital subscribed.
The Joint Stock Act does not render the existence of any
company that is not provisionally registered before being
publicly announced illegal, so as to vitiate all proceedings
taken by such unregistered company, but imposes a penalty
of 25l. (s.24) upon the promoters, and also upon persons
employedby them,for either taking money by way of deposit,
or for issuing scrip, or any instrument denoting a claim to
any share in the proposed company; or for advertising the
existence or proposed formation of such company, previous
to its having been provisionally registered. Any person
may sue for and recover this penalty by action of debt.
After the company has been provisionally registered,
the promoters should appoint a solicitor (s. 6) whose
duty it will be to make the requisite returns and manage
the legal business of the company. After such appoint
ment, most, if not all, of the penalties imposed upon the
promoters for neglecting to comply with the provisions of
the Act, will fall upon the solicitor. The appointment
must be in writing, and signed by one or more of the pro
moters. The acceptance of the appointment must also be
in writing, and signed by the solicitor appointed; and
duplicates both of the appointment and the acceptance
must be lodged with the registrar of Joint Stock Companies.
The solicitor being thus appointed, and having thus ac
cepted the appointment, becomes to all intents and pur
poses the solicitor of the intended company, and remains
liable to the penalties of neglect or default in the discharge
of his duties until his death, or until the appointment has
been revoked, or he himself has resigned. Neither the
revocation of such appointment by the promoters, nor the

resignation by the solicitor is complete, until a duplicate
either of the written resignation or revocation, as the case
may be, has in like manner been deposited with the regis
trar; and until the prescribed formalities shall have been
duly observed, the attorney will be liable as such for the
discharge of every duty appertaining to the situation, and
will remain exposed to all the consequences of neglect.
Hence the proper appointment of the attorney is one of
the most important steps in the preliminary movements of
a company, for immediately on the registration of the ap
pointment by the promoters, and of the acceptance by the
attorney, the promoters are relieved from duties and liabi
lities of the most serious character, and from the risk of
incurring penalties both for sins of omission and commis
sion, from which non-professional persons are ordinarily
found incompetent to protect themselves. If the returns
required by the above act be not duly made, the promoters,
before the appointment of a solicitor and the solicitor after
wards (ss. 5, 6) are liable to forfeit a sum of 20l., at almost
every step of their progress. In addition to these penal
ties imposed on the solicitor for non-compliance with the
act, he is also liable either to be suspended from practice
for any time to be appointed by the Court to which he be
longs, or to be struck off the rolls, if it appear to such
Court that he fraudulently omitted to make any of the re
quired returns.
After the original promoters have obtained their certifi
cate of provisional registration, they generally associate
with themselves other persons as provisional directors.
The term “directors” is usually (although not correctly)
applied to any person whose name is included in the pro
visional committee. It should rather be reserved for the
members of the managing committee, after incorporation
or complete registration; since the definition of the word
“directors,” given by the statute (s.3), is, “The persons
having the direction, conduct, management, or superin
tendance of the affairs of a company;” and in the sen
CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 1 |
tence immediately following it is declared, that the term
“promoter” shall apply to “every person, acting by what
ever name, in the forming or establishing of a company at
any period prior to the company obtaining a certificate of
complete registration.” Taking the two definitions toge
ther, and referring to the 16th section, which, with regard
to the authentication of returns, provides that, previous to
complete registration, the promoters of the company, or
their solicitor, shall make all the returns required by the
act; and (ss. 10, 11), after such company shall have ob
tained a certificate of complete registration, the directors
shall make or cause to be made every such return; it is
quite clear that the term “director” is improperly used in
the provisional stages of the company, and that all parties
having the direction and management previous to complete
registration or incorporation, although usually called pro
visional directors or managing committee-men, do not fall
within the definition given above, and should be designated
“promoters.”
Two sections of the Joint Stock Act, the 28th and the
4th, seem to have been designed to prevent any person
from acting either as a promoter of a company before com
plete registration, or as a director afterwards, without the
possession of a certain specified qualification. In the 28th
section, it is enacted that it shall not be lawful to appoint
any person to act as a director, whether honorary or other
wise, or to hold the office of patron, or president, or any
other office of like description, unless at the time of such
appointment, or of such his acting, he hold in his own
right at least one share in the capital of the company. The
section then proceeds to inflict a penalty, first, on the
party acting without such qualification; secondly, on the
person announcing the name of such unqualified individual
as a director, in the following words, “that if, without
having such share, any person be, or become, or act as
director, patron, or president of such company, or in any
office of such or the like nature, then he shall forfeit for

every such offence a sum not exceeding 20l.; and that if
any person be announced or held out as a director, patron,
or president, or as holding any office of such description,
without having so consented, then each director of such
company, knowingly concurring in such representation,
shall forfeit the sum of 20l.” For obvious reasons, this
section cannot be held to apply to railway companies,
first, because they are not specially alluded to and included'
in the enactment; and, secondly, because the provision is
made in regard of a company completely registered; and
a railway company, if completely registered (which is rarely
the case), can be so but for the very short interval between
the obtaining of a certificate thereof, and the procuring of
the act of incorporation; because, as soon as incorporated
by Act of Parliament, the company is exempted entirely
from all the provisions of the statute in question.
Let us now inquire whether the 4th section of the act is
so framed as to secure the object proposed,
By that section the promoters are required, when and
as they shall be ascertained and decided on, to register the
names of all the members of the committee, or other body
acting in the formation of the company, with their respec
tive occupations, places of business, and of residence, toge
ther with the written consent of each of such promoters, to
become such ; and a written agreement on the part of each
promoter, entered into with some one or more persons as
trustees for the said company, to take one or more shares
in the proposed undertaking, which must be signed by the
member whose agreement it purports to be. The next
section provides that, should the registration above required
be delayed for a period of one month after the particulars
have been ascertained or determined, any promoter, or the
solicitor, if duly appointed, will be liable to a penalty of
20l., to be recovered, in the absence of any specific re
medy, in the mode pointed out by the 69, 70, and follow
ing sections.
The only cffect of these two sections, taken together, is
CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 13
to make the promoters of the company (or their solicitor)
liable to the penalty imposed, when they shall have failed
to register the written consent of a member of the com
mittee to take one or more shares in the proposed com
pany for one month after such consent shall “have been
ascertained or determined.” If, therefore, there has never
been any such consent, it would seem that the predicament
contemplated in the 5th section has never arisen, and the
penalty cannot be incurred. Even if it should be held
that, under the circumstances supposed, the parties would
be liable under that clause, still there is nothing in the
enactments under consideration making it unlawful for a
person who has never agreed to take any shares to act as
a promoter in the formation of the company. The object
of the sections we have quoted is, palpably, to make a
qualification mccessary for a promoter; but the terms em
ployed seem inadequate for the accomplishment of that
object.
The promoters, having duly registered their scheme,
associated other persons with themselves as provisional
committee men, and appointed a solicitor to act on their
behalf, are in a position to issue their prospectus, and to
invite the public to subscribe to their undertaking. The
prospectus generally contains the title or name of the
intended railway, with the words “registered provisionally.”

which it is to be divided.
The deposit to be paid on each share.

with the public. Considerable care is required in drawing
up the prospectus, as, previous to the execution of the
deeds, it is considered as setting forth the terms of the
contract between the promoters and the subscribers.
Hence the amount of capital, the number of shares, and
the authority of the promoters (in case, through the want
of public support, or the refusal of the legislature to sanc
tion the project, the act of incorporation should not be
obtained) to expend the sum deposited, or some definite
proportion thereof, in the payment of the expenses incurred,
should be expressly mentioned.
Although the 4th section of the Joint Stock Act states
Registry of that a copy of every hand bill, prospectus, or circular,
must be registered previous to publication, no penalty is
imposed (provided the company has been provisionally
registered) for issuing them previous to such registration,
but if the registration of such copy be delayed for a month
after the time ofpublication, the 5th section makes the pro
moters, or the solicitor, as the case may be, liable to a
penalty of 20l. This penalty, as there is no particular
mode of recovering it prescribed, is recoverable under the
69th section by any person who shall proceed for the same
before two justices of the peace having jurisdiction either
where the offender resides, or where the offence was com
mitted.

As in the case of ordinary contracts, an offer, so long as
it is unaccepted, may be withdrawn by the party making
it (a), so an application for shares is not sufficient of itself
to complete the agreement between the parties, so as to
make it compulsory upon a party applying, to take them
up, and pay the deposit thereon, but the applicant will be
at liberty to withdraw his application at any time previous
to an allotment being made to him. As to the effect of
the application coupled with the allotment, see post (b).
On the receipt of the letters of application, it is usual
to number them in the order in which they arrive, and
also to enter them in iike manner in a book called the
Numerical Register. Great care ought to be taken of the
letters of application, for two reasons: First, as being
evidence of a contract to take the shares; and secondly,

because they may probably be called for in parliament,
and the non-production of them might throw discredit on
the parties petitioning the legislature for their bill.
It would seem that any person applying for shares
under a false name is liable to criminal prosecution, under
the statutes passed against forgery; and whether the name
used be that of an utterly fictitious person who never
existed, or of a person actually existing, is wholly imma
terial; it is as much a forgery in the one case as in
the other, (a) provided the fictitious name be assumed
for the purposes of fraud in the particular instance in
question. (b) Indeed it is now a settled rule, that the
counterfeiting any writing with a fraudulent intent,
whereby another would be prejudiced, is forgery at
common law. (c)
The promoters having received a sufficient number of
applications for shares in the proposed undertaking, it is
their duty to select from among the applicants the most
eligible to whom they shall allot.
Care should be taken in the allotment of shares, neither
to allot too many nor too few. If the directors allot too
many they may be liable at the suit of any holder of scrip
certificates, for refusing to register him as a shareholder
after they obtain their act of incorporation; (d) on the
other hand if, having a sufficient number of applicants,
they allot too few, they may be held personally liable for
all expenses incurred, should they be unable in consequence
of such mismanagement to proceed in their application to
Parliament; and a bill in equity might be filed against
them by the shareholders, praying that they may be

decreed to make good all losses sustained by their mis
conduct. (a)
To prevent fraud and secure a number of responsible
subscribers, rigid enquiries ought to be made not merely
as to the genuineness of the signature and identity of the
party applying, but also as to his ability to take up his
shares and pay the deposit and the calls when they shall
become due. (b)
The mischievous consequences of fraudulent applications
for shares are not corrected by the punishment of the par
ties offending; for the promoters, by the insertion of the
names of such fictitious applicants in their parliamentary
contract, take an incomplete scheme into parliament, and
are liable to be rejected on the ground either of not having
a sufficient number of genuine signatures to their deeds,
as required by the standing orders, or of bringing before
the House a contract tainted with fraud. And it is highly
probable, that although there might be genuine signatures
to such an amount of subscriptions as should equal three
fourths of the estimated cost of the works, yet still the
bill would be thrown out, unless it was shown that due
diligence had been used in making the necessary enquiries
as to the identity of the parties applying; and the peti
tioners might have their application refused, as being par
ties implicated in the guilt of attempting a fraud on the
legislature and the public, by inserting as subscribers to
their scheme the names of men utterly unable to meet the
engagements for which they have made themselves
responsible in the parliamentary contract. Hence
the promoters must use great diligence in assuring
themselves both of the genuineness of the application,

Beav., 323.
(b) A remarkable instance of the necessity of such precaution is furnished
by the position in which the London and York Railway Company were placed
in the session of 1845, by the petition for a scrutiny of the names appended to
the subscription contracts.

and of the integrity and pecuniary ability of the ap
plicants.
A letter of allotment is a written notice to an applicant
for shares, informing him that the committee of manage
ment have allotted him a certain number, and requiring
him to pay the deposit thereon, and sign the usual deeds
on or before a certain day. On the receipt of this notice,
if it be a simple intimation of compliance with the request
of the applicant not introducing any conditions (a) at all
varying the form of application hereinbefore given, there
can be no doubt that the application for shares and agree
ment to pay the deposit and sign the usual deeds when
required, coupled with the letter of allotment sent by the
provisional committee, renders the contract between the
parties complete; and that the provisional committee have
sufficient ground either for filing a bill in equity to com
pel a specific performance of the agreement (b), or for
bringing an action at common law for the breach of the
contract to pay the deposit; in which action they may also
recover, in the shape of damages, any loss sustained by the
company through the allottee's non-fulfilment of his en
gagements.
On the party producing the letter of allotment, and
paying the deposit upon the shares allotted to him to one
of the bankers named in such letter, he will receive in ex
change for his letter of allotment a banker's receipt. The
banker's receipt is a document signed by the banker, ac
knowledging that he has received on account of the per
sons named therein the amount of deposit mentioned in
the letter of allotment.
Neither letters of allotment nor the receipts are trans
ferable, and hence the transferee acquires no rights as
against the company, and therefore cannot claim to exe
cute the deeds in the place of the original allottee.

company on provisional registration, is that of allotting
shares, and incidental to this power is the authority to
distribute them among the applicants in such proportions
as to them may appear right, altogether rejecting some
offers, granting some in part, and others to the full extent
of the demand, according as in their judgment the inte
rests of the company may require. The allotment must,
however, be bond fide not fraudulent, or the provisional
committee will be liable for the consequences of their
fraud, in a suit in equity, at the instance of those allottees
or members who have suffered by reason of their miscon
duct; or, if the schemes should prove abortive, in an
action at law to recover back the amount of deposit paid. (a)
The provisional committee may also, in furtherance of
the objects of the company, make contracts and agree
ments with landowners both as to the mode of intersecting
their lands, and the amount of compensation to be paid
either for the lands or for withdrawing opposition; such
contracts are, of course, conditional, and provided they
are made in good faith they will be binding on the com
pany in the event of the act being obtained. (b) They
may also, if so authorized by the deed of settlement, or

regards amalgamation with rival companies, or as to the
abandonment of any portion of the line, or the making of
additional branches. Should they, however, be desirous
of doing anything beyond the scope of the powers con
ferred on them by their deed of settlement, and beside the
direct purposes for which the company was formed, they
should obtain the express sanction of the shareholders at
a meeting duly convened for that object.
Incidental to the right of doing the several acts
hereinbefore mentioned, it is submitted that the pro
visional committee have authority to pledge the credit of
the company for any and all purposes within the scope
and objects of the association, subject to the restrictions
imposed by the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110; and also the right to
indemnify themselves for all liabilities and expenses
incurred in carrying out the project. For this purpose
they may, in the absence of any agreement to the con
trary, appropriate the deposits of subscribers to the pay
ment of all costs properly incurred. The subscribers’
agreement however usually gives express authority to this
effect. Although the provisional committee are empow
ered immediately on provisional registration to do all the
above mentioned acts, it is advisable before incurring the
heavy expenses attending the full exercise of their powers,
that they should satisfy themselves that there will be a
sufficient number of subscribers to constitute the com
pany, otherwise if the project turn out abortive for want
of adequate public support, they may not be entitled to
appropriate to the liquidation of expenses incurred any
portion of the deposits actually paid. (a)
It would, therefore, be prudent in all cases, before
taking any step which would involve a considerable outlay,
to wait until the deposits have been paid, and the sub

subscription or parliamentary contract, and subscribers’
agreement.
The parliamentary contract is a deed whereby the
several subscribers covenant with certain persons, named
therein as trustees for the proposed company, that they
have subscribed for the sums placed opposite thcir names,
for the purpose of making a railway from a certain place
to another certain place, with discretionary powers to the
persons named as directors to vary and alter both the
termini and intermediate stations, to abandon or defer any
portion of the line, as they may think fit, and to apply ‘o
parliament in the ensuing, or any future session, for an
Act of Incorporation; with a covenant to pay (in case
the act is obtained) the amount subscribed within a certain
time; or, in case the bill is thrown out, to contribute
towards the expenses incurred in proportion to their shares.
It should be oberved that if the trustees, with whom the
subscribers covenant, execute the deed as shareholders,
the instrument will be void. As to the particulars required
by the standing orders of the Houses of Parliament to be
observed in respect of the parliamentary contract, see next
book.
The subscribers’ agreement or deed of settlement is a
contract under seal between the subscribers and certain
parties named therein as trustees for and on behalf of the
intended company, by the terms of which its internal
government previous to incorporation is regulated.
This deed usually contains a covenant on the part of
the several subscribers to pay up the amount of their
subscriptions. It then proceeds further to covenant That
certain persons named therein are to be the directors and
managers of the business and affairs of the company until
the bill is obtained, that each subscriber will abide by
the regulations specified in the deed and by such others
as the directors may make in furtherance of the objects
of the association. Of these the principal are such as

which it may be increased or diminished, the amount of
deposit, and the manner of appropriating it in discharge
of preliminary expenses, and the time and mode of pay
ment of future instalments.
It further provides, that in case any of the subscribers
fail to execute any future deeds which may become
necessary under the standing orders of either house of
parliament, the committee of management may forfeit
their shares; then follow clauses appointing the chairman
and deputy chairman with the mode of voting; clauses
regulating the filling up of vacancies in the direction,
occurring by death, resignation, or misconduct; and the
appointment of sub-committees; clauses giving the
directors power to employ surveyors, clerks and others, to
survey and make plans and estimates for surveys and
execution of works, and to make bargains with land
owners and others as to the purchase of land in case
the bill should pass. In this deed large discretionary
powers are given to the managing body to be exercised
for the promotion of the general objects of the company,
although it has not been usual in the generality of sub
scribers’ agreements to make any provision for the disso
lution of the intended company in case any number of
shareholders less than the whole should be desirous of
breaking up the company, or in case a rival line should
have obtained an act of incorporation, it is advisable that
such a provision should be inserted in all subscribers’
agreements, as without it any one dissentient shareholder
would be enabled to prevent the dissolution of a company,
although it might have either become impracticable or
inexpedient to carry it out, for it cannot be inferred from
the general construction of the subscribers’ agreement
that the majority, or any definite number, shall have
authority to direct and regulate the affairs of the com
pany;(a) and although by a late act, 9 & 10 Vict, cap. 28,

Railway Companies, provision was made for the dissolu
tion of such companies, it would appear that this act was
applicable only to persons or companies that had entered
into contracts for the making of railways previous to the
passing thereof, and that as far as that act was concerned,
all parties entering into such contracts subsequently were
left in the same position as before.(a) -
Although the provisions of the two instruments called
the parliamentary contract and subscribers’ agreement
may be (and sometimes are) all included in the former,
and the latter be altogether dispensed with, yet it is on
many accounts desirable to have the two separate deeds.
In the first place, the objects of the two are totally differ
ent. The parliamentary contract is prepared and exe
cuted in compliance with standing orders, and relates only
to the subscription itself. The subscribers agreement,
on the other hand, is a document prescribing the terms
on which the parties executing it consent to belong to
the proposed company, and the various regulations of the
society before incorporation. The insertion of such pro
visions (numerous as they must necessarily be for this
purpose) would needlessly encumber the parliamentary
contract, and, from the complex character of the docu
ment, some would almost unavoidably be overlooked and
omitted; whilst if made the subject of a separate deed
they are at once more likely to be remembered, and to
be so framed as to secure the objects proposed.

THE ACT IS OBTAINED.
sEC. I.—Rights and Liabilities of the original Promoters
of a Company, before the formation of a Provisional Com
mittee.
BY the interpretation clause (a) of the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110,
the term “promoter” is made to apply “to every person
acting by whatever name in the forming and establishing
of a company at any period prior to the company obtaining
a certificate of complete registration.” This definition will
include the members both of provisional and managing
committees, as well as the original projectors; but in com
mon parlance the word “promoters” is seldom employed to
designate any persons other than those who originated the
scheme, and in whose names it is provisionally registered.
It is of these persons exclusively that we are now to speak,
and we shall treat of their rights and liabilities as arising
out of their connection with and management of the pro
jected company before the formation of a provisional com
mittee.
Although the statute 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, forbids the
promoters of a scheme to make the same public before it
has been provisionally registered, there is nothing in that
act to preclude them from taking privately all such steps
as they may deem necessary for the developing and com
pleting of their project. Expenses, more or less serious in
amount, may be incurred in these preliminary proceedings,
(a) Section 3.
CHAP. 11.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY.
but most commonly the prudence of the parties concerned
induces them to limit the outlay in this stage to the pay
ment of the fee required for provisional registration, the
promoters being unwilling to incur any serious personal
liability, until the deposits of subscribers shall form a fund
to which they can resort. But where the promoters are
desirous ofrigidly examining and fully maturing the scheme
previous to any public announcement of it, considerable
expense must necessarily be incurred in getting informa
tion, making calculations as to the probable cost of con
struction, procuring returns of traffic, ascertaining the dis
positions of landowners and others on the proposed line,
and in the employment of engineers, surveyors, and other
officers, whose assistance may be necessary for those
purposes.
The question here arises, Who are the parties liable for
these expenses? Should the scheme of the projectors
prove abortive and no company be formed, there can be
no doubt that the persons who gave the orders are the only
parties liable. It is a case of simple contract, on which
there is a direct personal liability. If, however, the project
be adopted by a number of persons, who on its provisional
registration form themselves into a company, under and
subject to the provisions of the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, a ques
tion may arise how far the original projectors transfer the
liability for previous expenses from themselves to the pro
visional or managing committee then formed.
The mere fact of the projectors either associating others
with themselves in the conduct of the scheme, or transfer
ring it over entirely, will not, even in case of an express
agreement to that effect between the projectors and the
incoming parties, or the new provisional committee, relieve
the former from their original liability, nor render their
associates or successors liable to the creditors, unless some
arrangement is made between the creditors, the projectors,
and the incoming provisional committee-men, that the
latter are to be taken and considered as the parties liable.

Whether the registered promoters of a scheme which
they have either entirely transferred to others, or in the
management of which they have associated others with
themselves, acquire any right against the company when
formed (in the absence of express agreement) is a question
of considerable importance. If they have merely asso
ciated others with themselves in the conduct of the com
pany and still take part in its affairs, it would seem that
they will be entitled in equity to be allowed all charges,
losses, and expenditure incurred in the transaction of the
business subsequent to the formation of the partnership,
but cannot claim any compensation, commission, or reward
for their skill, labour, and services while employed in be
half of the intended company. (a)
If, however, previous to associating with, or transferring
the scheme over to, others, they enter into an express
agreement as to the consideration to be paid to them, and
the terms on which they part with the whole, or certain
portions, of their interest therein, they will have a right
in either case to compel the specific performance of
such agreement; and their remedy will be either in
Equity or at Common Law, according to the circumstance
of their being partners or otherwise with the contracting
parties. (b)
It frequently happens that the scheme is registered by
and in the names of parties who are desirous of being ap
pointed to the respective offices of engineer, solicitor, or
secretary of the intended company. In such case, should
the scheme prove abortive, and the registered promoters
have transferred it, without special agreement, either par
tially or entirely to the hands of others, they would be
precluded from enforcing any claim for their work, labour,
and services. Thus, where, (in a recent case) the secretary,
who was also a registered promoter of a scheme which

failed, brought an action against certain members of the
provisional committee to recover compensation for his ser
vices, the Lord Chief Baron directed the plaintiff to be
non-suited, saying, “It appears to me that a promoter
cannot sue any provisional committee-man, or any person
connected with the scheme. The 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, has
limited what the parties may do, and the promoters may
incur certain preliminary expenses, but they cannot sue
any of the directors for any of those expenses.” (a) This
decision seems to be grounded on the fact, that under the
circumstances stated, the relations of partnership subsisted
between the plaintiff and the defendants, as being all asso
ciated together for the promotion of the scheme, although
it did not appear that the plaintiff had taken, or agreed to
take, any shares in the proposed company. If, however,
the Act of Incorporation be obtained, the original pro
moters would be entitled to remuneration under the usual
clauses, appropriating the money received in the first place
to the payment of the expenses incurred in obtaining
the Act. (b)

The scheme having been provisionally registered, and

(a)Their rights
and powers.
Generally.
After the provisional registration of any company, it is
lawful for the provisional committee to assume the name
of the intended company, to issue their prospectus, to
open subscription lists, to allot shares, and receive a
deposit of ten shillings per cent. thereon, and in the case
of companies requiring the authority of Parliament, such
further sum per cent. as may be required by the standing
orders of either House of Parliament, to be deposited before
an act can be applied for (at present one-tenth part of the
capitalsubscribed), and also to perform such other acts only
as are necessary for constituting the company, or for obtain
ing letters patent, or a charter, or an act of parliament. They
may not, however, make calls, nor contract for or hold
lands, nor enter into any contracts for any services, or for
the execution of any works, or for the supply of any stores,
except such services, or stores, or other things as are
necessarily required for the establishing of the company;
and, except any purchase or other contract to be made
conditional on the completion of the company, and to take
effect after the certificate of complete registration, act of
Parliament, or charter, or letters patent shall have been
obtained, and except (in the case of companies requiring
an act of Parliament) coutracts for services in making
surveys, and performing all other acts necessary for obtain
ing an act of incorporation, or other act for enabling the
company to execute their works. (a)
Hence the directors of a railway company, provisionally
registered, are empowered not only to take such steps as
may be necessary to insure the formation and internal
completeness of the company, but such also as are neces
sary for procuring their act of parliament. Thus they may
make surveys and contract for the services of competent
persons for that purpose; they may obtain the assistance
of counsel, solicitors, and parliamentary agents, of engi
neers, draughtsmen, and accountants, and any other
(a) 7 & 8 Vict, c. 110, s. 23.
CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 19
The letters of allotment are usually returned to the se
cretary by the respective bankers after the time for pay
ment of the deposits has expired.
sEC. III.—Execution of Deeds.
WHEN a subscriber has received his letter of allotment,
and paid the deposit, his next business is to make appli
cation for permission to execute the parliamentary or sub
scription contract, and the subscribers’ agreement; for
which purpose, days are usually fixed by the directors, and
notice thereof given to the allottees. Evidence should be
required on the production of the banker's receipt for that
purpose, that the holder is the person to whom the shares
were allotted. The applicant is usually identified by re
quiring him to indorse his name on the banker’s receipt,
and by then comparing the indorsement with the signature
to the letter of application for shares.
On the execution of the above deeds, and the delivery
of the banker’s receipt at the offices of the company, the
subscriber will receive scrip to the amount of the shares
for which he has subscribed. A scrip certificate is a docu
ment usually signed by two or more of the directors, ac
knowledging that the holder thereof, having executed the
parliamentary contract and subscribers’ agreement, and
paid the proper deposit, is entitled to the number of shares

therein mentioned. As to the transferability of scrip, and
the rights and liabilities of vendors and purchasers of scrip,
see post (a).
As the signing the parliamentary contract and sub
scribers' agreement materially alters the position of a party
who has merely paid his deposit on the shares allotted, by
converting the agreement to become a partner into an
actual partnership (b), which will be considered to have

20 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book 1.
commenced from the time of the payment of his deposit (a),
it is advisable for an allottee, previous to his doing so, to
require some evidence that he is not likely to be one of a
few who may come in to execute the deeds; lest, after
rendering himself liable “in solido” to the expenses in
curred, it should afterwards turn out that a sufficient
amount of deposit was not forthcoming to meet the parlia
mentary outlay, and he himself should be made responsible
for heavy claims against the company. Although by the
conditions inserted in the prospectus and letter of allot
ment, the refusal of an allottee to execute the usual deeds
might entail a forfeiture of the amount of his deposit, even
that would be better than to incur a liability of an inde
finite amount to third parties by making himself a partner.
Nor is it sufficient, before executing the deeds, that a sub
scriber satisfy himself as to the amount of deposit actually
paid; he should also ascertain, for his own security, as far
as practicable, the number of the subscribers, and their
ability to meet the engagements they have entered into
with the company.
This can easily be shown by reference to the banker's
book and the return of the letters of allotment upon which
the deposit has been paid. Every subscriber being en
titled to such information, any refusal to afford it would
be in itself a suspicious circumstance and one calculated
to throw doubt upon the bona fides of the undertaking.
Should the promoters of the company, in the event of a
refusal on the part of the allottee to execute the deeds,
take any proceedings in equity to compel such execution,
it would probably be held a sufficient answer if the
defendant could show either any fraud on the part of the
plaintiffs in the distribution of shares, or such a state of
things as, even in the absence of fraud, precluded any
reasonable prospect of a successful establishment of the
company.
We shall now point out the form and nature of the
(a) Lawler v. Kershaw, M. & M. 93, Tenterden.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 31
scribers’ agreement executed to the extent required by the
standing orders of parliament. And inasmuch as the
application for shares, although coupled with an allotment,
is not a sufficient guarantee that the deposit will be paid,
and the deeds executed; and the power to sue parties
applying for shares, and refusing or neglecting to take
them up, is a remedy which, however effectual, is too
tardy to prevent the main objects of the promoters from
being defeated by the delay which must necessarily ensue
if they be driven to avail themselves of it; it would be
better to have those important preliminary conditions of
an application to parliament fulfilled before any serious
liabilities are incurred in the service of the company.
It was evidently the intention of the framers of the
7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, first, that no person should be held out
to the world as a provisional committee-man, or promoter
of a company, without a written consent, on the part of
such provisional committee-man to become such, and also
a written agreement, entered into with some one or more
persons as trustees for the said company, to take one or
more shares in the company, and signed by the person
intending to act as such. Secondly, that no person should
be appointed or act as patron, president or director, whether
honorary or otherwise, unless at the time of the appoint
ment, and of his acting as such, he held at least one share
in the proposed company (a). With regard to the latter
provision, it is unnecessary to make any remarks, as the
clause in question does not apply to companies which fall
within the proviso of the second section of the statute, and
therefore is not applicable to railway companies. As to
the former, namely, that relating to the agreement in
writing, to act as a promoter, and to take one or more
shares in the intended company, we have already seen (b),
that notwithstanding the provisions of the statute, a party

may act as a promoter, although he has entered into no
such agreement, and hence he may incur the liability, as
he may assume the character of a promoter without any
compliance with the statutory regulations; so that although
the publicly advertising as a provisional committee-man, a
person who has never given his consent in the manner
prescribed by the statute, may render the promoters (or
their solicitor) liable to penalties, for omitting to register
such consent within a month after the necessary par
ticulars shall have been ascertained, yet the question of
connexion with the company, and consequently of liability,
remains entirely unaffected by such omission, and in this
respect compliance or non-compliance with the statute is
utterly immaterial. Satisfactory proof of such facts as
would have fixed a party with liability before the passing
of the statute, are amply sufficient for the purpose since.
In discussing the question of liability, therefore, as it
affects the provisional committee of a railway company,
we shall proceed on the doctrines and principles of the
common law, because neither the Joint Stock Registration
Act, nor anyother, contains anyprovisions at all altering the
relations of such persons to third parties during the period
of provisional registration, either by modifying or restrict
ing their rights, or varying their remedies. Claims by and
upon a company provisionally registered, or any members
of it, upon or by any person, are to be enforced and re
sisted like any other claims, and determined by the ordi
nary rules of the common law. We may leave out of
consideration, therefore, in this inquiry, the 7 & 8 Vict.
c. 110, as having no connexion with the subject.
So we must disentangle ourselves of all that is technical
and conventional in the terms employed to designate
those whose liabilities we are considering; terms in
vented to describe the special connexion which certain
parties have with a company at the different stages of its
existence, but which, as being utterly unknown to the
common law, have no definite and intelligible signification,
CHAP. 11.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 33
when used in legal documents, or reiterated in arguments
in court. Such are the words and expressions, “pro
moters,” “directors,” “provisional or managing com
mittee,” and the like. It is convenient (indeed necessary)
to employ them, but we shall err if we fail to remember
that it is the real relations sustained, and not the nominal
position or office of the party, by which his liabilities must
be determined. What the man has done, and not what he
may be called, is the point to be ascertained, when we would
understand the legal incidents of the position in which he is
placed, or when we would attain a clear and definite notion
of his connexion with a transaction on which he may sue, or
on which he may be sued. If an individual has contracted,
personally or by means of another whom he has authorised
to act on his behalf, he will be liable, though no conven
tional designation be affixed to his name; but if he have not
so contracted, personally or by his authorised agent, he will
not be liable, though he be called a promoter, a director,
or (worse than all) a provisional committee-man.
Of the contracts upon which the members of a pro
visional committee, or other promoters of a company, are
sued, by far the larger proportion consist of such as were
entered into by some other party than the defendant, and
the ground on which it is sought to fix him with liability
is, either that the real contractor was a partner with the
defendant in the business concerning which the contract
was made, and had authority therefore to pledge the de
fendant's credit in the transaction; or that the contracting
party was the legally authorised and constituted agent,
servant, or representative, of a co-partnership of which the
defendant was a member, and by whose acts he will there
fore be bound. In a word, it is contended either that all
the members of a provisional committee are partners, so
that each one is empowered to pledge the credit of the
others in partnership matters, and that a managing com
mittee are the appointed agents of the provisional com
mittee; or that the secretary, solicitor, engineer, or other
D
34 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book 1.
officer, is the lawful agent of either of those bodies, by
whose acts they will jointly and individually be bound. All
the difficulties which have arisen in determining the lia
bilities of the parties sued, have sprung from the variety
and complexity of the facts and circumstances to which the
rules of law were to be applied, and not at all from any
uncertainty in the rules themselves.
How incurred. At common law there are two ways in which a person
may incur the liabilities of a partner: first, by an actual
participation, or right to participate, in the profit and loss
of the concern, which is a real partnership; and secondly,
by such an interference in the management of it as may
reasonably lead others to conclude he is a partner, or by
representing himself, or consenting that others should re
present him in that character, which is an ostensible part
nership. We shall treat of these in their order.
By taking The first and most usual criterion of the existence of a
shares. partnership is a community of profit and loss; and con
sequently a person renders himself liable as a partner in
an unincorporated company by taking one or more shares
in the undertaking. It has been repeatedly held, there
fore, that where a provisional committee-man acquires a
right to shares in such company by the execution of the
deeds, he will be to all intents a partner with the other
members, and will be liable as such to third parties. (a) The
provisional committee-men being liable in respect of their
shares in the same manner and to the same extent as the
rest of the shareholders, we shall treat more fully of that
liability in a subsequent part of this work (b).
Byinterference But a right to participate in the profits of a concern,
£" however, is not the only mode of creating a partnership,
because, so far as third parties are concerned, the relations
of partnership may be established and the obligations of it

imposed, not only by an actual participation in the profit
and loss of the speculation, which beyond all controversy
identifies the individual so sharing the risks of the enter
prise with those with whom he is associated in prosecuting
it; but also, secondly, by a person’s taking part in the
proceedings of the association and openly connecting him
self with the management of its affairs, by attending meet
ings, giving orders, and the like.
Thus, attendance at meetings, though no other active part
be taken in the affairs of the company, and though the
attendance be only occasional, or even at a single meet
ing (a), is sufficient to make a party liable. So, although
the defendant were not present at the meeting at which
the order was given, if by attendance at subsequent meet
ings, or inspection of the works in progress, he could be
presumed to have sanctioned the order, he will be liable (b).
So, also, even where the party sued had ceased altogether
to attend the meetings before the contract sued upon was
entered into (c).
Where a certain number have been selected out of the
general body of the provisional committee to act as a com
mittee of management, and they assume the office and
undertake to conduct the affairs of the association, the
members thereof will be primarily liable for all expenses
incurred, in consequence of their orders, or of the orders
of their secretary or servant, when the authority is shown
to have been given (d). So, also, a majority at any meet
ing (a quorum being present, if provided for in the sub
scribers' agreement) would have an implied, if not an
express right under deed, to pledge the credit of their
co-committee men in relation to all matters within the
scope of their authority. As to the liability of those who

take this active part in the management of a company's
affairs, doubts can seldom arise (a).
A third mode by which a person may render himself
liable as a partner is by representing himself, or consent
ing that others should represent him, as jointly embarked
in the promotion of some scheme, to which he thus lends
the sanction of his name, and affords the advantage of his
credit and reputation. Under these circumstances it has
been justly held that although such person was neither
engaged to contribute funds for the purposes of the asso
ciation, nor entitled to share its profits, yet on grounds of
public policy, and to prevent the frauds upon creditors
consequent on a system of fictitious and illusory credit
resulting from honorary patronage of mercantile schemes,
all the parties whose names are published as promoters of
the enterprise should be deemed partners and be made
liable as such. (b)
Thus a party may be rendered liable by permitting his
name to be held out as a patron, director, or member of
the provisional committee of a company; nor does it
appear necessary that he should, in addition to his assent
to act, have attended meetings, taken shares, or in any
other way have interfered in the management of the
concern. (c)
As to what will be a sufficient consent on the part of
an individual to act as a provisional committee man, we
may remark that if the party have complied with the
requirements of the Joint Stock Registration Act, by
signing a written agreement to act in that capacity, and
to take one or more shares in the company, no question
can arise on the subject. But it is not by any means

necessary that this should have been done in order to fix
a party with liability—a written request to have his name
inserted in the list of the provisional committee, or a
written consent to that effect, though unaccompanied with
any agreement to take shares, would suffice, it only being
necessary that the publishing the name to the world
should be the act of the party himself; and this must
appear either by his express or implied assent. If the
provisions of the 7 & 8 Vict, c. 110 have been complied
with, the registered consent to act will be conclusive
evidence of the liability of the party on more grounds
than one; on the ground of its proving the existence of a
partnership between himself and the other members of
the company, and also on the ground of its furnishing
unanswerable testimony to the fact of the publication of
his name being his own act and deed. But the latter
may be proved although no registered, or even written,
consent can be produced. If the name of the defendant
be inserted in the prospectus, and he be shown to have
done any act from which his sanction of that insertion
may be fairly inferred, such as calling at the offices of the
company, making inquiries as to its affairs, claiming the
number of shares usually allotted to the members of the
provisional committee, and the like, this will be evidence
for the jury to shew his consent to fill the situation with
the liabilities of which the plaintiff seeks to charge him.
Even if the responsibility to third parties of an individual
sued as a provisional committee-man, on the ground of his
assent to act as such, depended upon the fact that the sta
tutory consent was given, it would seem that, on the proof
of such facts as are mentioned above, the Court would pre
sume that such assent was given. (a)

general business and objects of the association, have pro
ceeded on the broad principles of the common law, in re
ference to parties associated together for a common object,
and on the supposition that the promoters of a public
company were partners. The assumed analogy, however,
between ordinary cases of partnership and the projectors
of public companies, has lately come under the considera
tion of the Court of Exchequer in two important cases,
and that analogy has been denied. It has been held in
those cases (a), that the fact of a party having given a
written consent to act as a provisional committee-man
does not make him a partner with the others, and that one
member of a provisional committee does not appoint the
others his agents, so as to bind him by their acts. Hence
the simple fact of being a member of a provisional com
mittee does not involve an individual in the responsibilities
of a partnership. The position (considered apart from the
acts and conduct of the party) is one to which the law
attaches no definite obligations: it amounts to nothing.
But if the fact of being a member of a provisional com
mittee be nothing, the holding out of the name as such
cannot be more; and therefore such representation with
the defendant’s express consent is said to involve no liabi
lity; it is a consent to be a provisional committee-man,
and to be advertised as such, and nothing more. Then,
if there be no relations analogous to those of partnership
among the members of the body in question, the applica
tion of the doctrine of implied agency becomes impossible.
Each member of a mercantile firm impliedly gives autho
rity to the others to bind him in matters connected with
their business; but no such authority can be inferred
where no similar relations are sustained. But if there be
no partnership connection and obligations between mem
bers of a provisional committee, and if one be not agent
(a) Reynell v. Lewis, and Wyld v. Hopkins, Sittings after Michaelmas
Term, 1846.
Ch.A.P. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 39
for the others in relation to the company’s affairs, to show
the mere fact that a defendant was a member, is to give
no evidence to fix him with liability on a contract, unless
he entered into it himself. If some other member of the
provisional committee contracted, the party sued is not
responsible, for the contracting party was not his agent,
and could not bind him; and therefore it is sought to
make him responsible on a contract into which he never
entered, personally, or by a lawful agent, and on which
he is not liable, either primarily or secondarily.
The decision from which the above inferences are drawn,
proceeds on the assumption that the defendant is a mem
ber of a provisional committee, having his name on the
list, and nothing more. If, however, the list be published
in a prospectus, and the defendant be shown to have been
cognizant of the contents of that document, it may be con
sidered as equivalent to his saying all which is there set
forth, and expressing his sanction and approval of all that
is there suggested as proper to be done. Liability for
subsequent expenses will then depend on the terms of this
prospectus, and the fair conclusion to be drawn from the
fact that the defendant appended his name to it.
The question on which the liability of a provisional
committee-man will turn, whether partnership be con
tended for or not, is that of principal and agent. If the
contracting party was the defendant's agent, he was so
either by virtue of some formal, solemn, and express au
thority given, which is rarely the case, or by some implied
authority. The law will not infer any such implied autho
rity between the members of a provisional committee as
such. A jury, however, looking at all the facts and cir
cumstances of the case, may infer such authority in any
individual instance. As a general rule, it would be un
reasonable to conclude that a person affixing his name to
the list, and assenting to act as a member of a provisional
committee, constitutes every other individual who may
chance to have his name added thereto his agent. Even

where a committee of management is formed for the pur
pose of conducting the affairs of the association, it cannot
always be reasonably inferred that each individual member
of the provisional committee constitutes that committee
his agents, so as to become responsible for every act which
they may do, and every liability which they may incur (a).
But if the defendant’s name be appended to a prospec
tus naming the committee of management, and specifying
the general course to be adopted in forwarding the objects
of the company, there would be reasonable evidence of an
implied authority to the managing committee to pledge
the credit of the defendant for reasonable expenses in
curred. Nevertheless, as this implied agency is not an
inference of law from the mere relation of the parties (it
may be gathered from some of the recent cases that) be
fore a jury can find it, they must be of opinion that the
defendant intended to give authority to pledge his credit,
and that he knew something of the mature and amount of
the debts about to be incurred, and consented to be re
sponsible for them (b). Where the managing committee
were the original projectors of the scheme, and were ex
isting and acting before the formation of a provisional
committee, it is not reasonable to conclude that the latter
consented to be responsible for their acts (c).
In a recent case at nisi prius (since the decisions in
Reynell v. Lewis and Wyld v. Hopkins), Lord Denman
intimated that where a person allowed his name to be held
out to the world as a partner he would be liable for the
acts of his co-partners without its being shown that he had
given any direct assent to the particular contract; and
said, “in ordinary cases of partnership, where the names
of the partners are painted over a shop-door, it is not in
cumbent on a party in giving credit to one to inquire

CHAP. 11.] FORMATION OF TIE COMPANY. 41
whether the others have sanctioned it; it will be assumed
that in allowing their names to appear, they authorise par
ties to deal with the others upon their credit. The same
principle applies to this case; here the defendant has
authorised his name to be placed on the published list of
the provisional committee; and it may be supposed that
the public have given credit to the company on the fact of
his name appearing in the list, the same as with partners
whose names are painted over a shop.” (a). It is not
easy, at first sight, to reconcile the doctrines here pro
pounded, which agree with the rules of the common law,
and have been acted on in a long series of cases by emi
nent judges, with the view recently taken by the Court of
Exchequer.
In a still more recent case (b), the same learned judge
(after adverting to the cases of Reynell v Lewis and Wyld
v. Hopkins, and expressing his approval of those decisions
so far as they distinguished the case of the members of a
provisional committee from a partnership or a quasi part
nership) directed the jury that provisional committee-men,
being associated together as the members of a body acting
for a particular object, must be considered as having in
dividually assented to the measures taken by that body, or
any authorised members thereof, for the promotion of that
object. That it frequently happens that in expressly
authorising the doing of one thing, many others are im
pliedly sanctioned, as being closely connected with it, or
essentially necessary for its accomplishment. As, if a
man be instructed to build a house, he is impliedly em
powered to procure the materials necessary for it: so, if
the object be the formation and constitution of a company,
all such things as may be essential for that purpose are
included in the general authority to form it. That it will,
nevertheless, in each case be a question for the jury

whether the defendant, in joining the provisional com
mittee, did so with the view of sanctioning and promoting
the formation of the company, and did thereby impliedly
consent that his credit should be pledged, by his co-com
mittee-men, or their agents, in taking all necessary steps
for the accomplishing of that object. That if the jury
should find these questions in the affirmative, the liability
of the defendant is conclusively established on any lawful
contract essential to the establishment of the company,
whether entered into by himself personally, or by any
other members of the committee, or by their secretary and
solicitor duly authorised.
From the last two cases, it may be gathered that
although the members of a provisional committee sustain
no relation to each other identical with or closely analo
gous to that of partners at common law, yet that, as being
publicly associated together for the furtherance of a com
mon object, the consent of any individual to join the body
(which must mean something) can mean only an approval
of the proposed object, and a sanction of the effort to
accomplish it, by their combined exertions. That if this
be the proper interpretation of the act of a person joining
the committee, this general and express approval of the
object may reasonably be deemed to include the implied
(but not less essential) sanction of the necessary steps for
securing it; and that this sanction makes the act of any
other member of the body in furtherance thereof his own
act, on the well-understood principles of implied agency.
The general result of the decisions in Reynell v. Lewis,
and Wyld v. Hopkins, would appear to be, that it will be a
question for the jury, in each case, whether the defendant
made the contract upon which he is sued, either by him
self or by his agent duly authorised for that purpose, and
that it must be collected from all the facts of the parti
cular case, how far each member of the provisional com
mittee authorised the other members of it, or the members
of the managing committee, or the secretary, solicitor, or
CHA P. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 43
other person who gave the order, to pledge his credit in
respect of the contract on which the action is brought.
The apparent discrepancy between the cases relating to this
subject, divides them into two classes, distinguished each
from the other not so much by any difference in the inter
pretation of the rules or principles of law, as by a disagree
ment as to which rule or principle is most applicable to the
circumstances under consideration. If the Common Law
doctrines of ostensible partnership from the joint publica
tion of names to the world, as of persons interested in the
promotion of one and the same object, be applied to pro
jected companies, any member of a provisional committee
would appear to be liable on all the obligations incurred by
his co-promoters in the service of the company, and the
problem is solved at once by a summary application of
those doctrines. The defendant and the contracting party
each has his name on the list, therefore, though not ac
tually yet constructively, the former entered into the con
tract, for the act of the other was his act; as far as the
world was concerned they were partners, jointly interested
in the undertaking, and jointly and individually liable for
their own and for each other's acts in furtherance of the
scheme: and there is a verdict for the plaintiff. But if to
a similar state of facts the doctrine of principal and agent
at Common-Law be applied, the result will be more favour
able for the party sought to be fixed with liability. It is
them argued: on this contract the defendant is not respon
sible unless he entered into it. Did he then contract with
the plaintiff? Not personally, that is admitted, nor yet by
an agent having direct, formal, and explicit authority from
him for that purpose; but by an agent having an autho
rity to be implied under the circumstances stated: then is
it so? The law will not infer the implied agency from the
mere relation of the parties, as in the case of partners at
Common-Law, or of husband and wife; but if no such in
cidents attach at law to the existing relations, it must be
shewn as a matter of fact, or of reasonable inference or
44 RAI LWAY COMPANIES. [Book 1.
presumption, that the implied authority to pledge his credit
was intended to be given by the defendant; that he meant
to authorise each co-committee-man to contract for him,
and intended to be bound by their acts, and to be liable on
the obligations they incurred. In other words, it must be
proved that the orders given by another, and the goods
supplied to another, were orders given by the defendant
and goods supplied to him, constructively, so as to make
him answerable in the action brought against him for their
price. In order to shew this, two points must be made
out, first, that the goods were really supplied, or the orders
executed, on the credit of the defendant; (a) and, secondly,
that the defendant authorised the contracting party to
pledge his credit; and unless both are found in the affirma
tive, the defendant is not liable. If the doctrine of part
nership, or quasi partnership, among the members of a
provisional committee be maintained, this important con
sequence follows, that no sooner is the character assumed,
than a real substantial liability attaches on all contracts
made by the others for the purposes of the company,
whether the plaintiff knew of the defendants’ connection
with the scheme or not; so that it will be unnecessary to
prove that it was done on his credit, the cases shewing the
liability of secret partners in a firm being strictly appli
cable to that state of things. (b)
However difficult it may appear to be to reconcile the
cases above cited, and the opinions of the several judges
who presided at the trials thereof, yet, from a general
view of the seemingly conflicting decisions, this conclusion
may perhaps be safely drawn: that where any question
arises as to the liability on a contract of any member of a
provisional or managing committee, or board of provisional
or managing directors, after proof of all material facts in
(a) See Lambert v. Knill, 1846.

Cil AP 11.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY.
the case, it will be rather for the jury to say what respon
sibility was incurred by the defendant in fact, than for the
judge to declare what responsibility attached upon him in
law; that such liability must be inferred from circumstances
as a matter of fact, not deduced from the mere relation of the
parties as a matter of law; and that its nature and extent
as well as its existence must be left with the jury, and not
be determined by the judge; and therefore that no legal
doctrines, whether of partnership or agency, can be judi
cially applied to the facts proved to ascertain the liability
of a defendant, but the jury must decide on the effect of
these facts, guided in their decision by such a statement
of general principles as to the judge may appear right.
Ifthe liability of a provisional committee-man be any way
established, whether it be laid down as law (on the doctrine
of a quasi partnership) or be inferred as a matter offact (on
the doctrine of express or implied agency), it would seem
that it commences immediately on the assumption of that
character, as soon, that is, as the consent, verbal or written
(and the agreement required by the Joint Stock Act is
conclusive in the absence of even the least interference), or
the conduct indicative of such consent has furnished reason
able proof of his connection with the scheme. Hence he
may become liable as such before he has signed the sub
scription contract, and it will be assumed that he has done
so, even if it be shewn that he has not. (a)
This liability will extend to all contracts entered into
by parties properly authorised, whether members of the
provisional or managing committee or their lawful agents,
provided they were made in furtherance of the objects of
the association, were necessary for the formation of the
company, and were such as might lawfully be made since
the passing of the Joint Stock Act. And if the members
of a provisional committee have duly appointed a com

mittee of management, contracts lawfully made by a
majority of the latter to promote the objects mentioned
in the prospectus will bind the rest. Upon each of these
a provisional committee-man will be liable upon proof of
such facts as shew him to be a member of that body, con
curring in the appointment of the committee of manage
ment, whose acts are therefore his own, so long as the
limit of the delegated authority is not transgressed. (a)
Where, however, the managers of the company make
any agreement, or enter into any contract, beyond the
scope of their authority as defined by the above statute,
or limited by the terms of the prospectus, it will be neces
sary, in order to fix a defendant with liability, to shew
that he either directly interfered in the making of the
contract, or expressly sanctioned it afterwards. This dis
tinction is in accordance with the general law of partner
ship, under which any member of the firm will be held
responsible for all acts done, and proceedings taken by
any other member of it, for the promotion of the business
and objects of the partnership, so long as those acts and
proceedings are within the scope of the authority given
to one or more to act on behalf of the whole; but where
the thing done was either not in furtherance of the
partnership business, or without the province of the party
to perform in the name and on the behalf of the firm, no
liability will attach except to those who were immediately
concerned in it.
This liability also extends only to contracts made sub
sequently to the time at which the party first, either by
acting or consenting to act on the provisional committee,
authorised the pledging of his own credit thereon : and
not to contracts made previously, of which the incoming
member, however, receives the benefit, (b) not even in case

CHAP. II.] EORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 47
of express admission of liability. (a) The reason of this
rule is well explained by Mr. Justice Story. (b) “A
contract can be obligatory only upon those who are parties
to it, or derive a benefit from it at the time of its inception.
The joint interest, or joint liability, must be contempo
raneous with the formation of the contract itself in order
to superinduce the corresponding liability to perform it;
and if there be no partnership then in existence to be
bound, or none which is a party or privy to the contract,
it cannot be deemed their contract but solely that of
those who contracted and were capable of contracting at
the time. Otherwise the law would introduce the extra
ordinary anomaly of making a contract, consummate and
perfect between all the original parties, expand so as to
be in fact the contract of other parties, who had not, and
perhaps could not, at the time, have any interest in, or
privity or connection therewith.”
It was held, however, in two cases at Nisi Prius (c), that
although a provisional committee-man was not liable on
contracts executed previously to his joining the company,
still he was liable on such as, though made before, re
mained, either in whole or in part, executory at the time
of his becoming a member. These decisions are not irre
concileable with the general principles stated above. The
actions in question were not brought on entire contracts
entered into previously, although executed subsequently,
to the defendant's joining the company, but for goods sold
and delivered, and work and labour performed, some por
tion previously, and the remainder subsequently, to the
time when the defendants respectively became members of
the committee; so that each separate delivery of goods, or
performance of work, might be regarded as equivalent to
a new contract.

The liability of the members of a provisional committee
once established, is a joint liability, and hence all the com
tracting parties should be joined in an action (a); but the
only advantage which can be taken by a defendant of the
non-joinder of the rest, is by plea in abatement, which, in
the case of an action against a member of a provisional
committee, is virtually impracticable, as the plea must
truly state the names of all the parties liable, and also
that they were living and resident within the jurisdiction
of the court at the time of the commencement of the
action; and should any name be omitted, the plea will
not be supported (b). Nor would the fact that another
action for the same cause was pending against other mem
bers of the committee be an answer; (c) although, if judg
ment had been recovered against one of the body, such
judgment without satisfaction would be a bar to an action
on the same contract against any of the others (d).
It seems, however, to have been intimated, that if the
defendant dissented in respect of the contract in question,
and the contracting party had notice of such dissent, a de
fendant would not be liable, (e) although the contract was
made by an assenting majority of provisional committee
men. On the doctrine of implied agency between the
members, the discharge of a dissentient from liability can
be understood, as by his conduct he expressly negatives
the idea of his authorising the rest to act for him in the
particular transaction. But if these committees are to
be considered as analogous to partnerships, the question
arises whether a majority is to govern in case of diversity
of opinion as to the mode of conducting the partnership

business, or whether one dissentient can arrest the partner
ship business, or suspend the ordinary powers and autho
rity of the other partners in relation thereto, against the
will of the majority. According to Mr. Justice Story, (a)
“where there is no stipulation to the contrary, a majority
acting bona fide, have the right and authority to conduct
the partnership business within the true scope thereof, not
withstanding the dissent of the minority.” Although the
above doctrine is laid down by so great an authority, it
does not seem to be established by any decisions in our
courts of law; and, indeed, the cases which relate to this
subject, seem to imply an opinion to the contrary. Thus
in Vice v. Fleming, (b) C. B. Alexander said, “it is clear
that the defendant might, by an absolute notice, have dis
charged himself from all further liability, whether he
ceased or continued to be a partner.” In the same case,
Mr. Justice Garrow added, “all the partners of a firm are
liable for the debts of the firm, but the responsibility may
be limited by express notice by one that he will not be
liable for the acts of his co-partners.”
Whatever may be the law on the subject in the case of
ordinary partnerships, it is desirable that an assenting
majority should, as to all matters relating to the business
for which the company was formed, have authority to bind
a dissenting minority; otherwise it would be in the power
of any few dissentients either to suspend the affairs of the
company, or to get rid of liability on contracts, ofwhich the
dissentients themselves would receive the ultimate benefits.
But however an individual member of a provisional com
mittee may be able, by express notice in certain cases, to
limit his general liability, it would seem that having once
assumed that character, and incurred the obligations be
longing to it, he cannot by any act of his own divest him
self of the character, or discharge himself from the obliga

tions as long as the company remains unincorporated; at
all events, if a partmership exists among the members. It
seems questionable, whether even though he withdraw from
the concern with the consent of all his co-committee-men,
and publicly disavow all future connection with its affairs,
and all future right to any share of its profits, he can suc
ceed in escaping the liability of his position; inasmuch as
doubt has been thrown upon the right of his associates to
consent to his withdrawal. (a)
A company formed for the construction of a railway is a
partnership for a specific purpose, which cannot be dis
solved at the mere will of any party desirous of withdraw
ing, nor even with the consent of any number of his col
leagues, less than the whole, (which will include every
shareholder) until that specific purpose has been carried
out, or the respective rights, remedies, and liabilities of the
members and of third parties, have been regulated by an
act of incorporation. He can then discharge himself of
liability in the mode therein prescribed.

AFTER letters of allotment have been issued to the appli
cants a new legal relation is constituted, and new rights and
liabilities arise thereupon. The promoters and the allottees
respectively acquire rights and incur liabilities in virtue
of the contract which has been entered into between them.
The nature of these has been much disputed. Part of the
difficulty has arisen from the terms of the instruments
setting forth the conditions of the agreement. This, how
ever, by a proper form of the letter of allotment, may be
easily obviated.

CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 51
On receiving a letter of allotment, the allottee becomes Liability of al
liable to perform the conditions of his own contract; that lottee thereon.
is, to accept the allotted shares, to pay the deposit thereon,
and to sign the deeds. The provisional committee become
liable to accept the deposit when tendered, and to permit
the allottee to execute the Parliamentary contract and the
subscribers’ agreement. The rule that one partner cannot At common
sue another at common law, except on an express cove-"
nant, or on an account stated, does not apply to the case
under consideration, which is that of a breach of agree
ment to become a partner, and where an action will clearly
lie (a). Although sustainable in point of law, there are,
however, practical difficulties of a serious kind in the
adoption of this remedy against a party neglecting to pay
the deposit and take up the shares allotted.
In the first place, the necessity of suing in the names
of all the persons who, at the time of the contract made,
were members of the provisional committee, together with
all who had then signed the deeds, and were, therefore,
partners; the cumbersomeness and difficulty of proof,
and liability to mistakes, which in their consequences
would be fatal, render an action at law almost impractic
able. Moreover, the risk that some one of the numerous
plaintiffs might be induced to give the defendant a release,
and thereby furnish him with a triumphant answer to the
claim, is another formidable objection to the proceeding. (b)
The contingency that the court might hold the release
fraudulent, and order the plea to be struck off the re
cord, is too slight to diminish to any considerable ex
tent the force of the objection (c).
These inconveniences are in a great degree precluded,
where, in the form of application for shares, the allottees
agree with certain parties named as trustees on behalf

of the company, to pay the deposit and sign the deeds, as
the trustees will then be entitled to sue in their own
names. The remedy in equity against an allottee refusing
to execute his contract, is not encumbered with so many
difficulties as that in law. A court of equity, indeed, will
refuse to interfere where the object of the application is to
establish a general partnership, which might be dissolved
immediately afterwards at the option of any member of it.
But they will decree a specific performance of an agree
ment to become a partner, in all cases in which the pro
posed relation is to be established for a definite period, or
for the accomplishment of some specific object (a). The
grounds of this exercise of an equitable jurisdiction are
ably stated by Mr. J. Story, in his work on the Law of
Partnership. He says, “other of the intended partners
may have incurred responsibilities on account of the in
tended partnership; or preliminary steps for the business
of such intended partnership may have been taken, and
acts done putting the same into an inchoate and imperfect
operation, upon the full faith and confidence of a puncti
lious discharge of duties by the other side; so that it
might work a most serious, if not irreparable, mischief
and injury, not to enforce the specific performance of the
contract, so as to bind all the parties to the acts done,
and to the responsibilities incurred (b). Where specific
performance of an agreement to become a partner is de
creed, the partnership (if no particular date has been fixed
by the contract) will be deemed to commence from the
period when the contract itself was completed (c). An
allottee, consequently, will be considered a partner from
the time the allotment was made (d). It was formerly

held that, in any suit by partners, all the members of the
firm should be joined as plaintiffs; otherwise a demurrer
would lie for want of equity, on the ground of the non
joinder of the proper parties. If this were so, the cumber
someness and difficulty attending the remedy in equity
would be equal to that at common law; although, how
ever, there are no cases in which the non-joinder of all the
members of a company has been urged as an objection
against the proceedings, and therefore no decision directly
in point can be cited; yet, in recent suits, instituted by
one or more shareholders of a company, on behalf of them
selves and the rest, against the directors for misappropria
tion of the funds, it has been held that a demurrer would
not lie on the ground that all the shareholders should have
been joined (a). From this, therefore, we may infer, that
in case of a bill filed to compel a specific performance of
an agreement to join the association, if all the members of
the managing committee were made plaintiffs, no objection
could be taken on account of the non-joinder of the other
shareholders.
It is not unusual in letters of allottment to insert a clause
to the effect that the allotment will become void in case
the deposit should not be paid on or before the day named,
and that in such case the directors reserve to themselves
power to rescind the allotment, and reallot the shares.
Under these circumstances questions may arise; first,
whether the insertion of such a proviso is not an introduc
tion of new matter, which would have the effect of avoiding
the original contract; (b) and, secondly, whether payment
on or before the day named is not a condition precedent
of which the allottee can take advantage. As to the first
point it is submitted, that the insertion of the clause in
question is not such an introduction of new matter into
the contract as can suffice to vacate it, the power of for

feiture reserved to the committee being incidental to their
office and functions as the managing body, and without
such power it would be impossible to form a company. On
the second point it seems clear, that if the provisional com
mittee are ready to perform their part of the contract
within reasonable time, the allottee cannot avail himself of
punctual payment as a condition precedent, by the non
fulfilment ofwhich he may escape from the obligations of his
agreement, (a) and thus take advantage of his own wrong.
The power to forfeit is an additional remedy, of which the
directors may avail themselves or not, and they are there
fore at liberty either to rescind or to enforce the contract.
These powers, however, are of less importance where the
letter of allotment contains no proviso of forfeiture, or
where the proviso expressly states that it shall be in the
option of the managing committee to forfeit and reallot the
shares or enforce the payment against the allottee.
As the allotment of shares, even when coupled with
payment of the deposit, does not of itself constitute an
allottee a partner with the provisional directors of a com
pany, neither will it make him a partner as regards third
parties. An allottee is not a partner in fact, the payment
of the deposit and the banker’s receipt given thereon does
not give him a right in the partnership property, but merely
a right in equity to have an assignment of a portion thereof
according to the number of shares he holds. Thus, when
in an action for goods supplied to a mining company,
it appeared that the defendant had paid money for certain
shares,and received a certificate to that effect, but had never
executed any deed, nor otherwise interfered in the affairs
of the company; it was held that the action could not be
maintained. (b)
The contract between the provisional committee and
the allottee, on the receipt of the letter of allotment, is a

CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 55
contract not of present partnership, but to become a
partner in a certain event. The liability of an allottee to
complete his contract to become a member of the com
pany, and the remedies which the committee may have
against him we have already considered.
If the allottee is compelled by legal process to execute
the deeds, and thereby enrol and constitute himself a
partner in the company, a new state of things arises to
which we shall advert in the next section; but supposing
him to have paid his deposit, and never to be called upon
to sign the deeds, in consequence of the dissolution of the
company, and failure of the scheme without an applica
tion to parliament, and such failure is not attributable to
any fraud or gross mismanagement of the committee, the
question arises whether the allottee is entitled to receive
back the entire amount of deposit, without any rateable
deduction for expenses incurred. This question must be
decided principally upon the terms of the prospectus
which is the basis of the contract between the allottee and
the committee until the partnership is completed by the
execution of the deeds. It is usual in the prospectus to
make some mention of the costs to be incurred in for
warding the proposed company, and if that document so
alludes to them as that by fair intendment it may be
concluded that the allottee was aware of his liability to
share the expenses of the steps to be taken, and impliedly
therefore undertook to pay his proportion of them in any
event, he will be liable accordingly.
The language of the prospectus may easily be framed so
as to preclude dispute upon the subject. But if no under
taking to contribute towards preliminary expenses can be
inferred from the terms of the prospectus, or of the letter
of allotment, and the scheme be entirely abandoned,
the allottee will be entitled to receive back the amount of
his deposit without any deduction being made for preli
minary expenses. His contract was simply to become
partner with others in an event which never happened,

and hence he may claim, in an action for money had and
received, on the ground of a failure of consideration, to be
repaid the full amount which he advanced conditionally,
on the happening of that event. (a) A plaintiff however
will be non-suited unless the letter of allotment which he
offers in evidence be stamped. (b)
It is, however, submitted that delay in making the ap
plication to parliament, from inability on the part of the
managing body to proceed at once,) is not an abandonment
of the scheme which will entitle an allottee to recover back
the amount of his deposit on the ground of a failure of
consideration, inasmuch as in the cases in which such a
right to recover has been decided to belong to allottees,
the circumstances showed an ultimate and entire aban
donment, and not a mere postponement, of the project on
the part of the directors.
sEc. Iv. – Rights, Remedies, and Liabilities of the Ma

the Deeds.
WE have already considered the different members of a
company in several distinct positions, namely as pro
jectors, provisional committee-men, and allottees; it,
therefore, now only remains for us to consider the posi
tion of the managing committee-men in respect of the
parties executing the subscribers’ agreement and parlia
mentary contract, and thereby becoming shareholders,
and also the position of such shareholders with respect to

57
third parties. We shall treat first of the mutual rights
and liabilities of directors and subscribers, and then of
the liabilities of the latter to third parties.
The liability of the managing committee of a pro
jected company to the shareholders will depend in great
measure upon the nature of the contract between the
parties. Ordinarily deeds are prepared and signed by all
the parties to the undertaking, by which each binds
himself to bear a certain proportion of the expenses which
shall be incurred whether the scheme succeed or mis
carry. In this case the governing body are protected by
the terms of the instrument so long as they act in accord
ance with the authority thereby conferred upon them,
and they may lawfully dispose of the funds entrusted to
them in furtherance of the general objects of the associa
tion; nor will they be liable to refund, although the pro
ject should ultimately fail. If, however, the scheme ori
ginated in fraud, and without any probable or reasonable
chance of success, or if there was any fraud in the man
ner of carrying it out, or in case the directors abandoned
the scheme without the concurrence and consent of all
the shareholders, or of such a number of shareholders as
the deed of settlement prescribed, the fact of a party
having executed the deeds, and made himself a partner,
would not preclude him from his right to have the deposit
returned free from all deductions on account of expenses
previously incurred. For although it was decided in the
case of Fox v. Clifton (a), that a party by executing the
deeds made himself a partner in the company, in which
case his remedy against the directors for any fraud or mis
management subsequent to the partnership being com
pleted between himself and them would be in equity
only; yet it has been held at Nisi Prius, (b) that if the
shareholder was induced to execute the deed by gross

fraud and misrepresentation on the part of the directors
that the deed was void, and that the subscriber could sue
the directors for money had and received, and was not com
pelled to resort to a court of equity for his remedy. This
is in accordance with the established principle of law,
which makes void any deed executed by a party whose
execution was procured by covin and misrepresentation.
But the bare fact that the subscription contract was not
executed to the full amount of the proposed capital (in
the absence of fraud), would not be sufficient to support
an action by one of the shareholders who had executed
the deed to recover back the amount of his deposit, his
covenant being absolute and having no reference to any
condition precedent. (a)
The usual remedy, however, in such cases is in a Court
of Chancery. Thus a bill in equity lies to recover back
the deposits paid by a shareholder in a joint stock company
where the project is a bubble (b). So, where the directors
of a joint stock company, in order to sell their shares to
advantage, represented in their reports and by their agents,
that the affairs of the company were in a very prosperous
state, and declared large dividends at a time when the
affairs of the company were greatly embarrassed, a person
who had been induced by those means to purchase shares
of one of the directors was held entitled to relief in equity,
on filing a bill against the director of whom he had made
the purchase (c).
So, for any mis-appropriation of the funds of the com
pany, or for a refusal to refund or account in case of the
miscarriage ofthe scheme, the remedy is to be sought against
the directors in a Court of Equity. Even here, however,
certain supposed legal rules obstructed the administration
of justice in numerous instances. A bill filed in the cases
above mentioned would be for an account, and that the

funds might be applied to the objects of the undertaking,
but then it was thought that such a bill must pray a dis
solution of the partnership, and that all the partners must
necessarily be parties to the suit. Both these notions are
now exploded, and the cases which seemed to support them
are overruled by the decision of Lord Cottenham C. in
Walworth v. Holt, (a) followed by the Master of the
Rolls in the subsequent case of Richardson v. Hastings. (b)
There is little difficulty now, therefore, in finding relief
in equity for shareholders in a company whose funds have
been misapplied by the managing body. The wrong
doers need not all be joined as defendants, nor need the
injured parties all combine to sue, and the bill need not
pray a dissolution in order to obtain the interference of
the court. (c)
The general body of subscribers are liable to the
directors of the association (or to the trustees named in
the parliamentary contract and subscribers’ agreement,
with whom they expressly covenant,) to perform every
thing in accordance with the stipulations of the contract
into which they have entered, and the covenants of the
instrument which they have executed. Thus they are
bound to pay their deposits, and contribute rateably in
proportion to the extent of their share in the undertaking
towards the expenses incurred in carrying it out.
According to the practice now uniformly adopted of
requiring every subscriber to execute the two deeds known
respectively as the subscribers’ agreement and the Parlia
mentary contract, the individual members of the associa
tion are made liable on the terms of their own agreement.
The covenants into which they voluntarily enter, may there
fore be enforced against them in all cases,except those where
fraud may be assigned and proved, or where the association

is itself tainted with illegality, and no action or suit there
fore could be maintained to enforce any engagements which
have been made to promote the objects of it. Thus a
shareholder is always liable on his express covenant with
the trustees of the company to pay up the instalments to
the full amount of his subscription, notwithstanding that
after the act has been obtained, he has not been registered
under it; (a) unless subsequently to the passing of the
act, having paid all calls then due, he transfer his shares
in the mode prescribed (b) by the company’s clauses act;
or, having parted with them previously to the special act
being obtained, the purchaser, on the passing of it,
send them in claiming to be registered, and get his name
inserted in place of the original allottee.(c)
Personal representatives of a subscriber are also liable
for the amount of deposit or instalment, under a covenant
entered into by the deceased with trustees on the part of
the company, binding himself, his executors, and adminis
trators to pay his subscription towards the undertaking (d).
Questions as to the liability of subscribers to a projected
company were formerly incumbered with difficulties arising
out of distinctions taken between an actual and a proposed
partnership between them and the promoters and managers
of the scheme. These doubts were engendered by the
ambiguity of the terms of the provisional agreement or
other instrument under which the inchoate association was
formed. If the words of that document could be construed
as establishing the actual relation of partners between the
subscribers and the managers, the former incurred all the
common-law liabilities involved in that relationship. If,

on the other hand, the deed would not justify such an
interpretation, but imported only an intention on the part
of the subscribers in a certain specified event to become
partners with the promoters of the scheme, and until that
event happened, the subscribers did nothing to connect
themselves further with the company, by attending meet
ings, or the like, then they could not be liable for any
expenses incurred in forwarding the design of the original
promoters. So if the contemplated event never happened
at all, the condition of the contract itself failing, the sub
scribers were held entitled, as on failure of consideration,
to recover back from the promoters the amount of their de
posit in an action for money had and received to their use.
For information as to the law on these points, the cases
cited below may be consulted (a). They establish some
valuable general principles, but the application of them in
individual instances is always determined by the special
circumstances of the case; and they seem rather to apply
to parties who have subscribed for shares in a trading com
pany, but have not executed the deeds. If, however, the
principles of those decisions should be held applicable to
shareholders in railway companies, they are of little im
pertance since 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110, which restrains the power
to contract otherwise than conditionally on the passing of
the act.
As a general rule, in the absence of any express agree
ment, one member of a company has no right of action
against another for work or labour done, and expenses in
curred for the company. Thus, where the agent employed
in carrying the bill into parliament sued the chairman of
the managing committee for the amount of his bill, and it

appeared that the agent was a shareholder in the under

Yet a plaintiff, a member of the company, may main

becoming a shareholder. (b)
After incorporation, however, a shareholder, should the
act contain any clause appropriating the amount of deposit
to the payment of preliminary expenses, would be entitled,
on suing the proper officer of the company, to recover the
amount of his demand out of the fund so appropriated. (c)
So, where the directors of a company have entered into
an express covenant with a shareholder, even in respect of
matters connected with the business of the company, a
right of action thereon will accrue to the covenantee, al
though the relation of partnership subsist between the
plaintiff and the defendant. Thus, where the plaintiffs
and defendants were members of a joint stock company,
and the plaintiff agreed to demise land to the defendants
as trustees for the company, defendants covenanting to
pay him rent, and by a separate deed the plaintiff and the
other members of the company covenanted to indemnify
the defendants for acts done by them as trustees; it was
held that the plaintiff, notwithstanding he was a member
of the company, might sue the defendants on their cove

ciates for work, labour, and services, and money expended,
in and about the business of the company, he has, for any
advances he may have made, a remedy in equity, and is
entitled to be reimbursed all money expended by him in
and for the company, and which he has been compelled to
pay at the suit of third parties (a); but not (except as in the
cases above mentioned) to any recompense on account of
his work and labour, performed in and about the affairs of
the company.
In a former section, we have discussed the liability to
third parties, of persons acting or assenting to act as
provisional committeemen; it is now, therefore, only
necessary for us to consider the liability incurred in such
cases by a party becoming a shareholder.
A distinction must be drawn between the terms sub
scriber and shareholder. A subscriber, according to the
definition given in the 7 & 8 Vic. c. 110, s. 3, means any
person who has agreed to take shares in a company, but
has not executed the deeds; whilst, on the other hand, a
shareholder means a person possessed of a share, and who
has executed the deeds. The following remarks will be
confined exclusively to the latter class. A subscriber who
has executed the deeds, and thereby become a shareholder,
is (as we have already remarked), in respect of the mem
bers of the company, to all intents and purposes a part
ner (b) in the undertaking; and, as such, is liable in
solido (c) to third parties for all expenses incurred in car
rying out the objects mentioned in the deed, and for the
accomplishment of which the company was formed. He
will not, however, be held liable on any contracts made by
the directors which are foreign to the purposes of the
company.
Thus if a company is formed for making a railway from

When and how

A to B, a shareholder would not be liable for expenses in
curred in making surveys and taking preliminary steps for
a railway from A to C, and although in the subscribers’
contract and agreement great latitude is generally given to
the committee of management as to abandoning, altering,
or varying any portion of the intended line, and throwing
out branches, yet the exercise of such powers must be
limited by the original scheme of the company, and be in
accordance with the general plan and primary object of the
association. The terms of the prospectus, if conditional,
must be complied with, or no partnership is established by
the execution of the deeds. (a)
As we have before observed, the mere application for
shares and payment of deposit is not conclusive of a per
son’s liability to third parties, and amounts to nothing in
the absence of proof of other facts, such as interfering in
the management, or expressly or impliedly authorising the
particular contract on which liability is attempted to be
enforced; but the signing the deed is conclusive evidence
of a complete partnership. A subscriber to the intended
company who has not signed the deed, nor at all interfered
in the management of its affairs, is not directly liable for
expenses incurred in advertising, holding meetings, making
surveys, preparing plans and specifications, and taking
other preliminary steps for the purpose of launching the
company. In such cases the liability is cast upon the
parties to whom credit was given. To follow the words of
Mr. Baron Parke: “The secretary, or other person who
gives the order to the tradesman is primarily liable; the

CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY.
But if a subscriber has made himself a partner either by
interfering in the management of the concern, or by sign
ing the deed, he will be directly liable.
It is but seldom that a subscriber in a railway company
has the opportunity of interfering in the management of it,
that being left entirely in the hands of a select number;
attending and voting at meetings is, however, a sufficient
interference to involve the liabilities under considera
tion. (a)
On signing the deeds the party executing becomes a
partner from the time when he paid his deposit, (b) con
sequently he incurs a liability not only on contracts
entered into subsequent to the execution of the deeds,
but also on those which, though previous to such execu
tion, were subsequent to the payment of his deposit. But
he will not be liable for the price of goods ordered by a
company before he had become a member, but not deli
vered until afterwards. (c)
However, since the Joint Stock Companies’ Registra
tion Act, the liabilities of shareholders in companies for
executing works requiring the authority of parliament is
much restricted, and may be said to be confined exclu
sively to such preliminary expenses as may have been
incurred in taking the necessary steps for procuring an
act of parliament.
All other contracts for services, or execution of works
at a future day, or purchasing of lands, must be made
conditional on the company obtaining their act of incor
poration. Should any contracts in breach of this provi
sion be made unconditionally, the parties contracting may
possibly incur a personal liability in respect thereof, but

no such liability can attach to the general body of the
shareholders.
In railway companies the liability of shareholders seldom
becomes a question of practical importance, as creditors of
the company rarely proceed against a shareholder, because
they possess a more extensive and more easily available
remedy by action against some or all the members of the
committee of management, into whose hands the deposits
are paid, and to which fund every creditor will resort so
long as it lasts. Should the funds be exhausted, it is,
even in such cases, better to sue the managing committee,
(or some member of it) they having generally the power,
by action upon their covenants in the deed of settlement,
to compel the shareholders to contribute rateably towards
the expenses incurred.
Having thus shown the liability of a shareholder to
third parties after he has signed the deeds, it is necessary
to make a few remarks on a clause frequently inserted
in prospectuses, “That the shareholder is not to be
liable beyond the amount of his or her deposit.” As
regards third parties such a clause is entirely nugatory.(a)
Into the prospectuses of bond fide companies it ought
never to be introduced, as its object (or at least its only
effect) must be to mislead the ignorant and unwary, with
the hopes of a limited liability when the law imposes an
unlimited. Nevertheless such a clause may, perhaps,
create a contract between the shareholders and the
promoters, in which case the latter would be liable to
return any sum paid by the former to a creditor of the
company, beyond the amount of deposit specified in the
prospectus.
After a shareholder has signed the deed, he cannot be
released from his responsibilities and duties as such except
on performance of all the covenants he has entered into,
or with the consent of his associates. Thus it was held in

Kidwelly Canal Company v. Raby,(a) thatthe defendant who
had subscribed an agreement for the purpose of obtaining
an act of parliament to execute certain works, &c., could
not withdraw his name, and discharge himself from his
engagement, without the consent of the rest of the sub
scribers, nor when the act was obtained could he exonerate
himself from the liability imposed thereby, by showing
that he had, during the progress of the bill, renounced
before the committee all further connexion with the un
dertaking, and procured the omission of his name from
the act. In that case a doubt was thrown out, whether
the directors had even the power of releasing him.
Where a shareholder is released by consent of his part

entered into subsequent to his withdrawal; his respon

though not completed at the time, will remain entirely
unaffected.
sec. v.-Sale of Scrip.
WE come now to consider the legality of the sale of
scrip, and shall inquire first, if the sale of scrip is good at
common law independently of the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110.
On referring to the decisions that were given previously
to the repeal of the 6 Geo. 1. c. 18. (known as the Bubble
Act,) we find, in general, that the sale of scrip certificates
was held illegal, and that none of the parties concerned,
whether principals or brokers, could recover upon or en
force a contract entered into for this purpose; and, that
it made no difference whether the transaction amounted
to an actual sale, or only to an agreement for a sale, of
the documents in question.
Thus, in osephs v. Pebrer, (b) it was held, that a broker

could not maintain an action against his principal for the
price of certain shares purchased at the request of the
latter, as the contract was in violation of the above
statute. Again, in another case,(a) in which B. being
employed by A. to purchase for him transferable shares in
an unincorporated company, charged and received from
him a sum of money beyond the market price of such
shares at the time, it was held that an action would not
lie to recover back the overcharge, the company being
within 6 G. l. c. 18, and the parties in pari delicto.
The general test of the legality of such companies was
the issuing or not of shares transferable without re
striction, and it was assumed in Josephs v. Pebrer, above
cited, that an association issuing transferable shares, and
assuming to act as a body corporate, in anticipation of
obtaining an act of parliament, was illegal as well at com
mon law as under the statute, and that no agreement
relative to the sale or purchase of shares in a proposed
joint stock company, to authorise which no act of par
liament had been passed or charter granted, could be
enforced.
On the repeal of the 6 Geo. 1, c. 18 by the 6 Geo. 4,
c. 91, all companies within the 18th, 19th, and 20th sec
tions of the 6 Geo. 1, cap. 18, in respect of which the
statutory restrictions and penalties were removed, were in
future “to be dealt with and adjudged upon in like manner
as they might have been at common law.”
In a later case (b), decided after the repeal of the Bubble
Act, although the question before the court was not as to
the validity of an agreement for the sale or purchase of
shares in an unincorporated company, yet the legality of
the purchase of such shares was debated and decided. An
action had been brought by the purchaser against the
vendor of scrip certificates in a company for forming a

railway (and which was dissolved because no eligible line
could be found) for the recovery of the money paid, on the
ground of the failure of consideration. The defence set
up was that the whole transaction was illegal, and that the
parties being in pari delicto, the plaintiff could not recover.
That objection was however overruled, and, in fact, the
legality of the sale of scrip certificates admitted. We next
come to a class of cases in which the legality of the sale of
scrip certificates, although not directly in question, seems
to have been again acknowledged by the court. The first
is that of the London Grand Junction Railway Company
v. Freeman (a), in which the defendant was sued for calls
as the registered proprietor of shares in the above com
pany; it appeared, on the trial, that the defendant was
the purchaser of scrip certificates from an original sub
scriber, and on the passing of the act had sent in the scrip
certificates so purchased claiming to be registered, and was
accordingly registered; subsequent to registration he had
taken no further steps, and never called for his shares nor
executed any transfer of them according to the provisions
of the act. On the part of the defendant it was contended
that the sale of the scrip certificates was illegal, and that
the original subscriber was the only party responsible in
respect of those shares. Lord Denman, in his judgment,
alluding to the defence set up, as to the illegality of the
transfer of scrip, says, “The transfers thus made were said
to be illegal according to the doctrine laid down by Lord
Tenterden in Josephs v. Pebrer (b), and to the cases of
Duvergier v. Fellows (c), and Blundell v. Winsor (d). We
may observe that that doctrine was not necessary for the
decision of the first mentioned case then before the court,
nor will it be necessary for us now to investigate its sound
ness on general principles, or decide on the extent of its

application, if it shall turn out that parliament, in the act
for forming this company, has in fact given its sanction to
the transfer of shares which had actually taken place at
that time. The other two cases fall extremely short of
Josephs v. Pebrer.” His lordship goes on further to state
that it was proved in evidence that original subscribers,
who had paid their deposit, received a banker’s receipt
for the money, and obtained scrip certificates in exchange
for it, and that such certificates were commonly sold to the
amount of many thousands, and that while this course of
dealing notoriously prevailed, the company obtained their
act, in one of the clauses of which (that regulating and
enforcing the payment of calls) terms were employed
which evidently contemplated that there might be at that
time others besides original subscribers who were entitled
to shares, (a) whence it was clearly to be inferred that
the sale and transfer of scrip was recognised, and there
fore the validity of it admitted by the legislature.
In another case (the converse of the last) (b) the pur
chaser of scrip certificates claimed to be registered as pro
prietor of shares, and it appeared that a number of scrip
certificates had been fraudulently issued by the secretary,
previous to the incorporation of the company, and the
defence was that the register was already full. The
legality of the sale of the scrip certificates did not come
directly into question, yet it seems to have been admitted.
Mr. Baron Parke says, “The plaintiff must show that he
was entitled as assignee of an original subscriber, that there
was great doubt as to whether he could show by merely
producing the scrip certificates that he was entitled to be
registered, and that the plaintiff would act wisely by
deducing a title from the original subscriber, if he did
that he would probably succeed, if he did not he would,
probably, be defeated.”
The courts of common law have, therefore, so far recog
(a) See also 8 Vic, c. 16, s. 8.

CHAP. 11.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 71
nised this mode of dealing with scrip certificates as, in .
one case, to allow a railway company after obtaining their
act to sue a party for calls who had been a purchaser of
such scrip certificates previous to their incorporation,
although he had only sent in the certificates for registra
tion, had preferred no claim to the shares, nor taken any
further steps to render himself liable as a shareholder. (a)
In the other case a purchaser of scrip certificates was
held entitled to have his shares registered on the passing
of the act provided, he could deduce a good title from an
original subscriber. Hence we may infer that if the pur
pose for which the company was formed was not likely to
be injurious to the public, (b) and not, therefore, a vio
lation of the common law, that the purchase and sale of
scrip certificates in railway companies previous to incor
poration, like the purchase and sale of other choses in
action, is not illegal, and that although there is no pri
vity of contract between the purchaser and the com
pany, so as to make the purchaser a partner in the un
dertaking in the place of the seller, still the seller may,
nevertheless, give the purchaser such an interest there
in (c) as that an agreement for the sale or purchase
thereof may be enforced by an action or other legal
remedy, in which case the measure of damages would be
the difference between the value of the shares on the day
appointed for the completion of the contract, and the day
on which they were bought in or sold out (as the case
may be), by the plaintiff in consequence of the defendant’s
default, such latter day being within a reasonable time
after the contract was broken.(d)

72 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book I.
Legality of
under 7 & 8
Vict. c. 110.
We now come to consider whether the transfer of scrip
certificates in railway companies established since the
first of November, 1844, is at all affected by the 7 & 8
Vict, c. 110. On turning to the second section of that
act we find it provided, that the act shall not apply to any
company for executing any work requiring the authority
of parliament, except as thereinafter specially provided.
The 26th section which imposes restrictions, and pre
scribes certain formalities on the transfer and sale of
shares, enacts, that until a joint stock company shall have
obtained a certificate of complete registration, and until a
subscriber shall have been duly registered as a share
holder in the Registry Office, it shall not be lawful for
such subscriber to dispose by sale or mortgage of such
share, or of any interest therein, and that every contract for
the sale or disposal of such share or interest shall be void,
and that every person entering into such contract shall
forfeit a sum not exceeding “Ten Pounds.” No mention
whatever is made in that section of railway or other com
panies requiring the authority of parliament, nor can we
infer from the general construction of the section that it
was intended to include such companies. In fact, many
of its provisions, especially those specifying how and when
a shareholder would become entitled to receive the divi
dends and profits arising from the concern, are entirely
inapplicable to railway companies.
Moreover, the statute itself being highly penal must
be construed with strictness, and no effect be given to its
prohibitory and penal clauses beyond what the terms of
them absolutely require. Hence, from these considera
tions we may safely infer, that whatever might have been
the intention of the legislature with regard to Railway
companies in framing the section under consideration,
such intention has not been so expressed as to bring them
within its meaning and operation, and that, therefore, the
sale of scrip certificates in railway companies still remains
on the same footing as it did previous to the passing
of the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 73
Since the above remarks were written, the question of
the legality of the sale of scrip has come before the
Court of Exchequer in the case of Young v. Smith, (a) in
which it was decided, that the 26th section of the 7 & 8
Vict. c. 110, did not render void the sale of shares of a
railway company commenced after the passing of that act,
and requiring an act of parliament for the execution of
the railway; such companies not being specially included
in that section within the meaning of the words in the
second section, “except as hereinafter specially pro
vided.” (a)
The sale or purchase of scrip certificates is generally
effected through a broker, who delivers a note to his prin
cipal, containing an account of the purchase or sale of
the same, with the price at which they are bought or
sold, together with the names of the contracting parties.
It is incumbent on brokers concerned in the sale or
purchase of scrip shares to name their respective princi
pals, as if the name of his principal be not stated, the
broker may become liable personally to the other contract
ing party for the completion of the contract.(b) Brokers
will, in such cases, however, only be liable to such other
parties or their brokers, and not to their own principals,
should the contract be broken by the default of the other
parties. A person employing a broker to sell shares can
not sue him for the value of the shares under the common
counts for money had and received, unless it appear that
he has actually received payment for them; but he must
declare against him specially for negligence, as for selling
to an improper person, or for selling on credit, when the
(a) L. J., N. S. 15, Ex. 81; 15 M. & W., 121. Since the decision of the
Court of Exchequer in Young, v. Smith, a series of cases involving the same
question have been determined by the Court of Queen's Bench in conformity
therewith. See Lawton v. Hickman, Loonie v. Oldfield, Fisher v. Aide,
O'Neil v. Brendle, Ray v. Hirst, T. T. 1846. 16 L. J. N. S. 20. 2 B.
(b) As to liability of agent, when the principal is not disclosed, see Paley

terms were for cash. If the broker retain the shares,
never having parted with them, trover would lie to recover
them. In the city of London a broker refusing or neg
lecting to name his principal, is liable to have the bond
given, on his admission to the Stock exchange, put in
suit, and to be prevented from acting, as a broker,
within the city, for the future. Brokers are bound to
comply exactly with the orders given, and will be held
responsible for any mistake they may make in acting upon
them. Thus an order to buy scrip will not be satisfied by
the purchase of scrip which turns out not to be genuine (a),
or by the purchase of a letter of allotment if there are
scrip in the market. But where the order was to pur
chase shares, and it appeared that there were none in the
market, but that it was the practice of the Stock Exchange
to buy and sell letters of allotment in that railway as
shares, the broker was held entitled to recover their value
and his commission, if the jury should be of opinion that the
order was to buy what was sold in the market as shares (b).
It has been held that those bought and sold notes
require a stamp, being agreements within the provisions
of the stamp act, and not within the exemptions as
to agreements relating to the sale of any goods, wares,
and merchandise (c), although in an action by a principal
against his broker for money had and received, when the
broker had purchased a number of shares for the plaintiff,
and represented that at the time of the purchase eight
pounds per share had been already paid, when in fact only
five pounds had been paid, it was held that the bought
and sold note could be received in evidence, although
unstamped (d). The distinction, however, is easy to be
seen: in the case of Knight v. Barber, the bought and

sold note would have to be put in evidence as a memo
randum of an agreement between party and party, whilst
in the latter it would not be used as evidence of any con
tract, but merely as evidence that the broker had been
employed in a particular transaction. The amount of
the stamp required on a bought and sold note is two
shillings and sixpence; it is not, however, necessary that
the instrument should be stamped at the time of the con
tract, whether the transaction is immediate or for the next
account day, such account days happening every fortnight,
and the stamp act permitting any memorandum or agree
ment to be stamped within fourteen days after the
agreement shall have been made, without the payment of
any penalty (a). Consequently, except in cases of con
tracts to be fulfilled at a future day, beyond the account
days, it will be almost always sufficient to stamp the agree
ment, on the failure of the other party to complete his part
of the contract. Moreover, in the London Stock Exchange,
the brokers of each party, being considered primarily liable
for their principals, it is seldom or never that one principal
brings his action against the other for not performing his
part of the contract; and in any action by a principal
against his broker, arising out of such transactions, the
note would be admissible as evidence of the transaction
without a stamp (b).
Although, if the agreement for the sale or purchase
of scrip shares is in writing, the agreement must be
stamped, it is by no means necessary that the agreement
should be in writing, a mere parol agreement being suf
ficient, as neither scrip, shares, nor stock, are goods, wares,
or merchandise, within the meaning of the seventeenth
section of the statute of frauds (c), nor an interest in land

within the fourth section of that statute (a). In case
either party refuse or neglect to complete his part of the
contract, it is usual for the broker of the other party who
is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, to
sell out or buy in, against the party making default, and
debit such party or his broker with any loss arising on the
transaction, that is with the difference between the price
agreed on, and the actual price at the time of default,
allowing a reasonable time for the sale or purchase of other
shares (b). But previous to buying in or selling out
against a defaulter, it is incumbent on the party ready to
perform his contract, if he be the seller of scrip, to make a
tender thereof to the other party; or if he be the purchaser,
to avow his readiness to accept and pay the money. If
the broker of the defaulting party has been compelled, by
the custom of his own Stock Exchange, to pay the differ
ence; he will be entitled to recover the amount against
his principal in assumpsit for money paid; as a person
who employs a broker on the Stock Exchange impliedly
gives him authority to act in accordance with the rules
there established, though such principal may himself be
ignorant of them (c).

CHAP. II.] FoRMATION of THE comPANY.
In the case of Daly v. Thompson, (a) however, the obser
vations of Mr. Baron Parke upon this point would lead to
the inference, that a scrip holder had such a right. In that
case the plaintiff, the purchaser of scrip shares in a com
pany called “The Anti-Dry-rot Company,” and which had
obtained an act of incorporation, brought an action against
the secretary of the company for refusing to register him
as a shareholder after act obtained. The plaintiff how
ever was nonsuited because the register was full, and the
defendants had no power to add to the number of shares.
It appeared that fictitious shares had been fraudulently
issued by a former employee of the company. On motion
for a rule to set aside the nonsuit and obtain a new trial,
Mr. Baron Parke on granting the rule, observed, that the
plaintiff must show that he was entitled as assignee of an
original subscriber; and there is a serious question, whether
he could show that merely by production of the scrip cer
tificate. A purchaser of scrip, however, is not impliedly
bound, in the absence of any special contract to that effect
with the vendor, to accept a legal transfer of the shares
when the act of incorporation is procured, nor to indemnify
the vendor against his liability to the company for future
calls upon them.(b) But if the purchaser of scrip certifi
cates do any thing after the act has been obtained acknow
ledging himself as the owner of shares, he will become
liable to future calls, although he may not have become a
proprietor according to the mode of transfer prescribed by
the act. Thus where the purchaser of scrip certificates, in
pursuance of notice by the company, sent in his scrip with
a claim to be registered as a proprietor in respect thereof,
and received from the company a receipt for the scrip cer
tificates, with a notice that they could be exchanged for
sealed certificates on demand, and they were registered

ccordingly; it was held, that he was liable as a proprietor
of those shares, although he never applied for or received
such sealed certificates, nor was any regular transfer made
to him as prescribed by the act. (a) Should the project be
abandoned previously to any steps being taken to obtain
an act of parliament, it has been decided that the purchaser
of scrip would be entitled to call on his vendor to repay
him the purchase money, on the ground of a failure of
consideration; and this without even tendering back the
scrip certificates. The justice of this decision may fairly
be questioned. It is obvious that the buyer purchases
only the expectancy which the seller himself had, and that
the amount of consideration is less than it would have been
if the contingency had then been determined by the ob
taining of the act. (b) That the contingency is ultimately
determined unfavourably for the buyer, is surely no suffi
cient reason for avoiding a contract entered into with a full
knowledge of all the circumstances. Or if this point were
conceded, it is clearly a violation of our ordinary notions
of fairness, that the purchase money should be recovered
back while there is no restoration of the thing purchased.
The vendor loses all control over his scrip certificates
on parting with the possession of them to a purchaser,
yet (as we have just seen) he has no right of indemnity (c)
against the future calls, in the absence of any express
agreement to that effect, nor can he compel the buyer to
register the shares. Therefore, where a vendor of scrip is
desirous of getting rid of all future liability, he should
make it part of the condition of the contract, that the
purchaser indemnify him against all future calls in respect

shares, after the act has been obtained, if so required by
the vendor. On the passing of the act, the vendor, if an
original subscriber, (a) may be compelled to register his
shares and pay up all the calls, if the purchaser neglect or
refuse so to do.
A question of considerable importance arises on this
point: whether an original shareholder, having been com
pelled to register the shares and pay up the calls owing to
the default of the purchaser, becomes absolutely entitled
to such shares as against the purchaser, or whether the
latter, on payment of all the back calls and interest, would
be entitled, as against the original shareholder, to have
such shares transferred to him in the manner prescribed
by the Railway Companies’ Clauses Act, 8 Vict, c. 16,
or to have the original purchase money returned; and
whether such purchaser would be entitled to any, and
what remedy, either at common law or in equity. With
regard to any remedy at common law, it is difficult to see
how an action could be maintained either for damages for
not delivering shares in the place of scrip, or for a return
of the purchase money on the ground of a failure of con
sideration: as to the first case, reasoning by analogy to
the cases in which it has been held that there is no im
plied undertaking on the part of a purchaser of scrip to
indemnify the seller against liability for future calls (b), it
would seem that there can be no such undertaking on the
part of the seller to deliver, after the act has been ob
tained, the shares which give the legal right to the stock.
As to the return of the purchase money for failure of con
sideration, the failure would have entirely arisen through
the parties’ own default (c). With regard, however,
to any remedy in equity, it is submitted that, should
the purchaser not have been guilty of any laches, and
have been unable to get his shares registered owing to the
company refusing to accept him as a shareholder; a court

of equity would decree a specific performance, compelling
the original allottee to register the shares, and then trans
fer them to the purchaser in the manner prescribed by
the act ; (a) it having been held that a bill will lie in
equity for the specific performance of a contract for the
purchase of stock, where it prays for the delivery of scrip
certificates which give the legal title to the stock (b).
But the case is very different where the holder, by
keeping back whilst the contract is disadvantageous, neg
lects to avail himself of the power he had of converting
such scrip into registered shares, and by such conduct
burthens the original allottee with liability on his cove
nants in the subscribers’ agreement; and then, on the
shares rising in value, claims to be admitted to all the
advantages arising from them. The lapse of time would
be a sufficient bar to any equitable right; time being the
essence of a contract where the subject of the contract is
of such a nature as to be exposed to a daily variation in
its value (c).
From the above general remarks we may infer, in the
first place, that a scrip-holder would not be entitled to
have the shares transferred to him, on payment of calls
and interest to the original subscriber, who had been,
through his default, compelled to register; and in the
second place, that he would not be entitled to have the
original purchase-money returned, as being money re
tained by the vendor, without consideration; for that
money was paid for the option which the scrip receipts
gave the purchaser to become the registered owner of the
shares on condition of sending in his scrip on or before
the day named; and, lastly, that the company having,
under such circumstances, elected to register an original
subscriber, will be bound to give him certificates of his
shares without requiring the production of the scrip.

SEC. VII.—Complete Registration.
IT is obvious, from many parts of the 7 & 8 Vict. c. 110,
that the statute applies to railway companies, as well in the
sections relating to complete registration, as in those re
lating to provisional registration, although the former is
not made imperative on such companies. It may be a
matter of more doubt as to how far a railway company is
benefited by being completely registered. On turning to
the 7th section of the Joint Stock Companies’ Act, which
expressly applies to every joint stock company, whether
for executing any work under the sanction of the legis
lature, or for any other purpose (a), it appears, “That it
shall not be lawful for any company, whether for executing
any such work under the authority of Parliament, or for
any other purpose, to act otherwise than provisionally in
accordance with this act, until such company shall have
obtained a certificate of complete registration.”
The section then goes on to enumerate the requisites for
obtaining a certificate of complete registration, which, at
first sight, would seem to be exclusively applicable to com
panies not requiring the authority of Parliament for the
execution of their works; more especially as the 9th section
expressly prescribes certain other preliminaries to the
complete registration of railway companies, in respect of
which it is enacted, “That if any company for executing
any work which cannot be carried into execution without
the authority of Parliament deposit at the proper offices
of the two Houses of Parliament, in compliance with the
standing orders of such Houses respectively, and at and
within the time required by such standing orders, such
deeds of partnership, or subscription contracts, as shall be
required to be deposited by such standing orders, and also

return to the said Registry Office, a copy of such deeds of
partnership, or subscription contracts, together with such
certificate of the receipt of such plans, sections, and books
of reference, as shall be appointed by the committee of
Privy Council for Trade, thereupon such company shall
be entitled to a certificate of complete registration.” (a)
We shall specify more minutely, hereinafter, the docu
ments which must be deposited as above, together with
the times and places of deposit, and such other particulars
as may be necessary to furnish a safe and sufficient guide
to those whose duty it may be to manage this part of a
company’s affairs. Meanwhile, it is only necessary here
to remark, that the returns required by the above section
must be made by the promoters of the company, or some
or one of them, unless they have appointed a solicitor to
make them on behalf of the company.
These returns must be made within a year from the
date of the certificate of provisional registration, unless in
the mean time the company have been incorporated by
Act of Parliament, or have applied to renew the certifi
cate of provisional registration, which is of force only for
twelve calendar months from the date thereof.
On the receipt of the requisite documents the registrar
of joint stock companies will grant a certificate of com
plete registration, on which a fee of five pounds is payable
by the company, with one shilling additional in respect of
every thousand pounds value of capital, as declared in the
formation of the company in the deed of settlement, or by
any other special authority (b). It is afterwards provided,
however, “That if within two years after a company shall
have obtained a certificate of complete registration such
company shall obtain an act for the incorporation thereof,
then three-fourths of the fee paid by, or on behalf of, such
company on such complete registration, in respect of the
capital of the company, shall be reimbursed and repaid to
(a) Id. s. 9. (b) Id. s. 21.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 83
the said company, and that it shall be lawful for the said
commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, and they are
hereby authorised and empowered, to repay the same
accordingly.”(a) In the case of a railway company, there
fore, this proportion of the sum paid on complete registra
tion would be returned to the company, if the act should
be obtained within the specified period.
It is quite clear from the above, that the act contem
plates the complete registration of railway companies,
although there is nothing contained therein making it
compulsory on them to take such a step. We must now
consider whether complete registration is of any and what
service to a railway company.
On examining the 23d section of the act we find, in
the case of companies whose works cannot be carried into
execution without the authority of parliament, that on
provisional registration, it is lawful for them to assume
the name of the intended company, to open subscription
lists, and receive deposits after the rate of ten shillings on
every hundred pounds of the capital of the company, to
gether with such sum as may be required by the standing
orders of either House of Parliament; but not to make
calls, nor to purchase or contract for or hold lands,
or enter into any contracts, &c., unless conditionally,
except contracts for services in making surveys, and per
forming all other acts necessary for obtaining an act for
enabling the company to execute the works. Hence it ap
pears, that all that a railway company, provisionally regis
tered, can do unconditionally is to allot shares, receive
deposits, and contract for surveys, and take other preli
minary steps towards securing legislative sanction.
The 25th section, after enumerating the privileges of
joint-stock companies completely registered, ends with the
following proviso:—“Provided always with regard to any
company for executing works that cannot be carried into

execution without the authority of parliament, that on
the complete registration of such company, and before ob
taining the act of parliament, it shall not be lawful for any
such company to exercise the heretofore mentioned powers
to enter into contracts, otherwise than conditionally
upon obtaining such act; nor to exercise the power to
purchase and hold lands as aforesaid; nor to exercise the
power to receive instalments from shareholders, beyond
the sum necessary to be deposited in compliance with the
standing orders of either House of Parliament, or such
other sum as may be requisite for obtaining the authority
of parliament; nor to exercise the power of borrowing
money, or declaring dividends; but, subject to the last
mentioned exceptions, all the powers by this enactment
given to any company completely registered, except the
general power to perform all acts necessary for carrying
on the business of the company, may be exercised as fully
by any such company so completely registered as by any
other company so completely registered.”
The same section then proceeds, “Provided always that
it shall be lawful for any such company to perform all acts
which may be necessary for obtaining an act of incorpo
ration, or other act for obtaining the authority of par
liament;” and it then proceeds to state, that upon obtain
ing the act, all the powers given under the Joint Stock
Companies’ Act shall cease. What, therefore, are railway
companies, completely registered, empowered to do?
They may use the name of the company, adding thereto,
Registered.
They may have a common seal.
They may sue and be sued in their registered name.
They may sue in respect of any claim by the company,

not. -

They may issue certificates of shares.
They may hold general meetings periodically, and ex
traordinary meetings upon being duly summoned.
They may from time to time, at some general meeting,
make bye-laws, if they are not inconsistent with the sub
scribers’ deed.
And appoint directors to manage, &c.
In addition to the above powers, they may make con
tracts for purchase of lands and for carrying on works,
conditional on obtaining their act; and in case the depo
sits originally paid are insufficient to meet the expenses
of obtaining the act, they may compel the subscribers to
pay such further sum as may be required for that purpose.
From the perusal of the above, it would appear that the
most important of the powers acquired on complete regis
tration, is that of suing and being sued in the registered
name of the company, under which it is clear the company
would be entitled not merely to sue the allottees who had
neglected to take up their shares, but also third parties in
respect of causes of action arising out of any breach of
contract with the company, without incurring the danger
of having the action released by any of the shareholders
(a). Moreover, all actions must, in the first instance, be
brought against the company in their registered name, as
the only remedy against individual members, is by scire
facias, should the effects of the company be found insuf
ficient to satisfy the judgment. If the mode prescribed in
the 7 & 8 Vic. c. 110, s. 9., be the only one by which a
railway company can obtain a certificate of complete regis
tration, the advantages secured by such a step would be
but for a very limited period, should the company obtain
their act of incorporation on their first application to par
liament; as all the powers given on complete registration
cease, and determine on the passing ofthat act. In this case,
therefore, the certificate of complete registration would only
(a) Rawsthorne v. Gandell, 15 L. J. N. S. Exch. 291, 15. M. & W. 304,
86 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book I.
be of force between the periods of depositing the plans and
subscription contract, and of obtaining the act. But
should the bill be rejected, and the company be desirous
of proceeding in a future session of parliament, complete
registration will be probably of great importance, as
enabling the company to sue both their own members and
third parties, with greater facility than they could whilst
only registered provisionally. -
It is not, however, altogether clear, that the only mode
by which a railway, or other company requiring the autho
rity of parliament, can obtain a certificate of complete
registration, is by depositing plans and subscription con
tracts at the proper offices in compliance with the standing
orders of either House of Parliament, as prescribed in the
ninth section of the above statute. A careful investigation
of that and the seventh section, will rather lead to the
inference that such companies can obtain their certificate
of complete registration by compliance either with the
seventh or ninth sections. The seventh section states that
it shall not be lawful for any joint stock company, for any
purpose within the meaning of the act, whether for exe
cuting any work under the authority of parliament, or for
any other purpose, to act otherwise than provisionally, in
accordance with the act, until they shall have obtained a
certificate of complete registration, as thereinafter pro
vided; and that no joint stock company shall be entitled
to receive a certificate of complete registration, unless it be
formed by some deed or writing under the hands and seals
of shareholders; the section then proceeds to state what
the deed must contain, and ‘that every such deed of settle
ment must be signed by at least one-fourth in number of
the persons, who, at the date of the deed, have become
subscribers, and who shall hold at least one-fourth
of the maximum number of shares in the capital of the
company.” The words of the above section are clearly
large enough to include railway companies, notwithstand
ing the proviso in the second section, which exempts rail
cHAP. 11.] FoRMATION of THE comPANY. 87
way companies from the operation of the act except when
specially provided for ; and, were it not for the 9th
section, would point out the only mode by which such
companies could obtain a certificate of complete registra
tion. The 9th section, however, proceeds to state, that
if any companies requiring the authority of Parliament
deposit at the proper offices of the two Houses of Parlia
ment, in compliance with the standing orders of such
Houses respectively, and at or within the time required
by such standing orders, such deeds of partnership or
subscription-contracts as shall be required to be deposited
by such standing orders; and also return to the said
registry-office a copy of such deeds of partnership or
subscription-contracts, together with such certificates of
the receipt of such plans, sections, and books of reference
as shall be appointed by the said committee of Privy
Council for Trade: then it shall be lawful for the registrar
of joint stock companies, and he is hereby required, to
accept the same instead of the deed of settlement required
by the 7th section. The words of that section, requiring
the registrar to receive, but not requiring the members of
the company to register certain particulars in the place of
those prescribed in the 7th section, necessarily lead to the
inference that a railway company can obtain a certificate
of complete registration under the provisions of either sec
tion, and that in case the company, either by the negligence
of their engineers or surveyors in preparing the proper
plans, or by the default of the subscribers in not paying
up their deposits and executing the usual deeds, should be
unable to deposit their plans and subscription-contracts,
in compliance with standing orders, yet still, if not less
than a fourth in number of subscribers, owning not less
than one-fourth of the capital, execute a deed in com
pliance with the requirements of the 7th section, they
would be entitled to a certificate of complete registration.

directors of railway companies have sometimes found them

selves placed, by being harassed with numerous actions at
the suit of creditors, and being unable to compel the sub
scribers to contribute towards the payment of preliminary
expenses, or pay the deposit upon the shares allotted to
them, when, from any cause whatever, they have been
prevented from going to Parliament, or defeated in their
application, has induced us to draw attention to the mode
and advantages of complete registration, even in cases of
companies requiring the sanction of the legislature for the
accomplishment of their purposes.

PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS RENDERED NECESSARY BY THE

IN the present book we shall detail all the steps necessary
to be taken for obtaining a Railway Act: hence it will in
clude all needful directions for providing and depositing
the requisite plans and documents, in compliance with the
standing orders of the Houses of Parliament, giving all
the notices to the public and to parties interested, prepar
ing estimates and paying deposit, introducing and carrying
through both houses the railway bill, with the formalities
to be observed in all the stages of the measure; together
with such other particulars preliminary to, and attendant
upon the parliamentary proceedings on a railway bill, as
may suffice for the guidance of those whose duty it is to
prepare for and to conduct those proceedings.
SEC. I.—The Parliamentary Agent.

the steps hereinafter mentioned must be taken through the
intervention of a parliamentary agent.

before one of the clerks in the Private Bill Office, engaging
to pay all fees and charges which may be demanded, and
to observe the rules and regulations of the House. It is
usual also to enter into recognizance, in the sum of £500,
for the due performance of this undertaking. He is then
registered in a book kept in the Private Bill Office, and will
be entitled to act as a parliamentary agent without the
payment of any fee, upon the declaration, bond, or registry.
No notice can be received at the Private Bill Office, of
any proceeding relating to a bill, until an appearance has
been entered of some one who shall act as the parlia
mentary agent for the bill, nor until the same shall be
entered in the Private Bill Office, in which shall also be
specified the name of the solicitor (if any) for such petition
or bill (a). A similar requirement is made in the case of
any petition against a bill, with this additional clause that
the name of the counsel (if any retained) who appears in
support of such petition must be specified in the appear
ance, and a certificate thereof, to be delivered to the agent,
must be produced to the committee clerk. When any
change of agent takes place, fresh appearances must be
entered.
Should any agent misconduct himself, or act in violation
of the rules of parliament, the speaker can prohibit him
from practising during his pleasure, provided that, upon
the application of the agent, the speaker state in writing
the grounds of such prohibition (b).
The name, description, and place of residence of the
parliamentary agent in town, and of the agent in the

WHENEvER application is intended to be made to Parlia

making, maintaining, varying, extending, or enlarging
any aqueduct, archway, bridge, canal, cut, dock, ferry,
harbour, navigation port, pier, railway, reservoir, tunnel,
turnpike road, or waterwork, notices must be published in
three successive weeks in the months of October and No
vember, or either of them, immediately preceding the ses

either in the London, Edinburgh, or Dublin Gazette, as
the case may be, and in some one and the same newspaper
of the county in which the city, town, or lands, to which
such bill relates shall be situate, or if there be no news

county adjoining thereto (b)
From this order it appears, first, that the notice must
be published in three consecutive weeks, in either of the
months of October or November, in the Gazette, and also
in some public journal published in every county through
which the railway is intended to pass; secondly, that pro
vided it is inserted in the Gazette once in each of those
three weeks, it is not necessary to insert it in every Ga

The notice must contain the names of the parishes,
townships, townlands, and extra parochial places, from,
in, through, or into, which the work is intended to be
made, maintained, varied, extended, or enlarged, and shall

The standing orders of the House of Lords require
also that the notice should contain a description of all
the termini, including those of the branches as well as
those of the main line. And if it be the intention
of the company to obtain power for the compulsory
purchase of lands or houses, or for extending the time
granted by any former act for that purpose, or to amal
gamate with any other company, or purchase cr lease
the undertaking of any other company, or to sell or lease
their undertaking, or to levy any tolls, rates, or duties, or
to alter any existing tolls, rates, or duties, or to confer,
vary, or extinguish, any exemptions from payment of tolls,
rates, or duties, or any other rights or privileges, the no
tices must specify such intention, and the advertisement
must be headed by a short title descriptive of the under
taking (a). In addition to the above notices, in case of
bills to empower any company already constituted by act
of parliament to execute any work other than that for
which it was originally established, the House of Lords
requires an advertisement to be inserted for four consecu
tive weeks in the newspapers of the county or counties
wherein such new works are proposed to be executed,
calling a special meeting of the proprietors of such com
pany, to submit to them a draft of the proposed bill; such
meeting to be called not earlier than seven days after the
last insertion of such advertisement (b).
Notices required to be inserted in the London, Edin
burgh, or Dublin Gazettes, must, by standing orders of
the House of Commons, be delivered at the offices of such
papers respectively at least two clear days previous to the
day of publication. Thus, if they are intended to be in
serted in the Friday evening's Gazette, they must be de
livered at the printer's on the previous Tuesday.
The 19th order declares that the printer's receipt shall
be proof of the due delivery of the notice. It would be
advisable for the solicitor or other agent delivering such

notices to take a form of receipt, to be signed by the party
into whose hands the notice is given.
With regard to the notices to be inserted in the pro
vincial papers, no time of delivery is prescribed, nor is
there any prescribed proof of such delivery, which must
be proved, therefore, by the person actually delivering the
same. Care must be taken that the notices are inserted
in three consecutive weeks.
No time for the delivery of the notices at the Gazette
office is prescribed by the orders of the House of Lords:
hence it would appear that the House of Lords absolutely
requires them to be published, and that the parties would
not be excused for non-compliance, although they had de
livered the notices in sufficient time to satisfy the orders of
the House of Commons, and the non-compliance had arisen
either from the default of the printer or from want of room
in the Gazette.
In addition to the notices required to be inserted in the
Gazette, the House of Lords requires notices, similar to
those inserted in the Gazette, to be given at the general
quarter sessions of each and every county, riding, and di
vision, in or through which the work shall be made, at
Michaelmas or Epiphany preceding the application to par
liament, by affixing such notice to the door of the sessions
house of every riding, county, or division. The above or
der does not apply to the case of railways in Scotland,
where the notices, instead of being affixed to the door of
the sessions house, must be affixed to the church doors of
all the parishes through which the line will pass, for three
successive Sundays in each of the months of October and
November preceding the application to Parliament (a).
Except in cases where notices are required to be affixed
to church doors, no notice given, or application made, on
a Sunday, or Christmas day, or before eight o’clock in the
forenoon, or after eight o’clock in the afternoon, of any
day, will be deemed valid (b). -

WHENEvER it is intended to apply to Parliament for leave
to bring in a bill by which any houses or lands are pro

any former act for that purpose is sought, an application
in writing must be made to the owners or reputed owners,
lessees or reputed lessees, and occupiers of lands or build
ings, by or over which it is proposed to construct the
works, on or before the 15th day of December immediately
preceding the session in which application for the bill is
intended to be made (a).
In the House of Lords, the notice is sufficient if deli
vered on or before the 31st (b) of December; this extended
time, however, is only of importance when the bill has
been read in the Commons, in the preceding session, and
has been permitted to take its commencement in the
Lords in the ensuing session.
The form of application to the owners, &c., of the lands
is to be found in the appendix A of standing orders of
both Houses of Parliament. The notice generally states
the intention to apply to Parliament in the ensuing
session for leave to make a railway from a certain
place to some other, and that certain property in which
the party served is believed to have an interest, will be
required for the purposes of the undertaking. It then
proceeds to state the times and places of deposit of the
plans, sections, and books of reference, and ends by re
questing the party served to give an answer in writing
expressive of assent, or dissent, or neutrality. Separate
lists must be made of such owners, lessees, and occupiers,
distinguishing which of them have assented, dissented,

to each class, distinguishing the owners from the occu
piers (b). The notice must be served both on the owners,
or reputed owners, and the lessees, or reputed lessees, and
occupiers. It may be served either by delivering the same
personally, or by leaving it at their usual place of abode,
or, in their absence from the United Kingdom, with their
agents respectively (c). In the absence of other proof,
the production of a written acknowledgment of the party
applied to, of the receipt of such application within the
given time, will be sufficient evidence of its having been
duly delivered (d).
If the act sought to be obtained is for the purpose of
relinquishing any portion of a work authorized to be made
by a former act, notice in writing of such bill must be
given to the owners, or reputed owners, and occupiers of
the lands in which the part of the said work intended to
be relinquished is situate (e).
SEC. IV.—Plans and Sections.
THE plan must describe the line or situation of the whole
work—no alternative line or work being in any case per
mitted—and the lands in and through which it is to be
made, maintained, varied, extended, or enlarged, or through
which any communication to or from the work shall be

containing the names of the owners, or reputed owners,
lessees, or reputed lessees, and occupiers, of such lands (a).
And it must be on a scale of not less than four inches to
the mile (b), and must exhibit the distances in miles and
furlongs from one of the termini; and a memorandum of
the radius of every curve, not exceeding one mile in length,
must be noted on the plan in furlongs and chains (c).
Where it is the intention of parties to apply for powers
to make any lateral deviationsfrom the line of the proposed
work, the limits of such deviation are to be defined on the
plan, and all lands included within the limits to be marked
thereon, and, except where the whole of the plan is on a
scale of not less than a quarter of an inch to one hundred
feet, an additional plan must be prepared on the scale of
not less than a quarter of an inch to every hundred
feet of any building, yard, court-yard, or land, within
the curtilage of any building, or of any ground cul
tivated as a garden, whether such lands or buildings
are on the original line or are included within the limits
of deviation (d); if tunnelling be used instead of an
open cutting, it must be marked by a dotted line on
the plan (e).
In every section of a railway, the line marked thereon
shall correspond with the upper surface of the rails in
tended to be laid (f). The scale of the section must be
drawn to the same horizontal scale as the plan, and to a
vertical scale of not less than one inch to every hundred
feet (g). -
It must show the surface of the ground marked on the
plan, the intended level of the proposed work, and also a

the whole length of the work, or of any branch thereof,
and which datum line must be referred to some fixed point
stated in writing on the section, near either of the ter
mini (a).
The datum line is generally an imaginary line a certain
number of feet above or below a fixed point, as convenience
may suggest, and carried horizontally the whole length of
the line. In an inland railway, it is generally fixed with
reference to the level of a canal; if the railway be con
structed near the sea, or any tidal river, the level of high
water at spring tides is generally taken as the point from
which it is calculated.
The distances, in miles and furlongs, must be marked
on the datum line corresponding with the plan (b).
A vertical measure must be taken from the datum line
to the line of railway, and marked, in feet and inches, at
each change of the gradient or inclination; and the pro
portion or rate of inclination in each such change must be
marked (c).
The height of the proposed railway from the upper sur
face of the rail over, or depth under, any turnpike road,
public carriage road, navigable river, canal, or railway, or
junction with a railway, and the height and span of every
arch of all bridges and viaducts, by which the railway shall
be carried over the same, must be marked in figures at
every crossing, together with the extreme height of every
embankment, and the depth of every cutting, exceeding
five feet (d). *
If the levels, or rate of inclination, of any existing turn
pike or carriage roads, or railways, be intended to be al
tered, such alteration must be marked on the section and
numbered; and cross sections, in reference to the said
numbers, on a horizontal scale of one inch to every three
hundred and thirty feet, and on a vertical scale of one inch

such alterations more clearly : that is to say, the intended
alteration of level must be stated on the section, referring
to the cross section made on the above scale, showing both
the rate of the present as well as intended inclination (a).
Where tunnelling and viaducts are substituted for cut
tings and embankments, the tunnelling must be marked
on the plan by a dotted line, and also on the section, and
the viaducts must be marked on the section (b).
The line of railway also must be delineated on a pub
lished map, of a scale not less than half an inch to a mile,
so as to show its general course and direction (c); in
parts where the ordinance survey has been completed, and
the maps published, it is usual to delineate the plan on one
of the ordinance maps, which are made on the scale of an
inch to a mile.
The plans and sections, drawn in the manner before
mentioned, and the published map with line of railway
marked thereon (d), and a duplicate of each, together with
a book of reference, must be lodged on or before the 30th
day of November preceding the session of Parliament in
which application is to be made, with the clerk of the
peace of the county, riding, or division, in England and
Ireland, or in the office of the principal sheriff's clerk of
each county in Scotland, through which the work is in
tended to be carried (e). The receipt of such plans, sec
tions, and book of reference, by the clerks of the peace or
sheriffs' clerks, as the case may be, must be acknowledged
by a memorial in writing on such plans, sections, and books
of reference, denoting the time (f) at which they were
lodged in their respective offices. One copy of the plans,
&c., is to be open for the inspection of any person at sea

By 1st Vic. c. 83, sec. 2, clerks of the peace are com
pelled to allow all persons interested to inspect and make
extracts or copies of such plans, sections, and books of re
ference, on payment of one shilling for each inspection,
one shilling for every hour after the first, and sixpence for
every one hundred words copied. And by sec. 3 of the above
act, the clerk of the peace is liable to a penalty not ex
ceeding £5 for neglecting or refusing to comply with the
above provisions.
In addition to the deposit of copies of the plans, sections,
and books of reference, with the clerk of the peace, it is
provided by a standing order of the House of Lords, 223,
sec. 11, that copies of the standing orders requiring such
deposit should be delivered to the clerk of the peace, or
sheriff's clerk, as the case may be, at the same time with
the other documents.
Similar copies of the plans, &c., together with a published
map, drawn to a scale of not less than half an inch to a mile,
with the line of railway delineated thereon, so as to show
its general course and direction, must be deposited in the

A copy of so much of the standing orders of the House
of Lords, as relates to the deposit of plans, sections, and
books of reference with the parish clerks, must be deli
vered to such parish clerk, schoolmaster, town clerk, or
clerk of the union, at the same time as the plans and

Where any of the works shall be situated on tidal lands,
within the ordinary and spring tides, a copy of the plans and
sections must be deposited at the office of the Board of
Admiralty, on or before the 30th day of November (a).
A copy of the plans, sections, &c., must be deposited in
the Private Bill Office of the House of Commons, on or be
fore the 30th day of November (b), and in the office of
the Clerk of Parliament on or before the 31st of Decem

In all cases in which deposits of plans, &c., are required
to be made, such deposits, to be valid, must be made be
tween the hours of eight o'clock in the morning and eight
o'clock at night (d).
Thus we see that copies of the plans, sections, and books
of reference, are required for every county, riding, and
corporate town, through which the line is intended to
pass: two for each clerk of the peace, and each town clerk,
which must be deposited on or before the 30th of Novem

fore the 30th of November; one for the Private Bill Office,
to be deposited on or before the 30th of November; one
for the Clerk of Parliament, to be deposited on or before
the 31st of December; one for the Board of Admiralty, if
any of the works are within high-water mark; Nand copies
of so much of the plan as relates to each parish must be
deposited with the parish clerks, &c., on or before the
30th of November.

SEC. V.—Subscription Contract and Estimate.
HAvTNG noticed, in a former chapter, the form of the sub
scription contract, we now only briefly recapitulate such
provisions therein as are required by standing orders.
An estimate of the expense of the undertaking, under
each bill, must be made and signed by the person making
the same, and a subscription must be entered into, under
a contract, to three-fourths of the amount of such esti
mate (a).
The subscription contract must contain the Christian
and surnames, description, and place of abode, of every
subscriber, his signature to the amount of his subscription,
with the amount which he has paid up, and the name of the
party witnessing the signature, and the date of the same,
respectively (b). And each subscriber must bind himself, his
executors, and administrators, for the payment of the
money subscribed by him. It must be filled up to the
extent of three-fourths of the estimate hereinafter men
tioned.
To be valid in accordance with the standing order of
the House of Lords relating to railways, the subscription
contract must be entered into subsequent to the com
mencement of the session of Parliament, previous to that
in which application is made for the bill to which it re
lates (c).
The subscription contract, as required by the standing
orders of the House of Commons, must be entered into
subsequent to the day fixed in the session of Parliament
previous to that in which application is made for leave to
bring in the bill to which it relates, as the last day on
which petitions for private bills may be presented (d).

mencement of every session.(a)
Consequently, to render the subscription contract valid
as regards both Houses of Parliament, it must be entered
into subsequent to the day appointed by the Commons as
the last day on which they will receive petitions for private
bills.
Copies of the subscription contract, and estimates, with
the names of the subscribers arranged in alphabetical or
der, and the amount of deposit paid up by the subscribers
respectively; or where a declaration and estimate are
substituted in lieu of a subscription contract, copies of
such declaration and estimate must be printed at the ex
pense of the promoters of the bill, and lodged at the Vote
Office previous to the deposit of the petition, for the use of
the members of the House (b). A copy also must be lodged
in the Private Bill Office, and the receipt thereof acknow
ledged accordingly by one of the clerks of that office upon
such copy, and also upon the petition (c).
Similar copies must be printed and delivered at the
office of the Clerk of Parliament, for the use of the mem
bers of the House of Lords, previous to the second reading
of the bill in the upper House (d).
SEC. VI.— Petition, Declaration, and Bill.
IN former sessions of Parliament the mode of introducing
a bill into the House was by petition in a particular form,
and it was only necessary that the prescribed formalities
should be complied with previous to its presentaticn. The
petition, itself, was not a preliminary document necessary
to be deposited before the meeting of Parliament in con
(a) H.C. 113. (b) H.C. 40.
(c) II.C. 139. (d) 11.L. 221, sec. 6.

pliance with any standing orders. Now, however, by the
standing orders passed in the session of 1846, the petition
and bill, and agent’s declaration, are made preliminary
documents, and required to be drawn up in the manner
directed, and deposited in certain offices on or before the
days appointed. By the same orders the committee, and
the sub-committees on petitions were abolished, and in
their place an officer called the examiner of petitions
appointed.
A petition for a bill must be in writing, as a printed
petition will not be received.
Every petition for a private bill must be headed by a
short title descriptive of the undertaking, corresponding
with that at the head of the advertisement, and with the
agent's declaration (a); and with the short title of the bill
as entered on the votes. This title must be in accordance
with the subject matter of the bill, and must not be
changed unless by special order of the house (b).
The petition must be signed by the parties, or some
of them, who are suitors for the bill, as the signature
of the agent, although named as the agent of all the peti
tioners is not sufficient (c).
The petition of a corporation must be under seal, as
being the only legal mode in which such a body can
act.
The body of the petition is generally drawn up in the
form of a prayer addressed to the House of Commons, in
which the petitioners state, that a railway from a certain
place to another certain place, passing through certain
districts, would not only be of great advantage to the
petitioners, but would tend to the improvement of the
country, by offering a cheap, speedy, and safe conveyance
for passengers, goods, aud merchandize; and praying that
leave may be given to bring in a bill for effecting the pur
pose aforesaid.

In what cases
necessary.
In case additional provisions are required to be inserted
in the bill in a subsequent stage of the parliamentary pro
ceedings, they must, in like manner, be introduced by a
petition for that purpose presented to the House; and all
particulars required for the original petition, are also
rcquired in the petition for such additional provisions.
The petition should be carefully drawn, and should cor
respond in all respects with the bill, and embrace all the
powers sought to be obtained. For, although on its being
discovered at a later stage of the proceedings, that the
preamble of the bill is too large, a part of the matter may
be withdrawn, without evidence being required of the
truth of such part; yet, though the part withdrawn be
unnecessary, still if it form the fundamental allegation of
the petition on the credit of which leave was given to
bring in the bill, the promoters will be held to the terms
of their original application; and, unless the petition cor
respond with the bill, an objection may be taken at any
stage of its progress, and on motion made in the House
thereupon the bill is liable to be dismissed (a).
The receipt of all documents required by the standing
orders to be deposited in the Private Bill Office, must
be acknowledged by one of the clerks thereof upon the
petition (b).
So it must be duly endorsed by the examiner of peti
tions (c), with his certificate as to compliance, or non-com
pliance with standing orders.
Annexed to the petition must be a declaration in writing
by the agent for the bill, stating to which of the three
classes of bills it belongs, in all cases in which it gives
power to effect any of the following objects:—that is to
say, power to take any lands or houses compulsorily, or to
extend the time granted by any former act for that pur
pose; power to levy tolls, rates, or duties, or, to confer,

CHAP. 1.] IN CORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 105
vary, or extinguish, any exemptions from tolls, rates, or
duties, or any other right or privilege; power to amalga
mate with any other company, or sell or lease their under
taking, or to purchase or take on lease the undertaking of
any other company; power to interfere with any crown,
church, or corporation property, held in trust for public
or charitable purposes; power to make a burial ground;
power to relinquish any part of a work authorised by a
former act; power to divert into any intended cut, canal,
reservoir, aqueduct, or navigation, or into any intended
variation, extension, or enlargement thereof, respectively,
any water from any existing cut, canal, reservoir, aque
duct, or navigation, whether directly or derivatively, and
whether under any agreement with the proprietor thereof
or otherwise; power to make, vary, extend, or enlarge any
railway.
This declaration must state which of any such powers
are given by the bill, and indicate in which clauses (refer
ring to them by number) such powers are given; and
shall further state, that the bill does not give power to
effect any of the objects hereinbefore enumerated, other
than those stated in the declaration. If none of the above
powers are conferred by the bill, the declaration must be
to that effect (a). -
The bill must be properly entitled, and the short title
of the bill, as first entered in the votes, must correspond
with that at the head of the advertisement, and must not
be changed without the special order of the house (b).
In addition to the clauses required by standing orders
to be inserted in all railway bills, it was usual previous to
the session of 1845, to introduce every provision necessary
for the regulation of a railway company, not only with
regard to the internal management of the concern, as the
making of calls, holding of meetings, special and general,
the appointment of officers, the payment of dividends, the

raising of loans, and all other matters connected with the
government of the company, but also for the control of its
external affairs, and its relations to third parties, as taking
lands for the purposes of the railway, the mode of con
structing and working the line, either as owners of it or
as common carriers.
The insertion of so many sections in every bill not only
rendered it exceedingly cumbrous, but at the same time,
by reason of the doubts that frequently arose in respect of
the construction of many of the clauses, opened the way to
much litigation and dispute.
To remedy this evil, and to comprise in a few general
statutes the provisions usually inserted in each special rail
way act; and also for the purpose of ensuring greater uni
formity in the provisions thereof, three Acts of Parliament
have been passed, which (save where they are expressly
varied, controlled, or excepted, by any special act) are to
apply to every railway Act receiving the royal assent sub
sequent to the 8th of May 1845, and are to be considered
as incorporated therewith.
The first of these statutes (7 and 8 Vic.c. 16), called “The
Companies’ Clauses Consolidation Act,” prescribes the mode
in which the amount of the capital authorized by the special
Act to be raised shall be distributed into shares; the
time and manner of the payment thereof; the forms and
conditions of transfer and forfeiture of shares; the mode
of borrowing money; the application of the capital; the
calling of meetings, general and special, with the manner
of voting thereat; the election of directors, their powers,
liabilities, and duties; the appointment of auditors; the
keeping of accounts; the declaring of dividends; the
making of bye-laws; the settling of disputes by arbitra
tion; the serving of notices by and upon the company;
together with the mode of recovering damages and penal
ties from parties who have become liable thereto under
the Act.
This statute contains all the powers ordinarily required
CHAP. I.] IN CORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 107
for the management of the internal affairs of the company;
but should the promoters require any extraordinary autho
rity not therein conferred, they are at liberty, subject,
however, to the approval of the legislature, to insert clauses
in their special Act, to meet the particular exigencies of
the occasion.
The statute next in succession (the 7th and 8th Vic. c. 18),
and known by the name of “The Lands Clauses Consolida
tion Act,” prescribes the mode of taking the lands required
for public undertakings, either by agreement or compulso
rily, together with the mode of ascertaining the amount of
compensation due to the parties whose property may be
taken, or whose interests may be injuriously affected by the
execution of the works.
It specifies further how the amount of such compensa
tion is to be paid and recovered in different cases, the
measure and mode of obtaining the costs, the forms and
particulars of the conveyance to the company, and gene
rally all other necessary particulars; so that it can seldom,
if ever, be needful to insert in the special Act any clauses
relating to the voluntary or compulsory purchase and sale
of lands for the purposes of the undertaking.
The last of the three general railway Acts (7 and 8 Vic.
c. 20), called “The Railways Clauses Consolidation Act,”
prescribes the mode of executing the works; confers certain
limited authority to make alterations in and deviations from
the original plans; provides for the temporary use of lands,
and for the purchase of additional lands; the crossing of
turnpike and other roads and canals; the construction of
bridges; levels; works for accommodation of adjoining
lands, for the making of branch railways; the working of
mines, and everything relating to the construction of the
line; and prescribes the mode of levying tolls for passengers
and goods; and the making of bye-laws necessary for the
safe and convenient working of the line. In addition, it
contains enactments concerning the construction and using
of engines and carriages; the mode of working railways

by lessees; reference to arbitrations; and the recovery of
penalties.
A careful perusal of the above statutes will convince
the reader that almost every possible case that can arise,
either in relation to the self-government of the company,
the taking of lands for the purposes of the undertaking, or
the construction and working of the line, has been antici
pated and provided for, and that consequently the length
of the special Act is greatly reduced, and all the re
quisite provisions may be comprised in a small compass,
whilst uniformity of legislation is secured in all railway
Acts.
Notwithstanding these general and comprehensive
statutes, it may, however, be necessary to insert special
clauses in respect of the formation of the line, protecting,
modifying, or extinguishing the interests of either private
individuals or public bodies; and the nature of the pro
visions so introduced will, of course, depend entirely upon
the circumstances of each particular case.
The subjects most frequently requiring the introduction
of special clauses as to the execution of the works, are the
mode of crossing public roads, canals, &c., and of obtain
ing convenient access to lands severed by the railroad.
Subject to the requirements of the standing orders of
the two Houses, and the provisions of the general railway
statutes, the following will be found a correct enumeration
of the clauses usually introduced into a special railway
Act :—
The incorporation of the 8 Vic. cc. 16, 18, 20, with the
special Act.
The name and title of the Act.
The incorporation of the subscribers.
The amount of capital.
The number of shares and amount of each.
The amount of call and time of making.
The power to borrow money.

must be made by the parties, in like manner, to one of the
clerks in the Office of the Clerk of the Parliament, whose
warrant or order will authorize the payment of the money.
Before the recent alterations, the above applications
were required to be in writing, and signed by five of the
directors, but the language of the Act of Parliament under
which they are now to be made, is general, leaving it
doubtful whether the application is to be in person or by
writing. It would seem that, inasmuch as the parties
from whom permission is now to be obtained, are clerks
in the parliamentary offices, whereas formerly they were
the chairman of committees of the House of Lords, and
the speaker of the House of Commons, a personal applica
tion would suffice.
If, however, it be made in writing, the formalities here
tofore prescribed in respect of that document had better
be observed. Thus the application ought tostate the name
or description of the work or undertaking; the names and
places of abode of the directors signing it; the sum of
money required to be paid; and the bank and name into
which the same is to be paid.
If the undertaking is to be carried out in England, the
money must be paid into the Bank of England, in the
name of the accountant-general of the Court of Chancery;
or if in Scotland, into some one of the banks in Scotland,
established by Act of Parliament or Royal Charter, at the
option of the parties, in the name of the Queen’s Remem
brancer of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland; or into
the Bank of Ireland, to the name of the accountant

general of the Court of Chancery in Ireland, in case the ,
work is to be executed in Ireland. It is observable that
there is a discrepancy between the order of the House of
Commons prescribing the deposit, and the stat. 9th Vic.
c. 20, relating to the same subject, so far as regards the
payment of deposit in respect of railways to be made in
Scotland. The order gives the parties the alternative of
paying the money either into the Court of Chancery in
112 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book 11.
England, or the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, but the
statute only authorizes the payment of the money into the
name of the Queen's Remembrancer of the Court of Ex
chequer of Scotland (a).
Warrant to The warrant or order of the clerk of Parliament, or of
pay. the clerk of the Private Bill Office, as the case may be, will
be a sufficient authority for the officer, into whose name
the money is to be paid, to permit an account to be opened
in his name, in respect of the sum of money therein men
tioned. On obtaining such warrant, therefore, the di
rectors, after showing it to the officer named, and procur
ing his sanction, are entitled to make the required deposit
in the name prescribed.
Mode of pay- Formerly it was incumbent on the directors to make
" the deposit in cash, and if they required the money to be
invested in public securities, they were obliged to petition
the court for leave to do so. Considerable expense and
loss was thus incurred, as, in the first place, the directors
were compelled to convert the securities, in which the de
posits were invested, into money for the purpose of pay
ment; and, secondly, if they did not wish the deposits to
remain uninvested and unprofitable, they had further to
incur the expense of reinvesting them. By a recent Act,
however, it is provided, that when the directors shall have
previously invested in three per cent. consolidated, or the
three per cent, reduced bank annuities, exchequer bills,
or other government securities, the sum or sums of money
required to be deposited, in accordance with the standing
orders of either House of Parliament; it shall be lawful for
the directors named in the warrant or order to deposit
such exchequer bills, or other government securities, in
lieu of the payment of so much of the sum of money
required to be deposited, as aforesaid, as the same ex
chequer bills or other securities will extend to satisfy; at
the price at which the same were originally purchased by
(a) Ib. sec. 3.
CHAP. I.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 113
the directors, such price to be proved by production of
the broker's certificate of the original purchase.
Should the amount of deposit have been paid in cash,
and should the persons named in the order or warrant, or
the survivors of them, be desirous of having the money so
paid in invested, they may, on a petition presented to the
court in the name of the accountant-general, or other
officer in whose name the same may have been paid, ob
tain an order that such sum shall, until the same be paid
out of court in pursuance of the Act, be laid out in the
purchase of three per cent. consolidated, or three per cent.
reduced bank annuities, or any other government secu
rities (a).
On the termination of the session of Parliament in which
the bill is introduced, or on the rejection or final with
drawal thereof, by some proceeding in either House, or if
the bill be not allowed to proceed, or if the parties who
have made the deposit shall not have presented any peti
tion for a bill, or if an Act shall have been passed autho
rizing the proposed works, then, in either of these cases,
the parties who made the deposit are entitled, on proper
application for that purpose, to have the cash paid returned,
or the government securities in which it has been invested
transferred into their names (b).
This application is made by petition to the court, in the
name of whose accountant-general the sum of money men
tioned in the warrant shall have been paid. The proper
petitioners are the parties, or the survivors of the parties,
who paid in the money; and although the Act provides
that a majority of them are entitled to receive the deposit
back, still the Court of Chancery has refused to grant the
order, unless all the parties are named in the petition. In
a case, therefore, where a railway company (whose bill at

SEC. VIII.—Examiners of Petitions.
FoRMERLY all petitions, after being presented to the House,
were referred, as a matter of course, to one of the sub
committees on petitions, that they might ascertain whether
the petitioners had complied with standing orders; but
by an order of the House, in the session of 1846, the com
mittees on petitions were abolished, and their duties trans
ferred to officers called examiners of petitions.
The Speaker is required to appoint one or more officers,
to be called “Examiners of Petitions for Private Bills,” with
power to remove them and appoint others if he think fit (a).
One of such examiners is to be appointed chiefexaminer (b).
Compliance with standing orders must now be proved
before one of the examiners of petitions for private bills (c),
and the examination of the petitions is to commence on
the 15th day of January, in such order, and according to
such regulations, as shall be made by the Speaker, and the
chief examiner is to make arrangements for the distribution
of the business among the examiners (d).
The chief examiner of bills is required to give at least
seven clear days’ notice in the Private Bill Office of the
day, appointed for the examination of each petition; and
in case the promoters shall not appear at the time when
the petition should come on to be heard, the examiner to
whom the case shall have been allotted shall strike the
petition off the list, and shall not reinsert the same except
by order of the House (e).
If the petition for a private bill shall have been struck
out of the examiner's list, a petition must be presented to
the House for its reinsertion, which will be referred to the
select committee on standing orders (f), who will report
whether, in their opinion, such petition ought or ought

not to be inserted, and, if reinserted, under what (if any)
conditions (a).
On the day appointed, the agents of the petitioners for
the bill must attend before the examiner, and proceed to
give formal proofs of the several particulars required by
the standing orders. Proof of compliance with those
standing orders which refer to the affixing to the church
doors the requisite notices, and to the applications to
owners, lessees, and occupiers, may be given by the pro
duction of affidavits, sworn, in case of an English railway,
before a justice of the peace, and, in case of a Scotch
railway, before a sheriff-depute or his substitute, and, in
case of an Irish railway, before any judge or assistant
barrister, unless, in any of the above cases, the examiner
shall require further evidence (b). With respect, however,
to the proof of compliance with all other requirements of
the standing orders, evidence must be given by the parties
who did the particular act enjoined; and the formal com
pleteness of documents must be shown by the production
of the documents themselves.
Thus the due deposit of plans, books of reference, sub
scription contracts, and other documents, with the proper
parties, and at the proper times, must be proved by the
persons who made the deposit.
The proper execution of the subscription contract must
be proved by its production, and by the evidence of the
attesting witnesses. The due insertion of notices in the
Gazette and other public papers, together with the suffi
ciency thereof, will be evidenced by the production of the
several papers.
The above formal proofs having been furnished to the
satisfaction of the examiner of petitions, if there be no
opposition on standing orders, he will endorse on the pe
tition that the standing orders have been complied with.
If, however, there be any opposition with regard to such
(a) H.C. 60. (b) H.C. 12, 13, 14.
CHAP. I.] IN CORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 117
prescribed formalities as do not come specifically under
the notice of the examiner on proof of matters of form,
such as objections to the accuracy and sufficiency of the
several plans, sections, books of reference, notices, parlia
mentary contracts, and other documents, then the validity
of such objections, and compliance in these respects with
standing orders, will be inquired into by the examiner
when the opposing petitioners are heard.
Any parties will be at liberty to appear, and be heard
by themselves, their agents, and witnesses, upon a memorial
addressed to the examiner, complaining of a non-com
pliance with standing orders, provided the matter com
plained of be specifically stated in such memorial, and that
the party affected by the non-compliance with the standing
orders shall have signed such memorial, and that such
memorial be deposited in the Private Bill Office, three
clear days before the day first appointed for the examina
tion of the petition (a). *
If the proceedings before the examiner of petitions are
to be regulated by the former rules as to proceedings be
fore the committee on petition, and the memorial com
plaining of non-compliance with standing orders is to be
looked at in the same light as a petition, the formalities
prescribed in respect of the latter will also apply to the
former.
Thus the name or short title by which the bill petitioned
against is entered on the votes, must be written at the
beginning of the memorial, otherwise the memorialists will
not be heard by the examiner: so the memorial must state
specifically the matters complained of, and no evidence of
facts not stated will be admitted. If the memorial be
generally against the bill, without enumerating any spe
cific objections, the examiner of petitions will not be
at liberty to take cognizance of any such general al
legations.

Formerly any party whatever, whether interested or not
in the non-compliance with standing orders, was entitled
to oppose by petition; but by the construction put upon
the order relating to opposition before the committee on
petitions (which order is similar to that relating to pro
ceedings before the examiner), by the various committees
sitting in the session of 1846, this rule has been somewhat,
and not unreasonably, straitened. It is now held that any
person whatever, whether affected individually or not, has
a right to oppose on standing orders for any non-com
pliance therewith affecting the public, such as the incom
pleteness of the parliamentary contract, omission to depo
sit the necessary plans, or any other irregularity which
cannot be said to affect an individual; but, on the other
hand, if the non-compliance complained of is merely per
sonal and private, such as the neglect to serve the proper
notices, or any other oversight of a like nature, a petition
must be presented signed by the party affected.
The petitioners for the bill, and the memorialists com
plaining of non-compliance with standing orders, may ap
pear, either in person or by their parliamentary (a) agent,
and produce witnesses in support of the allegations of their
respective petitions. It has, however, been held that the
parties signing the petition in favour of the bill, if objected
to, have no claim to be examined as witnesses in its sup
port.
No provision is made in the new order directing the
appointment, and regulating the proceedings, of examiners
of petitions for compelling the attendance of witnesses, or
the production of documents. Nor is it easy to see in
what manner these objects can be effected. Formerly, on
the refusal of a witness to attend, and complaint thereof
by the chairman of the committee on petitions to the
Speaker of the House, steps were taken to compel his
(a) We believe the word “agent,” which is the word used in the order, has
been decided to mean parliamentary agent only.
CHAP. I.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 119
attendance, or punish him for obstinate refusal. But, by
the new orders, the examiners of petitions are to begin
the discharge of their duties at a period earlier than that
at which the House usually assembles, and whilst the
Speaker has no authority over the parties whose evidence
may be required. Under these circumstances, if the in
vestigation before the examiner be either defeated or
impeded through the obstinate refusal to attend of those
whose testimony is required, either by the petitioners for
the bill or the memorialists against it, the only course
open to the parties would appear to be to apply to the
examiner to adjourn the inquiry until, by the assembling
of the House, the attendance of the witnesses might be
compelled by the Speaker's authority; or if there be no
power to adjourn, then for the examiner to strike the
petition before him out of the list, endorsing thereon a
minute of the circumstances under which that course was
pursued, when, on proper application, after the session
commenced, the petition could be re-inserted by special
order of the House, and the investigation prosecuted, with
the advantages of a compulsory power to obtain the
witnesses and the documents which might be found
necessary.
After the examiner of petitions has received evidence of Certificate of
the several particulars required, and also heard the parties
in opposition, he is required to certify by endorsement on
each petition which shall have been deposited in the Pri
vate Bill Office, whether the standing orders have or have
not been complied with ; and when they have not been
complied with, he must also report to the House the facts
upon which his decision is founded, and any special cir
cumstances connected with the case.(a) Should he feel
any doubt as to the due construction of any standing
order in its application to a particular case, he is to make
a special report of the facts to the House, without deciding
whether the standing order in question has or has mot

been complied with ; and in such case he must endorse
the petition with the words “Special Report,” either alone,
or, if non-compliance with other standing orders shall have
been proved, in addition to the words “Standing orders
not complied with.”(a) The petition, with these endorse
ments, will lie in the Private Bill Office until required to be
presented to the House.

CHAPTER II.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
SEC. I.—Petition for a Bill.
No private bill can be brought into the House of Com
mons except upon petition first presented, with a printed
copy of the proposed bill annexed. The petition must be
signed by the parties, or some of them, who are suitors
for the bill, and be duly endorsed by the examiner of
petitions.(a)
The petition for leave to bring in a bill to form a railway
must be placed in the hands of a member of the House for
the purpose of presentation. Any member can present the
petition, but it is usual to entrust it to the members of
the city or place more immediately affected by the pro
posed measure, the parliamentary agent generally giving
the member who has charge of the bill due notice and
information as to the times when he will be required to
make the particular motions.
On the day when the petition is to be presented, the
member puts down his name on the Speaker's private
business list. At the sitting of the House on the same
day, on being called upon in his turn, the member in
charge of it rises and presents it.
The petition must be presented to the House on or before
a day tobe appointed at the commencement of the session.(b)

original petition notwithstanding. This petition to allow
the usual rule to be dispensed with is referred to the Select
Committee on Standing Orders; and if the committee re
port that the prayer of it should be complied with, a petition
will be presented as in other cases.(a)
Until the recent alterations all petitions for private bills,
on being presented to the House, were referred, as a matter
of course, to the Committee on Petitions. This committee
has, however, been abolished by the standing orders of
last session (1846), and its duties transferred to the
examiner of petitions, whose functions and proceedings
have already been explained.(b)
When the petition has been presented, if it bear an
endorsement, under the hand of the examiner, of compli
ance with standing orders, the prayer of it will be granted
as of course, and leave given for the bill to be introduced.
But if the examiner shall have endorsed thereon non-com
pliance with standing orders, or shall have made a special
report to the House, in either of these cases the petition
will be referred to the Select Committee on Standing
Orders.(c)
SEC. II.—Select Committee on Standing Orders.
THIs committee is appointed at the commencement of every
session, and consists of eleven members, of whom five are a
quorum.(d) The agent for the bill and the committee clerk
appoint a day for meeting at the convenience of the chair
man of the Committee on Standing Orders, a written notice
of which day is given to the members of the committee,
and also inserted in the daily votes. In those cases in
which the petition referred to the committee is endorsed
with “non-compliance with standing orders,” if there be

any special circumstances or reasons why compliance with
standing orders should be dispensed with, the parliament
ary agent should make a written statement thereof, a copy
of which should be delivered to the opponents (if they
apply for the same) at least twenty-four hours before the
meeting of the committee.
The committee may (though it is not usual to do so)
hear the petitioners in proof or in explanation of this
written statement; but evidence of no other facts than
those contained in such statement and counter-statement
can be received.
In those cases, however, in which there has been a
special reportof the examiner as to the construction of a
standing order, the committee are to determine according
Evidence,
to their construction thereof, and on the facts stated in such -
report, whether the standing orders have or have not been
complied with; and they will then either report to the
House that the standing orders have been complied with,
or proceed to consider the question whether they should or
should not be dispensed with.(a)
After the committee have examined and considered the
circumstances of the case, in which non-compliance with
standing orders is endorsed, and the facts reported by the
examiner of petitions, when there is a doubt as to the
construction of a standing order, and have come to a
determination, they make a report to the House whether
such standing orders as have not been complied with ought
or ought not to be dispensed with, and whether in their
opinion the parties should be permitted to proceed with
their bill, or any portion thereof, and under what, if any,
conditions; and also a report of the construction which
they put upon the standing order, in respect of which a
special report shall have been made, together with their
opinion as to whether or not in the particular case it has
been observed or may be dispensed with. (b)

If the committee determine that standing orders should
be dispensed with, a report to that effect is made and a
bill brought in, as in cases where the petition bore an
endorsement of compliance with standing orders.
Should, however, the report be that standing orders
disobeyed ought not to be dispensed with, the bill is gene
rally considered at an end—at all events for that session of
Parliament. Although it is usual in such cases to abandon
the bill, the determination of the Committee on Standing
Orders is not final and conclusive, as the promoters may
petition the House to have the bill referred back, or to
have the particular order disobeyed dispensed with, and so
permit the bill to proceed, notwithstanding the unfavour
able report of the Committee on Standing Orders. The
House is very unwilling to interfere with the decisions of
its committees, and it is only under very peculiar circum
stances that the House will be induced to grant the indul
gence prayed.(a)
SEC. III.—Presentation and first Reading of the Bill.
IF the report of the examiner of petitions, or of the
standing orders’ committee, be favourable, some member
of the house must move that the report be read, and leave
be given to bring in the bill. Leave having been given
accordingly, the bill may be presented to the House on
the next or any following day.(b) In urgent cases it has
been permitted to present it on the same day.
The bill must be printed on paper of the size determined
by the Speaker, with a cover of parchment to it, upon
which the title, as first entered on the votes, has been

written,(a) and printed copies must be delivered to the
doorkeeper for the use of the members of the House (b)
before the bill can be read the first time.
The first reading of the bill may take place on the day
of presentation. It was formerly the practice of the
House of Commons to fix a day in each session as the last
in which private bills might be read a first time; but in
the session of 1846 no day was fixed, the immense amount
of business preventing the committees on petitions and
standing orders from getting through all the cases referred
to them in the ordinary time; but to obviate delay it was
resolved by the House,(c) “That no private bill can be read
a first time later than the next day but one after the
report of the committee on petitions, or of the standing
orders' committee, as the case may be, shall have been laid
on the table by special order of the House.” Should there
be any particular reason for not reading the bill within
the time limited, a petition must be presented praying for
an extension of the time.
The House will grant or refuse the prayer of the petition
as they may think fit; it ought, however, to be made
before the time limited for the first reading has expired.
Previous to the sitting of the House on the day on which
it is intended to present the bill, one of the members
appointed to bring it in puts his name down on the
Speaker's private list. At the sitting of the House the
member seats himself at the bar, and is called on in turn
by the Speaker, and the question is put—that the bill be
now read a first time.
This is generally done as a matter of course; and al
though a member of the House is entitled to oppose a bill
at any stage, the practice is never to do so on the first
reading. At the time of the first reading, an order is
made, as of course, for the second reading, which, however,

does not take place immediately, the order being a per
mission to proceed at a future time.
After the bill has been read a first time, its name or
short title should be copied by the clerks of the Private
Bill Office, from the clerk’s minute-book of the day, into a
separate book, to be called the “examination book,”
wherein must be noted the number of such bill according
to the order in which it was read, and the date of the first
reading (a).
After the title has thus been examined and copied for
the votes, a private bill is in the custody of the clerks of
the Private Bill Office, until laid upon the table for the
second reading (b).
A breviate of the bill must be prepared, drawn out in
the manner prescribed from time to time by the Speaker,
containing a statement of the objects of the bill, and a
summary of the proposed enactments, specifying any va
riation of the general law intended to be effected by the
bill (c).
Between the first and second reading of any private bill,
every such bill, according to its priority, is to be examined
by the clerks of the Private Bill Office, as to its conform
ity with the rules and standing orders of the House; and
if not in due form, the examining clerk will specify thereon
the page in which any irregularity occurs, entering his
name and the day of examination in the examination
book (d).
This breviate must have been printed and laid on the
table of the House three clear days (e), and all the fees
payable on the bill must be paid (f), before it can be read
a second time. Though this has been the rule, however,
the practice has been not to pay the fees until the bill is
ready for the royal assent.

tions complaining solely of non-compliance with standing
orders, in respect of any private bill, must be presented to
the House previously to the second reading, unless in the
case of those standing orders which must necessarily be
taken into consideration by the committee on the bill (a);
but inasmuch as parties complaining of any non-observance
of standing orders are now to make their complaint by
memorial presented to the examiner of petitions, the above
provision is rendered unnecessary.
SEC. IV.—Second Reading.
THERE must be three clear days notice in writing, given
by the agent for the bill to the clerk in the Private Bill
Office, of the day proposed for the second reading of the
bill (b).
There must be an interval of three clear days between
the first and second readings (c), and of two calendar
months from the day the last notice appeared in the Ga
zette or provincial papers (d). The House, however, by a
resolution of February 12, 1846, resolved, that there must
not be more than seven clear days between the first and
second readings of any railway bill, except by special order
of the House. This resolution, in case of the early meeting
of Parliament, might conflict with the order as to the in
terval between the last notice in the Gazette and the second
reading.
The above requisites having been complied with, the
agent for the bill gives information, either to the member
who presented the petition, or to any other member, as to
the day for which the notice of the second reading has
been given.

The second reading of the bill may (at the desire of its
promoters or its opponents) either be made an order of
the day, or be inserted in the Speaker’s private business
list.
In the former case it is not moved with the private busi
ness, but is taken with the orders of the day; in the latter,
(if permitted to take its course) it is called on in turn by
the clerk at the table. The member having entered his
name on the Speaker’s private list, before the sitting of the
House on the day appointed, moves, “That the order of
the day for the second reading of the bill be now read;
and that the bill be read a second time.” Or if the bill
had been entered on the Speaker's private business list
merely, “That the bill be read a second time.” On either
of such motions, unless the bill has been successfully op
posed, it is read a second time, and ordered to be referred
to the committee named in the order. This committee is
called the Committee of Selection (a), and the bill is then
said to be committed, and is in the custody of the clerk of
the committee, to which it is referred until reported (b).
Opposition to the substance of the bill may be, and
generally is, made at the second reading of it. Thus, if
there is anything dangerous in its principle, as being
against public policy, or some known rule of law, it should
be mooted at this stage, whilst any objection to particular
provisions is generally deferred, and urged before the
committee on the bill.
Any opposition made to a bill by any other than a mem
ber of the House, must be by petition duly presented; but
any member of the House is, of course, at liberty to oppose,
without previously presenting a petition.
If the second reading be opposed, some member moves
to leave out the word now from the motion before the
House, and to substitute therefor the words “this day six
months.”

CHAP. II.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 129
Should the second reading be postponed for six months,
or be simply refused, no new bill for the same object can
be brought into the House during that session.
SEC. V.—Committee of Selection, and Committee on an
Unopposed Bill.
ALL private bills, whether opposed or unopposed, after
having been read a second time, are referred to a commit
tee called the Committee of Selection (a). Once in their
hands, however, the mode of proceeding is entirely diffe
rent when a bill is opposed, from what it is if unopposed.
We shall consider, in this section, the constitution and
functions of the Committee of Selection in respect of both
classes, and the constitution and functions of the com
mittee to whom an unopposed bill is referred. (a) Committee
The Committee of Selection consists of the chairman of of selection.
theSelectCommittee on Standing Orders, and the members
of the general committee of elections, of whom three are
a quorum (b).
It is the duty of this committee to refer every bill sub
mitted to them, according as it is opposed or unopposed,
to a committee formed as required in each case by the
standing orders, and as more particularly mentioned be
low (c).
The clerk to the Committee of Selection mustgive seven
clear days’ notice to the clerks in the Private Bill Office,
of the day appointed for the sitting of the committee on
the bill, whether opposed or unopposed (d). Unless this
be done, all the proceedings of the committee will be void.
So the Committee of Selection must give notice to the
selected members (e) of a committee on an opposed bill,

that their names have been placed thereon, and of the
time when the committee is to meet (a). They will also
name such selected members (b), and direct what number
of them shall be a quorum (c).
Seven clear days must elapse between the second read
ing of a bill and the sitting of the committee thereon (d).
Subject to this order, however, the committee of selec
tion are to fix the time for the holding of the first sitting
of every committee, but, in the case of an unopposed bill,
after communication with the members who are to form
the committee thereon (e).
The order requiring seven days to elapse between the
second reading of a bill and the sitting of the committtee,
applies both to opposed and unopposed bills; but now
that there is a classification of railway projects, and a di
vision of them into groups, it may often happen that the
promoters will be unable to comply with this order, as the
day appointed for the meeting of the select committee on
the group to which the bill in question is referred, may be
even previous to the second reading of many of the bills
included in such group. In such cases, the parties may
either petition the House to have their bill admitted into
the group without compliance with this order, or to post
pone the meeting of the committee on the group.
The committee on an unopposed railway bill, originated
in the House of Commons, consists of the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, and the members ordered
to prepare and bring in the bill (f), of whom the former
and one of the latter are a quorum, and the former is
chairman of the committee (g).
No bill is to be considered by the Committee of Selection
as opposed, unless a petition against it (h) has been pre
sented, in which the petitioners pray to be heard by them
selves, their counsel, or agent, except in cases where the

chairman of Ways and Means shall have reported to the
House that in his opinion any bill should be so treated (a).
A copy of the bill, filled up as it is proposed to be sub
mitted to the committee, and signed by the agent, must
be deposited at the Private Bill Office one clear day before
the meeting of the committee (b), and a similar copy must
be laid by the agent before the chairman at the time of
giving notice of the meeting of the committee thereon,
and before each other member of the committee three
days at least before the day appointed for their first meet
ing (c).
The committee having instituted a careful examination
of all the clauses of the bill, and considered all the mat
ters relating thereto, submitted to them by the agent and
the promoters, will, if they deem the preamble ofthe bill to
be proved, and are of opinion that there is nothing objec
tionable in its provisions, report to the House accordingly (d).
The chairman, however, is at liberty to report that, in
his opinion, the bill submitted to them should be treated
as an opposed bill, in which case it will be referred back to
the Committee of Selection, and dealt with by them as an
opposed private bill (e).
SEc. VI.—Select Committee on an Opposed Bill.
If the bill be opposed, it is referred by the Committee of
Selection to a selectcommittee,for further consideration (f).
The committee on every opposed private bill consists of
the members on the Speaker's list for that county, or divi
sion of a county, to which the bill specially relates, and of
such number of selected members not locally interested in
the bill in progress, and in such proportion as the Com

the quorum of selected members, is a quorum (a).
Each member of the committee, before he is entitled to
attend and vote, must sign a declaration that he will not
vote on any question without having duly heard and at
tended to the evidence relating thereto. In addition to
this, each member nominated by the Committee of Selec
tion must sign a declaration that his constituents have no
local interest, and that he has no personal interest in the
bill (b). The agent for the bill must give seven clear days’
notice (and in case of a recommitted bill, three clear days’
notice) in writing to the clerks in the Private Bill Office,
of the day and hour appointed for the meeting of the com
mittee (c).
A filled-up bill (signed by the agent), as proposed to be
submitted to the committee, (or in case of a recommitted
bill, as proposed to be submitted to the committee on re
committal) must be deposited in the Private Bill Office
one clear day before the meeting of the committee, and
all parties will be entitled to a copy thereof upon payment
of the charges for making out the amendments of such
bill (d).
The Committee of Selection, subject to the order that
there be seven clear days between the second reading and
the sitting of the committee, fix the time for holding the
first meeting of the committee on an opposed bill (e).
Should any postponement of the first meeting take place,
the clerk to the committee must give notice to the clerks

However, in cases in which any member is unable to

This committee have no authority to examine into the

As there is a doubt whether they can compel the at

the committee on the bill (naming it) should have power

shall be of opinion that due diligence has been used, and
proper efforts made to procure the attendance of witnesses,
and production of documents required, they will grant the

duces the plans and books of reference, and all the papers
that have been previously lodged in the Private Bill Office.
The committee have the power to make any alteration
in the preamble of the bill, subject to the following restric
tions:—That nothing in any degree inconsistent with the
notices given, in compliance with the standing orders of
the house applicable to the bill, should be introduced.
That every alteration, &c., made in a preamble, should
be specially noticed in the report of the bill to the House;
and that, together with the notices in the report of any al
teration so made in the preamble, the ground of making it
should be stated (a).
They have power, moreover, subject to the above limita
tions, to alter the various clauses of the bill.
So they may, subject to the same restrictions, make
alterations in the plans deposited. These alterations and
amendments are to be marked by the chairman of the
committee with his name and initials, in the manner pre
scribed by standing orders of the House of Commons (b).
The most material alterations made in the preamble of
a bill, during its progress through committee, generally
relate to the abandoning of a portion of the line, or any
branches, or postponing them to a future period. Should
the committee, however, be desirous of making any altera
tions, such as the dividing a bill into two, or consolidating
several bills, they have no such power of themselves, but
must apply to the House for permission. Their jurisdic
tion seems only to extend to the bill before them, upon
the whole or any part of which they are competent to
decide.
Although any individual whatever may petition the house
against a bill, it may be laid down as a general rule that
a person must have some interest likely to be affected by
the execution of the proposed work, or he will not be per

mitted to appear before the select committee, by his coun
sel and witnesses. As to the nature and amount of the
interest so required, it is impossible to form any correct
idea; there have been so many conflicting decisions on the
subject by the various committees on railways, that any
attempt to lay down a general rule would be likely to
mislead.
Ordinarily the opponents of a railway bill are either
the landowners whose property may be in some manner,
and to some extent, injured by the formation of the line;
or the promoters of rival schemes, who are attempting to
obtain a bill for a similar purpose.
We will now consider what interest is sufficient to give
a locus standi, first, to promoters of rival schemes; and,
secondly, to landowners on the line.
All competing schemes, which are referred to the same
committee, and their several promoters, have necessarily a
locus standi in opposition; and if the necessary notices
have been given, and deposits of plans, sections, and money,
have been made, the projectors of such schemes will be
entitled to be heard, although they have failed before the
Committee on Standing Orders, through non-compliance
with some of the formalities (a).
But it is not yet settled whether the projectors of a
scheme, competing in some respects with another, but not
included in the same group, have a locus standi as to such
competing part.
When the projectors of a scheme having no locus standi
are desirous of opposing, they generally do so by means
of some landowner, who is put forward as the nominal
petitioner, while the company, in fact, are the real oppon
ents, and pay all the expenses.
The projectors of a scheme provisionally registered, who
have not deposited their plans, given the proper notices, nor
taken the necessary steps to come before Parliament, have

no locus standi, although it may be their intention to bring

plan may be preferable to the one before the committee.
It is very difficult to state what interest in land gives a
person a locus standi to be heard in opposition to a bill.
Any person whose land has been included in the book
of reference, as a matter of course, can be heard, either
in person or by counsel; but the mere probability of the
value of his property being lessened by the construction of
the intended line, is not a sufficient ground of opposition,
although, if the property be likely to be physically injured,
as by throwing back water and rendering the drainage
incomplete, or by making it less accessible to the owner
thereof, even if not named in the book of reference, he
would be entitled to be heard.
Some committees have received evidence of consequen
tial damage very remote, and have even gone so far as to
allow parties who have merely an easement in the property
likely to be affected, although not included in the book of
reference (a) to be heard; while, on the other hand, a ca
mal company, whose lands were virtually cut through by
the intended line, were held not to have a sufficient inte
rest to entitle them to set up another line as preferable
and less likely to injure them. -
Any opposition to a railway bill before committee must
be by petition duly presented to the House, and no petition
can be taken into consideration by the committee on the
bill, unless it distinctly state the ground on which the pe
titioners object to any of the provisions thereof, and they
can only be heard on the ground so stated; and if the
committee should think the grounds are not stated with
sufficient accuracy, they may direct that there be given in
a more specific statement in writing, but limited to such
grounds of objection as were before specified (b).

particular grounds of opposition, will not be referred to
the committee, as it is regarded in the light of an ordinary
petition concerning a bill before the House, and not re
quiring special consideration. (a)
The petition must be in writing (b), signed by the peti
tioners, or, in case of their absence from the United
Kingdom, by their respective agents.(c) And if it be the
petition of a corporate body, it must be under their com
mon seal, or it cannot be recognised by the committee. (d)
It must also have upon it the name or short title of the
bill intended to be opposed, and must state whether the
petition be in favour of or against the bill.(e)
If the name or title of the bill petitioned against be not
inserted in the petition, or be inserted incorrectly, the
petitioners will not be heard.(f) Care must be taken in
specifying the grounds of opposition that they disclose
sufficient to give the petitioners a locus standi before the
committee; for unless that is done the petitioners will
not be heard, although in reality they may have ample
grounds of opposition to give them such a locus standi, and
they may be directly injured by the passing of the bill.
On the other hand, petitioners having specified in their
petition sufficient to give them a locus standi, have been
allowed to give evidence of consequential damage, which
of itself would not have sufficed to give them a right to be
heard.(g)
The petitioners in opposition cannot be heard before
the committee unless the petition shall have been pre
sented to the House three clear days before the day
appointed for the first meeting of the committee on the
group, unless the matter of complaint has arisen during
the progress of the bill before the said committee.(h)

Preliminaries.
Order in which
bills are taken.
In one case it was decided that the committee had no
power to entertain a petition presented later than three
days before the sitting (a) of the committee, although
expressly referred to them by a vote of the House; the
committee feeling bound by the standing order until it
was expressly repealed.
The petitions against a bill are referred by the House to
the committee on the bill, and an order is given that the
petitioners be heard by themselves, their counsel and
agents if they think fit, and that counsel be heard in favour
of the bill against the petitioners.
The committee having been duly convened, we come
now to consider the order in which the various petitions
for and against a bill are taken, together with the evidence
required by the petitioners for the bill, and what is admis
sible against them.
The petitions against a bill are referred, as we have
seen, if the grounds of opposition have been duly specified
in the petition, to the committee to whom the considera
tion of the bill itself is entrusted. On the assembling of
the committee, the first step generally taken is to read the
petition for the bill, and then all the petitions against it,
calling on the petitioners to support their case, and their
agents to produce their certificates, that their names have
been entered as such; and unless the agents produce
these certificates, the petitioners will not be allowed to be
heard.
Should the petitioners in opposition fail to appear, either
in person or by their agents, their opposition is considered
as abandoned, and they must state their intention to
oppose the bill before the case is commenced, or otherwise,
without the express sanction of the committee, they have
no right to be heard.
The bills relating to a particular district of country,
whether they be rival schemes or otherwise, are generally
referred in a group to one committee.
(a) Group N, 1845.
CHAP. 11.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 139
It is a common practice for the agents of the several
bills to agree among themselves as to the order in which
each bill is to be taken, and the committee usually accede
to any suggestion made by the parties; but if no such.
arrangement has been made, the bills are taken in the
order in which they were read a second time. -
The proceedings of select committees in respect of the
bills submitted to, them have varied in different commit
tees. It has been the practice with some to begin with
the bill first on the list, hear evidence both for and
against the preamble, and if satisfied that the petitioners
for the bill have made out their case, to decide that the
preamble is proved.
By this decision they consider themselves discharged
from the obligation of entering upon the consideration of
the rival schemes. Other committees, however, pursue
a different course, and hear the evidence for and against
all the bills in the group before they decide in favour of
any. -
Any committee having decided in favour of the preamble
of the bill, named first in the group, without inquiring
into the merits of the competing schemes, it then becomes
unnecessary to investigate them if they propose to supply
the same district of country with railway accommodation;
but if they have decided that the preamble of the first bill
has not been proved, the committee proceed to the next
on the list; and so on through the whole number, until
they are agreed to decide in respect of one that the pre
amble is proved.
This mode of proceeding may certainly in some cases be
more expeditious, but it can scarcely be said to be fair to
the promoters of those bills that happen to stand below
the successful one on the list. The first scheme, no
doubt, may be a very good one, but still it does not follow
that the others may not be better, and that some one, the
claims of which in this mode of inquiry may never be
investigated, may possess decided advantages over all its
Practices of
different com
mittees.

competitors in many respects, as in affording greater
accommodation to the district through which it passes, in
avoiding serious engineering difficulties and interference
with valuable property. The other practice above alluded
to is a fairer mode of conducting inquiries of this sort, and
has been adopted by some committees. This is not only
more satisfactory to the parties themselves, but more for
the benefit of the public than the former. By pursuing
this latter plan, the committee hear the evidence in
favour of all the competing lines referred to them before
they decide in favour of the preamble of any particular
bill. This may possibly consume the time and tax the
patience of the committee more than the system above
mentioned, but it is undoubtedly the best mode of pro
ceeding, and the most likely to effect the real object of
investigation before a committee. The merits and ad
vantage of all the proposed lines are fully elucidated and
examined, and their defects exposed; and the committee
are thus prepared to select from the various plans re
ferred to them the one that may be best in every re
spect, both as to economy and facility of construction,
public convenience and accommodation, and avoidance of
serious and unnecessary injury to the landowners through
whose property it is intended to be carried.
If this mode of conducting the inquiry be adopted,
the projectors of the line first on the list appear by
counsel in favour of their own preamble, and produce
evidence in support thereof. The witnesses are cross
examined first by the landowners, and then by the
promoters of the various competing schemes, after which
they are re-examined, as in the case of ordinary actions
at nisi prius.
The scheme second on the list is then called on, and a
similar course pursued; and so with all the others.
Whenever the landowners produce evidence against
the scheme under consideration, its projectors have the
right of reply; and when all the schemes have been
CHAP. II.] INCORforATION OF THE COMPANY. 141
examined, the counsel for the first concludes the inquiry
by a general reply.
The evidence required in support of a bill is very much (d) Evidence
regulated by the nature of the report to be specially made
by the committee.
The petitioners usually give proof of all the particulars
required to be reported on to the House by the committee,
and enumerated in a subsequent part of this work. So
proofs are frequently offered as to the direction and con
struction of the line, the sources of traffic, the number
and situations of the stations, and the public accommo
dation offered, and any other matters which may become
important in consequence of the line of argument adopted
by their opponents. Hence the particulars of the
evidence will depend on the number and nature of the
objections to be answered, and will vary in each individual

engineering advantages, and explaining the facilities and

are called from the principal places on the line to give
evidence as to the nature and probable amount of the
traffic to be expected, and the public accommodation to be
afforded; furnishing particulars as to the trade and re
sources of the district, the demand that exists for railway
communication, and the support which the proposed scheme
is likely to secure.
Formerly the projectors of railways were accustomed to
deposit plans and serve the requisite notices for alternative
lines, the selection from which was generally postponed
until the bill was referred to the committee. When the
projectors, with the advice of the committee, had decided
upon one as the most desirable plan, they were at liberty
to abandon the other, provided all the standing orders

with regard to the one chosen had been complied with.
But now, by standing order No. 27, the power of providing
alternative lines is entirely taken away. Projectors may
also withdraw part of the preamble of their bill, and be
excused from going into evidence of the truth of the part
withdrawn, provided such portion be unnecessary, and do
not involve any of the fundamental principles on which
the petition as originally presented was founded, or on
which the House may be supposed to have granted leave to
bring in the bill. Hence, in withdrawing any portion,
great care must be taken not to take away what is material,
lest the whole preamble should be destroyed, and the object
of the promoters utterly defeated.
We have in a former portion of this work remarked on
the necessity of caution in drawing the petition, that no
unnecessary averments be introduced, as the petitioners
may be called on to prove them, although the extraneous
matter is quite irrevelant to the main objects of the bill,
and separable therefrom.
In inquiries before a parliamentary committee, the rules
of evidence are not construed with the same strictness as
in courts of law; otherwise the petitioners in opposition,
whether landowners or projectors of rival schemes, would
be restricted in their proof to those grounds of opposition
specified in their petitions, and relating to matters solely
affecting themselves.
But if such grounds of opposition are specified in their
petition as suffice to give them a locus standi, it is imma
terial whether the other objections urged are such as affect
themselves or third parties. Thus, for example, we find
landowners are not merely allowed to give evidence of the
amount of injury and inconvenience, they may personally
suffer by the construction of the line, but to show by
general evidence that another and more convenient course,
both for themselves and the public, can be adopted.
Before some committees the landowners have been per
mitted to give in evidence the plans and sections of rival
CHAP. 11.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 143
companies, which have been duly deposited with Parlia
ment and the clerks of the peace, previous to the present
ation ofthe petition; and beforeothers opposing landowners
have even been suffered to put in plans and sections of their
own, showing how the line may be constructed so as to
avoid their lands. This latter practice, however, is cer
tainly objectionable, on the ground that the petitioners for
the bill have had no opportunity of testing the accuracy of
such plans. But the former cannot be said to be obnoxious
to this objection, ample opportunity having been afforded
to examine and scrutinise the correctness of the deposited
drawings.
The rule which allows the opponents of a bill, having
once established their right to be heard as parties affected
by its provisions, to urge every argument which they find
available for their purpose against it, is manifestly just and
politic, as it has the effect of bringing before the committee
more fully the real merits of the scheme under their con
sideration. Perhaps in some instances this indulgence has
been carried further than the public interests required,
and has had the effect of needlessly prolonging the in
quiry.
It is unnecessary to dwell further on the nature of the
evidence admissible in support of a petition against a
railway bill. For further information the reader is referred
to the appendix of Mr. Collier's able work on railways;
but, in conclusion, we may observe that while proper scope
should be allowed on both sides, that a comprehensive view
of the question may be taken; it would put an end to much
prolixity, and, consequently, most materially abridge the
labours of the committees, were some precise and definite
rules as to the admissibility of evidence, laid down by
standing orders. Judging from the great improvements
that have taken place in the mode of proceeding with pri
vate bills, both before the House on the several readings,
and before the respective committees to which they are

referred, we may safely presume that some such step will
be adopted.
After the committee have heard the evidence on both
sides, they consider among themselves whether the pream
ble of the bill be proved or not. If they decide that it is
not proved, and that the promoters have failed to establish
their case, the chairman of the committee reports to the
house, “That the allegations contained in the preamble
have not been proved to their satisfaction.” The com
mittee do not enter into any particulars, or assign any
reasons, for the conclusions at which they have arrived.
On the reportbeing made to the House, the bill is ordered
to lie on the table, and, generally speaking, no further
steps in the matter are taken, at all events for that session.
But if, on the other hand,the preamble is declared proved,
the committee then proceed to consider each clause in the
bill separately. The parties who have petitioned against
the bill generally, or against particular clauses, are then
allowed to offer any objections they may think fit. The
opinion of the committee is taken seriatim upon each
clause, until the whole of them have been discussed and
settled. This was formerly a more tedious process than it
is at present, but since the passing of 8 & 9 Vict, cc. 16, 18,
20, it has been much abridged.
After the bill, both in its preamble and its clauses, has
been thoroughly considered, the chairman puts the ques
tion, “That I do report the bill;” and this concludes the
labours of the committee.
It may be as well to remark that every plan and book
of reference which is produced in evidence before the
committee upon any private bill (whether it were neces
sary to be lodged in the Private Bill Office or not), must be
signed by the chairman of the committee with his name at
length, and he must also affix his initials to every altera
tion in the plans and books of reference sanctioned by the
committee.(a) Such plans and books of reference, after

Office.(a) The chairman must also sign at length a printed
copy of the bill called the committee bill, with the amend
ments fairly written, and put the initials of his name to
every clause added in the committee. (b)
The committee must report that the allegations of the
bill have been examined, that the parties concerned (when
consent is required) have given their consent to the satis

not, to the preamble, and gone through the several clauses;
and also, when any alteration shall have been made in
the preamble of the bill, they shall specially state in this
report the ground of making it.(d) They must also report
specially the following particulars — (e)
1. Capital and Loans.—The proposed capital of the
company formed for the execution of the project, and the
amount of any loans which they may be empowered to
raise by the bill.
2. Shares and Deposits.—The amount of shares sub

should be informed of.
After the report, containing the special matter before
mentioned, has been made, the committee clerk delivers
into the Private Bill Office a printed copy of the bill, with
the written amendments made in the committee, in which
bill all the clauses added by the committee must be regu
larly marked in those parts of the bill wherein they are to
be inserted (a).
The report having been drawn up by the committee
clerk, under the directions of the committee, the agent for
the bill must apply to the chairman to appoint a day for
bringing it up, which cannot be done until one clear day
after the last sitting of the committee.

He must also provide a fair bill, with the amendments
and clauses as agreed to by the committee, to accompany
the report. -
A day is appointed at the commencement of every ses
sion, as the last upon which reports from committees will
be received. Should that day be near at hand, and there
be no likelihood of terminating the investigation in com
mittee before the intervening period has elapsed, the
chairman should be instructed to obtain an extension of
the time.
For this purpose, he moves the House “That leave be
given to the committee to report on or before a certain
day.” If the proceedings are not terminated within the
extended time, and there is no chance of getting through
both Houses that session, it is advisable for the promoters
to withdraw their bill.
On the day named for bringing up the report, the chair
man of the committee presents it at the bar of the House;
the question is then put “That it be brought up,” and it
is thereupon ordered to lie on the table (a). The minutes
of the committee ought to be brought and laid on the
table of the House at the same time (b).
After the report has been brought up, the bill, as
amended in committee, (excepting in cases wherein the
committee shall report the amendments to be merely
verbal or literal,) is ordered to be printed at the expense
of the parties applying for the same, and copies must be
delivered to the door-keeper, for the use of the members,
three clear days at least before the consideration of the
report (c). A breviate also of the amendments made in
committee must be submitted to the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, and laid upon the table
of the House at least the day before the consideration of
the report (d).

there must be an interval of seven days between the time
of bringing up the report and the further consideration
thereof; but at present there is no such order, although
some days must necessarily elapse between the bringing
up the report and the consideration of it; as copies of the
amended bill, printed for the use of the members, must
be deposited with the door-keepers three clear days before
the consideration of the report, and such copies cannot be
printed until after the report has been brought up (a);
and one clear day’s notice in writing of the day appointed
for the consideration of the report must be given by
the agent for the bill to the clerks in the Private Bill
Office (b).
By a recent standing order (c) of the House of Com
mons, made with a view of affording an opportunity of
discussion on reports relating to railway bills, Tuesday and
Thursday in every week are specially appointed for this
purpose, and the House will not take the report on such
bills into consideration on any other day.
On the day appointed for the consideration of the
report, the member who presented the petition moves,
“That the report which, on last, was made
from the committee on the bill for making a railway from
to , be now taken into further con
sideration.”
Under the former practice of the House, every member
had the privilege of agreeing or disagreeing with the
amendments made in committee, and of introducing new
clauses into the bill, either upon the report, or the further
consideration of the report, or on the third reading, as is
done in passing public bills; but to prevent inconvenience

on the third reading of any bill, notice thereof shall be

such report, or consideration of the report, or third read

upon the report, or the consideration of the report, or the
third reading of any private bill, such clause or amend
ment is to be referred, on the day on which notice is given
thereof in the Private Bill Office, to the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means; and no clause or amend
ment can be offered in such case to the House, unless it
shall have been so submitted, and unless the chairman of
the committee of ways and means shall have reported
whether the clause or amendment be such as ought or
ought not to be entertained by the House, without referring
the same to the Select Committee on Standing Orders (b).
The clauses so proposed to be inserted must be printed,
and any clause proposed to be amended must be printed
in extenso, with every addition or substitution in different
type, and the omissions therefrom included in brackets (c).
The above form of printing the original clauses, and
marking intended alterations and omissions, greatly
abridges the labour of the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, or the Select Committee on Standing
Orders; their attention being drawn more immediately to
the precise matter referred to them.
If the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
should report to the House that the proposed alterations
may be made in the bill without their being referred to
the Standing Orders’ Committee, they will be at once
adopted; but in case he should report otherwise, they will
be referred to theSelect Committee on Standing Orders(d).
After they shall have been so referred to that com
mittee, no further proceedings can be had until their

Standing Orders must report to the House whether the
proposed clauses or amendments ought to be adopted
without the re-commitment of the bill, and whether they
are of such a nature as to justify the House in entertaining
them without recurring to that tribunal, or of such a
nature as not in either case to be adopted by the house(a);
and also whether such clause or amendment, where pro
posed on the third reading of the bill, ought or ought not
to be adopted by the House at that stage (b).
If the Committee on Standing Orders report that the bill
should be recommitted, it is referred to the original com
mittee. (It may be as well to observe that no bill can be
recommitted subsequently to the third reading.)
No member can sit on a recommitted bill who was not
qualified to serve upon the original committee. It is
usual to have the bill recommitted, with express reference
to special provisions, as otherwise the whole of it would be
open to reconsideration.
As the committee on the bill, after having made its
report, is considered as functus officio, it is necessary, in
order to give jurisdiction, to revive them. For this pur
pose an order of the House is made, “That the committee
be revived, and that they sit on a given day.”
In case of a recommitted bill, three clear days’ notice
in writing must be given by the agent for the bill to the
clerks in the Private Bill Office, of the day and hour
appointed for the meeting of the committee, and all pro

just observed, the whole bill is open to be reconsidered,
unless it be recommitted with express reference to parti
cular provisions only.
After the recommittal of a bill, it has to go through all
the same formalities and the same investigation as before,
and the mode of bringing up the report, &c., having been
hereinbefore minutely described, it will be unnecessary to
repeat it in this place.
Should, however, the Committee on Standing Orders, to
whom a bill is referred, be of opinion that it is not neces
sary to have the bill recommitted, they recommend in
their report whether any and what clauses and amend
ments ought to be adopted by the House.
All amendments allowed by the chairman of the Com
mittee ofWays and Means, or by the Standing Orders’ Com
mittee, or on recommittal, are entered by one of the clerks
in the Private Bill Office upon the printed copy of the bill
as amended in committee, and the clerk must sign such
amended copy in order to its being deposited and pre
served in that office (a).
If no amendments have been suggested, nor any altera
tions made in any of the clauses, or if the suggested
alterations and amendments shall have been allowed or dis
allowed in the report of the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, or of the StandingOrders’Committee, as
the case may be, the House will proceed to the further
consideration of the report. The amendments made in
the committee-room are read, and if the House agrees to
the bill and the amendments, the member having the
charge of it moves, “That the bill, with the amendments,
be engrossed.” The bill is then ordered to be engrossed.
For that purpose a copy of the bill, with all the amend
ments, must be sent to the engrossing office. In order to
insure accuracy in these engrossments, the clerk of the
House is required to provide a sufficient number of clerks
to be examiners of engrossments.

SEC. VII.—Third Reading of the Bill.
AFTER the bill has been reported and the report consi
dered, the next step is the third reading, previous to
which, however, but subsequently to the consideration of
the report, it is necessary for the agent to give to the
clerks in the Private Bill Office one clear day’s notice in
writing of the day proposed for the third reading (a). A
certificate also must be endorsed on the paper bill, and
signed by one or more of the examiners of engrossments,
certifying that the engrossment thereof has been exa
mined, and agrees with the bill as amended in committee.
and on the consideration of the report (b). On the day
appointed for the third reading, the bill, with the certifi
cate endorsed and tied up with the engrossments, is laid
upon the table; the member who has charge of the bill
then moves—l. “That the bill be now read a third time.”
2. “That the bill do now pass, and the title be, &c.”
The opinion of the House is then taken on the whole
bill with the amendments as it stands, and the House is
divided on it. If the “Ayes” are in the majority, the
bill, as far as the Commons are concerned, passes into law
and becomes an Act.
Immediately after it has been read a third time, the
member who had charge of it brings it out of the House,
and the agent takes it to the engrossment office to have
the title endorsed on the engrossment. It is then again
returned to the table, and signed by the chief clerk, pre
paratory to its being carried to the House of Lords.

CHAPTER III.
SEC. I.—Preliminaries to the Introduction of a Bill to the
Upper House.
AFTER a bill has been read a third time in the House of
Commons it is taken up to the House of Lords, where,
with little variation, it undergoes the same investigation
as that to which it was submitted in the Lower House.
When a bill is to be transferred from the Commons to
the Lords, it is entrusted to a member of the House for
that purpose. It is usually sent by the hands of the
member who had charge of it in the Lower House, he
being accompanied by not less than seven other members,
to the bar of the Lords (a), where he delivers the bill to
the Lords’ Speaker, who comes there to receive it.
The preliminaries required to be observed previous to
bringing a bill into the Upper House are, in most cases,
precisely similar to those required before it is introduced
to the House of Commons. Such particulars as can be
ascertained before the presentation of the petition in the
Lower House, and are required, are included in and spe
cified amongst those mentioned in a former part of this
work. Some, however, cannot be known until after the
bill has passed the committee below, and these must be
duly observed before it is submitted to the Lords. Thus,
in respect of alterations made in the plans originally depo
sited, it is ordered by the House of Lords (b), “That
where any alterations shall be made, or desired to be
made, after the introduction of the bill into parliament, in
any work the plans and sections of which shall have been

deposited, and the notices for which shall have been given
in compliance with standing orders, a plan and section of
the alteration, on the same scale, and containing the same
particulars as the original plans, with a book of reference,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the peace of the
county where the alteration is proposed; copies also of
the alterations, so far as the same relate to each parish,
with a book of reference thereto, shall be deposited one
month previously to the introduction of the bill into the
Upper House; and the intention to make the alteration
must be published in the London, Edinburgh, or Dublin
Gazette, as the case may be, and in some one and the
same newspaper of the county where the alteration is
situate, for three successive weeks previously to the intro
duction of the bill into the House; and personal applica
tion, with notice in writing, must be made to the owners,
or reputed owners, lessees or reputed lessees, or, in their
absence from the United Kingdom, to their agents re
spectively, and to the occupiers of land where any altera
tion is intended to be made. The consent of such parties
to the making the alterations must be proved to the satis
faction of the Standing Orders’ Committee.
A map, plan, and section, of such work, showing any
variation, extension, or enlargement, which is intended
to be made in consequence of such alteration, of the same
scale and containing the same particulars as the original
map or plan, and section, must be deposited in the Office
of the Clerk of Parliament (a), before the bill can be intro
duced to the Lords.
Again, if the bill applied for is to empower a company
to execute any work other than that for which it was ori
ginally established, it shall not be allowed to proceed, un
less the Committee on Standing Orders, when such bill is
referred to them, shall have specially reported,—

which are now included in the General Railway Acts of

is granted, and a bill be suffered to be brought in. But

in the House of Lords, the bill, as brought up from the
Commons, is read a first time, as a matter of course, and is
then referred to the Committee on Standing Orders. No
bill relating to a railway is permitted to be read a second
time unless it shall have been referred to the Standing Or
ers’ Committee, before whom compliance with standing
orders must be proved (a).
The Committee on Standing Orders in the Upper House
is formed at the commencement of every session, and con
sists of forty Lords, besides the chairman of the Lords’
committees, who is always chairman of Standing Orders’
Committee (b). Three Lords, including the chairman, are
a quorum (c).
This committee combines in itself the functions both of
the examiner of petitions and that of the Committee on
Standing Orders in the Lower House.
After the bill has been read the first time, and before
the Committee on Standing Orders can take any steps on
it, the agent must deposit in the Office of the Clerk of Par
liament a statement of the length and breadth of the space
which is intended or sought to be taken for the proposed
works, and for the sale of which the consent of the owners
of the land has not been obtained, together with the names
of such owners; and the heights above the surface of all
proposed works on the ground of each such owner; and
also a return shall be presented, at the same time, of the
names of the owners and occupiers of any house situate
within three hundred yards of the proposed works, who
shall have, before the 31st day of December preceding the
introduction of the bill into Parliament, deposited written
objections to the said railway, with any public officer ap
pointed to receive plans of the said railway, within the
parish or township within which their property is situate;
or if the railway be not proposed to be carried through that

township, in the one in which the railway is to pass in the
manner objected to by the above-mentioned parties (a).
Previous to the meeting of the Committee on Standing
Orders, three clear days notice must be given at the Office
of the Clerk of Parliament (b).
A copy of the standing orders of the House must be
transmitted to the committee, together with the bill (c).
Any parties are at liberty to oppose, and be heard by
themselves, their agents, and witnesses, upon any petition
which may be referred to the committee, complaining of
non-compliance with standing orders, provided the matter
complained of be specifically stated in the petition, and
that it be presented on or before the second day after the
introduction of the bill into the Upper House (d). The pe
tition complaining of non-compliance with standing or
ders must be endorsed with the name or short title of the
bill to which the petition relates (e).
Where a company already constituted by Act of Parlia
ment is applying for power to execute any work other than
that for which it was originally established, any proprietor
who dissented at the meeting of proprietors to which the
draft of the proposed bill was submitted, may, on petition
ing the House, be heard by himself, his counsel or agents,
and witnesses (f).
The mode of proceeding before the Standing Orders’
Committee, is almost identical with that before the examiner
of petitions, previous to the introduction of a bill into the
Lower House.
This committee, however, has powers which the one
below does not possess, viz., that of compelling the attend
ance of witnesses, and also of administering an oath pre
vious to examination. No oral evidence will be received

unless the witnesses have been previously sworn at the bar
of the House. Should any witness refuse to appear, the
House issues an order commanding his attendance; and if
he still persist in refusing, he is taken into custody.
The proofs required by this committee are almost the
same as those required by the examiner of petitions.
The service of applications to owners, lessees, and occu
piers of lands, may be proved by the evidence of the agent
or solicitor, unless a petition complaining of the want of
due service of such application shall have been referred to
the committee (a).
Proof is also required of the preliminaries, as before the
examiner of petitions (b).
By a resolution which was incorporated into the stand
ing orders of last session, it was required “That in all
bills introduced into the House for the purpose of establish
ing a company for carrying on any work into which the
name of any person or persons shall be introduced, as m a
nagers, directors, proprietors, or otherwise concerned in
carrying such bill into effect, proof shall be required be
fore the Standing Orders’ Committee that such persons have
subscribed their names to the petition or to a printed copy
of the bill as brought into the House (c).
The committee having heard evidence, are required to
report whether the standing orders have been complied
with; and if they decide that they have not been complied
with, they state the facts upon which their decision is
founded, and any special circumstances connected with the
case, and also their opinion as to the propriety of dispens
ing with any of the standing orders in such case (d).
Should the committee report that the standing orders
have not been observed, but recommend that they be
dispensed with in that particular instance; it remains in
the discretion of the House to decide whether they will
adopt the recommendation of the committee.

If they refuse to adopt it, the bill falls to the ground as
a matter of course. If, on the other hand, the recom
mendation is attended to, the petitioners are reported to
have complied with standing orders, and the bill is ready
for the next stage of the legislative process, namely, the
second reading.
SEC. III.—Second Reading.
BEFoRE the bill is read a second time, copies of the sub
scription contract, with the names of the subscribers ar
ranged in alphabetical order, (or of the declaration and
estimate, in certain cases substituted therefor) printed and
drawn out in the manner hereinbefore mentioned, together
with printed copies of the bill as proposed to be submit
ted (a) to the House, must be deposited at the Office of the
Clerk of Parliament, for the use of the Lords (b).
When the agent for the bill gives notice of the second
reading, he is required by a recent order of the chairman
of committees, to give in to Mr. Adam a written statement
signed by himself, as to whether the railway is a competing
line, and if so, the names of the lines with which it com
petes, and whether it is opposed or not, and the earliest
day upon which the promoters will be ready for the com
mittee on the bill (c.
The preliminaries having been observed, the bill, on the
day appointed, is read a second time. Here, as in the
House below, the second reading affirms the principle of
the bill, which, if it be objectionable, it is competent for
any peer to oppose, by moving, as an amendment, “That
the bill be read a second time this day six months;” upon
which the sense of the House will be taken.

CHAP. III.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 161
If the bill be read the second time, it is immediately
committed, and, if unopposed, it is referred to an open
committee, of which the chairman of the Lords’ committee
(whose duties are similar to those of the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means) is the chairman, together
with any other peers that may be present on the day.
Practically, however, the business in such cases is transacted
by the chairman of the Lords' committee, assisted by the
counsel attached to his office (a).
Although the bill be unopposed, and referred as a mat
ter of course to an open committee, the chairman of the
Lords’ committee may, if he think fit, report to the House
that, in his opinion, it should be proceeded with as an
opposed bill, and thereupon it will be treated as such, and
must pass through a similar investigation before committee
as other opposed bills (b).
Sec. IV.—Committee on the Bill.
PREVIoUs to the sitting of the committee on any opposed
bill, the compliance with standing orders must have been
proved before the Standing Orders’ Committee (c). An op
posed bill is referred to a select committee of five peers,
(nor can it be referred to an open committee) (d), who
choose their own chairman. This committee cannot be
named on the day on which the bill was read a second
time (e).
Any peer having an interest in the bill is exempted from
serving on the select committee. The chairman of com
mittees, and four other Lords named by the House, are
appointed each session as a committee to nominate the

five peers who shall form the select committee on each op

The House appoint a day for the sitting of the com
mittee, which must not be earlier than ten days after the
day of the second reading of the bill.(b) All the five peers
must attend during the whole continuance of the proceed
ings of the committee, nor can any other peer take any
part therein.(c)
The committee meet every morning not later than
eleven, and sit until four o’clock, nor can they adjourn at
an earlier hour without specially reporting the cause of
such adjournment to the House at its next meeting; nor
can they adjourn over any day except Saturday and
Sunday, Christmas Day and Good Friday, without first
obtaining leave of the House. (d)
Should any member of the committee, from illness or
any other cause, be prevented from continuing his attend
ance, the committee must adjourn, and report the cause
of such member absenting himself to the House at its next
meeting. Nor can they resume their sittings without leave
of the House. (e)
The proceedings before the committee on the bill in the
House of Lords, are almost identical with those before the
committee in the Lower House. The petitioners both for
and against the bill are permitted to be heard by them
selves, their counsel, and witnesses, provided the petition
shall have been presented on or before the day on which
the bill was read a second time.(f)
The same parties who would have a locus standi for
opposing a bill below, would also be entitled to oppose it
in this stage. Moreover, it would seem that any proprietor
of a company which is applying for powers to execute
works other than those for which it was originally estab
lished, who by himself, or any other person authorised to

act for him in that behalf, shall have dissented at the
meeting called in pursuance of order 220, sec. 6, may be
heard on petition by himself, his counsel, agent, and
witnesses (a); a privilege that does not appear to have
been given to such dissentient parties in the Lower
House.
Proof of the same particulars in respect of capital, anti
cipated income, engineering difficulties, expenses, and
other circumstances, as required by the Lower House, must
be given before this committee,(b) but they are not em
powered to inquire into the compliance with standing
orders.(c) The House will not proceed with the further
consideration of the report on any bill until it has received
from the committee specific replies to each of the questions
contained in the first part of the 233d order of the House,
unless in cases where there shall be no opposition, or no
parties shall appear in support of a petition against the
bill, or where the opposition shall have been withdrawn;
in either of which events it shall be in the discretion of the
committee to determine how far it may be imperative on
them to inquire into the facts necessary to be proved in
compliance with the above-mentioned order in respect of
railway bills.
Having instituted the usual inquiries, the committee
proceed to draw up their report, which must contain
specific notice of all the particulars required in Part I. of
the 233d standing order.
The report is generally adopted as a matter of course,
as it is seldom that any amendments are offered, either on
the consideration of the report or on the third reading of
the bill.

THE usual practice is when amendments have been made
during the progress of the bill in the Lords’ committee, not
to read it a third time until it has been returned to the
Lower House for their consideration, and the amendments
have been agreed to.
Notice must be given in the Private Bill Office the day be
fore the Lords' amendments are taken into consideration.(a)
If agreed to, they are entered by one of the clerks in
the Private Bill Office upon the bill as amended in
committee, and the copy is signed by the clerk, in order
to its being preserved and deposited in the Private Bill
Office.(b) - -
Should the House of Commons decline to sanction, or
the House of Lords refuse to waive, such amendments, the
bill will be lost for that session. Sometimes the one House
offers amendments upon amendments made by the other,
whereupon the two Houses come to an arrangement. But
it must be understood as a general rule that neither House
may, at this time, leave out or otherwise alter any thing
which they themselves have already passed, unless the
subsequent alteration or omission be immediately con
sequent upon amendments of the other House, which have
been agreed to, and such as is absolutely necessary for
carrying the amendments so sanctioned into effect.
Where amendments have been made in committee, the
bill as amended must be printed for the use of the House
previous to the third reading, unless the chairman of the
committee certify that it is unnecessary.(c)
Copies of the bill must also be deposited three days
before the third reading with the commissioners of

CHAP. 111.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 165
Before a railway bill can be read a third time in the
House of Lords, provision must be made therein, restrict
ing the company from raising by loan or mortgage a larger
sum than one third of their capital, limiting the alteration
of the level of turnpike roads to one in thirty, and of other
roads to one in twenty, and prohibiting the railway from
crossing highways on the same level, unless the committee
report that such restrictions ought not to be enforced, and
limiting the time for the completion of the work.(a)
These particulars are most of them provided for in the
general railway acts, which are now incorporated in every b
special act.
On the question being put that the bill be read a third
time, if the “ayes” have a majority the bill is passed, and
is ready to receive the royal assent.
SEC. VI.—Royal Assent.
THE two Houses having agreed upon the various amend
ments, and the bill having been read a third time in the
Lords (being in the nature of a money bill), it is returned
to the Commons before the royal assent is given, where it
remains until several have accumulated, when notice is
given to the lord chancellor that a commission is wanted.
In the case of railway bills the royal assent is never given
in person (unless they chance to be ready when her Majesty
attends to prorogue Parliament), as that would delay their
passing until the end of the session, and be productive of
other inconveniences.
The clerks of the House of Lords have power to stop all
bills from receiving the royal assent upon which the fees
of both houses of Parliament have not been paid, and thus
to delay indefinitely their finally passing, unless these
claims be satisfied.

CHAPTER IV.
PARLIAMENTARY FEEs AND AGENTs’ AND solicitoRs BILLs.
SEC. I.—Parliamentary Fees.
BEFoRE concluding this book it is requisite to make a
few remarks as to the parliamentary fees, the non-payment
of which may postpone or prevent the final passing of the
meaSure.
The scale of fees payable in the House of Commons to
the speaker, his secretary, the serjeant, the doorkeeper,
housekeepers, messengers, and others, together with the
charges for engrossments, copies, orders, affidavits, attend
ance of committee clerks, and the charges to be made in
the Private Bill Office, are to be found in the copies of the
standing orders, as published by the authority of the
House.
The scale of fees in the House of Lords can be obtained
from the Office of the Clerk of Parliament.
For information as to the appropriation of parlia
mentary fees, the reader is referred to the 52d Geo. III.
c. 11. The agent for the bill is primarily liable for the
payment of those charges, he having his remedy against
the petitioners.
SEC. II.—Agents’ and Solicitors’ Bills.
WITH regard to the demands to be made by parliamentary
agents and others soliciting bills in Parliament, and for the
purpose of checking exorbitant charges, and also for facili
tating the recovery of the amount of their bills, an act was
passed (6th Geo. IV. c. 123) authorising the taxing of
such bills, and giving a more summary remedy for the
CHAP. Iv.] IN CORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 167
recovery of the amount after taxation. This statute only
applies to costs and charges incurred in the House of
Commons; but shortly afterwards another act (the 7th
and 8th Geo. IV. c. 64) was passed to effect the same
object in respect of the costs incurred in the House of
Lords.
The earlier of the above statutes enacts that if any
petitioner for or against a private bill brought into the
House of Commons, shall make application to the Speaker
of the house, complaining of the costs and charges made
by any parliamentary agent or solicitor, or any person
employed in soliciting or preparing a bill, or in com
plying with standing orders relative thereto, on behalf
of such petitioner; the Speaker is authorised and required
to direct that the costs and charges, so far as the same
relate to the House of Commons, shall be taxed by such
persons as the speaker may appoint.
The taxing officer appointed by the Speaker is required
to tax the bill submitted to him, and report to the
Speaker the amount of such costs and charges which he
shall think fit to be allowed after taxation; and any person
interested will, on application to the Speaker, be entitled
to a certificate, signed by him, of the amount of costs so
to be allowed; such certificate to be conclusive evidence
of all demands therein certified, and the receipt of the
agent or solicitor receiving such amount (to be drawn at
the foot of the certificate) will be a sufficient discharge for
such costs and expenses.(a)
These provisions merely give a remedy to the petitioner
or other party charged with costs; but the same section of
that statute facilitates the mode of recovering such costs
and charges by the agent or solicitor, and enacts that any
agent or solicitor complaining that he is aggrieved by the
non-payment of costs and charges in respect of any private
bill, may have the costs taxed and a certificate issued; in
which case, should the party liable refuse to pay the costs

so certified by the Speaker, and any action be commenced
thereon, the certificate given by the Speaker shall have the
force and effect of a warrant to confess judgment; and the
court in which such action shall have been commenced
shall, upon motion and production of such certificate, or
der judgment to be entered up for the sum specified in
the certificate, in the same manner as if the defendant
had signed a warrant to confess judgment to that amount.
The advantages of these provisions are that whilst, on
the one hand, they do not preclude an agent or solicitor
from his remedy at common law, but only facilitate his
mode of recovery after action brought; on the other hand,
should an action be brought by such agent or solicitor,
the payment or tender of the amount certified by the
speaker's taxing officer, together with costs, if any, incurred
up to the time of payment or tender, will be sufficient to
stay all further proceedings.
A parliamentary agent does not come within the provi
sions of the 6 and 7 Vic. c. 73, as to the delivery of a bill
signed by him a month previous to commencing any action
thereon; and it is not altogether clear whether the bill of
a solicitor employed in soliciting a bill in Parliament is
affected by the above statute, where the charges are made
in respect of services rendered partly parliamentary, partly
otherwise.
At all events, the power of taxation given by the 6th
Geo. IV. c. 123, to the Speaker of the House of Commons,
relates only to business done in soliciting a bill in that
House. The words of the 6 and 7 Vic. c. 73, s. 37, seem,
however, sufficient to comprise all professional business
done by a solicitor; and such portions ofthe bill, therefore,
as would not be taxable under the 6th Geo. IV. c. 143, by
the taxing officer of the House, may be taxed by order of
the Master of the Rolls, or the Lord Chancellor (a).
(a) Since the above was written we understand that taxing orders have been
obtained as mentioned for business done in relation to a proposed bill in Par
liament, but which would not have been taxable as parliamentary business by
the taxing officer of the House of Commons.
CHAP. II.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 169
The taxing officer appointed by the Speaker is authorized
to demand and receive for taxation such fees as are fixed
from time to time by the resolutions of the House of Com
mons, and to charge the same at the foot of the report,
either against the party applying for the taxation or the
party complained of, or against both, in such proportions
as he may think fit; consequently the question of costs of
taxation is entirely under the control and within the dis
cretion of the taxing officer; there being no rule, as in the
taxation of costs at Common Law, or in Equity, regulating
the infliction of the costs on the solicitor or the client, as
the bill might be reduced, or not a given amount on taxa
tion.
The statute that was passed for the purpose of taxing
bills of costs incurred in carrying bills through the House
of Lords, namely, the 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 64, contains
provisions similar to those of the 6th Geo. IV. c. 123, with
this distinction: that the taxing officer is appointed by the
Clerk of Parliament instead of the Speaker; and that the
officer so appointed has power to administer oaths to any
parties appearing before him in support of the bill of costs,
or in opposition thereto, touching the matters relating to
it; and to require the production of proper vouchers for
all monies charged as having been paid by any parlia
mentary agent in the soliciting or opposing such private
bill.
With the exception of the above power of administering
oaths, all the other powers are the same; and the certifi
cate granted by the Clerk of Parliament is of the same
effect as that granted by the Speaker of the House of Com
In1011S. -
There is, however, this material distinction between the
two statutes under consideration: that the latter is framed
so as expressly to include bills of costs incurred in opposing
as well as soliciting bills in Parliament; whereas, in the
former, the terms employed would seem to indicate that
no remedy under the statute was intended to be given

*
where the charges sought to be recovered were for oppos
ing or seeking to modify any private bill.
The scale of fees appended to the standing orders of the
House of Commons is, nevertheless, found to include the
latter; and as the House has thus recognized the claim,
and regulated the demands of persons employed to oppose
or modify a bill, it would seem natural to infer that the
statute, giving a more facile remedy for the taxation and
recovery of costs incurred for parliamentary business, was
designed to apply as well to the opposing petitioners and
their agents, as to those soliciting the bill (a).
(a) Where the bill of a solicitor for parliamentary business, partly in support
of one bill and partly in opposition to others, was referred to the taxing offi
cers appointed by the Speaker, they declined taxing those portions of the bill
relating to opposing the bill in Parliament, on the ground that the statute gave
them no jurisdiction. It would seem, however, that under the recent statute of
the 6 and 7 Victoria, the Lord Chancellor or the Master of the Rolls would
grant a supplemental order under which the other items of the bill would be
taxable as in ordinary cases.
BOOK III.-FORMATION OF THE LINE.
WE shall treat, in this book, of all matters relating, more Division of the
or less directly, to the construction of the railway, classi- *
fying them under three general divisions: first, the pur
chase and taking of lands; secondly, the rights acquired
by a company, under the special and general railway acts,
over property not purchased; and, thirdly, matters con
nected with the execution of the works. Our first divi
sion, the purchase and taking of lands, will include a con
sideration of what lands may be taken; what parties may
claim compensation, and for what injuries; the mode of
purchasing lands by agreement, with the parties to the
contract and the form of it; the consideration of it, and its
effect and force; the purchase of lands otherwise than by
agreement, comprising the mode of settling cases of dis
puted compensation, by justices, arbitration, or a jury; and
assessment thereofwhere parties are absent from the king
dom, or cannot be found. This will be followed by a sec
tion on the mode of paying the amount of compensation
to parties variously circumstanced, as commoners, or per
sons under disability, or not absolutely entitled, or refus
ing to convey, or unable to make out title, or who cannot
be found. We shall then proceed to the consideration of
conveyances, both in ordinary cases and where parties are
unable, or neglect, or refuse to convey. Entry on the
lands purchased will next claim our attention, with the
times at which such entry may be made in different cases;
and the penalties incurred by, and the remedies given for,
N 2
172 RAILWAY COMPANIES, [Book III.
a premature or wrongful entry by the company. We shall
then treat of the special proceedings necessary to be taken
in respect of lands subject to public, quasi-public, or pe
culiar rights and burdens, as copyholds, common lands,
and lands subject to land-tax, and poor's-rate; and also
of those subject to private rights and burdens, as lands
in mortgage, subject to rent-charge, or held under lease;
and shall conclude this general division by noticing the
statutory provisions contained in the Lands’ Clauses Act,
respecting the interests in lands accidentally omitted to
be purchased, with the mode of remedying the consequences
of the error; and the sale of superfluous lands in the pos
session of the company after the works are completed.
In our chapter on the rights of a railway company over
property not purchased, we shall devote thefirst section to
a consideration of their right to make a temporary use of
such property; either for the purpose of surveying and
mapping it, or during the construction of the line, or to
prevent or repair accidents, and of the temporary user of
public and private roads by the company. The second
section will treat of the right to make permanent altera
tions in the property not purchased; comprising a notice of
the preliminaries to an entry thereon, the conditions and
mode of using it, and the compensation to be given to the
owners, with the remedies provided between the parties.
The third section will give the instances in which the com
pany may vary and restrict the rights of third parties over
their property, as in the case of minerals; the conditions
and limits under and within which the owner may work
the same; the rights of the company to inspect them and
adopt measures for the safety of the railway; and the com
pensation to be paid to the proprietors for these inter
ferences with the ordinary rights of ownership.
The third chapter, on the execution of the works, will
divide itself into the following sections: treating first of
the general powers and restrictions imposed on a com
pany in the construction of their line; secondly, of
BOOK. III.] FORMATION OF THE COMPANY. 173
deviations from the plans of the proposed railway, whe
ther in respect of the level or the line thereof, or in respect
of tunnels and viaducts; thirdly, of the subject of crossing
and diverting turnpike and other roads, whether on a level
or otherwise, including a consideration of all requisite no
tices and proceedings, the providing of sufficient substituted
roads, the construction, maintenance, and repair of bridges
and viaducts, with all their several fences and approaches,
and the inclination of the roads over or under them;
fourthly, of the nature and extent of the accommodation
works to be provided by the company for the owners of
adjoining lands, with the time within which they must be
made, and the settlement of all disputes in respect thereof;
fifthly, of branch railways—their construction and user;
sixthly, of the provisions of the Railways’ Clauses Act, re
lating to the drainage of lands in Ireland; and seventhly
and lastly, ofsuch miscellaneous matters connected with the
execution of the works as did not fall properly under any
of the foregoing divisions, such as the obligation of the
company to construct and maintain the line of railway
throughout, the setting up of mile-stones, the establish
ment and uses of electrical telegraphs, the provisions of
the 9 and 10 Vic. c. 57 as to the guage of railroads; and,
lastly, the penalty imposed by the Railways’ Clauses Act
on persons obstructing the construction of the railway.
These various topics will be noticed in the order of their
enumeration; and the treatment of them will, it is hoped,
be found to comprise a consideration of every question of
difficulty or importance which can arise between the com
pany and third parties, in relation to the purchase of land
or the formation of the railroad.

CHAPTER I.
PURCHASE AND TAKING OF LANDS.
BY the 6th section of the Railway Clauses Consolidation
Act, (8 Vic., c. 20,) it is enacted, “that in exercising the
power given to the company by the special Act to con
struct the railway, and to take lands for that purpose, the
company shall be subject to the provisions and restric
tions contained in this Act and in the Lands’ Clauses Con
solidation Act; and the company shall make to the owners
and occupiers of, and all other parties interested in, any
lands to be taken or used for the purposes of the railway,
or injuriously affected by the construction thereof, full
compensation for the value of the lands so taken or used,
and for all damage sustained by such owners, occupiers,
and other parties, by reason of the exercise, (as regards
such lands,) of the powers by this or the special Act, or
any Act incorporated therewith, vested in the company;
and, except where otherwise provided by this or the special
Act, the amount of such compensation shall be ascertained
or determined in the manner provided by the said Lands’
Clauses Consolidation Act for determining questions of
compensation with regard to lands purchased or taken
under the provisions thereof; and all the provisions of the
said last mentioned Act shall be applicable to determining
the amount of any such compensation, and to enforcing
the payment or other satisfaction thereof.”
The extraordinary powers conferred by Parliament upon
railway companies, unknown at Common Law, are so great
and numerous that they will be watched with the utmost
vigilance and jealousy, and construed by the Courts with
a leaning against those for whose advantage they have
CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 175
been conferred, and in favour of those whose private rights
and properties are liable to invasion by the exercise of
them.
Thus, speaking on this subject, Lord Cottenham says(a),
“It is extremely important to watch over the interests of
those whose property is affected by these companies, to
take care that the company shall not be permitted to
exercise powers beyond those which the Act of Parliament
gives them. The powers given to these companies are so
large, and frequently so injurious to the interests of indi
viduals, that I think it is the duty of every court to keep
them most strictly within those powers; and if there be
any reasonable doubt as to the extent of their powers,
they must go elsewhere and get enlarged powers: but
they will get none from me by way of construction of the
Act.” Acts of Incorporation will therefore be construed
strictly as against the company. Hence, where the lan
guage of an Act of Parliament obtained by a company for
imposing a rate or toll upon the public is ambiguous, or
will admit of different meanings, that construction is to be
adopted which is most favourable to the public (b).
In Priestley v. Foulds (c), Mr. J. Maule says, “Such a
reasonable rule of construction ought to be put upon the
words of this Act, (the Act empowering the company,) as
is by Lord Tenterden, C. J., in the Stourbridge Canal
Company v. Wheeley (d), that ‘any ambiguity in the terms
of a contract must operate against the adventurers, and in
favour of the public; and the plaintiffs can claim nothing
which is not clearly given to them by the Act.’” (e) These

words seem to convey an intimation, on the part of the
learned Chief Justice, that these statutes for the incorpo
ration of companies are to be treated as contracts between
the company and the public, the terms of which the mem
bers of the respective companies have themselves prescribed,
and which are therefore to be interpreted on the same prin
ciples as ordinary contracts; that is, against the contracting
party. This view is further illustrated and confirmed by the
judgment of the Court in the case of Parker v. the Great
Western Railway Company (a), in which it was laid down
that the language of the Act is supposed to be the lan
guage of the promoters of it, who ask the legislature to
give them certain great privileges, and profess to give the
public certain advantages in return.
The Courts, however, though jealous in protecting indi
vidual rights and private interests against the encroach
ments of companies armed with unusual powers, will
nevertheless be careful not to assist persons who may seek
to avail themselves of some accidental omission in the Act,
for the purpose of extortion. In such a case, any legal
right or remedy accruing to a party would be respected
and enforced by the courts; but no equitable or discre
tionary aid would be afforded to a plaintiff in support of a
claim so originated. He would be left to the strict vindi
cation of his own rights by the strictest process of the
law (b).
The powers conferred on the company in the statute of
incorporation are not only to be modified by the provi
sions contained in the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act
and the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, but will be
influenced also by those agreements which the company
has made with third parties before obtaining the Act.
Such agreements will operate as restrictions on the rights

CHAP. 1.] FORMATION Of THE LINE. 177
and powers conferred by the legislature, and the Courts
will enforce them wherever the contract has been duly
entered into.
Therefore, where certain restrictive clauses, proposed by
the trustees of a road to be introduced into a railway bill
pending in Parliament, were withdrawn on the substance
of them having been embodied in an agreement entered
into between the trustees and the company; the Court of
Chancery decreed that the company could not exercise
the powers given by their Act in violation of the terms of
that agreement (a).
Nor will it make any difference, though the party con
tracting with the promoters for withdrawing opposition,
for the purchase of land, or otherwise, were a peer or mem
ber of parliament (b).
The effect of the agreements under consideration is fur
ther illustrated by the following case, in which the con
tracts of one company were held binding upon another,
under the circumstances disclosed in the pleadings. An
agreement to purchase certain lands (c) of the plaintiff
had been entered into by the promoters of an intended
railway company, and thereupon the plaintiff withdrew
his opposition to their proposed bill in Parliament. The
promoters of a competing railway company, who also pro
posed to pass through the plaintiff’s lands, and to which
he was likewise opposed; petitioned Parliament for a bill,
and, under the direction of a committee of the House of
Commons, the merits of the respective lines were referred
to arbitration. The two companies agreed that the suc
cessful should adopt the engagements of the rejected

company, and to this agreement the plaintiff, by his
agent, assented. The award of the arbitrators being in
favour of the second company, their bill passed, and it
was held by the Vice-Chancellor, and by the Lord Chan
cellor, affirming his Honour’s decision, that the plaintiff
having, on the faith of the agreement between the two
companies, offered no opposition to the passing of the Act,
the second company, as the condition of entering upon
the lands of the plaintiff, were bound by the terms of the
agreement between the plaintiff and the first company.
The Courts, however, will not interfere, by injunction or
otherwise, with the exercise of the powers conferred by a
railway Act upon the company, unless a clear contract be
made out, whereby the plaintiff surrendered some rights
or advantages which he possessed, and the company
received the benefit of that surrender, and afterwards
refused to perform their part of the undertaking. There
fore, where an owner of land in the proposed line of the
railway, refrained from opposing the bill, in consequence
of an expectation, (arising from some statement of an
agent of the company,) that a certain portion of his land
which was afterwards taken would not be required, but
did not so act as to preclude himself from opposing it, and
was treated as a dissentient landowner by the company;
the Court held that he had no equity against the company
to prevent their entering on the land in question, they
having received no consideration for the representation of
their agent which led to the plaintiff’s mistake (a). So,
where the plaintiffs, after introducing restrictive clauses
into a railway bill, continued their opposition up to the
moment of its passing; the Court held that those clauses
had not the effect of a contract between the company and
their opponents, and therefore that if they were found

CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 179
inadequate to secure the objects desired by those who
introduced them, still no equity existed against the com
pany, who could not be enjoined from exercising fully the
powers conferred by the Act (a).
Nor will a qualified assent to the proposed bill, on terms
which are neither embodied in an agreement, nor adopted
by the legislature, afford equitable grounds for restrain
ing a company from exercising the powers conferred by
their Act; as where the trustees of a turnpike road agreed
to assent to a Railway Bill before Parliament, on condition
that the line of railway should pass over the road at a
certain elevation ; and this assent was returned in both
Houses of Parliament, and the bill passed, but no proviso
as to the road in question, nor were the terms of the assent
embodied in any agreement between the trustees and the
company; it was held that such qualified assent could
not in any way modify the powers conferred by the
Act (b).
So it has been decided, (c) that a mere undertaking
in Chancery has not the same effect as a contract with
third parties on the future powers of the company, so
as to control the provisions of the Act of Parliament. Nor
will it restrain the company from petitioning Parliament
for a bill, although in violation of the undertaking entered
into by them with the Court of Chancery.
Where a contract has been entered into between a land
owner and a railway company before incorporation for the
purchase by the latter of certain lands, which the Act gives
them no power to hold, it may become a question how far
the powers actually conferred are modified, or the exercise
of them is restrained, by the terms of such contract. An
agreement to sell land and withdraw opposition has, in

one instance, been held binding, although eventually the
land contracted to be sold was not required for the pur
poses of the undertaking. (a) But there is no case in
which a company has been restrained from exercising the
general powers conferred by their Act until such an agree
ment has been specifically performed. In another case,
where this point arose incidentally, the Court intimated a
strong doubt whether specific performance of such a con
tract would be decreed. (b) It would seem, therefore, that
no injunction would be granted under such circumstances,
restraining the Company from going on with their works,
but that the party would be left to any remedy at law to
which he might be entitled.
Notices to Owners of Lands.
When the company require to purchase or take any
of the lands which they are authorised to purchase or take;
they must give notice thereof to all the parties interested
in such lands, or to the parties enabled by the Railway Acts
to sell, convey, or release the same, or to such of them as
shall, after diligent inquiry, be known to the promoters;
requiring such parties within a certain time to give in full
particulars of their estates and interest in the lands re
quired, and of the claims made by them in respect
thereof(c). -
The term “parties interested” is not confined to the
owner of the inheritance, but must be construed to mean
any person who has any estate or interest likely to be
injured. Thus, a tenant, whether from year to year,
(a) See Simpson v. Ld. Howden, 1 Rail. Ca. 326; Same v. Same, 10 A. and

(e) 8 Vict. c. 18. sec. 18.

or for a term of years, or for lives, is entitled to notice.(a)
So one who has merely an easement (b) over the land re
quired, is also to be served with notice, although his right
to compensation does not accrue until an injury is actually
inflicted; and, in general, the required notice must be
served on all parties, whether they claim an absolute or only
a particular interest, either in their own right or in a repre
sentative capacity, as guardians, committees of lunatics and
idiots, trustees, feoffees, and the like. It would appear that
notices need only be served on those parties whose lands
have been included in the schedule and books of reference,
and for such lands as are required for the purposes of the
undertaking, and not upon those whose property is not
included therein, although such property is likely to be
physically injured by the execution of the works. In the
latter case it seems to be the duty of the owner of the
land, or the party suffering the injury, to take the initia
tive, by serving a notice on the company, requiring com
pensation (c).
In the case of private individuals, the notice must either
be served on the parties personally, or left at their last
usual place of abode, if it can be found; if not, on the
occupier; or, if no occupier, it must be affixed to some
conspicuous part of the land (d). In the case of property
belonging to corporations aggregate, it must be served at
the office, or, if there be no office, on some principal
member of such corporation, and also on the occupiers, if
any; or, if not, it must be affixed to the premises (e).
The notice to treat for the purchase of any interest in
lands must contain such a description of the property pro
posed to be taken as shall be sufficient for the information

of the party served therewith, so as to enable him to
make a proper demand (a). It must also include an offer,
on the part of the promoters, to negotiate for the purchase
thereof, and to make compensation for any damage that
may be sustained (b); and any proceedings taken in pur
suance of a notice containing no such offer may be treated
as a nullity.
A very scrupulous exactness of phrase will not be re
quired, provided the information afforded by the notice be
sufficiently precise to enable a person of ordinary capacity
to ascertain its meaning and purport (c). It is usual to
send with the motice a plan of the property in question,
with the line of railway and the land required marked in
different colours. Great care should be taken in the
drawing up of the notice, as the company will be bound
by the terms of it (d).
The exact quantity of land required should be distinctly
specified, as, after service of notice, it is doubtful whether
the company will not be precluded from demanding more
or contracting for less. It has not yet, however, been
absolutely decided whether the powers of the company
under their Act are exhausted by the service of a notice,
so far as relates to lands belonging to the same party,
situate in the same place; and whether, supposing the
company had issued a notice to treat for the purchase of
certain property, and should afterwards find that they
required more, they could issue a second notice for the
additional land. Judging from the language held by Lord
Cottenham, C., in the case of Stone and others v. the
Commercial Railway Company (e), where the company,

CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 183
having given notice to the landowner for the purchase of
a certain quantity of land, afterwards issued their precept
to the sheriff for the assessment of a smaller quantity; we
may conclude that a second notice to treat for additional
lands could not be given after proceedings had been taken
on the first. His Lordship says, “The Act requires that
this step (the issuing of a precept to the sheriff) shall be
preceded by a previous notice of what is to be the subject
matter of inquiry before the jury; but the jury notice
comprises a fraction only of that which is comprehended
in the previous notice; and if I were to consider this as
within the provisions of the Act, it would be in the power
of the company, having given notice for any portion of
property, to subdivide that into as many proceedings
before the sheriff as they might think fit. Having given
notice for one hundred yards of land, they might have a
separate jury process for each yard. There is nothing to
prevent it if it be in the discretion of the company so to
subdivide their contract, and to ask the opinion of the
jury upon each particular portion of the land which they
propose to take.” For reasons similar to these we may
perhaps infer that where a company, having an option as
to the lands mentioned in their schedule and books of
reference, have exercised that option by giving a notice to
take a certain quantity, (a) they will not afterwards be
permitted to serve a second notice for further lands; for
if so, the evils pointed out by Lord Cottenham as likely to
arise from a want of conformity, as regards quantity of
land, between the precept to the sheriff and the notice to
the landowner, might be produced by these repeated
notices in respect of different portions of property; and
the company might subdivide the contract for the land
into as many separate notices and assessments as they
might deem advantageous, to the great annoyance and
injury of the owners, and in defiance of the spirit of the
railway Acts.
(a) Rex v. the Hungerford Mar. Com., 1 Nev. & M. 112; 4 B. & Ad. 327.
184 RAILWAY COMPANIES, [Book III.
(3) Effect of.
Moreover, the right of the company to take the lands
arises exclusively under the Acts, and if it be regarded as
in any respect analogous to a power conferred on an indi
vidual by deed or will, it may perhaps become a question
whether proceedings taken in pursuance of a notice once
served is not, so far as respects the property of that land
owner in that locality, such an exercise of the right as
exhausts the powers of the company.
The service of notice to treat for lands is considered, as
we have seen, a determining of the option which up to
that time the company had as to the purchase of the lands
mentioned in the schedule to the Act. Hence, on granting
a mandamus, compelling a company to summon a jury to
assess the value of the lands included in their notice, Mr.
Baron Parke said, “The company are not bound to pur
chase property mentioned in the schedule; but the ques
tion is, at what period they shall be said to have exercised
their option. Now I think that is done when they have
given notice, and that, according to reason and good
sense, such notice ought to be as binding on them as on
the owner or occupier (a).
The serving of the notice has also been decided to be an
act establishing the relation of vendor and purchaser be
tween the company and the owners or occupiers of the
lands therein mentioned, and to preclude the company
from varying the terms of the contract, by taking a smaller
quantity of land than that for which they had given
notice (b).

CHAP, I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 185
SEC. I.—What Lands may be taken.
A RAILwAY company is empowered by its Act of Incor
poration taken in connection with the generalRailwayActs,
to purchase and hold lands. Such power, however, is limited
to the quantity of land necessary for the formation of the
line, and such other, (not exceeding, in the whole, the
prescribed number of acres,) as may be necessary for
extraordinary purposes; nor can the company take or hold
more, whether they acquire possession of it by agreement
with the owners, or under the compulsory powers with
which they are endowed. There seems, however, to be
this distinction between their obtaining possession of lands
by private agreement, and under the compulsory powers of
the Act; that in the former case the company may purchase,
any lands within the limits of deviation, and not exceeding
the quantity allowed to be taken for extraordinary pur
poses, whether such lands have been included in the plans
and books of reference or not; whilst in the latter, they
cannot obtain possession of any lands, whether for extra
ordinary purposes, or for the construction of the line,
except such lands shall have been inserted in the plans
and books of reference (a). -
Where lands are the property of private individuals,
public companies, corporations, or any body of persons,
(other than lands under the jurisdiction of the Admiralty,
or belonging to a municipal corporation,) the promoters
of the undertaking can, either by private agreement, or
under the compulsory powers given by their Special Act,
in conjunction with the provisions of the public railway
Acts, obtain possession of so much of them as may be
required for the line, and which they are authorised by
their Special Act to take.
Where the lands in question belong to any municipal

corporation, the promoters cannot, either by private
agreement, or under the compulsory powers of the Act,
obtain such lands without the approbation of the Commis
sioners of her Majesty’s Treasury (a).
If the lands required are on the shore of the sea, or
of any creek, bay, arm of the sea, or navigable river com
municating therewith, where the tide flows and reflows,
then the permission of her Majesty must be obtained, sig
nified in writing under the hands of two of the Commis
sioners of the Woods and Forests, and of the Commissioners
for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, and also
under the hand of the Secretary of the Admiralty. In
such cases the company can only take the land sub
ject to any restrictions in the mode of executing the
works imposed by such Commissioners of the Woods
and Forests, and by the Lords of the Admiralty (b).
In the instance of lands belonging to the Crown, no
provision is made in any of the Acts as to the mode of
dealing with them; but the Commissioners of the Woods
and Forests generally impose terms on the promoters pre
vious to their going into Parliament, requiring them to
give security to use the lands in such manner as the com
missioners may prescribe, should the Act be eventually
obtained.
In addition to the lands which the promoters of a rail
way company shall be authorised to take under their com
pulsory powers, they may contract with any party willing
to sell the same, for the purchase of any land adjoining
or near to the railway, not exceeding in the whole the
prescribed number of acres for extraordinary purposes;
(that is to say), For the purpose of making and providing
additional stations, yards, wharfs, and places for the
accommodation of passengers, and for receiving, depo
siting, and loading or unloading goods or cattle to be con
veyed upon the railway, and for the erection of any weigh

ing machines, toll-houses, offices, warehouses, and other
buildings and conveniences; for the purpose of making
convenient roads or ways to the railway, or any other pur
pose which may be requisite or convenient for the forma
tion or use of the railway.
The quantity of additional land which the company
are hereby authorised to purchase of a party willing to
sell is usually determined by a clause of the Special
Act, and varies according to the circumstances of each
case (a).
Besides the lands which a company may thus take for
the line, and for extraordinary purposes, they may, in cer
tain cases compel, or be compelled by, the owner of pro
perty intersected; when there is left on either side less
than half a statute acre, or a piece worth a less sum than
it would cost to make a bridge, culvert, or other commu
nication; to sell or purchase such land in the place of
making a communication, unless the owner have other land
adjoining (b).
So the promoters cannot require the owner of any
house, building, or factory, to sell a part thereof, if he
be willing and able to sell and convey the whole (c).
It was formerly usual in Special Railway Acts to in
troduce a clause giving to the owners of property, which,
though not taken nor directly interfered with by the com
pany, was situated within a certain specified distance of
the line, power to require the company to purchase the
same. No such provision, however, is made in the gene
ral railway Acts, but parties having property injuriously
affected by the execution of the works are left to the
remedies given by the ordinary compensation clauses.
Upon the construction of such section in a Special Act,
the Court held that though a part only of the building in

was entitled to require the company to purchase the
whole (a).
But where it was enacted, that the company should not
be empowered to take or use less than the whole of any

tory, it was held that the word “yard” did not include a

SEc. II.—What Parties may claim Compensation, and for
what Injuries.
THE Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 8 & 9 Vict, c.
20, s. 6, enacts, “That the company shall make to the
owners and occupiers of, and all other parties interested
in, any lands taken or used for the purposes of the rail
way, or injuriously affected by the construction thereof,
full compensation for the lands taken and used, and for
all damage sustained by the owners and occupiers, and
other parties, by reason of the construction of the rail
way.” The above general words provide compensation for
every interest injuriously affected, whether permanently,
or for a time only, by the execution of the works; and
whether the injury be done by the absolute taking of pro
perty specified in the plans and books of reference for the
purpose of the line, or of lands which, though not men
tioned therein, are yet injured by reason of their con
tiguity to the railway.

Clauses giving compensation to parties injured by the
execution of public works will be liberally construed.
Lord Denman speaking on this subject says (a), “When
such large powers are entrusted to a company, to carry
their works into execution without the consent of the
owners and occupiers of the land, it is reasonable and
just, that any injury to property which can be shown to
arise from the prosecution of those works should be fairly
compensated for to the party sustaining it. Where the
intention to give compensation has been clearly expressed,
every fair intendment ought to be given to effectuate that
intention.”
In the first place we must consider the parties entitled
to demand compensation, and the nature of the interest
in the lands affected which will justify the claim. And,
in the second place, what injuries are to be considered as
the subjects of compensation.
Any person having a present interest in lands required
for, or injuriously affected by, the construction of the
line, is entitled to compensation in respect of that inte
rest; whether he claim as absolute owner of the fee, or as
owner of a rent charge, or as owner of manorial rights, or
as a tenant for life, or in tail, or for a term of years, or
only from year to year. A lessee not producing his lease,
or the best evidence thereof, will be treated as a tenant
from year to year (b). Such parties will be entitled to
compensation, not only for the lands in their possession
actually taken, but for the inconvenience they sustain in
respect of the severance of their other lands by the con
struction of the line.
So compensation may be demanded, though the claim
ant be entitled merely to an easement in the land, as a
right of common, right of road, privilege of ancient lights,
or other incorporeal hereditament.

enabled to recover, compensation for damages (a).
But, where titheable land had been taken by a com
pany under compulsory powers, and covered with water,
the tithe-owner was held not entitled to compensation as
a party interested therein (b). Now, however, where
lands subject to a tithe-rent charge are taken by a
railway company, the lands so taken continue to be
subject to the charge, and a special remedy for the
recovery of it, when in arrear, is provided by 7 & 8
Vict. c. 85, s. 22.
The compensation to be given for lands taken for, or
injuriously affected by, the execution of railway works, is
generally payable to two classes of persons in respect
thereof; first, to those who have the right of property
therein; and, secondly, to those who have the right of
possession. - -
As to the first class, this compensation for the property
in the land is not assessed in respect of each particular
estate or interest therein, but in respect of the land itself.
Thus the recompense for damage to an estate is not
divided among the various interests, as so much to tenant
for life, and so much to remainder-man, or reversioner;
but is awarded, generally, in respect of the present
enjoyment of the land, or of the rents and profits. Where
the land is settled to particular uses, and could not be sold
except under the powers conferred by the Lands Clauses
Act, the amount of compensation must be settled to the
same uses under the direction of the Court of Chan
cery (c).

party in actual occupation of the land will be entitled to
such an amount as is proportioned to the nature and
extent of the injury which he suffers, whether as tenant
for a term, or from year to year.
It may be as well in this place to remark, with regard
to the amount of compensation to be paid to mere tenants
at will or from year to year, that they are only entitled to
compensation in respect of the determination of their
interest before the time that it would expire by a regular
notice from the landlord (a). For this purpose, the com
pany are put in the place of the landlord, and may compe
the tenant, by their notice, expiring with the current year
of the tenancy, to give up the premises without payment
of any compensation, other than perhaps for fixtures or
other articles, for which the party ejected would have been
entitled to compensation, either from an incoming tenant
or his landlord. But though a party is entitled to com
pensation for any absolute legal interest which he has in
the lands required, he cannot claim compensation for any
mere expectancy. Thus a lessee who makes improve
ments in the property, under an expectation of the
renewal of his lease, is not entitled to be compensated by
a company; nor a tenant from year to year who is ejected,
having no reason to expect that his landlord would disturb
him (b).
The damage to lands may be either permanent, or tem
porary and continuing only during the period of the con
struction of the line. So it may be either immediate or
consequential. When the lands are absolutely taken for
the line, and other lands belonging to the same owner,
although not specified in the plans and books of reference,
suffer damage by severance, or from other causes, the
injury is immediate, and there is no difficulty in ascer

taining the measure of damage. Or should the property
be required for temporary purposes only, in such case
there is no difficulty in ascertaining the amount of com
pensation. But where the lands of any party, not men
tioned in the plans and books of reference, are damaged
by the taking of other lands by the company, and by the
construction of the line, it is often a matter of difficulty to
ascertain whether the injury is not too remote to form the
subject of compensation.
If the land be physically affected by the formation of
the railway, the owner will, as a matter of course, be
entitled to compensation, under the words “injuriously
affected.”(a) Thus a party has been held entitled to com
pensation for an injury to his land, occasioned by the
lowering of a road on which the claimant’s land abutted,
by reason of which its value was diminished, by the
impeding of the access to it, and by creating a necessity
for additional fences (b). So where the company had, in
executing their works, raised the level of a water-course
so as to throw the water back and inundate some coal
pits, they were held liable to compensate the owner (c).
So in another case, for damage done to a house, (not men
tioned in the schedule,) by the obstructions of its lights by
a station erected, and by the dust drifted from the station
and embankment (d). So where the drainage of land was
intercepted,(e) and where the lessee of minerals was pre
vented from working them under and within a certain
distance of the line (f); and so where the access to a wharf

was impeded (a). The company are also liable to make
good all damage done to the property of any water or gas
company, and to make full compensation to all parties
suffering any loss by reason of interference with the mains
and pipes of the companies, or with the private service
pipes of any person supplied with water or gas (b). But
parties are not entitled to compensation for loss of busi
ness in consequence of the execution of the works leading
to the opening of new thoroughfares, or to the obstructing
the access by old ones, whereby the custom of a house is
diminished (c). Nor will the company be liable to com
pensate the owner of a mine whose land they have pur
chased, the working of which has been rendered more
expensive by the execution of the works, where he did not
claim compensation at the time (d). (For an injury of
this nature, however, special provision is now made by
sec. 81 of the stat. 8 Vic, c. 20.) Nor is a party entitled
to compensation for any other than physical injuries.
Future or contingent damages are not the subject of
compensation, unless they are mentioned in the special
Act, there being no provisions embracing them in any of
the general Railway Acts; and even where they are in
cluded, the party demanding compensation must show
that the cause of the injury exists in some work of the
company already done. Thus where it was provided, that
in case of disputes or difference between the company and
the persons interested in the lands, &c., taken, used,
damaged, or affected by the execution of any of the powers
of the Act, a jury should ascertain “the sum of money to
be paid for the purchase of such lands, and also what other
separate sum or sums of money should be paid by way of
recompense for the damages which shall or may, before

that time, have been sustained as aforesaid, or for the
future, temporary, or perpetual continuance of any recurring
damages, which shall have been occasioned as aforesaid,
and the cause or occasion of which shall have been only in
part obviated or repaired by the company, and which can
or will be no further obviated, repaired, or remedied by
them.” The jury having assessed the value of the land at
£6 present damages, future damages £2,800, it was held
that that part of the verdict which related to future
damages was void; as in order to enable the jury, under
the Act of Parliament, to make a contingent assessment
of damages, it is necessary that the cause of injury should
exist in some work of the company that has already been
done.(a)
So a party entitled to an easement over lands purchased
by a company was held not entitled to compensation until
damage was actually done.(b)
There is this distinction in the mode of proceeding as
to the lands purchased for the purpose of the undertaking,
and the injury done to lands which, though not taken, are
obviously liable to be injuriously affected by the proximity
of the line, and those which are neither required for the
execution of the works nor manifestly damaged thereby,
that in the former cases it is incumbent on the company
to serve the parties with notice of their intention to take
the land required, and give compensation for the property
injured; whilst, in the latter case, parties claiming com
pensation must serve notices upon the company, requiring
them to give compensation, or to have the amount thereof
settled in the mode prescribed by the Lands' Clauses
Act (c). In clear cases of damage, as well as in those of
purchase, the company must take the initiative, and give
Easements.

notice to the parties interested. But when the property
is only remotely affected by the execution of the works,
the owners, &c., must prefer their claim for compensation,
and give notice of it to the company.
SEC. III.—Purchase of Lands by Agreement.
A H R the owners, occupiers, and other parties interested
in the lands required for the purposes of the railway, have
received notice from the company to treat for the purchase
of them, they have twenty-one days within which they may
send to the company the requisite information as to the
nature and extent of their interests and claims, and come
to some amicable understanding as to the amount of the
compensation which they are to receive (a). The answers
to the company should specify the nature of the property
which the claimant has in the land; whether as owner or
occupier. If owner, whether his estate is in possession or
reversion, for life or lives, or for years, or in fee; if an
occupier, the nature of his occupation, whether as lessee,
(and if so, the length of the unexpired residue of his term),
and whether renewable or not, or tenant from year to year,
or otherwise (b).
It is provided, by the 6th section of the Lands' Clauses’
Consolidation Act, that the company shall be empowered
to contract for and purchase the lands which they may re
quire for the purposes of the railway, subject to the provi
sions of that Act, and of their Act of Incorporation.
With respect to the parties of whom those purchases
are to be made, the 7th section enables all persons being
seized, possessed of or entitled to any such lands, or any
estate or interest therein, to sell and convey, or release

the same to the promoters of the undertaking, and to en
ter into all necessary agreements for that purpos'.
The above section gives the company full power to
treat with all persons having any interest in the land for
the absolute sale thereof, and applies to all parties, whether
absolutely entitled or having only a particular estate,
and who, except under the Acts of Parliament, would not
have power to part with more than their own interest.
Such are tenants in tail, married women, seized in their
own right or entitled to dower, trustees, feoffees in trust
for charitable or other purposes, and parties entitled to
the rents and profits of lands in possession, or subject to
any dower, or to any lease for life or lives, year or years,
or any less interest; so also mortgagees and the parties
entitled to the equity of redemption:
Any agreement as to sale (but not as to the amount of
consideration) made between such parties having limited
interests, and the company, will be binding not merely on
the parties themselves, their respective heirs, executors,
and administrators, but on all persons entitled in re
mainder, reversion, or expectancy, in the same manner
and to the same extent as if the persons in possession,
or entitled to the rents and profits, had been absolutely
entitled to the lands in question (a).
So likewise persons filling a representative capacity, as
guardians, committees of lunatics and idiots, executors
and administrators, and the committee of persons entitled
to rights of common, appointed in the mode prescribed by
the Lands’ Clauses' ConsolidationAct, (b) may agree for the
absolute sale of the interests of the respective parties whom
they represent (c).
Corporations also, sole or aggregate, are entitled to
treat for the sale of lands belonging to them, and may sell
and convey them to the company absolutely. But
municipal corporations are precluded from selling any
property (other than that which the company are em

powered to take compulsorily) without the approbation
of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, if they
could not have sold it without such approbation before the
passing of the company’s special Act (a).
Married women entitled to dower, however, and lessees
for life, or lives and years, and parties having less interests,
are not enabled, under the Lands' Clauses’ Act, to sell,
convey, and release to the company, any interests other
than their own (b).
Although enabled by the statute under consideration
to sell and convey lands, yet the parties having limited
interests, and deriving authority under this Act, are not
empowered to settle the value of the lands so sold, or re
ceive the amount of compensation, but the assessment
must be made and the compensation paid in the mode
prescribed by the Act (c).
Any agreement for the sale of lands must be in writing,
and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some
party lawfully authorised by him (d).
Though the agreement was made before the company
was incorporated, it will be binding on them after incor
poration, as in obtaining their Act all agreements made
previous thereto are deemed incorporated therein (e). Before
the passing of the statute, 8th Vic. c. 16, it was necessary
for a railway company entering into a contract after their
incorporation to make it under their common seal, other
wise whilst the contract remained executory it could not
be enforced against them. But if either the company or
the other contracting party by any subsequent recog
nition had adopted the contract, or performed their part
of the agreement, either party would have been entitled
to claim performance by the other, although the original
contract was not under the seal of the company (f).

The ninety-seventh section of the above-mentioned
statute seems, however, to alter the law in this respect,
and enables the directors of a company to contract on its
behalf in writing or by parol, as in the case of private
individuals; the corporate seal being necessary only where
the contract is of such a nature as under the general
law would be required to be made under seal.
If the party contracting with the company be abso
lutely entitled to the lands or interest in question, the con
sideration to be paid is of course a matter of agreement inter
se; but in the case of parties who could not have sold and
conveyed lands without the enabling clauses of the statute
8th Vic. c. 18, or of the special Act, the amount of the
purchase money and compensation to be paid for damage
is to be ascertained and determined by the valuation of
two able practical surveyors, one to be nominated by the
promoters of the undertaking, and the other by the other
party; and in the event of their differing, then by a third
surveyor, to be appointed by two justices upon the appli
cation of either party (a). The valuation is to be accom
panied by a declaration of its correctness, signed by the
surveyor (b). The amount of purchase money or com
pensation so ascertained is then to be paid into the Bank
of England for the benefit of the parties interested, in
manner hereinafter mentioned(c).
Persons seized in fee of, or entitled to dispose of abso
lutely for their own benefit, any lands, may sell and
convey the same to the promoters of the undertaking, in
consideration of an annual rent-charge payable by the said
promoters; but in all other cases the consideration for the
purchase of lands and for damage thereto must be in a
gross sum (d). The yearly rents so reserved are to be
charged on the tolls or rates payable under the special
Act, and when in arrear may be recovered by action of
debt or by distress(e).

We have seen that a notice to treat for the purchase
of any lands included in the schedule of their Special
Act, as soon as it is served by the company upon
the owner establishes at once the relation of vendor and
purchasers between the parties. When a contract has once
been entered into for the purchase and sale of lands,
the Courts of Equity will enforce a specific performance
of it, and will restrain the company from entering upon
the land until the purchase money has been paid (a).
As we have before remarked, it is doubtful whether a
Court of Equity will decree specific performance ofa contract
by a railway company to purchase land, if the company
should afterwards so exercise their powers as to disable
themselves from taking the same land; and whether the
vendor has any, and, if any, what, remedy in such case (b).
As to the enforcement by a Court of Chancery of such
a contract, it would seem (to say the least) in the highest
degree improbable, inasmuch as, under the circumstances
supposed, the contract would be void, the company having
no authority whatever to purchase or hold the lands
included in it. At the same time, if by their own act
and in the exercise of a discretion vested in them, the
Company have disabled themselves from the performance
of their agreement, it would appear to be only just that
the vendor should recover from them a compensation in
damages for the injury (if any) which he has sustained
through their default.

Sec. IV.—Purchase of Lands otherwise than by
Agreement.
If the company cannot come to any amicable arrangement
with the parties whose lands they propose to purchase, or
if the owners and occupiers refuse or neglect for twenty
one days (a) to send any reply to the notices which have
been served, or to treat for the sale of their property, the
promoters of the undertaking are empowered by the
Lands’ Clauses Consolidation Act, in connexion with
their special Act, to take certain steps to enforce a
compulsory sale of the required land.
Before proceeding to notice the formalities prescribed
in cases where the company find it necessary to resort
to their compulsory powers, we must remark on one or
two preliminary matters of the greatest importance.
And first, it is to be observed, that compulsory powers
must be given to the company by the express words of
the Act under which they are claimed, for they cannot be
implied. Such powers being repugnant to the spirit of
the common law must be distinctly defined, and the exer
cise of them will be jealously watched by the courts, lest
those intrusted with them should arbitrarily interfere with
the rights and interests of individuals (b).
The time within which compulsory powers may be exer
cised is also limited either by the special Act, or, if no
period be therein prescribed, then it is fixed by the
Lands’ Clauses’ Consolidation Act, (c), at three years from
the time of passing the special Act.
By the statute 5 & 6 Wict. c. 55, however, provision is
made(d) for the extension of the time, and that Act, after re
citing that it is in many cases expedient for the public safety,

that additional lands should be taken for the purposes of
the railway, proceeds to enact, that, in every case in
which the Board of Trade “shall certify that the public
safety requires additional land to be taken by any railway
company, the compulsory powers of purchasing and taking
land contained in the Act or Acts of such railway com
pany, together with all the clauses and provisions relative
thereto, shall, as regards such portion, or portions, of
land as are mentioned in the certificate of the said
Board,” revive and be in full force for such further pe
riod as shall be mentioned in such certificate.
Fourteen days’ notice must be given to the persons to
be affected by this certificate of the intended application;
during this period, any of the parties so to be affected
may apply to the Board of Trade in opposition to the
application, and if the application be refused, the com
pany will have to repay to the opponents the costs of their
opposition. These provisions apply only to the taking of
any additional lands required for the public safety, and
not to such lands as are required for the formation of the
line, and which the company may have neglected to take
within the prescribed period."
Where the undertaking is intended to be carried into
effect by means of a capital to be subscribed by the com
pany, the whole amount of such capital must be sub
scribed under a contract, binding the parties, their heirs,
executors, and administrators, for the payment of the
same, before the company can put in force any of the com
pulsory powers with which they are endowed for the
taking of land (a).
Before giving notice to parties to treat for their lands,
this preliminary should be observed, and some evidence
of it should be given to those who are required to part
with their property to the company. This may be easily
done, inasmuch as, by the Lands’ Clauses Consolidation

Act, a certificate under the hands of two justices is suf
ficient proof that the whole of the capital has been sub
scribed. (a). It does not appear that the company is
bound to give any such evidence, inasmuch as the non
subscription of the required amount of capital being a
defeasance of the compulsory clauses of the Act, should
rather come by way of objection from the other side (b);
but should they enter upon any lands previously to the
subscription of the capital, they would be liable to an
action of trespass at the suit of the party upon whose
lands they entered, as they could not plead their power of
entry under the Act unless they showed strict compliance
with its provisions. So it is probable that a Court of
Equity would restrain them by injunction from proceed
ing with the works. For, although it was formerly a
matter of doubt whether the Court would interfere in
such cases, on the ground of the insufficiency of the funds
of the company; the 16th and 17th sections of the 18th
chapter of the 8th Vict, seem to settle the question. In
the former of those sections it is declared, that it shall
not be lawful to put in force the compulsory powers of the
Act, unless such subscription contract shall be completely
executed; and, in the latter, such a mode of proving that
complete execution is prescribed, as entirely removes any
objection on the ground of difficulty or inconvenience
in furnishing the required evidence. Although in two
cases (c) injunctions were granted, restraining the promoters
of the line from taking the lands of a person on the
ground of the insufficiency of the capital to finish the
undertaking; yet, in another case (d), it was refused by
Lord Chancellor Cottenham. On examining the latter

case, however, the injunction seems to have been asked,
not on account of the incomplete execution of the sub
scription contract, but of the insufficiency of the subscrip
tion and estimate. But, although it would appear from
the above, that the completion of the subscription con
tract is necessary before compulsory powers of taking
lands can be enforced; yet an inquisition would not be
void on account of its not naming the amount of such
subscription (a).
(1.) Settlement of Disputed Compensation.
We have already considered the formalities required in
giving notice to those whose lands will be wanted for the
purposes of the company; and as those formalities are
the same in all cases, whether the parties can settle
amicably the amount of compensation or not, it is unne
cessary to allude to them further in this place. Where,
however, after notice given, it is found impossible to come
to a satisfactory arrangement between the owners and the
company, other steps are necessary to ascertain and deter
mine the sum to be paid. Subject to certain exceptions
(to be mentioned hereafter), the party claiming compen
sation is entitled to have its amount ascertained either by
arbitration or assessment by a jury. The company, how
ever, have no such option, but are bound under the
Lands’ Clauses Act to submit the dispute to the decision
of a jury, unless the claimant signify his desire to have it
settled by arbitration; or unless, having been so referred,
the award of the arbitrators or of the umpire be not made
within three months (b).
And, first, if, for twenty-one days after the service of
the notice to treat, no amicable settlement be effected,

then, in all cases where the compensation claimed shall
not exceed £50, the matter shall be decided by two jus
tices.
The question is to be brought before this tribunal on
the application of either party; when any justice may
summon the other party to appear before two justices,
who, on the appearance of the parties, or on proof of the
service of the summons, may hear and determine the
matter, and for that purpose may examine the parties and
their witnesses upon oath. The costs of this inquiry are
to be in the discretion of the justices, both as to their
amount and the party to pay them (a).
For claims not exceeding £50, the parties have no power
to incur the expenses of arbitration, or inquiry before a
jury. If they cannot agree on the amount of compensa
tion, it can be settled in no other way than by the two
justices, as just mentioned. The vendor, however, may
always evade this jurisdiction if he disapprove of it, inas
much as the Act makes the amount of the claim the test
of the mode in which the question shall be tried; so that,
by asking for more than £50, the authority of the jus
tices is at once set aside, and another tribunal must be re
sorted to.
The jurisdiction of two justices also applies to claims for
compensation made by tenants at will,and tenants from year
to year; nor can they choose any other mode of settling
their differences with the company, whatever be the amount
of their claims (b).
Where the amount of compensation claimed, or offered,
exceeds the sum of £50, the claimant, if he desire it, may
have the matter settled by arbitration. In such cases he
must signify his wish by a notice in writing to the com
pany, before they have issued a warrant to the sheriff, (as

hereinafter mentioned), to summon a jury, stating therein
the nature of his interest in the lands, and the amount he
claims (a). -
It may be convenient here to state that any summons
or notices, or any writ, or any proceedings at law or in
equity, which are required to be served on the promoters
of the undertaking, may be served by the same being left
at, or transmitted through the post, directed to their
principal office, or one of their principal offices, if
there shall be more than one; or being given, or trans
mitted through the post, directed to the secretary; or,
in case there be no secretary, to the solicitor of the pro
moters (b).
In all cases which may or must, by the Lands' Clauses
Consolidation Act, or the Special Act, or any Act incorpo
rated therewith, be settled by arbitration, unless both par
ties concur in the appointment of a single arbitrator, each
party, on the request of the other, shall appoint an arbi
trator, to whom the dispute shall be referred. The arbi
trator for the company is to be appointed under the hands
of two of the promoters, or of the secretary or clerk; and
the arbitrator for any other party, under the hands of such
party; except it be a corporation aggregate, when it must
be under their common seal. (c)
The appointment so made is to be delivered to the arbi
trator, and is to be deemed a submission to arbitration on
the part of the party making it, and will be irrevocable
unless with the consent of both parties; nor will the death
of either party operate as a revocation (c).
This appointment of an arbitrator, and the delivery to
him of the instrument under which he is appointed, which
is to be deemed a submission to arbitration (c), may be
made a rule of any of the superior Courts, on the applica
tion of either of the parties (d). This should always be

done, in order to compel the attendance of witnesses, and
the production of documents which may be required; for,
although the arbitrators may call for any documents (a) in
the possession of the parties that they may think neces
sary for elucidating the matter referred, and may also
examine witnesses on oath; yet it does not appear that
they have any power to enforce the attendance of wit
nesses, or the production of documents, unless the sub
mission has been made a rule of Court. As soon as this
is done, the Court by which the rule shall be made, or any
Judge, may compel the attendance of parties and the pro
duction of documents; and any refusal to attend or pro
duce will be deemed a contempt, and be punishable ac
cordingly; provided that the proper expenses shall have
been tendered to the witness, an appointment of the time
and place of attendance have been made, and that he be
not compelled to produce any documents which he would
not be compelled to produce at a trial, or to attend more
than two consecutive days to be named in the order (b).
If for fourteen days after the dispute has arisen, and
after a request in writing, (in which the matter to be
referred to arbitration has been stated,) has been served
by the one party on the other, the latter fail to appoint
an arbitrator, then the arbitrator appointed may act on
behalf of both parties, and such arbitrator shall accord
ingly proceed to hear and determine the matters in dis
pute, and his award shall be final (c).
So if more than one arbitrator have been appointed, and
either of them refuse, or for seven days neglect, to act,
the other arbitrator may proceed ex parte as in the last
case, and his decision shall be as effectual as if he had
been the single arbitrator appointed by both parties (d).

the party who appointed him may nominate some other
person to act in his place; but if, after seven days’ notice
from the other party, for that purpose, he fail to do so,
the remaining arbitrator may proceed ex parte. If an
arbitrator be substituted for one dead or incapable, he will
be invested with the same powers and authorities as those
enjoyed by his predecessor (a).
Where only a single arbitrator has been appointed, and
he dies or becomes incapable before his award is made;
the matters are to be again referred to arbitration, under
the Lands’ Clauses Consolidation Act, or the Special Act,
as though no arbitrator had been before appointed (b).
Where two arbitrators have been appointed, they shall,
before they enter upon the matters referred to them,
appoint, by writing under their hands, an umpire to
decide on matters on which they shall differ, or which
shall be referred to him; and if he die or become inca
pable, they shall forthwith, in the like manner, appoint
another, whose decision shall be final (c).
If the arbitrators neglect or refuse for seven days after
the request of either party to appoint an umpire; the Board
of Trade, in any case in which a railway company shall be
one party to the arbitration, and two justices in any other
case, shall, on the application of either party, appoint an
umpire, whose decision shall be final (d).
When more than one arbitrator has been appointed,
and where both are acting, and they do not make their
award within twenty-one days after the day on which the
last of them was appointed, or within such extended time
(if any) as shall have been fixed for that purpose by both
of them under their hands: then the umpire shall deter

presence of a justice, that he will faithfully, honestly, and
to the best of his ability determine the matter referred to
him ; and this declaration must be annexed to the award
when made; and any arbitrator or umpire wilfully acting
contrary thereto will be guilty of a misdemeanour (a).
The arbitrators, within reasonable time after their
appointment, and within the time allowed by the Lands’
Clauses Consolidation Act, should appoint a day for meet
ing and hearing both parties. The parties themselves and
their witnesses must be heard; and although the admissi
bility or inadmissibility of evidence is entirely in the dis
cretion of the arbitrators (b), and although it would be no
ground for impeaching the validity of the award that the
arbitrators were mistaken in law as to such admissi
bility (c); still a refusal to examine the witnesses produced
by either party would be sufficient misconduct on the part
of the arbitrators to induce the Court to set aside the
award (d).
It is unnecessary in a work of this nature to specify
minutely the various stages of proceedings by arbitration,
as to which the reader is referred to the numerous works
written on the subject; still it may be as well to remark,
that the arbitrators are bound to act in a legal manner;
and that, unless by the terms of the submission they are
authorized to proceed in the absence of either party, an
award made after an investigation at which one or both
of the parties had been absent, would be set aside.
The award must be in writing, and must settle all the
matters in dispute which were referred.
The compensation to be made in respect of each se
parate claim ought to be specifically awarded; for although
the sections in the Lands’ Clauses Act, which empower
the owner of lands to refer his claim to arbitration, do

not absolutely require the arbitrator to assess separately
the value of the land taken and the compensation for da
mage done, as is directed in case of an inquiry and as
sessment by a jury (a); yet perhaps it is better to award
separately under each claim. Nevertheless, even a verdict
for a single sum, both for land taken and damage done,
would not be void on that account, as it has been held
that the clause on this subject is merely directory.(b)
It is especially provided that no award in respect of any
matter referred to arbitration shall be set aside for irre
gularity, or error in matter of form (c); but if the award be
bad on the face of it, in consequence of an omission on
the part of the arbitrator to take into consideration all the
matters referred, or of his refusal to hear the parties, or
of his proceeding in the absence of either party, no notice
having been given; it is submitted that on disclosure of
these facts, the Court would set it aside.
The award of the arbitrators must be made within twenty
one days from the day on which the last arbitrator was
appointed, or within such extended time as they may have
appointed under their hands. But, in every case, the
award must be made within three months from the time
the matter was referred to them; or it is to be withdrawn
from them, and to be determined by the verdict of a
jury (d).
When made, the award is to be delivered to the com
pany, who forthwith, on demand, and at their own ex
pense, are to deliver a copy thereof to the other party;
and, retaining the original, are to produce it on demand,
and allow it to be examined by the same party, or any
person appointed by him for that purpose (e).

awarded, no special remedy seems to be prescribed under
the Act. Although a company are not allowed to enter
on the lands until such sum shall have been paid, or
deposited in the bank, as required in certain cases, without
the consent of the parties; yet it may sometimes happen,
that this consent having been given before the money
is paid, it may become a matter of question as to the
mode to be adopted for recovery of the purchase-money or
compensation.
Under these circumstances, the claimant, by making
the submission to arbitration a rule of Court, which may
be done either before or after award made (a), may have
his ordinary remedy by debt on the award, or by attach
ment for non-payment of the amount. Hence it would
seem, that a mandamus could not be obtained to compel
the company to pay the money, the law having furnished
the party entitled with the above remedies (b).
With regard to the costs of an arbitration, the com
pany are to bear them in all cases where a larger sum is
awarded to the claimant than they offered, and the
amount of them is to be settled by the arbitrators. If
the same or a less sum than had been offered by the com
pany is awarded, then each party is to bear his own costs
incident to the arbitration, and the costs of the arbi
trators shall be borne by the parties in equal propor
tions (c). This arrangement seems scarcely fair to the
company, who may be driven by an unreasonable vendor
to incur the heavy expenses of arbitration; and on
having a decision justifying their own offer, and con
demnatory of the claim of the other party, are yet un
able to recover any of the costs consequent on the extrava
gant demand.

desire that it should be submitted to arbitration; or if,
having so submitted it, no award is made within three
months from the time of submission; then in such
case the question is to be determined by the verdict of
a jury. We proceed, therefore, to consider the steps
proper to be taken in thus ascertaining the compen
sation to be made. Before issuing a warrant to summon
a jury, the promoters of the undertaking are to give not
less than ten days' notice of their intention to the other
party; and must state, in their notice, the sum they
are willing to give for the interest in the lands which
they seek to purchase, and for the damage to be sustained
by the party by the execution of their works (a). Any
proceedings taken in pursuance of a notice not contain
ing an offer on the part of the company to treat for the
lands will be void (b). The due service of this notice
is material to justify ulterior measures with regard to the
payment of the purchase-money, and entry on the lands,
if the claimant fail to appear.
Where, however, the claimant expressly waives his
right to notice, he cannot afterwards object to the inqui
sition, on the ground of its not setting out such notice or
the waiver of it (c). Indeed, all objections of a formal
character are precluded by the 145th section of the Lands’
Clauses Consolidation Act, which Act prescribes the steps
to be taken in the proceedings under consideration, and
provides in the above-mentioned clause, that no proceed
ings taken in pursuance of the Act shall be quashed or
vacated for want of form. Notwithstanding this pro
vision, however, it is absolutely necessary that the notice
in question should be served upon the landowner, for the
company have no power to summon a jury to assess the

value of lands, as to which they have given no previous
notice to treat. (a).
After the lapse of ten days from the service of the
notice, and if no agreement be in the mean time made,
the promoters are to issue a warrant to the sheriff, under
their common seal, if they are incorporated, or under the
hands and seals of two of them, if they are not incorpo
rated; requiring him to summon a jury for the purpose of
settling the question of disputed compensation (b).
If the company refuse to issue their warrant, the
claimant has no power to do so. His only remedy for
merly was by application to the Court of Queen’s Bench
for a mandamus to compel them, or by injunction in
equity to restrain them from entering on the lands until
the amount of compensation was assessed and paid. Now,
however, by the 68th section of the 8 Vic. c. 18, if the
promoters, on receiving a notice to that effect from the
party claiming compensation, fail, for twenty-one days,
either to enter into a written agreement for payment of
the sum demanded, or to issue a warrant to the sheriff
to summon a jury, they are to be liable to pay to the
claimant the amount asked, which may be recovered, with
costs, by action in any of the superior Courts.
Independently of these provisions, a party whose lands
have been absolutely taken by the company for the pur
poses of the line, and entered upon before any compensa
tion has been ascertained or deposited, may treat the
company as trespassers, or stay their proceedings by
injunction. But where the lands are not taken, but are
injured by the execution of the works, the owner is pre
cluded from bringing his action against the company for
proceedings taken under their Act; his only remedy being
(formerly) to apply for a mandamus, commanding the
company to take steps for assessing compensation. Now,
however, under the section just cited, the party injured

would be entitled to recover in an action the amount he
claims of the company. Inasmuch as a mandamus is only
granted where there is no specific legal remedy, this clause
would probably be held to take away the right of the
injured party to this writ to enforce the payment of his
demand (a).
The warrant issued must be in exact conformity with
the notice given to the party, and must specify the precise
quantity and the same parcels of land. Therefore, where
a company had given a notice containing particulars of a
certain quantity of land required for the purposes of the
railway, and afterwards issued a warrant, summoning a
jury to assess a smaller quantity than that mentioned in
their notice; it was held by the Lord Chancellor that they
had no power to do so. His Lordship says, “The Act
requires that this step (the issuing of the warrant) shall
be preceded by a previous notice what is to be the subject
matter of inquiry before the jury; but the jury notice
comprises a fraction only of that which is comprehended
in the previous notice; and if I were to consider this as
within the provisions of the Act, it would be in the power
of the company, having given a notice for any portion
of property, to subdivide that into as many proceedings
before the sheriff as they might think fit; having given
notice for one hundred yards of land, they might have a
separate jury process for each yard (b).
If the sheriff be a party interested in the matter in dis
pute, then the warrant must be directed to one of the
coroners for the county in which the lands, or some of
them, are situate. If all the coroners of the county be so
interested, then application must be made to some person
having filled the office of sheriff or coroner in such county,
and who shall be then living there, and not be interested

last mentioned, preference is to be given to one who shall
have most recently served either of the said offices; and
every ex-sheriff, coroner, or ex-coroner shall have power,
if he think fit, to appoint a deputy or assessor (a). When
the sheriff to whom the precept has been directed is an
interested party, as a shareholder in the company, appear
ance before him is a waiver of the objection, so far as the
company are concerned, inasmuch as they had the means
of knowing from their own books whether he was a share
holder or not; and they cannot therefore be permitted,
after having knowingly constituted one of their own body
a judge in their own behalf, to avail themselves of their
own wrong, by afterwards setting aside the proceedings
for irregularity (b).
If the warrant to summon a jury be directed to a
coroner or other person to whom it may lawfully be
directed, the sheriff, on receiving notice of the same, must,
on application, hamd over the jurors’ book and special
jurors’ list belonging to the county where the lands in
question shall be situate, to the person to whom the war
rant has been directed.
On receiving the warrant above mentioned, the sheriff
is to summon a jury of twenty-four persons, qualified to
serve as jurors in the superior courts, to meet at a time
and place to be appointed by him; such time to be not
less than fourteen, nor more than twenty-one days after
the receipt of the warrant; and such place not being more
than eight miles distant from the lands in question, unless
by consent of the parties interested; and shall give notice
to the promoters of the time and place so appointed (c).

are to be selected in the usual manner; or if an insuffi
cient number attend, bystanders duly qualified may be
called upon to serve. The parties are to be allowed their
lawful challenges to the jurymen, but may not challenge
the array (a).
At the request of either party, the inquiry may be in
stituted before a special jury. If the claimant require it,
he must give his notice to the promoters of the undertak
ing before they have issued their warrant to the sheriff:
that is, before the expiration of ten days after he has been
served with a notice of their intention to issue such war
rant. On receiving the notice, the promoters are to issue
a warrant to the sheriff accordingly; and, on receipt of
the warrant, the sheriff is to summon the parties before
him at a convenient time, (not being less than five, nor
more than eight, days after the service of such summons),
for the purpose of striking a special jury in the usual
manner. The sheriff shall then name a day—not less than
eight days after striking the jury—for reducing the num
ber of such jury to twenty; whereof he shall give four
days notice to the parties (b). On the inquiry, the spe
cial jury shall consist of twelve of the twenty who shall
first appear on their names being called over; and any
deficiency in the number may be supplied in the usual
way (c).
The trial will be, in all respects, similar to that before a
common jury, and the like penalties will be applicable.
On the consent of the parties, any other inquiry may be
tried before the same special jury(d).
No juryman shall, without his consent, be summoned
or required to attend any such proceeding more than once
in a year (e).

by his deputy, who was assisted by a barrister as assessor,
although the court held that as the proceedings originated
correctly, the section taking away certiorari, would pre
vent the issuing of a mandamus; yet they intimated a
strong opinion that the course adopted by the sheriff was
irregular (a). On this inquiry, the party claiming com
pensation is to be deemed the plaintiff, and is to enjoy all
the rights and privileges incident to that character. If
the sheriff be so requested, in writing, by either of the
parties, he is to summon witnesses, and also to order the
jury, or six, or more of them, to view the place or matter
in controversy (b).
For any default of the sheriff he is liable to a penalty
of £50., and any juror mot attending, unless he furnish a
reasonable excuse, is to forfeit £10, and be exposed

or his deputy, ex officio, presides at the execution of the
writ of inquiry; but he has no jurisdiction in the absence
of the claimant, and, therefore, if the party claiming com
pensation does not appear he cannot proceed; but in such
case the amount of compensation must be ascertained by
a surveyor appointed by two justices (a). If the claimant
attend, it would not seem that the proceedings are stayed
by the non-attendance of the company; but the sheriff
would proceed with the inquiry ex parte the person claim
ing compensation, who (as we have seen) is considered as
the plaintiff, and is entitled to the same privileges as
plaintiffs in actions at law. This provision has been
construed as designed merely to regulate the proceedings,
and to remove any doubts as to the right to begin (b).
The company should, in the first place, give some
evidence of compliance with formal preliminaries, as
that the whole of the capital is subscribed, as re
quired by the Lands’ Clauses Consolidation Act; that
proper notices were served on the party whose lands
are required, and that such party failed to treat within
the proper time; that the land is authorised to be
taken by the Special Act, and contained in the plans and
books of reference, or omitted by mistake, and inserted
under the certificates in such cases granted by two jus
tices; that the party had due notice from the company
of their intention to issue their warrant to the sheriff for
the purpose of summoning a jury; and, also, that they had
in such notice made an offer of the sum they were willing
to give for the lands, and as compensation for damage;
and that they had done every thing required to give the
sheriff jurisdiction. These preliminary points being ascer
tained, the party claiming compensation begins, and pro
duces witnesses to show the value of the property re
quired, as well as the deterioration suffered in respect of

what remains. The company are, of course, at liberty to
cross-examine such witnesses, and after the plaintiff's
case is finished, call witnesses on their own behalf. The
claimant then has the privilege of reply.
Having heard the evidence, the jury are to give a ver
dict separately for the sum of money to be paid for the
purchase of the lands required, or of the claimant’s inter
est therein, and for the sum of money to be paid by way
of compensation for the damage done to other lands be
longing to the plaintiff, by severance, or otherwise, by the
execution of the works (a).
This enactment as to the separate assessment of damages
has, in previous Acts of Parliament, been held to be direc
tory only, and not compulsory; so that a non-compliance
with it does not avoid the verdict, at least on the ground
of misdirection, where the point was not taken on the
trial (b). If, however, there be several claimants, each
having a separate interest in the subject matter of the dis
pute, and the jury does not find, nor the inquisition
specify, the amount of purchase money or compensation to
which each of them is entitled for his share or interest
therein; the proceeding will be void, and the parties claim
ing compensation, may procure a mandamus compelling
the company to take steps for a new inquiry (c).
When the verdict is delivered, the sheriff is to give judg
ment for the amount of purchase money or compensation
assessed by the jury; and to sign the verdict andjudgment,
which are to be delivered to the clerk of the peace for the
county in which the lands in question, or any part of them,
are situate, and kept among the records of the general or

lowed, on payment of one shilling; and copies or extracts
(to be signed and certified by the clerk of the peace) are
to be given, on payment of sixpence for every hundred
words (a). Every preliminary required by the Lands'
Clauses Act, and the Special Act to give jurisdiction to the
sheriff, ought, as in other cases of local and limited juris
diction, to be set out on the face of the inquisition (b).
Thus the inquisition should state that notice was given to
the parties to treat, and that they failed to come to any
agreement (c). That notice was also given of the company's
intention to issue their warrant to the sheriff; and the
inquisition should show that the verdict corresponds with
the warrant to the sheriff, and the warrant with the
notice (d). If, however, sufficient appear on the face of
the document to give jurisdiction, it does not seem that
the same strictness is required in drawing up these inqui
sitions as in the records of inferior Courts in general (e).
Thus it has been held unnecessary to mention the cer
tificate granted by twojustices for the taking possession of
land omitted by mistake in the schedule and books of
reference (f); nor that the lands were included in the
schedule and books of reference, or a certificate granted as
before (g); nor that the capital required was wholly sub
scribed (h). As to the last point, it was decided that the
non-subscription of the required amount of capital is a
defeasance of the compulsory clauses of the Act, and need

not be set out on the face of the inquisition, but ought to
come by way of answer from the other side; it not being
incumbent on the promoters to prove a full subscription,
but necessary for those who dispute it to disprove it.
If the interests of several parties be included in the
same inquiry, the inquisition must set out separately the
amount of compensation awarded for the interest of each
party; and if the verdict be found for one entire sum, it
will be bad (a). For the general requisites and form of
the inquisition, the reader is referred to the cases men
tioned in the notes (b).
The inquisition is conclusive as to every thing submitted
to and decided by the jury, and contained therein; but it
would seem that if the jury have failed to take into con
sideration all the matters referred to them, the Court of
Queen’s Bench would grant a mandamus compelling the
sheriff to summon a jury for the purpose of determining
the matter omitted. Thus where, through a mistake of
the sheriff, in his judicial capacity, the inquiry before him
was stopped, and no assessment made, the Court, on appli
cation of the party aggrieved, issued a mandamus to the
sheriff to execute the precept (c). A very strong case must
however be made out, or they will refuse to interfere.
Thus, in one instance, when an inquisition had been duly
held before the sheriff to assess damages in pursuance of
a precept issued by a railway company, under their Act,
which provided that such verdict should be final; the Court
refused an application for a mandamus to compel the issu
ing of a new precept, though made on the grounds of mis
direction,—of the improper rejection of evidence, of the
verdict being against evidence, and the damages grossly

insufficient,-saying they were asked to do indirectly what
they could not do directly, that is, to amend the inqui
sition (a). In that case, however, the Special Act under
which the inquiry was held, declared that the verdict and
judgment should be final and conclusive; but the Lands'
Clauses Act contains no such provision. The only clause
on that subject (145) enacts that the proceedings in pur
suance of the Act shall not be quashed for want of form,
nor removed by certiorari, or otherwise, into the superior
Courts.
The interpretation which will be put by the Court upon
the above clause, may be gathered from their decision on
a similar one in a Special Railway Act. By one of the sec
tions of the latter, it was provided that where agreement for
compensation for damages incurred in the execution of
the Act could notbe made, the company should issue their
warrant to the sheriff to impannel a jury, who should, upon
their oaths, inquire of, assess, and give a verdict for the
sum to be paid for compensation for the damages sus
tained. The company issued a warrant to the sheriff to
impannel a jury to assess the sum of money, if any, to be
paid to the claimant, by way of compensation: the jury
returned that he had sustained no damage; and the Court
held on application for a certiorari, that though the words
“if any” ought to have been omitted, the warrant gave
jurisdiction, and therefore that the inquisition being a
proceeding in pursuance of the Act, the writ could not
issue (b).
Although it was formerly doubted whether any civil
remedy existed for enforcing the verdicts and judgments in
compensation cases; yet it is now settled that if the com
pany fail to pay the sum awarded by the jury, the party
entitled may recover it by action of debt on the inqui

sition. (a) Before the decision of this case, the Court of
Queen’s Bench issued a mandamus compelling the com
pany to pay the amount of damages assessed by the
jury. (b) - -
All the costs of an inquiry before ajury are to be borne
by the company in all cases where the verdict shall be
given for a greater sum than that offered by them (c).
These costs are to include all reasonable costs, charges,
and expenses incurred in summoning, impanelling, and re
turning the jury, taking the inquiry, the attendance of
witnesses, the employment of counsel and attornies, re
cording the verdict and judgment thereon, and otherwise
incident to the inquiry (d). Thus the costs to which the
company are subject, on an inquiry before a jury where
the verdict shall be for a larger sum than that offered by
them, will include the general costs thereof, as in the case
of an ordinary trial; the words of the earlier part of the
51st section taken in connection with the 52nd section
being sufficiently comprehensive for that purpose. But
when the verdict is given for the same or a less sum than
that offered, or when the claimant having had due notice
fails to appear, one half of the costs of summoning, im
panelling, and returning the jury, and of taking the in
quiry, and recording the verdict and judgment thereon
(in case such verdict shall be taken), shall be defrayed by
the owner of the lands, and the other half by the company;
and each party shall bear his own costs other than as
aforesaid incident to the inquiry. The latter provision, so
far as it inflicts costs upon the claimant, does so in terms
far less general than those above cited in respect of the
company. As to what are included in the costs to be
paid, in the cases supposed, by the party claiming compen

CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 223
sation, we may refer to the cases which have been decided
on similar clauses in former Railway Acts.
A Railway Act provided for summoning a jury to assess What may be
compensation in case of disagreement respecting the pur
chase of lands, and the party claiming compensation should
be plaintiff, and have all such rights and privileges as
plaintiffs in actions at common law are entitled to. Another
section enacted, “That in every case in which the verdict
of the jury shall be given for the same or a greater sum
than shall have been previously offered by the company,
all the costs of summoning such jury, and the expenses of
witnesses, shall be defrayed by the said company; if for a
lower sum, then one moiety by each of the parties.” It
was then provided, “That all parties with whom the com
pany shall have any such dispute, and who shall require
a jury to be summoned, shall enter into a bond to bear
and pay their proportion of the costs and expenses of
summoning and returning such jury, and taking such ver
dict, and of the summoning and attendance of witnesses,
in case any part of such costs and expenses shall fall upon
them.” In a case where no offer had been made by the
company, but a jury had been summoned, and assessed
compensation to the claimant, it was held that the above
clauses (notwithstanding the provisions of the first-named
section), did not entitle the claimant to the costs of the
attorney’s letters and attendances, nor to the expenses of
plans, &c., paid to surveyors not called as witnesses (a).
Where a compensation clause in a Railway Act, enacted,
“That the value was to be settled by a jury; and that in
case the jury should give a greater sum than had been
offered by the company, all the costs of summoning the
jury, and the expenses of witnesses,” should be defrayed
by the company; but if the jury should give the same or
a less sum than had been offered, one moiety of the said
costs and expenses was to be defrayed by the party to

whom the land belonged; and a subsequent clause enacted
that the party with whom the company should have any
dispute should enter into a bond to pay his proportion of
the costs and expenses of summoning and returning such
jury, and taking such verdict, and of the summoning and
attendance of witnesses, in case any part of such costs
should fall upon him: the Court held, that the words,
“the costs of taking such verdict,” did not mean the
costs of trial; and that the fees of counsel and costs of
the attorney, respecting the preparing for and attendance
at the trial, could not be allowed (a).
In case of dispute, the question of costs is to be referred
to one of the masters of the Court of Queen's Bench (b).
If any costs payable by either party are not paid within
seven days after demand, on application to a justice to
issue his warrant for that purpose, they can be recovered
by distress (c). This latter remedy being given by the
statute, a mandamus would not be granted to compel the
company to pay costs, at least until an endeavour had
been made to levy them by distress (d).
(2) Compensation to Absent Parties.
When parties whose lands are required for the purposes
of the railway are either absent from the kingdom, or after
diligent inquiry cannot be found, or fail to appear at the
time appointed for the inquiry before the jury; then the
amount of compensation to be paid for the purchase of such
of the lands of those persons as are taken by the company,
and for the damage of such as are injuriously affected by
the execution of the works, is to be determined by an able

the application of the promoters; who must show to the
satisfaction of the justices that the parties entitled to com

or have failed to appear before the jury (b).
The surveyor having been appointed makes his valuation,

himself, of the correctness thereof (c). Before proceeding

his skill and ability, make the valuation intrusted to him.
Any corrupt breach of this declaration is a misdemeanor (d).
The nomination and declaration above-mentioned are
to be annexed to the valuation; and the whole of the
documents must be preserved by the company, who are to
produce them to the owners of the lands in question
on demand, and to all other parties interested therein (e).
The whole expenses of the valuation and proceed

moters (f).
If the owners be dissatisfied with the amount of the
valuation, they may, on giving notice in writing to the
company, have the question of value submitted to arbi

mentioned (g).
If the arbitators decide that a sufficient sum has been
already paid by the promoters, the costs of the arbitration
are to be in the discretion of the arbitrators; but if they
award a further sum to the claimant, then the costs are to

In all cases in which the persons of whom purchases of
property have been made by a company, having full
power to sell for their own absolute use, shall have made
a good title, executed the conveyance tendered by the
company, and are not absent from the kingdom, the
money must be paid to them before the company can
enter; except in cases where an annual rent-charge has
been the consideration for the purchase instead of a sum
in gross. But where the purchase-money, or compensa
tion, is coming to parties having limited interests, or inca
pable of selling, except under the provisions of the general
or special Railway Acts, or not making title; it is to be
disposed of as provided by the Lands' Clauses Compensa
tion Act, or the Special Act incorporated therewith.
In the case of compensation for commonable rights,
where a committee has been appointed at a meeting of
commoners duly convened, whether the sum to be paid
has been fixed by agreement, or ascertained under the
compulsory powers of the Act; the committee are the pro
per parties to receive the compensation, and the receipt of
any three of them will be a discharge to the company for
the amount; nor will the latter be bound to see to the
application of the money among the parties interested.
If there has been no committee appointed, the money
must be deposited in the Bank, in the name of the Ac
countant-General of the Court of Chancery (b).
Where the lands have been purchased by the company
from any corporation, tenant for life or in tail, married

woman seized in her own right or entitled to dower,
minor, guardian, committee of lunatic or idiot, trustee,
executor or administrator, or person having a partial or
qualified interest only in such lands, and not entitled to
sell or convey the same except under the provisions of the
above-mentioned Acts, or one of them; then if the pur
chase-money, or compensation, to be paid for any per
manent damage, amount to, or exceed the sum of £200,
it shall be paid into the Bank of England, in the name
of the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery in
England, when the lands are in England or Wales; or in
the name of the Accountant-General of the Court of Ex
chequer in Ireland, if the lands be there (a).
The money so deposited is to remain until applied to
some one or more of the following purposes: (that is to
say,) In the purchase or redemption of the land-tax, or
the discharge of any debt or incumbrance affecting the
land in respect of which such money shall have been paid,
or affecting other lands settled therewith to the same or
the like uses, trusts, or purposes; or in the purchase of
other lands to be conveyed, limited, and settled, upon the
like uses, trusts, and purposes, and in the same manner as
the lands in respect of which such money shall have been
paid, stood settled; or, if such money shall be paid in
respect of any buildings taken under the authority of this
or the Special Act, or injured by the proximity of the
works, in removing or replacing such buildings, or substi
tuting others in their stead, in such manner as the Court
of Chancery shall direct, or in payment to any party be
coming absolutely entitled to such money (b).
The Courts of Chancery have a discretion in the appli
cation of money deposited in their hands under the pro
visions of an Act of Parliament; therefore, where money
is in Court under a Railway Act, previous to being laid
out in lands to be settled “to the like uses,” the Court

will lend its aid to an advantageous purchase beyond the
amount of the money in Court, and will direct the extra
costs to be paid out of the money in Court (a). So a
small sum of money deposited in Court to be laid out
in lands to be settled “to the like uses,” has been
ordered to be applied in new erections (b).
The application of the money will be made by the
Court, on the petition of the party who would have been
entitled to the rents and profits of the lands of which it
is the proceeds; and until the fund is so applied it may
be laid out in the purchase of government securities, and
the interest, dividends, and annual proceeds, be paid to
the party who would, for the time being, have been en
titled to the rents and profits of the lands (c).
A question has sometimes arisen as to the effect of a
contract for sale of lands to a railway company, where the
vendor dies before the money is paid and the purchase com
pleted,—whether, in such an event, the nature of the pro
perty has been changed from realty to personalty, so as to
alter the mode of its devolution. In a case(d) decided by the
Vice-Chancellor of England in Michaelmas Term, 1843, it
was held, that under such circumstances the personal repre
sentatives were entitled to the purchase money.
Here it will be observed that the deceased, being abso
lutely entitled to the property in question, had himself
contracted with the corporation of London for the sale of
the land to them, and by his own act, therefore, had con
verted it into personalty. But where a party has land
taken from him under compulsory powers, and he obsti
nately refuses to execute any conveyance, or accept the
purchase money, and dies; the nature of the property
would probably be held to remain unchanged; and the
money paid into the bank in the manner directed in such

cases would belong to those who would have been entitled
to the land. In such a case the party could not be said
to consent, nor was the conversion of the property from
realty to personalty his own act.
This view seems confirmed by the following case, the
facts of which were as follow:—“A railway company,
under the provisions of their Act, were empowered to take
lands, and it was made lawful for all corporations, &c., and
for all other persons whomsoever, to contract for the sale
thereof, and convey the same to the company. The company
gave notice of their intention to treat to A., who was at
that time imbecile, but who, previous to his imbecility,
had made a will, whereby he gave and bequeathed ‘ all
my money, goods, chattels, estates, and effects, of what
nature or kind soever, and wheresoever the same may be
found,’ to his wife for life, and after her decease to his
children equally. A. died before the purchase money for
the piece of land taken by the company, (which had been
assessed by a jury,) had been paid. It was held, that the
land was not converted by the proceedings under the
Railway Act, and that the purchase money belonged to
the devisees of the land; the Act not being intended to
change the nature or quality, in point of devolution, of
any man’s property, who was incapable of consenting (a).
Where the purchase money amounts to £20, but is less
than £200, it may either be paid into the bank as above
mentioned, and dealt with in a similar manner, or it may
be paid to two trustees, to be nominated by the parties
who were entitled to the rents and profits of the land.
The nomination of the trustees must be under the hands
of the parties, or if they are under incapacity, as in case
of coverture, infancy, or lunacy, it may be made by their
respective husbands, guardians, committees, or trustees;
but in this case the money will not be paid to the parties
nominated, unless the company approve of them. The

If the purchase money be less than £20, it may be paid

which did not belong absolutely to the party who sold
them, exceeds £20, it is to be paid into the bank, or to
the trustees, as before mentioned. The parties who have
so contracted for the sale of such lands, but who are not
absolutely entitled, cannot retain any part of the purchase
money, or of the compensation paid for damage, or inte
rest paid in lieu of bridges, tunnels, or other accommo
dation works, or for assenting to, or not opposing the
passing of the company's bill; but the whole is deemed to
have been contracted to be paid for and on account of the
several parties interested in such lands, as well in posses
sion as in remainder, reversion, or expectancy. The Court
of Chancery in England, or the Court of Exchequer in
Ireland, or the trustees in whose names the money (where
it is under £200) is deposited, have a discretion, however,
in the disposal of the fund, and may allot to any tenant
for life, or for any other partial or qualified estate, for his
own use, a portion of the same, as compensation for any
injury, inconvenience, or annoyance, which he may be
considered to sustain, independently of the actual value of
the lands to be taken, and of the damage occasioned to
the lands held therewith, by reason of the taking of such
lands and the making of the works (c).
Where a Railway Act contained a provision that the
purchase money of lands bought of corporations, tenants
for life, &c., might be laid out in the redemption of the
land-tax of other lands settled to the same uses as those

purchased, the Court of Chancery permitted a tenant for
life, who had redeemed the land-tax of the property sold
before the passing of the Act, to be reimbursed out of the
proceeds (a).
Purchase money or compensation deposited in the Bank,
which has been paid in respect of any lease for a life, or
lives, or years, or for a life, or lives, and years, or any
estate in the lands less than the fee simple thereof, or for
any reversion dependent on such lease or estate, on peti
tion to the court into which the money has been paid by
any party interested, may be laid out in such manner as
the court may consider most equitable among the several
claimants, according to their respective interests in the
estate (b).
When the owner of any lands purchased by the com
pany refuses the purchase money and compensation agreed
or awarded to be paid in respect of the same, and fails or
neglects to make out a title to such lands, or to the inte
rest which he claims therein, and refuses to convey or re
lease the same to the promoters; in such cases, the amount
must be paid into the Bank, as before mentioned, to the
credit of the parties interested, subject to the control and
disposal of the court.(c)
Under this section, the refusal to make out a title or
to execute a conveyance must be after the amount of com
pensation has been agreed on or awarded, since it has been
held that the words of a clause similar to the above ap
plied to a refusal to show title after such agreement or
award, and at the time when the money became payable,
and that the fact of the owner not making out a title before
the inquisition is not sufficient to give the company a right
to deposit the money, and enter on the lands, immediately
after the finding by the jury, but that they must before

But where a party whose lands were required for the pur
poses of a railway company refused to agree with the com
pany for the sale and purchase thereof, after due notice,
and who neglected, after notice, to attend the inquiry be
fore a jury, held on the 27th of November, and the com
pany on the 21st of June following, the owner still refus
ing to convey, paid the sum awarded into the Bank, under
the provisions of their act of incorporation, and entered on
the lands; on ejectment brought by the owner, it was
decided, that there was reasonable evidence of a neglect
and refusal to convey, so as to justify the company in the
steps they had taken. (b)
A railway company, although they may have entered
into an agreement with a landowner for the purchase of
land, are not therefore precluded from afterwards disputing
his title, and refusing to pay the money to him, as the
previous agreement cannot be considered as amounting to
an approval of his title, in the absence of any formal ac
ceptance of it, and hence they may, on depositing the
money in court, as in other cases of disputed title, enter
on the lands. (c) Nor would they be bound by such a

So, if the owner be absent from the kingdom, or after
diligent inquiry cannot be found; or if he fail to appear,
after due notice, when the jury are summoned to assess
compensation, then the purchase-money or compensation
is to be deposited as aforesaid.
On petition, by any party entitled, the Court into which
the money has been paid may, in a summary way, order
the same to be invested or distributed, or the dividends
and interest to be apportioned according to the respective
estates and interests of the parties making a claim (b).
The parties who at the time when the lands were pur
chased were in possession of them as the owners thereof,
or in receipt of the rents as being entitled thereto, are to
be deemed the lawful owners thereof, until the contrary be
shewn to the satisfaction of the Court; and, unless the
contrary be shewn, the parties so in possession, and all
parties claiming under them, or consistently with their
possession, shall be deemed entitled to the money so depo
sited, or to the dividends and interest thereof, which will
be paid to them accordingly (c). -
When a company, having contracted to purchase a piece
of land of the party in possession, and having entered into
possession under the contract, afterwards objected to the
title, and paid the money into Court to the credit of the
party with whom they had so contracted; it was held that
such party, upon hisown affidavit oftitle, was entitled to pay

Costs of pay

Of application
for reinvest
ment.
In all the cases above mentioned of the payment of
monies into Court (except that of wilful refusal to accept
the same, and convey and release the lands, and of wilful
neglect to make out a good title), the expenses incident to
the deposit may be ordered by the Court to be paid by the
promoters. Such expenses are to include the costs of the
purchase or taking of the lands, or which shall have been
incurred in consequence thereof, and the cost of investing
such monies in government (a) or real securities, including
broker's commission (b), and of the re-investment in the
purchase of other lands, and also the costs of obtaining
the proper orders for any of those purposes, and for the
payment of interest or principal to the parties entitled,
and of all proceedings relating thereto, except such as are
occasioned by litigation between adverse claimants (c).
The costs of only one application for reinvesting the
money in lands will be allowed; except in those cases in
which the Court may be of opinion that it is for the benefit
of the parties interested in the money, that it should be
laid out in the purchase of lands in different sums and at
different times; when it is in the discretion of the Court to
order such costs as may be thereby incurred, to be paid by
the promoters of the undertaking(d). The whole policy and
the main object of these provisions is perfectly to indem
nify the party whose lands are taken from him under
compulsory powers. Therefore where part of the purchase
money remained in Court to await the decision of con
tested claims, the Eastern Counties Railway Company

provisions, held liable to pay the costs of the application of
the person rightly entitled to have the money paid to him.
Vice-Chancellor Wigram says, “The 48th section of the
Act gives the Court power to order the reasonable costs of
the parties, incurred in procuring the payment of their
purchase money out of Court, to be paid by the company.
The question here has arisen in consequence of the state
of the property, a state in which the parties had a right to
place it. It is clear that the Court has jurisdiction to
order the costs to be paid, and it is the duty of the Court
to give the costs, unless a special case is made out; other
wise the party has his estate diminished by its being taken
from him by the company against his will. The company,
however, are not to pay the costs of a party who claims,
and turns out not to be entitled to the fund; yet the com
pany must pay the costs of all persons who properly claim
and are entitled to the fund, that is, the costs and charges
properly incurred” (a).
So where power was reserved to the Court to order the
reasonable expenses of reinvesting a sum of money in the
bank, the produce of land purchased by the company, to
be paid by the company, the Court will order the costs of
two applications for reinvestment of parts of the same sum,
to be paid by the company (b). So where the entire pur
chase money was very large, the costs of a third reinvest
ment were allowed to the vendor (c). But it has been
held, under a similar provision in a Special Railway Act,
that the costs of getting the money out of Court can only
be made payable by the company in cases when such
monies are to be reinvested in the manner specifically de
clared by the Act; thus when the company, in consequence
of taking a part, were compelled to purchase the whole of

the glebe land in a certain parish, and the vicar was em
powered, under certain conditions, to lay out a portion of
the money in purchasing or erecting a new vicarage house,
but the Act did not declare by whom the costs of getting
the money out of Court for this purpose should be de
frayed; the Court held that the company were not liable
to pay them (a). So when the petitioner sought to invest
the sum paid into Court, added to another sum to be pro
vided by him, in the purchase of other property, the Court
held that the company ought not to pay the costs of such
investment, nor of the application for that purpose (b).
SEC. W.—Conveyances.
Upon tender, payment, or deposit in the bank, of the
purchase money agreed upon, assessed, awarded, or claimed,
and a requisition to that effect to the owners, or parties
enabled to convey the lands, the promoters of the under
taking may require a conveyance thereof to be duly exe
cuted.
The Lands’ Clauses Consolidation Act provides forms for
the conveyance of lands purchased under the provisions of
the Act, but allows the company to have a deed of convey
ance in any form which they may approve. If either of the
forms given in the schedule to the Act be adopted, the effect
of it, on being executed, is to vest the lands thereby con
veyed in the company; and it will also operate to merge
all terms of years attendant on the estate or interest so
conveyed, whether by express declaration or construction
of law; and to bar and destroy all such estates tail, and all

other estates, rights, titles, remainders, reversions, limita
tions, trusts, and interests, whatsoever of and in the lands
comprised in such conveyance, which shall have been pur
chased or compensated for by the consideration therein
mentioned. The terms, though merged, will afford the same
protection to the estate as though they had been kept on
foot, and assigned to a trustee for the company, to attend
the reversion and inheritance (a).
A conveyance of copyhold lands to the company must
be enrolled in the usual way in the Manor Court (b).
Any interest in the estate conveyed which has been
overlooked, or not purchased, will not pass by the con
veyance nor become vested in the promoters. In such
cases provision is made for correcting the omission (c).
The costs of all such conveyances are to be borne by
the promoters; and they include all charges and expenses,
incurred on the part as well of the seller as of the pur
chaser, of all conveyances and assurances of any lands,
and of any outstanding terms or interests therein; and of
deducing, evidencing, and verifying, the title to such
lands, terms, or interests; and of making out and furnish
ing such abstracts and attested copies as the promoters of
the undertaking may require; and all other reasonable
expenses incident to the investigation, deduction, and
verification of the title (d).
But if the owner of lands contracted to be sold by pri
vate agreement to the company, subsequently to such
agreement, either do, or omit to do, an act whereby the
legal estate in the land is altered previous to the con
veyance to the company, the expense thereby incurred
will fall upon the estate, and may be deducted from the
purchase-money. Thus, where an Act of Parliament im
posed on a railway company the obligation of paying all

the expenses relating to the conveyance of lands, it was
held that this provision did not include the expenses of a
suit in Chancery, rendered necessary by the death of the
landowner, after he had contracted for the sale of his
lands to the company, whereby the legal estate therein
descended to infants; but the costs ofthe suit, having been
incurred through the fault of the deceased, were decreed
to be defrayed out of the purchase-money (a).
In the absence of any decision on the point we may
conclude, that although the lands are taken by the com
pany under their compulsory powers, the same rules as to
costs incurred by default of the proprietors would be up
held; for the company being, from the time of the service
of notice upon the proprietors, the equitable owners of the
lands comprised therein (b), it would be the fault of the
landowner if he, knowing that the company would be the
purchasers of the particular land, did not take steps to
prevent the legal estate from passing into other hands.
Any dispute as to the amount of the costs of a convey
ance is to be settled by one of the Taxing-Masters of the
Court of Chancery; and the costs of the taxation are to
be borne by the promoters, unless one-sixth part of the
amount claimed be disallowed, in which case they shall be
deducted from the amount allowed (c).
This provision for taxation of costs under the sta
tute, however, would seem to apply only in cases where
the lands have been purchased under the compulsory
powers of the Act, and no agreement has been made with
the vendor as to the payment of costs. Therefore, where
it appeared that a special agreement had been entered
into between the parties, and the company applied by
motion, under a similar clause in one of their Acts, for an

order of reference to tax a bill of costs sent in by the
solicitor of a person of whom the company had purchased
land; the Court refused the motion with costs, on the
ground that on an application of this sort it had not an
opportunity of considering, whether, under the terms of
the agreement, the question of costs was, or was not, with
in the jurisdiction of the Court (a).
A stamp duty, as in ordinary cases, is payable upon the
conveyances to a company under the provisions of their
Special Act, or of any Act incorporated therewith.
If the parties whose duty it is to convey the lands, ob
stinately refuse, or neglect, or become incapable of doing
so, the company are empowered (if they think fit) on de
posit of the amount of compensation agreed or awarded,
to effect the conveyance by a deed poll. This must be
under their common seal, if they be incorporated, or, if
not, then under the hands and seals of two or more of
them (b). It should recite all the material facts of the
transaction, the purchase of the lands, with a full descrip
tion of them; the names of the parties from whom pur
chased; the deposit of the purchase-money and amount
thereof, and the fact of default being made. This deed
must be stamped with the stamp duty which would have
been payable had it been an ordinary conveyance to the
company (c).
In default of conveyance by the owners to the com
pany of lands, the value of which has been assessed by a
jury under the provisions of the 8 Vict. c. 18, it will not
be absolutely necessary for the latter to execute a deed
poll as above prescribed in order to give them a title to
the land, because the verdict and judgment before the sheriff
are by the statute made a record of the Court of Quar
ter Sessions, and will be conclusive evidence of the title

of the company to the lands mentioned therein (a). But
where no conveyance is made to the company of property
which has been valued by a surveyor, or the compensa
tion for which has been ascertained by arbitration, it is
desirable for the company to convey by a deed-poll, in the
form given by the statute, although it is not imperative
upon them to do so (b).
Under this document, all the estate and interest which
could have passed, or been conveyed by the parties therein
named, is to vest fully and absolutely in the promoters,
and against them and those for whom they were enabled
to sell and convey, the promoters become entitled to im
mediate possession (c).
This deed poll is to remain in the possession of the
company, but they would probably be held liable to allow
inspection to any parties claiming an interest in the lands
thereby conveyed.
All the costs of this mode of conveyance are to be borne
by the promoters.
The death of the vendor, before the contract is com
pletely executed and the purchase-money paid by the com
pany, may sometimes render necessary the assistance of a
Court of Equity, to procure a conveyance of the lands.
Thus, where a railway company, under the provisions of
their Act, were empowered to take lands, and the company
gave notice of their intention to treat, to A, who was at
that time and continued until his death in an imbecile
state of mind, and previously to becoming imbecile, he had
made a will, whereby he gave and bequeathed all his pro
perty, real and personal, to his wife for life, and, after her
decease, to his children equally, and died before the pur

(which had been assessed by a jury) had been paid; it was
held that the railway company could not pay over the
purchase-money, or procure a conveyance, except under
the direction of a Court of Equity (a).
SEC. VI.—Entry on Lands.
(1) When it may be made.
IN those cases in which the amount of purchase-money
and compensation has been either agreed on or awarded,
the company may not enter upon the lands until that
amount has been tendered or paid, except by consent (b).
But if the parties refuse to accept it, or to convey the
lands, or to make a title, or if they cannot be found, then,
on the deposit thereof in the bank as before-mentioned,
the company will be entitled to enter.
With regard to the right of a company to enter on the
lands, after deposit of the purchase-money in the bank,
in cases where they are not satisfied with the title of the
vendor, or he has neglected or refused to make out his
title; it has been decided, on the construction of a clause
similar to section 76 of the Lands’ Clauses Act, that the
refusal or neglect to make out title must be subsequent to
the agreement, assessment, or award of the amount of
compensation, and when it becomes payable; and that a
failure to disclose such title at any previous period will not
authorize the company to deposit the purchase-money,
without calling upon the owner, after the amount of com
pensation has been ascertained or agreed, to make out his
title—for although a party may be unable at first to make

out his title, he may afterwards be enabled to do so, and
ought, therefore, to have the opportunity. An entry after
such unauthorized deposit would be illegal, and the com
pany would be liable to be ejected from the lands (a). So
where a railway company, the provisions of whose Act were
similar to those under consideration, entered into an agree
ment with a landholder for the purchase of lands on the
line of railway, and before acceptance of title, or payment,
tender, or deposit of the purchase-money, entered upon
the land; it was held by the Vice-chancellor that such entry
was illegal. But it was also held by the Vice-chancellor,
and by the Lord Chancellor affirming his Honour’s decision
that this was not a case within the Act, but rather a case
for specific performance; and that on payment of the
purchase-money into the Court in which the bill was filed,
thereby securing it on behalf of the owner, in case he
should succeed in making out his title, the company were
entitled to enter, and that an injunction which had been
obtained ex parte should thereupon be dissolved (b). *
In cases in which no agreement has been entered into,
with regard to the amount of the purchase-money and
compensation, nor any award thereof made, or verdict
given, and the promoters are anxious to enter upon the
lands before the preliminaries can be concluded; they are
at liberty to do so on certain prescribed terms. They
must deposit in the bank, by way of security, the amount
of purchase-money and compensation claimed by any party
entitled to sell the lands, and who objects to their entry;
or such a sum as shall be determined to be the value of
the lands, or of the interest of the party therein, by a sur
veyor appointed by two justices, as in the case of persons
absent from the kingdom, or who cannot be found (c).

of such a sum as may be determined, in the manner pre
scribed in cases of disputed compensation, to be payable
by the promoters in respect of such lands, together with
interest thereon at five per cent. per annum, from the time
of entry until the time of the payment or deposit of the
money (a).
On depositing this sum, therefore, as a security, and on
delivering or tendering to the non-consenting party a bond
as above-mentioned, the promoters of the undertaking may
enter on the lands, before the usual preliminaries are
complied with.
A receipt will be given for the money paid into the
bank, in the name of the accountant-general of the Court
of Chancery by way of security, and it will remain there
until disposed of at the discretion of the Court (b).
Whilst the office of the accountant-general is closed,
the money may be paid into the bank to the credit of the
party interested, on the permission of the governor and
company of the Bank of England, and of which their
cashier will give a certificate on receiving the money (c).
In cases where a railway company are entitled to enter
on and take possession of any lands for the purposes of
the Act, and the owner or occupier obstructs that entry
and refuses to give up possession, the promoters may issue a
warrant to the sheriff to deliver possession of the lands to
the person therein-named, upon the receipt of which he
will deliver possession accordingly (d). The effect of this

warrant is similar to that of habere facias possessionem in

The costs of this proceeding are to be settled by the
sheriff, and paid by the party refusing possession, and the
amount of them deducted and retained by the promoters
out of any compensation which may be then due from
them to the party. If no compensation be then payable,
or it be less in amount than the costs; the costs, or excess,

Having detailed the various preliminaries to the rightful
entry of a railway company upon the lands necessary for
the purposes of the line, and which they are authorized by
their Act to take, we shall now advert to the steps which
landowners may adopt, where there has either been an
illegal entry on the part of a company, or where, the entry
having been legal, the company proceed in excess of their
authority in their mode of dealing with the land. When
there has been a wrongful entry, the promoters may be
treated by the landowner as trespassers, and be visited with
the penalties inflicted by the statute, or have an action of
trespass, case, or ejectment, brought against them; or an
injunction would be granted to restrain them from making
any use of the land entered upon. But where the entry
into possession was not illegal, but the subsequent pro
ceedings of the company are such as are not authorized by
their Special Act, they may be restrained by injunction.
We shall treat of these in their order (b).
(2) Consequences of Illegal Entry.
In addition to the actions at common law to which the
promoters are liable, the 8 Vict. c. 18 has imposed certain
(a) 8 Vic, c. 18, s. 91.
(b) See further on this subject post, chapter on “Remedies.”
CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 245
penalties upon them for any wrongful entry upon lands.
Thus if the promoters of the company, by themselves or
by their servants and employers, wilfully enter upon and
take possession of any lands which shall be required per
manently for the purposes of the railway without having
paid or tendered the purchase money, as before mentioned,
or made such deposit as by law required, in certain cases,
by way of security; a penalty of £10. is payable by the
company, over and above the amount of the damage done
to the lands. Both the penalty and the damage may be
recovered before two justices, by the party in possession
of the lands (a).
If after that, the company persist in retaining possession
of the lands, they will incur a penalty of £25. to the party.
in possession, for every day of their unlawful continuance
in possession. This may be recovered, with costs, by action
in any of the superior Courts. The company, however, are
not to be liable to the above penalties in any case where
they have bond fide, and without any collusion, paid the
amount of the compensation and purchase money agreed
upon or awarded, in respect of such lands, to any person
whom they may reasonably have believed to be entitled to
such money; or have deposited the same in the bank for
the benefit of the parties interested, or made such deposit
by way of security (b). It has been decided under a clause
in a Railway Act, very similar to the one under consider
ation, that where the company had, before entry on the
plaintiff's land, bond fide, and without collusion, paid the
money awarded by a jury into the Bank of England to the
credit of the plaintiff, they were protected from the penal
ties of an illegal entry and continuance in possession,
although they had not complied with all the requisites of
the statute (c). Penal clauses in an Act will be strictly

construed; but a proviso which has the effect of saving
parties from penal enactments, should be liberally con
strued (a). In an action to recover any penalty for a
wrongful entry on lands, the decision of the justices will
not be conclusive as to the right of the promoters to
enter (b).
Injunction is a remedy given to landowners both when
there has been an original wrongful entry on their lands by
the company, and also when, though the entry were lawful,
there is a wrongful user of the lands taken. In general,
with regard to the purchase and taking of lands under
compulsory powers, the Courts of Equity will interfere, by
injunction, to prevent railway companies from availing
themselves of their parliamentary powers to take and enter
upon lands not required for a bond fide purpose sanctioned
by their Act. Nevertheless, although the first attempt to
take the lands, under colour of the powers of the Act of
Parliament, was for a purpose not contemplated by the
Act; yet if afterwards it become really necessary or de
sirable to take the land for a bond fide purpose, the Court
will not interfere to prevent its being taken (c). So Courts
of Equity will restrain railway companies from entering upon
lands to be taken for the purposes of their Act, until the
amount of compensation agreed on or awarded, be paid (d).
An injunction, however, will be refused, in a case where
the money is not paid to the party with whom the contract
has been made, because the company is not satisfied with
his title; and on payment of the purchase money into the
"Court in which the bill is filed, the company will be al
lowed to take possession (e).

right, the course adopted is, “to put the parties into a
situation to try as quickly as possible that legal right,
and to protect the property to be affected until the legal
right be ascertained” (a).
Laches, or apparent acquiescence on the part of the
plaintiff, will prevent his obtaining an injunction; there
fore the owner of land upon which a railway company
empowered by Act of Parliament were about to enter, was
held not entitled to an interlocutory injunction to restrain
them from so doing, if by his silence and conduct he has
permitted the company to carry on their works upon the
supposition that they were entitled to enter on and take
the land in question (b).
So a subsequent treating with a railway company will
be considered by the Court as a waiver of objections to pro
ceedings on the subject of the treaty, although those pro
ceedings are not in fact authorised by the Railway Act;
therefore,where a party, upon whose fields arailwaycompany
had entered without notice, or permission, filed a bill, and
applied for an injunction to restrain them from digging
away a part of one field, and depositing it on a certain
other field; but it appeared that he had been disposed to
treat in respect of the land, and that the steps taken by
the company were necessary for the public safety, the Court
refused the injunction, upon their undertaking to pay into
Court the probable value of the land taken (c).
In cases of trespass under colour of title, when the mis
chief apprehended is irreparable, a Court of Equity will
exercise its jurisdiction to grant an injunction; and, whe
ther the mischief be irreparable or not, it will, by decree,
if not by order upon motion, extend the jurisdiction of
preventivejustice to all cases of trespass in which damages
would be an inadequate and uncertain remedy; and the

SEC. VII.—Proceedings in respect of Lands subject to
Public, Quasi-Public, and Peculiar Rights and Burdens.
HAvING hitherto treated generally of the steps to be taken
in assessing compensation, and obtaining possession of
lands by a railway company, we now proceed to notice
more particularly certain classes of property in respect of
which the Lands Clauses’ Act has made special provisions,
and which require, therefore, some further comment.
Of these, the most important are copyhold lands, and
lands subject to rights of common, or to public burdens, as
land-tax and poor's-rate; in obtaining possession of which
a company will be compelled to follow certain prescribed
rules adopted specially to the circumstances of each case.
(1) Copyholds.
All conveyances of copyhold lands purchased by a rail
way company must be enrolled in the Manor Court; and
on payment of the fees which would be due to the steward
on the ordinary surrender of such lands to the use of a
purchaser, he will make the enrolment. A conveyance
so enrolled will have the same effect as a conveyance of
freeholds, but the lands will remain subject to the customary
fines and services as before, until they are enfranchised (b).

(b) 8 Vic. c. 18, s. 95.
CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 249
Within three months after the enrolment of the con
veyance as above mentioned, or within one month after
entry on the lands, (or if there be several parcels, entry
on the last,) the promoters must enfranchise the lands,
and pay the compensation agreed upon to the lord of the
manor. In cases of dispute as to the amount of compen
sation it is to be settled as in other cases. In estimating
compensation, the value of fines, heriots, and other ser
vices payable on death, descent, and alienation, and other
manorial rights lost by the conveyance to the company,
are to be allowed for (a).
On the payment or deposit of the money, the lord must
enf anchise; and in case he refuse, a deed poll may be
executed by the company, as in other cases, and there
upon the lands therein comprised are to be deemed
enfranchised (b).
If part only of the lands subject to the customary rents
and services be taken, the apportionment is to be settled
by agreement between the owner of the land and the lord
of the manor, on the one part, and the promoters on the
other part; or in case of difference, by two justices. The
customs affecting lands not taken will not be altered
by the enfranchisement of those which are purchased,
nor will the lord’s rights and remedies in respect of the
former be at all affected (c).
Where lands are purchased by the company of more
than one tenant of the manor, or of one tenant holding
parcels of the manor in several places, it will not be
necessary to make separate agreements for the enfran
chisement of the different parcels, nor to have separate
assessments of compensation; but the whole must be in
cluded in one contract or one inquiry before the jury (d).

(2) As to Common Lands.
When a railway company become the purchasers of
common lands, the claim upon them for compensation is
always twofold; a claim in respect of the right to the
soil, and a claim in respect of the easment to which the
commoners are entitled. These rights may belong to the
same or to different parties; but both must be purchased
in either case, although the mode of assessing compensa
tion will be different. Thus the right to the soil may be
in the commoners, or it may be in some party other than
the commoners, as the lord, or a stranger.
Where lands subject to rights of common are taken
by a company under the compulsory powers of their Act,
the compensation in respect of the right in the soil, if it
belong either to the lord of the manor, or to any party
other than the commoners, is to be assessed and paid in
the manner prescribed generally in respect of other lands
by the 8 Vict, c. 18 (a). The compensation to the com
moners in respect of their rights will then remain to be
ascertained separately.
But where the right to the soil is in the commoners, then
the compensation is to be assessed both for that right and
also for their common rights, as mentioned below; the pur
chase both of the estate and the easement over it being
effected at once. The amount of compensation may be
settled either by agreement or under the compulsory powers
given by the Act. Thus the 101st section of the Lands'
Clauses Act provides that the compensation to be paid in
respect of any lands being common lands, or in the nature
thereof, the right to the soil of which shall belong to the
commoners; as well as the compensation to be paid for the
commonable and other rights in or over common lands,
the right in the soil whereof shall not belong to the com
moners; is to be determined by agreement between the
(a) See supra.
cHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE.
promoters of the undertaking and a committee of the par
ties entitled to commonable or other rights in such lands;
to be appointed in the manner prescribed.
The promoters of the undertaking are to convene a
meeting of the commoners, for the purpose of their ap
pointing a committee to treat with them as to the com
pensation to be paid for the extinction of the commonable
rights. This meeting is to be called by a public adver
tisement, which must be inserted once at least in two
consecutive weeks in some newspaper circulating in the
county or neighbourhood in which the lands are situate,
the last insertion being not more than fourteen nor less
than seven days before the meeting. Notices of the
meeting must be also affixed to the church door (or other
usual place of affixing notices) of the parish in which it is
to be held, not less than seven days previous to the hold
ing thereof; and if the common lands be parcel of a
manor, the lord is also entitled to notice (a). This
meeting, when convened (a majority of which will bind
the minority and absent parties), is to appoint a com
mittee of the commoners, consisting of not more than
five persons (b).
The committee thus appointed are to be deemed the
representatives of the whole body, and are to treat with
the promoters as to the amount of compensation to
be paid; and their agreement will be binding on all
the parties interested. The money is to be paid to
them, and their receipt (or that of three of them), will be
an effectual discharge to the company. The committee is
then to apportion the compensation among the parties inter
ested; but the company are not responsible for that appor
tionment, nor for the application of such compensation (c).
If the committee of commoners appointed to contract
with the company cannot agree as to the compensation to
be paid by the latter; or if there be no effectual meeting

of the parties interested, and therefore no committee is
appointed to negotiate, the company must obtain possess
sion of the lands under their compulsory powers, and
assess their value in the manner prescribed by their Act.
Where the committee and the promoters cannot agree,
the matter is to be settled by arbitration or by ajury, as in
other cases of disputed compensation (a).
If no committee, however, should be appointed by the
commoners, and there be, in fact, no party with whom
the company can treat; the amount of compensation is
to be determined by a surveyor, nominated by two jus
tices, as in the case of parties who cannot be found (b).
The compensation for the right to the soil in common
lands is to be paid to the lord of the manor, or to the
party entitled; and on payment, or tender thereof, a con
veyance shall be executed to the company, the effect of
which shall be to vest the lands in them in the same
manner as if the party conveying had been seized in fee
simple. On neglect or refusal to convey, the company
may execute a deed-poll, duly stamped, to operate as a
conveyance, as in other cases where landowners neglect
or refuse to convey. The lands being so vested in the
company, they will be entitled to immediate possession;
subject, nevertheless, to the commonable and other rights
theretofore affecting the same, until such rights shall have
been extinguished by payment or deposit of the amount
of compensation (c).
Compensation for the commonable rights is to be paid
(as we have seen) to the committee appointed by the com
moners, or three of them; or, if there shall be no com
mittee, then the money is to be deposited in the bank as
in other cases. Upon such payment, or deposit, the com
pany may execute a deed-poll, and thereupon the lands
comprehended therein, will vest in the promoters freed
(a) 8 Vic. c 18, s. 105. (b) Idem, s. 106.
(c) Idem, s. 100.

and discharged from all commonable or other rights, and
they will be entitled to immediate possession (a).
The Court of Chancery in England, and the Court of
Exchequer in Ireland, may by order, on petition, direct
the payment of the money so deposited to a committee
to be appointed by the commoners; or make such other
order in respect thereof for the benefit of the parties in
terested as it shall think fit (b).
It thus appears, that although there had been no effec
tual meeting of commoners convened, and no committee
had been appointed to negotiate with the company as to
the amount of compensation to be paid, (which has been
ascertained, in consequence, in other ways); yet the parties
interested may afterwards appoint a committee to receive
the money deposited in the bank, and to apportion it
among the several claimants.
(3.) Lands subject to Land Tax and Poor's Rate.
Where a railway company have become possessed of
lands charged with the land-tax, or liable to be assessed
to the poor's rate, they will be liable, until the works
shall have been completed and assessed to such land-tax
or poor’s rate, to make good the deficiency which shall
have been caused in those assessments by reason of their
having become possessed of the lands. The deficiency is
to be computed according to the rental at which such
lands, with any buildings thereon, were valued or rated at
the time of the passing of the Special Act. The pro
moters may, however, redeem the land-tax if they think
fit, in accordance with the powers in that behalf given by
the Acts for the redemption of the land-tax (c).
The above provisions leave no doubt either as to the
liability of a railway company to poor’s rate, or as to the

amount thereof, up to the period of the works being com
pleted, and the railway itself assessed.
For the elucidation of the principles on which a
railway company will be rated when the railroad is
finished and in operation, we refer to a subsequent
chapter.
SEC. VIII.—Lands subject to Private Rights and Burdens.
(1.) Lands in Mortgage.
WHERE lands required for the purposes of a railway
company are subject to mortgage, the promoters of the
undertaking may redeem the interest of the mortgage,
whether they shall have previously purchased the equity of
redemption or not; and whether or not the mortgagee
be entitled thereto in his own right or in trust for
another, and whether or not he is in possession of the
lands, and whether the mortgage affect such lands solely,
or jointly with any other lands not required for the pur
poses of the Act (a).
In order to redeem the mortgage, the company must pay
or tender to the mortgagee the amount of the principal and
interest due, together with his costs, and six months’ addi
tional interest; and thereupon the mortgagee shall convey
his interest to the company; or the company may give six
months’ notice to pay off the mortgage. And if they or
the owner of the equity of redemption have given such a
notice, then, at the expiration thereof, or at any interme
diate time, upon payment or tender of the principal and
the interest which would become due at the end of the
six months, together with costs, the mortgagee must con
vey or release his interest to the promoters (b).
(a) Payment
of mortgage
generally.
(a) 8 Vic. c. 18, s. 108. (b) Idem.
CHAP. I.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 255
If the mortgagee fail to convey or to show a good title,
the promoters may deposit the purchase-money in the bank
as in other cases of the like kind, and may thereupon exe
cute a deed poll, by which the interest of the mortgagee in
the lands shall become vested in them, and they shall be
at once entitled to possession if the mortgagee were him
self entitled to possession (a). The deed must be stamped
as in ordinary cases.
In cases where the lands in mortgage are of less value
than the principal, interest, and costs secured thereon, the
amount of compensation to be paid is to be settled between
the promoters of the company on the one side, and the
mortgagor (or party entitled to the equity of redemption)
and mortgagee on the other side, by agreement, or, if they
cannot agree, then such amount is to be determined as in
ordinary cases of disputed compensation. The sum so
ascertained and settled is to be paid to the mortgagee, in
satisfaction of his debt, so far as it will extend, upon pay
ment or tender of which he shall at once convey and re
lease his interest in the lands to the company (b).
Upon his refusal to convey, or failing to adduce a good
title, the money may be deposited in the bank, and a deed
poll executed by the promoters, as above-mentioned. This
deed, however, will not affect any rights which the mort
gagee may have against the mortgagor, in respect of so
much of the mortgage debt as remains unsatisfied; but all
rights and remedies between those parties, by virtue of any
bond, or contract, or other obligation, except the right to
the lands, will remain in full force (c). -
When a part only of the lands is required for the
purposes of the Act, and that part is of less value than
the principal money, interest, and costs secured on
such lands, and the mortgagee does not consider the re
maining part of such lands as sufficient security for the
money charged thereon, or is unwilling to release the part

so required, then the value of the required portion, and the
amount of compensation to be paid in respect of the
severance, or otherwise, is to be settled by agreement
between the mortgagor (or party entitled to the equity
of redemption) and mortgagee, and the promoters; or re
ferred to arbitration, or assessed by a jury. The sum,
so settled, is to be paid to the mortgagee in satisfac
tion of his mortgage debt, so far as it will extend; and,
on payment or tender thereof, he shall convey and re
lease his interest in the purchased land. A memoran
dum of the sum so paid is to be endorsed on the mortgage
deed, and signed by the mortgagee; and a copy thereof,
to be furnished by the promoters, and at their expense,
may be required by the party entitled to the equity of
redemption (a).
On the refusal of the mortgagee to convey, the promoters
have the power, as before-mentioned, of executing a deed
poll on the deposit of the money in the bank.
The mortgagee will, however, retain the same powers and
remedies for recovery or compelling payment of the mort
gage money, or the residue thereof, out of the residue of
the lands as he previously possessed in respect of the
whole (b).
Wherever any lands subject to mortgages are taken for
the purposes of a railway, and in the mortgage deeds a
time is limited for the payment of the mortgage money,
the promoters of the undertaking must, if they pay off
the money before the expiration of that period, bear all the
costs and expenses incident to a reinvestment of the sum;
and if any dispute arise as to their amount, it is to be
settled by one of the taxing-masters of the Court of
Chancery, and the costs of the taxation are to be paid by
the promoters, unless one-sixth part of the sum demanded
be taxed off, in which case they shall be deducted from
the amount allowed (c).

CHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 257
If the rate of interest secured by the mortgage deed is
higher than could be reasonably expected to be obtained
on reinvestment, regard being had to the current rate of
interest at the time of the money being paid off, then the
mortgagee is entitled to compensation for the loss sus
tained by the premature paying off of his mortgage, which
must be paid by the promoters before they can enter on
possession of the lands. If the amount is disputed, it is
to be settled as in other cases of disputed compensation (a).
(2.) Lands subject to Rent-charge.
WHERE the lands required are charged with any rent
service, rent-charge, or chief or other rent, or any other
payment or incumbrance not specially provided for in the
Lands' Clauses Act, any differences as to the amount of
consideration for the release thereof, are to be settled by
arbitration or assessment by a jury, as in other cases (b).
If part only of the lands so encumbered are required,
the apportionment is to be settled by agreement between
the owner of the lands and the owner of the rent-charge
on the one part, and the company on the other; and if
they differ, the dispute must be settled by two justices.
If the remaining portion of the lands be a sufficient
security for the charge, then, with the consent of the
owner thereof, the party entitled to the rent-charge may
release the lands required, on consideration of the other
lands remaining subject to the whole of it. The rent
charge, or so much of it as remains unredeemed, will be
chargeable on the remaining lands, and the owner thereof
will have his ancient rights and remedies for the recovery
of it (c).
Should there be any refusal to release after tender or
payment of the money, the consequences of it may be

obviated as in other cases, by deposit in the bank and
a deed poll, the effect of which shall be to extinguish the
rent-charge in respect of the lands therein comprised (a).
The promoters of the undertaking, (or two of them,) on
being required to do so, must subscribe a memorandum,
to be endorsed on the instrument creating or transferring
the charge, specifying the lands which have been pur
chased, or the portion of the charge which has been
released, and the sum still remaining payable in respect
of the remaining lands, or stating that the whole rent
charge is now chargeable upon such remaining lands.
This memorandum is to be under the seal of the company,
if incorporated, and is to be made and executed at their
expense; and it will be evidence, in all courts of justice
and elsewhere, of the facts therein stated, but not so as to
exclude any other evidence of the same facts (b).
(3.) Lands under Lease.
In regard to lands subject to lease, which may be
required for the purposes of a railway, similar provisions
are contained in the Lands' Clauses Consolidation Act,
as in respect of lands subject to mortgage or rent-charge.
If only part of the lands comprised in a lease for a term
of years unexpired, be required, the rent payable in
respect of them is to be apportioned between the lands to
be purchased and the residue of them. If the parties
cannot agree as to the apportionment, it must be settled
by two justices. After the apportionment has been made,
the lessee will only be liable to so much of the rent as
shall be apportioned to the residue of the lands remaining
in his possession; and in respect of such lands, the lessor's
rights and remedies will remain as they were before. All
the customs and conditions and agreements of the lease,
(except as regards the rent) will remain unaltered, and
(a) 8 Vic. c. 18, s. 117. (b) Idem, s. 118.
CIIAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 259
continue in full force between the lessor and the lessee (a).
The lessee will be entitled to compensation for the damage
done to him in his tenancy by reason of the severance of
the lands required from those not required, and otherwise
by reason of the execution of the works (b).
Tenants for a year, or from year to year, if ejected by
the company before the expiration of their terms, are en
titled to compensation for the unexpired portion thereof,
and for any just allowances which ought to be made to
them by incoming tenants, and for any loss or injury
which they may sustain. If the amount of compensation
is disputed, it must be settled by two justices, and, on ten
der or payment thereof, possession of the lands is to be
given to the company (c).
In addition to the cases cited above (d), with regard to
the nature of the interests for which compensation may be
demanded of a railway company, the following have been
decided:—
Where a tenant from year to year was ejected by a no
tice from the company, expiring at the end of his tenancy,
he was held not entitled to compensation. The situation
of the parties is then the same as if a regular notice to
quit had been given by the landlord. A company giving
such a notice, expiring at the end of the current year,
would not be liable to make compensation to the tenant.
Nor, if after giving a notice intended to operate under the
Act, and not ending with the current year of the tenancy,
the company withdraw their notice and give an ordinary
landlord’s notice, or give permission to the tenant to con
tinue until the regular expiration of his tenancy, and he
avail himself of that permission, will the company be liable
to make him any compensation. To entitle himself to
compensation, the premises must be given up (e).

pensation to tenants for the value of their unexpired term
or interest, gave notice to one whose lease had been seve
ral times renewed for seven years, and who, at the last
renewal, had been assured by his landlord that he should
not be turned out at the end of the seven years; but
meanwhile the landlord died, having sold his reversion to
the company, and the company gave notice to the tenant
to quit at the end of his term, the Court held that he had
no claim to compensation under the Act (a).
Notice to quit given to a tenant by a company, which
expires before the time at which the tenancy might have
been determined, will not alter his position in respect to
his landlord, nor vary his liability for rent. He will be
liable, therefore, to the payment of the rent for the inter
val between the time of eviction by the company and the
proper expiration of the tenancy, although he had neither
claimed nor received any compensation from the company
in respect thereof. Therefore, when a tenant is ejected
from premises by a notice to quit, given by a railway
company under the powers of their Act, and such notice
expires three months before the termination of the cur
rent year of the tenancy, the tenant was held liable to
his landlord for the rent up to the end of the current
year, although he had neglected to claim the compensa
tion to which he was entitled on giving up possession (b).
Where a party claims compensation for any unexpired
term or interest greater than that of a tenant at will, the
promoters may require him to produce the lease or grant
under which he claims, or to give the best evidence thereof
that is in his power. If, after notice in writing to that
effect, he fail to produce such document, or evidence
of it, he will be considered and treated as only a tenant
from year to year, and be entitled to compensation ac
cordingly (c).

(1.)—Interests omitted to be purchased.
WHERE the promoters of an undertaking, having entered
upon lands which they were authorised to purchase for the
purposes of their Act, shall, at any time afterwards, dis
cover that some estate, right, or interest in, or charge
upon, such lands has, by mistake or inadvertence, been
omitted to be purchased, they shall be at liberty to con
tinue in possession and to purchase the interest so omit
ted, although the period shall have expired within which
they were authorised to purchase lands (a).
Within six months of receiving notice of the interests
so omitted to be purchased, or within six months of the
final establishment of the right of the claimant by law,
the company must pay compensation for the same, and for
the mesne profits or interest which would have accrued to
the claimant in respect thereof, between the time of the
entry of the promoters and the time of payment, so far as
such mesne profits or interest may be recoverable in law
or equity.
The amount of the compensation is to be settled in the
same manner as it would have been (or as near thereto as
possible) had the purchase taken place before the entry on
the lands (b). The compensation is to be assessed with
a view to the value of the lands at the time of the entry
of the promoters, and not at the time of the assessment
made (c).

claimant, and the dispute has been determined in favour
of the latter, the company must pay the full costs and ex

sale of super- With respect to those portions of land which have been
*lands purchased by a railway company for the purposes of the
Special Acts, and which remain unoccupied and undisposed
of when the line and all the works are complete, the Lands'
Clauses Consolidation Act makes certain provisions.
Notwithstanding the many statutory restrictions as to
the land which a company is empowed to take, it is obvi
ous that a considerable quantity will in most instances re
main in their possession, after the railway and the stations
are finished, which they do not require, and which are of
no use to them. As it is impossible to anticipate exactly
the width of the land which will be necessary for the con
struction of the line, inasmuch as it will depend for the
most part upon the character of the soil and the nature
of the works, whether cuttings or embankments; and as
it is doubtful whether having once served a motice upon a
landowner for a certain quantity of land, the company can
afterwards issue a second notice requiring an additional
quantity (b), it will frequently happen that they will pos
sess themselves of more than is absolutely necessary. So
also, from the effect of special clauses introduced into the
bill by proprietors whose lands will be required, or under
the general provisions of the Lands' Clauses Consolidation
Act with regard to intersected lands, and parts of houses
or other property, the company are compelled to purchase
much more ground at first than will afterwards be found
requisite for the railway works: such superfluous land the
company are not permitted to retain, although they may
(a) 8 Vic. c. 18, s. 126. (b) But see 5 & 6 Wic. c. 55, s. 15.
cHAP. 1.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 263
have been compelled to purchase it. On the contrary,
they must sell and dispose of the whole within the time
limited for that purpose in the Special Act; or if there
be no time therein limited, then within ten years after
the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the
works (a). The purchase money is to be applied to the
purpose of the Special Act. If the promoters fail to sell
the superfluous land within the specified time, then such
as remains unsold will vest absolutely in the proprietors
of the adjoining lands, in proportion to the extent of their
lands respectively adjoining the same (b).
If the land so required to be sold is not within a town,
and not built upon or used for building purposes, the
promoters must first offer it to the party entitled to the
lands (if any) from which it was severed; and on his re
fusal, or if he cannot be found, it must be offered to the
person or persons whose land adjoins the land so proposed
to be sold, provided such persons are capable of contract
ing for the purchase thereof. If more than one party is
entitled to the right of pre-emption, the land is to be
offered to them all in succession, in such order as the
promoters of the undertaking shall think fit (c). The
company are not incapacitated from contracting to sell
lands, although they are incapable of conveying them, be
fore they have offered them to the original owners, or to
adjoining owners, and the Court will decree the specific
performance of such an agreement against the party con
tracting with them. Therefore, when the defendant who
had purchased lands of the company before they had been
offered to the party having the right of pre-emption,
sought to evade the fulfilment of his contract on that
ground, and the company thereupon offered them to the
party entitled, who declined to avail himself of his right,
the Court decided that by the subsequent offer, the
company had set themselves right, and were in a condition

to sell and convey the premises, and that the defendant
was bound to complete his contract (a).
If the party to whom the land is offered, wish to pur
chase it, he must signify his desire to the promoters
within six weeks after the offer is made. If he fail to do
so, or if he refuse the offer, his right of pre-emption ceases.
A declaration in writing made before a justice by a party
not interested, that the offer was made and refused, or not
accepted within six weeks, or that the parties having the
right to it are out of the country, or cannot be found, or
are incapable of contracting for the purchase, will be
sufficient evidence in all Courts of either of these facts (b).
Parties under disability are enabled, by the 7th section
of the Lands' Clauses Consolidation Act, to sell and convey
lands to the company; but there is no enabling clause,
either in that or in the Special Act, in virtue of which par
ties under disability can purchase lands of the company.
Hence, any right of pre-emption which such persons
might have in respect of superfluous land under the above
provisions is a right of which they cannot avail themselves,
so long as they are under disability. For a similar rea
son, it would seem that parties who are absent from the
country, or who cannot be found, must lose their right of
pre-emption.
If the person entitled to the first offer of the land, be
desirous of purchasing it, and cannot agree with the pro
moters as to the sum to be given, it may be settled by
arbitration, the costs of which shall be in the discretion of
the arbitrators (c).
On payment or tender of the purchase money, the com
pany (if incorporated) must convey the lands to the pur
chaser by deed, made under their common seal; or (if
not incorporated) under the hands and seals of the pro
moters of the undertaking, or any two of the directors or

and thereupon the interest in the lands purchased shall
vest in the purchaser. A receipt under the common seal
of the company, or otherwise (as the case may be), will be
an effectual discharge to the purchasers for the amount so
acknowledged (a).
In such conveyances by the promoters, the word “grant”
will operate as express covenants on their part, for them
selves and their successors, or for themselves, their heirs,
executors, administrators, and assigns, (as the case may
be), with the respective grantees therein-named, and the
successors, heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns,
of such grantees, according to the quality or nature of
such grants, and of the estate or interest therein expressed
to be thereby conveyed, as follows, except so far as the same
shall be restrained or limited by express words contained in
any such conveyance: that is to say, a covenant that, not
withstanding any act or default done by the promoters of
the undertaking, they were, at the time of the execution of
such conveyance, seized or possessed of the lands or pre
mises thereby granted for an indefeasible estate of inherit
ance in fee-simple, free from all incumbrances done or oc
casioned by them, or otherwise, for such estate or interest
as therein expressed to be thereby granted, free from all
incumbrances done or occasioned by them —
A covenant that the grantee of such lands, his heirs,
successors, executors, administrators, and assigns, (as the
case may be), shall quietly enjoy the same against the pro
moters of the undertaking, and their successors, and all
other persons claiming under them, and be indemnified
and saved harmless by the promoters of the undertaking,
and their successors, from all incumbrances created by the
promoters of the undertaking:—
A covenant for further assurance of such lands, at the
expense of such grantee, his heirs, successors, executors,

as they might do if such covenants were expressly inserted
in such conveyances (a).
No provision being made with respect to the costs of
conveyances in case of the sale of superfluous lands by the
company, it is to be presumed that the usual rule in con
tracts of this description, as between vendor and purchaser,
will prevail. Obviously there is a great distinction between
the case of lands purchased of the owner by the company
under compulsory powers, and lands purchased voluntarily
of the latter by any party willing to buy them. In the
former, the legislature protects the owner so compelled to
part with his property, against all costs and expenses which
are consequent on the exercise of the extraordinary powers
wherewith the company is invested, and make him liable
to none except those incurred by his own extortion or
misconduct. The latter is a mere ordinary case of sale
and purchase, the only difference being that the company
are compelled to sell—a distinction which, as it can have
no relation to the subject of costs, can have no effect to
vary the ordinary rule in regard to them.

objects, are not only authorized under the general and spe
cial Acts respectively relating thereto, to purchase certain
lands for the purposes of the company, but they are also
entrusted with specific rights over property which they are
neither compelled nor empowered to purchase. The exer
cise of those rights is properly subjected to the very strin
gent restrictions and regulations which are contained in
the Railways’ Clauses Act (8 Vic. c. 20), and the Lands'
Clauses Consolidation Act (8 Vic. c. 18). We proceed to
notice, under this head, the various rights which railway
companies may have over the lands of others, the formali
ties prescribed in relation to the exercise of such rights,
and the compensation which they are bound to make for
injuries which may be inflicted upon any parties having an
interest in the lands in respect of which they are to be
exercised. These rights over property not belonging to
the company may be divided into three classes, according
to their nature and extent:—First, Rights to the tempo
rary occupation and use of lands; Secondly, Rights to
make permanent alterations in and upon such lands; and,
Thirdly, Rights to vary and restrict the rights of others
over their property. We shall treat of them in their
order.

the lands of other parties without their consent, for the
purpose of surveying and taking levels of such lands, and
of probing, or boring, to ascertain the nature of the soil,
and of setting out the line of works (a).
Before entering for these purposes, notices must be
given to the owners or occupiers, not less than three, nor
more than fourteen, days previous to such entry; and
compensa'ion must be made by the company for any
damage which may be occasioned thereby to the owners
or occupiers (b).
So the company may, within the time allowed for the
completion of the railway, enter upon any lands, being not
more than two hundred yards distant from the centre of
the railway (if no other limits be prescribed) and occupy
them so long as may be necessary for the construction or
repair of that portion of the line, or of the accommodation
works connected therewith (c). In exercise of this power,
the company may manufacture and work upon the lands
any materials used in the construction of the railway,
and may erect workshops and sheds, and other buildings
of a temporary character. This provision, however, will
not exempt the company from an action for nuisance, or
any other injury inflicted in the exercise of these powers
to the lands or habitations of any party other than the
party whose lands are taken. Nor can any garden, orchard,
park, plantation, or ornamental ground, within five hun

purposes (d).

A railway company is also empowered (a) to enter upon
lands adjoining to the railway without the consent of the
owners or occupiers, for the purpose of preventing or repair
ing any slips or accidents in the cuttings, or embankments,
or otherwise, and doing such works as may be necessary
for those purposes. The permission of the Board of Trade
must, however, be first obtained, except in cases of ur
gency, when the company may enter without such per
mission; but in those cases a report must be made to the
Board, within forty-eight hours, of the mature and extent
of the accident, or apprehended accident, and the works
necessary to be done. If, after consideration of the re
port, the Board consider the works unnecessary, then, on
certifying the same to the company, their powers shall
CealSe.
Any works which may thus become necessary, to ensure
the public safety, are to be done with as much dispatch,
and as little injury to the owners and occupiers of the
lands, as is practicable; and for all unavoidable mischief,
inconvenience, and annoyance occasioned to the owners
and occupiers of the lands by the execution of the works,
the company must make full and ample compensation.
If the amount of such compensation be disputed, the
matter is to be settled in the same manner as is provided
in cases of disputed compensation, by the Acts relating to
the railway on which the works may become necessary (b).
So a railway company have power, at any time within
the period limited for the completion of the railway, to
enter upon and use any existing private road, not being
an avenue or a planted or ornamental road, or an approach
to any mansion-house, and not being more than five
hundred yards distant from the centre of the railway, as
delineated on the plans (c).
Three weeks’ notice of their intention to use the
road must be given by the company to the owners and

notice must state the time during which, and the purposes
for which, they intend to occupy such road.
Compensation for the use of the road is to be made to
the owners and occupiers of it, and of the lands over which
it passes, either in a gross sum of money, or by half-yearly
instalments, as may be agreed between the parties. If
they cannot agree, the amount must be determined by two
justices, in the same manner as in cases of disputed com
pensation under £50 for lands to be purchased by the
company (a).
If the owners and occupiers of the road and the lands
over which it passes, object to the company using it, they
may give notice thereof in writing to the promoters, within
ten days from the time of their receiving the above notice, as
before-mentioned, stating that other roads which the com
pany are authorized to use, or that some public road, is
more suited to the purposes of the company. When this
notice of objection has been duly served upon the pro
moters, such proceedings may be taken before two justices
to determine the dispute, as are prescribed in respect of
lands to be taken for temporary purposes (b).
SEC. II.—Right to make permanent alterations in Property

IN addition to the right of using, for temporary purposes,

Chi AP. 11.] l'olt MATION OF THE LINE. 27]
enter upon and make permanent alterations in the property
of others.
Thus they may enter upon any lands within the limits
prescribed by the Special Act; or, if no limits be pre
scribed, not being more than two hundred yards from the
centre of the railway as delineated in the plans, and not
being a garden, orchard, or plantation attached to a house,
nor a park, planted walk, avenue, or ground ornamentally
planted, and not being nearer to the mansion-house of the
owner of the lands than the prescribed distance, or, if no
distance be prescribed, then not nearer than five hundred
yards therefrom, and may remain in the occupation of the
said lands, so long as may be necessary for the construc
tion or repair of that portion of the railway, or of the
accommodation works connected therewith ; and of the
lands so entered upon, the company may make use for the
following purposes:
For the purpose of taking earth or soil by side cuttings
therefrom; of depositing spoil thereon; of obtaining mate
rials therefrom for the construction or repair of the rail
way, or such accommodation works as aforesaid; or for the
purpose of forming roads thereon to, or from, or by the
side of the railway.
It is not, perhaps, quite clear from the wording of the
above section that the company have power, by compulsory
process, to take land for the purpose of getting material
to form an embankment on another part of the line.(a)
That section gives them power to occupy the said lands
“so long as may be necessary for the construction or repair
of that portion of the railway.” These words would seem
to restrict their powers exclusively to the portion of the
line adjoining the lands in question, but in a subsequent
part of the same section their power to use material thus
obtained seems not to be so restricted, but to extend to
the line generally.

As to what may be considered “temporary occupation,”
see Innocent v. North Midland Railway Company (a).
In the exercise of these powers, the company may de
posit and manufacture upon the lands all kinds of mate
rials used for constructing the railway, and may dig any
sand, clay, gravel, or stone, or other thing which may be
found therein useful or proper for the purposes of the
company; they may also erect on the lands workshops,
sheds, and other temporary buildings.
No stone or slate quarry, brick-field, or other like place,
which shall be commonly worked or used for getting ma
terials therefrom for sale, can, however, be taken possession
of by the company, or used as above mentioned.
The company will also be liable to an action for any
nuisance or other injury which may be inflicted on the
lands, or the habitation of any party other than the owner
of the lands so entered upon, if any such injury shall be
occasioned by the exercise of their powers.
Where the company enter upon adjoining lands for the
purpose of making spoil banks, or for side cuttings, or for
obtaining materials, they must give three weeks’ notice of
their intention to the owner and occupier, and must specify
the purposes for which the lands are required. If the
lands be wanted for any other purposes than these, ten
days notice must be given.
In the notices so sent, the company must state the sub
stance of the provisions contained in the Special Act, and
those incorporated with it, respecting the right of the
owner or occupiers to require the company to purchase
any such lands, or to give compensation for the temporary
occupation thereof, as the case may be. These notices are
to be served personally on the owners and occupiers, or
by being left at their last usual place of abode. If
the owners cannot be found, or are out of the kingdom,
then notices must also be left with the occupiers, or, if
(a) l Rail. Ca. 242.
cHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 273
there be no occupiers, must be affixed on some conspicuous
part of the lands (a).
With respect to the importance of specifying in the
notices the purposes for which the lands are required, that
it may be clearly ascertained whether the proposed mode
of dealing with the property is authorised by their Act,
and whether the company are acting bond fide, the follow
ing case, though decided on a clause containing provisions
somewhat different from the above, may serve as a guide.
The company having made their railway in a cutting
through part of the plaintiff's field, which they had pur
chased and paid for, gave a notice of their intention to take
the remaining part of it; and their solicitor, in reply to
the plaintiff’s inquiries, stated that the land was wanted
immediately for the purpose of providing the company with
earth for making the embankment, and that its further
appropriation was not settled. The embankment here
mentioned was at some distance from the field in question,
and the company's Act did not empower them to take the
soil thereof for the purpose of forming it. An injunction
was therefore obtained to restrain the company from
taking any further steps for summoning a jury to assess
the value of the property, and from taking possession of it.
In moving to dissolve this injunction, the company as
signed as an additional reason for taking the land, that
subsequently to the notice having been served on the
owners, but before the statement of the solicitor above
mentioned was made, it was found to be necessary to
widen the slope on each side of the cutting through the
field in question, and to remove the soil from the surface
of the land to prevent the occurrence of accidental slips
which were apprehended.
The Lord Chancellor said, “I must be satisfied that the
company want the land in question for a bond fide purpose
authorised by their Act, and that it is not a mere colour to
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, ss. 33, 34.

cover another object. It must be considered whether sub
sequent events have given the company a title which they
had not in the beginning; at the same time, whatever
might be the object in giving the notice, if it appear that
there now is a right, I do not think that would be a ground
upon which this Court would interfere to prevent them
exercising that right. I certainly cannot sanction their
judging this piece of land to be necessary for the purpose
of the slope, in order to enable them to take it for a pur
pose totally and entirely distinct; at the same time, I
cannot so deal with the matter as to compel them to carry
on these works under the direction of the Court, or take
upon myself to decide on an engineering question, as to
whether a particular piece of land is or is not necessary
I will look at the affidavits for the purpose of satisfying
myself how far the parties are attempting to take this land
for a bond fide purpose provided for by the Act” (a).
In any case where a notice of three weeks is required to
be given to the owners and occupiers of lands, they may,
within ten days of the service of such notice, object (by
notice in writing) to the company making use of those
lands, either on the ground that the lands proposed to be
taken, or the materials, are essential to be retained, to
ensure the beneficial enjoyment of other neighbouring
lands belonging to them; or on the ground that other
lands lying contiguous would be more suitable for the
company’s purpose (b).
Where an owner objects on the ground that it is essen
tial to the beneficial enjoyment of his own property to
retain the lands, he may summon the company before two
justices. This summons must be returnable before the
expiration of the three weeks' notice. If, on hearing
the case, the justices shall be of opinion that the objection
is well founded, they may order that such lands or mate
rials, or some part thereof, shall not be taken by the com
(a) Webb and others v. Manch. and Leeds Rail. Com. 1 Rail. Ca. 576; 4
My. & Cr. 116. (b) 8 Vic. c. 20. s. 35.
cHAP. II.] FORMAT1ON OF THE LINE.
pany; and, on the service of that order upon the company,
they shall be precluded from taking possession of or using
the lands without the consent of the owner (a).
If the owner object that other lands, lying contiguous
to those proposed to be taken, would be more suitable for
the company’s purpose, and the company nevertheless
refuse to occupy them in lieu of those mentioned in the
notice, on the application of the owner, any justice may
summon the company and the owners and occupiers of
such other lands before two justices, at a time and place
to be named; the time not being more than fourteen days
after the application, nor less than seven after the service
of the summons. On the appearance of the parties, the
justices may order summarily what lands shall be taken
by the company, and they shall thereupon be authorised
to take and use the same (b).
It may be useful to observe here, that in all cases where
proceedings before justices are directed, if the parties, or
any of them, fail to appear at the time and place ap
pointed, the case may be heard and adjudicated upon as if
they were all present, if the due service of the summons
upon the absent parties be satisfactorily proved.
If, on the inquiry before the justices, it should appear
that the lands of some third party not before them would
be more suitable for the purposes of the company than
those of the party summoned, they may adjourn the
inquiry, and summon such person to appear before them
at any time, being not more than fourteen days after such
inquiry, nor less than seven after the service of the sum
mons; and, on his appearance, may proceed to determine
the question as to what lands shall be taken (c).
Where the company have secured the sanction of the
justices to enter upon any lands, they may, before taking
possession of them, be required by the owner to find two
sufficient sureties, (to be approved by the justices, if the

Before using the lands for the purposes above men
tioned the company, if so required, must properly fence
them off from other and adjoining lands; placing in the
fence all such gates as the owners may consider necessary
for the convenient occupation of the lands. So to all
private roads used by them they are to put fences and
gates, in every case where they may be necessary to pre
vent cattle from straying. Where differences arise in
respect of such fences and gates, two justices are empowered
to decide the point (b).
Where lands are taken for getting materials, they are
to be worked by the company in such manner as the sur
veyor or agent of the owner shall direct, or as, in case of
dispute, any justice applied to may think right to deter
mine (c).
When a company, in the exercise of the powers given
by their Act, have entered upon any lands for the purpose
of making spoil banks or side cuttings thereon, or for
obtaining materials therefrom, they may, at any time
while they continue in possession, and before the owners
have accepted compensation at their hands, be required,
by notice in writing, to purchase the said lands, or such
interest in them as the parties giving notice to the com
pany may be respectively capable of selling and con
veying (d).
The notice must contain the particulars of the estate
and interest which the owners and occupiers respectively
have in the lands, and the amount of the claim in respect
thereof, and upon the receipt of the notice, the company
will be bound to purchase (e).

required to purchase, and in every other case where they
shall take temporary possession of any lands, under the
powers of their Act, they must, within one month after
taking possession, upon being required so to do, pay to
the occupiers thereof the value of any crop or dressing
that may be thereon, as well as compensation for any other
temporary injury which they may sustain by reason of the
entry of the company.
Moreover, during the period of the companies occupa
tion, they must pay half-yearly to the occupier a rent for
the use of the lands, to be fixed by two justices in case of
difference; and within six months after they shall have
ceased to occupy the said lands, and not later than six
months after the expiration of the time limited for the
completion of the railway, pay to the owner or occupier,
or deposit in the bank for the benefit of the parties inte
rested, compensation for all permanent or other loss, da
mage, or injury, that may have been sustained by them by
reason of the exercise of the company's powers; including
the full value of all clay, stone, gravel, sand, and other
things taken from such lands (a).
The amount and application of the purchase-money
and compensation is to be determined in the same
manner as is provided in the Lands’ Clauses Consolida
tion Act, for determining the amount and application of
the compensation to be paid for lands taken under the
provisions thereof (b).
In the exercise of their large powers the company are
to do as little damage as possible, and to make ample
compensation to the parties who may be injured by the
execution of the works. The following cases are instances
of the liability of companies for mischief consequent on
their proceedings.

for a river, the same to be of equal depth and breadth at
the bottom, and of equal inclination at the sides with the
old course or channel. They were also required to make
compensation to persons interested in any houses and
lands injured by the means of the execution of the powers
thereby granted. The company for the purposes of their
works, purchased the entirety of certain closes, parts of
which, after the undertaking was completed, they sold in
lots. One of the conditions of sale was, that a strip of
land lying between the lots and the new channel of the
river, should be for ever left open as a public road. This
road was afterwards adopted and repaired by the parish,
but a portion of it having given way, in consequence of
the action of the tide causing a slip in the bank, (whereby
the inclination of the sides of the new channel became
altered,) the owners and occupiers of houses built upon
the said lots since the sale, called upon the company to
repair the bank, which they refused to do. On an appli
cation by the Corporation of Bristol, who are conservators
of the river, on affidavits stating these facts, and also
stating apprehensions of injury to the navigation, though
not showing any actual impediment caused thereto, the
Court granted a mandamus to compel the company to
repair and maintain the bank (a).
Under a Railway Act which gave power to divert rivers,
watercourses, &c., a company had raised the level of a
brook, into which the sough of a coal mine had been
accustomed to empty itself, and thereby caused the waters
of the brook to flow into the sough, and inundate and
stop the coal-works; upon the owner of them applying
for a mandamus to the company, requiring them to
summon a jury to ascertain and compensate him for
the injury done to his works by such diverting of
the brook; which was opposed by the company on the
ground that on the claimant's remonstrance they had
(a) Reg. v. Bristol Dock Com. 1 Rail. Ca. 548; 1 G. & D. 287.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE LIN E. 279
restored the brook to its former level, and that no damage
had been done by the alteration, such stoppage having
been frequently caused by the floods before; it was held,
that it was a question for a jury whether any damage had
been done to the claimant; and that his alleging that he
was injured by the diverting (i. e. altering the level) of
the brook, was sufficient to induce the Court to grant a
mandamus (a).
A railway company in constructing their railway, may
raise, sink, or otherwise alter the position of any of the
watercourses, water-pipes, or gas-pipes, belonging to any
of the houses adjoining or near to the railway; and also
the mains and other pipes laid down by any company for
the supply of water or gas; doing as little detriment
as possible, and causing as little inconvenience to the
company, or the inhabitants, as the circumstances will
admit.
These alterations must be effected under the super
intendence of the company to which the pipes belong;
and of the several commissioners, or trustees, or persons
having the control of the pavements, sewers, roads,
streets, highways, lanes, and other public passages and
places within the district in which the alterations are
made, or of their surveyor, if either he, or they, think
fit to attend after receiving forty-eight hours notice to
that effect (b).
Where a public company has a right to interfere with
pipes laid down under the pavement of a street, the
workmen they employ are bound to use such care and
caution in doing the works as will protect the King's
subjects (themselves using reasonable care,) from injury,
and if they so lay the stones as to give such an appear
ance of security as would induce a moderately careful
person to tread upon them as safe, when in fact, they

In all these cases the contractors employed in the
execution of the works will be deemed the agents of the
company, and the latter will be liable to an action for
any wrongful act or omission of which they may be
guilty (b).
But the company may not proceed to make any of
these alterations so as to impede the passage of water or
gas through the mains or pipes; and, therefore, before
they interfere with the existing apparatus, they must pro
vide good and sufficient mains or pipes, syphons, plugs,
and all other necessary works, and lay them down ready
for use, in a position as little varying from the position
of those to be displaced as may be consistent with the
construction of the railway, and to the satisfaction of
the surveyor or engineer of the company whose works
are so altered or removed. If the company cannot
agree with this officer, the dispute is to be settled by
a justice. (c).
The company may not lay down these gas or water-pipes
contrary to the regulations of any Act of Parliament re
lating to the gas or water company; nor lower any road,
so as to leave less than eighteen inches depth of covering
over the pipes from the surface of the road (d).
Where the railway passes over any mains and pipes, the
company must construct and maintain a good and sufficient
culvert, so as to leave them accessible for repairs (e).
If, in executing their works, a railway company interrupt
the supply of any water or gas, they will be liable to a
penalty of £20 a day so long as the interruption continues,
and the same may be recovered by summary proceeding
before two justices. The penalty is to be appropriated to

SEC. III.—Right to vary and restrict the rights of others

IN addition to the rights conferred on a railway company

which they do not purchase, they are also empowered, in
certain cases, to limit and modify the exercise of the rights
of ownership on the part of others.
The most signal instance of this is their power to Mines.

A railway company will not be entitled to any mines of Company not

it is expressly named and has been purchased; except such
portions of it as it may be necessary to dig and carry away,

(c) The distance thus prescribed as that within which minerals are not to
be worked, may be intended to include all such as lie within the limits of a
line taken perpendicularly at a distance of forty yards laterally from the centre
of the railway; or such as would be comprehended within a circle of a radius
of forty yards, the centre being on the surface of the rail. If the former mode
of measuring be adopted, the owner of the mine would be precluded from
working it at any depth below, or any height above, the surface of the railway
nearer thereto laterally than the prescribed distance; but if the latter be the
correct mode of measuring, it may frequently happen that minerals may be
worked both below and (in the case of a tunnel) above the line, so long as the
works do not come within the forty yards. *

work them, he must, before commencing his operations,
give thirty days’ notice in writing to the company of his
intention to do so. On receipt of such notice, the company
may cause the mines to be inspected by a person appointed
by them for that purpose; and if it appear that the working
thereof will be dangerous, or likely to damage the works of
the railway, and the company be willing to give compen
sation, the owner, lessee, or occupier, will be precluded from
working them. Any dispute between the parties as to the
amount of compensation is to be settled as in other like
cases, by arbitration, or by a jury (a). If the company
do not express their willingness to give compensation be
fore the expiration of thirty days, the party entitled may
proceed to work the mines in a workmanlike and proper
manner (b).
If any damage or obstruction be occasioned to the rail
way company by any improper working of the mines, the
parties must repair or remove it, as the case may require,
at their own expense; and if this repair or removal be not
forthwith done, the company may (even without waiting
for the other parties to do the works) execute the same,
and recover the cost of it from the parties who have occa
sioned the mischief (c).
But where a railway company, after notice, make no
offer to purchase a mine, and the owner proceeds accord
ingly to work it himself, he will be entitled to do so in the
usual manner; and no damage caused to the railway by
such customary mode of working the mine can be recovered
from the owner thereof. The question in such cases will
be—Whether the mine has been worked in an improper
manner? Thus, where a Canal Act provided that the
canal company should not be entitled to retain coal mines,
but required the owners to give notice to the company of
their intention to work them within ten yards of the canal,
and empowered the company to inspect the mines and to
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 78. (b) Idem, s. 79.
(c) Ibid.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 283
stop the further working of them, paying compensation to
the owners, and the works proceeding injury was done to
the canal, it was held that the right of the owners to work
within ten yards was left as before the Act, if, after notice
given by them to the company, the latter did not purchase
out their rights; and that, the canal being damaged by the
nearer approach of the mine after such notice and non
purchase, no action lay against the coal-owner for such
injury, which happened by the default of the company in
not purchasing (a).
Where mines extend on both sides of the railway, and
the working of them is prevented to some extent by reason
of apprehended injury to the railway, the owners, lessees,
and occupiers, may make airways, headways, gateways, or
water levels, through the mines, measures, or strata, the
working of which is prevented, for the purpose of ventilat
ing, draining, and working the mines. If no dimensions
or sections be prescribed by the Act, these various works
shall not be greater than eight feet wide, and eight feet
high, nor shall they be cut or made upon any part of the
railway or works, or so as to injure the same or impede the
passage thereon (b).
The company must, from time to time, reimburse the
proprietors of the mines extending on both sides of the
railway such additional expense as shall be incurred, and
compensate them for such losses as may have been caused,
by reason of the severance of the lands by the railway, and
make compensation also for the interruption of the con
tinuous working of the mines, and for the restrictions im
posed upon them in respect of such operations for the
safety of the railway works. Any dispute as to the amount
of this compensation is to be settled by arbitration (c).

as to mines.
Compensation

When to be
claimed.
We may gather from the above provisions, that if, after
notice given, a railway company makes no offer to purchase
the mines, the owners may work them on certain con
ditions essential for securing the stability of the railroad.
These conditions being necessarily injurious to the parties
entitled to the minerals, all losses and expenses occasioned
thereby are to be reimbursed by the company for whose
benefit they are imposed. Therefore, the cost of making
airways and other works of that description, rendered
necessary by the severance of the lands by the railway, or
by restrictions on the mode of working the mines, are to
be borne by the company; and the value of all minerals
which the proprietors of the mines are precluded from
getting lest the railroad should be endangered, must be
allowed to them. The following cases have been decided
on clauses containing provisions similar to those we have
been considering.
With regard to the amount of compensation to which
the owner of minerals is entitled, and the time when he
must make his claim, the following case, turning on pro
visions very similar to the above, has been decided.
Minerals having been sold by the proprietor to a railway
company, the lessee was held entitled to compensation for
his interest in them, the amount of such compensation to
be computed by estimating the profit to be derived from
the mineral when gotten, after deducting the expense of
getting it. (a)
This compensation must, however, be claimed and
assessed at the proper time, or it cannot be recovered.
By a Local Act, a company was empowered to take lands,
with an exception of mines, for a railway; paying the value
of the lands, and making compensation for damages sus
tained by reason of the execution of the works, and for
damages, loss, or inconvenience sustained by reason of the
execution of any of the powers of the Act; such value and
(a) Barnsley Canal Nav. Com. v. Twibill, 3 Rail. Ca. 471.
CHAP. II.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 285
compensation to be fixed by agreement, or assessed by a
jury: mines were to be worked by the owner, so that no
damage should be thereby done to the railway; and in
case of damage, the owner was to repair it at his own ex
pense; or the company, in case of his neglect or refusal,
might repair it, and recover the expenses from the owner.
The owner of land taken by the company, and for which
compensation has been paid, cannot, upon afterwards dis
covering that a mine to which he is entitled cannot be
worked without doing damage to the railway, claim fur
ther compensation in respect of the loss sustained thereby.
Compensation in respect of such contingent loss should
have been claimed at the time of the original agreement
or assessment. (a)
Besides compensating the owners and occupiers of the
mines for injury and loss which they may sustain by reason
of the making of the railway, the company must also make
compensation to the parties owning or occupying the lands
over the mines, the works of which shall have been inter
rupted or prevented, for any loss or damage sustained by
them by reason of any airway or other works which would
not have been necessary had not the working of the mines
been restricted by the conditions imposed by the com
pany. (b)
To avoid danger to the stability of the line, the com
pany may at any time, after giving twenty-four hours no
tice in writing, inspect the mines which are being worked
in the neighbourhood of the railway, and for that purpose
make use of the apparatus or machinery belonging thereto,
and adopt any means which they may deem necessary fur
ascertaining the distance of the railroad from the part of
the mine being (or about to be) worked. (c) For every

CHAPTER III.
EXECUTION OF THE WORKS.
BEFoRE commencing the execution of the works, corrected
plans and books of reference must be duly deposited with
the proper parties. If any omission or mis-statement has
been made in the books of reference, plans, or schedule
of the Act, as to the owners, lessees, or occupiers of any
lands, the company, on giving ten days’ notice to the parties
whose interests may be affected, may apply to two justices
for the correction thereof, who shall, if it so appear, give
a certificate that the omission or mis-statement arose from
mistake, and specify the particulars ofsuch error or omission.
The certificate so obtained is to be deposited with the
clerks of the peace in the several counties where the lands
affected by the alteration shall be situate, and with the
parish clerks of the several parishes in England, and with
the postmasters of the post towns in, or nearest to, such
parishes in Ireland in which the lands lie. This certificate
is to be left with the other documents relating to the
matter, and the plan, book of reference, or schedule, are to
be deemed to be corrected accordingly. (a)
With respect to the alterations made by parliament in
the original plans and sections of the railway, it is the duty
of the company to deposit (as above) correct plans and
sections of such alterations, on the same scale, and contain
ing the same particulars, and subject to the same right of
inspection and copying, as the original plan and section of
the railway. (b) True copies of the plans and books of

By the 25th section of the Railway Clauses Consoli

Act of Parliament to construct a railway in Ireland, must,
before they commence the execution of the works, submit
their plans to the commissioners appointed under the sta
tute 5 & 6 Wic. cap 89, to superintend the execution
thereof, in regard to the drainage of lands in Ireland. The
commissioners are to examine and report on the nature
and extent of the works necessary for drainage, and, on
their approval of the company's plans, are to grant a cer
tificate to that effect, without which it will not be lawful
for the company to commence their proceedings. (a)
SEC. I.-General Powers and Restrictions in the Execution
of the Works.
THE general powers conferred on a railway company in
the execution of their works, are enumerated in the follow
ing section of the 8 Vic. cap. 20, which provides that, sub
ject to the provisions and restrictions in that Act, and the
Special Act, and any Act incorporated therewith, it shall
be lawful for the company, for the purpose of constructing
the railway, or the accommodation works connected there
with, to execute any of the following works, that is to
say:
They may make or construct in, upon, across, under, or
over any lands, any street, hills, valleys, roads, railroads, or
tramroads, rivers, canals, brooks, streams, or other waters
within the lands described in the said plans, or mentioned
(a) See post, p. 323.
CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 289
in the said books of reference, or any correction thereof,
such temporary or permament inclined planes, tunnels,
embankments, aqueducts, bridges, roads, ways, passages,
conduits, drains, piers, arches, cuttings, and fences, as they
think proper.
They may alter the course of any rivers not navigable,
brooks, streams, or watercourses; and of any branches of
navigable rivers, such branches not being themselves navi
gable, within such lands, for the purpose of constructing,
and maintaining tunnels, bridges, passages, or other works,
over or under the same, and divert or alter, as well tem
porarily as permanently, the course of any such rivers, or
streams of water, roads, streets, or ways, or raise or sink
the level of any such rivers or streams, roads, streets, or
ways, in order the more conveniently to carry the same
over, or under, or by the side of the railway, as they may
think proper.
They may make drains or conduits into, through, or
under any lands adjoining the railway, for the purpose of
conveying water from or to the railway.
They may make, erect, and construct such houses, ware
houses, offices, and other buildings, yards, stations, wharfs,
engines, machinery, apparatus, and other works and con
veniences, as they may think proper.
They may from time to time alter, repair, or discon
tinue the before-mentioned works, or any of them, and
substitute others, in their stead.
And they may do all other acts necessary for making,
maintaining, altering or repairing, and using the railway.
Provided always that in the exercise of the powers by
this or the Special Act granted, the company shall do as
little damage as can be, and shall make full satisfaction in
manner herein and in the Special Act, and any Act incor
porated therewith, provided, to all parties interested, for
all damages by them sustained, by reason of the exercise
of such powers (a).

The above are the general powers conferred on railway
companies in executing their works; and in the latter
part of the above section provision seems to be made for
damage done to any parties by the construction of the
works, and for which compensation may not have been
given under the Lands Clauses’ Act. The amount of any
such compensation must be determined in the manner
prescribed thereby.
In addition to these powers, the company may, in cer
tain cases of hardship, be relieved from the necessity of
constructing their works in exact conformity with the re
quirements of the General and Special Acts. Thus,
where a strict compliance with the provisions of a Railway
Act would be impossible, or attended with inconvenience
to the company, without adequate advantage to the pub
lic, an appeal may be made to the Commissioners of
Railways, should any difference arise as to the construc
tion, alteration, or restoration of any road, or bridge, or
other public work of an engineering nature, between the
company and the trustees or commissioners having the
control of, or being authorized by law to enforce the con
struction of such road, bridge, or work.
Either party, on giving fourteen days' notice to the
other of his intention, may make this appeal; and after
hearing the parties, the commissioners may certify the
mode in which such work shall be done: and being ex
ecuted in conformity with the certificate, it will be deemed
to be executed in conformity with the Act. This certifi
cate will not be granted in any case in which existing
private rights and interests might be injuriously affected
thereby (a).
Certificates of the Commissioners of Railways are to be
authenticated as issued by that body, if they purport to
to be signed by some officer appointed by them for that
purpose, without proof of his authority or of his signature,
which are to be presumed until the contrary is proved.

Any such certificate left at one of the principal offices
of a railway company, or sent to to the secretary by the
post, will be deemed to be served upon the company (a).
The company in the execution of their works must not
act capriciously, but are bound so to execute them, as to in
flict as little damage as possible; and if by any reckless
mode of carrying out their plans, injury is done which
ought to have been avoided, a Court of Equity will inter
fere, and restrain them by injunction (b).
And although a railway company acting bond fide are
deemed to be the most competent judges of the best
mode of forming the line (c), still the legislature will not
permit them to do damage to the property of any person,
if, by adopting a different mode of construction, it may be
avoided; as nothing but absolute necessity can autho
rise a company to inflict injury on an individual; and
any heedless or wanton exercise of their powers, regard
less of the rights and convenience of others, is an excess
of the authority conferred on them, which is limited, in
the provision which regulates the execution of the works,
by the words “doing as little damage as may be.” (d.)
In addition to the general restrictions in the forma
tion of the line above alluded to, there are others more
specific, which deserve notice. Such are those imposed by
private agreement with the company, or by the provisions
of the General and Special Acts in respect of particular
classes of property.
Thus, if any agreement has been made by the company
with landowners or others before the passing of the Special
Act, in relation to the manner in which the works shall

be executed at any particular part of the line, and such
agreement is not in contravention of the provisions of the
general Railway Acts, the company will be bound to ex
ecute the works in conformity with the terms of their
agreement; and a Court of Equity would restrain them
by injunction from proceeding in violation of the condi
tions of their own contract, or enforce specific perform
ance thereof, even though it were not embodied in the
Special Act. Agreements with respect to these matters
are most frequently entered into by the company with the
owners of public works, such as the proprietors of naviga
tions, Drainage Commissioners, and trustees of turnpike
roads; but sometimes also with landowners who impose
restrictions as to the mode of constructing the works where
the line passes through their property, as the condition of
their assent to the undertaking (a).
So where the railway interferes with public or govern
ment property, provision is made for securing government
control over the company in the execution of the works.
Thus works between high and low water marks must be car
ried on subject to the approval and inspection of the Lords
of the Admiralty and Commissioners of her Majesty’s
Woods and Forests. (b) Nor can any works be constructed
on the shore of the sea, or of any creek, bay, or arm of the
sea, or navigable river communicating therewith, where
the tide flows and reflows, without the consent in writing
of the Lords of the Admiralty, as well as of the Commis
sioners of Woods and Forests. The works must also be
constructed according to plans provided, and under such
restrictions as may be imposed, by the Lords of the Admi
ralty and the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.

such consent, or in contravention of their instructions, the

Lords of the Admiralty may abate and remove all such
constructions, and restore the site to its former condition,
at the cost of the company: such costs are to be ascer
tained by two justices, and are recoverable in the same
manner as other penalties imposed by the Act(a); namely,
by distress on the goods of the company, if not paid within
seven days after demand (b).
SEC. II.—Deviations from the proposed Line.
WHEN the plans prepared by a company have been
sanctioned by Act of Parliament, the latter will not be
permitted, in constructing the line, to deviate from those
plans, except within certain limits, and subject to certain
conditions and restrictions.
The deviations allowed to be made may be either devia
tions from the level of the railway, as referred to the
datum line marked on the sections, and the consequent
variation of the gradients; or deviations laterally from the
line of the railroad as shown on the plans, including the
alteration of the radius and direction of curves; or, lastly,
they may be alterations in respect of tunnels and viaducts,
or the substitution therefor of cuttings and embank
ments.
A company may not deviate, in any part of the line,
from the levels of the railway, as referred to the common
datum line described in the section, to a greater extent
than five feet; nor to a greater extent than two feet in
passing through a town, village, street, or land conti
nuously built upon, without the previous consent, in
writing, of the owners and occupiers of the lands in which
the deviation is proposed to be made. Where a street or

public highway is to be affected by such deviation, the
consent of the trustees or commissioners having the
control thereof must be obtained; or, if there be no trus
tees or commissioners, then the consent of two or more
justices of the peace, in petty sessions assembled for that
purpose, and acting for the district in which the street or
highway in question is situate.
Fourteen days’ notice of the holding of a petty sessions
for this purpose must be given in some newspaper circu
lating in the county, and must also be affixed on the door
of the parish church, or other place on which notices are
usually affixed.
So where the proposed deviation will affect any public
sewers, canal, navigation, gas works, or water works, the
consent of the commissioners or proprietors thereof, as
the case may be, must be previously obtained.
There are some deviations from the level sanctioned by
Parliament which will, however, be permitted without the
consent of any parties. Thus the company may lower to
any extent any solid embankment, or viaduct, provided
they leave the proper height of headway below as pre
scribed by their Act, wherever roads, streets, or canals,
pass under the railway. (a)
If the company wish to make any greater deviation
from the level of the line than the five feet or two feet,
they must, after having obtained the consent of the owners
and occupiers above mentioned, give three weeks’ public
notice thereof, once, at least, in two newspapers, or twice
in one newspaper, circulating in the district or neighbour
hood in which the deviation is proposed to be made.
The owners of the lands prejudicially affected by the
proposed deviation are at liberty, at any time before the
deviation is commenced, after giving ten days notice
thereof to the company, to apply to the Commissioners of
Railways to decide whether, having regard to the interests
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 11.
Ch.A.P. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 295
of the applicants, it is proper that the proposed deviation
should be made. The Commissioners of Railways may,
if they think fit, entertain and decide the question, and
give a certificate in writing either to authorise or dis
allow the proposed works, and they may sanction their
execution, either simply or with such modifications and
conditions as to them may appear right. But when
such a certificate is once granted, the company can
only make the proposed deviation in conformity there
with (a).
Subject to the provisions in regard to altering levels,
the company may improve the inclination or gradients of
the railway to any extent, and may increase them as fol
lows (that is to say): in gradients of an inclination not
exceeding one in a hundred, to any extent not exceeding
ten feet per mile, or to such further extent as the Com
missioners of Railways may certify to be consistent with
the public safety, and not prejudicial to the public inte
rest; and in gradients of or exceeding the inclination of
one in a hundred, to any extent not exceeding three
feet per mile, or to any further extent which shall be
so certified as aforesaid by the Commissioners of Rail
ways (b).
It would appear from the above provision, that a railway
company may, if they think fit, and without the consent
of any persons, make deviations from the level of the line
to the extent in any place of not more than five feet;
and in streets and places continuously built upon, of not
more than two feet. So they may lower solid embank
ments and viaducts more than five feet, or two feet, with
out any consent, if the proper headway be left below.
But if they propose to deviate from the original level
more than five feet, or two feet (as the case may be),
then, in addition to the sanction of the owners, or of the
justices in petty sessions, or of the commissioners or

trustees whose consent may be required, the company
must also advertise their intention to deviate as above
mentioned. If application is made to the Commissioners
of Railways, and the board decide that the deviations may
be made, under certain conditions, and with certain modi
fications, the company must either relinquish the proposed
alterations, or carry them out as the certificate directs.
If the commissioners refuse to entertain or decide the ap
plication, and the company persist in executing the works
with the proposed deviations, a mandamus might be ob
tained by the owners of the lands, commanding them to
execute the works according to the original plans. So, if
the certificate of the commissioners were disobeyed, a
mandamus would be the only mode of compelling obedi
ence, as the commissioners would seem to have no autho
rity to enforce their own order.
The company may deviate from the line delineated on
the plans, provided that no such deviation shall extend to a
greater distance than the limits of deviation therein de
scribed. Where a railway passes through a town, village,
or lands continuously built upon, the deviation must not
exceed ten yards, and elsewhere it must not exceed one
hundred yards. In those deviations, however, the line
must not be made to extend into the lands of any person,
whether owner, lessee, or occupier, whose name is not
mentioned in the Books of Reference, without the prior
consent in writing of such person, unless the name shall
have been omitted by mistake. (a)
In these cases of unintentional error which the company
are anxious to correct, they must give ten days notice to
the parties to be affected by the correction, and may then
apply to two justices, who, if satisfied that the omission
was accidental, may certify the same, stating the parti
culars of the omission. On the deposit of this certificate
with the clerks of the peace, or other officers appointed to
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 15.
CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 297
receive the same, the Book of Reference is to be deemed
corrected. (a)
Although the Standing Orders of the two Houses of
Parliament provide that all lands included within the limits
of deviation shall be described on the plans, and scheduled,
and proper notices be served upon the owners and occu
piers, yet they do not prescribe any distance beyond which
those limits may not extend. The effect of the enactment
above cited, however, is to confine the lateral deviations of
the line to ten yards, or one hundred yards (as the case
may be), provided such deviations are not made without
consent into the lands of persons not named in the Book
of Reference. Should any alteration have been made in
the plans by Parliament, and the limits of deviation were
not made sufficiently large, the company may be precluded
from availing themselves of the power conferred as above,
in consequence of the omission from the plans and books
of reference of the lands into which it might be desirable
to deviate. Hence it may be worthy of consideration in
certain cases, whether more than one hundred yards should
not be taken on the plans as the limit of deviation.
The company are empowered to diminish the radius of
any curve described in the plan to any extent which shall
leave a radius of not less than half a mile, or to any fur
ther extent authorised by a certificate as above mentioned
from the Commissioners of Railways. This power will be
limited in its exercise by the provisions made in respect of
lateral deviations.
The time within which the company can elect to de
viate from the line, if there be no period expressly men
tioned in the Special Act for that purpose, would doubtless
be held to continue as long as the company were privi
leged to exercise compulsory powers for the purchase of
land, which by the Lands’ Clauses Consolidation Act is

On this point, see the River Don Navigation Company v.
The North Midland Railway Company (a).
Where the company are allowed to deviate from their
line within certain limits, and under certain conditions,
the same rights and powers will be incidental to the de
viated as to the original line. Therefore, where by a
clause in a Railway Act it was provided that the lands to
be taken for the line of the railway were not to exceed
twenty-two yards in breadth, except in places required
(inter alia) for embankments and cuttings; and by another
clause (which gave powers to deviate in the line and sec
tion), the deviation from the line delineated on the plan
deposited with the clerks of the peace was limited to one
hundred yards: it was held that the company were not
limited to one hundred yards in those places in the devia
tion required for embankments and cuttings, but only in
the actual line of the railway; and that the line or centre,
from which measurements were to be made, was the
medium filum of the twenty-two yards of land to be taken,
and not of the space between the two rails (b).
Those persons only whose interests are injuriously af
fected, or whose rights are invaded, by the deviation from
the line by the company, can obtain the interference of
a Court of Equity. It must appear that the complainant
as an individual suffers by the illegal Act complained of,
and not only that he is affected by it as one of the
public (c).
Where a company exceeds its powers, either by deviating
beyond the limits allowed, or by deviating without their
consent into the lands of persons whose names were
omitted from the Book of Reference (and which omission
had not been supplied by two justices in the manner pre

scribed by the Act), the proper remedy is an action of
trespass (a).
Where the plans of a railway as approved by Parliament
show a tunnel or viaduct at any point on the line, the
company are bound to execute it accordingly, unless the
owners, lessees, and occupiers of the land through or over
which it was intended to be made, shall consent that an
open cutting or embankment shall be substituted in the
place thereof(b). Nevertheless, it will be lawful for the com
pany to make a tunnel, not marked on the plan or section,
instead of a cutting, or a viaduct instead of a solid em
bankment, if authorised by a certificate from the Commis
sioners of Railways (c).
SEC. III.—Crossing, Diverting, &c., Turnpike and
other Roads.
IN addition to the various matters already mentioned as
connected with the formation of the line of railway, many
others are made the subjects of specific enactments in the
general Railway Acts, and in the Special Acts. Of several
of the most important we propose, before dismissing this
part of the subject, shortly to treat; and, first, as to cross
ing, diverting, &c., turnpike and other roads.
It is a general rule that where the line of a railway
crosses the line of a turnpike road, or public highway,
either the railway should be carried over the road, or the
road over the railway, as may be most convenient under
the circumstances, regard being had to the respective
levels; the company not being permitted to cross the
road on a level without the special permission of the Legis
lature, and clauses to that effect inserted in the Special
(a) Reg. v. Bristol and Exeter Rail. Com. 2 Rail. Ca. 99; 11 A. & E. 202.

Act. Wherever the line is carried over or under the high
way, the company are bound to make the bridge of the
height and width, and with the ascent or descent, by
their Act prescribed. They are, moreover, at all times
thereafter to maintain and repair the bridge at their own
expense, and the immediate approaches, and all other ne
cessary works connected therewith.
In cases where railways now cross turnpike and other
roads on a level, and the company are willing to carry
them over or under the railway at their own expense, but
are not empowered to do so by their Acts, the Commis
sioners of Railways may give the requisite authority for
that purpose, if they are satisfied that the safety of the
public will be thereby promoted, and at the same time no
private existing rights or interests be violated, without
adequate compensation. All interested parties must be
heard before the commissioners decide, and they may then
accede to the proposal of the company simply or subject
to such conditions and modifications as to them may ap
pear right (a). -
The company may, with the consent of two or more
justices in petty session, carry the railway across any high
way other than a public carriage road on the level (b).
Fourteen days’ notice of the holding of a petty session, at
which application is intended to be made for this purpose,
must be given in some newspaper circulating in the county,
and also be affixed to the door of the parish church, or
other place where notices are usually affixed (c). Parties
feeling themselves aggrieved by this decision of the justices,
may appeal to the quarter sessions. Such appeal must be
entered within four months next after the making of the
order, and ten days’ notice thereof, stating the nature and
grounds of such appeal, must be given to the opposite
party. The appellant must also enter into recognizances

(c) Idem, s. 59.
CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 301
with two sufficient sureties before a justice conditioned
duly to prosecute such appeal (a).
Where a railway crosses any highway other than a
public carriage road on the level, the company must at
their own expense provide and maintain proper approaches,
guarded with sufficient fences and hand-rails, and supplied
with the necessary gates, if the road be a bridle way, or
gates or stiles if it be a footway (b). -
On failure of the company to make these approaches,
two justices may, on the application of the surveyor of the
road, or of two householders within the parish or district
in which the crossing shall be situate, after ten days’
notice to the company, order them to complete such ap
proaches within a time to be limited in the order. On
the company's default, they may be convicted in a penalty
of £5 for every day they fail so to do. This penalty is to
be applied at the discretion of the justices in the execution
of the required works (c).
When, under the provisions of their Act, a company are
required to maintain or keep in repair any fence, approach,
gate, or other work executed by them, and any such work
shall be out of repair, two justices may order them, after
ten days’ notice, and on the complaint of the surveyor, or
of two householders in the district, to put the same into
repair within a specified time. On their neglect or refusal
to comply with this order, they will be liable to a penalty
of £5 a day, which may be applied in the execution of the
works under the direction of the justices (d).
Where the company are permitted by their Special Act
to cross any turnpike road or public highway on a level,
they must at their own expense erect, and at all times
maintain, good and sufficient gates across such road, on
each side of the railway, where the same shall communi
cate therewith; and employ proper persons to open and
shut them.

The gates are to be kept constantlyshut across the road on
both sides of the railway, except when they are opened for
the passage of cattle or vehicles. The gates are to be of
such dimensions as to form a barrier across either the
highway or railway, and to be so constructed as that, whe
ther they be closed across the one or the other, they shall
fence in and enclose the railway, so that no cattle can
stray on to the line from the road (a).
The legal meaning of the words “turnpike road,” is a
road on which parties have by law a right to erect gates and
bars for the purpose of taking toll, and of refusing the
permission to pass to all persons who refuse to pay (b).
In cases where the Board of Trade are of opinion that
it would be more conducive to the public safety to have
the gates at such crossing made to close across the railway
instead of across the road, they are to be kept so closed,
and opened only to allow the passage of trains and engines
along the line (c).
The person having the charge of any gate is to be liable
to a penalty of 40s, if he neglect to close it as soon as the
vehicles, cattle, train, or engine, shall have passed through.
This penalty may be recovered as in other cases (d).
Before any carriage road, horse road, tram road, or
railway, either public or private, is crossed, cut through,
raised, sunk, or used under the powers of a Railway Act,
so as to render it impassable or dangerous, or extraordi
marily inconvenient to passengers or carriages, or to the
persons entitled to the use thereof; the company shall,
before the commencement of any such operations, cause a
sufficient road to be made instead of the road to be inter
fered with, and shall at their own expense maintain such
substituted road in a state as convenient for passengers

so as may be (a).
If the company fail to make another sufficient road be
fore interfering with the existing road, they will be liable
to a penalty of £20 a day for every day during which such
substituted road shall not be made after the existing road
shall have been interrupted. This penalty may be reco
vered with costs by action in any of the superior courts,
and is to be paid to the trustees or commissioners, surveyor,
or other person having the management of such road, if a

thereof (b).

may recover compensation for such damages together with
his costs in any of the superior courts, whether he shall
have previously sued for the above penalty or not, and
without prejudice to the right of any party to sue for the
same (c).
If a railway company under the powers of their Act
obstruct a highway before providing a good and sufficient
substituted road, in addition to the penalties imposed by
the statute, upon the company, their servants will be liable
to an indictment at common law for such obstruction.
By a Railway Act a company was empowered to divert
and alter the course of any roads or ways, in order the
more conveniently to carry the same over, or under, or by
the side of the said railway. By one of the sections it was
enacted that in all cases wherein in the exercise of such
power, any part of the carriage road, &c., should be found
necessary to be cut through, raised, sunk, taken, or so
much injured as to be impassable, or inconvenient for pas

sengers, or carriages, &c., or to the persons entitled to the
usethereof; the company should at their own expense,
before any such road, &c. should be so cut through, &c.,
cause a good and sufficient carriage road, &c., to be set
out and made instead thereof; as convenient for passen
gers and carriages as the former road, or as near thereto
as might be. The company had diverted a highway and
obstructed the old road by building a wall across it, and
had made a new road, which was neither as convenient to
the public as the old one, nor as near thereto as might be.
It was held that the servants of the company were indicta
ble, in the common form, for obstructing the highway (a).
The Court of Queen’s Bench will also grant a manda
mus compelling a railway company to set out and make
a good and sufficient substituted road, as convenient for
passengers and carriages, and for all purposes as the
former. And where a question arose as to the sufficiency
and conveniency of such substituted road, Lord Denman
told the jury that he considered that every right of way
that was rendered less convenient for passengers under any
circumstances, in the case of a drift way as well as any
other, was a proper subject for inquiry by the jury. “That
although the company may have made the new road better
than before, in some respects in which the old road might
have been made as convenient by proper care and atten
tion, yet, ifby making it narrower, it is in that respect less
convenient to the public, the other advantages of the new
road over the old should not be considered an equivalent.
And it appeared to him to be a matter of necessity, that
contracting a road makes it less convenient, and that the
Act intended to comprise passengers under all circum
stances, with flocks and herds, as well as horses and car
riages (b).
Or an injunction will be granted on the application of

CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE.
a party injured by the conduct of the company in stopping
up or rendering impassable an existing road before another
has been provided equally convenient; although it be a
public nuisance for which an indictment would lie. A
railway company was empowered to cut through public
and private roads, provided that if the same should be
thereby rendered impassable, or inconvenient for the per
sons entitled to the use thereof, the company should pre
viously cause another sufficient road to be made instead
thereof, and equally convenient, or as near thereto as
might be. On the first of June the company, as it was
alleged, had completely cut through a certain public road
without having complied with the provisions of the Act,
by previously causing such a substituted road to be made,
whereby the plaintiffs sustained special damage. On the
twentieth of June the plaintiffs filed their bill, praying an
injunction to restrain the company from continuing to cut
through, or stop up the road, and for other relief; and it
was held by the Vice Chancellor, on a motion for an
injunction, that in the case stated the Court would not
only restrain the further cutting of the road, but enjoin
the company from continuing to stop up the same, and
thereby compel them to restore it to its original state (a).
But when the company have failed to make a substituted
road according to the provisions of their Act, before using
the old one for their own purposes, it would seem that the
trustees of the latter will not be justified in obstructing
the company in their use of it; but their remedy would be
to apply either to a Court of Equity for an injunction
against the company, or to a Court of Law, for a man
damus (b). On such an application being made, the
company cannot be permitted to allege expence or incon
venience, as grounds for not complying with the provisions
of their Act; nor will the fact of their having made a

road, if it be more circuitous and less convenient than
the one which their Act obliges them to substitute
for the original road, be a sufficient compliance therewith.
A Court of Equity will not deprive a party of what he is
entitled to, because it is inconvenient to another party;
and it is the misfortune of the company if they have failed
to obtain those powers which may be necessary for the
convenient execution of their works (a).
A liberal interpretation will be put on remedial clauses
in Railway Acts, in respect of roads to be substituted for
those taken by the company; so as to give a party injured
by the execution of the works, the remedy which he was
intended to have. Thus a bodily injury to a road or wharf
is not necessarily the only injury for which the party may
recover damages. “The Hull and Selby Railway Act.”
provides that in all cases in which in the exercise of any
of the powers thereby granted, any part of any quay or
wharf, either public or private, shall be found necessary
to be cut through, &c., or so much injured as to be im
passable or inconvenient for the transporting, conveying,
landing, shipping, or depositing of any goods or merchan
dise; the company shall at their own expense, before any
such quay or wharf be cut through or injured as aforesaid,
cause another good and sufficient quay or wharf to be set
out and made instead thereof, as convenient for the trans
porting, conveying, landing, shipping, or depositing goods
or merchandise as the quay or wharf so to be cut through,
taken, or injured as aforesaid, or as near thereto as may
be. The railway was made to pass in front of a wharf
belonging to the plaintiff, between it and low water mark,
separating the frontage from the water, thereby causing
inconvenience and risk to the plaintiff in loading and un
loading vessels; and it was held that the plaintiff’s wharf

o
was injured within the meaning of the Act, and that he
was entitled to have a new wharf erected for him by the
company, and was not bound to come in under the ordi
nary compensation clause (a).
It has, however, been held, that under a clause in a
Railway Act similar to those now under consideration, the
execution of the works is to be carried on with a view to
the fit accommodation of the company and the public.
By a Railway Act, a company were empowered to divert or
alter any roads or ways in order the more conveniently to
carry the same over or under the railway. The company,
in carrying a road under the railway, had erected a skew
bridge, which diverted the road to an angle of forty-five
degrees instead of thirty-four degrees, which was the angle
made at that particular point by the old line of road. At
the trial of an indictment against the company’s engineer
for so doing, the learned judge directed the jury that, if
the public sustained inconvenience by the alteration, they
should find for the crown; but that, if the work was done
in a mode in which an experienced engineer would do it,
having reasonable regard to the interest both of the com
pany and the public, the company had the right to make
such diversion. The jury having found for the defendant
on the ruling, the Court refused to grant a new trial; and
it was intimated that “conveniently” means conveniently
both for the company and the public (b).
Although in this case a favourable summing up procured
a verdict for the company, yet, inasmuch as in cases where
the construction of any engineering work of a public na
ture, in conformity with the requirements of their Act,
would be of serious inconvenience to the company without
adequate advantage to the public, the company may be
relieved by an appeal to the Commissioners of Railways.
It would seem to be the better course, in all cases of dis

pute on this subject, for the company to get from the
Commissioners authority for varying the works, rather than
endeavour to justify any deviation by doubtful interpre
tations of the words of their Act. (a)
Wherever a road has been interfered with by a railway
company, in the course of executing the works, and such
road can be afterwards restored consistently with the forma
tion and use of the railway, the company are bound to
restore it. In such case, they must leave it in as good
condition as it was in when they first interfered with it, or
as near thereto as may be.
If the road cannot be restored consistently with the use
of the railway, then the company must put the substituted
road into a permanently substantial condition, equally con
venient as the former road, or as near thereto as circum
stances will allow (b). As to the interpretation to be put
upon this clause, see the cases of the Queen v. The London
and Birmingham Railway Company, and the Queen v.
Sharpe, cited above (c).
The restoration of the former road, or the proper repair
of the substituted road, must be completed, in the case of
a turnpike road, within six months after the first inter
ference with the original road; and, in the case of any
other than a turnpike road, within twelve months from the
time of such interference. The commissioners and trustees
having the management of the road in question, may, how
ever, by writing under their hands, consent to an exten
sion of the period.
On failing to restore or repair such road, as the case
may be, within the prescribed period, the company will
be liable to forfeit £5 per day to the trustees, commis
sioners, or surveyor of the road interfered with, if it be a
public road, or to the owner, if it be a private road, for
every day after the expiration of such period during which
the restoration or repair remains unfinished. This penalty

is recoverable before two justices, who may order it to be
laid out in executing the work in respect whereof it was
incurred. (a)
Where the company, in the execution of their works,
use or interfere with any existing road, they must repair
all the damage done by them to such road. If any dis
pute arise in regard to such repairs, it is to be settled by
two justices, who may direct such repairs to be done, and
within such period as they think right; and may impose
a penalty of £5 per day on the company for refusing to
carry such repairs into effect. This penalty is to be paid
to the surveyor or other person having the management
of the road, if it be a public road, and be applied for
the purposes of such road, or to the owner, if it be a
private road. In determining any question relating to
the repairs under consideration, the justices are to have
regard to, and make due allowance for, any tolls that may
have been paid by the company on such road in the
course of using it (b).
With regard to the height and dimensions of bridges
constructed for carrying the railway over any road, it is,
by the 49th section of the Railway Clauses Consolidation
Act, provided that “every bridge to be erected for the
purpose of carrying the railway over any road, shall (ex
cept where otherwise provided by the Special Act) be built
in conformity with the following regulations (that is to
say): the width of arch shall be such as to leave thereunder
a clear space of not less than thirty-five feet, if the arch be
over a turnpike road, and of twenty-five feet if over a public
carriage road, and of twelve feet if over a private road.
The clear height of the arch from the surface of the road
shall not be less than sixteen feet for a space of twelve feet,
if the arch be over a turnpike road, and fifteen feet for a
space of ten feet if over a public carriage road; and in
each of such cases, the clear height at the springing of the
arch shall not be less than twelve feet.

310 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book II1.
To carry road
over railway.
The clear height of the arch for a space of nine feet
shall not be less than fourteen feet over a private carriage
road.
What is required of the company by this section is,
that they shall, in the cases specified, form arches of the
respective widths of thirty-five, twenty-five, and twelve
feet, clear; and should the road crossed exceed these
widths respectively, they are not compelled to construct
an arch having a span equal to the width of the road;
but, provided they have an arch of the prescribed span,
, they may erect piers on the road, and have several arches
for the purpose of carrying the railway over the existing
highway (a). Although the Legislature will not compel a
company, where the road to be crossed is of a greater width
than that prescribed for the span of the arch, to carry the
railway on one arch, still it will enforce the construction of
the line strictly in compliance with the Act. But the Act
will be construed reasonably. Thus, where a railway
company were compelled by their Act to carry their line
across a road by a bridge thirty feet span, so as to form a
clear carriage road of twenty-four feet, and footpath of six
feet wide, and also to have the height of the bridge eighteen
feet clear from the surface of the road, by lowering the bed
of the road to a certain inclination, and, in the construc
tion of the works, they sunk the carriage road to the re
quired depth, but not the footpath; it was held (in error,
reversing the decision in the Court below) that they had
complied with the Act, as the words “bed of the said
road” related to the carriage way only (b).
It is further provided, in regard to bridges over rail
ways, that every bridge erected for carrying any road over
the railway shall (except as otherwise provided by the
Special Act) be built in conformity with the following re
gulations; that is to say:
(a) Attor. Gen. v. Lond. and Southampton Rail. Com. 9 Sim. 78; 1 Rail.
Ca. 302.
(b) Manch. and Leeds Rail. Com. v. Reg. 3 Rail. Ca. 633.
CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 311
The road over the bridge shall have a clear span between
the fences thereof of thirty-five feet, if the road be a turn
pike road, and twenty feet if a public carriage road, and
twelve feet if a private road.
In cases, however, where the average available width for
the passage of carriages of any existing roads, within fifty
yards of the points of crossing the same, is less than the
width above prescribed, the bridges need not be of a greater
width than the roads, provided that such bridges are never
of less width than twenty feet, in the case of a turnpike or
public carriage road.
And also, if the width of the road be afterwards increased,
the company shall widen the bridge at their own expense
to such an extent as the trustees of the road may require,
not exceeding the width of the road, or the maximum width
above prescribed (a).
Where the maximum width of a bridge is less than that
of the road, the company may not contract the latter in
the approaches to the bridge by narrowing it between the
wing walls and parapets which extend beyond the span of
the bridge over the railway (b).
Where a company were building a bridge not in con
formity with the provisions of their Act, it was held that a
mandamus would lie to compel them to build it in the
prescribed manner, although the Act gave the plaintiff
power in such case, on application to justices, to obtain an
order enabling him to build the bridge at the company’s
expense (c).
The descent made in the road, in order to carry the
same under the bridge, or the ascent, in order to carry
it over the bridge, shall not be more than one foot in
thirty feet, if the bridge be over a turnpike road, one foot

in twenty, if over a public carriage road, and one foot in
sixteen feet if over a private carriage road, not being a
tramroad or railroad; or if the same be a tramroad or
railroad, the descent or ascent shall not be greater than
the prescribed rate of inclination; and if no rate be pre
scribed, the same shall not be greater than as it existed at
the passing of the Special Act (a).
If, however, the mean inclimation of any road within
two hundred and fifty yards of the point of crossing the
same, or the inclination of such portion of the road as may
require to be altered, or for which another road, shall be
substituted, shall be steeper than the inclination above
prescribed; then the company will not be bound to improve
such existing inclination (b).
A company will not be precluded from exercising the
powers thus conferred on them to alter the existing levels
of roads, for the purpose of more conveniently carrying
them over or under the railroad, although their exercise
may be in some respects and to some extent inconvenient
and detrimental. Thus where a railway company were
empowered in the execution of their works to “raise and
sink roads or ways, in order the more conveniently to
carry them over or under, or by the side of the railway,
and, in the case of a bridge for carrying the railway over
a road, were to make the arch of a certain specified height
from the surface of the road; it was held that they were
authorised to sink the original surface of a turnpike-road,
in order to give the specified elevation to the arch of a
bridge, although the effect, from the peculiar situation of
the road, would be, to render it liable to be occasionally
flooded (c).
A good and sufficient fence is to be made on each side
of every bridge, by which a road is carried over a railway
at the expense of the company—such fence is not to be

less than four feet high, and on each side of the immediate
approaches of the bridge not less than three feet (a).
Where any bridge or fence which is to be maintained
by the company is out of repair, on complaint by the
surveyor of the road, or of two householders in the dis
trict, and ten days’ notice to the company, two justices
may order the necessary repairs to be done within a cer
tain specified time. If the company fail to obey such
order they will be liable to a penalty of five pounds a day,
which shall be applied in the execution of the necessary
works at the discretion of the justices (b).
We have already seen (c), that disputes as to the mode
in which bridges and other engineering works are to be
constructed, are to be settled by the Commissioners of
Railways on the application of either party.
Where the trustees and commissioners of any turnpike
road, or the surveyor of any highway, apprehend danger
to the passengers on such road, in consequence of horses
being frightened by the sight of engines or carriages tra
velling upon the railway, they may apply to the Commis
sioners of Railways upon the subject, after giving fourteen
days’ notice thereof to the company. If it shall appear to
the commissioners that such danger might be obviated or
lessened by the construction of any works in the nature
of a screen near to the road, they may certify to that
effect, and require the company to execute the works within
a certain time after the service of the certificate, under a
penalty of five pounds a day to the commissioners, trustees,
or surveyor, for every day during which the works remain
incomplete after the expiration of the period appointed by
the commissioners.
These screens will probably diminish the risk of acci
dents, for the consequences of which, the law afforded no
means of recovering compensation. For where the loco

persons using it as a carriage road, it was decided that
the company were not indictable as for a nuisance,
inasmuch as an interference to that extent with the right
of the public, must be taken to have been contemplated
and sanctioned by the legislature, when they gave an un
qualified right to use engines on the railway(b).
SEC. IV.- Works for the accommodation of adjoining
Lands.
WITH respect to works for the accommodation of lands
adjoining the railway, it is provided by the sixty-eighth
section of the Railways’ Clauses Consolidation Act, as fol
lows, “The company shall make and at all times there
after, maintain the following works for the accommodation
of the owners and occupiers of lands adjoining the railway;
(that is to say,)
Such and so many convenient gates, bridges, arches,
culverts, and passages, over, under, or by the sides of, or
leading to or from the railway, as shall be necessary for
the purpose of making good any interruptions caused by
the railway to the use of the lands through which the
railway shall be made; and such works shall be made
forthwith, after the part of the railway passing over such
lands shall have been laid out or formed, or during the
formation thereof.
Also sufficient posts, rails, hedges, ditches, mounds, or
other fences for separating the land taken for the use of
the railway from the adjoining lands not taken, and pro
tecting such lands from trespass, or the cattle of the owner
or occupiers thereof from straying thereout, by reason of
the railway, together with all necessary gates, made to

CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 315
open towards such adjoining lands, and not towards the
railway, and all necessary stiles; and such posts, rails,
and other fences shall be made forthwith after the taking
of any such lands, if the owner thereof shall so require,
and the said other works as soon as conveniently may be.”
With respect to the gates to be provided by the company
for the purpose of giving the owners of lands adjoining the
line access thereto, it is provided by the Railways’ Clauses
Act, that if any person omit to shut and fasten any
gate set up at either side of the railway for the accommo
dation of the owners and occupiers of adjoining lands, as
soon as the cattle, &c., have passed through, he will be
liable to forfeit for each offence the sum of forty shil
lings, recoverable as in the case of other penalties incurred
under the Act (a).
Also all necessary arches, tunnels, culverts, drains, or
other passages, either over or under, or by the sides of
the railway, of such dimensions as will be sufficient at all
times to convey the water as clearly from the lands lying
near or affected by the railway as before the making of
the railway, or as nearly so as may be; and such works
shall be made from time to time as the railway works pro
ceed.
Also proper watering places for cattle, where by rea
son of the railway, the cattle of any person occupying
any lands lying near thereto, shall be deprived of access
to their former watering-places, and such watering places
shall be so made, as to be at all times sufficiently supplied
with water as theretofore, and as if the railway had not
been made, or as nearly so as may be; and the company
shall make all necessary watercourses and drains, for the
purpose of conveying water to the said watering places.
Under a similar clause in a Special Act, the Court issued
a mandamus to the company whose line had intersected
certain closes of the plaintiff in which there were ponds,

the access to which was cut off from the several portions
by the railway, commanding them to make proper water
ing-places in such closes respectively, which they refused
to do. On a traverse of the return to this mandamus, a
doubt was expressed whether the statute applied at all to
cases where the fields in which the watering-places were
situated, were actually intersected by the railway; and
whether the damage was not a matter of compensation
under the Act; but it was held that, at all events, the
writ was erroneous in ordering the company to do more
than the Act required, namely to make a pond in each of
the several portions of the closes, which had been cut off
from the residue of such closes, and that there was nothing
on the face of the writ to shew that one watering-place
would not have been sufficient and proper for the whole of
the severed portions (a).
The company cannot be required to make accom
modation works in such a manner, as would prevent
or obstruct the working or using of the railway (b),
nor to make any accommodation works with respect
to which, the owners and occupiers of the lands
shall have agreed to receive, and shall have been paid
compensation instead of the making of them (c). Any
disputes as to the nature and number of the accommo
dation works, or as to their repair are to be settled by two
justices, who shall also determine the time within which
such works shall be commenced and executed by the com
pany (d). If for fourteen days next after the time appointed
for commencing the works, the company shall fail to com
mence them, or to proceed with them, the owner of the
lands, or the party aggrieved by such failure, may execute
them at the expense of the company, and the cost, if dis
puted, is to be settled by two justices. If the owner or

occupier of the adjoining lands execute the works, he
must not obstruct or injure the railway or any of the
works connected therewith for a longer time, nor use
them in any other manner, than is necessary for the exe
cution of such works (a). If the accommodation works
executed by the company be thought insufficient by the
owners or occupiers of the adjoining lands, they may make
at their own expense such others as they may think neces
sary, and as shall be approved of by the company, or in
cases of dispute, as shall be authorised by two justices (b).
But such works must be constructed under the superin
tendence of the company’s engineer, if the company desire
it. Nevertheless the company may not require that
plans should be adopted involving a greater expense than
that incurred in the execution of similar works by the
company, or that the plans selected should be executed in
a more expensive manner than that adopted in similar
cases by the company (c).
The power thus given to a party under the above clauses
to make the accommodation works on the default of the
company would not, it appears, take away his right to a
mandamus calling upon the company to complete any such
works (d).
After the prescribed period, or if no period be pre
scribed, after the expiration of five years from the comple
tion of the works, and the opening of the railway for pub
lic use, the owners and occupiers of lands adjoining the
railway cannot compel the company to made additional
accommodation works (e).

their Act to make between lands intersected by the rail

of way shall be affected, are at liberty to cross the rail
way, by themselves, or their servants, with horses, car
riages, and cattle.
They can only cross, however, on that part of the line
which intersects their lands, and they must cross directly;
and so as not to injure the railway or obstruct the traffic.
Moreover, they can only cross for the purpose of occupy
ing the lands, or for the exercise of the right of way. And
as soon as the communications are completed the right
ceases (a).
In cases where the owners or occupiers of the lands
have either made arrangements with the company to
receive, or have received compensation for or on account of
such communications, instead of their being made, or
have had the amount of compensation for the property
assessed and awarded, on the footing that there was to be
a total severance of the lands without any communication
being made, they are not at liberty to cross the line (b).
Therefore, where a person whose property was intersected
by the railway had the amount of compensation for his
lands assessed, on the footing of their being completely
severed, and had been paid that amount, it was held that
he was precluded from the right of crossing the line, and
that he might be treated as a trespasser by the company
for so doing (c).
But if no such agreement have been come to with the
company, and the latter have neglected to make proper
communications, proprietors and occupiers of lands inter
sected by the line are permitted to cross it at any point
within their own property; and even where by a Railway
Act the privilege was limited to certain places to be
appointed, it was held, that the words “to be appointed”
must be read with the addition of the words “when such
places shall have been appointed,” and that the parties

entitled might cross anywhere within the limits of the
land which they owned or occupied until such places were
appointed; nor were they precluded from doing so until they
had given notice to the company to make the proper com
munications (a); inasmuch as the duty of making them is
cast upon the company, and their liability cannot be
evaded either on the ground of expense, or on the ground
of having made some less convenient and more circuitous
communications than they might. Special powers in
their Act applying to the particular case, or an assessment
of damages in respect of the severed lands which contem
plates and includes compensation for such circuitous and
inconvenient mode of access, can alone discharge the com
pany from the obligation resting on them (b).
But the right of crossing the railway under certain cir
cumstances thus secured to individuals must be exercised
only for the purposes for which it was given, therefore,
where the proprietors of lands adjoining the railway have
made communications across it (as they alledge) for the
more convenient occupation of their property, and an
action of trespass is brought against them by the com
pany, it will be a question for the jury whether such com
munication has been made bond fide for the purpose
alleged, or with some ulterior object (c).
The Railways’ Clauses Act, casts upon the company the
duty of making proper communications between the lands
intersected by the line, unless they have compensated the
owners and occupiers therefor. But, besides these agree
ments for compensation, the promoters of the undertaking
may contract with the parties interested to make the ne
cessary communications themselves subject to certain re
strictions; or they may stipulate with a landowner to
make the required communications for him in some par
ticular mode. In the latter case, after a request and

The duty of maintaining all such accommodation works
as they are bound to erect and provide is thrown on the
company, and should they at any time fail to keep them

they shall have set apart for any specific purpose, with
which such communication would interfere, nor upon any
inclined plane or bridge, nor in any tunnel (a)." All dis
putes between the company and other parties as to the
proper places for openings in the ledges or flanches of the
rails are to be settled by the Commissioners of Railways (b).
In addition to the above conditions to be imposed by
the company in respect of the construction of branch
railways, the legislature has made it necessary in all cases
where the railway into which such branch railways are
to be brought is a passenger railway, (that is where more
than one-third of the gross revenue arises from the carry
ing of passengers) that the permission of the commissioners
of railways should be obtained before any junction can be
effected (c).
In using the branch railways so constructed, the per
sons making or using them, shall be subject to all bye
laws and regulations of the company from time to time
made with respect to passing upon, or crossing the rail
way and otherwise. So the persons making or using the
branch railways are to construct, and from time to time as
need may require to renew, the offsett plates and switches
according to the most approved plan adopted by the com
pany, and under the direction of their engineer (d).
The privilege of making and using branch railways
given as above, extends not only to the owners and occu
piers of lands adjoining the railway, but to any other per
sons for all time, so that a universal right, subject to the
restrictions and conditions above mentioned, and to the
consent of the parties over whose lands they are made, is
accorded to parties who may wish to construct such branch
lines.

From the terms of the section above cited, it is not
clear whether the owners of the lands intersected by the
line are authorised to cross it as well as communicate with
it, by a branch railway. The words of the section reserv
ing the right are “branches of railway to communicate
with the railway, for the purpose of bringing carriages to
or from, or upon the railway;” which do not necessarily
import a right of crossing the line, but rather lead to the
inference that the power was conferred in order to give
to the parties the advantages of a railroad from their own
property, for the purpose of transit or for the conveyance
of minerals, or otherwise. It is submitted that by the
clause of the Act now under consideration, no power is
given to carry a railroad across the main line on a level;
and that such power can only be claimed under a provision
of the Special Act, or by the custom of the country; unless
a right to do so may be considered to be given to the
owners of lands intersected by the railway under those
provisions of the statute which relate to accommodation
works (a). This question becomes of importance where a
line of railroad traverses a mineral district, and the owners
would be precluded from any profitable working of the
mines, unless they were enabled to construct tramroads
across the railway on a level.
Wherever the right of crossing the principal railway by
a branch line on the level has been claimed, it has been
so claimed either under special provisions in the Act, or
by virtue of some peculiar custom of the country; although
in one case it was contended (but the point was not de
cided), that such a right existed at common law (b).
The authority conferred by the 76th section of the
Railway Act to construct branch railways being (as we
have seen) conveyed in general terms, it is not confined to
those who at the time of the passing of the Special Act were
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 71. Semble, that this section is not qualified by the
73rd section limiting the time within which the works must be done.

owners or occupiers of the lands adjoining the railway.
Even in the cases in which the right was reserved to the
owners and occupiers of adjoining land, it has been de
cided that the right would attach to all future holders of
the lands under all future conditions of the estate (a).
So also the right extends not only to the making and
using of the railway, but to the employment of locomotive
engines thereon, although when the Act was passed such
engines were not in use (b).
On the refusal of a company to make the required open
ings in their own lines of rails, for the purpose of effecting
a communication with new branch lines, if the claimants
can show to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Rail
ways, or of the Court, that no danger will arise to the
public, or any inconvenience or obstruction be created on
the railway, on their request being complied with, a man
damus will be granted, compelling the company to do the
necessary works. Yet such a right can in no case be
exercised so as to create any public inconvenience or ob
struction (c).
SEC. VI.—Drainage of Lands in Ireland.
BY the Statute 5 & 6 Wic. c. 89, entitled, “An Act to
Promote the Drainage of Lands and Improvement of Na
vigation and Water Power in Connection with such
Drainage in Ireland,” certain commissioners are appointed
to carry the Act into execution. By the Railways Clauses
Consolidation Act, section 25, it is provided that, wherever
a Special Act shall be passed authorising a company to

construct a railway in Ireland, the company shall submit
their plans to the above-mentioned commissioners before
they commence forming the line, that they may decide
upon the number and adequacy of the waterways of all
bridges, culverts, tunnels, watercourses, and other such
works across the line, for the free and uninterrupted dis
charge of waters from the intersected lands, and upon the
height and adequacy of all bridges over waters which are
or may hereafter become navigable.
Without any unnecessary delay, the commissioners are
to investigate these matters and report thereon; and
having decided, are to give a certificate to the company
specifying the numbers, nature, dimensions, and situation,
of all such works connected with drainage as they may
deem essential, and according to which the company will
be bound to execute the works. Nor can the formation
of the line be commenced until this certificate be obtained.
And after it is granted, no deviation from it will be al
lowed without the written approbation of the commis
sioners (a).
If the company either fail to submit the plans for in
spection, or to execute any of the works in conformity with
the certificate, the commissioners may apply, in a summary
way, by petition to the Court of Chancery, and the Court
may thereupon order the company to construct the various
works as directed by the commissioners, or may restrain
them by injunction from proceeding in defiance or neg
lect of those directions, and may award costs to be paid by
the company. No powers conferred on a company by any
Special Act, or any Act incorporated therewith, will at all
prejudice or affect the powers of the commissioners above
mentioned (c).
In addition to these powers of the commissioners to see
that proper provision is made by the railway company
for the drainage of the lands through which the line is

carried, they are further authorised to interfere if any
works connected with the formation of a watercourse for
manufacturing purposes should become necessary in con
nection with the railway, such as a culvert, tunnel, or
watercourse beneath it, or an aqueduct over it; and differ
ences should arise between the directors of the railway
company and the persons interested in obtaining the
water power, in respect of the manner of executing the
proposed works, or the amount of compensation to be paid,
and either party may appeal to them; and on such appeal
they are empowered to settle the dispute, and prescribe the
works to be executed, and their decision thereon will be
final and conclusive. If they should be of opinion that
such works can be executed without injury to the railway,
and if they think proper so to do, they may undertake so
much of the works as may be in connection with the rail
way at the expense of the parties for whose benefit the
watercourse shall be made, and with all the powers and
authorities which they have for the execution of works for
drainage in general (a).
SEC. VII.—Miscellaneous Matters connected with the
Formation of the Line.
BEFoRE concluding this chapter on “The Formation of
the Line,” notice may be taken of one or two subjects
which did not conveniently fall under any of the foregoing
divisions.
And, first, we may observe, that a company, having ob
tained an Act for the construction of a railway between
two termini, are bound to complete it; and if there be any
reasonable doubt as to their intention to do so, a manda
mus will be granted compelling them. Thus, where a

326 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book III.
company incorporated for the purpose of making a railway
from L. to N., had only purchased lands, and commenced
works on a part of the line (from L. to C.), and it appeared
doubtful, from the circumstances stated on affidavit, whe
ther the company intended to proceed farther than C., a
mandamus was issued, calling upon them to complete the
whole line, to set out any proposed deviations from the
original line, and to proceed to purchase lands on the re
mainder of the line (from C. to N.), pursuant to the pro
visions of the Act (a). The writ was afterwards quashed
on the ground of its containing no averment that the com
pany had given up their design, or that they were not
effecting it with all convenient speed, and that the Court
could make no inference to that effect. But Lord Den
man, in pronouncing the judgment of the Court in this
case, has so ably and eloquently expounded the prin
ciples on which large Parliamentary powers are conferred
upon companies, and the grounds upon which the Courts
will interfere to regulate and enforce the exercise of those
powers, that we shall make some extracts from the judg
ment illustrative of those points. His lordship says, “This
is an application for a mandamus, to do certain acts
therein specified; and it was observed on both sides, in
the course of the discussion, and we think with truth, that
the questions involved in it are of much novelty, and of
at least equal importance; because as, on the one hand,
much mischief may ensue if this Court should improvi
dently enjoin the performance of things impracticable or "
improper, so, on the other, is there no higher duty cast
upon this Court than to exercise a vigilant control over
persons entrusted with large and extensive powers for
public purposes, and to enforce within reasonable bounds
the execution of such purposes, in compliance with such
powers; and the more so, as we are not aware of any other
efficient remedy. The principle upon which these powers
(a) Reg v. East. Coun. Rail. Com. 1 Rail. Ca. 509; 2 P. & D. 648.
CHAP. III.] INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY. 7
3
are conferred by the Legislature upon undertakers of this
description, are now so fully understood, that it is not
needful to do more than generally refer to them. They
are thus laid down by Lord Eldon in the well known case,
Blakemore v. The Glamorganshire Canal Company: (a)—
‘I apprehend those who come for these Acts of Parlia
ment do, in effect, undertake that they shall do and sub
mit to whatever the Legislature empowers or compels them
to do, and that they shall do nothing else; that they shall
do and forbear all that they are required to do and for
bear, as well with reference to the interests of the public
as with reference to the interests of individuals.” The
same doctrine was acted upon by this Court, in its fullest
extent, in the case of Rex v. The Inhabitants of Cum
berworth (b). It remains only to be added, that these
cases and principles have been recently recognised by the
Court of Exchequer in the case of Lee v. Milner. (c)
The reasons also which regulate the practice of this
Court in regard to writs of mandamus are very plain and
intelligible. This interference is occasioned by inferior
Courts or persons refusing to proceed in some course pre
scribed by law, and not in consequence of any misappre
hension or error in their course, provided they have
entered upon it. And, accordingly, if it had appeared
that the company were substantially complying with the
terms of their undertaking, there would have been at
once a satisfactory answer to the application. Now the
objects and purposes for which the company have been
incorporated and empowered; or which (in the words of
the passage cited) ‘The legislature has empowered and
compelled them to do and submit to, are too clear to
admit of any doubt. The title of the Act itself is, ‘for
making a railway from London to Norwich and Yarmouth;’
and the preamble recites, that the opening of an additional,
certain, and expeditious communication, not only between

328 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book III.
the towns then particularly enumerated, but also between
the metropolis and the eastern districts of the kingdom,
would be of great public advantage; the eastern terminus
being a seaport of greater consequence than any in the
eastern districts. The Act then gives a minute descrip
tion of the whole line, and a particular enumeration of all
the places through which it is to pass; so that all question
on this matter is entirely precluded. We consider it to
be equally undeniable, that to carry the railroad through
a portion only of the prescribed line,—such as a third
or a half—is a nominal, not a real compliance with the
meaning of the Act of Parliament. We are aware, that
we are met in this part of the argument by remarks upon
the difficulties or impossibility attending the execution
according to the prescribed terms. We confess, however,
that we should have felt more pressed by observations of
this nature, if we had not observed in the preamble of the
Act, which we must consider to have been proved, that
certain persons therein named (and we consider the obli
gation as extending to their successors, who may from time
to time constitute the company) were willing at their own
costs and charges to carry the said undertaking into exe
cution. Such difficulties, be they more or less, should
have been duly estimated before the undertakers pledged
themselves to the execution, for the sake of obtaining
such large and extensive powers as are most certainly
vested in them for the purposes already mentioned.
This is not a complaint by a majority of proprietors
against the governing body, but by a minority against the
conduct of the company itself, which they charge sub
stantially with a breach of faith towards them, by stopping
short of a bona fide execution of that purpose which in
duced them to become subscribers. They strongly urge
upon us the consideration, that all the sacrifices which
they have made in furtherance of their own interests may
go unrequited, or even may entail upon them additional
loss, by giving advantages to others in which they cannot
CHAP. III.] FORMATION OF THE LINE. 3.29.
share. To say that a majority of the whole body are satis
fied with the dividends they are likely to receive and are
unwilling to risk more expenditure, is obviously no answer
to them, or to the public, who created their great powers
for different purposes, or to the Parliament which was in
duced to grant them by the promise of public benefits much
more extensively diffused” (a).
Nor is the neglect or refusal of the company to complete
the railway throughout, the only mode of evading the
obligations imposed upon them by their Act of Incorpora
tion, for they are bound not only to construct the line, but
to maintain it in such a state of repair as shall make it
suitable for the purposes contemplated by the Legislature,
in conferring authority to make it. Therefore where a
railway was made under the authority of an Act of Par
liament by which the company was incorporated, and by
which it was provided that the public should have the
beneficial enjoyment of the same, and the company after
wards took up the railway, a mandamus was issued, com
pelling them to reinstate it (b).
A railway company is bound to have the line measured,
and to cause milestones, posts, or other conspicuous ob
jects to be set up and maintained along the whole length
thereof, at the distance of one quarter of a mile from each
other, with numbers or marks described thereon denoting
such distances; and it is only when these milestones are
erected, and so long as they are properly maintained,
that tolls can be taken on the line. Any person wilfully
pulling down, defacing, or destroying any such mile
stones, will incur a penalty not exceeding five pounds for
every such offence, recoverable summarily before two jus
tices (c).
At the request of the Commissioners of Railways, the
company are bound to allow any person or persons au

thorised by them, with servants and workmen, to enter
upon their lands, and to lay down, adjoining the line of
the railway, a line of electrical telegraph for her Majesty’s
service. For the privilege of constructing and using this
telegraph, reasonable remuneration is to be paid to the
company, and if theycannot agree with the Commissioners
as to the amount, it is to be settled by arbitration. Sub
ject to the prior right of her Majesty, the company may
use the telegraph for the purposes of the railway, upon
terms to be agreed on between the parties, or settled by
arbitration (a).
If a telegraph have been established on a railway by the
company, or by any other persons, otherwise than for the
exclusive use of the company, or for the exclusive use of
her Majesty, or for both, all persons alike are to have the
privilege of sending and receiving messages by it at equal
charges, and subject to reasonable regulations by the
company (b). Under this section a railway company are
not to be compelled to establish a telegraph for the pur
poses of the public, but in case one has been established
and used otherwise than exclusively for her Majesty or the
company, it will be open to the user of all; upon the
payment of equal charges.
By the 9 & 10 Vic. c. 57, provisions are made, regulat
ing the gauge ofrailways thereafter to be constructed; and
it is enacted (c) that after the passing of the Act (d), it shall
not be lawful to construct any railway for the conveyance
of passengers on any gauge other than four feet eight and
a half inches in Great Britain, and five feet three inches
in Ireland; but existing railways of any other guage may
be maintained as at present, and new lines of rails laid
down when necessary at any point within the original limits
of deviation of such railways. The general rule above
prescribed as to gauge will not apply to any railway to be
constructed under any existing or future Act, which defines

the gauge or gauges thereof; nor to any railway which in
its whole length shall be southward of the Great Western;
nor to any in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, or
Somerset, for which Acts were obtained in the last session
of Parliament, or which were then in course of construc
tion. The Act further excepts out of its operation certain
branches and continuations of the Great Western Rail
way (a); and the general effect of it is to appropriate a
certain district of England and Wales to the advocates of
the broad gauge, leaving the rest of the kingdom to be
accommodated by lines formed on the narrow gauge.
Since the passing of this measure it is not lawful to alter
the gauge of any passenger railway (b). A penalty of ten
pounds per mile per day will be inflicted on the company
for any construction or alteration of their line incon
sistent with the above provisions; and the Commissioners
of Woods and Forests, or the Commissioners of Railways
may abate and remove the portions so unlawfully con
structed or altered, and restore the site to its former con
dition (c).
A penalty is imposed upon all persons obstructing the
construction of a line of railway by the 24th section of
the Railways’ Clauses Consolidation Act which enacts that,
“If any person wilfully obstruct any person acting under
the authority of the company in the lawful exercise of their
power in setting out the line of the railway, or pull up or
remove any poles or stakes driven into the ground for the
purpose of so setting out the line of railway, or deface or
destroy any marks made for the same purposes, he shall
forfeit a sum not exceeding £5 for every such offence, to

UNDER this general head it is proposed to treat, of
such preliminaries as are required by statute to be ob
served previous to the railway being opened for traffic:
of the common law and statutory obligations and liabili
ties of the company, both as owners and proprietors of
the line, and as carriers of goods and passengers upon it:
of the regulations made by the Legislature (or under
powers conferred by them,) in respect of the construction
and user of engines and carriages, whether belonging to
the company or to third parties: of parliamentary provi

certain times and rates of speed, and under certain restric
tions: of tolls, fares, and charges, their publication and
revisal, the amount which may be demanded, and the
mode in which they may be recovered: of such bye-laws
as relate more immediately to the user of the railway, as
those prescribing the duties of the company’s servants,
and regulating their conduct and that of the public who
come upon the line: of the public burdens cast upon rail
way companies in respect of their profits as owners of the
line and common carriers, and in respect of their occupa
tion of the land on which the railroad and the stations
are constructed, as duties levied in respect of passengers,
poor’s rate, and tithe rent charge: and, lastly, of those
returns required to be made to Government, or certain
public officers, which are closely connected with the work

accidents.

CHAPTER I.
OPENING OF THE RAILWAY.
WHEN the works on a railway are so near completion
as to enable the company, with a due regard to the safety
of the public, to open the line for traffic, one calendar
month’s notice in writing of an intention so to open it
must be given to the Commissioners of Railways (a); and
a notice of ten days of the time when, in the opinion of
the company, the line will be sufficiently completed for
the safe conveyance of passengers, and will be ready for
inspection (b). These notices may be served, either by
being left at the office of the Commissioners in London,
or by transmission through the post directed to the secre
tary at their office (c). A penalty of £20 will be incurred
by the company for every day during which the railway,
or any part of it, shall have been opened, and continued
open, before the service and expiration of these notices.
This penalty may be recovered in any of Her Majesty’s
Courts of Record, or in the Court of Session, or in any
of the Sheriff's Courts in Scotland (d).
Within the period limited by the above notices, the
Commissioners of Railways are to make arrangements
for an examination of the works, to ascertain their fitness
and stability, with a view to secure the safety of the pub
lic. For this purpose they may authorise any proper
person or persons to inspect the railway,who shall thereupon
have full power, at all reasonable times, to enter upon and
examine the line, and the stations, works and buildings, and
the engines and carriages belonging thereto (e). The pro

ment of inspector who should within one year have been
a director, or have held any office of trust or profit under
a railway company, has been judiciously repealed (a). Its
effect must necessarily have been to exclude from the office
of inspector all the persons best fitted by education and
experience for the efficient discharge of its duties, and
without any adequate reason. These inspectors are not
permitted to interfere in any way in the affairs of the
company (b). -
If any person wilfully obstruct an inspector duly ap
pointed in the execution of his duties, he will be liable to
forfeit the sum of £10 for every such offence, recoverable
before a justice of the peace, who, on default of payment
within the time limited for that purpose, may commit the
offender to prison for any period not exceeding three
months, to be at once determined, bewever, on payment
of the fine (c).
If the person appointed to inspect the railway and works
report to the commissioners that, in his opinion, the open
ing of the line at the time proposed would be attended
with danger to the public, by reason of the incompleteness
of the works or permanent way, or the insufficiency of the
establishment for working such railway, and state the
grounds of that opinion in his report, the commissioners
may order the opening to be postponed for any period not
exceeding one calendar month. If, at the expiration of
that period, and on further inspection, he should still re
port it unsafe to open the line for traffic, the commissioners
may again defer the opening for a month; and so on from
time to time, until it appear to the commissioners that
such opening may take place without danger to the
public (d). If the company, in defiance of the order of the
commissioners, proceed to open the railway, or any part
of it, they will incur a penalty of £20, recoverable as in
ordinary cases, for every day during which it shall con

tinue open contrary to such order. This penalty, however,
will not be incurred unless, together with the order of the
commissioners, there be delivered to the company a copy
of the report of the inspector on which the order was
made (a).
Before the company can take any tolls for the use of the
railway (and, therefore, practically, before it is opened),
lists of the tolls and rates chargeable thereon must be
made out, and exhibited as hereinafter mentioned (b). So
no tolls can be demanded by the company until they shall
have caused the railway to be measured, and mile-stones,
posts, or other conspicuous objects, to be set up at the dis
tance of one quarter of a mile from each other, with
numbers or marks thereon denoting the distances (c).
These several preliminaries having been duly observed,
and the sanction of the Commissioners of Railways ob
tained in the manner prescribed, the company may pro
ceed to open their line for traffic, and to use it both by
themselves and the public for the carriage of goods and
passengers; demanding and receiving, therefor, certain
tolls and rates, under and subject to all the restrictions and
regulations hereinafter particularly mentioned.

CHAPTER II.
luSER OF THE LINE.
A RAILwAY may be worked in several different ways :
either by the company, as owners of the road, exacting a
toll for the use thereof from any parties who may choose
to claim and exercise their right under the general and
special Railway Acts to run trains thereon, finding their
own engines, carriages, and trucks;—which may be called
a user by the public; or, secondly, by the company them
selves, both as owners of the road and as carriers, with
their own vehicles, and engines, or, thirdly, in case
they have special powers in their Act for that purpose,
by their leasing the railway to any person, or other
company. If the first plan be adopted (which, how
ever, for reasons hereinafter assigned, rarely happens)
the rights, duties, and liabilities of the company in re
spect of third parties will be regulated by the special Act
in conjunction with the general Railway Acts; if they run
their own trains upon the line for their own profit they
will be common carriers, and as such (unless specially
exempted by some particular statute) will be bound by the
custom of the realm relating to that class of persons, subject
to the provisions in respect of tolls and charges contained in
their Special Act, and will have the same rights, remedies,
duties, and liabilities, and be exposed to the same penalties
for negligence, fraud, or misconduct. If the line be leased,
all the rights and liabilities of the company, as owners and
proprietors thereof, will be transferred to the lessees;
and the latter will acquire and incur such claims and re
sponsibilities as are incident to the position (whether as
carriers of goods or passengers), in which they place them
selves as workers of the railway.

provisions in the General and Special Railway Acts, or by
virtue of some contract or agreement entered into with the
company.
It appears to have been the object of the Legisla
ture, whilst they conferred large and extensive powers
on railway companies for the formation and maintenance
of their lines, to reserve and secure to the public the right
of using them under certain conditions as public high
ways; for by the enactments of the railway statutes, a
railway is to be open to all persons to run trains thereon,
with engines and carriages properly constructed, upon
tender or payment of the tolls by the Special Act autho
rised to be taken. Those who propose to exercise this
right must comply with all the provisions of the 8 Vic. c.
20, as to the construction of engines and carriages (a),
and with the several bye-laws and regulations made and
published by the company, in respect of the rate at which
the trains are to run, their times of starting and of stop
ping, the mode of loading and unloading the trucks, the
receipt and delivery of goods, and the like (b). Any re
fusal on the part of a company to permit a user of the
line by persons ready to perform and submit to all the
required conditions, would render them liable to have a
writ of mandamus issued, compelling them to comply in
this respect with the terms on which their extensive powers
and privileges were conferred.
A railway company regarded in this light, as simply
owners of the way on which others may place steam power

and carriages, and convey persons and goods, stand in
much the same relation to the parties so using it as the
trustees of a turnpike road to the coach and postmasters
and carriers conveying goods and passengers upon it. (a)
Although any of the public have an abstract right to (b) User by
run their own engines and carriages upon a line of railway,
third parties
under a special
or to become common carriers thereon, and could enforce £ with
it against a company by process of law, still there are, prac
tically, so many difficulties and hindrances in the way of
its profitable exercise, that it is rarely, if ever, attempted
by parties in a hostile or even independent manner. Thus
there is no mode of compelling a company to supply the
engines of such persons with water or fuel, or to give faci
lities and accommodation for the loading and unloading of
goods; so that it is clear that, unless with the permission
of, or under some private arrangement with, the company,
the power reserved is nugatory and unavailable. More--
over, the maximum rate of tolls that may be lawfully de
manded is far too high for the lucrative user of the railway
by third parties; and hence the right for that purpose
secured to them by the letter of the law is rarely attempted
to be enforced. With the great advantages, too, which
the company possess, they find it more profitable to exer
cise their power of carrying goods and passengers on their
own account; and hence it is seldom that any of the public
have made use of the line with their own engines and
carriages, except in particular branches of trade, such as
the carrying of coal or minerals, and under the terms of
some express arrangement with the company. The stipu
lations and conditions of contracts of this nature vary, of
course, as frequently and as widely as the circumstances
and objects of the contracting parties, and no general rule
can be laid down upon the subject. All such agreements
must, however, be made with a reference to that provision
of the 8 Vic. c. 20, which requires that all tolls should be

charged equally to all persons under like circumstances,
and renders any reduction or advance in such tolls, either
directly or indirectly in favour of or against any particular
company or person, illegal. (a) The arrangement most
commonly made between railway companies and carriers,
or other persons using the line, is, that the company shall
find the locomotive power required, charging therefor so
much per ton per mile, including mileage and all other
dues; shall provide sheds and warehouses for the reception
of goods; and platforms, turn-tables, cranes, and all other
apparatus necessary for loading and unloading; whilst the
other contracting party undertakes to furnish the requisite
carriages and trucks, truck-sheets, and other articles of
that nature, and to load, unload, collect, and deliver the
goods. Whatever be the precise terms and conditions of
the agreement, the party contracting with the company,
and using the railway under that contract, is subject to
all such bye-laws and regulations of the company as to
carriages, trains, tolls, &c., as the latter may lawfully make
and enforce.
SEC. II.—User of the Railway by the Company as Common
Carriers.
ALTHouGH a railway company is empowered, it is not
compelled to work the line with its own engines and car
riages, there being no statutory or common law obligation
upon them to that effect. The “Railway Clauses Conso
lidation Act” only provides that “it shall be lawful for
them to use it in such manner, and to make reasonable
charges in respect thereof, not exceeding the rate of tolls
by the special Act authorised to be taken (b). Hence the
Court of Queen’s Bench will not issue a mandamus to

compel a company to find engines and carriages for the
conveyance of the goods of a party; nor, unless the com
pany have made themselves common carriers by taking
goods of other persons, would he have any right at com
mon law against the company for not carrying his goods
when offered (a). His purpose could only be effected by
his availing himself of his right to put his own engines
and carriages upon the line, in conformity with the regu
lations of the company in that behalf, or by his employ
ing some other person, who was a common carrier running
trains thereon, to convey his goods.
Although, however, it is not, in the first instance,
compulsory upon a railway company to become common
carriers, yet they may avail themselves of their right to
unite both characters, (that of owners of the way and
carriers upon it) and having once made their election by
conveying goods in the latter capacity, they will be liable
accordingly, on the ordinary principles of the common
law, and irrespective of the provisions of their act of incor
poration. Therefore where a railway Act authorised the
company, if they should think fit, to carry goods and pas
sengers on the railway, they being bound to keep and
repair the fences of the same; and the company undertook
to carry some horses to be delivered safely at a parti
cular place, but in consequence of some of the fences
being broken down, an accident happened to the train,
whereby the horses were injured, and the owner brought
an action against them, as common carriers, to recover
damages, they were held not entitled to notice of action
under the clause to that effect in their Act, as for some
thing done or omitted to be done in pursuance thereof,
but their common-law liability as carriers might be enforced
by the ordinary remedies as in other cases, and irrespec
tive of any privileges or protection conferred on them in
relation to other matters in their Special Act (b).

But whilst it is true that, generally speaking, a rail
way company are not compelled to make themselves car
riers of goods and passengers, yet in certain cases (to be
noticed hereafter (a), as the conveyance of mails, of mili
tary and police, of public stores, &c., this obligation is
expressly imposed upon them by the legislature. Subject
to these statutory provisions the company are entitled and
empowered to convey goods and passengers upon their own
line, and also to contract with the owners of other rail
ways for the use of them in connection with their own,
by which means they become common carriers, not merely
over their own road, but also over the others so contracted
to be used (b).
The Railways’ Clauses Consolidation Act expressly
provides (c) that nothing contained either in that or the
Special Act, shall extend to make a railway company liable
further or in any other case than where,according to the laws
of the realm, stage-coach proprietors and common carriers
would be liable; nor in any degree to deprive the com
pany of any protection or privilege which common carriers
or stage-coach proprietors may be entitled to; but, on the
contrary, the company is, at all times, to be entitled to the
benefit of every such protection and privilege. Hence it
will be necessary to notice briefly the leading rights, duties,
and responsibilities of railway companies, considered as
common carriers. In doing so we shall, in the first place,
treat of a company as carriers of goods; and, in the second
place, as carriers of passengers.
(1) Rights and Obligations of a Railway Company as
Carriers of Goods.
A RAILwAY company, as common carriers, are bound by
the custom of the realm to receive and carry all goods, such

as they are in the habit of carrying, brought to them for
the purpose of transport, upon receiving a suitable hire (a);
and on their refusal to comply with the request of a party
ready and willing to make a reasonable compensation, they
will be liable to an action at law (b).
Although the party requiring goods to be carried must
be ready and willing to pay a reasonable compensation in
respect thereof, yet it is not necessary, in order to sustain
an action against the company for refusal to carry on the
tender of a reasonable sum, that he should have made a
strictly legal tender of the amount of toll, if a readiness to
pay it be shown. The receipt of the goods by the
company, and the payment of the charge for carriage,
are contemporaneous acts; the carrier being bound to
receive the goods on the money being paid or tendered,
and the party delivering them being bound to pay the
reasonable amount demanded on the acceptance of
the goods (c). The demand, therefore, must be made
by the railway company at the time of the goods being
offered; and it is only on the neglect or refusal of the
party to pay it, that the company can refuse to carry
the goods.
But if the particular train by which the goods are re
quired to be conveyed be full, or if the goods are of a
dangerous nature, as combustibles or explosive and deton
ating compounds; or such as they are not in the habit and
have not the means of carrying; or if they are delivered
for the purpose of carrying at an unreasonable time (e);
in any of these cases, the company will have reasonable

grounds of refusal, and may defend with success an action
brought against them for such refusal (a).
As to articles of a dangerous nature, such as gunpowder,
aquafortis, lucifer matches, and the like, not only are the
company not required by law to carry them, but a penalty
is imposed (b) upon any person sending by a railway any
such goods, unless the nature of them be distinctly marked
on the outside of the package, or notice in writing be given
to the book-keeper, or the servant of the company with
whom they are left; and the company may refuse to carry
any goods which they suspect to be of a dangerous nature;
or they may require the parties to open the packages to
ascertain the fact. Public policy in relation to the safety
of the public, and of the servants and porters of the
company, and the security of other goods conveyed
upon the line, obviously require and justify the above
restrictions.
The company, under their power to make bye-laws, are
authorised to regulate the time for the receipt of goods to
be carried by them; and they cannot be compelled to carry
any, unless the party offering them comply with all rea
sonable regulations made in that behalf. Thus, when a
railway company gave notice that goods delivered after a
particular hour would be forwarded on the next working
day, it was held that they were not bound to forward goods
received after that hour the same evening; and that the
company were not liable to damages in a case where the
articles (which were of a perishable nature) suffered dete
rioration by the delay (c). So, on the other hand, whilst
they should be sent in time for the train by which they are
to be carried, the goods should not be sent too soon, as the
company are not obliged to receive them until within a
reasonable time of the period fixed for setting out on the

journey (a). Consequently, it would be no breach of their
duty as common carriers to refuse to take in goods which
were not to be forwarded till some time subsequently, and
which would therefore require to be warehoused in the in
terval; although, if they did receive them, they would be
liable for their safe custody until their carriage and deli
very, as in ordinary cases.
A railway company is entitled to reasonable compensa
tion for the carriage of goods, and may demand such com
pensation previous to taking charge of the goods; and if it
is not paid, may refuse to take them. As to what charges
are reasonable and equal, see post (b).
A railway company is not only bound to receive and
carry for reasonable hire the goods offered for transport,
but also to take proper care of all such goods committed
to their charge from the moment they receive them; to
obey the directions of the owner in respect to them; to
carry them safely to the proper place of destination; and
to make a right delivery of them there according to the
usage of trade or the course of business (c).
These general duties of a railway company as common
carriers will involve the obligation of providing suitable
vehicles for the carrying of goods (d), with proper truck
sheets, coverings, and tarpaulins; to protect the goods both
from fire, rain, and robbery; also to provide suitable places
for the deposit of the goods previous to delivery, and to
appoint a sufficient number of servants for the protection
of the property committed to their charge.
The common-law liability of carriers for losses and in
juries occurring in respect of goods conveyed by them,
attaches the moment the goods are intrusted to their
charge, and continues until they are delivered into the

hands of the party to whom they are consigned; and in
the case of a railway company which have made themselves
carriers, even though the final place of destination be not
upon their own lime of railway, and the loss or damage
occurs after the goods have been safely delivered to another
railway company, to be forwarded to the consignee. Thus
where a parcel directed to a person in Derbyshire was
delivered at Lancaster to the Lancaster and Preston Rail
way Company, whose line extended only to Preston, and
they delivered it safely to another company, they were
held responsible for it; Rolfe, B. telling the jury in his
summing up, that if a party brought a parcel to a railway
station, knowing at the time that they only carried to a
particular place, and they received and booked it to the
place to which it was directed, without limiting their
responsibility by express agreement to a part only of the
distance, that is prima facie evidence, that they undertake
to carry it to that place; and the Court of Exchequer, on
motion for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection, con
firmed that view. (a).
The duty of a company to deliver, and their responsibility
for the proper and safe delivery of goods received and
booked by them to the place of their destination will,
however, depend on the general usage and course of their
trade (b). If they have adopted the practice of collecting
and delivering goods for one party they may be compelled
to do so for another, but if the course of trade has been to
carry only from terminus to terminus, they cannot be
compelled to deliver. It is a general practice for common
carriers to contract with a railway company to carry for
them, and in such cases the liability of the company ordi
marily extends no farther than between the termini of the
line or lines of railway along which the goods are to be

carried, the carriers undertaking the collecting and trans
mission of them to the company’s warehouses, and the
forwarding and delivering of them to the consignees. In
any such case the carrier is, so far as the company are
concerned, the consignor at one end of the line and the
consignee at the other, and the safety of the property in
the interval is all that the company are responsible for.
A railway company transmitting goods along their line
under such a contract, are not common carriers in rela
tion to the individual owners of the goods, nor respon
sible to them as such for any loss or damage which may
arise during the journey, but are to be regarded in law as
the servants of the carrier to whom the property is en
trusted; and to whom the common law liability will
attach, whilst the company will be liable even to him for
negligence or defaults. Under these circumstances the
company would only be responsible to the owner of goods
in a case in which the carrier was exempt, and for the
consequences oftheir own neglect or misconduct.
The liability under consideration is said to extend to
all losses except those occasioned by the act of God, or the
King's enemies: to which may be added those which are
attributable entirely to the defaults or neglect of the
consignor. Thus a company would not be responsible to
a party for any damage or injury which occurred through
the improper packing of the goods by the latter; nor for
the consequences of internal decay in the case of goods of
a perishable nature; nor for any mischief resulting to
animals consigned to them for conveyance from excessive
timidity or a vicious temper, provided all reasonable pre
cautions have been taken for the prevention of any such loss
or injury (a).
By the expression “the act of God,” is to be understood
not only natural accidents and events, such as lightnings,
earthquakes, tempests, frosts, and floods; but inevitable

casualties arising from no negligence on the part of man,
and which human prudence could neither have foreseen
nor prevented (a).
The great responsibility amounting to that of insurers (b),
which attached to carriers at common law, and which they
made many efforts to limit by notices and agreements, has
been at length restricted in certain cases by the legislature.
Thus the 11 Geo. 4, and 1 W. 4. c. 68, commonly known
as “The Carriers’ Act,” after reciting the responsibility of
common carriers and coach proprietors, and their liabilily
for depredations committed in respect of parcels and
packages of great value in small compass, entrusted to
them for conveyance, enacts “That from and after the
23rd July, 1830, no mail-contractor, stage-coach proprietor,
or other common carrier by land for hire shall be liable
for the loss of, or injury to, any article or articles, or pro
perty of the descriptions following: (that is to say) gold
or silver coin of this realm, or of any foreign state, or any
gold or silver in a manufactured or unmanufactured state,
or any precious stones, jewellery, watches, clocks, or time
pieces of any description, trinkets, bills, notes of the
Governor and Company of the Bank of England, Scotland,
and Ireland respectively, or of any other bank in Great
Britain or Ireland, orders, notes or securities for the pay

title-deeds, printings, engravings, pictures, gold or silver
plate, or plated articles, glass, china, silks in a manufac
tured or unmanufactured state, and whether wrought up or
not wrought up with other materials, furs or lace, or any
of them, contained in any parcel or package which shall
have been delivered either to be carried for hire or to
accompany the person of any passenger in any mail, or
stage-coach, or other public conveyance, when the value

of such article or articles, or property aforesaid, contained
in such parcel or package shall exceed the sum of ten
pounds; unless at the time of the delivery thereof at the
office, warehouse, or receiving-house ofsuch mail-contractor,
stage-coach proprietor, or other common carrier, or to his,
her, or their book-keeper, coachman, or other servant, for
the purpose of being carried, or of accompanying the
person of any passenger as aforesaid, the value and nature
of such article or articles or property shall have been
declared by the person or persons sending or delivering
the same, and such increased charge as hereinafter men
tioned, or an engagement to pay the same, be accepted by
the person receiving such parcel or package.”
As the liabilities of railway companies when they be
come common carriers, are identical with those of the
latter, whether at common law or as restricted by the
statute, the cases which have determined the nature
and limits of those liabilities, will be applicable also
under similar circumstances to railway companies.
Thus a company (having duly notified, by public notice
affixed in their office, the increased rate of charges autho
rised by the Act) (a), will not be liable for the loss of any
goods of the kinds enumerated in the above section,
unless the party offering them states their nature and
value at the time of delivery, and pays or engages to pay
an increased charge according to the scale given in the Act.
It was formerly doubted whether the Act protected a car
rier from the consequence of gross neglect, where loss or
damage thereby occurred in respect of any of the enume
rated articles, although the consignor had failed to comply
with the conditions imposed; (b) but it has been recently
held that the carrier is, in such case, exempted from lia
bility, even though the mischief happened through the gross
negligence of his servants (c). The latter, however, remain

responsible, as before, for the results of their own personal
neglect and carelessness (a), and the carrier remains liable
as before for their felonious acts (b).
Notices inef- The ordinary responsibility of a carrier is restricted by
£"" the above statute only in respect of the articles therein
enumerated, and from and after the period of its coming
into operation, no notice or declaration made on the part of
any public carrier will avail to limit or in any way affect his
liability of common law in relation to goods not expressly
named in the Act (c). The latter provision is of im
portance at the present time, inasmuch as railway com
panies, by public notices exhibited at their various sta
tions, attempt to limit their liability in respect of articles
not within the words nor even the spirit of the Carriers'
Act. Thus notices are frequently posted limiting their
liability for passengers' luggage unless specially booked
and a receipt given for it; and as to horses and other
valuable animals that they will not be liable for them
beyond a specified amount, unless they are insured on cer
tain terms; and in many other instances. It is hardly
necessary to remark that all such notices are entirely
nugatory, and that companies cannot thereby exonerate
themselves from the consequences to which they are liable
by the custom of the realm for injury or damage occur
ring through their default to passengers' baggage, or any
other articles not enumerated in the statute (d). Nor will
any such public notice, though brought to the knowledge
of a consignor, operate in any way, or to any extent, as
by the terms of a special contract between the parties in
relation to the classes of goods therein mentioned, so as
to vary the common law liability of the company as car
riers.

as to the conveyance of goods of any description or value.
Under such contract the carrier may stipulate for a
limited liability in respect of the goods to be carried, and
(subject to the provision in the Railways Clauses Act that
charges be equal) for the amount of remuneration to be
paid for the conveyance. But a refusal on the part of an
individual to enter into any agreement on the subject, will
not exonerate the company from their duty as common
carriers to carry the goods of such a party on tender or pay
ment of a reasonable sum; or (if the goods be within the
Carriers’ Act) of the sum thereby authorised. Nor, if
entered into, will any such agreement have the effect of
exempting the company from liability in cases of gross
negligence and fraud. The issuing of public notices by
advertisement or printed bills, or the affixing them on
boards in the receiving-houses and offices of the company,
will not (as we have seen), though known to the consignor
or owner of the goods, be deemed to constitute a special
contract. As to what will be considered sufficient proof
of such contract, see Palmer v. Grand Junction Railway
Company (a).

The company are bound to carry any person offering

carry any person so presenting himself they will be liable
to an action at the suit of such party (a). It does not
appear, however, that the company are bound to carry any
person offering himself either at a terminal or at any in
termediate station unless there be room in the carriages
about to start. With respect to intermediate stations, it
is customary for the company to affix a notice in their
offices, that they do not engage to carry passengers except
conditionally on there being sufficient room in the train,
and that if all who have taken tickets cannot be accom
modated, preference will be given to those travelling
longer over those travelling shorter distances.
The company are also bound to convey passengers to
their journey’s end, and to put them down at the usual
place of stopping (b). If the passenger travels by a train
advertised to stop at certain intermediate stations, the
company must put him down at any one of such stations
for which he may have booked himself and paid his fare,
and to give him due notice of his arrival at that station.
For any neglect or omission in this respect they will be
liable; but if they have taken due care, the passenger, if
he be carried beyond his destination, must bear the conse
quences himself.
Many railway companies are in the habit of letting out,
at increased prices, special trains for the immediate and
speedy conveyance of parties requiring such accommoda
tion. There seems to be no obligation upon them, either
by statute or at common law, to furnish such trains to
any party applying; yet it would seem that if such appli
cation has been granted, and the passenger has taken his
seat, they would be bound to proceed if the fare were
tendered (c).

happen on occasions of particular importance that the granting of a special

The company are bound to use the utmost care and (b) To take
diligence, and to take all proper precautions against acci
dents to passenger trains. Hence they must provide suit
able engines and carriages for the conveyance of persons
travelling by the railway; and, as carriers of passengers,
they will be liable for any accident occuring either through
a defect in their original construction, or through any want
of proper repair (a). So they will be liable for any over
loading or improper arrangement of the carriages in a
train, and for any mismanagement in the hours or order
of starting, whereby collision, or other accident, is occa
sioned. They must, moreover, provide able and skilful
persons as engine-drivers, guards, &c.; and for any rash
ness, ignorance, or misconduct of their servants, by means
of which injury is caused to a passenger, they will be re
sponsible (b).
They must also, as proprietors of the line, make, and at
all times maintain, the railway itself in such a state as that
trains may pass along it without risk of accident; and if
any mischief occur through the improper laying of rails or
sleepers, through any slips in embankments or cuttings,
through any displacement of the rail or obstruction thereon,
which greater caution might have enabled them to avoid,
they will be answerable for the consequence. For, by the
custom of the realm, their undertaking is to carry passen
gers safely (so far as human care and providence can ex
tend (c)), to their place of destination; and, therefore, for
the results of any unfitness for the purposes of travelling
of the railroad itself, or of the engines and carriages of the
train; or of any incapacity, negligence, or misconduct, on
the part of those employed by them; or of any forgetful

mess, oversight, or want of diligent precaution, they will
be liable (a .
Although, however, a railway company undertake for the
employment of the utmost care, diligence, and caution in
carrying passengers, and will, therefore, be responsible
even for slight negligence; yet, as not being insurers, or
undertaking absolutely, and without qualification, for the
safe conveyance of their passengers, they will not be re
sponsible for mere accidents; that is, for casualties the
result of no imprudence or negligence of theirs, and against
which even extreme precautions would have been no pro
tection (b). When everything has been done which human
care and foresight can suggest, the company are exone
rated; hence, though a passenger be injured by an acci
dent occurring to the train by which he is travelling, the
company are not liable unless there has been negligence(c).
Nevertheless, in proving that the train and railway are
exclusively under the care of the company, the plaintiff
makes out against them a primá facie case of negligence,
which they must disprove, by showing the cause of the
occurrence, and explaining how it happened(d); and in the
absence of any such explanation, the ordinary liability will
attach, and the company will not be exonerated from the
consequences of the accident.
A railway company are liable to an action not only at
the suit of persons who may be injured through their de
fault, but, if the injury prove fatal, to an action by their
executors or administrators. Until recently, the law of
England, whilst it gave an individual who suffered an injury
through the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another, a
remedy by action, by which he might recover a compen

sation in damages for the loss he sustained, afforded no
relief if the consequences of such negligence or miscon
duct were fatal to the person affected. In such cases, a
penalty was imposed upon the party in default, in the
shape of a deodand upon the chattel which was the imme
diate cause of death, but no satisfaction was given to the
injured parties. Thus, for the less injury of fracture or
contusion, compensation might be recovered; but for the
greater the law afforded no remedy. But by the 9 & 10
Vic. c. 93, this anomaly has been removed, and it is pro
vided that in all cases in which, if death had not ensued,
the party injured would have been entitled to maintain
an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then
and in every such case the person who would have been
liable if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action
for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person in
jured, and although the death shall have been caused under
such circumstances as amount in law to felony. The
second section of the statute enacts, that every such action
shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and
child of the person whose death shall have been so caused,
and shall be brought in the name of his executor or ad
ministrator, and the damages recovered shall be divided
among the parties for whose benefit the action is brought,
as the jury may direct. Any action by executors or ad
ministrators under these circumstances must be brought
within twelve calendar months after the death of the de
ceased; nor can more than one such action be maintained
for the same subject matter of complaint.
It is the duty of a company not only to protect the
lives and limbs of their passengers, but also to attend to
their convenience and comfort (for which the passengers
are understood to contract), and to secure them by such
reasonable rules and regulations as they are empowered to
make and enforce. Thus, the trains must start at the
times, and stop at the places, indicated in the time-table;
the usual intervals must be allowed for refreshment, ex

cept in cases of emergency, or unusual delay arising from
accidents; nor should any of these arrangements be
altered arbitrarily or capriciously, or without notice to
the public (a). So the journey should (accidents and
unavoidable hindrances, from the state of the weather or
otherwise, excepted) be performed within a reasonable
limit of the time appointed; and although the non-arrival
of the train at the terminus, or at any intermediate sta
tion, might not give a passenger a right of action against
the company for any injury which he may sustain thereby;
unless, perhaps, the delay arose from the gross negligence
or default of the company; yet should the train be dis
patched before the time appointed, it is probable that an
action would be maintainable against the company for
damages, at the suit of a party who had suffered any loss
thence arising(b).
The liability of the company extends not only to the
persons but also to the baggage of travellers, nor can this
liability be limited or varied by any notice of their own (c).
When once the baggage of a passenger has been entrusted
to any properly authorised servant of the company, the
latter will be responsible for its safe transit and delivery,
and will be liable to make good any loss or injury which
may occur whilst it is in their custody; even though it
may not have been booked and paid for separately (d).
Nor does this responsibility cease on the arrival of the
train at the terminal or other station to which the passen

is delivered to him. Yet he must claim it within a rea
sonable time (a). In relation to all such personal baggage
as they are accustomed to carry, and the passenger is
entitled to take, their responsibility is that of common
carriers of goods; although no specific compensation be
given for its conveyance, that being deemed part of the
service for which the fare is paid (b). By baggage is to be
understood such articles of necessity or personal conveni
ence as are usually carried by passengers for their per
sonal use, and not merchandise or other valuables,
although carried in the trunks of passengers, which are
not designed for any such use, but for other purposes,
such as a sale and the like (c). The Special Act usually
contains a clause prescribing the quantity of luggage
which a passenger in each class of carriages shall be per
mitted to take without extra charge; and the general rail
way statutes contain regulations on this subject in relation
to passengers by cheap trains, and by trains for the con
veyance of military and police (d).

of the parties running trains upon a railroad, in respect
of the engines and carriages to be used, spring from three
sources:—from the custom of the realm, which requires
them as common carriers to provide such as are fit and
suitable for the purpose:—from the Railways’ Clauses Act,
which prescribes certain definite regulations in respect of
them —and from the bye-laws of individual companies
who are, by statute, empowered to lay down and enforce
many rules and restrictions which will be binding on all
other companies and persons running trains over their
lines of railway. We shall treat, first, of the common
law obligation, and then of the statutory, as it relates to
companies running trains on their own lines; and after
wards of the provisions and regulations affecting third
parties, whether companies or individuals, putting their
own engines and carriages upon a railway.
A railway company, whether regarded as common car
riers or as carriersof passengers, are bound by the common
law to provide suitable engines for propelling the trains,
and proper carriages, trucks, waggons, vans, horse-boxes,
and other vehicles for the conveyance of persons, horses,
cattle, and goods (a). These must severally be rightly
constructed and kept in sufficient repair, and the com
pany will be liable as well for the consequences of a bad
principle of construction as for dilapidation. Therefore
any accident happening through the improper construc

cHAP. III.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 859
tion of any engine, carriage, or other vehicle, will be attri
buted to negligence on the part of the company, even
though the defect be out of sight and not discoverable on
ordinary examination; (a) for the law requires of them, as
being entrusted with the lives and limbs of their passen
gers, not ordinary care and diligence only, but the utmost
care and diligence of very cautious persons; (b) and, as
common carriers, they are insurers of the goods conveyed
against all injuries except such as arise from the act of
God or the Queen’s enemies (c).
Hence it is the duty of the company not only to have
their carriages properly constructed, but to see that they
are kept in proper and sufficient repair. For this purpose
they are bound to have them examined before each jour
ney, that it may be ascertained whether they are suffi
ciently secure to perform it; and they will be answerable
for the consequences of omitting to do this, even though
there had been an examination previous to the second
journey before the accident, and the vehicle had been very
recently constructed or repaired (d).
These remarks and cases are of the greater importance in
relation to railway companies, inasmuch as actions have
been brought, and damages recovered against them for
the consequences of accidents occurring through some
defect in the engines or carriages which the most cautious
and rigid scrutiny could not have detected; as where
axletrees apparently sound have broken during a journey
from some original latent flaw in the metal, or some defect
produced by their action in the course of being used. It
is not necessary, in an action against a company for negli
gence in the carrying of passengers whereby, through the
breaking down of a carriage, injury was caused to the
plaintiff, in order to prove the negligence to shew that the

defect in the vehicle was one which could have been ob
served by the eye; for if it be shewn that it might have
been detected in any other way, as by striking metal with
a hammer; or that it might have been ascertained on
scientific principles, as in the case of change produced in
the substance of the material by atmospheric influences,
friction, or revolution in a particular manner, and for a
given period, it will be sufficient to fix the company with
liability; the law requiring that all these precautions should
be taken where the lives of individuals are concerned.
Nor is the responsibility of a company in respect of
their engines and carriages confined to those whose persons
and goods are entrusted to them. They are bound so to
construct them as to guard against accidents to the build
ings and property through or near to which the railroad
passes. They must, therefore, take all reasonable precau
tions against the escape of fire and heated cinders from the
furnaces and funnels of their engines; and if through any
negligence in this respect, as for want of a cap to the top
- ofthe funnel,or afire-plate,orfrom not shutting offthe steam
whereby the emission of sparks might be prevented or much
diminished, any houses, stacks, standing corn, or other
things, are set on fire; they will be liable to make compen
sation. And the mere fact of the accident having occurred
by means of a spark from a steam engine, is prima facie
proof of negligence in the owner of it (a).

“every locomotive steam engine to be used on a railway

constructed on the principle of consuming, and so as to
consume its own smoke;” under a penalty of five pounds
per day so long as this regulation shall be disobeyed.

CHAP. III.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 361
Certain legislative restrictions formerly existed as to the
construction of railway carriages, so that no waggon or
carriage could be used on a railway which when loaded
exceeded the weight of four tons. These restrictions
have, however, all been removed by a recent Act of Par
liament (a); and the size, form, and weight, of all the
vehicles to be used are left entirely to the discretion of
the company, who are to regulate them by enacting
and enforcing bye-laws on the subject, to be binding
both on themselves (b) and all other companies and per
sons who would bring engines or carriages upon the
line.
Although it is left to individual companies to deter
mine for themselves, generally, the size and form of their
carriages, yet provisions are made by statute in certain
cases in relation to this subject. The principal of these
relate to carriages for the conveyance of letters and the
convenience of the servants of the Post Office in mail
trains, and to those to be provided for military and police,
and for third class passengers.
On receiving a notice from the Postmaster-General to
that effect, a railway company are required to provide suf
ficient carriages and engines for the conveyance of mails
to the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General (c); and
also to furnish a separate carriage, or carriages, fitted up
as may be required, for the purpose of sorting letters (d).
The company are bound also to appropriate exclusively
any carriage in a mail train to the carrying of letters if so
required (e). On all carriages to be provided for the service
of thePost Office the Royal arms are to be painted,instead of
the name of the owner, and of the number of the carriage,
and of all other requisites (if any) prescribed in respect
of carriages upon the railway; but the want of the Royal

arms will not be an objection to the running of the car
riage (a).
By the 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85, s. 12, it is enacted, that, for
the conveyance of soldiers, marines, and privates of the
militia or police force, their wives, widows, and children,
carriages shall be furnished provided with seats, with suf
ficient space for the reasonable accommodation of the per
sons conveyed, and which shall be protected against the
weather.
By the 6th section of the last mentioned Act, it is pro
vided as to the carriages to be attached to the cheap
trains, which the company are to run daily for the accom
modation of the poorer class of travellers, that they shall
be furnished with seats, and be protected from the wea
ther in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioners of
Railways.
We have already seen (b) that railway companies are
empowered and required to draw up in writing, and under
their common seal, the regulations to be observed by other
companies and persons using the railway, in respect of
carriages brought upon the line. It does not appear, how
ever, that any such regulations need be made as to engines,
the company being left free (subject to the restriction as to
the consuming of smoke) to adopt the size, form, and class
of engine most suitable for their purpose. But all engines
to be brought upon the line by other companies or per
sons are to be subject to the approval of the company.
Thus it is provided by the Railways’ Clauses Act, that no
engine, or other locomotive power, must be brought upon
a railway until it shall have been approved by the com
pany, to whom notice must be given by the party desirous
of bringing it on the line; when, within fourteen days
after the service of such notice, the company are to
appoint an engineer or agent to inspect the same at some
place, to be appointed by the owner, not more than three

miles distant from the railway, and to report thereon to
the company. Within seven days after the making of
this report, if the company approve of the engine, they
are to give a certificate of approval to the party requiring
it, on the receipt of which it may be used on the rail
way (a).
Whenever the engineer or agent of a company reports
that any engine is out of repair or unfit to be used, the
company may require it to be removed, or forbid it to be
used until repaired to their satisfaction, of which a certi
ficate is to be given if required. In case of differences
between the owner of an engine and the company as to
its fitness or unfitness for the purpose of being used, the
matter is to be settled by arbitration (b).
If the owner, or person having the care, of any engine,
or moving power, bring or use the same on the railway
without having first obtained a certificate of the com
pany’s approval as above-mentioned; or if, after notice
given by the company to remove, or not to use any such
engine, such person fail to remove or continues to use it,
without having first repaired it to the satisfaction of the
company, and obtained a certificate to that effect, he is
liable to a penalty of £20., to be recovered by summary
process before two justices. In either of the above cases
of breach of their regulations, the company are also em
powered to remove the engine in question from the rail
way (c).
The provisions contained in the statute under consi
deration respecting carriages are similar to the above,
with this distinction, however, that as to carriages the
company must draw up bye-laws (d) to be binding upon
themselves as well as upon third parties, which in the
case of engines they are not required to do. These bye
laws must be in writing, and be authenticated by the

by the secretary to any person requiring it.
No carriage can be used upon any railway unless it be,
so long as it shall be used, of the construction, and in the
condition, required by the regulations of the company for
the time being; and all disputes between the owners of
such carriages and the company as to their construction
or condition, are to be settled by arbitration (a). If, con
trary to the regulations then in force in respect thereof
any person use a carriage of improper construction or
condition, he will be liable to a penalty of £10 for every
such offence, and the company may remove the carriage
from the line (b).
A company not only have control over all vehicles used
upon the line in respect of the principle of their construc
tion and their state of repair, but also in respect of their
loading. Therefore, if the loading of any carriage using
the railway be such as to be liable to collision with other
carriages properly loaded, or be otherwise dangerous; or
if the person having the care of it, or of the goods, suffer
it or them to remain upon the railway so as to obstruct the
passage or working thereof, the company may cause the
carriage or goods to be unloaded or removed, so as to pre
vent collision or obstruction, and may detain the same
until the expenses of unloading, removal, and detention,
have been paid (c). The company will not be liable for any
but wilful or negligent damage to a carriage or goods so
dealt with; nor be responsible for the safe custody of such
goods or carriage unless wrongfully detained, and then only
during the period of wrongful detention (d).
The owners of carriages using a railway must enter with
the secretary of the company, or other person appointed for
that purpose, the names and places of abode of the owners
of such carriages respectively, with the numbers, weights,
and gauges of their respective carriages; all which parti

culars, if the company so require, are to be painted in
legible characters on the outside of such carriages, so as to
be always open to view. The carriages may also be
weighed, measured, and gauged at the expense of the com
pany (a). On the failure of any party to comply with these
provisions, the company may refuse to allow his carriages
to be brought upon the line, or may remove them from it
until he complies (b).
The owners of engines and carriages using the railway
will be liable for any trespass or damage done by their
engines or carriages, or by their servants, to or upon the
railway, or machinery, or works; or to the property of any
other persons. Any servant or other person so offending
may be convicted of the offence before two justices; and
upon such conviction, the owner of the engine or carriage,
or the employer of the servant, shall pay to the company,
or to the person injured, as the case may be, the amount of
damages to be ascertained by the justices, if it do not ex
ceed the sum of £50 (c); and the owner or employer may

CHAPTER IV.
TRAINS.
THE regulations with regard to the trains on a line of
railway, both as to their number, description, hours of
starting, rate of travelling, and other particulars, are (with
the exceptions mentioned below) to be made by the di
rectors of the company. This power is, however, subject
to some restrictions and exceptions in certain cases; but
such regulations will be binding on all the parties using
the line, provided they are not such as to prevent the pas
sage of trains at all reasonable times. The number and
character of the trains on a railway will generally be
adapted to the public convenience, so as to ensure the
largest amount of remuneration to the proprietors. In
like manner, the speed will be determined by the demands
of passengers and the ability of the company. But it is
provided by 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 48, thatwhen the railway crosses
any turnpike road on a level near a station, no train shall
travel faster than four miles an hour over that crossing.
Although the company are entrusted with the general
control and disposal of their business in the regulation of
trains, yet, in certain instances in which the public inte
rests require it, they are put under statutory obligations
to provide a particular class of trains as prescribed by go
vernment. The principal of these are:—the trains to be
furnished for the conveyance of the mails; for the carriage
of military and police, and the transport of arms and am
munition; and for the accommodation of the poorer class
of travellers at cheap rates. We shall briefly enumerate
the several enactments on these subjects in order.
By the statute 1 & 2 Vic. c. 98, s. 1, it is provided, that
the Postmaster-General may require any railway company
CHAP. Iv.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 367
to furnish conveniences and facilities for the conveyance of (a) Regulations
the mails. For this purpose, he will give a notice to the
directors of the company, requiring them from and after a
day therein named (not being less than twenty-eight days
after the service of the notice), to convey and forward the
mails, or post-letter bags, together with the guards having
charge thereof, and any other officers of the post-office,
either by the ordinary or by special trains, as need may
be, at such hours of the day or night as the Postmaster
General may appoint. This notice will be deemed to have
been duly served on a company when it shall have been
given or delivered to any one or more of the directors of
such company, or to the secretary or clerk of the company,
or shall have been left at any station belonging to the
company.
On the day named in the above notice, the company,
having provided the requisite carriages and engines (a),
must receive and convey all the letter-bags tendered to
them for that purpose, together with the guards and other
officers of the Post Office; and must also receive, deliver,
and leave all such letter-bags, guards, &c. (b), at such
places in the line of the railway, at such hours or times in
the day or night, and subject to all such reasonable regu
lations and restrictions as to speed of travelling, places,
times, and duration of stoppages, and times of departure
and arrival, as the Postmaster-General shall from time to
time direct. They must also provide such proper trucks
for the conveyance of mail coaches, carts, or carriages for
sorting letters, as may be directed (c).
The Postmaster-General may require that the mails be
forwarded at any rate of speed which the Inspector-General
of Railways for the time being shall certify to be safe, not
exceeding twenty-seven miles in the hour, including stop
pages (d).
(a) See supra, p. 361.

The Posmaster-General may also send any mail-guard
with bags not exceeding the weight of luggage allowed to
any other passenger (or subject to the general rules of the
company for any excess of that weight), by any trains other
than a mail train, upon the same conditions as any other
passenger. But in this case the company will not be re
sponsible for the safe custody or delivery of the mail bags
so sent, nor will the train by which they are conveyed be
subject to the regulations made by the Postmaster-General
in respect of regular mail trains. Neither can that officer
require a regular mail train to be converted into an ordi
mary train (a).
For the greater security of the mails, all companies em
ployed in carrying them, with their officers, servants, and
agents, are to obey and observe all such reasonable regu
lations in respect of the conveyance, delivery, and leaving
of such mails, &c., as the Postmaster-General, or any officer
appointed by him for that purpose, may from time to time
make. Nevertheless, no officer of the Post Office can be
permitted to interfere with, or give orders to the engine
driver; but if any cause of complaint arise, it must be
stated to the conductor or other officer of the railway com
pany having the charge of the train, or to the chief officer
at any station on the railway; and the company will be
wholly responsible for any default or neglect on the part
of any of their officers or servants to comply with any of
the regulations of the Postmaster-General (b).
If any bye-laws of the company, made either before or
after the mails shall be conveyed upon the railway, are
repugnant to the regulations issued by the Postmaster
General, or to any of the enactments of the 1 & 2 Vic. c.
98, they are to be deemed absolutely void, and of no effect,
as though they had never been made or passed (c).
If any railway company refuse or neglect to convey
the mails, or to receive, deliver, and leave the letter-bags,

(c) Id. s. 11,

&c., when tendered, according to the directions for that
purpose given, at the places and times therein prescribed;
or to observe and obey the rules and regulations made by
the Postmaster-General, or his appointee; or if any of the
company’s agents or servants make default in any of these
matters, the company shall be liable in every such case to
a penalty of £20, to be enforced by warrant of distress
granted by a justice after summons of the offender, as
prescribed by the 1 Vic. c. 36, s. 13(a). This penalty
will be in addition to that to which the company may be
liable under the bond hereinafter mentioned (b).
The remuneration to be paid to the company for the
conveyance of the mails is to be settled by agreement with
the Postmaster-General, made either before or after the
commencement of the company’s service, which is not to
be suspended or postponed until the agreement shall be
concluded (c).
In every case where the amount of compensation payable
by the Postmaster-General to the company, for services
rendered, or otherwise, is disputed, the matter is to be re
ferred to two arbitrators, one to be nominated by each
party; and, if they cannot agree, them to an umpire (to be
appointed by the arbitrators before entering on the inquiry),
whose award (or that of the arbitrators) will be binding
and conclusive on the parties, their successors and as
signs (d). On default of either party to name an arbi
trator for fourteen days after notice, the arbitrator of the
other party may nominate a second, and both may proceed
in the reference. If they do not make their award within
twenty-eight days after their appointment, the matter must
be left to the decision of the umpire; and if he fail to de
cide the question within twenty-eight days after his ap
pointment, the arbitrators are to nominate another umpire,
on whose neglect in like manner to make an award within
the period limited, a third umpire must be named; and

so “toties quoties,” until a decision of the matter is ob
tained (a).
When any agreement has been entered into between a
railway company and the Postmaster-General, or an
award made, as to the amount of remuneration to be paid
to the company for their services to the Post Office, such
agreement or award will not prevent the Postmaster
General (on giving a notice to that effect to the company)
from requiring of them from and after a certain day (not
being earlier than twenty-eight days after the service of
notice) additional services beyond those in respect of
which the agreement or award has been made; and there
upon (and also in case of a discontinuance of any service
theretofore rendered) a new agreement is to be made by
the parties as to the amount of remuneration to be paid
and received for such increased (or diminished) services.
The alteration (or suspension) of the services is not, how
ever, to be postponed, although the terms of this agree
ment cannot be settled (b). So the Postmaster-General
may terminate the services (or any part thereof) of the
company, by giving them six months’ notice in writing
under his hand to that effect; and upon the expiration of
that period the services comprised in the notice, and the
remuneration therefor, shall cease. So without giving
any notice, or on the giving of a shorter notice, an end
may be put to the services or any of them. In either of
these latter cases, however, when the services of the com
pany shall have been determined without any cause what
ever, or for any other cause than the default of the com
pany in their performance, or breach of any of their
engagements with the Postmaster-General, then the latter
must make to the company full and fair compensation for
all loss thereby occasioned (c). Not only may the terms
of an original agreement between the Post Office authori
ties and a railway company be submitted to arbitration;

but also those of any substituted agreement in the case
of the alteration, suspension, or determination of their ser
vices, and the amount of compensation to which they may
be entitled for loss occasioned by the sudden termina
nation of their engagements with the Postmaster
General (a).
And even in case of a contract, the terms of which have
been settled by arbitration, and no subsequent alteration
has been made in the nature and amount of the services
required and rendered, the company may, if they feel
themselves aggrieved in respect of the amount of remu
neration therein fixed, after it has been in force for a period
of three years, by notice under their common seal to the
Postmaster-General, require that it be referred to arbi
trators, to determine (as in other cases) whether any and
what alteration should be made therein; the services of the
company under it, in the meanwhile, not being interrupted
or suspended (b).
The Postmaster-General may require the company to
give security for the due performance of the services con
tracted for, and obedience to the regulations made. For
this purpose they are to give a bond (to be renewed when
forfeited, or as often as required) to her Majesty, her heirs
and successors, in such terms as the Postmaster-General
may name, conditioned to be void on the due fulfilment
(c) Security.
of the agreement between the parties. For any neglect or
refusal on the part of the company for one month to enter
into, or renew, this bond, they will be liable to a penalty of
one hundred pounds, for every day of such neglect or
refusal after the expiration of the said one month; to be
recovered by action in any of the superior courts, if sued
for within one year after the penalty has been incurred.

corporate or a company) to give security as above required
to any amount exceeding a thousand pounds; nor to
be liable in any one year to have damages recovered against
them on any such bond, to a greater amount than one
thousand pounds and costs of suit (a).
Where persons are required to give security by bond to
the Post Office, they may, with the consent of any three of
the Lords of the Treasury, transfer to, or deposit with the
Postmaster-General, stock or exchequer bills, for such
an amount as, in the judgment of such lords, shall be a
sufficient security against breach of the duty for the per
formance of which such security is required (b).
By the 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85, s. 12, amending the 5 & 6 Vic.
c. 55, s. 20, provisions are made for the conveyance of any
of her Majesty’s forces of the line, ordnance-corps, marines,
militia, or the police force, by railway. These provisions
apply to every company incorporated after the passing of
the Act (c). And also, as far as regards the providing of
cheap trains (d), to every company which although pre
viously incorporated, has since obtained any extension or
amendment of the power before conferred. The Act pre
scribes the fares and charges to be made by the com
pany (e), and which are not to exceed twopence per mile
for each commissioned officer proceeding on duty, such
officer being entitled to conveyance in a first-class car
riage; and not exceeding one penny per mile for each
soldier, marine, or private of the militia or police force,
and also for each wife, widow, or child above twelve years

Each officer conveyed is to be entitled to take with him
one hundred weight of personal luggage without extra
charge, and every soldier, marine, private, wife or widow,
may take with him or her half a hundred weight of per
sonal luggage without extra charge, all excess over the
above weights being charged for at the rate of not more
than one halfpenny per pound per mile.
All public baggage, stores, arms, ammunition, and other
necessaries and things, (except gunpowder and other
combustibles,) must be conveyed at charges not exceeding
twopence per ton per mile; the assistance of the military
or other forces being given in loading and unloading such
goods.
The company are only bound to convey gunpowder
and other combustible matters at such prices and upon
such conditions as shall be from time to time contracted
for between the Secretary at War and themselves (a).
By the Act abovementioned, provision is made for the

CHAPTER V.
TOLLs, RATES, AND CHARGEs.
WE propose in this chapter to treat of the law as it relates
to the amount of remuneration to be charged and received
by a railway company, whether for privileges afforded by
them to the public as owners and proprietors of the line, or
for services rendered as carriers of goods and passengers
over it. In the several Acts of Parliament relating to the sub
ject (whether general or special), the terms “toll,” “rate,”
“charge,” appear to be used almost interchangeably, or,
at least without any distinct and definite appropriateness.
Nevertheless, the first, in strict legal signification, would
seem to apply only to the sum to be demanded and taken
by a company for the liberty granted by them as owners
of the railroad to a third party to pass along and use it
with his own engines, carriages, and trucks; and which is
identical with that taken by canal proprietors for the use
of the navigation; and analogous to that paid on a turn
pike road for the use thereof to the trustees.
The words “rate,” “charge,” are not distinguishable
in meaning, but both relate to the monies payable to
and receivable by the company as carriers of goods and
passengers in their own carriages, propelled by their own
engines, and over their own line, or the lines of other
companies with whom they have contracted for that pur
pose. For convenience sake we shall endeavour to pre
serve throughout this chapter the distinction above alluded
to, considering the word tolls to refer exclusively to the
remuneration paid to a company as owners of the line for
its user, and rates and charges to refer to their remunera
tion as carriers of persons and goods on it on their
own account. The rights and remedies, and both the
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 877
common law and statutory obligations of the company,
and of third parties, differ very materially in the two
cases, and they must, therefore, be treated separately.
Nevertheless there are certain general principles and pro
visions which apply alike to both, and the consideration of
which may, therefore, well precede any reference to those
matters which belong exclusively to either.
These topics of general application to the subject of this
chapter comprise (as of chief importance) the following:—
the right to take tolls and charges, with the construction
put upon it in Courts of Law and Equity; the right to
vary such tolls and charges, with the limits within which,
and the conditions under which, such variation may be
made; the necessity of making and maintaining all such
tolls and charges both reasonable and equal; and, lastly,
the obligation of the company to make periodical and
accurate returns of them to the Commissioners of Rail
ways; and the right of the latter to revise and alter the
scale thereof, under certain circumstances, and at fixed
times.
SEC. I.—General Legal Principles and Provisions in
relation to Tolls, Rates, and Charges.
THE right of a railway company to take tolls for the user of
the line arises under their Special Act, and is recognised
in the 92d section of the Railways’ Clauses Act (a), which
provides, “that upon payment of the tolls from time to
time demandable, all companies and persons shall be en
titled to use the railway.” The Special Act usually fixes
the maximum of all such tolls and charges.
Their right to constitute themselves common carriers,
and to make charges for the conveyance of goods and pas

sengers is also given by their Act of Incorporation, taken
in connection with the provisions of the above statute,
which, in the 86th section, empowers them to employ
locomotive engines or other moving power, together with
carriages and waggons, and to convey passengers and
goods upon the line, and to make therefor such reasonable
charges as may be determined on, not exceeding those by
the Special Act authorised to be taken.
With respect to the right of a public company to take
a toll under the powers of their Act, it has been decided
that the empowering clauses of the statute are to be con
sidered as the terms of a bargain between the company
and the public, and any ambiguity in them must, there
fore, according to the usual rule of construction, operate
against the company and in favour of the public. The
right to take tolls, as it arises exclusively under the Act, is
to be limited strictly to the terms of it, and nothing can
be claimed which is not clearly given thereby. This rule
is well illustrated in the following case. A canal was
formed upon two levels which were connected by a chain
of locks. Upon the upper level there was no lock what
ever. By the Act of Parliament for making the canal, all
persons were at liberty to navigate thereupon with boats,
upon payment of such rates and dues as should be de
manded by the company, not exceeding the rates therein
mentioned; and by another clause the company were
authorised to take certain rates and duties for every ton
of iron and other goods navigated on any part of the
canal, and which should pass through any one or more of
the locks; and power was given to the owners of adjoin
ing lands to use pleasure boats on the canal without pay
ing dues, so as the same did not pass through any lock,
and were not used for carrying goods. It was held that
this Act gave no right to demand toll for boats navi
gating the upper level of the canal in which there were no
locks (a).
(a) Stourbridge Canal Com. v. Wheeley, 2 B. & Ad. 793.
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 379
In addition to the rule above mentioned that Special
Acts are to be construed as bargains between the adven
turers and the public, and ambiguity in the terms of the con
tract must operate against the adventurers and in favour of
the public, itis a general principle to be adopted in the con
struction of statutes, that no tax should be considered as
imposed unless the language is clear and unambiguous,
especially in the case of Private Acts where that tax is for
the benefit of private individuals or companies (a).
A railway company may vary the tolls upon the railway
with the view of accommodating them to the circum
stances of the traffic, so that the variation be not made
collusively, or for the purpose of prejudicing any particu
lar parties, or unfairly creating a monopoly; or so as in
any case to exceed the maximum rate of charges pre
scribed by the Special Act. Thus they have the power of
varying the rate of tolls by the Special Act authorised to be
taken, either upon the whole, or any particular portions of
the railway as they shall think fit; provided that all such
tolls be at all times charged equally to all persons, and after
the same rate per ton per mile, or otherwise, in respect of
all passengers, and of all goods or carriages of the same de
scription, and conveyed or propelled by a like carriage or
engine; passing only over the same portion of the line of
railway, under the same circumstances; and no reduction
or advance in any such tolls is to be made, either directly
or indirectly, in favour of, or against, any particular com
pany or person travelling upon or using the railway. (b)
Both the original and the altered scale of tolls and
rates imposed on the public by a railway company must

be reasonable and equal. As to what are to be deemed
reasonable and equal charges, the case of Parker v. Great
Western Railway Company (a) may furnish some informa
tion. The company were empowered under their several
Acts to make certain reasonable charges, and to vary the
scale within certain limits, so that such variations should
be equal and impartial. The company constituted them
selves common carriers, charging the public at the rates
specified in their printed bills for carriage of goods; such
charges including the collection, weighing, loading, un
loading, and delivery of the goods. They also carried
goods for other carriers, allowing them a certain deduc
ion for the trouble of collecting, &c., which was per
formed by the carriers. In their dealings with a particu
lar carrier they refused to make such allowance, but were
willing to perform for him all the things which formed
the consideration of that allowance, and which in fact he
performed for himself. It was held, that the company
were not justified in withholding the allowance from such
carrier, and, therefore, that the charges to him without
that deduction were not equal or reasonable.
It further appeared, that the company made the follow
ing distinction as to their charges for carriage, in their
dealings with the public and with carriers. In the case
of the public, if there were several packages from one
consignor to several consignees, or vice versá, the charge
was made upon the aggregate weight: in the case of car
riers, if there were several packages consigned by or to
different individuals, the charge was upon the separate
weight of each package, unless it was known that more
than one package belonged to the same consignor, or was
going to the same consignee, in which case they were
charged on the aggregate weight. In all cases of carriers
the company dealt with and recognised the carrier only
as their consignor and consignee of the goods: it was
(a) 7 Sc. N. R. 835, 3 Rail. Ca. 563.
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 381
held, that they were bound to treat them so for all pur
poses, including the mode of charging them in the aggre
gate, and had no right to make a distinction in that
respect between them and individuals.
So also, in the case of Pickford v. The Grand Junction
Railway Company (a), the question of reasonableness and
equality of charges came before the Court; and it was
decided that where the company in their list of rates im
posed a charge of one penny per pound weight “for boxes,
bales, hampers, or other packages, when they contained
parcels or other packages or things under one hundred and
twelve pounds weight each, directed, consigned, or intended
for different persons, or for more than one person,” that
such a charge was not reasonable in the case of a package
of above five hundred pounds weight, made up by a car
rier, and directed to one person, although containing a
number of parcels under one hundred and twelve pounds
weight each, directed or consigned to different persons.
So where the company became carriers on another line,
and published a list of rates, to which was appended a
notice that goods were brought to their terminus without
extra charge, and that there was no charge for booking, or
delivering in L.; and they made a contract with certain
parties, that the latter should carry from their terminus,
and deliver in L. all goods brought by the railway, receiv
ing therefor a certain per centage or proportion of the
whole charge to the customer; it was held that the whole
charge could not be imposed on persons ready to receive
their goods at the terminus, and that it was in their case
both unreasonable and unequal (b).
It appears from the above, that the Courts will watch
the proceedings of railway companies with great jealousy,
to see that they do not abuse their large powers for the
purposes of oppression, and with a view to establish any
unfair monopoly. Most of the disputes on the subject
(a) 10 M. & W. 399; 3 Rail. Ca. 538. (b) Ibid.
382 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book IV.
under consideration which have led to litigation, have
arisen between such companies and common carriers, and
seem to have originated from attempts on the part of the
former to obtain a complete monopoly of the carrying trade,
to the utter exclusion of private persons and firms. The
language of the statutes, general and special, and the firm
ness of the Courts have, however, been too strong for the
companies making these illegal attempts; and it is not
easy to see how the latter can evade the law thus clearly
expressed, fairly interpreted, and justly administered, so as
to inflict upon the public those crying evils of monopoly
against which all these precautions have been taken. In
one case, in the Court of Chancery (a), a doubt was ex
pressed whether a company, being carriers only to Birming
ham, could legally make the same charge to A. for deli
very of goods at Birmingham as they make to B. for deli
very of goods at Worcester; B. agreeing to give the com
pany his whole custom, and agreeing to pay on certain
articles an increased price; and, inasmuch as such an ar
rangement for charges, unequal as between one party and
another, seems to be an infraction of the terms of the rail
way Acts, no less than an invasion of their spirit, it would
most probably in a court of law be held illegal and void.
Although the Courts are jealous in the exercise of their
jurisdiction over companies armed with parliamentary
powers, to maintain the public rights, and restrict a com
pany to the limits prescribed by their Act, yet they will not
interfere summarily in a doubtful case. It will depend,
therefore, upon the facts and circumstances disclosed on
the application whether an injunction will be granted to
restrain a company from making certain charges alleged
to be unfair, or whether the complainant will be left to
establish their illegality in an action at law. Thus, in a
case where the company gave an option to a party sending
packages containing small parcels to pay according to an
(a) Pickford and Another v. Grand Junction Rail. Com. 3 R.C. 538.
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 383
average, or to pay for the parcels separately, it was held
that if the principle of an average were legal, and the
amount of it reasonable, although the alternative requiring
the party to pay for the separate parcels may be per se
illegal, yet that that would not render the demand to pay
according to average illegal; and an injunction to restrain
the company from making such charges was refused (a).
But if the rate of tolls exacted by a railway company be
not equal, and in accordance with the terms of their Act,
and they refuse to make them so, a mandamus will be
granted to compel them (b). But no mandamus will be
granted, nor will the Court of Chancery interfere by in
junction, except in cases in which there is a clear evasion
or infringement of the Act, and when the public interests
are thereby affected. And although tolls and charges are
to be equal, yet this equality is not always to be deter
mined by an arithmetical computation; for it would seem
that a passenger for a short distance may legally be charged
more per mile than one for a longer distance (c).
If any tolls be taken by a company exceeding the rate
specified in the Special Act as the maximum to be charged,
the party who has paid it may recover back the over
charge in an action for money had and received (d).
To protect the public from the serious evils of monopoly
in the conveyance of goods and passengers, and to secure
to them the privilege of travelling, or transporting goods,
on fair and reasonable terms, the scale of charges imposed
by railway companies is liable, in certain events and at
certain times, to be revised by the government. Thus,

by the statute 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85, s. 1, it is provided, with
respect to all railways authorised by any Act of that or
any succeeding session, that if at any time after the end of
twenty-one years from the 1st of January next after the
passing of any Act authorising the construction of a pas
senger railway, the clear amount of profits divisible upon
the subscribed and paid up capital stock of the said rail
way, upon the average of the then three last preceding
years, shall be ten per cent, or more, then the Commis-.
sioners of Railways, on giving three months’ motice to the
company, may revise the scale of tolls to such an extent as,
supposing the same quantities and kinds of traffic to con
tinue, shall in their judgment be likely to reduce the divi
sible profits to ten per cent. This revised scale is to be
accompanied by a guarantee that the divisible profits, if
any deficiency occur, are to be made good to the amount
of ten per cent.; nor can the scale be again revised for
twenty-one years, unless with the consent of the company.
Any railway on which one third or more of the gross
annual revenue shall be derived from the carriage of pas
sengers, will be a passengers’ railway, within the meaning
of the statute under consideration (a). The companies
subject to the above provisions are for the three years next
preceding the period of revision, to deliver half-yearly to
the Commissioners of Railways accurate abstracts of the
receipt and expenditure on their several lines, duly audited
and certified by two directors, and to permit the inspection
of their books by any persons to be appointed by the com
missioners to test the accuracy of the original returns (b).
These provisions will be found practically to apply to
almost every railway company in existence, although in
corporated before the passing of the Act in which they are
contained, because there is scarcely any company which has
not been compelled to make subsequent application to
Parliament for enlarged and amended powers, which they

have secured on condition oftheir becoming subject to the
regulations of the recited statute.
If the company object to the revision of their scale of
charges, they may have the option of selling the railway to
government for a sum equal to twenty-five years’ purchase.
But the option of revision or purchase cannot in any case
be exercised by the government, until an Act has been
passed authorising the guarantee above mentioned, or the
levy of the purchase money (as the case may be), and de
termining the manner in which the options shall be exer
cised. Three months’ notice of an intention to apply for
such an Act must be given to the company affected by it,
and the giving of the notice must be recited in the pre
amble of the bill. (a)

as Owners and Proprietors of the Line.
BEFoRE a railway company are entitled to demand or
take any tolls for the use of a railway, a list of all such
tolls authorised by their Special Act to be taken, and
which shall be exacted by the company, must be published
by the same being painted upon one toll board or more
in distinct black letters on a white ground, or white letters
on a black ground; or by being printed in legible cha
racters on paper affixed to such board. The board must
be exhibited in some conspicuous place at the stations,
where the tolls are made payable, and such tolls can be
taken only during the time that this provision is ob
served (b). -
The company are also bound to have the length of the
railway measured, and at the distance of a quarter of a
mile from each other, to have milestones, posts, or other
conspicuous objects set up and maintained along the whole

line, with numbers or marks inscribed thereon, denoting
the distances, and no tolls can be demanded until this has
been done (a).
It is not lawful for a company at any time to demand
or take a greater amount of toll than they are by the
Railways’ Clauses Act and their Special Act, authorised
to demand. We have already seen that the maximum
tolls are fixed by the statute incorporating the company,
and that no variation of the scale can be made so as to
exceed in any case that maximum. Generally, therefore,
the amount of tolls demandable will follow the rates as
settled by the company under their powers, and exhibited
on toll boards at the stations.
So although a company may enter into a contract with
any other company for the passage of trains and the car
riage of goods and passengers over their line, or for the
passage of their own trains and the conveyance of their
own passengers and goods along the line of another rail
way, and may thereupon make such arrangements as to
them may seem expedient for the apportionment of the tolls,
yet no such arrangement can avail in any degree to alter
or affect the amount of the tolls which the respective com
panies are for the time being authorised to charge other
persons and companies, but the latter will still be entitled
to use the railways on the same terms and conditions, and
upon payment of the same rate of tolls as before (b).
Again, in many Railway Acts it is provided that the
company may charge for the conveyance of passengers
and goods over the fraction of a mile, the same toll which
they are entitled to demand for a mile; in cases, there
fore, in which any railway shall be amalgamated with any
adjoining railway or railways, the tolls must be calculated
and imposed at such rates as if such amalgamated lines
had originally formed one line of railway (c).
The tolls are to be paid to such persons, and at such

places near to the railway as the company may appoint.
Notice ofthe regulations as to the mode and places of pay
ment must be affixed to the lists of tolls (a). They must
also be paid before the parties will be entitled to use the
railway (b), if demanded by the proper officer.
If on demand any person refuse or neglect to pay the
tolls due for any carriage or goods, the company may
detain and sell them, or if they have been removed from
the premises of the company, then they may detain and
sell any other carriages or goods remaining on their pre
mises belonging to the parties in default, and out of the
monies arising from the sale may reimburse themselves for
the costs of the detention and sale, and also retain there
out the amount of tolls due, paying over the balance to the
parties entitled to it. Or the company may, if they prefer
it, recover the tolls by action at law (c). -
An important question may arise under the above pro
vision, as to the nature and extent of the lien therein
conferred on railway companies; whether it extends to a
general balance, or is limited to the tolls due, in respect
of any particular carriage train or goods. The words of
the section seem to be sufficiently comprehensive to
empower a company to seize, detain, and sell any carriages
or goods on their premises belonging to their debtor for
arrears of tolls generally. This question is of considerable
importance where common carriers use the railway with
their own engines and carriages; and the goods of their
customers may become liable to be seized to pay a balance
due from them to the company. The fact of the goods
belonging to third parties makes no difference in such a
case, the carrier being deemed, so far as the company are
concerned, the sole owner of them.
So where the owners of minerals are in the habit of
sending them by railway, disputes as to the extent of the
company’s lien may frequently occur. And in cases of

bankruptcy, it will often be material to examine the
question, with a reference to the interest of the creditors,
whether the right claimed extends farther than for the
tolls of that particular day or train, leaving the company
to bring an action at law, for any arrears which may be
due. On the whole it would seem to have been the inten
tion of the legislature to grant to a railway company a
lien on property in their hands for a general balance due
from their debtor ; and as the language of the section on
this subject in the Railways’ Clauses Act, is large enough
to give it, we conclude that the company would be held
entitled not only to seize and sell one carriage and its
lading for the tolls due for the whole train, but to sell the
whole or any part of such train to liquidate the amount
of any balance due from the owner to the company for
arrears of toll. -
The collector of tolls on the railway is entitled to de
mand, and the owner or person having charge of any car
riage or goods passing or being on the railway, is bound
to render a true and exact account in writing, signed by
him, of the number or quantity of goods, conveyed by such
carriage, with the distance which they are to travel; and
specify the amount of the different classes of goods which
may be liable to different tolls.
Any person refusing or neglecting to make these returns
or rendering a false account, or refusing to produce his
way bill or bill of lading, or unloading any portion of his
goods at a place other than that mentioned in his account,
with intent to defraud the company of tolls, is liable for
every such offence to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds
for every ton of goods, or for any parcel not exceeding
one hundred weight, and so on in proportion for any less
quantity of goods than one ton, or for any parcel exceeding
one hundred weight which may be upon the carriage.
This penalty is in addition to the amount of tolls to which
the goods may be liable.
In cases of dispute respecting the amount of the tolls
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 389
due to the company or concerning the charges occasioned
by any detention or sale of goods as above mentioned, the
matter is to be referred to a justice, whose decision
shall be final. Pending his decision, the company may
detain the goods or the proceeds of the sale, as the case
may be.
If any difference arise between any toll collector and
any owner or person having the charge of goods on the
railway, as to the weight, quantity, quality, or nature of
such goods, the former may detain the goods, and examine,
weigh, gauge, or otherwise measure the same; and if on
examination it shall turn out that there has been any
misrepresentation in respect of the goods, the owner shall
pay the costs of the examination, but if they are found
correct, or of less quantity than mentioned in the account,
the company shall bear the charges incident to the exami
nation, and shall also pay to the owner of the carriage or
goods such damages for detention as shall appear to a
justice, on a summary application for that purpose, to be
sufficient.
If on complaint by the company before a justice, it
shall at any time appear that a toll collector has detained,
examined, or measured any carriage or goods vexatiously,
and without reasonable grounds, the latter will be liable
instead of the company, to all the costs and damages of
such detention, which (if he fail to pay them immediately)
may be recovered by distress on a warrant issued by the
justice.

carriers of goods and passengers on their own account.
The right to the former arises exclusively under the
statutes general and special relating to the company;
but in regard to the latter, whilst the company acquire
powers under the Act to use the line with their own
engines and carriages, and carry persons and goods, yet
their claim for remuneration for these services arises at
common-law, although the amount to be demanded and
received is limited in their Special Act.
We have already seen (a) that when a railway company
undertake the conveyance of goods, wares, and merchan
dise, for hire, over their own or other lines of railway,
they make themselves common carriers, and all the legal
incidents of the position of that class at once attach to
them, varied however, by special Statutory provisions in
certain cases. Hence the common law rules relating to
charges for conveyance of goods, apply (except so far as
they are qualified as above) as well to railway companies
as to individual and ordinary carriers. Therefore the
former are entitled in all cases to demand the price or
hire of carriage before they receive the goods, and if it is
not paid they may refuse to take charge of them. If,
however, they take charge of them without the hire being
paid, they may afterwards recover it (b). So they will be
entitled to a lien on the goods for their hire, and may
detain them until it is paid, unless they have entered into
some special contract by which it is waived. A delivery
of the goods will defeat the lien; and if once waived it
cannot afterwards be resumed (c).
The rates and charges for conveyance of goods must not
exceed the maximum fixed by the company’s Special Act;
nor must they be unreasonable or unequal. Subject to
these restrictions the scale is fixed by the directors, and

varied from time to time so as to suit the circumstances
of the traffic and the purposes of the company. These
restrictions apply to the company in their capacity as
common carriers, and are of force only so long as they
carry goods in the ordinary course of their trade as such;
nor will they apply to cases in which special contracts are
entered into. Although, therefore, a maximum rate of
charge is fixed by the Special Act, yet that section is
usually accompanied with a proviso to the effect, that it
shall not apply to any case in which the company are re
quired to carry the goods at a greater than the ordi
nary rate of speed, or with a less load than the full load of
the engine employed, or by a passenger train: and that it
shall not prevent the company from taking any increased
charges for the conveyance of goods by agreement with
the owners for any special service in relation thereto.
In certain cases, moreover, these rates are by statute
required to be made, the subject of agreement or arbi
tration between the officers of government, or certain pub
lic departments, and the company; as in the conveyance of
mails, for which the Postmaster-General will contract; (a)
or of gunpowder, and other combustible matters, for which
the secretary-at-war will contract; (b) or they are abso
lutely fixed by the legislature, as in case of military and
public baggage, stores, arms, and ammunition, for which
twopence per ton per mile only can be charged (c).
The rate of charges allowed to be taken for the convey
ance of military, marines, and police, is fixed at one penny
per mile for an adult; their children under three years of
age being taken free; and those between the ages of three
and twelve years at half-price. Officers are to be charged
not exceeding twopence a mile (d).
In cheap trains, to be provided in compliance with
the Act of Parliament, the passengers are to be charged

at a rate not exceeding one penny per mile (e). As to
all other passengers the scale of charges may be arranged,
and altered as in the case of goods, subject only to the
restrictions and limitations of the Special Act, and the
general Railway Acts. But whilst the Act of Incorporation
always fixes the maximum rate for passengers, it is usually
provided that the restriction shall not apply in the case
of any special or extra train which may be required, but
only to the ordinary trains appointed to run for the con
veyance of passengers and goods. For such special trains,
therefore, an agreement must be made with the company
in each individual case, nor does it appear that they are
bound to charge all parties alike for a similar amount of
accommodation, but are at liberty to make the best bar
gain they can under the circumstances. In practice there
is, however, on most lines of railway, a fixed rate of charge
for a special train, determined with reference to the num
ber of travellers and the distance to be travelled, modified
in some cases by the time of day or night at which the
accommodation is afforded.
Penalty on Any passenger practising a fraud on the company by
passenger for - • • - -
fraud. travelling without paying the fare, or going a greater dis
tance than that for which he has paid, will be liable to a
penalty of forty shillings, and may be detained by any
officer of the company, or any peace officer, until he can
be conveniently taken before a justice, or otherwise dis
charged in the due course of law.
No provision seems to be made in the above sections
(103, 104), for inflicting a penalty on any person travelling
in a carriage of a superior class to that for which he has
paid, unless such a case may be considered as included in
the words, “If any person travel or attempt to travel in
any carriage of the company, or of any other company or
party using the railway, without having previously paid his
fare,” &c. In all probability, the case we have mentioned
(a) 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85. s. 6.
CHAP. v.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 393
would be deemed to fall within the scope of the enactment,
and the party offending would be held liable to the penalty
imposed by the section.
For the convenience and security of the company in
the management of their business, many regulations are
made as to the payment of fares, and the exhibition and
production of the tickets to the proper officer; for breach
of which penalties are exacted under the bye-laws of the
company. All these, unless repugnant to the law of the
land, may be enforced. One rule, however, frequently
embodied in a company’s code, is fairly open to question.
It is provided by many companies that, if a passenger
fail to produce his ticket at the proper time and place, he
shall be liable to pay the fare for the whole distance which
the train in which he is seated has travelled, without re
ference to the place at which he may have entered it.
This point has been recently raised, and decided in the
Court of Exchequer (a), and it was held that such a bye
law was unreasonable, and repugnant to the common law,
and therefore void.

CHAPTER VI.
BYE-LAWS.
RAILwAY companies are empowered to make bye-laws of
two classes—those which regulate the conduct of their own
servants, and those which regulate the user of the railway
by the public. We shall first treat of those relating to
their own servants, then of those relating to the public.
The perfect regularity and good order of a railway esta
blishment is so essential to the safety and comfort of the
public, that power to make bye-laws for the management
and control of the officers and servants of the company is
always conferred on the directors. This authority is now
given by the 124th and following sections of the Companies'
Clauses Act (a). The bye-laws so made must not be repug
nant to the general law of the land, nor to the provisions
of the Special or General Railway Acts. Reasonable
penalties, not exceeding £5 for any one offence, may be
imposed upon any officer or servant of the company for
the breach of them; but they must be so framed as to
allow the justice before whom the penalty is sought to be
recovered to order a part only of such penalty to be paid,
if he shall think fit (b). These bye-laws will be of no effect
until they have been reduced into writing, and had the
common seal of the company affixed to them. A copy of
them must be given to every officer and servant of the
company affected thereby (c). The production of a written
or printed copy of the bye-laws of the company, having
the common seal of the company affixed thereto, will be
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16. (b) Id. ss. 125, 126.
(c) Id. s. 124.
cHAP. VI.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 395
sufficient evidence of the same in all cases of prosecution
under them (a).
The directors of a company have power to appoint
every member of the staff established for working the line,
as superintendents, conductors, toll collectors, engine dri
vers, guards, porters, and other servants. They have
power also to dismiss them or any of them for any neg
lect of duty, breach of orders, incapacity, or negligence,
and to make such bye-laws for regulating their conduct
as may be deemed expedient.
But inasmuch as the consequences of any negligence or
breach of duty on the part of the persons employed by a
railway company are frequently of the most serious kind,
the company, in addition to the power of dismissal and the
right of enforcing penalties before a justice of the peace
for the misconduct of their servants, are authorized to ap
prehend and detain any of their officers and servants
so offending. Hence any railway servant guilty of mis
conduct, may be seized, and detained by any officer or
agent of the company, or by any special constable.
Therefore if any engine driver, waggon driver, guard,
porter, servant, or other persons employed by the
railway company, or by any other company, or per
son, in conducting traffic upon the railway, or in re
pairing the works, be found drunk while so employed,
or shall commit any offence against any of the bye-laws
of the company, or shall wilfully or maliciously do or
omit to do any act whereby the life or limb of any person
upon the railway might be injured or endangered, or
whereby the passage of any engines, carriages or trains
might be obstructed; he may be taken with all convenient
speed before a magistrate without any warrant, and upon
conviction of the offence may be imprisoned with or
without hard labour for any term not exceeding two
calendar months, or may be fined £10, on non-payment

of which he may be imprisoned for two months, if the
penalty be not sooner paid (a).
If the magistrate think it right, he may, instead of sum
marily convicting the party charged, commit him for trial
at the Quarter Sessions, and either send him to prison,
or admit him to bail at his discretion. On being convicted
at the sessions, the offender may be imprisoned with or
without hard labour for any period not exceeding two
years. It does not appear that the Court of Quarter
Sessions have any discretion to impose a fine in such
case, and therefore a person tried at the sessions for an
offence under the above provisions must be punished by
imprisonment as the Court may direct (b).
No appeal is given to the Court of Quarter Sessions
from the decision of a single magistrate, in respect of any
penalty or punishment inflicted summarily under the sec
tions of the statutes above cited; but where a penalty is
imposed by any bye-law under the 8 Vic, c. 16, it would
appear that any party aggrieved by the adjudication of a
justice may enter such appeal at any time within four ca
lendar months after the adjudication of which he com
plains (c).
The distinction would seem to be, that where the offence
charged involves public convenience or public safety no
appeal is allowed, but where it consists only of a breach of
some bye-law made for the internal management of the
company the conviction may be reviewed.
Formerly it was usual in every Special Railway Act to em
power the company to make bye-laws for the regulation of
the user of the railway, subject to certain specified restric
tions, and subject also to the provisions of the Public General
Acts, relating to railways. Instead, however, of intro
ducing a clause giving this power into the Special Act,
the authority is now conferred on the company by the
(a) 3 & 4 Vic. c. 97, s. 13, extended by 5 & 6 Wic. c. 55, s. 17.
(b) 3 & 4 Vic. c. 97, s. 14.
(c) 8 Vic, c. 16, s. 159.
CHAP. VI, WORKING OF THE LINE. 397
Railways’ Clauses Consolidation Act, which provides (a)
with respect to the regulating of the user of the Railway
that, “It shall be lawful for the company from time to
time, subject to the provisions and restrictions in this and
the Special Act contained, to make regulations for the
following purpose (that is to say)—
For regulating the mode by which and the speed at
which carriages using the railway are to be moved or
propelled.
For regulating the time of the arrival and departure of
any such carriages.
For regulating the loading or unloading of such car
riages, and the weights which they are respectively to
carry.
For regulating the receipt and delivery of goods and
other things which are to be conveyed upon such car
riages.
For preventing the smoking of tobacco, and the com
mission of any other nuisance, in or upon such carriages,
or in any of the stations or premises occupied by the
company.
And, generally, for regulating the travelling upon, or
using, or working the railway.
But no such regulation shall authorise the closing of
the railway, or prevent the passage of engines or carriages
on the railway at reasonable times, except at any time
when in consequence of any of the works being out of
repair, or from any other sufficient cause, it shall be neces
sary to close the railway or any part thereof.”
The next section of the same statute empowers the com
pany to secure the observance of the above regulations,
by making bye-laws under the common seal of the com
pany, inflicting a penalty not exceeding £5 on any offender,
which may be altered and repealed as circumstances may
require. In the exercise of this power to make bye-laws,
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 108.
398 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book V.
Effect of.
Proof of.
it must be observed that such bye-laws must none of
them be repugnant to the enactments of the Stat. 1 & 2
Vic. c. 98, whether they were made before or after the
time when the railway shall have come under the operation
of that Act. So it is provided by the 3 & 4 Wic. c. 97,
ss. 7 to 9, that all bye-laws made before the passing
thereof, are to be submitted to the Commissioners of Rail
ways for their approval, without which they are to be
deemed nugatory and void; and with respect to bye-laws
and regulations made after the passing of the Act, they
are to be of no effect until approved of by the said com
missioners, who may at any time, by giving notice to the
company, annul and disallow any rule at that time in force.
Moreover, all bye-laws regulating the use of the railway
must be painted on boards or printed on paper, and
pasted on boards, and affixed on the front of every wharf
and station belonging to the company, according to the
subject matter of the bye-laws respectively, and so as to
give public notice of them to the parties interested therein
and affected thereby; and no penalty can be enforced
under them unless such publication has been made and
maintained (a). And, lastly, these bye-laws must be rea
sonable, and not in any way repugnant to the general law
of the land.
The bye-laws so made, confirmed, published, and affixed,
will be binding upon all parties, and will justify any
person acting under them. This is essential to secure the
public safety which might oftentimes be greatly endan
gered by any breach of the regulations made in respect of
the use of the railway. In any proceeding to enforce the
bye-laws now under consideration, it will be deemed suf
ficient evidence of them to show that a printed paper or
painted board containing a copy of them was affixed and
continued as directed by the Act, or that if displaced or
damaged, it was repaired or restored as soon as conveniently
might be (b).
(a) 8 Vic. c. 20, s. 110. (b) Idem, s. 111.
CHAP. v1.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 399
If any breach of these bye-laws is committed, the com- Enforcement
pany may proceed to enforce the penalty in the manner *
directed, by summoning the offender before a magistrate;
and in cases where the infraction or non-observance of the
rule is attended with damage or annoyance to the public,
or hindrance to the company in the lawful use of the
railway, the latter may interfere summarily to abate or
remove the danger, annoyance, or hindrance, without pre
judice to the penalty incurred by the breach of it (a).
It is submitted, however, that unless the breach of any
such bye-law be such as is likely to cause public inconve
nience or injury, the company cannot arrest or detain a
party in order to carry him before a magistrate. There
fore, where the regulation which is broken was made for
the protection of the company only, it was held that the
company were liable to an action for false imprisonment
where they detained a passenger who had failed to produce
his ticket on demand, and who refused to comply with one
of their bye-laws which provided that in any such case the
passenger should pay the fare for the whole distance which
the train had travelled (b). And it would appear that “the

RAILwAY coMPANIEs are liable in respect of their pro
fits as owners and proprietors of the line, and of their
occupation of the land upon which it is constructed, to
certain rates, taxes, and assessments, parliamentary and
parochial. Such are, first, the Duties imposed upon them,
in respect of passengers conveyed for hire along the rail
way, by the 5 & 6 Wic. c. 79; secondly, the contributions
to which they are liable under rates for the relief of the
poor; and, thirdly, the rent-charge fixed upon the lands
of the railway and stations under the Tithe Commutation
Act.
By the statute 5 & 6 Wic. c. 79, (repealing certain duties
granted by 2 & 3 W. 4, c. 120, in respect of passengers
conveyed for hire along any railway in Great Britain), it is
enacted (a) that there shall be levied throughout Great Bri
tain in respect of the passengers conveyed upon any railway,
the duties specified in the schedule to that Act, which
shall be taken to be part of the Act; and that such duties
shall be under the management of the Commissioners of
Stamps and Taxes, and shall be deemed to be stamp duties.
The schedule to the Act states, that the duties in respect
of passengers conveyed for hire by carriages travelling upon
railways shall be as follows: viz. for and in respect of all
passengers conveyed for hire upon or along any railway,
a duty at and after the rate of five pounds for every one
hundred pounds upon all sums received or charged for
the hire, fare, or conveyance of all such passengers. An
exception, however, is made in the case of passengers car

ried in those trains provided for the conveyance of the
poorer classes of people; no tax being levied on the receipts
of any railway company for the conveyance of passengers
at fares not exceeding one penny for each mile (a). Nor
is there any tax payable on the receipts of a railway com
pany for the conveyance of goods.
For the purpose of a correct assessment of these duties,
every railway company is bound under the above Act to keep
account of all monies received daily by them, for the con
veyance of passengers over their own and other lines, and
of all monies paid by them to the proprietors of other rail
ways on account of fares received, or for the use of the
railway. Within five days after the first Monday in every
calendar month, (that is on or before the succeeding
Saturday) copies of these accounts for the preceding four
or five weeks, as the case may be, are to be delivered to
the Commissioners of Stamps and Taxes, and annexed
to the accounts an affidavit made before any justice of
the peace verifying their accuracy; and at the time of
so delivering the account the duties then due must be
paid (b).
Every railway company may deduct and retain out of
the monies to be paid over by them to any other company
the amount of the duties chargeable thereon, and which
they have paid, or are liable to pay (c).
All the books of a company containing accounts of the
monies received by them, which are subject to duty, are
to be open for the inspection and examination of any
officer of the stamp duties, authorised by the commissioners
in that behalf, who shall also be at liberty to take copies
of and make extracts from them or any of them. Any
refusal to permit this inspection will expose the party to
a penalty of fifty pounds for each offence. (d).
To secure the due performance of all the above provi
sions, the company is required to give, and renew as often
as occasion shall arise, a bond to her Majesty, her heirs,

obligations, under a penalty of £100 for refusal, and of
the further sum of £100 for every day during which the
neglect or refusal shall continue, or during which passen
gers shall be carried without such security having been
given (a).
Whilst a railway is in course of construction the com
pany are liable to contribute towards the poor's rate in
the various parishes through which it passes; for by the
133rd section of the 8 Vic. c. 18, it is enacted that if
the promoters of the undertaking become possessed by
virtue of this or the Special Act, or any Act incorporated
therewith, of any lands liable to be assessed to the poor’s
rate, they shall from time to time, until the works shall
be completed and assessed to such poor's rate, be liable to
make good the deficiency in the several assessments for
poor’s rate, by reason of such lands having been taken or
used for the purposes of the works; and such deficiency
shall be computed according to the rental at which such
lands, with any building thereon, were rated at the time
of the passing of the Special Act; and on demand of such
deficiency, the promoters of the undertaking, or their
treasurer, shall pay it to the collector.
But when all their works are completed, railway
companies are liable to be assessed to the rates made
for the relief of the poor in the several parishes
through which the line or any of its branches are
made to pass. They are liable to these rates on pre
cisely the same principles as the occupants of other pro
perty; that is as the owners and occupiers of the lands,
stations, and buildings, belonging to the railroad, and
for the value of such occupation. In treating of this
subject we shall notice, first, the property in respect of
which the company is liable to be rated, and the mode
in which it is to be estimated generally; secondly, its
apportionment among the different parishes through which
the line is constructed; and lastly, the deductions allowed
(a) 5 & 6 Wic. c. 79, s. 7.
CHAP. VII.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 403
to railway companies when thus assessed to the poor rate.
The whole law on this subject has been elaborately
argued, and deliberately considered by the Court of
Queen’s Bench in three recent cases (a); and from the
arguments and judgments in those cases, we shall gather
nearly everything to be said on the subject of this section,
using, as far as possible, (although without denoting it
in the usual way, which would lead to multiplied refer
ences) the language employed by the counsel and the
Court.
The profits of the trade carried on by the company,
whether as owners and proprietors of the line, or as com
mon carriers, are not directly the subject of the rate,
which is assessed only in respect of the occupation; but
in estimating the value of such occupation, which alone
is the subject of the rate, all those things must be in
cluded which at the time form part of it, whether perma
nently or not, and from whatever source derived. If,
therefore, the occupation of the lands and buildings by
the company acquire an increased value by reason of the
traffic they carry on upon the line, the profits arising
from this source form a chief element in the calculation,
when the land and stations come to be assessed to the
poor's-rate. By the value of the occupation is to be under
stood the sum which, after all due deductions made, a
tenant might be found to give by way of rent from year
to year, in order to be placed, as occupier, in the same
position as the party rated. In calculating the amount of
this rent, we must not consider that alone to which the
demise would convey a legal title, but that which it would
give the lessee the means of doing or enjoying, and which
would perhaps induce him to give a higher rent for it.
The very complicated nature of the accounts in the case

404 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book Iv.
of railway companies makes it difficult to arrive at a
correct and satisfactory result in any attempt to estimate
the value of their occupation, but the principle on which
they are to be rated is now settled beyond dispute.
It seems to be now decided that the gross receipts of the
company are to be taken as the basis of the rate; not as
in themselves rateable, but as a test of the value of the
occupation of the property which is rateable. These re
ceipts will include not only the tolls which, as owners of
the line, the company are entitled to demand, and have,
from persons running their own engines and carriages
upon it, but also all fares and remuneration received by
them, as carriers upon the line, upon their own account.
Not that these sources of income are rateable, considered
as referable to the trade alone, but as indicative of that
increase of value which the carrying on of the trade upon
the land gives to the occupation of it. The only question
is, Do the fares received increase actually the value of the
buildings and lands on which the rate is to be made? If
they do, and to whatever extent they do, to that extent,
due allowances always being supposed, they must directly
or indirectly be included. On this principle it is clear that
the remuneration received by the company as carriers, no
less than the tolls paid to them, as owners of the line,
must be taken into account, in assessing the rate. For
it is by reason of the occupation of the lands and
buildings rated that the company are enabled to carry on
a lucrative trade, and the facilities thus given for making
large profits are to be taken into consideration when esti
mating the rent which a tenant would give for the property,
with similar advantages for turning it to gainful purposes.
Moreover, the parish officers, in ascertaining how much net
rent such an occupation may be expected to command, are
to consider not drily and only what would legally pass by
the demise of it, but all the existing circumstances, whether
permanent or temporary, wherever situate, however arising,
or secured, which would reasonably influence the parties
CHAP. VII.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 405
to the negotiation for a tenancy,as to the amount ofthe rent.
The case is therefore similar to that of a house whose
annual value is increased by some fixture therein, as a
steel-yard, (a) or a billiard table (b); the nature of the
source of profit is not looked at, nor its purpose; but if,
in point of fact, an increased rent is obtained or obtain.
able, on that account, the rateable value is increased in
proportion. To this it is no answer to urge that the com
pany may give up the trade of carriers, and may take tolls
only for the use of the line; or that the monopoly which
most railway companies practically enjoy on their own
line may cease at any time, and the railroad be used as a
public highway. These considerations, so far as they lessen
the value of the rateable property, are to have their weight
in determining the assessment, but they do not affect the
principle. In so far as the facilities given to the occupant
of a railway and the stations for the carrying on of a
profitable trade increase the value of the occupation, so far
must those facilities be taken into account in estimating
their rateable value. The company are rated for the pro
perty they have, and the amount of the rate will vary with
the value of the thing rated. The original principle of
rating remains as it always was, and it must be applied to
the case of railway companies, as to any other case. The
criterion of rateable value is also the same (and above
alluded to), namely, what would a tenant give, from year
to year, for the privilege of using the property rated as the
company use it? Whatever that may be, it is the amount
(due deductions allowed for) on which the rate is to be
made. If the company retain and work the line them
selves, practically as monopolists, they will be rated on
this amount as for a supposed rent; if they lease the whole
line with all their rights, privileges, and facilities, the
lessee will pay on the real rent; or if they demise the line
and stations, and become mere carriers upon it, or give up
(a) Rex v. St. Nicholas, Gloucester, Cald. 262.
(b) Ibid, Judgment of Willes, J.
406 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book Iv.
the trade of carriers, and become occupiers only, in either
of these cases the rate would become apportionable be
tween two classes of occupiers, instead of being chargeable
on one. The assessment will vary both in its amount,
and in respect of the parties liable to it, according to cir
cumstances, but the principle of the law which makes
railway property liable to rates for the relief of the poor,
remains unaltered, the reason remaining the same; namely,
that additional value is given to the occupation both of the
lands and stations, by reason of the purposes for which
they are used, and the extraordinary profits made by the
occupier.
In estimating the rent which a tenant would give for
the portion of the line in any particular parish, the calcu
lation must not be made on the supposition that the rail
road is broken up into parochial portions, and then, in
imagination, severing each from the buildings which the
occupiers occupy together with it, defacto, exclusively, and
under the authority of the same statutes, passed in
furtherance of one great scheme, and then again, in imagi
nation, severing both from the traffic which the occupiers
carry on, in, by, and throughout the whole, de facto, ex
clusively, and for the sake of which they have made, built,
and occupy the whole; for the great object in rating is to
procure equality, and to bring everything into contribution
which ought to share the public burthen, and the sub
stance, and not the form, must therefore be regarded.
The line must be considered as an entirety, and the rent
as an entire rent, though artificially divided into several
payments (a). Any other principle would be manifestly
absurd, and an evasion rather than an application of the
law. And although the subject-matter of the rate in any
particular parish is the beneficial occupation of the land
there, so that the value of the occupation of buildings
elsewhere cannot be included, yet as the rate is to be made
(a) Judgment of Lord Ellenborough, C. J. in Rex v. Bradford, 4 M.
& S. 317.
CHA P. v11.] WORKING OF THE LINE, 407
on the value in the parish, however occasioned, no portion
can be struck off, because it would not have existed but for
the occupation of buildings in another parish, still it exists,
and in the parish, and therefore cannot escape the rate
there. If the land occupied by a railway company in any
given parish, be, in fact, more valuable to them, by reason
of their occupation of other portions of the line, stations,
and buildings elsewhere, this actual increase of value, be it
more or less, is not to be excluded from the assessment
because it arises indirectly from property situated in other
parishes. The whole of the line, with all the build
ings, are directly necessary to the traffic which produces
the profits which enhance the value of the occupation
in each locality, through which the railway is made to
pass.
A railway company is rateable in each parish in pro
portion to the amount of profit derived on that part of
the railway within it, and not merely in the ratio of the
length of the way within the parish to the whole length of
the railway; and this, although the additional value of that
part of the line might arise in some manner from the station
houses and other works not within the parish. By arrange
ment, however, among respondent parishes, the mode
adopted for measuring the rate may be according to the
proportion which the mileage of the railway in the respond
ent parish bears to the whole length of the way, assuming
the profits to arise equally through the whole. Which
ever of these principles be adopted, the company will be
rateable, although the portion of railway rated in any given
parish may be worked by the company at a loss, for if the
first principle be adopted, and the expenditure exceed the
receipts within the parish, but the company still find it
worth their while to maintain and work it for the sake of
the traffic which it brings over other portions of the line,
it is a profitable or beneficial occupation within the mean
ing of the Parochial Assessment Act, and the company are
rateable accordingly; and if the second principle be

adopted, the proportion of the whole profits according to
the length of railroad in the parish will determine the
amount of the rate. -
Having treated of the property in a railway which is the
subject of a rate, and the principle of apportionment among
the parishes through which the line passes, it now only
remains to notice the deductions which have been allowed
in ascertaining the net annual value of the company’s
occupation. In assessing a railroad, the first point is to
ascertain the gross receipts of the occupiers of it, and then
to deduct therefrom all such items as are properly referable
to the trade carried on upon it, as distinguished from the
increased value which that trade gives to the land. The
residue will represent the value of the occupation, exclusive
of the profits of the trade. In the case of the Queen v.
the Grand Junction Railway Company (a), the parish offi
cers adopted, and the sessions approved the following mode
of calculating the net annual value of the company’s rate
able property in their parish.
They ascertained the gross receipts of the company for
one year £440,366, and made therefrom the following
deductions : —
1. £5 per cent. for interest on £255,000, the capital
employed in engines, carriages, and other moveable stock,
in their business as carriers.
2. £20 per cent, on the same capital, for tenants’ pro
fits and profits of trade.
3. £12 10s. per cent, on the same, for the depreciation
of such stock, beyond usual repairs and expenses.
4. £198,962 for the annual cost of conducting the
business.
5. £9,150 for the land occupied by stations and other
buildings, separately rated in the parishes in which they
are situate.
6. £30 per mile for the reproduction of rails, chairs,
(a) 4Q. B. 18; 4 Rail. Ca. 1.
CHAP. v11.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 409
sleepers, &c. On the company appealing against the rate,
a case was stated for the opinion of the Court of Queen's
Bench; and on the argument the Court held, that with
regard to the reasonableness of the amount of these several
deductions, that was for the Sessions to decide; and, having
decided it, the Court could not review their decision. With
respect to the principle on which the deductions were
made, the Court confirmed the order of Sessions, Lord
Denman, C.J., saying, “These deductions, taken together,
seem to us to include whatever is properly referable to
the trade, and distinguishable from the increased value
which that trade gives to the land.”
In addition to the above items, the company claimed to
be allowed something for goodwill, on the ground that a
person bargaining with them to become the yearly tenant
of their railway, in the expectation of succeeding to their
trade as a probable consequence of succeeding to their
occupation, would properly be called upon to pay them
something for the goodwill of that trade; and that this
would be in the nature of an outgoing and deduction from
the profit. The Court, however, disallowed the claim, say
ing, “This objection appears capable of two answers: the
first and decisive one is, that the purchase of goodwill
implies that a trade is sold, that the company are to be
bound to surrender their trade to the lessee, and no longer
to be carriers on the line; but the calculation of the Ses
sions proceeds on no such supposition; all those special
advantages, indeed, for carrying it on, which the occupa
tion gives them, whatever they may be, they must neces
sarily surrender; but the moment they have leased the
railway they become part of the public, and would have
the right of carrying on their trade, retaining all the good
will, with all those advantages which were carefully re
served to the public. Secondly, although the supposition
of a tenancy is to be made, yet what the incidents of the
tenancy must be as to the actual terms and allowances
must be determined, for the purpose of fixing the amount
E. E.
410 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book IV.
of the rate, by the actual state of things; for this suppo
sition of a tenancy is only a mode of ascertaining the ex
isting value of the occupation to the existing occupier.
Now here there is no tenancy in fact; no goodwill is in
fact paid for, and therefore no deduction ought, in fact, to
be made on account of its price” (a).
In another case (b), the mode adopted by the parish
officers in rating the railway was as follows:—They took
the gross receipts per mile in the respondent parish.
From this they deducted a mileage proportion of the ex
penses, and of the interest and tenants’ profits on the
plant of the whole line of railway, and rated the company
on the residue. In addition, however, to the deductions
thus made, the company claimed to be allowed for the
stations and other erections on the line for which they
were rated separately, and no part of which was within
the parish; and the Court held that they were entitled to
this deduction.
The company also claimed a deduction of the income
tax paid by them, amounting to £10,000; and the Court
held that they were entitled, on ordinary principles, to so
much of it as was a charge on the occupation, and payable
by the tenant.
The company also claimed an allowance for the wear
and tear of rails and sleepers, the solid timber and iron
work of their own principal line; and this, although they
had theretofore paid such expenses out of their capital,
and not charged it against their income. With regard to
this item, the Court seemed to consider that such repairs
could not be distinguished in principle from “maintenance
of way,” included in the company's annual expenses; so
that although they might not be called for in any parti
cular year, yet if, knowing that the charge would in a
given time accrue, a proportional sum were actually de

CHAP. v11.] WORKING OF THE LINE. 411
ducted from the annual revenue, with the view of meeting
it, it ought to be allowed just as though repairs to that
amount were actually done in the course of the year.
But if no such deduction from annual revenue for this
purpose were made, then they could not be allowed for
it, inasmuch as, in ordinary cases, the mere fact of repairs
being needed would not entitle to a deduction, unless
they were done and the charge incurred. So, if the costs
of such reparations be defrayed out of the capital of the
company, no allowance can be made for them as annual
expenses; for by this mode of meeting the charge, the
company give to the works done the character of landlords'
improvements, rather than that of tenants’ repairs, and the
money so expended goes therefore to swell the rateable
value of the land, but will not be allowed in the rate.
Such charges, however, would be met by the deduction
made for interest upon capital, if the effect of them be to
increase the aggregate value of the plant and machinery;
for the allowance under this head must be made with a
reference to the actual and then present value of the capi
tal of the company so invested, and will vary in amount,
therefore, with the increase or diminution in that value;
nor is it correct to allow upon the original amount of
capital embarked, if the value of the moveable stock have
been since diminished.
Although interest on the capital of a company is al
lowed in assessing them to the poors’ rate, yet in esti
mating the amount of such capital the costs and expenses
of obtaining an Act of Parliament will not be allowed to
form part of it; nor any of the original and preliminary
expenses incurred in the formation, establishment, and
incorporation of the company. For these expenses have
no connexion with the rateable value of the railway, and the
owners and occupiers of it have no more right to be allowed
for them, than the purchaser of an estate who, after an
expensive litigation as to the title, had borrowed money
to meet the costs of it, would be entitled to deduct his

Recovery of.
interest and expenses from poor rate on the land in his
occupation.
It only remains to add on this subject, a word as to
the mode of recovering arrears of poors’ rate due from
a railway company. It would seem that there is the
same remedy against them as against an ordinary rate
payer; namely, by proper demand of the exact sum; and,
on refusal, by summons for them to appear before two
justices, to shew cause why they should not pay the rate.
If they do not appear, or appearing, shew no sufficient
cause, then, upon oath of the demand and refusal, and of
the due service of the summons, the justices may grant a
distress warrant. This warrant may be executed upon
the goods of the company, not only in the place where
they were assessed for the rate in arrear, but in any other
place within the same county or precinct; or, if sufficient
distress cannot be found there, then, on oath made thereof
before some justice of any other county (this oath to be
certified under the hand of the justice upon the warrant),
the goods of the party neglecting or refusing to pay may
be levied in such other county by virtue of the warrant
and certificate (a).
It would seem doubtful whether a writ of mandamus
would lie to compel a railway company to pay arrears of
poor rate; but, at all events, it could not be obtained
until the remedy by distress had been tried and had failed
for want of sufficient goods of the company whereon it
might be levied: and any omission to recite this fact in
the writ would furnish the defendant with a fatal ob
jection, which he might avail himself of after a return, or
at any time before a peremptory mandamus issued (b).

through which the railway passes to assess it for the pur

site information for making a correct assessment, the
company are required (a) to prepare an annual account
(made up to the 31st of December in each year) of their
receipts and payments, with a statement of the balance
of such account, duly audited and certified; and, if re
quired, must transmit a copy of it, free of charge, to the
overseers of the poor of the several parishes through which
the railway passes, and also to the clerks of the peace of
the several counties traversed by the line, on or before
the 31st day of January then next; and for any omission
to prepare or transmit such account, if required so to do
by any such clerk of the peace or overseers of the poor,
the company will forfeit the sum of £20. The copy of
this account thus required to be deposited with the clerks
of the peace, will be open for the inspection of the public
at all seasonable hours, on payment of the sum of one
shilling for every such inspection.
When a railway company take possession of lands under
the powers of their Act, which are subject to a rent
charge under the Tithe Commutation Act, the property
will remain subject, as before, to the payment of it, such
fresh apportionment being made as the severance of the
land taken from the other lands may render necessary.
The ordinary remedies for the recovery of such rent
charges (b) being found insufficient in the case of railway
companies refusing to pay their apportionment (c), special
provisions have been made to meet such cases by the
7 & 8 Vict. c. 85, which enacts (d), that “whenever any
apportionment of tithe commutation rent-charges shall

CHAPTER VIII.
GOVERNMENT NOTICES AND RETURNS.
It now only remains to notice under the head “Working
the Line,” those returns of accidents, of traffic, and of
tolls, which the company are required, under the provi
sions of the General or Special Railway Acts, to prepare
and transmit, periodically or otherwise, to certain public
offices and departments.
(1) Notices and Returns of Accidents.—By the statute
5 & 6 Vict. c. 55, section 7, it is enacted, that every rail
way company shall, within forty-eight hours after the
occurrence upon the railway belonging to the company,
of any accident attended with serious personal injury to
any of the public using the same, give notice thereof to
the Commissioners of Railways, under a penalty of £5
for every day of their wilful neglect or refusal. It would
seem from the terms of this enactment, that the required
notice need not be given unless some passenger or person
using the railway has been seriously injured upon it; and
that no penalty would be incurred for omitting to give it,
where the injury was inflicted on a person trespassing
upon the line, or crossing it for lawful purposes, but who
was not a passenger travelling along it, and was not
therefore “using” it in the sense intended by the Act.
So if the accident occurred, not to any of the public, but
to some servant of the company, whether he were travel
ling by a train, as an engine-driver or conductor, or were
injured whilst in the discharge of his duties or otherwise,
at any station, the notice would not be necessary. In all
these cases, if death resulted, an inquest would be held
for the purpose of ascertaining its cause; but the sta

The Commissioners are also empowered to order any
railway company to make a return of all serious accidents
occurring in the course of the public traffic upon their

after it has been demanded, under a penalty of £5 for
every day’s delay. The document so prepared and trans
mitted will be deemed a privileged communication, and
will not be evidence in any court whatsoever (a). This
clause is more general in its terms than the one previously
cited, and would seem to embrace all cases of accidents,
whether to passengers or to parties not passengers, and
whether the individual sustaining an injury were a servant
of the company or one of the public. So, although no
personal injury of any kind is sustained, yet, if the occur
rence may be fairly considered as a serious accident, it
must be included in the return which the Commissioners
are authorised to require, and the company are bound to
render under the above provision.

ers of Railways may order every railway company to
make up and deliver to them returns, according to a form
to be given, of the aggregate traffic in passengers, accord
ing to the several classes, and of the aggregate traffic in
cattle and goods respectively on their railway; and also a
table of all tolls, rates, and charges from time to time
levied on each class of passengers, and on cattle and goods,
conveyed on the said railway. These returns must be
made within thirty days of their being ordered, under a
penalty of £20 for every day's wilful neglect. These re

time of all railway companies, except such as shall be
specially exempted for reasons entered on the minutes of
their proceedings by the Commissioners of Railways. Any
officer of a company wilfully making a false return, will
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor (a).
The provisions above enumerated respecting notices and
returns of accidents, and returns of traffic and of tolls,
in direct terms apply only to the railway belonging to the
company; but it seems reasonable to conclude that all
lines leased and worked by the company, must be consi
dered as not less within the scope of the enactments than
their own: and that the same duties will be cast upon the
company whether they be lessees or proprietors of the
railroad. This inference is strengthened by a reference to
the Railways’ Clauses Act, which provides (b) that the
lessees of a railway shall not only be invested with the
powers, and entitled to the rights and privileges of the
company letting it, but shall also be subject to all the
same restrictions and obligations. •,

AND
GOVERNMENT OF THE COMPANY.
A RAILwAY company being a creature of the statute, is
controlled by the Acts under which it exists. General
powers for the incorporation and government of the com
pany and the raising of capital, whether by shares or by
loan, are given by the Special Act, but the mode in which
and the restrictions under which these powers are to be
exercised, are determined by the Companies’ Clauses Act,
which contains various and minute regulations on these
subjects. All the movements of the company are to be
regulated in obedience to these general and special enact
ments; and we propose, in this book, to classify the nu
merous rules thus laid down by the legislature in reference
to the internal government and external relations of incor
porated railway companies. This extensive branch of our
general subject may, perhaps, be conveniently considered
under the following heads; treating, first of the law re
lating to the government, constitution, and functions of a
company in relation to the general management of its
affairs; secondly, of the regulations as to the raising,
distributing, appropriating, and transferring the capital;
and thirdly, of the enactments and general principles of
law which prescribe the conditions of contracts by and
with the company, and modify its external relations in
those respects.

CHAPTER I.
AS TO GOVERNMENT.
THE law which prescribes the mode in which a railway
company is to be governed, relates either to the qualifica
tion, election, powers, duties, liabilities, protection, and
remuneration of the members of the governing body; or
to the mode in which, the times at which, and the pur
poses for which, meetings of the whole body, or of the
board of directors, are to be held, and the manner in
which the business is to be disposed of; or to the appoint
ment, duties, and responsibilities of the officers and ser
vants of the company. We shall treat of them in their
order.
SEC. I.—Directors.
The Act by which a railway company is incorporated
uniformly prescribes the number of directors, names those
who shall constitute the first board, and usually gives a
power to increase or decrease the number within certain
limits.
The clauses in a Special Act which prescribe the num
ber of directors, the number of a quorum, and the mode
of supplying vacancies, have been held to be directory
only; and the business of the company might therefore
be managed by a less than the prescribed number, pro
vided the shareholders did not interfere to require the
completion of the number: and that, at all events, as
these provisions were intended for the internal manage
ment of the company only, they could not affect its ex
CHAP. I.] CONSTITUTION, FUNCTIONS, AND GoverNMENT. 421
ternal affairs, or the power of the directors to enforce the
payment of calls, nor be taken advantage of by a share
holder in answer to an action for calls (a).
The 81st section of the Companies’ Clauses Act, which
enacts that “the number of directors shall be the pre
scribed number,” although peremptory in its form, would
probably be construed in conformity with the above deci
sion; especially as another section of the same statute (b)
provides that the acts of directors shall be valid notwith
standing any defect in their appointment. Any party who
is dissatisfied with a company on the ground that there
is not a full number of directors, may apply for a man
damus to have the number completed (c).
In any case in which a railway company shall be au
thorised to vary the number of their directors, they may
do so at a general meeting, after due notice for that pur
pose (d).
No person is capable of becoming or acting as a director
in any railway company unless he be a shareholder; and if
the Special Act prescribe, as it generally does, the number
of shares which a director must possess, he cannot be elected
unless he be the proprietor of that number (e). Hence,
on ceasing in any way (whether by sale or otherwise) to
be the owner of the required number of shares, a director
vacates his office, having lost the necessary qualification.
So, on becoming bankrupt, a director ceases to be such,
as he is no longer a holder of shares, the interest in
them having passed from him to his assignees (f). The
property in the shares must, however, be effectually and
absolutely transferred; and a mere incumbrance or pledg
ing of them will not suffice to disqualify the holder. Thus,

where a party’s qualification to act as a director of a com
pany consisted in his being the proprietor of a certain
number of shares, it was held that he did not lose his
qualification by mortgaging them (a); for mortgaged
shares, although subject to the lien of the mortgagee, are
still, as between the company and himself, the property
of the mortgagor.
Nor is a person holding any office or place of trust and
profit under the company, or interested in any contract with
the company, capable of becoming or acting as a director;
nor may any director accept any other office or place oftrust
and profit under the company, or become interested in any
contract with it during the time he remains a director;
or, on doing so, his office will become vacant, and he must
thenceforth cease from voting or acting as a director (b).
The nature of the interest in a contract with the com
pany which will disqualify a director, came under the
consideration of the Court in the following case (c):—
Certain directors of a railway company were members
of a banking company, who were the bankers and trea
surers of the railway company, and as such received and
gave receipts for calls, and paid cheques drawn by the di
rectors, &c. A clause of the Act incorporating the com
pany enacted, that no person concerned or interested in
any contract with the company, should be capable of being
chosen a director; and that, if any director should, di
rectly or indirectly, be concerned in any contract with the
company, he should thereupon be immediately, and was
thereby, discharged from the direction. It was held that
this clause applied only to contracts made with the com
pany in prosecution of its enterprise, and did not dis
qualify the directors above mentioned.
However, by the Companies’ Clauses Act (d), it is ex
pressly provided, that “no person being a shareholder or
member of any incorporated joint stock company, shall be

disqualified or prevented from acting as a director by
reason of any contract entered into between such joint
stock company and the company incorporated by the
Special Act; but no such director, being a shareholder or
member of such joint stock company, shall vote on any
question as to any contract with such joint stock com
pany.”
It is submitted that the exception thus made in favour of
directors who may be shareholders or members of any other
incorporated joint stock company, would apply only to such
companies as have been incorporated by Special Acts, and
not to joint stock companies incorporated by complete
registration under the 7 & 8 Vic. c. 110; and hence a mem
ber of one of the latter, being a director of a railway
company contracting with it, would be thereby disquali
fied. The existence of an unlimited liability in the case of
shareholders in registered companies making the interest
of each in every contract made by them so direct as to
come within the mischief provided for by the 86th sec
tion. The fact of a disqualifying interest attaching to
any director, will not, however, have the effect of avoiding
a contract made by the board (a).
Before dismissing this subject, we may remark, that in
contracts of lease or amalgamation between railway com
panies, it is frequently made a condition of the contract
that certain directors of the one should become members
of the board of the other, for the purpose of exercising a
control over its affairs, and securing an equitable compli
ance with the terms of the contract. In such cases, the
provision under consideration effectually defeats the ob
ject in view, inasmuch as the directors of one company
thus made directors of the other, are disqualified from
voting upon any question affecting the interests ofthe com
pany on whose behalf they were appointed.
A director may not only cease to be such by parting

with his shares, and thereby losing his qualification, or
by accepting some place of trust or profit under the com
pany, or becoming interested in some contract made with
it, and thus acquiring a disqualifying interest; but he
may become incompetent to act on other grounds, as
lunacy, protracted absence from the country, or other
causes. What may be deemed under the words of the
statute a becoming “incompetent to act,” may perhaps
be inferred from a decision under a similar clause in a
deed where the words used were “incapable to act.”
The party in question absconded to America under cir
cumstances strongly evidencing no intention to return;
and it was held that by so doing he had become “inca
pable to act” (a).
The directors appointed by the Special Act (unless it
be thereby otherwise provided) continue in office “until
the first ordinary meeting of the company in the year next
after that in which the Special Act shall have passed” (b).
At that meeting the shareholders, personally or by proxy,
may either continue the whole or any number of the ex
isting directors, or may elect a new body of directors in
their place; and at the first ordinary meeting in every
successive year, the shareholders present are to elect per
sons to supply the places of the retiring directors, or, if a
quorum of electors be not present within one hour of the
time appointed for the meeting, or within one hour of the
time appointed for the meeting on the following day, the
existing directors will continue in office until the first or
dinary meeting in the next year (c).
At the meeting held for the purpose of electing direc
tors, the names of the parties proposed must be put up
separately, and the show of hands taken in respect of each
individual. If a list of names be proposed, on which the

votes are taken collectively and not individually, it is
open to objection on the ground that such a mode of
electing is calculated to produce not a real but an apparent
unanimity only (a).
If the prescribed number of shareholders be present at
the meeting, and a majority dissent from an election, or
protest against the candidate, but vote for nobody else, it
would seem that the election by the minority is good (b).
Where, however, there are two or more directors to be
elected, and the names of the candidates are put up in
succession, and some one of them has not the show of
hands in his favour, and a poll is demanded; the poll must
be opened for all the candidates, as well for those in whose
favour there had been a show of hands, as for those who
had demanded the poll.
The directors are to “retire from office at the times and
in the proportions following; the individuals to retire being
in each instance determined by ballot among the directors,
unless they shall otherwise agree, (that is to say):—
At the end of the first year after the first election of
directors, the prescribed number, and if no number be
prescribed, one-third of such directors, to be determined
by ballot among themselves unless they shall otherwise
agree, shall go out of office.
At the end of the second year, the prescribed number,
and if no number be prescribed, one-half of the remaining
number of such directors, to be determined in like man
ner, shall go out of office.
At the end of the third year, the prescribed number, and
if no number be prescribed, the remainder of such direc
tors shall go out of office.

shall be supplied by an equal number of qualified share
holders; and at the first ordinary meeting in every subse

quent year, the prescribed number, and if no number be

Retiring directors are eligible for immediate re-election,
and if re-elected will, in respect of going out by rotation,
be deemed new directors. If the number of directors be
not divisible by three, nor the number to retire be pre
scribed, the directors are in each case to arrange it so that
the whole number may go out of office in three years, in
divisions as nearly equal as may be (a).
These provisions require no comment, except that, on
comparison of the 84th and 88th sections of the Act, some
doubt may arise as to the position of retiring directors
continuing in office because no valid meeting of share
holders took place to elect their successors. It would
seem, however, from the words of the former section, that
the directors so retaining office are to be deemed not re
elected, but as the retiring officers of the next year; the
clause providing only that they shall “continue to act
and retain their powers until new directors be appointed
at the first ordinary meeting of the following year.”

the company; but all the powers so to be exercised shall
be exercised in accordance with and subject to the provi
sions of this and the Special Act; and the exercise of all
such powers shall be subject also to the control and regu
lation of any special meeting specially convened for the
purpose, but not so as to render invalid any act done by

meeting.”
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 88.
CHAP. I.] CONSTITUTION, FUNCTIONS, AND Gov ERNMENT. 427
The powers thus entrusted to the directors are, there
fore, with certain specified exceptions hereafter enume
rated, the general powers of the company. What the
whole body is empowered to do, that, for convenience
sake, the governing body is authorised to do on their be
half. The board of directors is, in fact, the company in
action. All the powers of the incorporation are entrusted
to, and its functions are discharged by, the directors, who
are thus the representatives of the whole. What they do
is done by the company. And as their power (with the
exceptions to be specified) is co-extensive with that of the
body corporate, so it is limited and restricted in the same
manner. Some things indeed, as we shall see, the whole
aggregate of members in public meeting assembled may
do, which the board of directors may not; things of so
much importance that the powers of the company to do
them are not delegated to any representatives; but the
board cannot do anything which the company itself might
not do.
Moreover, the delegated authority which the directors
possess, is to be exercised under the control of the mem
bers, who, at an extraordinary meeting called for the
purpose, may review what has been done. They cannot,
however, invalidate anything already dome by the board,
provided what was done was within the scope of their au
thority, and was untainted by fraud. For although the
authority be delegated, yet such delegation is not a mere
voluntary act of the shareholders which can be rescinded
at pleasure, but is enjoined upon them by the statute, and
hence the company can only act (except where otherwise
provided) through its board of directors.
The powers possessed by the directors of a railway
company, to be exercised by themselves without any meet
ing of the shareholders, may be divided into such as relate
more directly to their own board, and the discharge of
their own immediate duties as the committee of manage
ment; and such as relate to the general business and

affairs of the company. Under the first head, we may
mention the power of the directors to elect their chairman
and vice-chairman, to appoint the times and places of
their meeting, to fill up certain vacancies occurring in
their own body, and to appoint committees of their mem
bers. Under the second division, we may notice that, as
regards the financial affairs of the company, the directors
are empowered to make calls, and enforce payment of
them by actions against defaulters; to charge interest on
calls in arrear, and to allow interest on such as are paid
in advance; to declare dividends, to employ the capital
of the company in the promotion of its general objects
and purposes at their discretion, subject to the statutory
restrictions imposed upon them; to set apart certain sums
for contingencies; and to pay and receive (through any
officers they may appoint for that purpose) all moneys due
to or from the company. So the directors have power to
enact, alter, and repeal, as they may think right, bye-laws
regulating the conduct of their own servants, and the
user of the line by the public; to impose fines for the
breach of them, subject, in certain cases, to the approval
of such bye-laws by the Commissioners of Railways. They
may also appoint and dismiss, at their pleasure, all the
officers and servants of the company. And further, in
relation to all contracts entered into by the company, and
to the registers, books, and accounts to be kept, they are
empowered to make all proper arrangements for the cor
rect entry and balancing of such accounts, and for the
inspection of them and of the registers, and may order the
transfer books to be closed for a certain period previous to
each ordinary meeting; and, lastly, may contract with pri
vate individuals or with other companies for the purchase
of land, compensation for the execution of the works, for
engines and carriages, for fuel or for any other goods; or
for the performance of any labour, or for any services, pro
fessional or otherwise, required for the general purposes of
the company.
CHAP. I.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCT10Ns, AND Gov ERNMENT. 429
It is not necessary for the due exercise of the powers
above enumerated, that the directors should meet and act
as a board, for, as we have seen, they may appoint one or
more committees, consisting of the prescribed number (if
any), or of such number as they think fit, and may entrust
them with the same power as they themselves possess, to
act on behalf of the company in the management of its
affairs; and all the acts and contracts of any committee
duly constituted, will be as valid as if they had been done
and entered into by the whole body (a).
The powers of the company which can only be exercised
at a general meeting, are those relating to the choice and
removal of directors (except the supplying of occasional
vacancies); the increasing or reducing of their number
when authorised by the Special Act; the selection of
auditors; the determination as to the remuneration of the
directors, auditors, treasurer, and secretary; the deter
mination as to the amount of money to be borrowed on
mortgage; the determination as to the reduction or aug
mentation of capital, and the declaration of dividends; and
agreements for the lease, sale, or amalgamation of the line.
Powers, however, for the purposes last-mentioned must be
given expressly by the legislature, as they do not attach to
a railway company, as such, on the passing of the Act of
Incorporation.
In addition to these matters thus excepted out of
the general authority of the directors, the Special Act
may impose further limitations and restraints upon the
power of the board. But if it do not, the directors will
be the legal and duly authorised organs of the com
pany in relation to all objects and for all purposes not
expressly excluded from their control; or, in the words of
the statute, they will have “the management and super
intendence of the affairs of the company, and they may
lawfully exercise all the powers of the company.”
The extensive powers wherewith the board of directors
is thus entrusted, involve corresponding obligations.

(f) Duties of
the directors,
430 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book V.
They are not only empowered to “manage and super
intend,” but they are appointed to do it. Hence their
duties are, generally, to exercise their large powers for
the benefit of the company, in the promotion of its ob
jects, the discharge of its business, and the advancement
of its interests, in the innumerable ways in which it may
be done.
All the principal duties of the directors either have
already or will subsequently come minutely under our
consideration, under the various sections of this work.
Wherever the company's business is to be done, or its
rights are to be protected or vindicated; wherever it would
contract with other parties, or enforce its claims against
them; wherever it would arrange its internal affairs, or
promote its public objects, there dutics devolve upon the
governing body. Hence they change with the changing
condition of the company, with the various stages of its
existence, and with the different aspects which it bears
towards the publić, whether viewed as the purchaser of
land for the line, or as contracting for work, labour, and
materials for the purpose of forming it; or regarded as
working a line already formed, whether as the proprietors
of it, or as common carriers. So these duties vary in re
lation to the members of the company no less than in
relation to third parties; at one time imposing the obliga
tion of making and enforcing the payment of calls; at
another regulating the number and amount of dividends,
suggesting variations of the scheme and objects of the
company, and making provision for promoting itsinterests,
as new circumstances arise which may render desirable a
change of policy or of purpose.
These manifold duties of the directors of a railway
company divide themselves into three general branches;
those which relate more especially to the company itself,
and to the general body of the shareholders, including all
matters of internal regulation and management; those
which have a more direct reference to third parties,
whether as users of the line or vendors of land, or as
Cli Alp. 1.] constituTION, FUNCTIONS, AND GovERNMENT. 431
parties contracting with the company; and those which
devolve upon them in relation to Government, and to
public officers and bodies. Of the first class the following
are the principal:—
The directors are bound to apply all moneys, whether
raised by loan or otherwise, first, in paying the costs and
expenses incurred in obtaining the Special Act, or inci
dental thereto; and then in the purchase of land, the
formation of the line, and in the furtherance of the general
purposes and objects of the company (a). They may not,
however, expend any of their capital in a manner not
authorised by their Act of Incorporation, although the
ultimate advantage of the company might be secured by
such an application of the funds (b). Thus, they would
not be entitled to lend or advance money to other com
panies to enable them to make their deposits under the
Standing Orders of Parliament, although the interests of
the company might be materially promoted by the success
of those applying for legislative sanction. So they will
not be allowed to pledge the funds of the shareholders in
the way of guarantee or otherwise, to the subscribers to
any other company, except under the powers conferred in
the Special or General Railway Acts. Therefore, where
a board of directors of a railway company undertook to
guarantee to the subscribers of a steam-packet company a
certain amount of dividends upon the capital to be ex
pended, the Court of Chancery granted an injunction
restraining them from so pledging the capital of the com
pany (c. -
It is the duty of the directors to invest the funds in
their hands in government securities, and to sell out as the
works proceed and as cash may be required. So they are
bound to make calls upon the shareholders at such times,
and of such amounts (authorised by their Act), as the

progress of the works and the exigencies of the company
may render necessary: and although, in one case, where
an action had been brought and judgment entered up
against the company, and there were no assets, the Court
of Queen’s Bench refused to issue a mandamus at the
instance of a creditor, commanding the directors to make
a call (a); yet it is submitted, that where a shareholder
has been compelled under an execution issued at the suit
of a creditor of the company to pay moneys beyond the
amount of calls then due in respect of the shares held by
him, the Court would grant a mandamus commanding
the board of directors to make a call in order to reimburse
him. The directors are not only to make calls when the
company is in want of funds, but they are bound also to
enforce the payment thereof, with interest, by action
against the party in default, or, after the expiration of the
proper period, to declare the shares forfeited.
It is the duty of the directors also to keep a register of
the shareholders, containing, in alphabetical order, correct
entries made from time to time of the names and additions
of all parties entitled to any shares in the company (b); and
also a book containing, in alphabetical order, the names
and descriptions, and places of business and abode of the
several shareholders, to be called the “Shareholders’ Ad
dress Book,” which is to be open to the inspection of
every member of the company, and to any judgment cre
ditor, free of charge, and extracts from which may be
demanded on payment of the proper fee (c). So they are
bound to keep a register of all transfers of shares from
time to time made, entering therein a memorial of the
deed of transfer, and endorsing that entry upon the deed,
on payment of the prescribed fee (d).
It is their duty also, on demand of the holder of any
share in the company, and on payment of the fee, to give
him a certificate of the proprietorship thereof, under the
(a) Reg. v. Victoria Park Com. 4 P. & D. 639.

common seal of the company, and to renew such certificate
as often as sufficient proof is given that it is lost or de
stroyed, or, if worn out or damaged, on its being delivered
up to be cancelled (a).
So the directors are bound, in the creation of new shares,
where the old are at a premium, to apportion them equally
among the original proprietors, according to the number
of shares possessed by each; and with respect to those
which are not taken up by the persons to whom they have
been offered, they must dispose of them in the manner
which in their discretion appears to be most for the inte
rest of the company (b).
They must also cause full and true accounts to be kept
of all money received and expended, and have the accounts
properly balanced at the times fixed for that purpose, and
a correct balance sheet prepared, examined, and signed by
the chairman, and submitted to the inspection of the
shareholders. They must also permit inspection of the
company’s accounts, free of charge, at all seasonable
times, to all bond, mortgage, or judgment creditors (c).
They must also appoint all proper book-keepers and ac
countants, and provide suitable and sufficient books for
the various entries (d). The accounts and balance sheet
thus made out, the directors are bound to deliver to the
auditors fourteen days before each half-yearly meeting (e).
Moreover, notes, minutes, or copies, must be kept by
the directors, of all appointments made or contracts en
tered into by them on behalf of the company, and of all
the proceedings at the meetings of the company, or of the
directors, or of their committees; and the chairman must
sign all such entries (f).
They are also bound to require securities from all
officers of the company, whether treasurers, collectors, or
others who may be in any way entrusted with the custody

and control of moneys belonging to the company, for the
faithful execution of their respective duties (a).
It devolves upon the directors also to convene all the
ordinary meetings of the company, giving the requisite
notices by advertisement or otherwise, and also to call
such extraordinary meetings as may be requested by the
prescribed number of shareholders (b). So they must
meet as a board of directors for the transaction of busi
mess as often as the affairs of the company may require;
and the several committees of directors as frequently as
may be necessary for the discharge of their duties (c). Any
vacancy occurring in their body by the death, resignation,
or supervening disqualification of any director, they ought
to fill up (d).
The second class of duties devolving on the directors of
a railway company, is that relating to third parties, and
respects the position of the company chiefly, first, as en
gaged in constructing the line, and then in working it.
During the formation of the railroad and the execution of
the works, the directors are bound to give all proper no
tices to land-owners and others whose property will be
required or damaged by the company; to take all the pre
scribed steps for ascertaining the amount of compensation,
to pay or deposit it at the proper times, and before enter
ing on the lands; to acquire a good title to, and secure a
valid conveyance of, the property purchased. So they
must make all proper communications between severed
lands, permitting the parties interested to cross the line
until they are made; and must provide suitableand sufficient
accommodation works to replace such as have been removed
or destroyed by the construction of the railway. So they
must carefully fence off the line from all adjoining lands,
make all proper gates at crossings, and screens, and other
necessary works. They must also, with all convenient ex
pedition, complete the line throughout, according to the

plans; and maintain and repair it thereafter in a good and
serviceable state. They must, moreover, permit the owners
of adjoining lands to make branches, under the conditions
prescribed.
In working the line, the directors will be bound to carry
on equal terms for all parties; to graduate their scale of
tolls, rates, and fares, so that they may be reasonable,
equal, and impartial; and to publish them as required by
their Act. They must also enact and publish, when sanc
tioned by the Commissioners of Railways, such bye-laws as
may be necessary for regulating the user of the railway by
the public; and in relation to their trains both for con
veyance of passengers and goods, must make such arrange
ments as to their numbers, and times of starting and
arrival, shall meet the convenience of the public; nor
may they alter these arrangements capriciously, or with
out due notice (a).
Besides their obligations to the members of the company,
and to the public, there is a third class of duties devolving
upon the directors in relation to Government, to the com
mittee of the privy council appointed to superintend rail
ways, to county and parochial officers, and others, which
deserve a brief notice. And first, they must give due
notice of the opening of the line, and permit inspection
thereof by the proper officer (b); they must provide duly
for the conveyance of the mails, under the direction of the
Postmaster-general (c), and for the conveyance of military
and police, public stores, and the like, at the command of
the Secretary-at-war (d). So they must permit the govern
ment to lay down and use electrical telegraphs upon the
line, and, under certain restrictions, permit their user by
the public (e). So they must keep full and true accounts

of all moneys received and paid by the company, and send
a copy of the balance-sheet, duly audited, to the Lords of
the Treasury, at the times prescribed (a). So they must
prepare an annual statement of all such accounts; and, if
required, transmit a copy of the same, free of charge, to
the overseers of the poor of the several parishes, and the
clerks of the peace of the several counties through which
the railway passes.
It will be their duty also to give notices to the Commis
sioners of Railways of all serious accidents occurring on the
line (b), and to make an annual return thereof, as pre
scribed; and also a return of traffic and of tolls (c); and
to submit, from time to time, to the Commissioners of Rail
ways all such bye-laws as may be enacted by them in
relation to any persons other than their own servants (d).
(g) Liabilities The directors incur no personal liability, as such, on any
'" contract entered into by them on the part of the company,

nor can they be sued or prosecuted individually or collect
ively for any lawful exercise of their powers; nor will their
bodies, goods, or lands, be liable to execution of any legal
process in respect of any contract made on behalf of the
company (e). Moreover, the directors, their heirs, execu
tors, and administrators, are entitled to be indemnified out
of the capital of the company for all payments made, or
liabilitiesincurred, in respect of any acts done by them, and
for all losses, costs, and damages which they may incur in
the execution of the powers granted to them; and for this
object they may appropriate the funds of the company (if
any) in their hands, or make calls of the capital remaining
unpaid (f).
The protection thus given to directors is given only in
cases in which there has been a lawful exercise of their
powers. If the act done was within the scope of their
authority, they are protected by the above provisions from
(a) 7 & 8 Vic, c. 85, s. 5. (b) 5 & 6 Wic, c. 55, s. 7.

the consequences of it; but if they have exceeded the
limits of that authority, by entering into contracts, or exe
cuting instruments, which they were not authorised to
make, they will be liable individually; for then the thing
done could not be said to be done on behalf of the com
pany, or to be a lawful act done in the execution of their
powers; it being an act beyond their powers, and therefore
unlawful. Hence, in such cases, third parties may have a
personal remedy against the directors, and none against
the company.
So if directors invest the funds of the company in any
other than government securities, having no express
authority to that effect, and any loss arise in consequence,
they will be liable individually to make it good. So in
case of any other improper employment of the company’s
capital, they will be responsible to make good the loss if
any should occur, or to account for the profits if any should
be made; or as in other cases where trustees make use of
the money belonging to their cestuis qui trusts.
Nor does it seem necessary that there should have
been any fraud in the matter thus involving personal
responsibility. A mistake as to the scope of their au
thority may lead directors into contracts and engage
ments which will not bind the company, and upon
which they will be individually liable. So where a direc
tor involves himself in obligations as regards the com
pany, though in the capacity of trustee for the general
body of the shareholders, he will be personally liable
for these engagements, if they were beyond the scope
of his official authority. Therefore where certain mem
bers of a board of directors for the purpose of com
pleting the subscription in compliance with the standing
orders of Parliament, signed the subscription-contract for
a large number of shares, and at the same time executed a
deed of trust of them; it was held on a bill filed by some
of the shareholders, complaining of the non-payment of
the calls upon those shares, that the parties were bound to

pay them, notwithstanding the deed of trust had been
subsequently annulled at a general meeting of the com
pany, and a resolution passed that the shares should be
transferred to the secretary (a).
If, however, the transaction in question were one which
it was competent for the directors to engage in, however
indiscreetly and improperly (no fraud being imputed) it
may have been managed, still it will bind the company,
whose agents for that purpose the directors were. Even a
fraudulent and corrupt management of business which
they were competent to transact, would not render them
liable to third parties, however they might expose them
selves to proceedings in Equity, at the suit of the share
holders. The directors of a railay company would seem
to be the general agents of the company, and to have the
same rights, liabilities, and immunities, as attach to that
class of persons, in ordinary cases (b).
Directors are also liable to the shareholders for fraud,
misconduct, or gross mismanagement in transacting the
affairs of the company. For further information on this
subject, see post, Book on Remedies.
A concurrence of the majority of shareholders will
frequently be deemed such a ratification of proceedings
not strictly justifiable on the part of the directors, as to
preclude the minority from objecting, provided such pro
ceedings were voidable only, and not void (c).
The Board of Directors may hold their meetings when
and where they choose to appoint, and may adjourn from
time to time as they think proper. Any two of the direc
tors may also at any time require the secretary to call a
meeting of the whole Board (d).

To constitute a meeting, the prescribed quorum, or, if
mone be prescribed, at least one-third of the directors
must be present (a).
At these meetings, all questions are to be determined by
the majority of votes of the directors present; or if the
division be equal, the chairman may give a casting vote in
addition to his vote as one of the directors.
At the first meeting held after the passing of the Special
Act, and at the first meeting after each annual election of
directors, the board are to choose one of their number for
their chairman, during the year ensuing; and may also, if
they think right, elect another director to officiate as
deputy chairman. If either of these officers die, resign,
or become disqualified or incapable to act during the year,
the directors at the meeting held next after the occurrence
of the vacancy may elect another of their number to fill it,
and the person so elected will continue in office so long as
the individual whose place he supplies would have been
entitled to remain (b). In the absence both of the chair
man and deputy-chairman, the directors must elect an
occasional chairman to preside (c).
The directors may appoint committees of their number,
consisting of so many members as are prescribed, or if no
number be prescribed, so many as they shall think fit, to
do any business on behalf of the company which the
board are empowered to do and may think proper to en
trust to them. The same rules prevail as to meetings,
adjournments, quorum, and voting, in respect of these
committees as in respect of the board of directors (d).
By the 98th section of the Companies’ Clauses Act it is
provided that “the directors shall cause notes, minutes, or
copies, as the case may require, of all appointments made,
or contracts entered into by the directors, and of the
orders and proceedings of all meetings of the company,
and of the directors and committees of directors, to be

the contrary be proved.”
Under similar clauses in Railway Acts it has been held,
in repeated instances, that the signature of the chairman at
a subsequent meeting (he having also presided at the former)
at which the minutes of the former were read over and
confirmed, was a sufficient compliance with the Act (a).
And where a Railway Act directed that the orders and
proceedings of every meeting of the company should be
entered in a book kept for that purpose,and should be signed
by the chairman at such meetings; and when so entered
and signed, as also the minutes and entries thereinafter
provided to be kept, should be deemed original orders and

in all Courts, etc., without proof of such meeting having
been duly convened, etc., and that the directors should
keep a regular minute and entry of the orders and pro

signed by the chairman at each respective meeting; it was
held that the signature of the minutes by the chairman

By the 99th section of the Companies’ Clauses Act it is
provided, that all acts done by the directors, or commit
tees ofdirectors, shall be valid, notwithstanding any defect
which may be afterwards discovered in the appointment
of any one or more of them; or although it should turn
out that any of them were disqualified from acting in that
character. Nor will the Court listen with indulgence to
objections of this nature, but will see that they be taken
in proper time, and in such form, as the rules of pleading
require (a). Nor will they, in general, inquire into the
validity of the appointment of directors on summary appli

SEC. II.–Meetings.
THE provisions of the Companies’ Clauses Act in respect
of general meetings of a railway company, are contained
in clauses 66 to 80, both inclusive. These meetings are
either ordinary, or extraordinary. We shall briefly exa
mine the enactments in respect of each.
The first general meeting of the company (if no time
be prescribed) must be held within one month of the time
of the passing of the Special Act; and the future general
meetings (if no periods be prescribed) in the months of
February and August in each year; or at such other
stated periods as shall be fixed by an order of a general

meeting. The place of such meetings if not prescribed
may be determined by the board of directors (a).
Fourteen days’ public notice, at the least, of all meet
ings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, must be given
by advertisement, specifying the place, day, and hour of
meeting; and if it be an extraordinary meeting, or an
ordinary meeting, at which it is proposed to bring forward
some business other than that which by the Special Act,
or the Companies’ Clauses Act, is appointed to be trans
acted thereat, the notice must specify the purpose for
which the meeting is called.
In order that the proceedings and measures of the com
pany may be the result of sufficient deliberation, and that
a general meeting may not be surprised or betrayed into
taking any steps of importance without having the oppor
tunity both for consideration and discussion; it is pro
vided, that no business, other than that appointed by the
Companies’ Clauses Act, or by the Special Act, to be done
at an ordinary meeting can be brought forward, unless
special notice of such business shall have been given in
the advertisement convening the meeting (c).
In order to prevent measures being passed without the
consent of a sufficient meeting of shareholders fairly to
represent, both in numbers and interest, the general body;
it is provided, that (if no particular quorum be prescribed
by the Special Act,) then there must be present, per
sonally, or by proxy, in order to constitute a general
meeting (ordinary or extraordinary), shareholders holding
in the aggregate not less than one twentieth of the capital
of the company, and being in number not less than one
for every five hundred pounds of such required proportion
of capital, unless such number would be more than
twenty, in which case twenty shareholders, holding not
less than one twentieth of the capital of the company,

shall be the quorum. Hence no general meeting of a
railway company (ordinary or extraordinary) is properly
constituted unless there be present at least twenty share
holders, who shall represent at least one twentieth of the
capital. Proxies, however, are included in the enume
ration.
If within one hour from the time appointed for the
meeting, a quorum be not present, no business can be
transacted, except declaring a dividend (if that be one of
the objects of the meeting), but the meeting shall be
deemed to be adjourned sine die; except in the case of a
meeting for the election of directors, when the meeting
will stand adjourned to the following day, at the same
place and hour, for that purpose; and if a quorum be not
then present within the hour, that meeting will also be
deemed adjourned sine die (a).
The chairman of the board of directors, or, in his ab
sence, the deputy-chairman, or, in the absence of both,
some one of the directors to be elected by the meeting; or,
if no director be present, then one of the shareholders to
be chosen by a majority of those present, is to preside as
chairman of the meeting (b).
The shareholders present at a general meeting are to
proceed in execution of the powers of the company, in
respect of those matters for which the meeting was con
vened, and for those only; and every such meeting may
be adjourned from time to time, and from place to place,
but no business can be transacted at any such adjourned
meeting, other than that left unfinished at the meeting
from which such adjournment took place (c).
All questions properly brought before a general meet
ing of the company are to be decided either by an actual
majority of votes, or by the particular majority required
in relation to any special matter. But in order to protect

a company from the overwhelming influence of large
capitalists, who may hold a very great number of the
shares, and thus represent a considerable proportion of
the capital, a graduated scale of voting is prescribed by
the Companies' Clauses Act, which diminishes the influ
ence of the holder of shares, in respect of those beyond a
certain number, according to a fixed rate: and the same
object is aimed at, in requiring at a valid meeting of the
company, not only the representatives of a certain pro
portion of the capital, but also a certain definite number
of individual shareholders, either in person, or by their
proxies. On this subject it is provided, that if no scale of
voting at general meetings be prescribed by the Special
Act, the 8 Vic. c. 16 enacts, that every shareholder shall
have one vote for every share up to ten, and an additional
vote for every five shares beyond the first ten held by him
up to one hundred, and an additional vote for every ten
shares beyond the first hundred: provided always, that no
shareholder be entitled to vote at any meeting, unless he
shall have paid up all the calls then due upon all the shares
held by him (a).
Where several persons are jointly entitled to a share,
the person whose name stands first in the register, as the
holder of the share, will be entitled to vote as the sole
proprietor, either personally, or by proxy, and his vote
will be allowed as the vote in respect of that share, with
out proof of the concurrence of the other holders (b).
Any shareholder being a lunatic, idiot, or minor, may
vote by his committee or guardian, either in person, or by
proxy (c).
Annexed to the Companies’ Clauses Act, is a form to be
adopted in the appointment of a proxy. This must be in
writing, and under the hand of the shareholder making
the appointment, or if such shareholder be a corporation,

under the common seal of the corporation (a). Guardians,
and committees of lunatics and minors, may also execute
such an instrument (b). This document, in order to en
title the appointee to vote under it, must, if no other time
be prescribed, be transmitted to the secretary of the com
pany not less than forty-eight hours before the time ap
pointed for holding the meeting at which such proxy is to be
used (c). By the schedule to the statute 7 and 8 Vict. c. 21,
a duty of two shillings and sixpence is imposed for and in
respect of every letter or power of attorney, or other in
strument made for the sole purpose of appointing or nomi
nating a proxy, to vote at any meeting of the proprietors
of any joint stock company whose capital is divided into
shares, and transferable. It is also provided in the body
of the Act (sec. 6) that the instrument so subject to duty
shall specify the time of holding the mecting at which it
authorises the proxy to vote; and that it shall avail for
that purpose at such meeting, and at any adjournment
thereof, but not further, or otherwise. Other sections of
the Act impose penalties on persons making or signing
such an instrument, or voting or attempting to vote under
it, if it be not properly stamped; and make all votes, or
other acts done in pursuance of it, absolutely null and void,
to all intents and purposes. None but shareholders of the
company can be proxies; as none others are entitled to
be present at the meeting (d).
All questions are to be decided by a majority of the
votes of the parties present, including proxies; and in case
of an equality of votes, the chairman will be entitled, in
addition to his vote as principal, or proxy, to give a casting
vote (e).
In cases where, by the Companies’ Clauses Act, or the
Special Act, a particular majority of votes is required to
authorise any proceeding, it will not be necessary to prove

that particular majority, unless a poll be demanded; and
if a poll be not demanded, the declaration of the chairman
that the resolution has been carried, and an entry to that
effect in the book of proceedings, will be deemed sufficient
evidence of the fact, without proof of the number or pro
portion of votes recorded in favour of or against the pro
position in question (a).
The directors may be required by twenty or more share
holders, holding not less than one-tenth of the capital of
the company (unless some other number be prescribed by
the Special Act), on receiving a written request to that
effect, to call an extraordinary meeting of the company.
The requisition must fully set forth the object of the pro
posed meeting, and must be left at the office of the com
pany, or served upon at least three directors; and on the
receipt of it, the directors must forthwith convene a
general meeting. If, for twenty-one days after receiving
the notice, the directors neglect to call the meeting, the
shareholders who have signed the requisition may do so,
on giving fourteen days’ public notice thereof, as men
tioned above. Care must be taken that the notice specify
precisely the purpose for which the meeting is called, and
the business proposed to be transacted (b).
Before dismissing the subject of meetings, it may be
right to mention that the powers of the company in gene
ral meeting assembled being very large, and, in relation
to its general business and affairs, supreme; all differences
as to the mode of conducting those affairs should be dis
cussed at either an ordinary or extraordinary meeting of
the shareholders. This is the tribunal to which the board
of directors should be brought for alleged misconduct or
mismanagement; nor can dissentient members of the
company appeal to a court of justice in relation to mere

body, nor ask the court to review or arrange their pecu
niary matters and accounts. But where the hostile and
irregular proceedings of directors have brought the com
pany into such a state of confusion as virtually amounts
to a disorganisation, and the members generally are un
able, by any course to be adopted among themselves, to
restore a good understanding, or where the directors act
directly in defiance of the general wishes of the share
holders, lawfully expressed, or in opposition to the provi
sions of the Act, the Courts of Law and Equity would
interfere, to restrain or enforce by injunction or manda
mus, as the circumstances of the case might require (a).
SEC. III.—Officers.
IT will not be necessary in this section to enumerate all
the various officers of a railway company, or to attempt
any accurate and specific account of the duties of those of
whom we shall treat. It is obviously impracticable to de
scribe the many obligations devolving upon such persons.
We propose only to allude briefly to the secretary, the
treasurer, and the auditors, for the purpose of indicating
generally the nature and extent of their respective
duties.

Secretary.

Duties.
(1) The Secretary.
This officer is appointed, and may be dismissed, by the
board of directors. He is the principal agent of the com
pany, and the one through whom nearly all their business
is transacted. Although the appointment of the secretary
is vested in the managing body, yet the amount of remu
neration to be paid to him is to be determined by the com
pany in general meeting assembled (a).
The duties of the secretary and of those appointed to
assist him in his office, include all the correspondence of
the company with individuals and other companies, the
keeping of the register of shareholders, of memorials of
transfers, of certificates and substituted certificates, of the
declarations required in certain cases of transfer of shares
by act and operation of law, of loan notes, mortgages,
and bonds, and generally of the accounts of the company,
both receipts and expenditure. The secretary also calls
the meetings of the directors, and signs all notices and
advertisements convening the general meetings, ordinary
and extraordinary, of the company, and all documents
requiring their authentication.
Although we have said that the secretary is the agent
of the company, yet he is only so ministerially, or as the
servant of the directors, and for the purpose of executing
their orders, and, except in certain specified instances, he
does not fill (as does the board of directors) a representa
tive capacity, wielding the authority of others in their
names. No power is delegated to him, but he is appointed
simply for the purpose of obeying the orders given to
him. Hence he cannot bind either the directors or the
company by any contract which he may make, except in
relation to such matters as are of too trivial a character
and too frequentoccurrence to require the express sanction
of the board (b). But he would be personally liable to the
(a) 8 Vic, c. 16, s. 19. (b) See post, Ch. on Contracts.
CHAP. 1.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND Gov ERNMENT. 449
other contracting party upon any such unauthorised con
tract.
The secretary, if he be entrusted to any extent with the
custody and control of monies, may be required, before
entering on his office, to give security to the company (a).
He must also be prepared to render up his accounts at the
request of the directors, together with all necessary
vouchers and receipts, and to pay any balance which may
be due from him to the company (b).
If, for three days after a request by the directors, the
secretary refuse to pay any balance due to the company,
the latter may have a summary remedy before two justices
by warrant of distress, or imprisonment not exceeding
three months (c); and if he refuse to give up the papers
and documents in his possession relating to the business
and affairs of the company, two justices may commit him
to prison until he does so (d). Any intention to abscond
may be defeated by a warrant, and, on appearance, he
may, in default of bail, be committed to gaol (e). Such
summary proceedings, however, will not deprive the di
rectors of any remedy which they may otherwise have
against such officer or his sureties (f).
(2) The Treasurer.
With regard to the obligation to appoint a party to
act as treasurer, and the mode in which that appoint
ment should be made, the Companies’ Clauses Act is
silent. It would appear, therefore, as if the appointment
were entirely optional on the part of the managing body.
But the frequent mention of such an officer in the various
Railway Acts, leads necessarily to the inference that such
an appointment was contemplated. Thus we find that
the treasurer must give, and the directors are bound to
require, sufficient security for the due performance of his

duties (a). That the amount of his remuneration must be
settled by a general meeting of the shareholders (b). That
in the case of a sale by the company of shares forfeited for
non-payment of calls, the receipt of the purchase-money
by the treasurer shall be evidence of title in the purchaser
(c). That in case of the insolvency or bankruptcy of any
person against whom the company have any claim, the
treasurer or secretary may represent the company, and
may act in all respects as if such claim had been the claim
of the treasurer or secretary, and not of the company (d).
That summonses, notices, and other documents re
quiring authentication, may be signed by the directors,
treasurer, or secretary, and need not be under the common
seal of the company (e); and that whenever any damages,
costs, or expenses are directed, either by the Special or
General Railway Acts, to be paid by the company, and
sufficient goods of the company cannot be found whereon
to levy such damages, costs, and expenses, the same may,
if the amount do not exceed £20, be recovered by distress
of the goods of the treasurer; but no such distress may
issue against his goods unless seven days’ notice, stating
the amount due, and demanding payment thereof, have
been given to him or left at his residence; and that the
treasurer paying any money under such distress may re
tain the amount so paid by him, and all costs and expenses
occasioned thereby, out of any moneys belonging to the
company coming into his custody or control; or he may sue
the company for the same (f).
From reference to the above-mentioned clauses, it is
clear that the office of a treasurer is contemplated; but as
the mode of appointing him is not prescribed, we may
conclude that the power of appointment and dismissal is
vested in the board of directors, although the amount

of remuneration is to be settled by the shareholders in
public meeting assembled (a).
It is the duty of the treasurer to take care of all moneys
committed to his charge, or received by him on account of
the company, and, when required by the directors to
make out and deliver to them, or to any person appointed
by them, a true and correct account in writing under his
hand, of all moneys received by him on behalf of the com
pany, showing how and for what purposes the moneys
shall have been disposed of; and, together with such ac
count, he must, if requested, give up all vouchers and
receipts for payments made by him, and pay over all
moneys which may be owing to the company upon the ba
lance of account (b).
Should he neglect or refuse to deliver such accounts, he
will be liable to the same proceedings, either summary,
before two justices, or by action against him and his
sureties, as are prescribed in the case of the secretary
making similar default (c).
(3) The Auditors.
In order to secure an accurate keeping of the accounts,
and an honest and faithful disposal of the funds of a
company, certain officers, called auditors, must be ap
pointed by the shareholders, at the first general meeting
after the passing of the Act, in the same manner as is
provided for the election of directors. The number of
auditors, if not otherwise prescribed in the Special Act,
is fixed in the Companies’ Clauses Consolidation Act (d).
The qualification of a party to become an auditor is
(unless otherwise determined in the Special Act), the pos
session of at least one share in the undertaking; and he
must neither hold any office in the company, nor be in
any way interested in its concerns, except as a share

holder (a). The remarks hereinbefore made with regard
to the disqualification of directors, apply in the case of
auditors, and it is therefore unnecessary to repeat them
in this place (b).
One of the auditors (to be determined in the first in
stance by ballot amongst themselves, unless they shall
otherwise agree,—and afterwards by seniority) is to go
out of office at the first ordinary meeting in each year,
and the retiring auditor will be immediately eligible for
re-election; and, after any such re-election, he will, with
respect to the going out of office by rotation, be deemed
a new auditor. The failure of any meeting at which an
auditor should have been elected, is provided for as in the
case of directors (c).
The appointment of a new auditor in case of death,
resignation, or disqualification, is vested in the share
holders, who, in any general meeting, may, if they think
fit, elect one of their body to fill up the vacancy (d).
It is the duty of the auditors to receive from the direc
tors, and the directors are required to give to them, at
least fourteen days before each ordinary meeting, the half
yearly or other periodical accounts, and balance sheet, re
quired to be presented to the shareholders; and to exa
mine the same, and ascertain the correctness thereof (e);
and for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of such
balance sheet, they are empowered, if they think fit, at
the expense of the company, to employ accountants and
such other persons as may be necessary (f).
The auditors may either make a special report on the
accounts delivered to them, or simply confirm the same.
Such report or confirmation must be read, together with
the report of the directors, at the ensuing ordinary meet.

C H A PTER II.
AS TO CAPITAL.
WE propose in this chapter to treat first of shares, then of
calls, then of dividends, and lastly of loans, or the borrowed
capital of a railway company.
SEC. I.—Shares.
(1) Nature of
THE interest in the fixed and floating property of a rail
way company, that is to say, in the capital expended in
the formation of the line, and in the purchase of the plant
necessary for working it, is divided into a certain number
of shares of a given amount; the amount of the capital,
the number of shares, and the value of the shares re
spectively are fixed by the Special Act (a). For the
purpose of distinguishing every share, and ascertaining
both the rights and liabilities of any person in respect of
the ownership thereof, the shares must be numbered in
arithmetical progression, beginning with number one, and
every share must be distinguished by its appropriate
number (b). For this purpose the company are required
to keep a book to be called the register of shareholders,
in which are to be entered from time to time in alpha
betical order the names of the shareholders with the
number of shares belonging to each, the distinguishing
number of each share, and the amount of subscription
paid thereon. This registry must be authenticated by the
seal of the company, at the first ordinary meeting after

Shares.
Number of.

454 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v.
the passing of the Special Act, and so from time to time
at each successive ordinary meeting (a).
In addition to the registry of shareholders, a book, to
be called the shareholders address book, must be kept, in
which the names, descriptions, and addresses of every
shareholder must be entered in alphabetical order, and
which book may be perused free of charge at all reason
able times by any shareholder of the company, who may
have a copy of the same or any part thereof at a charge
not exceeding sixpence for every one hundred words (b).
Railway shares It is expressly provided in the Companies’ Clauses Act,
:". that shares in a railway company shall be deemed personal
property, and shall be transmissible as such, and shall not
be deemed to be of the nature of real estate (c). This
enactment entirely settles the dispute as to whether pro
perty in a railway company is realty or personalty; and puts
an end to all the difficulties which attach to that question.
Generally, where money is expended in the improve
ment of real property, it is converted into and becomes of
the same nature as the property upon which it has been
laid out; consequently, in the absence of any enactment to
the effect of the above, shares or interests in a railway or
canal company would be considered real estate (d).
And pass to As shares in a railway company are personal property, all
: the legal incidents of that class of property attach to them.
Therefore, where the proprietor becomes bankrupt, they
will pass as personalty to his assignees (e); and they will
also be considered “goods and chattels” within the mean
ing of that section of the Bankrupt Act (f) relating to
reputed ownership (g). So, where certain formalities are
prescribed for the transfer of shares, although they may
have been sold by the bankrupt previous to an Act of Bank
ruptcy, it has been held that they are to be considered as

remaining in his order and disposition, unless the transfer
shall have been made and registered in the manner pointed
out by the Act. Nor will a transfer by the delivery of
certificates, or in any other than the prescribed manner,
avail to pass any property in the shares, or be held to
constitute an equitable mortgage, as against the as
signees of a bankrupt proprietor (a). Although, in one
case, where a shareholder borrowed money on the de
posit of the certificates of his shares, with assignments
executed by him, but with the name of the transferree left
in blank, and the blanks were not filled up before the
shareholder became bankrupt; it was held that the equit
able mortgagee had a lien on the shares, and that the lien
extended to sums paid by him in respect of calls (b). It is
difficult to reconcile the judgment in the case last cited with
that in the former, or with the principles laid down in
Hebblewhite v.McMorine (c), and Humble v. Langston (d),
where it was held that no interest passed except under a
transfer in compliance with the Act.
Although, however, shares in a railway company have
been held to fall within the meaning of the words
“goods and chattels,” in the Bankrupt Act, yet it would
seem that they are not comprised under the terms “goods,
wares, and merchandise,” in the Statute of Frauds, and
will not, therefore, come within the operation of the 17th
section of that statute. Nevertheless, as they are per
sonal estate, and not an interest in lands, they are ex
empted also from the provisions ofthe 4th section; so that
any contract for the sale or purchase ofthem maybe byparol,
and need not be in writing (e). As another consequence
of the personal nature of property in a company, we may
mention that in the case of the marriage of a female share
holder, the shares belonging to her will be choses in action

which will belong and survive to her, unless the husband
reduce them into possession in his lifetime; and if he sur
vive her, he could not acquire a right to them unless he took
out letters of administration to his wife for that purpose.
To effect a reduction of them into possession during
the life-time of the wife, it is necessary for the husband to
comply with the provisions of the Companies’ Clauses
Act made in that behalf(a), which require that a declar
ation in writing should be made before a justice, or master,
or master extraordinary in Chancery, stating the manner
in which, and the party to whom the shares shall have
been transmitted, and containing a copy of the register of
the marriage, or other particulars of the celebration thereof,
and a declaration of the identity of the wife with the holder
of the shares.
£ : Again, shares in a company will devolve to his personal
out for. representative on the death of the owner, and probate or
letters of administration must be taken out in respect
of them, and they will be liable to probate and legacy
duty, as other personal property. So they may be made
the subject of specific bequest; in which case if the
whole amount due upon the shares be not paid up at the
time of the testator's decease, the legatee will be entitled
to have the remaining calls, as they come due, paid out
of his estate (b). So any contingent advantages in the
shape of new shares, or otherwise, would fall to the legatee
of the original shares; but the calls in respect of such
new shares would not be payable out of the estate of the
testator (c).
So they will be deemed bona notabilia in the province or
diocese through which the line of the railway passes; and
it has been held that mandamus will lie against the
company, compelling them to make an entry of the pro
bate or letters of administration of a deceased proprietor,
and to register the executor or administrator as pro
prietor of the shares in the company belonging to the de

ceased (a). Where the railway passes through the two pro
vinces or through several dioceses probate or letters of ad
ministration must be taken out where the principal office of
the company is situate (b); if the company have offices in
two dioceses, it would appear that probate or letters of
administration granted in either, would be sufficient (c).
Shares in a railway company belonging to any party, or
standing in the name of some other person in trust for any
such party, against whom judgment shall have been entered
up in any of the superior Courts at Westminster, may, by
order of a judge of one of such Courts, be charged with the
payment of the amount of the judgment debt and inte
rest; and such order, after the expiration of six calendar
months from the date thereof, will entitle the judgment
creditor to the same remedies as he would have been
entitled to if the charge had been made in his favour
by the judgment debtor (d). The order so made by
a judge, will operate as a distringas after notice to the
company (e); and if after such notice, the company permit
the debtor to transfer the shares, they will be liable to the
judgment creditor in an action for damages to the amount
of their value, or to attachment for contempt of the Court
whose order they have disobeyed; the creditor, however,
will have the advantage of his distringas, if, without having
realised the security for his debt, he issue execution
against the person of his debtor (f).

sum, or upwards, to the capital of the company, or shall

holders, shall be deemed a shareholder of the com
pany (a). |
By subscrip- This section contemplates the existence of a right in any
tion. party to a share in a railway company, as arising in one of
two ways; first, from the fact of his having originally sub
scribed for a certain portion of the capital proposed to be
raised, and either never having parted with the interest
so acquired; or having parted with it before the Act was
obtained, the company have not adopted his assignee as
a shareholder in his stead, but have registered him for
the number of shares for which he subscribed: secondly,
from the fact of the party having purchased scrip of an
original subscriber, before the passing of the Act, and after
it was obtained, having procured himself to be registered
for the shares represented by it in the place of the origi
mal subscriber; or from the fact of his being the assignee or
transferee of a registered shareholder, the transfer of the
shares having been effected in the form prescribed by
law in that behalf, and a memorial thereof having been
By purchase of duly registered in the books of the company. It is right,
'' perhaps, to mention that in addition to the above, there
is another mode of becoming a shareholder in a company,
namely, by purchase from the company of shares forfeited
for non-payment of calls, which, under the provisions of
the Companies’ Clauses Act (b), they are empowered to
sell, either by public auction or private contract.
As to the mode of acquiring shares by marriage, death,
bankruptcy, etc., the reader is referred to those subjects
under the section “Transfer of Shares.” (c)
Shares in As shares in a railway company are frequently registered
trust. in the names of parties who hold them in trust for others,
it may be well to observe here, that the company are not
bound to notice any trusts, either express, implied, or con
structive, to which such shares may be subject whether
they have had notice of such trusts or not; the receipt of

the party in whose name the shares stand is a sufficient dis
charge to them for any dividend or sum payable, nor are
they bound to see to the application of the money paid upon
such receipt (a). Yet although as between the company and
the party on the register notice of a trust is inoperative,
and will not oblige the company to recognise its existence;
still it may be important in order to protect the interest of
the objects of the trust in certain cases, and defeat the
claims ofthird parties, to give notice to the secretary. Thus,
where shares are registered in the name of one person in
trust for some other, and no notice of the trust has been
given, on the bankruptcy of the party in whose name they
stand they will pass to his assignees (b). So where the
owner of shares by a voluntary settlement assigned them to
a trustee for the life of the settlor, and then over to another
party, but neglected to have such transmission of interest
authenticated in proper manner, and notice thereof given
to the company; it was held that the trusts were inopera
tive, and that on the death of the settlor no interest having
passed by the settlement, the shares in question went to
the personal representative, and not to the party named in
remainder (c).
It would appear from the eighth section of the Compa
nies’ Clauses Act (quoted above), that a party to be en
titled to any share or profit in the company must have
been entered on the register of shareholders; although it
has been decided on the construction of Special Acts
containing clauses similar to the one under consideration,
that the entry of the name of a party on the register
of shareholders is not necessary to render him liable to
pay calls as a shareholder, provided that if by sending in
scrip, and claiming to be registered in respect thereof, or
by doing any other act acknowledging that he is a share
holder, he had precluded himself from taking advantage

of the objection that his name was not entered on the
register (c).
Hence we may perhaps infer by parity of reasoning,
that if the liability of a shareholder may attach in cer
tain cases to a party whose name is not on the register,
the rights of that character would also belong to him.
Inasmuch, however, as it is generally necessary, and
always desirable that owners of shares should be entered
as such on the register of shareholders, we shall proceed
to inquire, what parties can claim to have their names
inserted in such register. And, first, there can be no
doubt that those who originally subscribed for certain
shares in the undertaking have such a right, provided
they make their claim to be registered within such time
after the Act of Incorporation has been obtained, as has
been fixed for the registration of the scrip. This time is
determined either by the terms of the subscribers’ agree
ment, or by a resolution of the Board of Directors after
incorporation, of which due notice must be given.
So also an original subscriber who has parted with his
scrip, but whose assignee has not been registered in re
spect of such scrip, and who has been compelled by the
company to pay calls on the shares for which he sub
scribed, will be entitled to be registered as a shareholder
in respect thereof, although the scrip certificates be not
produced. For these certificates are only evidence of title
to the shares, and the company by electing to enforce his
liability upon them is precluded from disputing the owner
ship, which is the ground and reason of that liability.
Any question as to the right of the scrip-holder, in such
case the parties must settle among themselves; nor can the
company set up any outstanding right of ownership of the
scripholder against the original subscriber who has been
compelled to pay calls.

The transferree, or representative of any party duly Transferrees of
registered, has also a right to be registered as a share- £"
holder, provided that where the transmission of interest
takes place by death, marriage, or bankruptcy, the mode
in which such interest has been transmitted be evidenced
in the manner prescribed by the Companies’ Clauses Act;
and that in case ofthe purchase of a share the deed of trans
fer be duly executed and lodged with the secretary in con
formity with its provisions, and all calls then due upon the
shares standing in the name of the vendor had been paid
at the time when the transfer was effected; a shareholder
not being entitled to transfer any share until the calls for
the time being due on all his shares shall have been paid.
It must be observed, that the right to a share and to the
benefits arising therefrom, either in the shape of new shares
or other contingent advantages, does not accrue from the
time that the party has his name entered in the registry of
shareholders, but from the time when, having complied
with the formula prescribed by the Companies’ Clauses
Act, he becomes entitled to have his name entered thereon.
This is of importance, as in practice it frequently happens
that owing to the omission of the secretary or other
servant of the company, the name of a party is not entered
in the registry until some time after the deed of transfer
has been lodged at the office of the company, in which case
the party who has transferred his interest, and received the
consideration for it, still remaining on the registry, would
appear prima facie to be entitled to all the benefits, as well
as exposed to the liabilities of a shareholder. Where the
statute directed that a deed of transfer should be kept by

Scripholders.
Parties becoming the owners of shares in any of the
modes above-mentioned will be entitled as a matter of
course to be registered and admitted to the privileges of
shareholders in the company, and it would seem that no
discretion is left with the company to reject them; and
that if they refuse to enter the name of a person so en
titled on the register, or to admit him to the rights and
privileges incidental to the position of a shareholder, we
are of opinion, that the party prejudiced by such refusal,
may have a remedy by writ of mandamus against the
company, to compel them to register him (a).
There is, however, another class of persons, namely,
those who have purchased scrip certificates, whose right
against the company to be admitted as shareholders seems
questionable, although from the judgment of Mr. Baron
Parke in Daly v. Thompson (b), it would appear, that on de
ducing his title correctly from an original subscriber, an
action at the suit of the holder of scrip certificates would
lie against the company for refusing to register him.
Still it would impose a great hardship on companies
formed of subscribers of substance, to be compelled to
register parties incompetent to pay the calls on their
shares, and between whom and the company there is no
privity of contract. For, inasmuch as the registration of
the scripholder as owner of certain shares, releases the
subscriber for those shares from his covenant in respect
of them, to admit the right of scripholders to registration
as such, with no power on the part of the company to
reject their claims, is to encourage original subscribers to
evade the responsibilities consequent on their subscrip
tion, by substituting persons unable to meet the liabilities
incidental to the proprietorship of shares.
The company may, however, elect to adopt a scripholder
as the owner of the shares represented by his scrip cer

tificates; and, if they do so, and enforce his liability upon
them, he will be clearly entitled to registration as a share
holder; as the company will be estopped, by their own
acts and conduct, from disputing the rights of that relation
which they have compelled the scripholder to assume, on
the same principle which fixes the latter with liability
when he has chosen to send in his certificates claiming to
be registered (a).
Before dismissing this subject it may be observed, that
if an original subscriber tender his scrip shares for regis
tration, and it be refused on the ground that the register
is full, he will be entitled to a remedy against the com
pany; unless the register has been properly filled. Thus, if
there has been a fraudulent issue of scrip certificates, the
holders of which have been admitted to registration to
the exclusion of the original subscribers, or if the amount
of capital having been reduced in Parliament, the di
rectors do not fairly apportion the smaller amount
among the members; or if an amalgamation with another
company has been effected in such a way as to have
made a re-distribution of shares necessary, and this has
not been done equitably, and thereby an original sub
scriber is precluded from registering, on the ground that
the number of shares authorised by the Act are already
on the register; he might sue the directors for mis
management (b).
Where a party in possession of scrip certificates holds
back, and neglects to send them in for registration within
the time limited for that purpose, it may, perhaps, be a ques
tion, whether the directors will be justified in completing
the registry of shareholders so long as such scrip remains

outstanding, without inserting the name of the subscriber
to whom it was originally allotted. It is clear that the
company have a right to register the latter for the number
of shares for which he has subscribed; and, perhaps, the
directors may lawfully decline (with the sanction of the
shareholders) to exercise that right; but whether they
can treat the shares belonging to such party as forfeited,
before default has been made in the payment of calls,
may be matter of question. The 9th section of the
Companies' Clauses Act makes it the duty of the com
pany to insert in the register of shareholders the names
of the parties entitled to shares, and, clearly, subscribers
are entitled to the shares for which they have subscribed,
provided no other persons producing the scrip have been
accepted by the company in their stead. It would seem,
therefore, that until default in the payment of calls, the
subscriber, although not coming in with his scrip, is en
titled to be considered a shareholder of the company, and,
as such, to have his name entered in the register of share
holders; at all events unless there was a covenant in the
subscriber's agreement to return the scrip for registration
on or before a given day.
Registration of a person as owner of shares is evidence
of his title, and in respect of the shares for which he is
registered, he will be held liable to the company for the pay
ment of calls, and will be entitled to dividends and profits.
But the fact, that the name of a person is entered on the
registry of shareholders, although primáfacie evidence of
his title to be considered a proprietor of the shares at
tached to his name, is, nevertheless, not conclusive evi
dence of that fact, but it may be rebutted by proof that
the shares have been legally transferred. So, also, a
person, whose name does not appear in the register, may
prove his title to have it entered thereon, by showing
a delivery to the secretary of the company of the deed of
transfer of the shares to which he claims to be entitled.
The right cf the party as against the company to be

deemed the owner of the shares in question, accrues from
the time when the deed of transfer is so delivered to the
secretary (a).
The provision under consideration, that the register
of shareholders is to be deemed primá facie evidence of
proprietorship, is not defeated, by some irregularity in
the mode of keeping the book, or of the entry of other
shareholders; nor will such irregularities vitiate the docu
ment as evidence against a shareholder (b). The enact

not essential; that is, if such entries are made bond fide,
and the book is substantially such as was by the Act
“directed to be kept,” it cannot be rejected as evidence
because there are errors in it. -

or insolvency of the owner, or, in case of a feme sole,
by her marriage, and reduction of them into possession
by her husband during the coverture.
These subjects will be treated more fully in a subse
quent part of this chapter (a).
Having shown how a party may become, and how he
may be proved to be, a shareholder in a railway company,
we shall now treat briefly, and generally, of the legal in
cidents of his relation both to the company and to third
parties. The principal rights and liabilities of share
holders will fall under consideration in detail under the
sections on dividends, calls, creation of new shares, &c.;
and all we propose here, therefore, is a general view of
their position and claims.
A shareholder in a railway company, after the Act
of Incorporation has been obtained, is no longer in the
situation of an ordinary partner in the undertaking, but
is rather a tenant in common of the corporate property,
and as such has merely an interest in the concern to the
extent of the shares he represents. On the one hand, he
cannot, as in cases of ordinary partnership, bind the other
shareholders by an individual act of his own, the direction
and management of the affairs of the company being, by
the Act of Incorporation, vested in the parties appointed
directors; whilst, on the other hand, he cannot be made
liable to the debts of the company to an extent greater
than the amount of his shares.
The shareholders of a company, who have paid up all
the calls then due upon their several shares, are at liberty
to attend and vote at all meetings of the company, ordi
nary and extraordinary, either personally, or by proxy.
So they may take part in the discussion of any business
brought forward; and may, after due notice given, origin
ate any motion which they may deem material for the in
terests of the company.

entitled to his proportion of dividends and profits declared
payable in respect of such shares. But no dividend is
payable in respect of any share, until all the calls due in
respect of that and every other share, owned by such
shareholder shall have been paid (a).
The shareholders are also entitled to claim, although To new shares.
not bound to take, their rateable proportion of any con
tingent advantage arising from the conversion of mort
gage and bond debts into stock; or by the creation of
new capital, which must, for that purpose, be divided into
shares of such amount as will conveniently allow the same
to be apportioned; and each person entitled to any such
apportionment, must, however, make his election to take
the same within a month after notice has been given to
him by the secretary (b).
A shareholder is also entitled, at such times as are To inspect
prescribed in the Special Act, to inspect all books con-"
taining accounts of the receipt and expenditure of monies
by the company; and if no times are prescribed, he is
at liberty to inspect them for fourteen days previous to,
or for one month subsequent to, every ordinary meeting.
For this purpose the company are bound to appoint a
book-keeper, who, for any refusal to permit inspection at
the appointed times, is liable to forfeit to the party
refused a sum not exceeding five pounds for every
offence (c).
But where a shareholder has neglected to avail himself
of the right thus secured to him, the Court will not assist
him in an effort to defeat an action brought against him
by the company. Therefore, where a defendant against
whom an action for calls had been commenced, applied to
the Court to order an inspection of the minute-book of

the directors, to enable him to ascertain whether there
were a competent body present to make the call in ques
tion; the Court refused, saying, “The object of giving an
inspection of documents, is not to enable a defendant to
fish out a defence from some defect in the proceedings, but,
if he have a defence, to assist him to ascertain how he may
be able properly to plead it” (a).
Nor will the Court grant a mandamus where liberty to
inspect has been refused, (although the Act of Incorpora
tion required that the books should be open at all reason
able times to the inspection of the proprietors,) unless at
the time the demand was made, the proprietor stated the
object for which he wanted the inspection (b).
A shareholder is also entitled to sell and transfer to a
third party, all or any of his shares in the undertaking,
together with all the rights and liabilities incident thereto,
provided that all calls then due upon the whole of the
shares standing in the name of such shareholder shall
have been paid, and that the deed of transfer be executed
in conformity with the regulations made in that behalf,
both by the Special Act, and by the Companies’ Clauses
Consolidation Act (c).
Although a party being a shareholder in a company
would be unable, previous to their incorporation, to sue
any of the directors in respect of any personal claim on
the company, as for work, labour, and services, on the
ground that he was a partner (d), yet on the passing of the
Act he would be entitled to maintain such an action; as
all money raised by the company, whether by subscription
of shareholders, or otherwise, must be applied first in pay
ment of the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining the

Special Act, and then in carrying into execution the
general purposes of the company (a).
So a shareholder may enter into any contract with the
company after Act obtained, or serve them in the ca
pacity of secretary, manager, engineer, or other officer,
and he will have the same rights and remedies against
the company as any other party not a shareholder; a
member of a corporation contracting with it being re
garded in respect of any such contract in the light of a
stranger, and as distinct from the corporate body to which
he belongs as any third person (b). An exception, how
ever, from this general rule must be made in the case of
the directors of the company, who are disqualified by spe
cial enactment (c), from entering into, or being concerned
with, or interested in, any contract with the company.
Among the general rights of shareholders, we may men

by him), (a) and until he has legally transferred his shares,
and the transfer has been deposited with the secretary of
the company, is liable to certain obligations which attach
upon him (or his personal representatives), (b) in that ca
pacity.
This liability is twofold: first, to the company; secondly,
to third parties. The liability to the company consists
chiefly in the obligation of every shareholder to the pay
ment of calls (c), on pain of being sued for the amount of
arrears, or of having his shares forfeited, if he neglect or
refuse to pay them (d).
The liability of individual shareholders in incorporated
companies to creditors of such companies is exceedingly
limited, and in no case direct. Parties contracting with a
company are not presumed to contract upon the individual
responsibility ofeach shareholder, but upon that ofthe com
pany. Consequently, although the legislature has given
to creditors in such cases certain remedies against the share
holders, it never allows legal proceedings to be taken in
the first instance against them, but requires that after the
company has been sued, execution should be issued to
satisfy the judgment against the property and effects of the
company; and if the corporate funds be insufficient, such
execution may be issued against any of the shareholders,
by order of the Court, and after notice to the party; but
then only to the extent of the unpaid proportion of capital
represented by the shares actually possessed by any such
shareholder.

previous to the passing of the 8 Vic. c. 16, there was no
individual responsibility thrown upon shareholders; and
the consequence was that where the funds of the company
had been entirely dissipated a creditor was left without
any remedy; but that Act, whilst, on the one hand, it
compels a creditor of any company falling within its
provisions to resort to the funds of the corporation in the
first instance; on the other hand, if such funds be found
insufficient, it gives him a remedy against individual share
holders, to the extent of the capital remaining unpaid upon
their shares, leaving them to their remedies against the
company. Hence the creditor, having exhausted the cor
porate property without full satisfaction of his claim, is not
obliged to proceed for the recovery of the remainder by
application to the Court for a mandamus to be issued to
the directors, compelling them to make a call sufficient to
meet his demand; but he may issue execution himself
against the shareholders whose shares are not fully paid up.
Certain formalities, however, are prescribed, and certain
preliminaries must be observed, when a shareholder is to
be made liable to a creditor of the company. Thus, if any
execution, either at Law or in Equity, shall have been issued
against the effects of any company, and there is not suffi
cient whereon to levy execution, then an order of the
Court in which the action, suit, or other proceeding shall
have been brought, may be obtained to levy execution
upon the property of the shareholder; but only upon
motion in open Court, and after sufficient notice in writing
to the person sought to be charged. Upon such order
being made, execution may issue accordingly (a).
For the purpose of ascertaining who are the shareholders
in a company, a creditor, after such order obtained, is en
titled, at all reasonable times, to inspect the register of
shareholders without the payment of any fee (b). If, by
means of such execution, the shareholder shall have been

compelled to pay more than the amount of calls then due
from him, he will be entitled to be reimbursed such addi
tional sum by the directors out of the funds of the com
pany (a).
The liability of a party, whether an original subscriber
or the transferree of a registered proprietor, is determined,
as well in respect to third parties (as judgment creditors
of the company), as in respect of the company itself, by his
ceasing to be a shareholder. He may cease to be a share
holder either by a transfer of his interest to a third party,
in the mode prescribed, or by his shares being declared
forfeited in the manner provided by the Act. The Com
panies' Clauses Consolidation Act (b), which prescribes the
mode in which shares in a company shall be transferred,
evidently contemplates a determination of the liability of
the shareholder on his parting with his shares, whether the
transferree were an original subscriber, or a party who
became a shareholder by purchase from a registered pro
prietor. It is therein provided, that every shareholder
may sell or transfer all or any of his shares in the under
taking, and that the transfer shall be by deed duly
stamped, in which the consideration shall be truly stated,
and that the deed of transfer shall be delivered to the
secretary, who shall enter a memorial thereof in a book
called “The Register of Transfers,” and indorse such entry
on the deed of transfer; and that, until such transfer has
been so delivered to the secretary as aforesaid, the vendor
of the share shall continue liable to the company for calls
upon it, and the purchaser shall not be entitled to receive
any share of the profits of the undertaking, or to vote in
respect of such share.
Some of the writers on this subject have considered it
as a doubtful point whether an original subscriber who has
executed the deed can be discharged from his liability to the
payment of calls, until the full amount subscribed for has
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 37. (b) Id. ss. 14, 15.
C HAP. II.] coNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND GovERNMENT. 473
been paid up; and whether, even although another party
has been entered in the shareholders’ register as owner of
the particular shares, the original subscriber would not still
remain liable on the default of the party so registered; on
the ground, that the covenant in the subscriber's agreement
is absolute; and also, that if such a power of assignment
were permitted, the scheme might be destroyed by assign
ing to insolvent parties. Such a position, however, would
seem not to be tenable; the point was raised on a Special
Act for constructing a canal, in which clauses almost
similar to those of the Companies’ Clauses Consolidation
Act in respect of the mode of transfer were inserted. In
that case (a), it was held that the statute evidently con
templated a transfer of interest, and that no distinction
could be drawn between a transfer from an original pro
prietor and one by any other proprietor; that there was
no restriction on alienation other than that the owners
should not assign until all the money due at the time of
assigning was paid; and that it would be strange to say
that after disposing of their shares they should still con
tinue liable to payment of calls.
The liability of a shareholder also ceases on the forfeiture
of his shares, that is to say, from the time the forfeiture is
absolute. A forfeiture is absolute after the due notices
have been given and the forfeiture has been confirmed at
the general meeting of shareholders. A mere notice or
declaration that the directors intend to forfeit the shares,
is not sufficient to absolve the owner from his obligations in
respect of them (b).

(3). Transfer of Shares.
We have before shown that shares in a railway company
are transferable, and that on any transfer being complete,
the rights and liabilities of the former holder pass to his
transferree.
A transfer of the interest in shares may be effected
either by the act of the party as by sale, pledge, or mort
gage; or by the act of the company as by forfeiture; or
may take place by operation of law, as in case of bank
ruptcy, or marriage; or may occur through the act of God,
as by death. We shall treat of the law relating to each
of them.
The transfer of a share in a railway company must be
by deed (duly stamped) drawn up in the form given in
schedule B, annexed to the Companies’ Clauses Act (or to
the like effect), in which the consideration must be truly
stated (a). This document must be executed by both the
parties to the contract. After its execution, the deed
should be delivered to the secretary to be kept by him,
and until it has been so delivered, neither will the vendor
be exonerated from his liability to pay future calls, nor
will the purchaser be entitled to accruing dividends, or
other contingent advantages (b).
Although the transfer of shares must be by deed, yet it
is not necessary that the contract or agreement for the sale
or purchase of them should be in writing; as shares in a
railway company are neither an “interest in or concerning
lands” within the fourth section (c), nor “goods, wares, and
merchandise,” within the seventeenth section, of the Sta
tute of Frauds (d); although they have been held to be

goods and chattels within the operation of the bankrupt
laws, and, as such, to pass to the assignees of a party in
case of bankruptcy. Although not legally necessary, how
ever, yet convenience requires that, in practice, written
evidence of such contracts should be preserved; hence,
bought and sold notes, containing the terms of the agree
ment and the names (a) of the parties, are usually ex
changed between the brokers through whose agency the
transfer is effected.
The name of the purchaser and of the seller should be
inserted in these bought and sold notes, not merely for the
security of the broker, who may otherwise become respon
sible to the other principal contractor, but also for the secu
rity of the respective principals; as the purchaser generally
buys the shares on the implied covenant of the vendor, that
he either has, or will have, at the time appointed for deli
very (b), a good title; and the vendor sells them on the faith
that the party whose name is to be inserted in the deed of
transfer will execute the same, and discharge him from
further liability in respect of them.
The party contracting to sell need not, at the time of
contract entered into, be possessed of the shares, or regis
tered as a shareholder, nor even have any reasonable prospect
at the time of obtaining them, provided he puts himself
into a condition to complete the contract by making him
self a shareholder previous to the day appointed for its
completion (c). Nor will it invalidate any agreement for
the sale of railway shares, that some future time has been
appointed for their delivery, as contracts relating to them
are not within the operation of the Stock Jobbing Acts (d).
The remedy for a breach of contract for the sale or pur
chase of shares, may be either at Common Law or in Equity.
In a Court of Common Law, the action would be brought in

a form claiming damages for the non-delivery or non
acceptance of the shares at the time appointed; whilst, in
Equity, the plaintiff would ask the Court to decree specific
performance of the contract (a). It is seldom, however,
that a party has recourse to a Court of Equity to decree a
specific performance; the option of buying in or selling
out against a defaulter being an easier mode of remedying
the consequences of the breach of contract. Nevertheless,
it may happen, in cases where many calls are yet to be
made, and the shares with the calls already paid up are of
no value, that it will be difficult to find a purchaser; so
that the vendor, in order to avoid future liability upon the
shares, may find it his only effectual remedy to pray a
Court of Equity for specific performance of the contract.
Should the vendor fail to deliver the shares according to
contract, either at the time appointed, or, in case no time
has been appointed, within a reasonable time (and evidence
will be received as to what is a reasonable time, according
to the usage of the place of contract); it is usual for the
purchaser to buy in the shares against his vendor, and
charge him with the difference between the price actually
paid and that agreed upon. Seven days was, in one case,
held not to be an unreasonable time (b). But previous to
the purchaser being entitled to maintain an action against
the vendor for the non-performance of the agreement, or
to buy in against him, it is incumbent on him to observe
the same rules as are laid down in case ofthe purchase ofreal
property. Thus, he must not only be ready and willing to
pay the amount agreed on, and accept the shares, but he
must prepare a conveyance in the proper form, and tender
the same to the vendor for execution, and, if required by
the latter, must execute the deed as transferree, and take
it to the office of the railway company, for the purpose of
being duly entered in the Register of Transfers. A mere

request on the part of the purchaser to the vendor to
transfer the shares, after a reasonable time had elapsed, is
insufficient to give the purchaser such a right. (a)
It is important for share brokers, in order to protect
themselves from liability, before buying in against a vendor
who has failed to deliver the shares contracted for, to re
member the necessity of actually tendering a proper form
of conveyance, either to the contracting party, or (in case
of an undisclosed principal) to the broker employed; and
of requesting him to name his principal; as, although by
the custom of the several Stock Exchanges, the brokers look
to each other as individually liable to fulfil contracts made
through their agency, still, where shares have been bought
in against a vendor who has neglected to deliver them, and
payment has been made by the broker of the latter to the
broker of the purchaser, of the difference between the price
agreed on and the price actually paid for the shares; such
payment will not be binding on the vendor, unless a proper
conveyance has been tendered to him for execution, before
the shares were bought in against him. Hence, under such
circumstances, the broker of the vendor would be unable
to recover from his own principal the amount paid to the
broker of the other contracting party, notwithstanding the
regulations of the Exchange on which he carries on busi
ness. In such case,no legal right can accrue to the purchaser
to buy in against the vendor; and therefore no legal claim
could be preferred against the broker of the latter; and
hence any payment which he might make would be made
in his own wrong, and would not be recoverable from his
employer, as money paid for the use of the latter; the
custom of a Stock Exchange having no authority as against
the common law of the land (b).
The vendor is bound to put himself in such a position
that he has it in his power to transfer the shares agreed
to be sold; consequently, it would be no answer to a bill

for a specific performance, or to an action to recover
damages for the non-performance of the contract, that he
had tendered shares belonging to a third party who was
willing to convey; as the purchaser bargains for a convey
ance of shares from the vendor himself, and, consequently,
for the implied covenant of the vendor for title, and the
implied covenant of another party is not the same thing (a).
Should the vendor fail to make out his title, it is con
ceived that such default would preclude the necessity of a
tender of conveyance by the purchaser (b). But the vendor
is not bound on the request of the purchaser to execute a
conveyance to any party other than the one he contracted
with ; nor to execute a conveyance in blank. A convey
ance executed with the name of the purchaser in blank is
void, for as the statute requires the transfer of shares to
be by deed (c), a transfer would be wholly inoperative if
the mame of the vendor was left out; “and to allow it to
be afterwards filled up by an agent appointed by parol,
and then delivered in the absence of the principal as a
deed, would be a violation of the principle, that an
attorney to execute and deliver a deed for another, must
himself be appointed by deed” (d). Hence, after the
execution of such an instrument, the vendor would be still
liable to pay all future calls upon the shares, nor would
there be any implied covenant on the part of the pur
chaser to indemnify the vendor against them (e).
If the purchaser of shares refuse or neglect to complete
his contract on the appointed day, the vendor is entitled
within reasonable time after such neglect or refusal to sell
out the shares, and debit the purchaser with the difference

between the price obtained and that agreed to be given
for them; such difference being the amount of damages to
which the vendor is entitled. But the vendor to be
authorised to take such a step must be prepared to show,
not only that he was ready and willing, but also that he
had it in his power to deliver the shares and to execute a
proper conveyance, and for this purpose must produce
satisfactory evidence of his title. The usual evidences of
title are the certificates issued by the company, but such
certificates should on the face of them, or by endorse
ments or supplemental certificate identifying the parti
cular shares, show a title in the vendor; a mere tender of
certificates not bearing the name of the holder, nor being
endorsed to him by the secretary of the company, is not
sufficient (a); and the production of the register of trans
fers showing that the share certificates tendered were
registered in the name of the plaintiff would not be suffi
cient proof of the proprietorship of those shares. It would
be no more proof of the right to the shares in question,
than the memorial of a deed of conveyance in a registered
county, without production of the deed itself, would be of
a right to the estate thereby transferred. Yet, although
the tendor and production of share certificates showing
title in the vendor may be sufficient evidence of owner
ship, it is submitted that it is not the only mode of proving
ownership; but that it would be competent for a party to
prove his title in any other way, as by the production of
the deed of transfer under which he claims; if he be not
the proprietor originally registered for the shares in ques
tion. Or, perhaps, it would be sufficient for the vendor, in
order to support the averment in his declaration of a readi
mess and willingness to transfer, to prove a tender of an in
strument of transfer in the form prescribed by the Act (b).

one of the parties to a contract for the purchase and sale
of shares has failed to complete his part of the contract,
namely, to buy in or sell out against such defaulting
party. It should, however, be observed, that it is not at
all necessary to take such a course, inasmuch as an action
may be maintained against the defaulter, and damages
recovered to the amount of the difference between the
price agreed on, and the value of the shares on some day
(to be determined by the jury) within a reasonable time
after the breach of the contract.
The instrument of transfer, as it has been before re
marked, must be by deed duly stamped under the hands
and seals of the parties, with the consideration truly stated,
and in the form prescribed by the Act (a), or to the like
effect. If the consideration be not truly stated, that is to
say, if the amount of the purchase money were more than
that alleged in the deed, the document would be void, as a
fraud on the stamp laws.
So, if the name of the transferree was left in blank, in
order to give him the opportunity of transferring to several
parties without incurring the cost of a fresh stamp, or if
the name of any other than the original purchaser was
inserted, the deed would be void, unless it were re-stamped,
as the stamp would be exhausted by the operation of the
deed at Common Law, although never executed by the ori
ginal purchaser (b).
It is of importance to the vendor, that the deed should
not be executed in blank; more especially when the transfer
is of shares in companies where but a small amount of the
capital has been paid, as the vendor will still remain liable to
all future calls; nor is there any implied undertaking on the
part of the purchaser to reimburse the vendor the amount
of such calls (c). The vendor, therefore, should insist upon

the transferree's name being inserted, and should, after
showing a good title to the purchaser, require him to com
plete the purchase in a reasonable time, by preparing a
deed in the statutory form, and tendering it for execution.
It is likewise the interest of a purchaser to have his
name inserted in the deed, for the transferree of a share,
where the transfer is executed in blank, incurs considerable
risk; as in case of the bankruptcy of the vendor, should
the deed of transfer, duly executed, not have been deli
vered at the office of the company, the shares might be
held to be still in the possession of the bankrupt, as reputed
owner, and as such to pass to his assignees (a).
When the vendor has executed a deed of transfer, he
should then require the purchaser to execute it, and deliver
it, or attend with him on delivering it, to the company,
that it may be duly entered in the Register of Transfers.
Should the vendor comply with the forms prescribed
above, he will be no longer liable to any future calls; and
should the purchaser refuse to perform his part of the con
tract, he will subject himself to an action, in which he will
be liable to refund to the seller any sum that the latter
may have paid for calls, and reimburse him for any other
damage he may have sustained by the defendant’s breach
of his agreement.
It is competent for the owner of shares to mortgage or
pledge them; but as shares are goods and chattels within
the operation of the Bankrupt Law, and as the certificates
are only evidence of title, the mere deposit of the share
certificates with the mortgagee or pledgee is insufficient, in
case of bankruptcy, to vest the shares in him as against
the assignees (b), or against a subsequent purchaser, for a
valuable consideration without notice (c).

The mortgagor of shares does not part with his interest
in them, nor avoid his liability in respect thereof. The
shares subject to the mortgage are still his, and, as the
owner, he is still liable to pay all calls made upon them.
The mortgagor is, in fact, a trustee for the mortgagee; and

Notice of this transmission must be given to the com

directors, and must be authenticated by a declaration in
writing, in the form prescribed by the 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 18,
stating the manner in which, and the party to whom, the

must be produced to the secretary of the company, who
shall thereupon enter the name of the person entitled in
the register of shareholders; and until such transmission
has been authenticated in the manner above prescribed,
the party claiming through the deceased owner will not be
entitled to receive any share of the profits, or to vote in
respect of the shares. If the prescribed formalities have
been duly observed, the company cannot refuse to register
the parties entitled; for it has been held, that a mandamus
would lie against a company of proprietors of a canal navi
gation and their clerk, to compel them to make an entry of
the probate of a deceased proprietor, and to register the
name (and place of abode) of his executor, as the pro
prietor of one share in the profits of the navigation belong

Declaration.
The estate of a deceased holder of shares is liable to
payment of calls, whether made before or after the time of
his decease (a), unless the transmission of the shares by
death has been authenticated in the manner prescribed,
and the shares duly transferred to a third party by the
executors. So it is conceived, that an executor or adminis
trator may make himselfpersonally responsible for the pay
ment of future calls, should he have the shares registered in
his own name, although he retain the shares as trustee for
the benefit of the legatees under the testator’s will, or of
those entitled under the Statute of Distributions, on the
analogy to the personal liability of an executor carrying on
trade for the benefit of the children of the testator (b).
On the marriage of any female shareholder, her hus
band acquires a right to her interest in the shares of the
company, although, as in the case of other choses in action
belonging to the wife before coverture, he does not be
come absolutely entitled until they are reduced into
possession; and should he die before they are so reduced
into possession, leaving his wife him surviving, they will
pass to her, and not to his executors; should she die
before the husband, they will not survive to him except as
her administrator, and letters of administration in respect
thereof must be taken out. After they have been reduced
into possession they become his property absolutely, and
in case of bankruptcy will pass to his assignees. It has
been held, that even where the husband had not reduced
shares into possession, and where they still stood in the
wife's maiden name in the books of the company, they
passed to the husband’s assignees (c). If, however, they shall
not have been reduced into possession by the assignee
during the husband's life-time, they will survive to the wife.
The husband, to reduce his wife’s shares into pos
session, must make a declaration in the manner pre
scribed (d), authenticating a notice of the transmission of
(a) Fyler v. Fyler, 2 Rail. Ca. 873; 3 Beav. 550.

the shares by the marriage; and to it there must be ap
pended a copy of the register of the marriage, or other
celebration thereof, with a declaration of the identity of
the wife with the holder of the shares; and upon such
particulars being lodged with the secretary of the com
pany, he will enter the husband's name in the register of
shareholders, and the latter will them become the absolute
proprietor of the shares, and be entitled to all the dividends
and profits.
Another mode in which the interest in shares in a rail
way company may become transmitted, is by the bank
ruptcy or insolvency of the owner, in either of which
events the shares standing in his name in the books of
the company, pass by act and operation of law into the
hands of the assignees for the benefit of the creditors, in
the same manner as other personal property to which he
was entitled at the time of such bankruptcy or insol
vency (a). The assignees under such circumstances,
however, in order to complete their title to the shares,
must make a declaration of the particulars of the trans
mission of interest to them as required by the Companies’
Clauses Act (b). So they will take the shares subject to
any incumbrances affecting them, such as mortgage or
lien, provided that due notice of those incumbrances shall
have been given to the company previous to the Act of
Bankruptcy.
It is optional in all cases with asignees whether they
will avail themselves of their right to the shares, or leave
them in the name of the bankrupt. If they decline to
take the shares, the bankrupt will remain liable to the
payment of all calls afterwards made upon them.

personal representatives) are under an obligation to pay
such instalments upon the shares held by them respec
tively, as the directors may from time to time think fit to
call for. Any default in making these payments, exposes
the defaulter not only to an action by the company for
the recovery of arrears and interest, but also to the for
feiture of his shares. For by the Companies’ Clauses Act
it is provided (a), that “if any shareholder fail to pay any
call payable by him, together with the interest, if any,
that shall have accrued thereon, the directors at any time
after the expiration of two months from the day ap
pointed for payment of such call, may declare the share in
respect of which such call was payable forfeited, and that
whether the company have sued for the amount of such
call or not.” The remedy of forfeiture thus given to the
company is in addition to that of an action at law, and like
the latter, can only be available where the call, the non
payment of which is complained of, has been duly made.
Hence all the prescribed formalities must have been
observed in making it, due notice of it must have been
given, it must be made equally, and former calls must
have been paid, or means taken to enforce the payment of
them against other defaulters, before a right to forfeit the
shares can be legally exercised (b).
When a proprietor has by non-payment of a call within
the time limited rendered his shares liable to forfeiture,
the company in exercising the right must proceed as by
law directed. Hence the directors before declaring any
share forfeited, must cause notice of their intention to be
left at, or transmitted by post to, the usual or last place of
abode of the registered proprietor; or if he be abroad, or
his place of abode unknown, or the interest in the share
has become transmitted otherwise than by transfer, and
no declaration of such transmission has been registered,

and the parties entitled cannot be found, then public
motice must be given in the “London” or “Dublin Ga
zette,” according as the company's principal place of busi
mess shall be in England or Ireland, and also in the news
paper prescribed by the Special Act, or, if none be pre
scribed, or the prescribed newspaper have ceased to be
published, then in a newspaper circulating in the district
in which the company’s principal place of business shall
be situated. These notices are to be given twenty-one
days, at least, before the directors can make the declara
tion of forfeiture (a).
Having given these notices, the directors may, if the call
remain unpaid, proceed after the expiration of the twenty
one days to declare the shares forfeited. This, however,
is only an inchoate act, and will not take effect so as to
authorise the sale, or other disposition of any share, until
it has been confirmed at some general meeting of the
company, to be held after the expiration of two months, at
least, from the day on which the above-mentioned notice
of intention was given. At such meeting the company
may confirm the declaration, and either at the same, or
any subsequent general meeting, may order the shares so
forfeited to be sold, or otherwise disposed of (b).
Any notice of declaration of forfeiture being inoperative
until thus ratified by the company, it will not absolve the
proprietor from the obligation to pay calls, nor be any
answer to an action brought against him by the company
for their recovery (c.) Having been duly confirmed, however,
and the confirmation accompanied by an order as to the
disposal of the shares, the directors may proceed to sell
them either by public auction or private contract, and
either separately or together, as they may think fit; and
any shareholder may become the purchaser (d). Being sold,

the title to a share purchased under such circumstances
will be complete on a declaration being made before a
Justice, or Master, or Master Extraordinary in Chan
cery, that the call was made, and notice thereof given;
that default in payment was made; and that the forfeiture of
the share was declared and confirmed as above-mentioned;
and upon a receipt being given to the purchaser by the
treasurer of the company for the price of the share; and
on production of this declaration and receipt the purchaser
will be entitled to a certificate of proprietorship, and will
hold the share discharged from all calls due prior to the
purchase. Nor will any irregularity in the proceedings in
reference to the sale, at all affect the validity of his title to
the share of which he has so become possessed (a).
The power to sell shares after a declaration of forfeiture
would not seem, however, to be co-extensive with the power
to forfeit, for the latter extends to every share in respect of
which default has been made in the payment of a call;
but the company may sell only so many of the shares
belonging to the defaulter as will be sufficient, as nearly
as they can ascertain at the time of the sale, to pay the
arrears of calls and interest, and the expenses attending
the forfeiture and sale. If there remain any surplus the
defaulter will be entitled to it on demand (b).
Nor can the power to sell be exercised at all, if at any time
before the sale actually takes place, the proprietor of the
shares shall pay all arrears, interest, and expenses; but the .
shares shall then revert to him in such manner as if the
calls had been duly paid (c).
It would seem, also, that where a portion only of the
forfeited shares are sold, and the proceeds are applied in
payment of the calls, interest, and expenses, in respect of
the remainder, that the latter would, under the last-cited
clause, revert to the owner, as if no forfeiture had ever
taken place.

against by a Court of Equity, although the making of the
call were accidentally unknown to the proprietor, and he
was absent from town when the notice of forfeiture was
sent. A holder of shares must take due pains to inform
himself of the orders and rules of the company, and any
want of precaution in this respect will make the party
guilty of it liable to the consequences (b).
But, although a Court of Equity will not interfere to
relieve from forfeiture, where the proceedings have been
regular and valid, yet they will scrutinize them rigidly,
and will set them aside if it shall appear that they were
not strictly in accordance with the powers given to the com
pany. Thus, where a company had authority, in certain
cases, to cancel, extinguish, and declare forfeited, or to sell
and dispose of the shares of any proprietor; and, after due
notice the directors, by a resolution, declared the shares
to be forfeited and cancelled; and it appearing to them
that the value of the shares on that day was £10,000 it
was resolved that credit should be given to the proprietor
for that amount; and a bill was afterwards filed to set aside
the cancellation; and from the evidence it appeared,that the
market price of the shares on the day of cancellation slightly
exceeded the price allowed by the directors; but it was
proved that if the number of shares cancelled (a thou
sand) had been carried into the market, the price would
have been reduced greatly below the amount allowed by
the directors: it was, nevertheless, held, that the directors,
having placed themselves by the cancellation in the situation
both of vendors and purchasers, were bound to allow the
highest market price which could be obtained for the
shares, without speculating on what might be the effect of
throwing them into the market, and the cancellation was
therefore declared void and was set aside (b).

(5) Creation of New Shares.
The Act of Incorporation of a railway company usually
gives power to borrow money to a certain amount, and
under certain restrictions; and the Companies’ Clauses
Act(a) authorises the raising of that amount, or any part
thereof, by the creation of new shares, either in order to
obviate the necessity of borrowing, or to pay off a loan.
This authority can only be exercised at a general meeting.
The money so to be raised is to be considered part of the
general capital, and is subject to all the same provisions in
relation to calls, forfeiture, and the like, as the original
capital; except as to the periods of making the calls, and
their amount, which the company may fix from time to
time as they may think fit (b).
The new shares so created are, in case the original
shares shall then be at a premium, to be offered to the
then shareholders in proportion to the existing shares held
by them respectively; for which purpose the new capital
is to be divided into shares of such an amount as will
admit of its being conveniently apportioned among the
proprietors of the original shares. The offer must be
made to them by letter under the hand of the secretary,
left at, or sent by post to, the last place of abode of
each shareholder, as shown by the shareholder’s address
book (c).
These new shares will vest in and belong to the share
holders who shall accept the same, and pay the value
thereof at the time, and by the instalments to be fixed
by the company; and in default of acceptance by any
shareholder within a month after the offer made, and
payment of the instalments called for, the right of the
shareholder ceases, and the company may dispose of

the shares as they deem most advisable (a). The period
thus limited, within which a proprietor must elect to
accept the new shares, or forfeit his claim altogether,
will not be extended in favour of persons who may
be out of the country, and at such a distance that it
would be impossible to transmit the company’s offer and
receive an answer before the expiration of the appointed
time; nor will there, in such case, be any equitable ground
for relief (b).
The power to determine at what time the new capital
shall be raised, and the instalments thereof paid, being
entrusted to the company in general meeting assembled;
it is usual in the resolution for augmenting the capital to
ascertain the parties to be entitled to claim a share of it,
by specifying those who on a day therein named shall be
on the register of the shareholders of the company; and
such parties, and those only, will be entitled accordingly.
If, at the period the augmentation of capital takes place,
the existing shares are not at a premium, the new shares
may be of such amount, and issued in such manner, and
on such terms, as the company shall think fit (c).
(6) Consolidation of Shares into Stock.
The only remaining subject necessary to be mentioned
under the head of shares, is the power given by the Com
panies’ Clauses Act to convert the shares in a railway com
pany, or any proportion of them, into a general capital
stock. This power applies only to those shares, however,
upon which the whole of the instalments have been paid
up; nor can it be exercised except with the consent of
three-fifths of the votes of the shareholders present, in

person or by proxy, at a general meeting of the company,
and after due notice given for that purpose (a).
On such consolidation taking place, all the provisions of
the General and Special Railway Acts, which require or
imply that the capital of the company shall be divided into
shares of a given amount, and distinguished by numbers,
will, as to the consolidated capital, cease and be of no
effect; and the holders of the consolidated stock may
thenceforth transfer their interests therein according to the
regulations made for the transfer of shares; a register of
the transfers being kept, and each entry made at a charge
not exceeding two shillings and sixpence (b).
A register of the names of the holders of stock is to be
kept, and it is to be open at all reasonable times for the
inspection of the several holders of shares and stock in the
undertaking (c).
All the rights of participation in the dividends and
profits of the company belonging to the holders of shares,
will attach to the proprietors of stock, according to their
respective interests; and such interests will, in proportion
to their amount, confer the same privileges and advantages
for the purpose of voting at meetings, qualification for the
office of directors, and other purposes, as would have been
conferred by shares of equal amount in the capital of the
company. But none of these privileges, except the parti
cipation in dividends and profits, will be conferred by any
aliquot part of such amount of consolidated stock as would
not, if existing in shares, have conferred such privileges (d).
SEC. II.—Calls.

by the shareholders immediately after incorporation, but
is usually paid by instalments of such an amount and
at such intervals as are therein prescribed. Subject to
such provisions, a discretion is entrusted to the board of
directors to call in the capital as the exigencies of the com
pany may require; but the several calls must be made
with a due observance of all the preliminaries and con
ditions set forth in the General and Special Railway Acts.
In treating of this subject, we shall include a notice of all
particulars regarding the making of calls, the parties liable
to pay them, and the consequences of default.
The Companies’ Clauses Act provides (a), that it shall be
lawful for the company, from time to time, to make such
calls of money upon the respective shareholders, in respect
of the amount of capital respectively subscribed, or owing
by them, as they shall think fit. This power is delegated
to the directors, who have the same discretion in the exer
cise of it as belongs to them in relation to other matters
entrusted to their superintendence. The Special Act usually
contains a provision regulating the intervals between the
several calls, and no successive calls can be made at less
than such prescribed intervals. So the amount of the calls
severally, and the aggregate amount of calls in a year, must
not exceed that fixed by the Act of Incorporation. It is
no valid objection to a call, that the resolution making it
was prospective, there being nothing in the Companies'
Clauses Act expressly requiring the directors to make the
calls immediately. They may make calls from time to time
as they think fit, when the exigencies of the company re
quire it; and the nature of the debts and engagements of
the company may well be such that the amount of calls
would as certainly be wanting at a future day as on the
very day when the resolution is made (b).
Whilst, however, calls may be made prospectively, it

would be illegal, after allowing an interval of time to pass,
during which several calls might have been made, for the
directors to attempt at once to call in such an amount of
capital as they would have been authorised to call for, if
it had been properly distributed over the period which has
been suffered to elapse (a).
Not less than twenty-one days’ notice must be given of
each call. It is usual, in practice, to send a notice to each
individual shareholder; but this does not appear to be ne
cessary to ensure the validity of the call, provided such
notices shall have been advertised in the newspaper pre
scribed in the Special Act; or, if none be prescribed, or the
one prescribed have ceased to be published, then in a news
paper circulating in the district in which the principal office
of the company is situated. The notice should specify the
amount of the call in respect of each share, the day on or
before which the call is to be paid, and the places where and
the persons to whom it is payable. If these particulars be
duly set forth in the notice, it will not invalidate the call,
that the original resolution of the directors, as entered in
the minute-book of their proceedings, did not specify such
particulars; inasmuch as it has been held, that the directors
might fix the time, place, and manner of payment, after
the original resolution had been made, and by a distinct
act. Nor need it be shown that the minute-book con
taining the resolution was signed by the chairman at the
meeting at which it was passed, as the attaching of his
signature when presiding at a subsequent meeting is suffi
cient (b).
There is no express provision requiring the whole of the
capital to be subscribed before the directors are author

ized to make calls upon the shareholders, similar to that
in the Lands Clauses Act relating to the exercise of
compulsory powers by the company in the taking of
lands (a); but as it is obvious that no calls can become
necessary until the purchase of lands or the execution of
the work is commenced, practically, it will be found that
the subscription must be complete before the calls are
made.
A mere informality or defect in the appointment of a
director, or the fact of one or more of them being dis
qualified from acting, will not invalidate a call made by
the board (b). So a call will be good, though at the time
at which it was made there was not the number of direc
tors upon the Board prescribed by the Special Act (c).
So where the directors of a company, in order to comply
with the Standing Order of the House of Lords, subscribed
for a large additional number of shares in the under
taking, and signed a declaration that they held them in
trust for the company, which trust was afterwards annulled
at a general meeting; a call made upon the shareholders
generally, although not made in respect of the above
shares, was held valid; and it was decided that a regis
tered shareholder could not be relieved from his legal
liability to pay calls on his shares, on the ground that
the additional subscriptions were fictitious and fraudu
lent, for the colourable purpose of complying with the
order of the House of Lords, and that the capital of the
undertaking bond fide subscribed for, was inadequate to
carry out the project (d). In this case, however, the
directors were held liable to pay the calls upon those

shares in respect of which their trust had been annulled;
and hence we may conclude, that they could not have
enforced a subsequent call upon the shareholders, so long as
the former due from them upon the shares in question
remained unpaid.
Nor can the liability of a shareholder in an action
brought against him to recover the amount of a call, be
evaded by a plea that the company have deviated from
the plans sanctioned by Parliament; as that is a matter
which, although proper to be discussed at a meeting of
the company, yet can furnish no legal answer to the
action (a).
The register of shareholders is primá facie evidence of
the liability of a party to the payment of calls in respect
of the shares standing in his name (b). It is not, how
ever, conclusive proof thereof; for, on the one hand, a per
son who has never been registered as a shareholder may
be liable to the payment of calls; and on the other, an
individual whose name remains on the register as the
owner of certain shares may not be liable. Thus, it has
been held, on the first branch of the alternative, that a party
who subscribed the parliamentary contract, but who never
brought in his scrip certificates, or was registered as a
shareholder, was nevertheless liable for the payment of
calls upon the shares for which he had subscribed (c). So,
where the purchaser of scrip certificates sent them in,
claiming to be registered, and received a receipt for his
scrip, with a notice that they would be exchanged for
sealed certificates on demand; he was held liable to the
payment of calls upon the shares, although he had never
applied for or obtained certificates of shares, nor otherwise
complied with the provisions of the Act; as he had, by

his own representations and claim to be registered, pre
cluded himself from taking the objection that the formal
requirements of the Act had not been complied with (a).
As to the second branch of the alternative, namely, an
exemption from liability, even where the name of the party
remains upon the register; although no cases have been
decided expressly on the point, yet we may remark, that
if a shareholder has transferred his shares in the manner
prescribed by law, and has delivered the deed of transfer
to the secretary, he is thereby relieved from his liability
upon the shares; notwithstanding that, through the neg
lect of that officer, a memorial of the transfer has never
been entered in the books of the company, nor the name
of the transferree erased from the register; the vendor of
a share continuing liable upon it only until he has deli
vered to the secretary the deed of transfer, and the right
of the transferree in respect of it arising at the same mo
ment (b). In this case, the neglect of an officer of the
company is not allowed to prejudice another; and hence,
as soon as the document is duly deposited in the secretary's
hands, it is valid for all purposes as between the depositor
and the company. But the party transferring must have
complied strictly with the provisions of the General and
Special Railway Acts, in order to ensure an exemption from
liability upon the shares transferred (c). Where, however,
there are certain irregularities in the mode of transfer, but
a memorial of the transfer deed has been entered at the
request of the transferree, and he is registered as a share
holder, he will be held liable as such. Thus, where a
purchaser of shares received a transfer with a blank for the
name of the purchaser, and stating the consideration un
truly, which, however, he forwarded to the secretary, with
a claim to be registered as a proprietor, and he was re
gistered accordingly; it was held that, having made such

representations to the company as induced them to register
him, he was precluded by his representation from objecting
to the transfer; and was, therefore, liable to the payment
of the calls (a).
It may become a question as to who is liable for the
payment of calls where shares in a company have been
transferred, and the deed of transfer delivered to the secre
tary, in the interval between the day on which a call is
made, and that on which it becomes payable. From the
terms used in the Companies’ Clauses Consolidation
Act it would appear that the liability for a call attaches
upon the party who is the owner of the share at the time
when the call is made. Thus it enacts (b), that “No share
holder shall be entitled to transfer any share after any call
shall have been made in respect thereof, until he shall have
paid such call, and all other calls then due upon all the
shares held by him.” And in a subsequent section (c) it
is provided, that on the trial of an action for calls, “It shall
be sufficient to prove (inter alia) that the defendant, at the
time of making such call, was the holder of one share or
more in the undertaking.” From the language of these
two sections, it may be safely inferred, that the day on
which a call is made payable is immaterial in considering
the question as to the party liable to pay it; the time of
making it being that at which the obligation attached upon
the then holder of any share in the company. This view -
is to some effect confirmed by the following case. An
action was brought by a railway company against a de
fendant for a call, notice of which was given on the 6th of
March, payable on the 9th of April. A deed of transfer
of the shares from the original holder to the defendant was
produced, and the transfer-book of the company, contain
ing a memorial, both of which bore date the 7th of April.
It was held that the defendant, not having become a
proprietor until after the day on which the call was

made, was not liable to pay it (a). Having been defeated
in their claim against the purchaser, the company sought
to recover the call from the vendor of the shares, and
brought their action accordingly. It was held by the
Court of Common Pleas, that no right of action for a call
is given by the Act, or exists independently of it, against
a party (not appearing to be an original subscriber), who
had held a share at the time a call was made, but who had
transferred and entered a memorial of his transfer before
the call was payable; and that the duty to pay a call in
such case does not arise until the day appointed by the
directors for payment. And it was intimated that there
are only three cases in which an action for calls can be
maintained under the Act. 1. Against a subscriber. 2.
Against an owner for the time being. 3. Against a party
who, having transferred his shares, is no longer a share
holder, but whose liability is continued because no memo
rial of the transfer has been entered (b). This decision, and
the principles on which it proceeded, were afterwards re
viewed in a Court of Error; and it was held that the de
claration disclosed a good cause of action against the de
fendant, and that the plea of a transfer of the shares and
entry of the memorial thereof by the company, previous to
the day on which the call was payable, was bad as an
argumentative denial that the defendant was ever indebted
to the company (c).
It thus appearing, both from the language of the Com
panies' Clauses Act upon the subject, and from the de
cisions which have taken place, that the liability to the
payment of a call attaches upon the owner of the share at
the time it is made, and not upon the owner at the time
it becomes payable; it only remains to inquire when a call
is considered to be made, so as to fix the liability of the
then proprietor of a share; whether it is to be dated from
the day on which the original resolution of the directors to

make the call is passed, or from the day of fixing the mode
of payment, or from that on which notice was given of
the time and place at which the call would be payable.
No judicial decision has been given upon these points, but
to follow the words of Mr. Baron Parke (in a case which
ultimately went off on another ground), on this subject:—
“It may be that the resolution of the directors is only an
inchoate act, and that the call is not complete until the
mode of payment is appointed, and notice thereof given.
So that no one is liable, unless he be a proprietor, when
the whole of these circumstances have occurred; and until
all these have occured, a proprietor is not deprived of a
right of free transfer. It may be that both the liability
to pay the instalment and the impediment to the transfer
attach from the date of the resolution itself, though the
mode of payment be not fixed nor notice given till after
wards. Or, lastly, it may happen that the term ‘ call’ may
for one purpose date from the resolution, and for another
from a different time (a).” The importance of the questions
here raised may be very much diminished by the resolution
making the call being so framed as to fix the amount,
time, and manner of payment, and by the immediate issuing
of the notice required by the Act. In the meanwhile, we
may observe, that the provisions of the Companies’ Clauses
Act in relation to the matter, to be proved in an action
for calls, would lead to the conclusion, that the call is to
be considered as made from the date of the resolution
rather than of the notice; for it is enacted (b), that on the
trial of such action it shall (inter alia) be sufficient to
prove that the call was in fact made, and such notice
thereof given, as is directed by this or the Special Act;
thus drawing a distinction between the making of the call
and the notice of it; treating them as two distinct facts,
both of which must be proved.

(b) 8 Vic, c. 16. s. 27.
CHAP. II.] constituTION, FUNCTIONS, AND GOVERNMENT. 501
Having thus ascertained the parties liable to the pay
ment of a call, it only remains to be observed, that the
liability in question having once attached upon them will
devolve to their representatives. Thus, in case of death,
the estate of the deceased shareholder will be liable (a) to
the payment of calls; and it is immaterial whether they
were made before or after his decease. So, in the event
of bankruptcy or insolvency, the company will be entitled
to prove for the calls due ; or, if the declaration of bank
ruptcy or insolvency required by law shall not have been
duly lodged with the secretary of the company, the bank
rupt or insolvent himself may again become liable in re
spect of calls accruing due after the act of bankruptcy, or
subsequent to the filing of the petition; as it seems doubt
ful whether the bankrupt’s certificate and the discharge
under the Insolvent Act would operate as a bar to the re
covery of future calls (b).
From the considerations above suggested as to the
parties responsible to a company for the payment of calls,
we may draw these general conclusions:—first, where no
party has been entered on the register of shareholders in
respect of certain shares, nor any claim to that effect been
sent in, the company must resort to the original sub
scriber; secondly, where a holder of scrip, not being an
original subscriber, has sent in the certificates with a claim
to be registered, the company may elect either to adopt
him and enter his name on the register accordingly, or
may revert to the original subscriber; thirdly, where the
name of a party is on the register at the time of the making
of the call he will be liable to pay it, provided no deed of
transfer shall have been lodged with the secretary prior to
the date of that call; fourthly, where a transfer is effected
in the interval between the day of the making of the call
and the day on which it becomes payable, the transferror
will be the party liable to the company.

If a shareholder neglect to pay a call on the day fixed, he
will be liable to pay interest for the same, at the rate allowed
by law, until actual payment thereof. This may be re
covered in an action for the call, although no count for in
terest be inserted in the declaration, as that may be added
by the jury, on the ground that where a statute gives an
action of debt, it gives that which is auxiliary to it, and
the consequence of such an action, which is damages for
the detention of the debt (a).
So long as a call remains due and unpaid upon any of
his shares, the owner thereof will be disabled from exer
cising certain privileges attached to the ownership of
shares. Thus, he cannot vote at any meeting of the com
pany until he has paid all the calls then due upon all the
shares held by him (b). So he is precluded, under like
circumstances, from transferring his interest in the shares,
or any of them. Nor can any dividends be claimed by
the owner in respect of any of the shares possessed by him,
until he has paid up the calls due upon every share stand
ing in his name (c).
We have already (impliedly) intimated, that any default
in paying calls when due will subject the defaulter to an
action at the suit of the company for their recovery; and
the Companies’ Clauses Act has provided a form of de
claration in such cases, and prescribed the nature and
amount of the evidence which shall be necessary to sup
port it (d). This action may be maintained, although the
directors shall have given notice to the owner of a declara
tion of the forfeiture of his shares for the non-payment of
the calls; inasmuch as the forfeiture is not complete until
the declaration has been confirmed at a general meeting of
the company, ordinary or extraordinary (e). The only re

maining consequence of the non-payment of calls, to which
we need allude, is the liability ofthe owner to have his shares
forfeited for such default. This remedy is given to the di
rectors by the Companies' Clauses Act (a), and is available
in any case, whether the company have sued for the amount
of the calls or not. In exercising the power of forfeiture,
due notices must be given, and the other formalities pre
scribed by law must be diligently observed; but for the
particulars we refer the reader to a former portion of this
work, where they are treated at large (b).
SEC. III.—Dividends.
THE power to declare dividends in a railway company is
entrusted to a general meeting. For all other purposes,
a certain prescribed quorum must be present in order to
constitute the meeting, but for the purpose of declaring a
dividend this is not necessary; and it would appear that,
provided due notice had been given of the meeting, an
attendance of proprietors, however limited, would be suffi
cient to enable them to transact this portion of the busi
ness of the day (c). Whilst, however, the authority to
declare a dividend is vested in the proprietors in general
meeting assembled, yet that authority is limited and con
trolled in its exercise by the Board of Directors. For pre
viously to every ordinary meeting at which a dividend is
intended to be declared, the directors must cause a scheme
to be prepared, showing the profits since the last dividend,
and apportioning them, or such portion of them as they
may consider applicable for the purposes of dividend, among
the shareholders, according to the number and amount of
their shares. Before making this apportionment, the di

rectors may, if they think fit, set aside a certain sum for
contingencies—such as enlarging, repairing, or improving
the works—and may divide the balance only among the
shareholders (a). This scheme is to be exhibited at the
meeting, and the meeting is then empowered to declare a
dividend according to such scheme (b). Hence it would
appear that not only the amount of the dividend is deter
mined by this statement of the directors, but that the de
claring of a dividend at all is made to depend upon the
preparation and exhibition of the scheme, and upon the
character of it when so drawn up and submitted to the
proprietors. There seems to be no power in the general
meeting to alter or modify the document prepared by the
Board, their authority being restricted exclusively to the
adoption of the balance sheet presented, exactly in the
form in which it is presented, and the passing of certain
resolutions in accordance therewith ; or, if the scheme be
not such as secures the sanction of the meeting, no step
can be taken in declaring a dividend based on any other
calculation than the one before them. Substantially,
therefore, the power to declare dividends is in the directors,
although nominally it is vested in the proprietors, for the
former take the initiative by the preparation of such a
statement of the accounts as shall either accelerate or
postpone the dividend; or, if any be declared, shall deter
mine its amount and apportionment. These are steps
which the board alone can take, nor does there appear to
be any mode by which the shareholders can enforce their
being taken; or, if not taken, can dispense with them in
the declaration of a dividend. They can adopt the scheme
prepared by the board, and declare a dividend in accord
ance with it; but they cannot either submit a scheme of
their own, or declare a dividend founded on any other
statement of the accounts than that made by the directors.
They resolve on a dividend suggested by such statement;
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 122. (b) Idem, s. 20.
CHAP. II.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONS, AND GoverNMENT. 505
or, if they decline to do so, they must dispense with a divi
dend altogether.
In preparing a financial statement to be submitted to a
general meeting with a view to the declaration of a divi
dend, the directors must first allow for the payment of all
claims against the company. Hence, the interest of all
borrowed capital must be paid to the mortgagees, bond
holders, and other creditors of the undertaking, out of the
income. So the interest or dividend guaranteed to any
other company must also be deducted. When all actual
claims are satisfied, the balance still remaining will not,
however, be wholly applicable to dividend. For, before
apportioning the profits among the shareholders, the di
rectors may (as we have seen), if they think fit, set aside
thereout such sum as they may think sufficient to meet con
tingencies, or for the purpose of enlarging, repairing, orim
proving the works connected with the undertaking, and
may afterwardsdividethebalanceamong theshareholders(a).
After all payments made,and contingenciesand other claims
allowed for, the balance remaining in hand is applicable for
the purposes of a dividend. And the dividend must not be
of greater amount than can be paid out of the fund so appro
priated, for the company are expressly forbidden (b) to
make any dividend whereby their capital stock will be in
any degree reduced. Nevertheless, with the consent of all
the mortgagees and bond creditors, a certain portion of
the capital may be returned, in obedience to a resolution
of an extraordinary meeting of the company convened for
that purpose. Although the payment of dividends out of
capital is thus explicitly forbidden, it is common, in prac
tice, during the progress of the works, to pay interest on
such portions of the capital as have been raised from time
to time, out of the capital stock, provided a power for that
purpose be given in the Special Act. -
When a dividend has been declared, it is usual to give a
notice to the shareholders of the time and place at which

it will be payable. But no dividend will be paid in respect
of any share, until all calls then due in respect of that and
every other share held by the person to whom such dividend
may be payable, shall have been paid (a).
It has not been decided whether, under these circum
stances, the accruing dividends may be appropriated to the
payment of the instalments in arrear, as far as they will
go; or whether they are to remain impounded in the hands
of the treasurer until those arrears are discharged. It is
not, perhaps, clear, whether a defaulting proprietor may
give directions for such an appropriation; thereby exer
cising control over a fund which cannot be paid to him,
but to which he would seem, nevertheless, to have an in
choate or imperfect right. The dividend is declared in
respect of his shares, no less than in respect of the others;
and hence it would appear to be due, although payment
of it is arrested until the calls are paid up. Or, if no such
directions may be given by the proprietor, it may be a
question whether, in Equity, the dividend is not to be looked
upon as a fund which the company are bound to appro
priate in the liquidation of arrears of calls upon the shares
in respect of which it has accrued due.
SEC. IV.—Loans.
A RAILwAY company being the creature of the statute, is
restricted in its operations by the provisions of the several
Acts of Parliament under which it exists. Hence, the
power of raising borrowed capital, no less than that of
raising the original capital, must be expressly given by the
Special Act. Accordingly, we find that the Acts of In
corporation of railway companies usually contain a clause
empowering them to borrow a defined proportion of their
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 123.
CHAP. II.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONS, AND GovERNMENT. 507
capital under certain prescribed conditions. The Com
panies’ Clauses Act regulates the mode in which such
power may be exercised. In treating of loans, therefore,
it must be remembered that the General and Special Acts
are to be taken together; the power being given under
the latter, and the manner of carrying it into execution
being prescribed by the former.
In giving the authority to raise borrowed capital, the
Special Act is framed in accordance with certain standing
orders of the Houses of Parliament, which provide that no
company may “raise by loan or mortgage a larger sum
than one-third of their capital; and that, until fifty per
cent. on the whole of the capital shall have been paid up,
it shall not be in the power of the company to raise any
money by loan or mortgage” (a). The power given under
these restrictions is not vested in the Board of Directors,
but must be exercised by the proprietors in general meet
ing assembled; and such sums of money be borrowed (not
exceeding in the whole the prescribed sum) as may from
time to time be ordered by such meeting (b). If any of
the borrowed money be paid off, it may be reborrowed,
but not without the authority of a general meeting, unless
the money so reborrowed be for the purpose of paying off
an existing mortgage or debt (c). -
Where the company is restricted from borrowing money
until a certain proportion of its capital is paid up, or the
authority of a general meeting is required for that purpose,
the certificate of a justice that the requisite amount of
capital is paid, and a copy of the order of a general meet
ing, certified by a director, or by the secretary, to be a true
copy, will be sufficient evidence of those facts respectively.
The justice will grant the above certificate on production
of the company’s books, and such other evidence of the
fact, the truth of which he is required to certify, as he shall
deem sufficient (d).

curities.
The authority to borrow not arising until the above con
ditions are complied with, it is important for those, who
propose to advance money to a company, to ascertain, for
their own security, that the prescribed proportion of the
capital is paid, and the order of a general meeting regu
larly obtained. For although, where the seal of the com
pany is attached to a bond, it will be presumed as against
them that all the requisite forms have been observed, still
it is open to them, on an action on the bond, if the plead
ings are so drawn as to admit of it, to dispute the validity of
the document so given as a security; and to prove that the
requisite formalities having been neglected, the company
are not responsible to the creditor (a). Moreover, it is
important for the lender to ascertain, by an inspection of
the register of mortgages and bonds, that the authority of
the company to borrow is not exhausted, by their having
already borrowed such a proportion of capital as amounts
to the sum which they are authorised by their Act thus
to raise.
Money can only be borrowed by a railway company
either on the security of a mortgage of the undertaking,
and of the future calls on the shareholders, or of a bond
in the form prescribed by the Companies’ Clauses Act.
The practice of borrowing money in a manner unautho
rised by the Special Act, as upon the security of loan notes,
or other instruments, purporting to be securities for the
payment of the monies borrowed, is not only illegal, but
the adoption of it renders a company liable, under a recent
statute, to forfeit to the crown for every such offence, a
sum of money equal to that for which any loan note, or
other such document, purports to be the security (b). In
deed, independently of the above statute, it would appear
to be doubtful whether a corporate body could enter into
(a) Hill v. the Salford and Manchester Waterworks Com., 5 B. & Ad. 874.

(b) 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85, s. 19.
CHAP. II.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND GoverNMENT. 509
any contract for the payment of money except under
seal (a).
Where a company propose to raise money by mortgage,
they prepare a mortgage-deed, whereby they assign over
the undertaking, and all the tolls and sums of money
arising by virtue of the Special Act, and all the estate,
right, title, and interest of the company in the same, to
the mortgagee and his personal representatives, as a secu
rity for the repayment of the money advanced and interest,
on the day named in the deed; or, if no time be fixed, then
at the expiration of twelve months after the date of the
deed, or at any time subsequently, on six months’ notice
by either party for that purpose. If the loan be made in
anticipation of the capital authorised to be raised, all future
calls on the shareholders are included in the assignment.
This instrument must be under the seal of the company,
and must be duly stamped.
A register of all mortgages and bonds is to be kept by
the company, and a memorial of each, specifying their
number and date, the sums secured, and the names of the
parties, must be inserted therein within fourteen days after
execution. This register is to be open to the inspection,
at all reasonable times, of the shareholders, and mortgage
and bond creditors of the company, without payment of
any fee (b).
The effect of a mortgage in the above form is to transfer
to the mortgagee an absolute right to the profits of the
undertaking, rateably with the other mortgage creditors of
the company; and to enable him, if so authorised by the
Special Act, to require the appointment of a receiver, for
the purpose of enforcing payment of arrears of principal
and interest due on his mortgage; but it does not pass
any interest in the company’s lands (c). Nor (although it

should comprise future calls on the shareholders) will it,
unless expressly so provided, preclude the company from
receiving and applying to the purposes of the company any
such calls (a).
Some doubt has arisen with respect to the right of a
mortgage creditor, under a deed assigning over the under
taking to him and his personal representatives until the
payment of the principal money and interest, whether under
the terms of such an instrument he could enter on the pro
perty of the company. Thus, in one case (b), where the
company were empowered to borrow and take up money upon
the credit of the undertaking,and the rates and duties made
payable by the Act, and by writing under their common seal,
to mortgage or assign over the undertaking, and the rates
and duties,to the persons advancing the money as a security
therefor; and a form of mortgage was given whereby the
company engaged to pay the interest half yearly: it was
held that the property of the company, and the rates or
duties alone, were pledged for the payment of the monies
advanced, and that the proprietors were not liable to be
sued in covenant for the arrears of interest. And the
terms of the covenant were thought to be satisfied by giving
the lenders of the money a security on the undertaking,
without allowing them to sue the corporation. And it was
intimated, that the proper remedy was by action of eject
ment to recover possession of the property of the company.
But in a subsequent case (c), the same point came again
under the consideration of the Court. The form of the
mortgage was similar to the above, and by it the company
assigned the undertaking, and all and singular the rates,
&c., unto the mortgagee. In an action of ejectment
brought by the mortgagee, it was held that the land
of the company did not pass under the word “under

taking;” and Lord Denman, C.J., said, “there was nothing
in that expression to justify the construction that the deed
contained a demise of the land, or of any portion of the
real estate of the defendants; that such a demise would
not only be exceedingly improbable, but very inconvenient
to the public, as it would perchance prevent the carrying
on the undertaking by means of which the defendants were
to be enabled to satisfy the demands of their creditors, and
to promote the convenience of the public.”
If the company give security for borrowed capital by a
bond, they thereby bind themselves and their successors to
the creditor and his personal representatives in a penal
sum for the payment of the money advanced with interest,
the bond being conditioned in the usual form. This in
strument passes no interest in the undertaking to the
creditor, nor does it give a claim upon future calls, and, in
these respects, is less eligible as a security than a mort
gage. It is, indeed, nothing more than the personal secu
rity of the company in their corporate character. It should
be observed, that neither a bond nor a mortgage give to a
creditor any remedy against the directors individually.
All the mortgagees and bond creditors of a railway com
pany stand on the same footing, there being no priority in
respect of their claims, arising from the order in which the
securities were executed; a subsequent mortgagee or bond
creditor being entitled in all cases to his rateable propor
tion of the tolls, or other property of the company, with
all other creditors having the like security, although they
had advanced their money previously. So both classes of
creditors are entitled to be paid the interest upon their
monies at the times appointed; or, if no times be appointed,
then half-yearly; and before any dividends can be payable
to the proprietors of the company. A question of some
importance may arise as to whether the dividend or inte
rest due to a company whose line is leased, or to whom a cer
tain annual sum has been guaranteed, is payable before the
interest to mortgage and bond creditors. Any doubt on

this subject may be precluded by an express provision in
the statute authorising the lease or amalgamation, securing
to such creditors a priority over the proprietors of the
leased or amalgamated line. This is of the more import
ance because the General Railway Acts, while they secure
to the creditors of a company priority over the share
holders, do not provide for the cases above mentioned.
If either the interest, or the principal and interest, due
on a mortgage remain in arrear, the mortgagee may (if
power is given to that effect in the Special Act), without
prejudice to his right to sue for such interest, require the
appointment of a receiver with the view of enforcing pay
ment thereof. For this purpose, and where interest is due
and unpaid, a demand must first be made for payment of
the money; and, after thirty days from the day on which
it was due, application may be made for the appointment
of a receiver. So, if any portion of the principal money
be owing for six months after it has become payable, and
after demand thereof in writing the same be not paid, the
mortgagee, without prejudice to his right to sue for such
principal money and all arrears of interest, may, if his debt
amount to the sum prescribed for that purpose in the
Special Act, apply for the appointment of a receiver. If
the debt dees not amount to the prescribed sum, then
such application may be made in conjunction with other
mortgagees similarly situated, whose debts, togetherwith his
own, amount to the required sum (a). Every application for
a receiver is to be made to two justices, who, after hearing
the parties, may, by order in writing, appoint some person
to receive the whole or any part of the tolls; and the tolls
must accordingly be paid to the person so appointed,
until the debts and costs are liquidated, when the power of
the receiver ceases (b). No right of this kind, in relation
to the tolls, is, however, secured to the bond creditors
of the company; but the latter are entitled, as well as the
(a) 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 53. (b) Id. s. 54.
CHAP. II.] const1TUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND GoverNMENT. 513
mortgagees, to enforce payment of interest and principal
monies due to them, by action in any of the superior
Courts; and if the effects of the company be not sufficient
to satisfy their judgment, may, if the whole amount of
capital subscribed for be not paid up, issue execution against
the individual shareholders, in the manner prescribed by
the Act (a).
It is important here to notice a distinction between a
mortgage and a bond, as regards the effect of the Statute
of Limitations upon the amount of arrears recoverable in
an action. Where the mortgage-deed (as in the form
given in the schedule to the Companies’ Clauses Act), con
tains no covenant to pay, it is simply the case of a sum of
money charged upon land, and falls under the provision of
the forty-second section of the statute 3 & 4 W. 4, c. 27;
which provides that only six years’ arrears of interest, in
respect of any sum of money charged upon or payable out
of land, can be recovered by action or suit. The principal
money is, however, recoverable at any time within twenty
years, under the provisions of the statute 3 & 4 W. 4,
c. 42, s. 3; and if any covenant or engagement to pay
principal and interest be inserted in the instrument
whereby the mortgage is created, interest may be reco
vered for the same period. In this case, the statute does
not begin to run until default is made in payment, either
of the interest or of some portion of the principal. The
above doctrines do not apply in the case of a bond, which
being a specialty on which an action of debt will lie at the
suit of the creditor, such action may be brought at any
time within twenty years next after the cause of action
arose; and interest for that period is recoverable, together
with the principal, provided that the amount of such prin
cipal money and interest do not exceed the penal sum spe
cified in the bond.

are authorised to transfer their interests, so as to clothe

have the effect of substituting the transferree in the place
of the original creditor, must be by deed duly stamped,
stating the consideration; and must, within thirty days
after the date of their execution, be produced to the secre
tary of the company, that a memorial of them may be
entered in the register (a). Until such entry has been
made, the company are not liable for payment of the
money thereby secured to the party claiming under the
transfer; nor is the property of the transferror therein so
divested as to defeat the claim of the assignees in case of
his bankruptcy; for, until such registration is complete,
the mortgage or bond debt would be deemed to be in his
order and disposition within the meaning of the seventy

or memorial operates as a notice to the debtor of the
transfer of the debt, which is necessary in all such cases to
perfect the assignment, by giving what is equivalent to
possession in other things (b).
After the registration of the assignment of a mortgage
or bond, the assignor has no power to make void, release,
or discharge the same, or any money thereby secured.

books and accounts of the company, and to take extracts
therefrom, without fee or reward (a).
Money borrowed by a railway company is payable either
at a time fixed for that purpose in the instrument by
which the amount is secured to the lender, or, if no such
time be therein appointed, then it may be repaid at any
time after the expiration of twelve calendar months from
the date of the mortgage or bond, on six months’ notice in
writing by either party for that purpose (b). Where a
period is limited for the payment of the money, the com
pany must, on the day appointed, make a tender to the
creditor of the amount of the principal and interest due to
him, as, in the event of their default, interest will continue
to accrue until the actual liquidation of the debt; as in the
case of a mortgage, where, although the money is made
payable on a certain day, yet, if the principal be not paid
by that day, the interest goes on (c).
Where no day is fixed for repayment of the money, it is
manifest, from the language of the clauses above cited,
that the loan to the company is for, at least, twelve
months certain; at the expiration of which period a
demand of repayment can be made, provided that six
months’ previous notice shall. have been given for that
purpose. These notices may be given either by the
company or the creditor, and must be served (as the case
may be) personally on the latter, or be delivered to the
secretary of the company. After the expiration of a notice
of repayment, duly served on the creditor by the company,
interest will cease to accrue, unless on demand of payment
pursuant to the notice default is made (d). There is this
distinction between the cases in which money is payable
on a fixed day, or under a notice to that effect from the
creditor, and that in which it is payable pursuant to a

ceases on the expiration of the notice, unless there has been

actual payment; or, if necessary, the notice by the creditor
to pay off is a sufficient demand for that purpose.

CHAPTER III.
CONTRACTS.
BEFoRE concluding that division of our general subject
which treats of the constitution, functions, and govern
ment of a railway company, it seems necessary to take
some notice of the contracts which may be made by and
with such a body. In doing so, we shall first advert to the
rules which govern them in relation to the mode of con
tracting, and the nature of the contracts they may make;
and then enumerate the principal classes into which such
contracts may be divided; briefly alluding to such prin
ciples of law as are applicable generally to the making and
enforcement of them, and to those doctrines and decisions
which relate more immediately to each particular form of
contract, as it comes under consideration (a).
Corporations have, like individuals, the power to con
tract; but their agreements were required, by the ancient
rule of law on the subject, to be under the corporate seal.
Upon this rule were engrafted certain exceptions, either
introduced for purposes of convenience—as where the con
tract related to “matters of frequent requirement and of
small amount” (b); or where the acts done were of daily
necessity, but of too trivial and insignificant a character
to be worth the trouble of affixing the common seal (c);
or demanded by the exigency of the case—as where the
acts to be done must be done immediately, and it would
be impossible to wait for the formality of the corporation

seal; as where cattle are to be distrained damage feasant,
which might escape before the seal could be affixed (a).
So certain parol contracts with a corporation, whether exe
cuted or executory, may be enforced by or against them.
Thus, they may sue or be sued for use or occupation of
lands, either in the form of debt or assumpsit (b). So a
corporation aggregate may bring an action of assumpsit
for the use and occupation of tolls, although they did not
grant them to the occupiers by an instrument under their
common seal (c); and a trading corporation may recover
on a parol contract for the supply of goods, for the manu
facturing and supplying of which the company was incor
porated (d).
All questions, however, regarding the power of an in
corporated railway company to contract by parol are now
settled by the express provisions of the Companies’ Clauses
Act, which enacts (e), that “the power to be granted to a
committee of directors to make contracts, as well as the
power of the directors themselves to make contracts on the
behalf of the company, may be lawfully exercised as fol
lows (that is to say); with respect to any contract which,
if made between private persons, would be by law required
to be in writing, and under seal, such committee or di
rectors may make such contract on behalf of the company,
in writing, under the common seal of the company, and
in the same manner may vary or discharge the same:
“With respect to any contract which, if made between
private persons, would be by law required to be in writing,
and signed by the parties to be charged therewith, then
such committee or the directors may make such contract

on behalf of the company, in writing, signed by such
committee, or any two of them, or any two of the directors,
and in the same manner may vary or discharge the same :
“With respect to any contract which, if made between
private persons, would by law be valid, although made by
parol only, and not reduced into writing, such committee
or the directors may make such contract on behalf of the
company by parol only, without writing, and in the same
manner may vary and discharge the same.”
The above provisions as to what formalities are essential
to a valid contract by an incorporated railway company,
are too clear to require any comment. We may proceed,
therefore, to observe, that a corporation, like a private in
dividual, has power to contract through the instrumentality
of an agent, or by means of certain persons acting on be
half of the body. Indeed, in the case of the companies
under consideration, it is expressly provided, that “the di
rectors shall have the management and superintendence of
the affairs of the company, and that they may lawfully
exercise all the powers of the company,” except in relation
to certain matters which can be transacted only at a general
meeting of the shareholders. Hence, a railway company
ordinarily contracts through its board of directors, who are
for that purpose invested with all the powers of the body;
and, except where otherwise provided, it is doubtful if the
corporation can contract in any other manner than through
the intervention of this council of management. Even a
board of directors, however, may in some cases be unne
cessarily cumbersome; and hence they have authority to
appoint a committee of their members to discharge certain
of their duties, and to whom they may delegate their powers
for that purpose. Or the acts to be done maybe so numerous
and minute as to be of necessity entrusted to some subor
dinate officer, constantly at his post, and competent effi
ciently to perform them ; as the secretary, engineer, soli
citor, or other agent of the company, through whom,

therefore, in cases of the kind mentioned, the company
may contract.
Where any contracts are entered into by the directors or
committee of directors on behalf of the company, notes,
minutes, or copies of the same, must be entered into books
kept under their superintendence; and every such entry
must be signed by the chairman of the meeting at which
the contract was concluded (a).
Although we have remarked above that a corporation,
like a private individual, has power to contract; yet that
power is not absolute and unlimited, but is controlled by
the general objects of the incorporation; so that no trading
or other company, incorporated for certain specified pur
poses, can make contracts or agreements, except with the
view of promoting the specific objects intended to be
secured under the Act. Hence, railway companies are
restricted, in respect of their power to contract, to such
classes of contracts as fall within the scope of their autho
rity; or, in other words, to such as are essential for the
purpose of securing their objects, and are directly con
nected with the main purpose of the association. It fol
lows, therefore, that the contracts of railway companies
may be comprehended under a few general divisions, which
will include all that in ordinary circumstances they are
either empowered or called upon to make. Of these, the
following are the principal:—
I. The class of agreements to which attention should be
first directed, are those which are concluded earliest in the
existence of the company; namely, those for the purchase
of land, and withdrawal of opposition in Parliament, to
which allusion has been made in a former portion of this
work (b). Strictly speaking, these contracts are not made
by the incorporated company, but by the agents of a body
of persons who are seeking incorporation. Nevertheless,
if they have been entered into by parties duly authorised

(b) See Supra, pp. 176–179.
CHAP. III.] constituTION, FUNCTions, AND GovERNMENT. 521
in that behalf, they are considered as embodied in the
Act of Incorporation, so as to bind the company, who are
precluded, therefore, from exercising their parliamentary
powers either in defiance of, or in any manner inconsistent
with, the stipulations ofanysuch contracts. For these agree
ments are legal, and may be enforced in Courts both of
Law and Equity; the withdrawal of opposition being a good
and sufficient consideration, even though the contracting
party be a peer or a member of the House of Commons (a);
and the promoters or members of the managing committee
of a railway company, provisionally registered, being com
petent to enter into these agreements, in the name and on
the behalf of the whole body of subscribers (b).
II. Immediately after the passing of the Special Act,
another class of contracts engages the attention of the Board
of Directors; namely, contracts for the purchase of lands
for the purposes of the line. So far as regards the subject
matter of these contracts, the company are controlled by
the Lands Clauses Act, taken in connection with their
Act of Incorporation. Hence they cannot enter into any
agreement for the purchase of land which they are not
authorised under those Acts to purchase and take; but are
limited strictly to the quantities therein specified, both for
the construction of the line, stations, and works, and for
suchextraordinary purposes as are therein alluded to (c).
Nor are they controlled only in relation to the subject
matter of these agreements for the purchase of land, but
also in respect of the parties thereto; for the Special and
General RailwayActs contain provisions limiting the autho
rity of certain persons with whom the company may con
tract. Thus, whilst individuals not absolutely entitled to
the property to be purchased are enabled toagree for a
sale thereof to the company, they are not empowered to

522 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v.
determine the amount of the purchase-money, but this
must be ascertained in the manner prescribed (a).
Although a railway company are precluded from pur
chasing land indefinitely, yet they are not limited to the
exact quantity absolutely required for the formation of the
line; but so much as is specified by the Special Act
may be obtained for extraordinary purposes, as for the
erection of engine-houses, workshops, warehouses, and the
like. Lands purchased under this authority may be sold,
under certain restrictions, and others purchased; and
hence the company may enter into contracts with third
parties for these purposes (b). So, when the whole line of
railway, the stations, and the works, are completed, the
company are empowered and required, within a limited
period, to contract for the absolute sale of all their super
fluous land (c). The power to purchase and hold land in
mo case extends beyond the limits above prescribed; and
hence any contracts for such purchase by a railway com
pany, exceeding those limits, are illegal and nugatory.
Nor even within such limits may a railway company
contract for lands for any other than the purposes of the
railway (d). Therefore, although they are empowered to
agree for the purchase of land necessary for the purpose of
procuring and working certain materials to be used in
the construction or repair of the railway and works (e),
such as lime, brick, or stone; yet they may not get or
manufacture any of such materials for sale, as they would
thereby be constituting themselves a trading company,
and be acting beyond the scope of their powers.
Although it is no longer necessary that contracts by a
railway company should be under the corporate seal, yet
contracts for the purchase of any interest in land must,
under the Statute Frauds (f), beinwriting, and be signed by
the members ofany committee ofthe directors that may have

been appointed, or by two of them, or by any two of the
directors; in the manner prescribed in the Companies’
Clauses Act (a).
III. Another important class of contracts entered into
by railway companies consists of those for the construction
of the line and the execution of the works, and for the
manufacture and supply of engines, carriages, trucks, and
other plant, necessary for working the same; and for the
services of all persons to be employed in and about the
business and affairs of the company. Into any such agree
ments, a company, like a private individual, may introduce
such conditions precedent, provisos, and qualifications
(not inconsistent with law), as may appear desirable or
essential for the protection of their interests; and the con
struction to be put upon the instrument will not be varied
by reason of one of the contracting parties being an incor
porated company, but the ordinary rules in relation to such
matters will prevail as in the case of a contract between
private persons. Therefore, in contracts for the execution
of railway works, stipulations as to the mode of construc
tion, the time and manner of payment, the supervision and
approval of the works, and the penalties to be inflicted on
breach of the agreement, may be inserted, as in ordinary
cases. So, where it is stipulated, as is common in such
cases, that payment is not to be made to the contractor
without the production of a certificate from the engineer
of the company approving of what has been done; such
payment cannot be enforced in the absence of the required
certificate (b), nor will it invalidate the condition that the
engineer is also a shareholder in the company (c). So it
may be provided that, in the event of the bankruptcy or
insolvency of the contractor, and a consequent inability to

complete his contract, the plant and material on the works
shall vest in and become the property of the company,
who shall then be at liberty to take such steps as to them
may seem desirable for the completion of the works.
Upon provisions of this latter kind, however, questions
may arise as to how far they may befound to militate against,
and be inconsistent with, the policy of the laws of bank
ruptcy and insolvency. Thus where, in the case of a con
tract with a railway company, the following clause was in
troduced, “That if the contractor shall become bankrupt,
or delay proceeding with the works, after seven days’ notice
to him to proceed, it shall be lawful for the company to
proceed to employ others to do the work; and that the
advances made to the contractor before default shall be
taken as full payment; and that all materials upon the
works shall become the property of the railway company;”
and the contractor, between the time of the notice being
given and its expiration, committed an act of bankruptcy,
it was held, that the plant and materials belonging to such
contractor did not vest in the company, because they had
vested in his assignees by relation before the expiration
of the notice (a). Hence it would appear, that wherever
there is a notice required previous to taking possession of
the plant and material, it is always in the power of the
contractor to defeat such stipulation by committing an
act of bankruptcy between the time of giving the notice
and its expiration. And even should the stipulation in
such case make no mention of notice to be given previous
to taking possession, it may be questionable whether or
not the neglect to proceed may not amount to an act of
bankruptcy, and thus have the effect of immediately vest
ing the property in the assignees of such defaulting party.
But there can be no question as to the validity of a sti.
pulation that, in case of the contractor failing to proceed,
the company may have the right of taking possession of,
and using for the completion of the contract, all the plant,
(a) Roach v. Great Western Railway Com., 2 Rail. Ca. 505, I Q. B. 51.
CHAP. III.] coxsTITUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND GoverNMENT.
machines, implements, and materials, belonging to the
contractor, that may be on the works; and also that they
should have a lien upon all such plant and materials as
should, for the time being, be in and upon the land, as a
security for the completion of the works. Should a con
tractor, under a contract containing the above stipulations,
become bankrupt or insolvent, the plant and materials will
vest in the assignees; subject, however, to the lien of the
company as a security for the due completion of the con
tract; in which case, the lien will be held to extend to all
the materials lying on the actual line of railway; and also
upon land (although not belonging to the company), en
closed and taken possession of by them, under the pro
visions and for the purposes of the Act; but not to mate
rials deposited on land adjoining the railway, and not
belonging to the company, although the material was de
posited for the purpose of the contract (a). For the com
pany’s lien only attaches on materials in their actual or
constructive possession, and will be lost as to any part of
them removed elsewhere (not wrongfully)(b), subsequently
to the default of the contractor.
It would be impossible, in a work of this nature, to enter
fully into the consideration of questions which may from
time to time arise on the construction of contracts made
between railway directors and third parties with regard to
work, labour, goods, materials, and other things; nor is it
needful to do so, because (as we have before remarked)
the ordinary rules of construction apply to contracts with
and by railway companies as well as to others. A few
judicial decisions, however, on the construction of certain
of such contracts, may be briefly cited. Thus, in a con
tract for the supply of locomotive engines, there was a
stipulation that each engine should be subject to the per
formance of a certain distance with a specified load; that
the trial should be made within a certain time after de
(a) Heathorn v. Newcastle-upon-Tyne and North Shields Railway. Com.,
Rail. Ca. 288. (b) Ibid.
526 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book V.
livery of the engine; and that the maker should be liable
for any breakage which might occur, if arising from de
fective material or workmanship; but that, if the company
did not avail themselves of the option of trial, or if the
trial should be made, and should prove satisfactory, the
maker should be released from all further responsibility in
respect of the engine; and it was also agreed that the fire
boxes should be made of copper of 7-16th of an inch
thick, and that the best materials and workmanship should
be used. In an action by the company against the con
tractor for breach of contract, it was held, that the inten
tion of the parties was, by the trial, to put an end to all
questions as to the quality of the work and materials; and
that, consequently, after the trial was over, and had proved
satisfactory, the company could not, in the absence of fraud,
take an objection on that score; though, nine months
afterwards, one of the fire-boxes burst, when it was dis
covered that the copper was reduced to 3-16th of an inch (a).
Again, where a party covenanted with a railway com
pany to complete the line of railway for a certain sum of
money, within a limited time, under a penalty of a certain
sum for every day’s default; and the company covenanted
to supply to the contractor the necessary rails and chairs,
it was held that they were independent covenants, and
that the supply of the rails and chairs was not a
condition precedent to the right of the company to re
cover penalties for the non-completion of the contract
within the specified time, although the delay was occa
sioned by the breach of covenant on the part of the
company (b). So on the same principle, if a company
have covenanted to pay money to the contractor by instal
ments, a breach of such covenant will not exonerate the
latter from the obligation of proceeding with and com
pleting the works, according to the stipulations of his
COntract.

& W. 548.
CHAP. III.] CoNSTITUTION, FUNCTIONs, AND GovERNMENT. 527
With regard to the form of the contracts in cases like
the above, it is only necessary to state that, since railway
companies can contract by parol where a parol contract
would be valid between private individuals, the form of the
instrument will be entirely regulated by the seventeenth
section of the Statute of Frauds, which declares, “that no
contract for the sale of any goods, wares, and merchandise,
for the price of £10 or upwards, shall be allowed to be
good, except the buyer shall accept part of the goods so
sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in
earnest to bind the bargain, or in part payment; or some
note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be
made and signed by the parties to be charged by such
contract, or their agents, thereunto lawfully authorised.”
As to what may be such a part acceptance as to be a suffi
cient compliance with the above section, it has been held
that, where a railway company contracted for goods of more
than £10 value, some of which were ready made at the
time of the contract, and the rest were to be made accord
ing to order, and the goods which were ready made were
afterwards delivered and paid for, that the acceptance of
them was such a part acceptance of the whole as was
sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Statute of
Frauds (a).
IV. We have already seen (b) that railway companies
may also contract for the borrowing of money, within the
limits prescribed by their Act of Incorporation; and sub
ject, in the exercise of the power given them for that pur
pose, to the restrictions and regulations of the Companies’
Clauses Act (c). So they may make contracts for payment of
rent, or for guarantee of certain amounts of dividends to
other railway companies, whose lines they may propose to
lease or purchase, subject, however, to the sanction of
such contracts, by the Legislature. But the company can

not make any contract for guarantee or indemnity, in
relation to any undertaking, the objects of which are
foreign to the purposes of their incorporation. Hence an
attempt, on the part of a railway company, to give se
curity to the shareholders of a steam-packet company for
a certain annual dividend, was defeated by an application
to the Court of Chancery (a). And, in general, as regards
money dealings and engagements with third parties
(whether they be other companies or private individuals),
the powers of the company are exceedingly limited, and
the exercise of them will be watched with great jealousy.
A railway company, moreover, may contract with carriers
and others for the delivering and collecting of merchandise
to and from the various stations of the railway; or for
the carriage of goods, minerals, and merchandise, not
merely on their own line, but also on any other line of
railway (for which purpose they may enter into agreements
with the owners or lessees of such railway for the passage
over their line of engines, trucks, waggons, and other car
riages) (b); provided that, in any such contracts, they do not
directlyor indirectly favourone party more than another, but
make their charges reasonable, equal, and impartial (c).
With regard to the general powers of contracting vested
in a railway company, it may be as well to state, in con
clusion, that they have, incidentally, authority to do all
acts that may be necessary for carrying out the under
taking; and may, therefore, make all such contracts, and
enter into all such agreements, in relation to works, ser
vices, and labours, and for purchase of land and material
for the construction of the line, and for the employment
of suitable servants, and the purchase of engines, plant,
and machinery, for working the same, when constructed 5
and for the keeping it in a proper state of repair, and ser
viceable and efficient for the objects for which it was
formed, as may be necessary for these several purposes.

BOOK WI.—REMEDIES.
HAvING, in the former portions of this work, pointed
out the various rights, powers, and liabilities, both of the
promoters of the undertaking and of those with whom they
become associated as members of the company, or with
whom they may contract in its behalf, as shareholders,
landowners, or other parties, it becomes necessary to con
sider how their respective rights may be enforced, and the
remedies available in case of the infringement of them.
These remedies may be divided into prohibitive or pre
ventive, mandatory or imperative, compensatory, and
corrective.
Prohibitive, or preventive remedies, are those whereby
parties are restrained from doing an act that may be at
tended with injury to the property of others, and where the
damages recoverable in an action at law would be an in
adequate compensation for the loss incurred. Of this class,
the most usual is a writ of injunction, issuing by the order
and under the seal of a Court of Equity, restraining the
parties from doing the act complained of.
Mandatory, or imperative remedies, are those whereby
the performance of a particular act is required, and the
party either has a legal right and no legal remedy, or,
having a legal right and a legal remedy for the infraction
of such right, requires the thing in specie, and not com
pensation in the form of damages. In the former case,
the particular remedy will be by mandamus, issuing out
of the Court of Queen’s Bench; in the latter, by a decree
in Equity for a specific performance.
30 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book VI.
Compensatory remedies are those by which redress is
obtained for injuries already sustained, and for which the
party aggrieved receives satisfaction in the shape of pecu
niary damages. This class includes all forms of action at
Common Law, both ex contractu and ex delicto.
Corrective remedies embrace all criminal proceedings,
whether at Common Law or under Special or General
Statutes; including indictments at quarter sessions, and
before higher tribunals; and also the various summary
methods for the enforcing of penalties and the recovery of
damages which are pointed out by the Special and General
Railway Acts.
Previously, however, to any notice of the particular form
of remedy to be adopted in each individual case, it is ne
cessary to remark, that all actions, either by or against
railway companies after their incorporation, must be
brought by or against them in their corporate capacity,
and not by or against the directors, as directors of a parti
cular company, which would be bad (a). We may also
remark, that it is immaterial that the contract, out of which
the cause of action arose, was made previously to the ob
taining the Act of Incorporation, as all such agreements
made by the promoters are considered as embodied there
in (b); or that, in actions by or against a company, the
party suing or being sued is a member thereof; the mem
bers of incorporated companies being regarded, in all cases
of contracts between them and the company, in the light
of strangers (c).

company on an agreement under seal entered into by cer

tain persons on their behalf, before incorporation, the
parties to the contract are the parties to sue and be sued
thereon (a).
We may also remark, in this place, that no provision is
made in any of the General Railway Acts as to the service
of notice of action previous to any proceeding against a
company, either in Law or Equity; and, therefore, railway
companies in that respect stand in the samesituationas other
parties, unless the Acts of Incorporation contain a clause
entitling them to such notice; which provision, however,
will itself be controlled by the 5 & 6 Vic. c. 97, framed
for the purpose of securing uniformity in the practice re
garding such notices. But even in anycase in which, under a
provision to that effect in their Special Act, a railway com
pany are entitled to such notice (limited as the above
statute prescribes), the company can only claim it where
the thing complained of is done or omitted in pursuance
of their Act, or under a fair and a bond fide intention of
acting in conformity therewith. Thus, a company would
not be entitled to notice where an action was brought
against them for misfeasance as carriers of goods (b), or as
carriers of passengers; though it be proved on the trial
that the rails were defective at the place where the accident
occurred, or that the rate at which the train was travelling
was hazardous (c). But if such an accident had happened
through some defect in the construction or state of the
line, and an action had been brought against them as
owners thereof, they would have been entitled to notice.

CHAPTER I.
REMEDIES AGAINST A RAILWAY COMPANY.-IN EQUITY.
SEC. I.—Injunction.
AN injunction is a prohibitory writ, issuing out of the
Court of Chancery, restraining a person from committing
or doing an act which appears to be against equity and
conscience. An injunction, in fact, is the means by which
a Court of Equity interferes to prevent a meditated wrong,
instead of leaving the complainant to seek his remedy at
law after the injury has been committed. An injunction,
however, may have a mandatory as well as a prohibitive
effect. Thus, it may not only compel a party to refrain
from doing a particular act, but may also enforce the re
storation of property to the state it was in previous to the
infliction of the injury complained of (a).
A Court of Equity will grant an injunction either at the
suit of a third party, as a landowner, or other person
affected by the operations of the company; or on the ap
plication of a member of the company aggrieved by the
mode adopted by the directors of conducting the business
of the company inter se, and which may not be warranted
by their Act of Incorporation; or, in cases where the
public interests are concerned (as for a nuisance done or
committed), at the suit of her Majesty’s Attorney
General.
There are three classes of cases in which the authority
of a Court of Equity will be exercised to restrain a company

by injunction. First, where the company are proceeding
in excess of the powers conferred by their Special Act.
Secondly, where, although the thing done is within the
scope of their powers yet, by their manner of doing
it, they are virtually exceeding their authority; as where
they so conduct works authorised to be executed as
that unnecessary injury is inflicted, and damage done
which might be avoided by the carrying out of their plans
in a different manner; or where they are proceeding in
execution of their Parliamentary powers, in breach of some
special agreement made either before or after their Act of
Incorporation. And thirdly, and lastly, when it is doubtful
whether they are conducting their operations in conformity
with the provisions of theirAct, or the terms ofan agreement
and the construction of the particular clause or agreement
is awaiting the decision of a Court of Common Law. We
shall consider these several classes of cases in their order,
only premising that when application is made for a writ of
injunction, it will not, in general, be granted ex parte, un
less there is some real mischief either likely to arise or
requiring to be immediately remedied (a); but that, never
theless, if circumstances justify such a course, it may be
granted ex parte, even although the defendants have
appeared in Court (b).
Wherever it is clearly shown that a railway company are
exceeding the powers conferred by their Act, a Court of
Equity cannot refuse to interfere by injunction (c).
Thus, it is submitted that the Court will interfere to re
strain a company from issuing their warrant to the sheriff to
assess the value of land which they are not under their Act
entitled to take. In one case, however, where the company,

having purchased a subsisting lease of premises, had issued
their warrant to the sheriff to assess the value of the rever
sion in fee of a certain portion of land which the reversioner
insisted they were not entitled by their Act to take, the Vice
Chancellor refused an injunction to restrain them from as
sessing the value of such lands, on the ground, that the con
templated proceedings would, if the company were not
authorised by their Act to take the lands in question, be a
nullity; and that, whilst the entryand possession ofthe com
pany as derivative lessees was lawful, no case was made out of
any sudden grievous injury done to the inheritance (a). The
propriety of this decision may be doubted, as it seems in
direct opposition to the principles laid down by Lord Eldon
in the case of Agar v. The Regent's Canal Company (b);
and of Lord Cottenham in the case of The River Dun
Navigation Company v. The North Midland Railway Com
pany (c). The fact that the company required the assess
ment of the value of the inheritance, plainly showed that,
although they were in lawful possession as derivative lessees
of lands over which the Act of Parliament gave them no
compulsory powers, yet they contemplated the acquisition
of a larger estate than they had thus lawfully acquired by
agreement.
So an injunction will be granted to restrain the company
from issuing their warrant to the sheriff for the assessment
of the value of land as to which they have given no pre
vious requisition to treat, or as to any part of the land not
specified in the notice (d). So it will be granted, pro
hihiting them from taking materials from property adjoin

embankments on another and a different portion (e); or

placed a quantity of soil near to the entrance of a person's
wharf; although the wrongful act was done by a contractor
without the company’s knowledge, such contractor being
deemed their agent (a).
So an injunction will be issued restraining the company
from taking possession of the lands authorised to be taken,
if they have neglected to have the subscription contract
fully executed before proceeding to put in force the powers
conferred by their Act (b); and in one case it was granted,
wher eit appeared that the company had not the means of
carrying into effect the whole of the projected work (c). The
Court will not, however, interfere to restrain a company
from taking land on the ground of an alleged insufficiency of
capital for the completion of the works, as that would be
tantamount to requiring the Court to enter upon an inquiry
the result of which might be to repeal an Act of Parlia
ment, by leading it to adjudge that amount of capital to
be inadequate which the legislature had declared sufficient
for the purpose (d). So, it would seem, an injunction would
issue against the company if the termini of the proposed
line were changed; so that, instead of proceeding to some
great town or city, as set forth in the Preamble of the Act,
the railway were made to terminate in some obscure vil
lage (e). But a Court of Equity will not interfere by in
junction when the terms of the Act have been exactly com
plied with as far as regards the lands of the complainant;
although some deviation has been made at a distant point
with the consent of the landowner there, and when such
deviation produces, no real injury to the party complain

So an injunction may be obtained by a landowner whose
property is entered upon by the company before the pro
visions of their Act, as to the assessment of purchase money
and compensation, have been complied with. Therefore,
where a certain quantity of land had been taken by a rail
way company under the terms of an agreement which con
tained certain stipulations as to the price to be paid for
any additional land which might be required, but said
nothing of compensation for damage by severance, and the
company proceeded to take possession of some additional
portions of land without taking steps under their Act to
have the amount of compensation assessed; and the land
owner, in consequence, applied for an injunction to restrain
them from proceeding; the injunction was only withheld
on the company undertaking to adopt all proper steps for
that purpose forthwith ; and consenting that, on default, the
injunction should be considered as issued from the day on
which the undertaking was given (a). In cases where the
company are exceeding their powers, it will be no answer
to an application for an injunction against them that the act
complained of amounts to a public nuisance; nor will the
Court, in such cases, refuse to restrain them at the instance
of a private person, on the ground that the Attorney
General should have been made a party to the suit, pro
vided the party applying sustains any special damage by
reason of the act complained of Thus, although a public
street be rendered impassable by the railway works, yet
a private individual inconvenienced thereby may obtain an
injunction against the company (b).
The cases above cited are those in which injunctions
have been granted at the suit of landowners and other
parties affected by the operations of the company. A
similar remedy, however, is available at the suit of any of
the shareholders where the internal affairs of the company

CHAP. I.] REMEDIES. 537
are not conducted in accordance with the provisions of
their Act. Nor will it make any difference that the course
of proceeding in question has been sanctioned by a large
majority of the members of the company. Thus, where,
at a special meeting of shareholders, it was resolved that
the company should advance a sum of money in aid of a
steam-boat company acting in connexion with them, an
injunction was granted at the suit of a dissentient share
holder, restraining the company from making the proposed
advance. Nor was the suggestion that the plaintiff might
be suing at the instigation of a rival company, held suffi
cient to prevent him from obtaining a special injunction on
the merits of his case (a). So where, in order to make up a
subscription contract in compliancewith thestanding orders
of the House of Lords, the directors of a company had sub
scribed for a thousand additional shares, which, on obtain
ing the Act, they never registered, nor ever paid any instal
ments thereupon; and they afterwards proceeded to forfeit
the shares of a party for non-payment of the third call, no
calls having been paid upon the thousand unregistered
shares; an injunction was granted, restraining the company
from forfeiting theshares of the plaintiff until they had taken
steps to compel payment of the first two calls on such
shares (b). It is also submitted, that a Court of Equity
would in like manner interfere in such cases (if application
be made at a proper time before the trial (c)), to restrain
the company from suing for the calls at common law (d).
So an injunction will be granted to restrain a company,
existing under a certain constitution, from doing any act
in its corporate capacity with a view to obtain a new mo
delling or total change of that constitution, or even an

extension or variation of it, as by attempting to procure a
fresh Act of Parliament, new charter, or other powers (a).
We must now allude to cases in which the company, al
though acting apparently within the scope of their powers,
are virtually exceeding them, either by conducting their
operations in such a manner as to do more injury than is
absolutely necessary, or by acting in contravention of the
terms of some special agreement made either before or
after the Act of Incorporation, although not expressly men
tioned therein.
In order to obtain an injunction, it is not necessary to
show that the company are proceeding in the execution of
works beyond the scope of the powers conferred by their
Special Act; as, if it appear that they are executing the
works so authorised in such a manner as to produce more
damage than would be the necessary consequence of the
execution of them in a different manner, they may be re
strained from proceeding. For a railway company are
bound, by the very terms of their Parliamentary au
thority, to execute the works, doing as little damage
as possible; and nothing but extreme necessity can jus
tify the company in carrying them on in such a manner
as to cause serious damage to the owner of the land.
“Where damage is done in the execution of their works,
if it be land, the railway company are bound to buy it; if
it be not land, but some interest which is affected by the
works, they are bound to compensate the party in money;
but if the damage to be done be not a necessary conse
quence of the works they are authorised to construct, a
Court of Equity, being apprised of what is in progress, will
interpose to prevent it.” (b) Therefore, where a company
were proceeding to erect an arch over a mill race for the

purpose of sustaining an embankment on which the rail
way was to be constructed, and it appeared that injury
would be done to the mill if the arches were of the pro
posed proportions, but that the injury would be avoided if
the arches were larger; an injunction was granted to re
strain the company from constructing over the mill race
an arch of less than certain specific dimensions (a). Nor
will the fact that the party seeking the aid of the Court
would be entitled to claim compensation for the injury
complained of, preclude interference by injunction (b).
So, if a railway company, although empowered by their
Act to take the particular land in question, have made a
special agreement with the owner in respect of the com
pensation to be paid for it, and proceed, in defiance thereof,
to issue their precept to the sheriff to summon a jury to
assess the value of such land; a Court of Equity will grant
an injunction, restraining them from issuing a precept for
that purpose. Thus, where the committee of subscribers,
applying for a Railway Act, entered into an agreement
with the plaintiff, a peer of Parliament, through whose
estates the line was intended to pass, to the effect, that,
in consideration of his withholding his opposition to the
bill, the incorporated company, in the event of the railway
being made to pass through his land, should, previously to
entering thereon, pay him £120,000 for the value of the
land and for compensation; and, in consideration thereof,
the plaintiff withheld his opposition to the bill, and it
passed into an Act; and the company afterwards refused
to ratify the agreement, and proceeded to take steps for
assessing the value of the land, under their compulsory
powers; an injunction was granted ex parte restraining
them from further proceedings; and this injunction was
afterwards continued, notwithstanding the tender of an
undertaking on the part of the company not to enter on
the land until the further order of the Court; and not
withstanding that the time, during which the company were

authorised to take the lands for the railway, would have
expired before the hearing of the cause (a). An injunction
will be granted under such circumstances, although a bill
has been filed, praying for the specific performance of the
agreement; and the company will be restrained from en
tering on the land until the agreement has been exactly
complied with. Nor is it necessary, in such case, that
the tenant in possession of the land should be made a
party to the suit (b). Where an undertaking, on the part of
a company, either to do or omit a particular act, has been
adopted by a Court of Equity, it will be equivalent to and
have the effect of an injunction; so that a party would be
enabled to make any violation or infringement of it the
subject of an application to the Court (c).
Wherever an injunction is prayed for against a company
on the ground of non-performance of an agreement, the
Court will not consider the question of convenience to the
public or the company as an excuse for the breach thereof,
but will treat the company as private individuals. Thus,
where a railwaycompany,on consideration that the plaintiffs
would build certain refreshment rooms at a station upon
their line, consented that all their trains should stop there
for refreshment of passengers for the period of ten minutes;
and, after the rooms were built, the company ran certain
express trains which passed the station without stopping
a sufficient time to allow the passengers to get refresh
ment, and the company excused themselves for breach of
their covenant on the ground of their own convenience and
that of the public being thereby promoted; the Court held
such an answer insufficient, and interfered by injunction
to protect the plaintiff’s right (d).

of an agreement is doubtful, or the fact of compliance with
the terms of any such act or agreement is disputed, a Court
of Equity will send the question to a Court of Law for
decision; in the meantime granting, continuing, or dis
- solving an injunction, as the case may be, in favour of the
party who will sustain the greater injury (a). Thus, where
a company, in the execution of their works, proceeded to
make a new road in the place of one they had taken pos
session of, and the plaintiff insisted that the intended road
was not a proper compliance with the terms of their Act,
the Court of Chancery sent the case for the decision of a
Court of Law as to whether the road proposed to be sub
stituted by the company was, within the meaning of the
Act, a proper substitution for the road proposed to be
taken; in the meantime granting an injunction restraining
the company from interfering with the old road until that
decision was known (b).
So, also, where the defendants were authorised under a
particular Act to execute works for the better drainage of
lands, and one of the sections contained this proviso,
“That nothing should extend to affect any works already
made, or then existing, or provided for the drainage of the
land then vested in the plaintiffs,” and several of the clauses
in the Act were inconsistent with the proviso, and the de
fendants proceeded to widen one of the drains so vested
in the plaintiffs; the Lord Chancellor sent the case down
for the opinion of a Court of Law as to the construction of
the Act of Parliament; in the meantime granting an in

tion to be put on any private instrument, a Court of Equity
will grant an injunction, the same as in cases of doubt con
cerning the construction of or compliance with an Act of
Parliament. Thus, where, in a lease to the plaintiff, there
were certain reservations as to entry by the lessors on the
demised lands for the purpose of getting minerals, with free
ingress and egress and way leave, and for the construction
of waggon ways; upon a question arising as to the right of
the lessors, under this clause, to grant to a public com
pany a license to make a railway for the purpose of con
veying passengers and general merchandise, the construc
tion of the instrument was referred to the decision of a
Court of Law; and in the meantime an injunction was
granted, staying the proposed interference with the pro
perty (a). Although, where a case on the construction of
a particular statute or agreement has been sent down to a
Court of Common Law, it is usual, in the meantime, to
restrain a company from doing the act complained of; yet
it is not by any means a matter of course that a Court of
Equity should grant an injunction under such circum
stances (b). The terms to be imposed upon the parties are
entirely within the discretion of the Court, and will be de
termined by the circumstances of each individual case.
Thus, in one case, pending the decision of a Court of Law,
as to whether certain erections made by a company were a
violation of the terms, and in excess of the powers conferred
by their Act, an injunction was granted, restraining them
from making further erections, but with liberty meanwhile
to use those already made (c). In another case, which
furnishes an excellent illustration of the principles by which
the Court willbe guided in imposing terms upon the parties
pending the decision of a Court of Law, it appeared that
the plaintiff, the owner of a ferry, had filed a bill in Equity

to restrain a railway company from carrying passengers in
a steamboat to or from certain places within the limits of
his ferry, whereby payment was evaded of the toll which
would otherwise have been paid to the plaintiff; the Court,
having some doubt as to the plaintiff’s legal right, sent
the case to a Court of Common Law for decision; and
pending that decision, a motion was made for an injunction
restraining the company from proceeding in the manner
complained of; on which it was held (a), that where the
injury is small, and the means of approximating very nearly
to the amount of probable damage are given, and where
there is no reasonable ground for apprehending an in
fringement of right by others, thc Court will not prejudice
the legal question by granting an injunction, but will put
the parties on certain terms until the decision of the legal
right: that where the Court entertains any doubt with
respect to the legal right, it will be guided by the balance
of inconvenience: that irreparable mischief, or extreme
damage, which cannot afterwards be compensated, or the
impossibility of ascertaining the proximate, amount of
damage, will afford sufficient reasons for the interference
of the Court: that where the whole of the facts are fully
disclosed on affidavits, so that the points in dispute are
sufficiently and distinctly raised, the Court will direct an
issue upon an interlocutory application: and that, where
the only remedy given by an Act is the recovery of penal
ties de die in diem, in a summary way, the Court has the
power of protecting by injunction the right of the person
in whose favour such remedy is given.
But the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery is not an
original jurisdiction; it exists not for the purpose of trying
a question of right, but for the purpose of giving effect to
a legal right after that legal right has been established (b).
Therefore, a Court of Equity will not interfere to restrain

Com., 1 Rail. Ca. 133.

an alleged nuisance until the fact that a nuisance exists
has been established by a Court of Law. But should
the act complained of be persevered in after it has been
decided in a Court of Law to be a nuisance, Equity will
interfere to prevent its continuance (a).
For the same reason, the Court will not interfere by in
junction to restrain a railway company from making charges
as carriers, which the plaintiffs allege to be illegal, until
the fact of the illegality of such charges is proved. Thus,
where an option was given to a party sending packages
containing small parcels to pay according to an average,
or to pay for the parcels separately; if the principle of an
average be legal, and the amount of it reasonable, although
the alternative requiring the party to pay for the separate
parcels may be per se illegal, that will not render the de
mand to pay according to average illegal; and the Court
will not grant an injunction until the alleged illegality be
established at law (b).
In order to obtain the aid of a Court of Equity, the act
complained of must be wrongful at the time of filing the
bill; it is not sufficient to show that it was wrongful at the
time of its perpetration. Thus, an injunction was refused
to restrain a company from taking lands for purposes war
ranted by their Act, on the ground that, previously to filing
their bill, and before the necessity of taking it for such
purposes was made known to the plaintiffs, the company
had endeavoured to take the lands for other purposes not
so warranted (c).
Nor will an injunction be granted where a party, having
originally an Equity with regard to the enforcement of a
contract, and, being aware of it, lies by and leads the
company by his conduct to believe that he has no inten
tion of enforcing such equitable right (d). Thus, where,

on an application for an injunction to restrain the company
from proceeding with their works in a particular manner,
it appeared that the plaintiffs had notice of the intended
works of the company, and had kept back for eighteen
months, and permitted the company to expend a large sum
of money thereon, the application was refused (a).
So, where a canal company applied for an injunction to
restrain a party from draining, preparatory to the opening
of a coal-pit, having permitted an expenditure for two years
without interference; the Court left the complainants to
their remedy at Common Law (b). And where a company
have taken proceedings not authorised by their Act, but
there has been a subsequent disposition on the part of the
plaintiffs to treat, such subsequent treating will be consi
dered by the Court as a waiver of objections in respect of
the matters which are the subject of the treaty (c).
Acquiescence, however, will not be presumed unless it is
quite clear that the party, being aware of his right, neg
lected to enforce it, or to take any preparatory steps for the
purpose of intimating to the company that they were pro
ceeding wrongfully, And the delay of a month before
applying to the Court was held not to be such an acquies
cence as to debar the plaintiff from his relief by injunction,
where he had protested against the interference of the
company with his property (d). Nor, where a party acqui
esced in what he considered to be a violation of his right,
merely temporary, and not likely to be permanent (e).
In order to obtain the interference of a Court of Equity
by injunction, on the ground of an alleged equity arising out
ofan agreementwith a company which is not embodied in the
terms of their Act, it must appear that such agreement was
distinct and absolute. Thus, where the trustees of a turn

pike road agreed to assent to a bill in Parliament for the
formation of a railway on condition that the railway should
pass over the road at a sufficient elevation, and the road
be not lowered or otherwise prejudiced; it was held that
such modified assent of the road trustees, the terms of
which were neither embodied in any agreement between
the trustees and the company, nor adopted by the Legis
lature, afforded no equitable ground for restraining the
company from enforcing, with regard to the road in ques
tion, all the powers conferred by the Act (a).
Nor will an injunction be granted to stop the works
where, before payment of the purchase money for the
lands required, the company entered thereon under a
verbal consent, which was alleged by the one party to be
qualified but by the other to be general, if perfect justice
can be done by compelling the company to pay for the
land. But the Court will, in such case, order the proxi
mate value to be deposited until the precise amount can
be determined (b).
Nor will an injunction be granted to restrain the com
pany from carrying on their works, unless it appear that
the injury complained of is immediate, and the direct con
sequence of the mode of proceeding adopted by them (c).
And although, as a general rule, in cases of trespass under
the colour of title, where the mischief apprehended is irre
parable, a Court of Equity will exercise its jurisdiction;
and, whether the mischief be irreparable or not, will, by
decree, if not by order upon motion, extend the jurisdiction
of preventive justice to all cases of trespass in which
damages would be an inadequate and uncertain remedy;

of doing complete justice, still it will not so interfere by
injunction, but will leave the parties to their legal remedies,
where they fail to show that any mischief, strictly irre
parable or not to be compensated by damages, will re
sult (a). -
The Court will not, upon an alleged equity, interfere
with an admitted legal right, unless there be a manifest
certainty that, at the hearing of the case, the plaintiff will
be entitled to relief. Thus, where the plaintiff, the regis
tered owner of shares in a company, offered to the com
pany to relinquish his shares, which offer was accepted, and
a deed of lease prepared by the solicitor of the company,
and executed by the plaintiff, but none of the formalities
required by the Act in case of sale or forfeiture were com
plied with, and subsequently calls were made by the com
pany, and the plaintiff was required to pay the whole of
the calls on his shares, and on his default the company
commenced an action against him for the amount of such
calls; the Court refused to interfere by injunction, except
upon the terms of the plaintiffs giving judgment in the
action, and paying the amount sued for into Court (b).
Nor, where the illegality of an instrument (if it be illegal)
appears upon the face of the instrument itself, and is a
question cognizable at law, is there any jurisdiction in a
Court of Equity to order the instrument to be delivered up
and cancelled, and to grant an injunction restraining pro
ceedings at law (c). Nor will it interfere to prevent a com
pany from soliciting a bill in Parliament to enable them to
accomplish what was otherwise beyond their powers, though
the conduct of the company in soliciting such a bill is in
violation of an undertaking entered into by them with the

548 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book VI.
General ob
servations.
Nor will a Court of Equity interfere by injunction to
restrain a company from purchasing the lands which they
are authorised to take, on the ground that the capital of the
company is insufficient to carry out the project; it not
being competent for private individuals to assert that the
estimate as sanctioned by Parliament is insufficient, or to
ask the Court of Chancery to assume a power the exercise,
of which would be neither more nor less than the repeal
ing an Act of Parliament (a); nor will they so interfere
where the railway, as far as regards the property of the
complaining landowner, is constructed in strict conformity
with the Parliamentary plans, but a variation has been
made at a distant point, and with the consent of the land
owner there, such variation producing no real injury to the
complaining party (b).
As a general rule, a Court of Equity, in granting or re
fusing an injunction, will put a liberal construction on the
powers conferred by Railway Acts, and will exercise its
own discretion, according to circumstances; and, although
there may have been an infraction of the law, it will en
deavour to do substantial justice to one party without
imposing unnecessary hardship on the other, especially in
a case where the parties have a remedy at law (c). And,
although the mode of proceeding adopted by the company
is not a literal compliance with the terms of their Act, still
an injunction that would have the effect of staying their
works will not be granted, unless it be shown that the pro
ceedings of the company are attended with inconvenience
or damage to the parties complaining(d). But the Court
will impose such terms as, in its discretion, may appear to
meet the justice of the particular case.

an allegation that such tribunal is incompetent to decide

convenience arise from the legal exercise of that jurisdic

SEC. II.–Specific Performance.
WHERE a party to an agreement has a right to its enforce
ment, he will not always be compelled for that purpose to
resort to his remedy at law, but a Court of Equity will,
except in cases in which it is impossible or improper, grant
a decree for the specific performance thereof. This is the
most efficient remedy for breaches of agreement for the
purchase of land, made before the Act is obtained, between
the promoters of a railway company (or their agents) and
a party whose property is to be affected by the contem
plated undertaking; as the company, after incorporation,
being armed with compulsory powers for taking possession
of the land in question, might avoid the performance of
their special contract altogether; or, by driving the party
to his remedy at Common Law, and in the meantime pro
ceeding with their works, do him irreparable injury.
Where a Court of Equity decrees specific performance of
an agreement, it will also, at the same time, if it think
fit, grant an injunction, restraining the entry on the lands
until the decree is complied with. The Court will decree
specific performance of contracts with railway companies,
whether they relate to the sum of money to be paid as
compensation for land, and as the consideration for the
withdrawal of opposition, or whether they are designed

to limit the exercise of the legislative powers of the com
pany in regard to the lands to be taken, or the particular
mode of constructing the works.
Thus, where a company, having contracted to pay a cer
tain sum for land, entered upon such land previous to pay
ment of the amount, the Court of Chancery decreed a spe
cific performance of the contract, and in the meantime re
strained the company from intermeddling with the property
in question. Nor is it necessary, in such a case, that the
tenant in possession should be made a party to the suit(a).
A Court of Equity will not refuse to decree the specific
performance of an agreement for the purchase of lands
made by an agent of the company, on the ground that it
did not appear that the agent was appointed under the
corporate seal of the company, and therefore that there was
no mutuality, where the company had, before the bill was
filed, not only acted on the contract by entering into pos
session of the land, but actually made a railway over it (b).
It seems doubtful whether the fact of the contract being
made by an agent of the corporation, not appointed under
seal, would in any case (whether the company had entered
or not) be a ground for refusing a decree for specific per
formance (c).
So, specific performance of an agreement may be decreed,
although the agreement was not originally made between
the plaintiff and the parties against whom it is sought to
be enforced; as, where a railway company had entered
into an agreement with a landowner to pay a certain price
for the lands, and for withdrawing opposition, and a rival
company, who also proposed to pass through his land, had
petitioned Parliament for a bill, and the merits of the
two schemes, under the sanction of a committee of the

House of Commons, were referred to arbitration, and it
was agreed that the successful company should adopt the
engagements of the rejected one, and to this arrange
ment the landowner assented; it was held, that the plain
tiff, having offered no opposition to the passing of the bill,
the second company, as the condition of entering upon
the plaintiff’s land, were bound by the terms of the agree
ment made with the first company; and so specific per
formance thereof was decreed (a).
So, where the promoters of a company, previous to ob
taining their Act of Incorporation, entered into an agree
ment with the trustees of a turnpike road, that, in conside
ration of their withdrawing their opposition in Parliament,
they would, where the line crossed any of the roads of
their trust, construct it in a particular manner; and the
parties withdrew their opposition,and the Act was obtained;
but no special clauses were embodied, adopting the agree
ment: it was held by the Vice Chancellor, and also by the
Lord Chancellor affirming the decision, that the incor
porated company could not, as against the trustees, exer
cise a power conferred by the Act in violation of the terms
of their special agreement (b). Although a Court of Equity
will not, in general, decree the specific performance of an
agreement to build, but will leave the party to his remedy
by action at law (c), still it will interfere for the purpose
of directing the specific performance of a contract by
parties to do defined work on their own property, in the
performance of which the plaintiff, with whom they have
covenanted, has an interest so material that the non-per
formance cannot be adequately compensated by damages
at law. Thus, where, in consideration of the plaintiff with
drawing his opposition to a bill before Parliament, the
directors of a company covenanted that they would con
struct, and for ever thereafter maintain, one neat archway,

sufficient to permit a loaded carriage of hay to pass under
the railway, at such place in his grounds as the plaintiff,
his heirs and assigns, should think most convenient; and
should form and complete the approaches to such archway;
and the bill passed; but the railway company neglected
to comply with their covenants; the Court decreed their
specific performance (a). -
It has been decided by Courts of Equity, that the no
tice served by a railway company upon a landowner, under
the provisions of the Special or General Railway Acts, as
to the purchase of certain property, constitutes an agree
ment between the company and such party in respect of
the land comprised in the notice, and establishes to that
extent the relative situation of vendor and purchaser, and
that specific performance thereof will be decreed, although
the price or value of the property, the subject of the agree
ment, is not determined by such notice, but remains to be
ascertained either by valuation, arbitration, or assessment
by a jury (b).
From the above cases we may infer, that wherever any
agreement is made either before or after the Act of In
corporation, between the owners of land and others affected
by the construction of a railway, and the directors or
their agents, a Court of Equity will decree the specific per
formance thereof; and that all such agreements, made by
the promoters previously to incorporation, will be con
sidered as binding on the company, and as embodied in
the Special Act. It may be observed, however, that parties
seeking the specific performance of an agreement between
themselves and the company, the consideration for which
was the withdrawal of opposition, must show that they have
performed their part of the agreement by refraining from
or discontinuing their opposition; therefore, if a party

appear as a dissentient landowner, and continue his oppo
sition until the passing of the bill (a); or if, having once
dissented, he does not formally withdraw that dissent, nor
do any other act whereby he precludes himself from op
posing the bill, he will not be entitled to the specific per
formance of any agreement by the company, they having
received no consideration (b). So, in order to obtain a
decree for a specific performance, it must appear that the
terms of the contract were embodied in a special agreement;
a mere modified assent to withdraw opposition, on condi
tion that the railway should be constructed in a particular
manner at certain places, which was neither made the
subject of special agreement, nor adopted by the Legisla
ture, will afford no equitable ground for restraining the
company from exercising the powers of their Act, or for
decreeing an observance of the terms of the agreement (c).
So the person attempting to enforce against the company
specific performance of an agreement, must not lie by, and
by his conduct induce the company to believe that he has
no intention of claiming such performance (d).
It is also doubtful whether a Court of Equity will grant
a decree for a specific performance of a contract by a rail
way company to purchase land, if the company should
afterwards so exercise their powers as to disable themselves
from taking it; and whether, in any such case, the party

writ.
CHAPTER II.
REMEDIES AGAINST A RAILWAY COMPANY AT COMMON LAW.
SEC. I.—Mandamus.
THE writ of mandamus is a high prerogative writ, issuing
in the Queen’s name out of the Court of Queen’s Bench,
and directed to any persons, corporations, or inferior courts
ofjudicature, within theQueen's dominions, requiring them
to do some particular thing therein specified which apper
tains to their office and duty (a).
It is not, however, a writ grantable of right, but by
prerogative. It was introduced for the purpose of pre
venting a failure of justice, and therefore will be granted
in all cases where the law has prescribed no specific
remedy (b); consequently, if the party making the appli
cation has a legal right, and no specific legal remedy, a
writ of mandamus will be issued to enforce that right;
nor will it be an objection to the granting the writ that
the party has his remedy in Equity (c); or that an indict
ment will lie for the omission to do the particular act the
performance of which is sought to be enforced; for an in
dictment does not compel the doing of the act, and there
fore is not equally efficient with a mandamus (d). Hence,
this is a remedy frequently adopted to compel railway
companies to do that which by their Act they are required
to perform, where the statute, although giving a legal right
to the party interested in the performance of the particular
act enjoined, provides no remedy for the enforcement of
such right. These companies being protected from the
ordinary process of law for anything done in pursuance of
the powers conferred in their Acts of Incorporation, except

CHAP. II. REMEDIES. 555
where they are guilty of malice or negligence, the only
mode of securing compensation to parties injured by the
exercise of such powers, where the company refuse or
neglect to adopt the steps prescribed for ascertaining the
amount thereof, is by application to the Queen’s Bench for
a writ of mandamus, commanding them to comply with the
provisions of the clauses of the Special and General Rail
way Acts in that behalf. The passing of the General
Railway Acts, however, in which many specific remedies
are provided which were theretofore unknown in the case
of incorporated companies, has limited to a much narrower
range than formerly the necessity for mandamus; and
whole classes of cases, in which previously it had been
granted to enforce the rights of the applicant, or to redress
his wrongs, are now adequately met by the more ordinary
remedy of actions at law.
A mandamus will be granted in the case of a railway
company, either on the application of a party a member
thereof, or of one interested in the company, as a mort
gagee or judgment creditor; or of a third party, as a
landowner; or, where the public rights and interests are
affected, on the application of the Attorney General.
And, first, we shall notice the cases in which it will issue
at the instance of a member of the company. There is some
difficulty in laying down any precise rules as to when the
Court of Queen’s Bench will grant a mandamus at the
instance of a party holding, or entitled to hold, shares in
a railway company. The sections of the Companies'
Clauses Acts (a) regulating the distribution of the capital,
require the company to register, in books to be provided
for that purpose, the names of the parties entitled to shares;
and hence it might be concluded, that mandamus would
be the proper remedy to enforce compliance with these
provisions. It has, however, been held that an action on
the case will lie against the secretary of a company, incor

porated by Act of Parliament, at the suit of a holder of
scrip, for refusing to register him as a shareholder in the
company (a). If such an action, therefore, may be main
tained against a company, it would seem that the remedy
by mandamus is taken away. Yet the Court granted a
mandamus at the instance of an executor, commanding a
company of proprietors of a canal navigation to make an
entry of the probate of a deceased proprietor, and to re
gister the name and place of abode of his executrix, as a
proprietor of a share in the profits of the navigation be
longing to the deceased at the time of his death (b). From
this we may safely infer, that a mandamus would be
granted to compel a railway company to register a share
holder (c); to give him, when registered, certificates of his
shares (c); from time to time renew them when lost or
destroyed (d); or to assign to him the proportion of any
issue of new shares, or of debt converted into capital, to
which he might be entitled under the Companies’ Clauses
Act (e).
So, it is submitted that a writ of mandamus would
be granted to compel the company to register a trans
fer of shares, whether the interest therein shall have
been transmitted by the act of God, as by death; by
the operation of law, as by bankruptcy, insolvency, or
the marriage of a feme shareholder (f); or by the act of
the party, as by sale or purchase (g). So, also, of the
transfer of any mortgage or bond debt of the company (h).

Railway Acts as to the internal regulations and manage

ment of the company, can in general only be enforced by
mandamus. Thus, this would be the proper course for
compelling the company to conduct their affairs and dis
charge their duties properly; and the writ would issue to
enforce the taking of the prescribed security from the ser
vants employed (a); the convening and holding of meet
ings, ordinary and extraordinary (b); the taking and re
cording of votes (c); the preparing of a scheme, showing
the expenditure and receipts of the company, and keeping
proper accounts (d); the providing of all suitable books, re
gisters, &c.; and the making of the necessary arrangements
for inspecting the same by the public officers duly autho
rised in that behalf (e), or by shareholders (f), mortgage,
bond, or judgment creditors of the company (g), or by the
public (h).
So it would seem that mandamus would be issued on
the application of a shareholder, commanding the company
to complete the numbers of the governing body in com
pliance with the provisions of their Act of Incorporation;
and to appoint all proper officers, and fill up all vacancies
as they occur, so that the business of the company may
be efficiently conducted (i).
It seems doubtful whether the making of calls could be
enforced by writ of mandamus at the instance of a judg
ment creditor, for the purpose of satisfying his judgment,
since the Companies Clauses’ Act provides (k) another
remedy, whereby he is enabled, if the effects of the com.

obtaining the order of the Court for that purpose, to issue
execution against any of the shareholders to the extent of
the unpaid balance of their shares in the capital of the
company. And in one case the writ was refused where it
appeared that calls to an adequate amount had been made,
although not paid (a).
It is, however, submitted, that a mandamus would be
granted at the instance of a shareholder who had been
compelled by such execution to pay any sum of money
beyond the amount due from him in respect of calls then
made, commanding the company to make such further
calls as might be necessary for the purpose of reimbursing
him all sums of money so paid (b); it not appearing that
the party has any other remedy, unless it should be held,
that section 142 of the 8 Vic. c. 16, applies to shareholders
thus circumstanced, and who have been compelled to pay
such judgment debts; in which case they will be entitled
to the remedy therein prescribed, and have no right to a
mandamus.
It does not appear that a mandamus will lie commanding
the company to declare a dividend, for the determination
as to the number and amount of dividends is left entirely
to the discretion of the directors; the Act enabling them
to set apart such sums as they may deem sufficient for the
purpose of meeting contingencies, or for enlarging, repair
ing, and maintaining the works, and requiring them to
divide the balance only (c). Moreover, the effect of grant
ing a mandamus in such case would be to turn the Court
of Queen’s Bench into auditors of the accounts of such
companies respectively (d). For any fraud or mismanage
ment of the directors in relation to the funds of the com
pany, the proper remedy would be by application to a
Court of Equity.

company, conducting their works within the scope and
powers of their Act, for damage which may be sustained
thereby by landowners and others, unless the damage be
occasioned by the malice or negligence of the company.
For all damage which is the necessary result of the exer
cise of the powers of the Act, a mode of ascertaining and
recovering the amount of compensation is provided by the
Act itself, and the injured party is restricted to the reme
dies therein given (a).
In ascertaining the amount of compensation in such
cases, the company are in general bound to take the ini
tiative; and any refusal or neglect on the part of a railway
company to adopt the steps prescribed for the assessing or
paying of such amount to the person entitled is a wrong,
therefore, for which, previous to the passing of the Lands’
Clauses Consolidation Act, no specific remedy was pro
vided; and hence a writ of mandamus might be procured,
compelling the company to adopt the prescribed course
for compensating an injured party for damage done.
Thus, it has been granted to compel them to issue their
warrant to the sheriff, requiring him to summon a jury to
assess compensation for damage done, although the land
belonging to the party complaining was not actually taken
or touched by the company (b). So, also, where the
damage was done partly under the Act and partly not (c).
Where, however, a party suffers any damage which is not
inflicted in the execution of the powers of the Act, the
remedy is not by mandamus, but by an action on the
case (d). The writ, however, will not be granted where
the effect of it would be to evade the provisions of an Act
of Parliament, by giving the Court a jurisdiction over
matters which the Legislature had expressly exempted from

their control, and virtually to review proceedings with
which they were not authorised to interfere. Hence, a
mandamus to enforce the issuing of a second precept for
summoning a jury to assess compensation for damages
sustained by an occupier of land by the carrying into
execution of a Railway Act, where another inquisition
had already been taken, the verdict and judgment on
which were rendered conclusive, and where the certiorari
was taken away, was refused; even though it was sworn
that evidence had been improperly rejected, and that the
amount of compensation assessed under the first inqui
sition was greatly inadequate; on the ground that, to grant
a mandamus in such case (the certiorari being taken away),
would in fact be to do indirectly what the Court could not
do directly (a).
Where a particular tribunal is appointed to ascertain
the compensation to be paid in respect of damage not
exceeding a certain amount (as where the compensation
claimed does not exceed £50, in which case the amount
must be settled by justices), a mandamus would issue to
the jurisdiction or tribunal appointed, commanding them
to hear and adjudicate the matters submitted to them (b).
Since the passing of the Lands’ Clauses Act (c), how
ever, it is extremely doubtful whether a writ of mandamus
could be obtained commanding the company to issue their
precept to the sheriff to summon a jury to assess compen
sation, another remedy being therein provided; for, in sec
tion 68, it is enacted, that a party entitled to any compen
sation (the claim for which exceeds £50), in respect of any
lands (or any interest therein), taken or injuriously affected
by the execution of the works, and for which the promoters
of the undertaking shall not have made satisfaction, on
giving notice in writing to the promoters of the undertaking,
stating his desire to have the amount of compensation set

tled either by a jury or by arbitration, and specifying his
interest in the lands and the amount of compensation which
he claims, may require the company either to pay the amount
claimed, and to enter into a written agreement for that pur
pose, within twenty-one days after the receipt of the notice,
or to have the same settled by arbitration, or by a jury, as
he may think fit; and should the company, within twenty-one
days after the receipt of such notice, neglect either to issue
their warrant to the sheriff to summon a jury, or to refer
the same to arbitration, at the option of the claimant, they
shall be liable to pay the amount of compensation which is
claimed; and the same may be recovered by action in any
of the superior Courts (a).
The above section appears to relate only to compensation
in respect of lands actually taken or injuriously affected, and
would not seem to apply to the compensation to be paid in
respect of lands which the company had given notice to pur
chase, but afterwards refuse to take. In such case, therefore,
the Court of Queen’s Bench would grant a mandamus as
heretofore, compelling the company to issue their warrant
to the sheriff for ascertaining the value of all the land
comprised in the notice (b). So, where matters in dispute
are referred, under the provisions of an Act of Parliament,
to arbitrators, and the Act requires them, before entering
upon the inquiry, to appoint an umpire, a mandamus
will lie compelling them to make such appointment (c).
Now, however, as the Commissioners of Railways are em
powered, in the event of the neglect or refusal of the arbi
trators, to appoint an umpire, a mandamus would perhaps
be refused; at all events, unless it were shown that an
unsuccessful application had been made to the commis
sioners (d).

awarded, made them liable to a mandamus. Thus, it has
been issued, commanding a company to pay the sum
assessed by a jury (a); and also to pay the amount awarded
by an arbitrator (b). It would seem, however, that a
mandamus could not now be obtained for this purpose,
as another remedy is available in such cases. Thus,
where damages are assessed by ajury, under the provisions
of a Railway Act, the amount may now be recovered in
an action of debt on the inquisition, which, on being signed
by the sheriff, is made a record of quarter sessions (c);
and upon which it has been held that an action of debt
may be brought (d). Such an action, therefore, and not
the writ of mandamus, will be the proper remedy for the
recovery of the damages assessed. So, where a Special
Railway Act enacted that the company should, in a given
event, pay to another party a sum not exceeding a specified
amount, by way of compensation for loss of tolls; and the
event afterwards happened, but the company refused to
pay; it was decided, that the money might be recovered
by action of debt on the statutory obligation (e).
The same doctrine applies where the amount of compen
sation has been determined by arbitration. Compliance with
the award may in that case be enforced by making the sub
mission to arbitration a rule of Court, and then proceed
ing by attachment for non-payment of the money, or by
action on the award to recover it. In like manner, where
the amount due has been fixed by agreement, the proper
course to be adopted is to bring an action upon that instru
ment. But a mandamus would be granted, compelling
fulfilment of such an agreement made by a company,

where the instrument, not being under seal, could not be
enforced by action (a).
It is doubtful whether, in case of compensation to be
paid to parties not absolutely entitled, and who, but for the
8 Vic. c. 18, would not have been authorised to sell, an
action of debt can be brought to recover the compensation
assessed; and a writ of mandamus, therefore, would be
granted, compelling the company to pay the amount into
the Court of Chancery. And mandamus would issue for
the same purpose where a party could not make out a
title to the satisfaction of the company (b).
This writ, however, will not be granted to enforce pay
ment of the costs of an inquisition taken under a Railway
Act, as the Lands’ Clauses Act requires that the amount of
such costs should be settled by one of the Masters of the
Court of Queen’s Bench (c); and, on that being done, gives
the party entitled to them a remedy by warrant of distress,
to be issued by a justice(d). But if an attempt to levy
them by distress has failed, the Court might perhaps inter
fere by granting a writ of mandamus (e).
Nor will the writ be allowed in order to enforce pay
ment of the costs of a former mandamus, where the latter
issued to correct the error of the judge; the general rule
being that, where the judge makes a mistake, the parties
who come to defend his ruling, which they are bound to
suppose right, do not pay costs (f).
Before dismissing the question of mandamus, so far as
it relates to the purchase of lands by a railway company,
it may be observed that, inasmuch as, in repeated in

stances (a), it has been held by the Courts that the giving
of a notice by a company to treat for certain property con
stitutes at once, between the company and the landowner,
the relation of vendor and purchaser, so far as regards the
property therein comprised; should the company, after
giving their notice, proceed to issue a precept to the sheriff
to summon a jury for assessing a smaller quantity, the
Court would grant a mandamus, compelling them to pur
chase the whole of the land included in their notice (b).
A mandamus will be granted to compel the promoters
of a railway company to complete the whole line. Thus,
where a company, who had obtained an Act of Parliament
to construct a line from London to Norwich, had only
purchased lands and commenced their works on a portion
of the line between London and Colchester, and it ap
peared doubtful whether the company intended to proceed
farther than Colchester, a mandamus was issued, calling
upon them to complete the whole line, pursuant to the
provisions of the Act (c); nor would the want of funds be
any excuse in such a case (d).
So, where the company, in the construction of their
works, are not proceeding in compliance with their Act;
as if the Act required them, in crossing a turnpike road, to
construct a bridge of not less than a certain width, or to
make accommodation works in a particular manner (e), a

mandamus will be granted, requiring them to comply with
the Act.
Nor is it an objection to the granting a mandamus in
such a case, that the party aggrieved is empowered to con
struct the works himself, and recover the amount expended
by summary proceedings before justices (a). The alter
native permitting a party to construct the works himself,
and recover expenses incurred by an order of justices, not
being such a specific legal remedy as to deprive him of his
right to a mandamus.
The promoters of a railway are not only bound to form
the whole line, and construct the works in accordance with
their Act, but they are compelled to lay down the rails
and keep the line in repair, and open for the use of the
public. Thus, where the promoters of a company pro
ceeded to take up the rails in order to close the line, a
mandamus was granted, compelling the company to lay
them down again and reinstate the railway (b).
Although a mandamus will lie, compelling the company
to permit the use of the line by the public, on the pay
ment of tolls which may be demanded under their Act, it
will not be granted to compel them to carry goods, even
though by carrying the goods of others they have made
themselves common carriers; the Special Act not compell
ing the company to become carriers; and if they do become
such, and fail in their obligations, the Court will leave the
party injured to his remedy at Common Law (c); as a man
damus will not be granted to enforce the general law of
the land, if an action will lie.
The application to the Court to grant a mandamus is
made upon affidavits, not upon vivá voce evidence; and it
is requisite that the affidavits should be strictly correct
both in form and in substance, and should accurately state
(a) Queen v. Norwich and Brandon Rail. Com. 15 L. J., N. S. 24 Q. B.;

every fact necessary to give the Court jurisdiction to en
tertain the application. Thus (as regards matters of form),
the affidavits must be properly entitled, and the names of
the proper parties must be inserted both in the jurat and
the body of the affidavits. Thus, where an affidavit was
entitled, “Reg. on the Prosecution of, &c. v. The Directors
of the Great Western Railway,” and the defendants were
also described in the same manner in the body of the affi
davit, the rule was discharged for an incorrect description
of the parties (a).
So (in respect to matters of substance), they must
show a proper demand, made at the proper time, upon
the proper parties, to do the thing required; and also
a distinct refusal by them, or such a state of facts as
amounts to a refusal, or from which the Court will be
justified in inferring such a refusal.
As to the nature and requisites of the demand to be
made, we may observe that it must be distinct, specific,
and exact.
Thus, where a rule for a mandamus is applied for, it is
necessary to show by the affidavits that a distinct demand
has been made upon those who are required to do the act,
and that what they are required to do has been distinctly
pointed out to them (b). So the demand must be to do
the specific act enjoined; as where a bridge is to be con
structed in a particular manner, it must prescribe, by
dimensions or otherwise, the required form, and not re
quest in general terms that it should be made in confor
mity with the provisions of the Act (c).
So the demand must not be to do more than is enjoined
by the Act (d). Moreover, the demand must be so made

as to show the right of the party making it to have it
complied with. Thus, where a party applied for a man
damus to inspect the books of a company, it was intimated
that he ought to show that, when he demanded the in
spection, he stated the object for which he wanted it (a).
It is, however, no objection to the granting a mandamus,
that the demand is made in the alternative to do one of
three things, if the duty enjoined by the statute require
one of them, and there has been a general refusal to com
ply with such requisition (b). Nor does it appear neces
sary that the compliance on the part of the applicant with
conditions imposed previous to his right of having the
specific thing done, is a condition precedent to his right to
a mandamus; unless it appear that there has been a de
mand on the part of the company, and a refusal by the
party; as where, previous to issuing their warrant, the
company could compel a party to enter into a bond to
prosecute his claim, and it did not appear that they had
either requested him to enter into a bond or that he had
refused (c).
The demand must not only be correct and explicit in
form, but must be made within reasonable time. Thus,
the Court will not grant a mandamus to compel the com
pany to issue their warrant to the sheriff to summon a
jury to assess the damages where the party had lain by for
a considerable time(d); nor to enrol a conveyance exe
cuted more than sixty years since (e). It has, however,
been held, that a lapse of three years after the right to
make the demand, is not such an unreasonable time as to
preclude a party (f) from his right to mandamus.
The demand, however, must not be made too soon.

Thus, where a railway company took a portion of a per
son’s land, and constructed part of the railway on it, and
damaged the remainder of his property which adjoined;
and then, two years afterwards, after an apparent delay on
the part of the company in giving compensation, or sum
moning a jury to assess the amount, they stated that
they were about to do more works, which would further
injure the property; the Court refused to grant a man
damus to compel the company to summon a jury to assess
compensation, it appearing that they were acting bond fide,
and that the additional works were in actual progress (a).
It must also appear that a specific complaint has been
made to the company subsequent to the completion of the
works, and a distinct demand of what the party moving
desires to enforce. Expressions of disapprobation while
the works are proceeding, though proper to be made, do
not relieve such party from the necessity of specifically
demanding a proper compliance with the statute after the
works are done, as without it he might be supposed to have
waived his objection (b).
The demand must be made by and upon, and there
must be also a distinct refusal by, the proper parties. This
rule is well illustrated in the following case. The commit
tee of a company, authorised by statute to manage its affairs,
were empowered to appoint a clerk for the better carrying
into execution the purposes of the Act; and were required
to enter in books an account oftheir disbursements,receipts,
and transactions, and the books were to be open at all rea
sonable times to the inspection of the proprietors. A pro
prietor applied to the clerk for an inspection of the books
which were under his charge; the clerk said he would
refer the demand to the committee. The proprietor at
tended the committee, and there repeated his request;

and the chairman said they would take time to consider it.
Ten days afterwards, the proprietor applied again to the
clerk, who refused the inspection. On motion for a man
damus to the company to allow inspection of the books,
the Court held that there had been no sufficient refusal by
the committee to warrant the application (a).
To a demand properly made, there must be either an
explicit refusal on the part of the company, or something
equivalent to such a refusal, or (in order to obtain a
mandamus) such a state of facts must be shown as will
justify the Court in inferring a refusal (b).
By an Act establishing a canal company, it was pro
vided, that certain landowners might call upon them by
notice, as directed in the Act, to execute certain works
communicating with the company's canal and railways;
and that, if the company should refuse for six months after
such request, the applicants might themselves perform the
works in the same manner as the company might have
done them. An application being made to the company
under this clause, they answered that they would do the
work themselves; but they delayed proceeding; and, on
remonstrance, gave as a reason that the proposed operation
would interfere with the property of other parties, who
were likely, in being so disturbed, to bring an action. The
company offered, nevertheless, to proceed if indemnified.
The applicants, in answer, stated that they considered the
excuse insufficient, and did not understand how they could
be expected to indemnify. Six months had at this time
elapsed since the original application. The works not
being done, the parties applied for a mandamus, where
upon it was held, that the writ could not issue; it not
appearing from the above facts that, after the consent
given by the company to execute the works, there had

been any express demand and refusal of performance, or
any conduct on the company’s part equivalent to such
refusal (a).
In the following case, however, the conduct of the parties
complained of was deemed by the Court to be equivalent
to a refusal, and to justify a mandamus.
By an Inland Navigation Act, 35 G. 3, c. 106, it was
provided, that any person aggrieved by the works might
complaim to the commissioners of the navigation at one of
their meetings; and that they should hear such complaints,
and report upon them to a subsequent meeting, which
should make such order and give such satisfaction as should
be thought just and reasonable; with an appeal to quarter
sessions by any party dissatisfied with anyjudgment by the
commissioners. A party aggrieved required satisfaction of
the commissioners (October 9th), and had several commu
nications with them, but received no definite answer. He
then (January 18th), demanded, in the manner prescribed
by the Act, that the commissioners should, at their next
meeting, hear and report upon his complaint; stating that
he would, on that occasion, be prepared with evidence of
the alleged injury. His agent attended the meeting
(February 8th) with the witnesses, but they were ordered
to withdraw; and no adjudication was made on his com
plaint, the previous question being moved and carried.
No explanation was given to the complainant. The com
missioners had, on his first application, laid a case before
counsel, but had not been able to obtain the opinion by
February 8th; for which reason they made no communi
cation to the complainant, fearing that, if made, it might
be treated as an adjudication. The opinion was obtained
(March 24th) too late, as the commissioners alleged, for
notice to be given to the complainant of a hearing at their
next meeting (March 30th).
After that meeting, and before the subsequent one, the
(a) Rex v. Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal Com. 3 Ad. & E. 217; 4
N. & M. 178.
CHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 571
complainant moved for a mandamus to the commissioners
to hear and report upon his complaint. It was held
under these circumstances, that the conduct of the com
missioners was a virtual refusal to hear the complaint, and
the rule for a mandamus was made absolute, with costs(a).
So, where a company was constructing a bridge, which
was not in conformity with the terms of their Act, either
as regarded the height above the water, or the width of
the water-way; whereupon a landowner gave them a notice,
requiring them to construct a bridge, leaving the proper
width of water-way, and the proper height, according to
the provisions of their Act; and the company replied, that
they would do the first, and accept process for the second.
They afterwards made the bridge the required height,
and, to preserve the same width of water-way, commenced
cutting the banks of the river, which they afterwards dis
continued. To subsequent applications to proceed with the
work they returned no answer. It was held, that the facts
above mentioned amounted to a refusal to do what was
demanded, and that the applicant was entitled to a man
damus (b).
If the objection be made that there is no distinct de
mand and refusal to be relied upon appearing on the
affidavits, it must be taken before the merits of the ques
tion are discussed in showing cause against the rule for
a mandamus (c).
In general, where a rule is discharged on the ground
that the affidavit upon which the application was made
is defective, we may lay it down, that, if the defect be
merely in the title or in the jurat, the Court will allow
the affidavit to be re-sworn, and the motion renewed (d).

But they will not allow a party, who has applied to the Court
in the first instance without being properly prepared, after
wards to make a second application for the same purpose.
Consequently, where an amendment is required to be made
in the body of the affidavit, a second application will not
be allowed, even although the merits may not have been
discussed on the first (a).
But although this is the general rule as to renewing
applications made originally on defective affidavits, the
Court has in one or two instances departed from it in
order to prevent justice from being obstructed (b).
After hearing the affidavits and the argument on an
application for a mandamus, the Court, if satisfied that
the writ should issue, will make a rule absolute accord
ingly. The point next to be considered is, therefore, the
form of the writ; and, without entering minutely into the
subject, a few of the principal rules of law and practice
connected with it may be briefly enumerated.
Considerable care is required in drawing up the writ of
mandamus, which should be accurate both as regards the
parties to whom it is directed, the suggestions or state
ments of facts upon which the interference of the Court is
asked, and the act or thing required to be done. Any error
in either the directory, the suggestive, or the mandatory
part of the writ will be fatal.
In the first place, the writ must be directed to the parties
who are bound to obey it, in their proper capacity, and un
der their proper name, style, or designation. Thus, where
issued to a railway company, it must be directed to them
in their corporate name; and if directed to “A. B., one
of the Proprietors of A. and B. Railway Company” (c), or

CHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 573
to the “Directors of the Great Western Railway Company,”
it would be bad (a).
The writ must contain all suggestions necessary to show
that the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the case. Thus,
where a writ of mandamus to compel a public company
to pay a poor's-rate omitted the averment that the com
pany had no effects upon which a distress could be levied,
the Court held that it was a fatal objection to the writ, as
the ground for an application for mandamus is that there
is no other remedy, and that the writ should state that
fact distinctly, in order to show the jurisdiction of the
Court (b). So, a writ of mandamus to compel a company
to take steps for making and completing a railway, in
which there was no averment that the company had
abandoned the design, or were not proceeding with all
convenient speed, or that a reasonable time had elapsed
without proper preparations, was held bad upon that
ground; and the Court said that they “can infer no fault;
it must be distinctly charged; and the charge, as it stands,
is quite insufficient” (c). The suggestions, also, like the
affidavits upon which the rule has been founded, should
show a sufficient demand and refusal upon and by proper
parties.
Again, the mandatory part of the writ must be definite
and precise in requiring the parties to whom it is directed
to do what is enjoined by the Act. Thus, in a mandamus
requiring a party to do work in the manner prescribed by
the Act, it should specify some particular act to be done, and
not merely mention in general terms that the work should
be made conformably to the Act (d). But where an Act
of Parliament required a company to make “such alte

rations and amendment in the sewers of a city as may or
shall be necessary in consequence of the floating the said
harbour,” and the mandatory part of the writ commanded
the directors “to make such alterations and amendments
in the sewers as were necessary in consequence of float
ing the harbour;” it was held that it was in the proper
form, and that it was neither requisite nor proper to call
upon the company to make any specific alteration, the
mode of remedying the evil being left to their discretion
by Act of Parliament (a). So, if the writ enjoin more
than the statute authorises, it will be bad. Thus, where
a railway company were required by their Act to “make
proper watering places for cattle in all places where, by
means of the railway, the cattle of any persons occupying
lands adjacent thereto should be deprived of access to
their ancient watering places, and to supply the same with
water;” and the mandamus suggested that the company
had made their railway through and intersected eight closes
of Sir W. M., in which there were ponds or watering
places for cattle, so as to cut off the ponds from one por
tion of the closes respectively, and the writ commanded
the company “to make proper watering places for cattle
in such portions respectively of the said several closes;”
it was held that the writ was bad, as it ordered the com
pany to do more than the Act required; namely, to make
a pond in each of the portions of the closes; there being
nothing to show that one watering place would not have
been sufficient for all the portions (b).
The cases above cited are decisions on the sufficiency
and accuracy of the writ of mandamus when issued to
railway companies under the circumstances disclosed in
the several applications; it would, however, be beyond the
scope and object of this work to enter on the general sub
ject of which the above are special instances, or to attempt

any enumeration of the rules of law and practice in rela
tion to the return to a mandamus and the subsequent pro
ceedings. On these subjects, the reader is referred to the
valuable works mentioned in the note (a).
SEC. II.—Certiorari.
THE writ of certiorari is an original writ issuing from the
Crown side of the Court of Queen’s Bench, directed to the
judges or officers of inferior Courts, commanding them to
send the proceedings before them to the Court of Queen's
Bench. By means of this writ, the latter Court is enabled
to exercise its superintending jurisdiction over inferior
Courts (b). The right to issue this writ is inherent in the
Court of Queen’s Bench, and cannot be taken away by
any general, but only by express negative words (c).
With regard to the removal of any proceedings taken
in compliance with the General Railway Acts, from the
Court in which they were held to a superior Court, it is
enacted, “That no proceedings in pursuance of those or
the Special Acts, or any Acts incorporated therewith, shall
be quashed or vacated for want of form, nor removed by
certiorari or otherwise into any of the superior Courts.”
Although the right to remove proceedings had in an infe
rior Court to the Court of Queen’s Bench is in the case of
railway companies expressly taken away by statute, yet
cases may arise in which, notwithstanding such enactments,

the Court of Queen’s Bench will interfere for that purpose.
Thus, application is frequently made for a writ of certiorari
to remove an inquisition taken under a Railway Act into
the Court of Queen’s Bench, notwithstanding that the right
to the writ is taken away. These applications have been
either,first, where there was a total want of jurisdiction;
secondly, where jurisdiction substantially existed, but had
been exceeded; thirdly, where a question of jurisdiction
defectively exercised has arisen; or, fourthly, where, al
though the jurisdiction may have been perfect, yet there
has been malversation on the part of the sheriff, or other
judge of the particular tribunal.
Where an application is made to remove proceehs,
had below to the Court of Queen’s Bench on the ground
of a total want ofjurisdiction, as if the act done were locally
and visibly out of the jurisdiction, the Court of Queen’s
Bench would refuse a certiorari on the ground that the
proceedings under such circumstances in the inferior Court
could not be considered as the proceedings in any Court;
and they would thereupon leave the party to his remedy
by action. Thus, if an inquisition (in pursuance of the
provisions of a Railway Act), were held in one county to
assess the value of land in another county, the whole pro
ceedings would be void; and the inquisition before the
sheriff (which is generally made a record), would not avail
to justify the company in any action of trespass or eject
ment brought against them for an entry and possession
under such an inquisition (a).
Nor will a certiorari be granted for an irregularity in the
proceedings before the sheriff where they were originated
correctly under the Act. Thus, where the sheriff sum
moned a jury to assess damages, and at the inquiry neither
the sheriff nor the under-sheriff was present, but a clerk of
the latter, assisted by a barrister as an assessor, presided,
both of whom had been appointed by the sheriff as his

deputies for the particular purpose; and the sheriff re
turned the verdict and the judgment (purporting to have
been taken and delivered by himself), to the clerk of the
peace to be deposited among the records of the quarter
sessions; it was held that, as the proceedings originated
correctly by the warrant to the sheriff, they must be
considered as in pursuance of the Act, and were, there
fore, not removable by certiorari (a). Again, where a com
pany issued their warrant to the sheriff to summon a jury
for the purpose of inquiring of, assessing, and giving a
verdict for the sum of money, if any, to be paid to J. C. by
way of compensation, and the jury found that J. C. had
not sustained any damage; the Court refused a writ of
certiorari, as the warrant, though it ought not to have
contained the words “if any,” nevertheless gave jurisdic
tion, and made the inquisition a proceeding in pursuance
of the Act (b).
Nor will a certiorari be granted on the ground that there
has been an excess of jurisdiction; as where an application
was made to the Court to remove an inquisition held before
the sheriff on the grounds that the company had exceeded
their power in three instances:—first, by making a rail
way through a piece of land not included in the plans and
books of reference, and not certified to have been omitted
by mistake; secondly, by deviating more than one hun
dred yards from the line delineated on the plans; thirdly,
by reason that the requisition related to the damage done
to a mansion, and did not purport to have been taken by
a special jury in conformity with the Act: it was held that
the proper remedy for this excess of jurisdiction was by
action of trespass, and the Court refused to grant a cer
tiorari (c). It seems difficult to reconcile this decision

In case of
malversation.
with the principles laid down by Lord Chief Justice Den
man in the case of the Queen v. Sheffield and Ashton
under-Line and Manchester Railway Company (cited
above); in which his lordship, alluding to the argument
of counsel that, if a Court appointed to try questions of
40s. damages under an Act of Parliament containing a
clause taking away the certiorari, should choose to try a
cause in which £40,000 was in question, the jurisdiction of
the Court of Queen’s Bench would nevertheless be taken
away by the judge making a false return, says, “This Court
holds jurisdiction over all inferior Courts, and where cer
tiorari is taken away by an Act of Parliament, it must be
in the terms of the Act, and for something done in pur
suance of it; as it cannot be contended that the sheriff,
whose jurisdiction is given by the particular Act, is acting
in pursuance thereof when he proceeds to assess the value
of lands not contained in the schedules and books of re
ference, which alone the company are authorised to take;
and the clause taking away the certiorari can only be held
to have reference to cases where the provisions of the Act
are complied with—more especially where there is a clause
making the inquisition a record, and the sheriff’s return
alone evidence; and, consequently, a wrong-doer would
be protected if he could induce the sheriff to make a false
return.” The argument is of the greater weight when it is
remembered that such inquisition may be put in as an
answer to an action against the company, although not
drawn up with the same strictness as is required in ordi
nary records of inferior Courts.
But although the right to the writ of certiorari is ex
pressly taken away by statute, still the Court of Queen's
Bench will interfere in cases of malversation, as a statutory
clause taking away this right must be understood to assume
that the order or judgment in question has been the act
of the proper authority lawfully constituted; and that can
not be the proper authority where there is malversation,
or where the Court has been improperly constituted; as in
cHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 579
cases in which an interested party has presided or taken part
in the proceedings, or where the sheriff has proceeded in the
absence of the party claiming compensation; or as if, where
there were several claimants,each having a separate interest,
the amount ofcompensation for all has been assessed in one
sum. Thus, where, in a Local Act, empowering commis
sioners to make rates, but giving parties aggrieved the right
of appeal to the Court of quarter sessions, whose decision
was to be final, and not to be removed by certiorari; it
was held, that a question in the cause having been decided
by a Court improperly constituted, on account of the inte
rest of three of the magistrates, that the clause taking away
the certiorari did not apply, although the affidavit on which
the application was made did not satisfy the Court that the
interested parties had acted partially (a).
From the principles laid down in the above case we may
infer, that the Court of Queen’s Bench would remove pro
ceedings had before a sheriff who was interested in the
company, unless the party claiming damages, having notice
of the objection, appeared before such sheriff, and suffered
the inquisition to proceed, and judgment to be given
thereon, when probably it would be construed as a waiver
of the objection (b).
So, where there were several parties claimants to certain
property required for the purposes of a turnpike-road, and
a jury was summoned to find and sworn to assess the sums
to be paid to the parties for their respective estates, but
found only the gross value of the premises, the Court
ordered the inquisition to be brought up by certiorari, al
though there was a clause in the statute taking away the
certiorari (c). It has also been held by the Court of
Queen’s Bench, that the clause in an Act taking away the
certiorari does not apply to proceedings which operate

(b) Corrigal v. London and Blackwall Rail. Com. 3 Rail. Ca. 411; 5 Man.

(c) Rex v. Trustees of Walton and Norwich Road, 5 Ad. & E. 563.
580 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v1.
upon something not within the Act, though some part
may be within it, as parties are not to be allowed to
put themselves out of the reach of the Court by inserting
something in their proceedings which is within the juris
diction of their Act (a).
Where the right to a removal of the proceedings by cer
tiorari is taken away, the Court will not allow that pro
vision to be evaded by means of some interference in
another form. Thus, they will not, either on the ground
that the verdict of the jury is against evidence, or of mis
direction on the part of the sheriff, or of his refusal to hear
evidence, or that the verdict is grossly under the amount
of the damage proved, by granting a mandamus directing
a second precept to issue, do indirectly what cannot be
done directly. Thus, where an inquisition had been duly
held before the sheriff in pursuance of a precept issued
by a railway company under their Act, which declared that
the verdict should be final, and it appeared on the inqui
sition that the party claiming compensation had tendered
evidence of damage done to the growing crops on his land,
and that the sheriff had objected to the evidence on the
ground that, by another section of the Act, authority was
given to parties upon complaint made to them to award
damages in respect of the temporary occupation of land,
and withdrew that portion of the case from the considera
tion of the jury; and also where it appeared that the jury
awarded only £49 damages where the company, by their
own witnesses, had proved damage to the amount of £152;
the Court refused to grant a mandamus compelling the
company to issue a second precept (b). So, where, on an
inquisition, the jury found the value of the land £6, pre
sent damages £0, future damages £2,800, and the judg
ment entered up recited that the jury had assessed £6 for
purchase money, and no separate distinct sum for damages

London and Greenwich Rail. Com. 2 Ad, & E. 478.

before then sustained by the execution of the Act, and that
they had assessed the distinct sum to be paid for the future,
temporary, or recurring damages which should be occa
sioned by putting the Act in force at £2,800; and it was
adjudged that the undertakers should forthwith pay the
£6 and the £2,800: on application for a mandamus to
amend the judgment by striking out the award of £2,800,
on the ground that the verdict could not legally take effect
as an award of present damages under the Act, none having
been yet ascertained; it was held that, as the statute did
not allow a removal of the proceedings by certiorari, the
Court could not indirectly bring them under review by a
mandamus (a). But although the Court will refuse to inter
fere in all cases in which the interference would have the
effect of evading the clause taking away certiorari, yet
where the sheriff, or other judge of the particular tribunal,
has refused altogether to entertain the question referred
to him on the ground of a want of jurisdiction, whereby
the claimant has been deprived of the right conferred
upon him by law, the Court will by mandamus compel the
judge of such tribunal to hear and adjudicate upon the
matter submitted to him (b).
Where an indictment has been found against a com
pany at quarter sessions, or assizes, it may be removed by
certiorari into the Superior Court, in which alone the
defendants can appear and plead (c).
In order to obtain a writ of certiorari in any case, the
same strictness and accuracy is required in the title and
body of the affidavits as in an application for a mandamus.

582 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book VI.
On express
contracts,
Having in the two preceding sections noticed such pro
ceedings against a railway company as are originated by
motion in the Court of Queen’s Bench, and where the
remedy for the aggrieved party is by writ issuing out of
that Court; we now come to treat of compensatory reme
dies, or those forms of action at law by which compensation
is given to a party sustaining an injury from the breach
of any contract made by a railway company, or by the
neglect of any duty imposed upon them either by statute
or by the common law. These remedies may be divided
into those in form ex contractu, including the actions of
assumpsit, debt, and covenant; and those in form ex de
licto, comprising the actions of trespass, case, and trover.
To these may be added the action of ejectment for the
recovery of possession of land wrongfully taken. We shall
treat briefly of all of them, in their relation to the general
subject of this work, noticing under each head only such
rules and principles as seem to have a special bearing
upon railway companies.
SEC. III.—Assumpsit.
THE action of assumpsit is that which the law gives to a
party injured by the breach or non-performance of a
parol or simple contract. It is also the proper form of
action in all cases in which, although there has been
no express contract between the parties, yet the law
will, from the particular circumstances of the case, imply
One.
It was (as we have already seen (a)), for a long time
assumed, that a corporation could not contract except
under seal; and that, consequently, no action could be main
tained either by or against a corporation, in respect of a
(a) See supra, pp. 519–521.
CHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 583
simple contract, either executed or executory, unless the
contract was originally made under seal. It has, however,
been held, that assumpsit will lie against an incorporated
trading company on an executed contract, as in the case of
private individuals; and that whether the contract were
express or implied; and that the implication of a contract
may arise from the object of the incorporation as compared
with the subject matter of the contract (a). It has also been
held, that a corporation aggregate can maintain assumpsit
in respect of an executory contract(b); and in this case it was
suggested that, if the contract had remained executory,
the fact of the corporation having put it in suit would have
amounted to an admission on the record of their liability
under it, so as to preclude them from disputing such lia
bility in a cross action.
Thus, on the general principles of law, an action of as
sumpsit will lie against a railway company on all executed
simple contracts relating to the objects of the company;
such as the supply of goods, engines, carriages, and mate
rials; also for work and labour done; and it would appear
immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after
the Act of Incorporation was obtained, as all expenses in
curred in obtaining the Act, and contracts made relating
to the company, are considered as embodied in the Special
Act. The question as to the right of bringing an action of
assumpsit against a railway company is, however, conclu
sively settled by the provisions of the 8 Vic. c. 16, s. 97,
which enacts, that on any default in the execution of a
contract properly entered into, “such actions and suits may
be brought either by or against the company, as might be
brought had the same contract been made between private
persons only.”(c) Since the passing of this statute, there
fore, the only cases in which any doubt can exist as to the
(a) Beverley v. Lincoln Gas Company, 6 Ad. & E. 829.
(b) The Wardens, &c. of the Fishmonger's Company v. Robertson and
others, 5 M. & Gr. 131.
(c) See as to Contracts supra, pp. 519 and sqq.

584 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v1.
Implied con
tracts.
liability of a railway company to an action of assumpsit,
are those in which the contract sued upon has been made
by the secretary or some other agent of the company. It
may, under such circumstances, be questionable whether
an action will lie against the company on a contract so
made, whilst it remains executory; yet even in such case
it would appear that the contract could be enforced in all
cases where convenience amounting almost to necessity
required that the company should contract by parol and by
means of an agent; as in the hiring inferior servants, or
making agreements for purchase of goods, or for services,
the occasions for which are frequently recurring, or which
are too insignificant to be worth the trouble of being
made in writing under the corporate seal, or under the sig
natures of two directors, in the mode prescribed.
There is, however, no question as to the right to bring
an action of assumpsit against an incorporated trading
company, as against an individual, in those cases in which,
although there has been no express contract, the law will,
from the particular circumstances of the case, imply one.
Thus, where a railway company, who acted as common
carriers by taking the goods of parties offering them, re
fused to carry the goods of a person except upon payment
of charges higher than were demanded from others, and
the higher charges were accordingly paid under protest;
it was held, that the party aggrieved was entitled to recover
back the overcharge in an action of assumpsit for money
had and received, as the payments could not be considered
voluntary, but as made under coercion; the railway com
pany refusing, until their demands were satisfied, to per
form that service for the plaintiff which he was entitled by
law to receive from them without compliance with any such
terms (a). So, where a railway company, as owners of the
line (under an Act of Parliament (b), the construction of
(a) Parker v. Great Western Railway Com. 2 Rail. Ca. 563, 7 Scotts
N. R. 835.
(b) Barrett v. Stockton and Darlington Rail. Com. 3 M. & Gr. 956.
cHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 585
which was doubtful), charged a person a rate of toll higher
than, upon the interpretation put upon the Act by the
Court, they were authorised to charge; the party was held
entitled, in an action of assumpsit, to recover back such
overcharge; and the same remedy is available against a
railway company in all cases in which individuals have been
compelled by the company by duress of their goods, or
refusal to carry them, to pay a larger sum than they were
liable by law to pay. Where the company, as carriers or
bailees of goods, have been guilty of any neglect or other
breach of duty, whereby the goods are lost or damaged, or
inconvenience and loss are inflicted on the owner by
reason of delay in the carriage of them, an action of as
sumpsit upon their common-law liability may be main
tained against the company for the recovery of damages
by way of compensation for the injury inflicted on the
plaintiff.
SEC. IV.—Debt and Covenant.
AN action of debt will lie against an incorporated railway
company for the recovery of a debt in all those cases in
which an action of assumpsit might be maintained against
them on an executed contract, and in all those instances
in which they contract by specialty to pay money. And
even granting that a corporation cannot in general con
tract except under seal, the Court will assume, on general
demurrer to a declaration in debt, that there was a deed,
in order to support a count that the corporation was in
debted (a). So debt lies against a railway company for
work and labour done; and if the Special Act declare that
the company shall pay the expenses of obtaining the Act

Chitty on Pleading, by Greening, vol. i. p. 123.

Debt.
In what Cases

586 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v1.
out of the first monies received, it is immaterial that the
party suing was a partner at the time when the cause of
action arose (a). So debt will lie against them for goods
sold and delivered, but not for goods bargained and sold.
Debt is also the proper remedy against a company where
they contract by deed to pay money. Thus, it will lie for
the recovery of principal and interest in case of loans by
way of mortgage or bond, under the powers of the General
or Special Railway Acts; nor would the fact that the
mortgage or bond creditor has a lien upon the tolls of the
undertaking preclude him from his right to sue on his
security, though there were other bond and mortgage cre
ditors unsatisfied; the lien under the Act being an addi
tional remedy given to the creditor, and not in any way
affecting his common-law right to maintain an action (b).
In an action of debt on mortgage deeds, however, it
would appear that, although the creditor can recover
the principal at any time within twenty years after default
made, yet his remedy for arrears of interest is limited to
six years; there being no covenants or engagements to
pay the money in the form of the instruments given by
the Act, but simply a conveyance of the undertaking to
the creditor (c). So debt will lie on agreements made
under seal for the purchase of land or withdrawal of oppo
sition (d); or on the records of any of the superiorCourts,
or upon the records of a Court of Quarter Sessions. Thus,
when the judgment on an inquisition before the sheriff
for the assessment of damages in respect of lands taken or
injuriously affected by the line, has been made a record of
quarter sessions, the proper mode of proceeding against the
company for the payment of compensation is, not by an
application for a mandamus, but by action of debt on the

Ad. 545.

inquisition (a); or (where the sum has been determined by
arbitration) upon the award of the arbitrators or umpire
appointed in the manner prescribed by the 8 Vic. c. 18 (b).
Debt also will be the proper remedy against a railway
company in all cases where a statute declares that the
company shall, in a given event, pay a certain sum of
money; or where it prohibits the doingor enjoins the per
formance ofany act under a penalty or forfeiture to be paid
to the party aggrieved, and does not prescribe any other
particular mode for the recovery thereof; on this principle,
that whatever the law orders any one to pay, that instantly
becomes a debt which he hath beforehand contracted to
discharge (c). Thus, where a statute declared that a rail
way company should, in a given event, pay the trustees of
a bridge a sum not exceeding a certain amount by way of
compensation for the loss of tolls by the latter; and the
event afterwards happened, and payment was not made;
on an application for a mandamus to compel the company
to pay the money, the Court of Queen’s Bench refused to
grant one, on the ground that am action of debt would lie,
and would be equally efficacious for the applicant as the
remedy by mandamus (d). So debt would be the proper
mode of recovering the amount of compensation claimed
by a party, where the company, after notice and claim
made, in compliance with the provisions of the Act, had
failed within twenty-one days after the receipt of such
notice to issue their warrant to the sheriff to summon a
jury for the purpose of assessing the sum to be paid,
or to pay the amount demanded (e); or to recover the rent
charge in lieu of tithes in respect of lands taken by a rail
way company (f); or the chief rents secured on tolls in
lieu of payment of a sum in gross, if at any time such

rents be not paid within thirty days after they have be
come payable, and a demand in writing has been made
on the company (a).
So debt will lie against a railway company to recover
penalties imposed by statute, for the recovery of which no
other mode is specially prescribed; nor will a clause in the
statute under which the penalties are incurred, directing
that where their recovery is not otherwise provided for they
may be recovered by summary proceeding before two jus
tices, affect the right to sue for them in an action of
debt (b). Thus, debt will lie to recover penalties imposed
upon railway companies for refusing or neglecting to carry
the mails (c); or to give or renew the bond when required
by the Postmaster-General; or for opening the railway for
traffic without previous notice given to or contrary to the
order of the Commissioners of Railways (d); or for neg
lecting to give notices of accidents attended with personal
injury to any of the public (e); or to make the like returns
in case of accidents, whether attended with personal injury
or not, ifso required by the Commissioners of Railways (f);
or for not delivering returns of traffic and of tolls to the
said commissioners (g); or for disobeying their order for
conducting joint traffic of connecting railways (h); or for
refusing to run cheap trains (i); or for using engines not
consuming their own smoke (k). So it will lie for the re
covery of the penalty imposed for issuing loan-notes, or
other illegal securities (l); or for the neglect to keep copies
of the Special Act at the principal office of the company;
or for refusing liberty to inspect to parties entitled (m);

or for not depositing copies of their annual accounts with
overseers and clerks of the peace (a); or for obstructing
the supply of water and gas during the construction of
their works (b); or for neglecting to make approaches and
fences to highways crossed on the level, or to construct
screens when required by the Commissioners of Rail
ways (c); or for not repairing bridges, gates, fences, and
the like (d); or for not restoring the old or substituting
new roads within the time and in the manner prescribed;
or not properly repairing roads used by them (e); or for
entering upon and keeping possession of lands previous to
payment of compensation or deposit of the purchase-money
in the bank in the manner prescribed (f). As to the latter
point, it has been held that a company, having bond fide and
without collusion (though without complying strictly with
the requirements of the Act), paid the compensation as
sessed by the jury into the bank, and taken possession of
the land, were not liable to the penalties imposed for con
tinuance in possession of the land after notice (g).
An action of covemant, which is the remedy provided by
law for the recovery of damages for the breach of a cove
nant or contract under seal, will lie against a railway
company as in ordinary cases, and whether the covenant
be express or implied by law from the terms of the deed.
If the covenant on which the action is brought be express,
the ordinary rules of law will apply in the construction
of it; and it will rarely happen that any question can
arise as to implied covenants. With respect to the latter, it
may be right to mention that it is provided in the Lands'
Clauses Act (h) that in the conveyance of superfluous
lands sold by the company, the word ‘grant’ shall operate
as an express covenant for title, freedom from incum
brances, quiet enjoyment, and further assurance; and

SEC. V.—Case and Trespass.
IT was formerly considered doubtful whether the actions
of case, trespass, or trover, would lie against an incorpo
rated company, as it was said that a corporation aggregate
could not commit tort. In one case, however (in which
all the preceding cases were reviewed), it was decided, that
trover might be maintained against an incorporated trading
company (c); and, in a more recent case (d), that trespass
was also sustainable. Previous, however, to entering
into an inquiry as to when actions founded on torts can
be maintained against railway companies, it may be neces
sary to premise that, wherever the injury complained of is
inflicted in the execution of the powers conferred in their
Acts, no action can be brought against them, unless, in
carrying out such powers, the company have been guilty of
malice or negligence(e). The same rule holds good, although
the damage complained ofresults in part from the execution
of the powers ofthe Act, and in part otherwise. The remedy
of the party injured in such case, is either by mandamus to
compel the company to take proceedings for ascertaining the
amount of damage, or by notice to the company in the mode
prescribed by section 68 of the 8 Vic. c. 18. Were
not such protection afforded to railway companies, they
would be continually exposed to actions by reason of
unforeseen consequential damage arising to houses,

buildings, lands, gardens, &c., not comprised within their
schedules and books of reference; as by the stopping of
springs communicating with their lands, and the infliction
of other unexpected injuries against which it would be im
possible to provide (a). This principle of protection, as
applicable to public companies, has been carried so far,
that where, under an Act enabling a company to make a
canal, it was provided, that all actions, for anything done
in pursuance of the Act, should be commenced within six
calendar months after the act should have been com
mitted; and it appeared that the company, wishing to take
ground for the purpose of sloping the banks of the canal,
told the occupier, a tenant, that they had the consent of
the landowner (without which the tenant would not have
permitted them to enter), and proceeded to do the act by
which damage was done to the land, and the landlord sued
the company more than six months after the injury had
been inflicted; it was held that the action ought to have
been brought within the six months, and that the defend
ants were within the protection of the limiting clause, in
asmuch as the act complained of was really done for the
purpose contemplated by the statute, though in prosecution
of that purpose the company had been guilty of misrepre
sentation and bad faith towards the occupier (b).
The cases, therefore, in which actions in form ea delicto are
maintainable against a railway company are considerably
diminished by the protection thus afforded them by statute;
and the only instances in which the company are liable to
an action for any injury committed are, either where the
act complained of is in excess of their authority; or,
secondly, where the injury done is not the necessary and
unavoidable consequence of the execution of their works
under the powers conferred on them; or, thirdly, where,
in the execution of such powers, they are guilty of malice
or negligence; in which several instances they will be

liable in the same manner and to the same extent as
private individuals.
I. Railway companies are not protected from liability for
the consequences of any proceeding not within the scope
of their authority, and not justified by their Act. Thus,
they will be liable to an action of trespass at the suit of
the party in possession, or to an action on the case by the re
versioner, for entering on and taking possession of lands not
contained in the schedules and books of reference; or for
entering upon such lands as they are authorised by their Act
to take, previous to payment of the amount of compensation,
or deposit thereof according to the provisions of the 8 Vic.
c. 18, s. 84; excepting when they enter for the mere pur
pose of surveying and setting out the line, or making trial,
holes, and boring; and so (in addition to the penalties to
which a railway company is exposed for neglecting to make
a sufficient substituted road previous to interfering with any
existing one), they will be liable to an action on the case for
any special damagewhich any party entitled to a right of way
may sustain through their default(a). So an action of tres
pass and false imprisonment may be brought against them
for the unlawful apprehension and detainer of any person.
Thus, when a company has neglected to construct the neces
sary communications for the owners of lands adjoining and
severed by the railway, they are not entitled to put in force
against them their powers of apprehending parties for
trespassing on the line; nor may they, so long as the re
quired communications are not provided, apprehend and
detain as a trespasser any landowner crossing the line
within the limits of his own land, either by himself or ser
vants (b). Where, however, the owner or occupier of such
lands has, by arrangement with the company, received
compensation for any such communications instead of their

being made, or has been compensated for his land on the
principle of an absolute severance, the company may detain
him if he trespass upon the railway (a). So trespass will
lie against them for apprehending a person under a bye
law which provides, that any party not producing his ticket
at the end of his journey shall be liable to pay the fare for
the whole distance from the place whence the train started
to that in which he leaves it, for the class of carriage in
which he has travelled. Thus, where, under such circum
stances, a party refused to pay for the whole distance which
the train had passed over, but tendered the fare for the
number of miles he had actually travelled, and he was
thereupon taken into custody; it was held that the com
pany could not justify the trespass under such a bye-law,
and that the arrest was illegal, and that the bye-law was
not properly described as one imposing a penalty or for
feiture. It was also intimated (b), that even had it imposed
a penalty or forfeiture, still it was bad for unreasonable
ness; and that under the Act of Incorporation of the com
pany no power was given to them to apprehend a person,
except for an offence against the Act of Parliament itself;
that they had no such authority to apprehend for an in
fringement of a bye-law of the company not in any way
affecting public safety or convenience (c).
II. Where, in the execution of works authorised by a
Railway Act, an injury is inflicted which is not the neces
sary consequence of the works, and which might have been
avoided by a different mode of carrying them on, the party
injured has his remedy by an action for damages, and the
company are not protected from their liability by the pro
visions of their statute, that only authorising them to

pears doubtful whether a railway company can apprehend a person trespassing
on the line, unless the party either refuse to quit the same on request (3 & 4
Vic, c, 97, s. 16), or the name and residence of the party be unknown to the
officer of the company (8 Vic. c. 20, s. 154).

execute their works, “doing as little damage as possible;”
and leaving them responsible as in ordinary cases for
wanton injuries. Thus, where a company were empowered
by their Act to pull down certain houses that were sche
duled therein, and compensation clauses were added for
persons damaged or injured by the taking down of any of
the buildings for the purposes or otherwise in the execu
tion of the Act; and the company purchased a house not
mentioned in the schedule, and in pulling it down injured
the adjoining building; it was held, that the tenant of the
adjoining house was not entitled to recover compensation
by the process provided by the Act for injuries inflicted
in the execution of it, but that the remedy (if any)
was by an action on the case. So an action on the case
will lie against a railway company at the suit of the
reversioner of a house, erected before the passing of the
Special Act, and not specified in the schedules and books
of reference, for damage done to it by the obstruction of
its lights by a railway station erected by the company
under the Act, and by the dust drifted from the station
and embankment into the house; and it was held that
the plaintiff was not bound to come in under the compen
sation clause (a). It is also submitted that, in all cases in
which injury is inflicted on a party by the execution of
railway works, which might have been avoided by a dif
ferent mode of carrying them on, the company will be
liable to an action on the case; for it is only where the
damage done is the necessary and direct result of the exe
cution of the powers conferred in their Act that the in
jured party is entitled to come in under the compensation
clause; and that for all avoidable mischief, therefore, the
company are responsible in the ordinary way like other
parties.
III. Although a railway company are protected from lia
bility to actions in respect of all proceedings taken in pursu
ance of the provisions of the General and Special Acts, still,
(a) Turner and others v. The Sheffield and Rotherham Rail. Com. 10 M.
& W. 425.
CHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 595
even when acting within the scope of the powers therein con
ferred, they are not protected from responsibility for the
consequences of any injury done to the person or property
of a party, resulting from malice or negligence; and their
liability in such case attaches, although the mischief were
occasioned by some wrongful act or omission on the part of
the persons employed by them, for incorporated companies
are answerable for the tortious acts of their servants, al
though they were not appointed under seal, if the act or
omission complained of were in the ordinary course of their
service and employment (a). For these purposes, a contractor
is deemed to be a servant of the company, so as to make
them responsible for his malice or negligence (b).
The company, however, are not liable for felonies, or
crimes involving personal violence, when their servants are
acting altogether out of the scope of their employment, and
not in execution of the duties delegated to them. Nor
are the directors of a company individually liable for acts
done in their corporate capacity, and from which any de
triment arises; at all events, in the absence of proof of
malice on the part of the individual director (c).
The following are instances of the nature and extent of
the liability cast upon public companies for malicious or
negligent conduct of their works, whereby injury is done
to a third party.
Thus, where, in the construction of their line, a railway
company made excavations near to the house of the plaintiff,
and proceeded in so careless a manner that, owing to their
neglectofproperprecaution,thehousegavewayandfelldown,
an action on thecasewas held maintainable against them (d).

So, again, where a company, in making excavations for gas
pipes, negligently left the works open and unprotected,
whereby the plaintiff fell in, and suffered considerable in
jury. So, where the stacks of the plaintiff were set on fire
and burnt by means of a hot cinder thrown from a loco
motive engine belonging to the company, and, an action
being brought against them, it appeared that the engines
and boilers were such as were usually employed on rail
ways, and were used at the time of the accident in the
ordinary manner, and for lawful purposes; whereupon it
was contended by the defendants that they were not liable,
and that the plaintiff ought to be non-suited, unless he
could show negligence on the part of the company; it was,
nevertheless, held, that the fact of a fire having been caused
by a spark from their steam-engine, was primá facie evi
dence of negligence, and that the company were liable in
an action on the case (a). Hence, the fact that the mis
chief is caused in the course of using the railway in the
ordinary manner, and in obedience to and for purposes
authorised by the provisions of their Act, does not exone
rate the company from liability to indemnify a party in
jured; it being a general principle of law that each person
must so use his own property as not to injure that of an
other. Moreover, the company are bound to adopt all
reasonable precautions against the occurrence of accidents;
and if, through any want of such precautions (as the fixing
of a cap on the funnel of an engine, the providing of a fire
plate, shutting off the steam, or the like), damage is done
to the person or property of another, there is positive proof
of negligence on their part sufficient to make them liable
for the consequences (b). It is only in case of accidents
strictly inevitable that they are exempted from liability.
So, although there be no direct statutory obligation on a

CHAP. II.] REMEDIES, 597
company to do, or omit doing, a particular act, still there
may be a common-law duty thrown upon them, which
will render them liable to an action on the case for the
consequences of omission or commission. Thus, as a rail
way company make the line for their own profit, and open
it to the public on the payment of a toll, the common law
casts an obligation upon them to take care that, so long as
they keep it open for the use of the public, all who come
upon it may do so without damage to their lives or pro
perty; and an action on the case will lie against them for
any injury sustained by a party arising from an obstruction
on the road, or from the rails being improperly laid, or not
kept in sufficient repair (a). So, as the company are bound
to provide and to keep in proper repair the fences adjoin
ing the railway, in order to prevent cattle from trespassing
on the line, an action on the case will lie against them at
the suit of the owner for an injury caused to cattle straying
on to the railroad by reason of defective or insufficient
fencing (b).
Again, although a railway company are not bound by
their Act of Incorporation to become common carriers(c) or
carriers of passengers, and they may altogether refuse to
carry either passengers or goods; still, if they once elect
to become such, the common-law liability of carriers
attaches to them; and they are not entitled, when sued
for negligence or fraud in that character, to any of the
privileges conferred upon them by their statute, in respect
of notice of action or otherwise; it having been held, on
the construction of several special statutes, that incorpo
rated companies can only claim a right to notice of action,
and the like, where they are sued for anything done or
omitted to be done in pursuance of their Act, and not
where they are sued as common carriers (d). Thus, an

action on the case will lie against them for any injury done
to the goods and merchandise of parties sending them on
the line(a); and it would be immaterial that the declaration
alleged them to be the owners and proprietors of the
railway. So they would be liable for the loss of a pas
senger's luggage, provided it consisted bond fide of articles
of dress, or the ordinary baggage of a traveller, and not
of merchandise (b); and it would be immaterial whether
the injury was caused by the improper construction of the
carriage in which the goods were placed, or the improper
position of the carriage in the train (c); or whether they
were destroyed by fire in consequence of not being suffi
ciently protected. So, case will lie against the company
for any injury sustained by a passenger arising from their
neglect as owners of the line; as in not keeping it in proper
repair (d), or from the negligence or misfeasance of their
servants, as in cases of collision, or of injury sustained in
consequence of furious driving; and althcugh the com
pany, as carriers of passengers, are not insurers at all
events, yet very slight evidence of negligence will be suffi
cient to render them liable for the consequences of an
accident, either to the party injured, or, if death ensue, to his
personal representatives. For it is provided by a recent Act
of Parliament (e), that, if death ensue in consequence ofany
such accident, an action for damages will lie against the com
pany at the suit of the personal representatives of the de
ceased, for the benefit of certain parties specified in the Act.
So, in addition to their liability to convey and carry goods
entrusted to them, and persons travelling on the line, in
safety, they are also bound to receive and carry all goods
offered for conveyance, and all passengers desirous of pro
ceeding; and an action on the case will lie against them

for any refusal (a), unless they have a reasonable and law
ful excuse for their refusal; as that the goods were of a dan
gerous nature, and improper to be carried on the line; or
that they were offered at an unseasonable time; or that the
money for carriage was refused; or that the party desirous
to proceed was not in a fit state to travel, due considera
tion being had to the convenience of other passengers; or
that he would not pay the fare; or that the train was full.
As regards the pre-payment of tolls and fares, it is not
necessary, in order to have a right of action against a
company for refusing to carry either goods or passengers,
that a strictly legal tender of the money for their convey
ance should have been made, it being sufficient if the
parties were ready and willing to pay all proper demands(b).
As a railway company are only entitled to claim reasonable
eharges in respect of goods offered to them for conveyance,
and as such charges must be made equally on all parties,
any refusal by a party to pay charges that are either un
reasonable or unequal will not justify a company in refusing
to convey (c).
Before dismissing this branch of our subject, we must
observe, that into each of the three General Railway Acts
a clause is introduced authorising a railway company, in
certain cases, to tender amends for injuries inflicted in the
execution of the powers of their Act; or to pay money
into Court in an action brought to recover damages against
them for some irregularity, trespass, or other wrongful
proceeding (d). The privilege conferred in these several
clauses is given in comprehensive terms:—“If any party
shall have committed any irregularity, trespass, or other
wrongful proceeding in the execution of this or the Special
Act, or any Act incorporated therewith, or by virtue of

any power or authority thereby given; and if, before action
brought in respect thereof, such party make tender of suffi
cient amends to the party injured, such last-mentioned
party shall not recover in any such action; and if no such
tender shall have been made, it shall be lawful for the de
fendant, by leave of the Court where such action shall be
pending, at any time before issue joined, to pay into Court
such sum of money as he shall think fit; and thereupon
such proceedings shall be had as in other cases where de
fendants are allowed to pay money into Court.” It is
submitted, that these privileges are conferred upon a com
pany (like that of notice of action), only in relation to
things done or omitted in the execution of the powers of
their Act; that is, in cases in which some duty imposed
upon them has been neglected, or some right conferred on
them has been irregularly exercised. Where, therefore,
the ground of complaint against them is something closely
connected with their powers and obligations as an incor
porated company, they are entitled to the protection above
mentioned. But that protection does not extend to cases in
which wrongs have been committed by them even in relation
to matters within the scope of their authority, except where
the company, although acting erroneously, have yet acted
bond fide with a view to carry out the powers of the Act.
Any malice or malá fides in doing or omitting anything pre
scribed by their Act, will exclude them from the benefit of
the clauses under consideration, and will leave them respon
sible as private individuals for mischief and injury resulting
therefrom. So, where the wrongful act or omission occurred
in connection with the company’s business as common
carriers, they are not entitled to tender amends or to pay
money into Court under the sections above cited; their Act
not casting upon them the obligation of becoming carriers,
but only giving them liberty to become such ; and the
ground of complaint, therefore, not arising from the exe
cution of the powers of the Act (a).

SEC. VI.—Trover.
TRover is a special action on the case, which may be main
tained by any person who has either an absolute or special
property in goods, for the recovery of the value of such
goods, against another who, having, or being supposed to
have, obtained possession of such goods by lawful means,
has wrongfully converted them to his own use (a). This
action may be maintained against a corporation (), and
will lie, therefore, against a railway company, who may be
guilty of a conversion by the act of their servant; in which
case the value of the goods may be recovered in this form
of action after a notice to the company to deliver them.
The cases in which trover is most commonly brought
against a railway company, are those in which the com
pany, either as carriers or owners of the line, have detained
the goods of a party for arrears of tolls or charges; or
where, in the course of the construction of the line, they
claim a lien on all the tools, materials, and implements
brought on to the works by the contractor, under some
special contract, to the effect that should the contractor
either become bankrupt or insolvent, or fail to proceed in
the execution of the works to the satisfaction ofthe engineer
of the company, after due notice, complaining of any irre
gularity, has been served on such contractor, the company’s
lien should attach. If such a provision has been inserted
in the contract, and, whilst the execution of the contract
is yet incomplete, the contractor should become insolvent
or bankrupt, the question of title to the goods and im
plements will be raised between the railway company
and the assignees, in an action of trover. So, where goods
are seized under a claim of lien for tolls, they are recover
able in this form of action. Thus, where the agent of an
incorporated canal company had, under the powers con

ferred by their Act, seized the barges and coal of the plaintiff
for toll claimed to be due, it was held that trover was main
tainable against the company on their refusal to deliver
the goods after notice given to them to that effect (a).
So, where a railway company become common carriers,
they are liable as such for any wrongful delivery of goods
entrusted to them. Thus, they will be liable to an action
of trover for delivering goods elsewhere than where they
were addressed (b), although such misdelivery has occurred
by mistake only (c).
But where they detain goods upon which they have a
lien, they will not be liable to an action of trover until such
lien is satisfied. Yet it is not necessary, in such case, in
order to entitle the plaintiff to recover, that he should
prove an actual tender of the carriage money, if it appear
he was ready to pay it (d). Under the head of lien, a ques
tion of considerable importance arises as to how far the
right of lien claimed by a railway company for tolls ex
tends, in the case of goods which have been entrusted by
different persons to a common carrier, who forwards them
by their line of railway; whether under such circum
stances the company have an indivisible lien on all the
goods forwarded by such carrier for the balance due from
him, or whether the lien is divisible, so that each indi
vidual owner, by tendering a reasonable sum for the
carriage of his own goods, would be entitled to maintain
trover against the company on their refusal to deliver them.
It would appear from the judgment ofMr. Baron Parke(e),
that each owner of goods could, in such case, maintain
trover against the company, although it was held doubtful
whether each owner could maintain an action by the custom

of England in respect of his own goods, as the relation of em
ployerand carrier could not have subsisted betweenthemand
the company, but only between them and the carriers whom
they employed. The right of lien can only arise on the foot
ing that some work has been done to the goods on a contract,
either express or implied; and it is submitted that, if the
contract as between the company and the carrier, is to be
considered as one and indivisible in itself, it must be so in
the nature of the rights which it confers, and hence must
be deemed indivisible in respect of the lien claimed under
it; and, therefore, that the company, having a lien upon
the whole of the goods, would have a right to detain them
all until their claim against the carrier was discharged.
An action of trover will lie against a railway company by
the assignees of a contractor who has become bankrupt,
where the company, claiming a lien on the tools, imple
ments, and materials belonging to such contractor, have
taken possession of them, either after the title of the
assignees is completed by an Act of Bankruptcy on the
part of the contractor, and before the right of the company
in consequence of the bankruptcy has accrued; or where
the right is claimed under an agreement which may be
construed as a violation of the Bankrupt or Insolvent
Laws; or where, having once had a lien on the particular
goods, they have lost such lien by parting with the posses
sion of them; or where they have taken and seized the goods
before they came into their possession, either actual or con
structive,
Thus, in a contract between the company and a builder,
there was a clause that, in case the builder should become
insolvent or bankrupt, or should, from any cause whatever,
other than the Act of the company, be prevented from pro
ceeding with the works, it should be lawful for the com
pany to give him a notice in writing requiring him to pro
ceed with the works; and that, in case he should for seven
days after such notice make default, it should be lawful
for the company to employ other workmen; and that all
R R 2
604 RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book VI.
the tools and materials delivered for the purpose of the
works thereby contracted for, being upon and about the site
thereof, should, upon such default, become and be in all
respects as the property of the company. The company
gave a notice to proceed with the works on the 11th of
April, and the contractor committed an Act of Bankruptcy
on the 17th. In an action of trover by the assignees of
the bankrupt to recover the tools and materials which had
been seized by the company, it was held that the right of
the company did not accrue until after the Act of Bank
ruptcy, and, consequently, the right to the property vest
ing on that day in the assignees by relation, the company
were bound to give it up (a). So the company would be
liable to an action of trover if they took possession of goods
under the terms of an agreement made in violation of the
spirit and policy of the Bankrupt or Insolvent Laws; and
it is submitted that the agreement above set out in Roach
v. The Great Western Railway Company was one under
which the defendants could not have been relieved from
their liability to an action of trover at the suit of the
assignees, even if the title of the latter, by relation back to
the time of the commission of the Act of Bankruptcy, had
not supervened previous to the right of the company being
completed; as Lord Abinger, in Tripp v. Armytage, says:
“Supposing these to be manufactured goods, and in the
possession of the bankrupt at the time of his bankruptcy,
the question is, whether the contract that he has made,
that such goods shall become in case of his bankruptcy
the property of other parties, if they so choose, is a bind
ing contract on his assignees. I think it is not. The
bankrupt has no power to make a contract which, after his
bankruptcy, shall vest in other persons the property which
upon his bankruptcy vested in his assignees. At the
moment of the Act of Bankruptcy, the assignees are en
titled to all he was then possessed of; and yet it is not till

CHAP. II.] REMEDIES. 605
then that the defendants are to exercise an option whether
they will take the property or not.”
If, however, the contract was, not that the materials
and implements should vest absolutely in the company in
case of bankruptcy or insolvency, but merely that the com
pany should have alien upon them for the due performance
of the contract, the assignees would only take the goods
subject to such lien, and could not maintain trover against
the company; (at all events, as to the implements and
materials that were brought upon the premises of the
company,) until the lien had been satisfied. Thus, in a
contract similar to the above, it was agreed that if, in the
opinion of the architect, the contractor should not proceed
with sufficient expedition, the company might employ other
or additional workmen to complete the works, giving seven
days’ notice of such intention; and in such cases might
use the cranes, machines, implements, and materials, used
on or about the said works by the contractors, who were
to defray the extra expense so incurred; and that the
company should have a lien upon such machines, imple
ments, and materials as should, for the time being, be in
and upon the lands, as a security for the completion of the
bridge. In an action of trover against the company for the
recovery of certain implements, it appeared that the goods
for which the action was brought were of four different
classes. First, those actually upon the line of railway;
secondly, those not upon land actually belonging to the
company, although inclosed and temporarily occupied by
them; thirdly, goods deposited upon the line of temporary
railway made by the bankrupts on lands not belonging to
the company for the convenience of conveying materials;
fourthly, goods not on the property of the company in any
way. It was held that there was nothing unlawful in the
stipulations of the agreement as to the lien of the company
upon the implements brought upon their lands as a secu
rity for the due performance of the works; and that the
lien of the company extended to such goods as came upon
RAILWAY COMPANIES. [Book v1.
the lands required for the line, or temporarily occupied
by them; and, consequently, that they had a lien on the
first and second classes, but not upon the third and fourth;
which, nevertheless, after the expiration of the notice, they
had a right to retain and use about the works (a).
SEC. VII.—Ejectment.
“THIs is an action which lies for the recovery of the pos
session of real property in which the lessor of the plaintiff
has the legal interest and a possessory right not barred by
the Statute of Limitations” (b).
An action of ejectment will lie against a railway com
pany for.the recovery of the possession of real property in
the same manner and to the same extent as against a pri
vate individual. Therefore, if a railway company enter
upon and take possession of any lands that they are not
authorised by their Act to take—such as lands not in
cluded in the plans and books of reference; or if they
enter upon and take possession of any lands which they
are authorised to take, but in respect of which they have
neglected to comply with the preliminaries prescribed by
the Special and General Railway Acts—as to the giving of
the notice to treat; the paying the amount of compensation
to the party entitled, or depositing the same in the bank;
the requiring the party to make out his title, and the like;
the property may be recovered in an action of ejectment.
In a word, this action will lie against a company if they
enter upon any lands previous to the perfecting of their
title in the mode pointed out by the Legislature, and they
will be liable to be ejected by the party who has the legal
interest and possessory right.

CHAP. 11.] REMEDIES. 607
A Railway Act provided that if the owner of any lands,
on tender of the purchase-money agreed or awarded to be
paid, refuse to accept the same, or fail to make out title
to the lands (in respect whereof the money was payable),
to the satisfaction of the company; it shall be lawful for
the company to deposit the purchase-money in the Bank
of England to the credit of the parties interested; and
thereupon all interest in such lands should vest absolutely
in the company. It appeared that, previous to the inquiry
before the sheriff, the owner of the lands, on request being
made to him for that purpose, refused to disclose his title;
but no such application was made afterward, nor was he
again required to make out a title, but the purchase-money
was deposited in the Bank of England, and the company
proceeded to take possession of the land. It was held that
the failure to make out title previous to the inquisition was
not such a failure as to entitle the company to pay the
money into the bank, and enter upon the lands; but that
it was their duty to have called upon the party after the
compensation had been ascertained by the verdict of the
jury, to make out his title to the land, if he were disposed
to accept the amount so settled; and that the company,
having neglected to comply strictly with the provisions of
their Act of Parliament, had no parliamentary title to the
land; and thus, having neither a conveyance from the
owner nor a title under the statute, they could not hold
the land as against the lessor of the plaintiff, who was
entitled, therefore, to recover back possession of the land
in an action of ejectment (a).
This action can be maintained in all cases in which there
is what amounts to an ouster or actual dispossession of the
lessor of the plaintiff, and an adverse or illegal possession
of the defendant at the time of the demise laid in the de
claration. It will lie, therefore, at the suit of one tenant
in common against his co-tenants, if the former be pre

vented by the latter from occupying the property in ques
tion; but in general the mere receipt of all the profits by
the latter will not amount to an ouster (a). On the prin
ciples above laid down, an action of ejectment may be
maintained against a railway company, although the lessor
of the plaintiff be tenant in common with the defendants
of the premises in question. In such a case, where three
of the defendants defended as landlords, and the others as
tenants, and the usual special rule admitting the landlords
to defend and to admit ouster in case actual ouster should
be proved had been obtained; and at the trial it appeared
that rent had formerly been paid to all the tenants in
common for the premises by certain other persons, and
there was no evidence that that tenancy had been deter
mined; it was held that those who defended as tenants were
not precluded by the landlords rule from contending that
the lessor of the plaintiff had no legal title to the posses
sion on the day of the demise, as the previous tenancy
might still exist. It further appeared that the premises in
question had been pulled down, and their site taken pos
session of by a railway company, one of the tenants in com
mon, and a railway constructed thereon; and the Court
intimated an opinion that such a dealing with the property
by the company amounted to an actual ouster of another
tenant in common of the premises sufficient to entitle him
to maintain an action of ejectment against them (b).
But where a company had power to borrow money on
the credit of the undertaking, and to assign and charge the
property of the undertaking and the rates and tolls as a secu
rity for the money borrowed, and by the mortgage-deed they
assigned to the mortgagee, his executors, administrators,
and assigns, “the said undertaking, and all and singular
the rates, tolls, and other sums arising by virtue of the
Act, and all the estate, right, title, and interest of, in, and

to the same;” it was held, in ejectment brought by a mort
gagee, that the lands of the company were not included in
the mortgage under the word undertaking, and did not pass
by such mortgage, and that ejectment would not lie to re
cover possession of them under the deed (a).
In moving for judgment against the casual ejector in an
action of ejectment against a railway company, service of
the declaration on the clerk of the company, at the place
of business of the company, will be sufficient for a rule
nisi (b). So, in a similar case, service of the declaration
on the company’s book-keeper, who was in possession of,
and slept on part of the premises, was held sufficient for a
rule absolute in the first instance (c).

CRIMINAL AND OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST A RAILWAY
COMPANY.,
SEC. I.-Indictment.
WE have already seen (a) that actions in form er delicto
may be maintained against corporate bodies for torts of a
personal nature committed by them; and that case, tres
pass, and trover, are remedies available against them under
circumstances which would have made those actions suit
able in ordinary cases, and where the wrongs complained
of had been committed by a private individual. Nor are
corporations liable only in civil actions; they are also an
swerable criminally; and indictments will lie against them
at Common Law for misdemeanors and omissions of the
duty cast upon them in their corporate character. A cor
poration aggregate, however, can only be indicted in their
corporate name for non-feasances, and not for misfeasances.
In the latter case, where some wrongful act has been done,
the individuals (whether servants of the company or not),
who have actually taken part in it, are alone responsible in
this form (b). But for neglect and breach of duty by
omission, a corporation may be indicted (c).
Hence, railway companies may be indicted by their name
of incorporation for disobedience to an order of justices.
Thus, where a Railway Act, authorising the company to

take lands for the purposes of the line, provided “that,
when the company shall take any land for the purposes of
the Act, they shall forthwith make and erect, and from
time to time maintain, such and so many bridges, &c.,
over, under, &c., the railway, of such dimensions and in
such manner as two or more justices shall, upon applica
tion of the owner or occupier of any lands, judge neces
sary and appoint;” and an order had been made by two
justices on the company, requiring them to make an arch
under the railway for the convenience of the lands in ques
tion; which order was confirmed, upon appeal, by the
quarter sessions; and a bill of indictment for disobeying
this order was preferred and found against the company
by their corporate name; it was held good on demurrer,
and judgment passed for the Crown (a).
So a railway company may be indicted for any neglect
or refusal to perform an act enjoined by their statute, if
the omission be such as affects the interests of the public.
Thus, indictments will lie against them for the neglect to
construct, in compliance with the provisions of the Act,
bridges and viaducts on the line, or for neglecting to main
tain them in repair, whereby the safety or convenience of
the public may be affected (b). So, for an omission to
keep the line in an efficient state by the renewal of rails,
chairs, and sleepers, when required; as the public, who are
entitled to the use of it as of a public highway, on pay
ment of the prescribed tolls, are incommoded and endan
gered by any such want of repair (c). So, for a neglect to
provide and maintain screens for turnpike roads in places
where directed by the Commissioners of Railways (d).

vants, in obedience to their orders and in execution of the
powers conferred in the Special Act, then an indictment
can be preferred only against the actual wrong-doer.
Hence, where a company, in constructing their line, had
diverted a highway and obstructed the old road by build
ing a wall across it, before they had, as required by their
Act, made a substituted road as convenient as the old one,
or as near thereto as might be; a bill of indictment, in
the common form for obstructing the highway, was pre
ferred and found, not against the company, but against
the engineer and the contractors, who were found guilty
and fined for the misdemeanor (a). The distinction
above mentioned, (and recognised in the cases to be
found in the books upon this subject,) between misfea
sance and nonfeasance, touching the liability of a com
pany to indictment, is one not always easy to be drawn.
It may frequently happen that the ground of complaint
against the company is one which may be described with
equal propriety as the commission of a wrongful act or the
omission of a prescribed duty; and in such cases the re
sponsibility may be shifted from the corporation to their
servants, and an indictment be preferred against the one
or the other as the misdemeanor is regarded in the light
of a misfeasance or a nonfeasance. Thus, in the familiar
instance of a bridge, to carry a line of railway over a road,
not built in accordance with the requirements of the Act;
as by not being of adequate height or width, it seems in
different, in point of legal propriety, whether it be treated
as a neglect or omission of the duty cast upon the com
pany by their Act, or as a wrongful obstruction of the road
across which the bridge has been thrown. Yet, on the
principles above laid down, the one view would render the
engineer and contractors liable; the other, the company.
A shifting or alternative responsibility seems thus to arise;
and indeed a double liability might be contended for, by
considering the ground of complaint both negatively as an
(a) Reg. v. Scott and others, 3 Rail. Ca. 187; 3 Q. B. 543.
CHAP. III.] REMEDIES. 613
omission of duty, and affirmatively as the commission of a
wrong,
Admitting, however, the validity of the distinction thus
taken, it is necessary to remark, that the obligation, a
breach of which is complained of, must be one that con
cerns the public, in order to make the company liable to
indictment. Therefore, it lies against a corporation for
non-repair of a creek (a), or the banks of a river (b), or
sea-walls (c); and against a railway company for non-repair
of their line, or for non-observance of provisions intro
duced into the Act for securing the public safety. But
for a breach of duty, where the obligation affects only the
members of the incorporation, the company are not indict
able; although individuals who suffer injury by the default
may sue in tort, and recover damages against the com
pany for the omission complained of And even where the
wrong affects more immediately the interests of a private
party, so as to give him a right of action against the com:
pany, yet, if the public interests are also affected, an indict
ment may be maintained. Thus, in many instances, a
railway company may render themselves responsible both
civilly at the suit of an individual for the private damage,
and criminally at the suit of the Crown for the public
injury. But if the public interests are not at all affected,
no indictment can be preferred. Where the injury is not
specific, but general, the remedy is by indictment; where
it is definite and limited to individuals, an action may be
brought; where it is one which both causes special damage
to individuals and incommodes or endangers the public,
then both action and indictment may be maintained (d).
Where a bill of indictment has been preferred and found,
either at assizes or quarter sessions, against a railway com
pany, it is necessary to remove it into the Court of Queen's

Bench by certiorari, in order that the company may appear
and plead, which they cannot do in the Court below; an
appearance in person being necessary to a plea in those
Courts, and a corporation being impersonal, and not, there
fore, capable of so appearing. But on removal to the supe
rior Court, the company can appear and plead by their
attorney; after which, the trial and the subsequent pro
ceedings may be had as in ordinary cases. If, however,
no appearance be entered, the company may be compelled
to appearby a process called “distress infinite,” to be issued
against them out of the Court of Queen’s Bench (a).
SEc. II.—Summary Proceedings.
THE remedies against a railway company heretofore men
tioned, are such as consist of actions or suits instituted
against them in the superior Courts; or of such as are to
be obtained only by application to those Courts on mo
tion; or of prosecution by indictment at the quarter ses
sions or the assizes. In addition, however, to these more
solemn modes of proceeding, which are usually both tedious
and expensive, and which cannot be adopted except in
cases where the gravity of the wrong inflicted or of the
right invaded, and the serious nature of the results flowing
from the conduct complained of, abundantly justify the
setting in motion these higher processes of the law, the
General and Special Railway Acts provide a more prompt
and efficacious plan of proceeding in the case of those minor
irregularities and offences which may cause much annoy
ance and damage to the parties against whom they are
committed, and for which, nevertheless, relief cannot be
prudently sought by the higher forms of legal procedure
above noticed; the cost of which is certain and considerable,
whilst their issue must always be more or less doubtful.
(a) Reg. v. Birmingham & Gloucester Rail. Com.9 Car. & P. 478; 3 Rail.
Ca. 148.
CHAP. III.] REMEDIES. 615
These more summary remedies are provided both for the
recovery of debts and demands in certain cases, and of
penalties incurred, and for the enforcement of statutory
duties and obligations. There are also certain miscellaneous
cases in which the actual interference of public officers, or
of the parties interested, is authorised either to execute or
to abate and remove works connected with the railway.
We shall notice the nature and application of these reme
dies. First, where money is due from a railway company,
and they neglect or refuse to pay it; secondly, where
breaches of duty are to be proved, and penalties enforced,
against them before justices; and, thirdly, where the in
terference of the parties is allowed without legal process.
I. The General Railway Acts specify certain cases in
which a money-demand against a company may be en
forced without the formalities, delay, and expense of an
action at law. Thus, the statute 7 & 8 Vic. c. 85, s. 22,
provides that payment of arrears of tithe commutation
rent-charges may be enforced against a railway company
at the expiration of twenty-one days after they have accrued
due and remained unpaid, by distress against the goods,
chattels, and effects of the company, whether on the lands
charged with the tithe or on other lands of the company;
in the same manner as a landlord might distrain upon his
tenant for arrears of rent due on a lease for years.
So, where lands have been purchased for the purposes
of the Special Act, not for a sum in gross, but for an annual
rent-charge payable out of the tolls and rates to be received
by the company, and such rents are in arrear and unpaid
for thirty days after they become due, the parties entitled
to them may levy the amount by distress of the goods and
chattels of the company (a).
So, in all cases where any damages, costs, or expenses
are, by the General or Special Acts, directed to be paid,
and the method of ascertaining the amount or enforcing

company,

case of dispute, is to be ascertained and determined by
two justices; and if the amount so ascertained be not paid
by the company within seven days after demand, it may
be recovered by distress of the goods of the company; and
the justices by whom the sum shall have been ordered to
be paid, or either of them, on application, may issue a
warrant for that purpose (a). In the same manner, the
taxed costs of an inquiry before the sheriff, payable by the
company, are recoverable, if they are unpaid seven days
after demand (b).
In all cases in which a party is entitled to this remedy,
by distress of the goods, chattels, and effects of the com
pany, for the recovery of any costs, damages, or expenses,
ordered to be paid by them, if sufficient goods of the com
pany cannot be found whereon to levy the amount, the
same may, if it do not exceed £20, be recovered by distress
of the goods of the treasurer of the company (c). Seven
days notice, however, of the amount due, and a demand
of payment, must be made previous to the execution of the
warrant of distress. Any money paid by the treasurer
under such circumstances, together with costs incurred,
may be retained by him out of the funds of the company
coming into his control or custody, or he may sue the com
pany for the same (d).
Where the amount of any costs, charges, or expenses,
to be recovered as above, is directed to be ascertained by
one or more justices, any justice, on the application of
either party, may summon the other party to appear before
one or more justices (as the case may be); and on their
appearance, or on proof of the due service of the summons,
such justice or justices may proceed to hear and determine
the question, and for that purpose may examine the parties
and their witnesses upon oath. The costs of this inquiry,

both in respect of their amount and the party to pay them,
are to be in the discretion of the justices (a).
Where a breach of duty, or any irregularity or offence
against some penal clause of the General or Special Rail
way Acts has been duly proved against a company, and
they have been formally convicted (as mentioned below)
on summons or information, and the amount of the penalty
has been adjudged, the same may, together with the costs
(if not forthwith paid), be levied by distress of the goods of
the company, as in the cases before alluded to (b), if
no other mode for its recovery has been specially pro
vided.
No distress levied by virtue of the provisions of the
General or Special Railway Acts is to be deemed unlawful,
nor is any party making it to be deemed a trespasser, on
account of any defect or want of form in the summons,
conviction, warrant of distress, or other proceeding relating
thereto; nor is such party to be deemed a trespasser ab
initio on account of any irregularity afterwards committed
by him; but the company, if aggrieved thereby, may re
cover full satisfaction for the special damage in an action
on the case (c).
Penalties enforced and exacted as above (if no other
mode of applying them has been specially provided), are
to be disposed of by the justices; who may award not more
than half to the informer, and the remainder to the over
seers of the poor of the parish in which the offence was
committed (d).
Such penalties, however, as are incurred for offences
committed within the metropolitan police district, must be
recovered, enforced, accounted for, and (except where the
application thereof is otherwise specially provided for), paid
to the receiver of the metropolitan police district, to be

By appoint- In addition to the remedy by distress thus given to the
£f" creditors of a railway company, and to parties interested
in the enforcement of penalties, it is provided by the Com
panies' Clauses Act (b), that wherever the Special Act au
thorises the mortgagees of the company to enforce pay
ment of the arrears of principal and interest due to them
on their mortgages by the appointment of a receiver, then,
if within a certain specified time of the interest, or any
portion of the principal money accruing due, it be not paid,
application may be made to two justices for the appoint
ment of a receiver; to whom accordingly all the tolls due
to the company are to be paid until the liquidation of the
amount in arrear has been effected, when the power of the
receiver will cease (c).
The above are the summary remedies given to parties
(frequently in addition to others), for the recovery of debts
or of monies due from a railway company, whether in the
nature of rents, interest and principal on mortgages, tithe
rent charge, costs, damages, and expenses, or liquidated
penalties, when duly adjudged. We proceed now to notice
more particularly the mode of proceeding to be adopted
for enforcing the penal clauses of the Special and General
Railway Acts by summons, or information, and conviction
before justices, with the right of appeal given to parties in
such cases.
Summary con- II. Compliance with those numerous and minute pro
victions. visions of the General and Special Railway Acts, which
impose a variety of duties and obligations upon the com
pany, is usually enforced by penalties. Once adjudged,
these penalties are recoverable, like many other money
demands, by distress of the effects of the company. It
remains, however, to notice the mode in which such an

CHAP. III.] REMEDIES. 619
adjudication must be obtained. It is provided by the
Companies' Clauses Act (a), the Lands’ Clauses Act (b),
and the Railways’ Clauses Act (c), that every penalty or
forfeiture imposed by the General or Special Railway Acts,
or any Act incorporated therewith, or by any bye-law made
in pursuance thereof, the recovery of which is not other
wise provided for, may be recovered by summary proceed
ing before two justices; and on complaint being made to
any justice, he shall issue a summons, requiring the party
complained against to appear before two justices at a time
and place to be named in the summons; and on the ap
pearance of the party complained against, or, in his absence,
on proof of the due service of the summons, the justices
may proceed to hear the complaint, although no informa
tion in writing or in print shall have been exhibited be
fore them; and on proof of the offence, by confession, or
on the oath of one or more witnesses, the justices may
convict the party charged, and adjudge the offender to pay
the penalty or forfeiture incurred, and such costs attend
ing the conviction as they may think right. This enact
ment seems to include railway companies as well as private
individuals, and will comprehend nearly all the cases in
which penalties are imposed upon them for breaches of
the provisions of their Acts. Thus, they may be summarily
convicted for entering upon lands without the consent of
the owners before payment or deposit of the purchase
money (d); for failing to keep in their principal office, or
deposit with the clerks of the peace, copies of the Special
Act (e); for obstructing the supply of water or gas during
the execution of the works (f); for interfering with exist
ing roads before providing proper substituted roads (g);
for neglecting to restore old roads or complete substituted
roads within the prescribed period (h); for not repairing

roads used by them (a); for failing to make approaches
and fences where highways are crossed on the level (b);
for neglecting to construct screens for roads when required
by the Commissioners of Railways (c); for failing properly
to repair bridges, gates, and fences (d); for not depositing
a copy of their annual account with overseers and clerks of
the peace (e); for using engines not consuming their own
smoke (f). For any refusal on the part of a railway com
pany to convey the mails, or to execute or renew, when
required by the Postmaster-General, the bond to her
Majesty; the company may (at any time within a year next
after the offence) be summoned before any justice of the
peace having jurisdiction in any county through which the
railway passes; and on conviction thereof before such
single magistrate, the penalty may be adjudged against
them (g).
The several penalties imposed by the Companies’ Clauses,
Lands’ Clauses, and Railways’ Clauses Acts, for any offence
made cognisable before a justice, cannot be enforced
against any person or company unless the complaint shall
have been made to the justice within six months next after
the commission of the offence (h).
In all cases of summary conviction by justices as above
mentioned, the General Railway Acts give a right of appeal
to the quarter sessions; and in each of them it is
enacted (i), “That if any party shall feel aggrieved by
any determination or adjudication of any justice with re
spect to any penalty or forfeiture under the provisions of
this or the Special Act, or any Act incorporated there
with, such party may appeal to the general quarter sessions

have arisen; but no such appeal shall be entertained un
less it be made within four months next after the making
of such determination or adjudication; nor unless ten
days’ notice in writing of such appeal, stating the nature
and grounds thereof, be given to the party against whom
the appeal shall be brought; nor unless the appellant
forthwith after such notice enter into recognisances, with
two sufficient sureties, before a justice, conditioned duly
to prosecute such appeal, and to abide the order of the
Court thereon.” At the quarter sessions, for which such
notice shall be given, the Court shall proceed to hear and
determine the appeal in a summary way; or they may, if
they think fit, adjourn it to the following sessions; and upon
the hearing of such appeal, the Court may, if they think
fit, mitigate any penalty or forfeiture, or they may confirm
or quash the adjudication, and order any money paid by
the appellant, or levied by distress upon his goods, to be
returned to him; and may also order such further satis
faction to be made to the party injured as they may judge
reasonable; and they may make such order concerning
the costs both of the adjudication and the appeal as they
may think reasonable.” These provisions require no com
ment, with the exception of a single remark upon the sub
ject of the time within which the appeal must be made.
The words used in relation to this subject are, that the
appeal shall not be entertained “unless it be made within -
four months,” &c. Usually, therefore, the appeal must be
to the quarter sessions next succeeding the adjudication
complained of; but if that adjudication should take place
within ten days of the sessions, the appeal must necessa
rily be to the second sessions thereafter, in order to allow
time for the notice and grounds thereof to be delivered
to the other party. The appeal having been duly lodged
with the clerk of the peace, may be respited from the first
to a subsequent session; and might have been so respited,
although the Railway Acts had contained no such provision,

appeal is necessarily incident to the Court of quarter ses
sions as a Court of justice, and can only be over-ridden
by positive enactment (a). When called on to be heard,
it would seem that the appellants must first prove service
of their notice and grounds of appeal upon the respondents,
and the entry into recognizances, as required by the statutes
above cited; both of which are essential preliminaries to
their right to be heard. The conviction is then read by the
clerk of the peace, and the case is heard on technical ob
jections to the form of it; and, if they are over-ruled, then
upon the facts in the usual way. The form of the con
viction for any offence under the General or Special Rail
way Acts being prescribed in the schedules thereto, and
there being a provision that no proceeding under those
Acts shall be quashed or vacated for want of form, or be
removable into the superior Courts, an appeal can seldom
prove successful on any technical or formal point; and
having once been heard and determined, the decision of the
sessions thereon will be final and conclusive, the certiorari
being expressly taken away by the General Railway Acts(b).
Although if, from some mistake, they refuse to entertain
an appeal, a mandamus would be granted commanding
them to hear it (c); or, if the Court were improperly con
stituted, or there were malversation, so that justice is not
done, a writ of certiorari will be issued (d).
In addition to the usual legal and equitable remedies
given to parties aggrieved by the conduct of a railway
company, and to those summary modes of proceeding be
fore justices just alluded to, there are several cases in which
the injured parties, or certain public officers, are invested
with a right of interference with the proceedings of the

company without the formality of any legal process. Thus,
if they proceed to execute any of their works on the shore
of the sea below high-water mark, or across any bay, creek,
arm of the sea, or navigable river, without the previous
consent, or contrary to the instructions, of the Commis
missioners of Woods and Forests, and the Lords of the
Admiralty, the latter may “abate and remove the same,
and restore the site thereof to its former condition, at the
cost and charge of the company” (a). In like manner,
the Drainage Commissioners in Ireland are authorised,
under certain circumstances, to interfere and construct
works connected with the railway (b). So, on the refusal
of the company to construct them, two justices, having ju
risdiction, mayorder any person to construct the approaches
and fences required to be made where the highway is
crossed on the level by a railroad (c). So, private indi
viduals are sometimes allowed to interfere and execute
accommodation works to which they are entitled, as the
owners of lands adjoining the railway, where the company
have neglected or refused to construct them (d).
Before dismissing the subject of remedies against a rail
way company, it is right to notice (although not falling
strictly under the head of summary proceedings), the power
conferred on the Commissioners of Railways by the statute
7 & 8 Vic. c. 85 (e), which enacts, that whenever it shall
appear to them “that any of the provisions of the several
Acts of Parliament regulating any railway company, or the
provisions of this Act, or of any General Act relating to rail
ways, have not been complied with on the part of any railway
company, or any of its officers, or that any railway company
has acted, or is acting, in a manner unauthorised by the
provisions of the Act or Acts of Parliament relating to such
railway, or in excess of the powers given or objects defined
by the said Act or Acts; and it shall also appear to the

vantage that the company should be restrained from so
acting, the commissioners shall certify the same to her
Majesty’s Attorney-General for England or Ireland, or to
the Lord Advocate for Scotland, as the case may require;
and thereupon the said Attorney-General or Lord Advocate
shall, in case such default of the railway company shall
consist of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act
or Acts relating thereto, or of this Act, or of any General
Act relating to railways, proceed by information or by
action, bill, plaint, suit at law or in Equity, or other legal
proceeding, as the case may require, to recover such penal
ties and forfeitures, or otherwise to enforce the due per
formance of the said provisions, by such means as any
person aggrieved by such non-compliance, or otherwise
authorised to sue for such penalties, might employ under
the provisions of the said Acts; and in case the default of
the railway company shall consist in the commission of
some acts or acts unauthorised by law, then the said
Attorney-General or Lord Advocate, upon receiving such
certificate as aforesaid, shall proceed by suit in equity, or
such other legal proceeding as the nature of the case may
require, to obtain an injunction or order (which the judge
in equity, or other judge to whom the application is made,
shall be authorised and required to grant, if he shall be of
opinion that the act or acts of the railway company com
plained of is or are not authorised by law), to restrain the
company from acting in such illegal manner, or to give
such other relief as the nature of the case may require.”
Before the Commissioners of Railways can furnish the
certificate above mentioned, to authorise the instituting of
legal proceedings against a company, they must give
twenty-one days’ notice of their intention to the company
to be affected thereby; and no such proceedings can be
taken in pursuance of the certificate unless the latter shall
have been given within one year after the commission of
the offence complained of (a).

CHAPTER IV.
REMEDIES BY A RAILWAY COMPANY.
THE remedies available where the rights of an incorporated
railway company are infringed, are generally similar to
those which, under the like circumstances, belong to a pri
vate individual. In addition to these ordinary remedies,
however, many others are expressly given to such com
panies in the Special and General Railway Acts; and faci
lities as regards pleading and evidence are afforded them
in certain cases where the usual common-law and equitable
proceedings are adopted. We propose in this chapter to
allude briefly to the legal, equitable, criminal, and statutory
remedies of a railway company, as applicable both against
members or servants of the company itself, and against
strangers; noticing as we proceed only such points of law,
pleading, practice, and evidence, as have a special bearing
upon the subject of our work. We shall treat first of pro
ceedings in Equity and at Common Law; and then of cri
minal, summary, and other remedies, including those
specially given by the Statute of Incorporation, or other
W1Se.

by a suit. Thus, a railway company will be entitled to an
injunction under circumstances which would justify the
issuing of that writ at the instance of any private person.
Thus, where the surveyors of a highway, or any other per
sons, are interfering in an unwarrantable manner with
railway works, either by hindering the prosecution of them,
or obstructing them when made; as by removing the rails
from a part of the line, or erecting a fence across it, so as
to impede the passage of the company’s engines and car
riages, the Court will restrain them by injunction (a). So
a decree of specific performance may be obtained to enforce
the execution of a contract made with a railway company,
or with their agent duly authorised (b). Or the company
may file a bill to be relieved against any fraudulent, op
pressive, or unfair dealing, on the part of a third party.
In the same manner, common-law remedies are available
in the case of companies not less extensively than in the
case of individuals. Hence, a corporation may obtain a
writ of mandamus where, having a legal right, they have
no legal remedy for its enforcement (c). So they may re
move proceedings in which they are interested from an
inferior tribunal to the Court of Queen’s Bench by certio
rari, in cases where that right is not expressly taken away
by statute. The instances in which this writ has most
frequently issued on the application of a railway company,
are those where coroners’ inquests have been held, and
the company have been desirous of quashing the inqui
sitions for informality, want of jurisdiction, or other defects.
Since the abolition of deodands, however, on the occur
rence of fatal accidents on a railroad, this writ will in future

seldom be required for the purpose of removing these pro
ceedings; and in nearly all other cases the right to certio
rari is taken away by statute (a). All the forms of action,
both ex contractu and ex delicto, are maintainable by a
railway company, as occasions arise, for the recovery of
debts and damages; and they can also bring ejectment
against parties who have ousted them from lands in which
they have the legal interest, and also a right of possession
not barred by the Statute of limitations. Thus, they
may sue in assumpsit or debt upon contracts entered into
with them, and which it was within the scope of their
authority to make. So they can bring an action of cove
mant in case such contract should have been made under
seal. So, for any injuries to their property, or any wrong
ful act or omission whereby they are damnified, they may
have the like remedies as an individual similarly circum
stanced. Thus, they may bring an action of trespass
against a person for breaking their fences and crossing
their railway (b); or an action on the case for consequential
damage resulting from the defendants' conduct; or they
may maintain trover where the facts are such as would
support that action between private persons. In selecting
any of these forms of action as their appropriate remedy
in any given case, the company will be guided by the
ordinary rules of law, which will usually apply both to the
pleadings, the practice, and the evidence, in the same
manner and to the same extent as if the party suing were
an individual. There are, however, some instances in which
facilities are given to a railway company by statute as to
the construction of their pleadings, and the support of
their case by evidence, which demand a brief notice before
dismissing this part of our subject. The instance of most
frequent recurrence and of chief importance is that of an
action of debt brought by the company against one of the

proprietors to recover arrears of calls. Here the right and
the remedy are both created by the Statutes of Incor
poration, which constitute the calls when properly made
a debt to the company, recoverable in a particular manner.
Hence, the precise remedy pointed out must be adopted
for their recovery, and the prescribed course must be ex
actly followed (a). Therefore, if the right to sue be limited
to a particular jurisdiction, the action could not be main
tained if it were brought out of that jurisdiction (b).
In an action for calls, the Companies’ Clauses Act pre
scribes a form of declaration, not setting forth the special
matter, but simply averring that the defendant is the
holder of certain shares in the company, and is indebted
to the company in the sum of money to which the calls
amount, whereby an action hath accrued to the company
by virtue of that and the Special Act (c). At Common
Law, such a declaration discloses no right of action; but,
as interpreted by the enactments of the statute, it must be
taken to include a statement of all that is required to be
proved in order to give the plaintiffs a right to sue. If,
therefore, a company declare for calls under the Act, the
form should be strictly pursued; yet where the declaration
alleged that the defendant, before the commencement of
the suit, had been a proprietor of shares in the company,
and was and still is indebted to the company for a call
upon those shares, it was held good on general demurrer,
though not literally in conformity with the Act (d).
The concise form of declaration above given furnishes
great facilities to the company, by simplifying and narrow
ing the statement of their cause of action, and precluding
technical objections; but for the purposes of pleading, and

to enable the defendant to frame his answer correctly, the
declaration must be referred to the section of the statute
under which it is drawn (which must substantially be
deemed a pat of it), so that it must be considered as im
pliedly containing those averments which the Act says
must be proved (a); and therefore (in addition to the state
ment of the defendants’ proprietorship), as virtually alleging
the making of the call and the giving of the prescribed
notice.
It is specially provided (b), that, on the trial of an action
for a call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the defendant,
at the time of making the call, was a holder of one or
more shares in the undertaking; that the call was in fact
made, and notice thereof given, as required by the Special
or General Railway Acts; and that it shall not be neces
sary to prove the appointment of the directors who made
the call, nor any other matter whatsoever. And as these
several facts are (as we have seen) to be considered as
included in the declaration, pleas in denial of them should
conclude to the contrary, and not with a verification (c).
It would seem, however, that each of these pleas is unne
cessary (d) and objectionable, as amounting to the plea of
nunquam indebitatus; inasmuch as the company can only
recover on proof of these several facts, which therefore are
all virtually denied in the general issue, and need not be spe
cifically traversed (e). To enable the company to recover,
therefore, the three facts to be proved are the proprietor
ship of the defendant, the making of the call, and the

giving of the notice. The first point is usually established
by production of the register of shareholders, which is made,
when authenticated by the company’s seal (a), primá facie
evidence of the party entitled to shares, and of their number
and amount (b). Some irregularities in the mode of keep
ing this document will not render it inadmissible in evi
dence against a defendant, unless inaccuracies can be shown
to exist in the entry regarding himself (c). If the corporate
seal has not been affixed to the register since the insertion
of the defendants’ name, or is inadmissible on other
grounds, his liability may be shown, if he be an original
subscriber, by proof of his having executed the subscription
contract; or of his having acted as a proprietor by payment
of the deposit and former calls, attending at meetings, and
the like; or if he claim under a transfer, the transfer-deed
(which is to be lodged with the secretary of the com
pany(d)), may be produced; and this will be sufficient to
establish the fact of proprietorship, although no memorial
thereof shall have been entered in the register of transfers,
the latter being rather for the protection of the com
pany (e).
The making of the call may be proved by production of
the minute-book of the directors, duly signed by the chair
man of the meeting at which it was made (f). As to what
is a sufficient signing of these minutes, the reader is re
ferred to a former part of this work (g). If, on production
of the book, it purports to be signed by the chairman of
the meeting, it will be taken to be so signed; and the due

bled, and other points of the like nature, will be presumed
until the contrary be proved (a). The notice of the call
may be proved, as other notices, in the usual way. Having
succeeded in proving the defendants’ proprietorship, the
making of the call, and the statutory notice, the company
will be entitled to recover the amount due for the call,
together with interest (for which it is not necessary to
declare), unless it shall appear that the call exceeds the
prescribed amount, that due notice of it was not given, or
that the prescribed interval between two successive calls
had not elapsed, or that calls amounting to more than the
prescribed sum had been made within a year. Hence,
these several defences may be put on the record by the
defendant; or, admitting the existence of the facts neces
sary to support the declaration, he may avoid their effect
by something subsequent; as payment, release, or a for
feiture of his shares by the directors, duly confirmed at a
general meeting of the company. This latter defence
must, however, be correctly set forth in the plea; and
must state all the circumstances necessary to show that a
forfeiture has actually taken place (b).
A defendant, however, will not be allowed to plead mat
ters which are in contravention both of the terms and spirit
of the General Railway Acts. Thus, pleas that the calls
were made for other than the purposes of the Act; that
deviations from the original line had been made, not war
ranted by the Act; and that the calls were made for the
purpose of those deviations; and that, at the time of the
making of the calls, there were not the required number
of shares in the company; were severally disallowed, as
raising issues not contemplated by the statute—calculated
to throw so many difficulties in the way of raising the capital
of the company as would utterly defeat the objects of it,

and as opening questions not fit to be decided in a Court
of Law, however suitable for discussion at the general
meetings of the company, the tribunal especially appointed
for their consideration and decision (a). In a similar case,
where it was proposed to plead, first, that there were not
a competent number of directors present when the calls
were made; secondly, that no notice of the calls; thirdly,
or of the time, or place, or person for payment thereof,
was given; fourthly, that the calls were not made for the
expenses of the undertaking, and not necessary for the
purposes of the Act; fifthly, that they were not made upon
all the subscribers and proprietors; sixthly, that they were
not made by competent persons, and for the sole purpose
of the undertaking; the pleas were disallowed as contrary
to the provisions of the Act of Parliament under which the
action was brought; and the defendant was confined to the
pleas of nunquam indebitatus; that he was not a proprietor;
and that the directors had exercised their option in de
claring the shares to be forfeited, and had taken the steps
thereon directed by the Act (b). A plea that, before the
call was made, the defendant transferred his shares, and
that the transfer was duly deposited with the secretary of
the company, and a memorial thereof entered as required
by the statute, is unnecessary and bad, as amounting to
the general issue, and showing that the defendant was
never indebted (c).
As we have already seen, defendants in actions for
calls are precluded from raising questions by their pleas
touching the general constitution, objects, and manage
ment of the company, so they cannot apply to the Court
on motion requiring the Court to decide upon these points;
inasmuch as it is hardly to be supposed that, when the

Legislature precluded them from raising these questions
before a jury, or upon the record, it could have intended that
the Court should dispose of them in a summary way (a).
On account of the great importance of the subject, we
have entered into the above details of the proceedings when
a company are suing for calls; but it would be beyond
the scope of this work to go more minutely into the ques
tions of pleading and evidence in actions by railway com
panies. The above cases and observations will draw atten
tion to the principal points which have been raised and
decided in relation to these subjects; and for further in
formation, the reader is referred to the many valuable
works which treat of the law of pleading and evidence (b).
Sec. II.—Criminal and Statutory Remedies by a Railway
Company.
AN incorporated companycan prosecute by indictment like
an ordinary person, either for felony or misdemeanor. They
must, however, prosecute in their corporate name; and the
addition of such name, as a description of the persons of
whom the corporation is composed, is not sufficient in an
indictment (c). Therefore, if a railway company indict a
man for the stealing of their goods, the property must be
laid in the company, and not in the names of A. B. and
others, members of the corporation. For where any de
scription of men are directed by law to act in a corporate
capacity, their natural and individual capacity, as to all
matters relating to the subject of their incorporation, is
totally extinct. Indeed, it is obvious that the law cannot

regard the individuals of whom a corporation is composed,
but only the creature of the corporation, which is imper
sonal; it being an accident only, and not essential to its
existence, that certain persons are for the time being mem
bers of the body. Nor can the property of an incorporated
company be considered, in any strict or legal sense, to be
long to individuals; not even to all the members jointly,
but to the abstraction which the statute has created and
the law recognises as a corporation. In all legal proceed
ings, therefore, civil as well as criminal, the incorporated
body must act and be dealt with in its corporate character.
So it must sue and be sued, so it must indict and be in
dicted, so it must be restrained by injunction, so it must
be compelled by mandamus (a). Therefore, if an action
were brought in the private names of the plaintiffs for any
matter or on any contract relating to their public capa
city, they must unavoidably be non-suited; and, a fortiori,
it must be erroneous in a criminal prosecution. In order
to sustain an indictment for a larceny of the property of a
railway company, a copy of the Special Act must be put in
evidence, to prove their incorporation; yet it need not, in
general, be a copy examined and compared with the parlia
mentary roll, as in the case of an ordinary private Act, but
a copy purporting to be printed by the Queen’s printer,
will be sufficient for that purpose; Railway Acts usually
containing a clause to the effect that they are to be
deemed and taken to be public Acts, and to be judicially
noticed as such (b). The trial, the verdict, and the judg
ment, on an indictment, at the instance and on the pro
secution of a railway company, or other corporation, differ
not at all from ordinary cases, and require, consequently,
no further comment or explanation.
We proceed, therefore, to notice briefly the peculiar
remedies (chiefly by summary proceedings before magis

trates), conferred on railway companies by the General
and Special Acts, for the protection of their own and
the public interests. In doing so, we shall treat of
these proceedings, first, as they are applicable to cases in
which the public safety is concerned; and, secondly, as
they are adapted to enforce the rights, or protect the pro
perty, or interests of the company itself.
I. The power of a railway company over the persons in
their own employment, or in the c. ployment of other
companies or persons, but occupied upon the railway, is
very great in all cases in which the public safety is con
cerned. Thus, by a General Act for the regulation of
railways (a), provision is made for the punishment of ser
vants of railway companies guilty of misconduct; and the
company are empowered, by any officer or agent in their
employment, or by any special constable duly appointed,
or by any persons called to their assistance, “to seize and
detain any engine-driver, waggon-driver, guard, porter, ser
vant, or other person employed by the said or by any other
railway company, or by any other company or person, in
conducting traffic upon the railway belonging to the said
company, or in repairing and maintaining the works of the
said railway, who shall be found drunk while so employed,
who shall commit any offence against any of the bye-laws,
rules, or regulations of the said company, or who shall
wilfully, maliciously, or negligently do or omit to do any
act whereby the life or limb of any person passing along,
or being upon such railway or the works thereof respec
tively, shall be or might be injured or endangered, or
whereby the passage of any engines, carriages, or trains,
shall be or might be obstructed or impeded; and to con
vey such engine-driver, guard, porter, servant, or other
person so offending, or any person counselling, aiding, or
assisting in such offence, with all convenient dispatch be
fore some justice of the peace,” without warrant; and the

person so apprehended may, upon conviction of the offence
be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for any term
not exceeding two calendar months, or be fined any sum
not exceeding £10, and in default of payment be impri
soned as before mentioned. The justice before whom a
party is charged with any of the above offences may, if he
think fit, instead of disposing of the matter summarily,
commit the accused for trial at the quarter sessions; in
the meanwhile ordering him to be imprisoned or admitting
him to bail in his discretion. On conviction at the sessions,
the offender will be liable to two years’ imprisonment, with:
or without hard labour (a).
Persons guilty of wilfully obstructing any engine or
carriage on a railway, so as to endanger the safety of per
sons in or on the same, are liable, on conviction, to impri
sonment for any term not exceeding two years (b); but no
summary remedy is given to the company in such case.
But where any person wilfully impedes any officer or agent
of a railway company in the execution of his duty upon any
railway, or upon or in any of the stations, or other works
or premises connected therewith, or wilfully trespasses upon
the same, and refuses to quit on request, he may be de
tained by the company’s officers or agents until he can be
conveniently taken before a justice; and then, on convic
tion, will be liable to forfeit the sum of £5, or to be im
prisoned for two months on default of payment (c).
We have already seen (d), that a railway company are
authorised to enact bye-laws (e) for the regulation of the
conduct of their officers and servants, and for the manage
ment of the business and affairs of the company; and to
enforce them by reasonable penalties, to be recovered sum
marily before two justices of the peace(f), and levied by
distress of the offender's goods; or, if they be insufficient
for the purpose, then he may be imprisoned for three

months. Any person transgressing these regulations may,
if his name and residence be unknown, be detained (a);
but the company have no right to detain him for the breach
of some bye-law made only for the protection of the com
pany, and in which the interest and safety of the public is
in no way concerned (b). If the infraction or non-ob
servance of any bye-law or other such regulation be at
tended with danger or annoyance to the public, or hin
drance to the company in the lawful use of the railway,
the company may interfere summarily to obviate or remove
such danger, annoyance, or hindrance, without prejudice
to any penalty incurred by reason of the offence com
plained of(c). In all cases of summary conviction before
justices, any party aggrieved by their decision may appeal
to the Court of quarter sessions, whose judgment will be
final (d).
Any person omitting to shut and fasten any gate set up
at either side of the railway for the accommodation of the
occupiers of the adjoining lands, as soon as he, and the
carriage or cattle, &c., shall have passed, is liable to a
penalty of 40s, to be recovered summarily as above men
tioned (e); and as such negligence greatly endangers the
safety of the travellers on the railway, and is a breach of
the Act of Parliament itself, the offender may no doubt
be detained, if he refuse to give his name and residence.
So, where mines are worked in the neighbourhood of a
railway, the company are authorised and empowered to
enter upon and inspect them, and to order the construction
of such works as may be necessary to secure the stability
of the line, and protect the public using it from accident (f).
On the refusal of the owners of the mines to do what is
enjoined, the company may themselves execute the works,

and recover the expense from the parties liable (a). For
any refusal to permit entry and inspection of mines, the
parties refusing are liable to a penalty of £20 a day, re
coverable summarily (b).
On the same principle, and for the protection of the
public, penalties are imposed on parties bringing dangerous,
inflammable, or explosive goods on the railway, without
giving notice thereof(c); and the company may open and
inspect, and refuse to carry any parcel suspected of con
taining such articles. So, for bringing or using on the
line any improper engine or carriage, or refusing to remove
it on request by the company, a penalty may be reco
vered (d), and the company are empowered to remove it.
So, if any carriage be improperly loaded, so as to be liable
to collision with other carriages; or be left on the line so
as to obstruct the passage of the trains, the company may
unload or remove it; and will not be liable for any damage
resulting from such unloading or removal (e).
II. In all the instances above cited, the summary remedy,
either by proceedings before justices, or by actual inter
ference to abate or remove the cause of mischief or danger,
or by the execution of works required to ensure the sta
bility of the railway, is given to the company for the sake
of the public, and to prevent danger and accident to the
persons using the line. But there are other cases in which
regulations, having been made to protect the property and
interests, and facilitate the business of the company, their
due observance is enforced by penalties recoverable as
above, or their infraction remedied by other summary
proceedings. Thus, where a railway company have en
titled themselves, by a rigid compliance with statutory for
malities, to enter upon and take possession of any lands,
and the occupier refuses to give them up, they may issue
their warrant to their sheriff to deliver possession thereof to

(e) Id. ss. 122, 123.
CHAP. Iv.] REMEDIES, 639
the party named in the warrant, and they then enter on
the land under this summary process without the delay
and expense attending an action of ejectment (a). So,
where any person wilfully obstructs the company’s servants
in the lawful exercise of their power in setting out the
line of railway, or pulls up or removes any stakes set up,
or defaces any marks made for that purpose, he will be
liable to a penalty of £5(b). So, where any party defaces
or destroys any milestones or marks on the side of the
railway (c). So, if any trespass or damages be committed
upon the company’s premises, or to their property, by the
engines or carriages of other parties, the amount of the
damage, if not exceeding £50, may be recovered in a sum
mary manner before two justices (d).
In a similar manner, the company's right to tolls is
protected by remedies of the same character, and enforced
by the like process. Thus, if the owner or party having
the care of goods liable to toll refuse to give an account
of their number, weight, or character, to the company’s
collector, for the purpose of ascertaining the charge to be
made for their carriage, the party refusing is liable to a
penalty (e). So, a refusal to pay tolls that are due may
be remedied by the detention and sale of the carriages and
goods liable thereto; or, if they have been removed from
the railway, then by the sale of any other carriages and
goods belonging to the debtor (f). So passengers prac
tising frauds on the company in relation to fares, are liable
to a penalty of £2, and may be detained until they can be
taken before a justice, or be otherwise discharged by due
course of law (g).
Before concluding, it is right to mention that the com
pany have very stringent and effective remedies against

their own clerks, agents, toll-collectors, and others in their
service and employment. Thus, it is provided by the Com
panies’ Clauses Act (a), that any officer employed by the
company refusing, when properly requested, to render an
account and deliver up all vouchers and receipts in his
possession, and to pay the balance due from him, and to
hand over all papers, writings, property, and effects be
longing to the company, may be summoned before two
justices, who may order the money due to be paid by the
defaulter, or to be levied by distress of his goods; or, in
default of payment, may commit him to gaol for three
months. If he refuse to make out and deliver his accounts,
or to give up papers and documents, he may be imprisoned
until he comply with the order of the justices to that effect.
Or, if it be made to appear to a justice, on the oath of
some person on behalf of the company, that the default
ing officer contemplates absconding, a warrant for his ap
prehension may be issued instead of a summons; but he
must not be detained longer than twenty-four hours under
such warrant without being brought before some justice,
who may either discharge him or commit him (in default
of satisfactory bail), until he can be brought before two
justices who have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the com
plaint against him.
So, if any toll-collector or other officer in the company’s
service die, or be discharged or suspended from his office,
or abscond or absent himself, and he, or his wife, widow,
family, or representatives, refuse or neglect, after seven
days’ notice in writing, to deliver up to the company any
station, dwelling-house, office, or other building, with its
appurtenances, or any books, papers, or other matters be
longing to the company, in the possession or custody of
any such collector or officer at the occurrence of any such
event as aforesaid, then, on application to a justice, he may

and terminating in, at, or near to, in the county of . (If
any branches are proposed, here state them) [together with a branch railway,
commencing at, &c., and terminating at, &c.,] would not only be of great advan
tage to your petitioners, and the other inhabitants of the said counties, cities,
towns, and places, but would tend to the improvement of the trading and
manufacturing interests in the said districts, by affording the means of a safe,
cheap, and speedy conveyance for passengers, goods, and merchandise, which
your petitioners humbly conceive would be of great public utility.
That your petitioners are willing, if authorised by Parliament, to undertake
the execution and construction of the said railway [and branches].
That for attaining these objects, your petitioners have caused to be prepared
a bill, a printed copy of which is hereunto annexed. Your petitioners, there
fore, humbly pray your Honourable House that leave may be given them to

The humble memorial of the undersigned owners and occupiers of land
upon the line of the proposed railway, and others,
Sheweth,
That a petition has been deposited in the Private Bill Office of the Honour
able the House of Commons, for leave to introduce a bill with the short title
above mentioned. -
That your memorialists are affected by the said bill as owners and occupiers
of lands upon the line of the intended railway, or within the limits of deviation
described upon the plans, or otherwise.
(a) See pages 102–104 supra. (b) See page 117, supra.
710 APPENDIX,
That the standing orders of the House of Commons have not been com
plied with in relation to the said bill in the following particulars.
[Here state the instances of non-compliance according to the facts; as that the
notices in the “Gazette” did not specify the intention of the company in the
same manner as the bill; that notices were not delivered to the proper parties
at the proper times and places; that the subscription contract is invalid
(assigning the reasons) and the like.]
[The following objections are given at length for the purpose of showing the
form in which parties may take advantage of defects in the plans, sec
tions, and books of reference.]
That the plans are defective, inasmuch as a house and garden adjoining
No. in the parish of , within the limits of deviation marked
upon the plan, is not numbered upon the said plan, nor is the same, nor the
owner, lessee, or occupier thereof, mentioned in the book of reference.
That similar objections apply to and in the parishes
of •
That the plans being upon a scale of four inches to the mile, there is no
additional plan, on a scale of not less than one quarter of an inch to every one
hundred feet, of a garden in the parish of within the limits of devi
ation marked upon the said plan adjoining the properties numbered thereon
and in the said parish.
That the sections ofthe proposed railways deposited in the Private Bill Office,
are inaccurate and defective in the following, amongst other particulars.
That on sheet of the section of the intended railway, the line
drawn thereon to correspond with the upper surface of the rail is at the
point miles, furlongs, nearer the datum line by
feet, or thereabouts, than the line upon sheet No. at the same
distance upon the said section.
That the vertical height from the datum line to the several roads men
tioned in the annexed schedule, as appearing by calculation from the figured
heights and inclinations marked upon the said sections, differs from the vertical
height of the said several roads above the datum line, as measured by the
vertical scales attached to the said sections, in the instances and to the extent
shown in the following schedule;—

That the said section does not show correctly the surface of the ground
marked upon the plan, nor the true level thereof, with reference to the datum
horizontal line described upon the section, in the cases of the roads occurring
at the distances set forth in the following schedule; inasmuch as the height of
the surface of the said roads above the said datum line, as calculated from the
figured heights and inclinations upon the said section, appears to be as stated
in the second column of the annexed schedule, whereas the true height thereof
above the said datum line, is as appears by the figures stated in the third

That, although it appears by the said plans that it is the intention of the
petitioners for the said bill to take power to construct the works to be
authorised thereby, or some part thereof, in the parish of , the notice
of intention published in the Gazette, and in the newspaper, does
not contain the name of the said parish, nor was any deposit of so much of
the said plans and books of reference as relates to such parish, made with the
clerk of the said parish on or before the 30th day of November last.
Your memorialists therefore request, that they may be heard by themselves,
their agents, and witnesses, before the Examiner, to whom the said petition
may be referred, in support of the allegations above written, and that the
Examiner may certify upon such petition, that the standing orders have
not been complied with, and may report to the House of Commons ac
