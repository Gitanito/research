you
my name is Donna hare I
the 70s and 71 I worked in the building
eight of NASA for a contractor Philco
fort they&#39;ve changed their name several
times and over the years I worked in the
photo lab I worked in different areas of
the company on and off site during the
70&#39;s I don&#39;t know the exact date but I
walked into the photo lab one of the
restricted areas I do have a seat I did
have a secret clearance which I was not
aware at the time there were clearances
higher than I had because those
clearances are supposed to be kept
secret that you have them so I didn&#39;t
know I thought I had the top clearance I
walked into a restricted area which was
not my company it was the NASA photo lab
and there they they put they developed
the film from the moon and satellite
pictures everything that&#39;s done by NASA
there was no technology we were creating
it as we went along this day that
particular day I walked into the photo
lab in the restricted area and this was
between missions one of the gentlemen I
had been friends with and I still talked
to occasionally he pointed his my
attention to one area of this mosaic it
was one panel of a mosaic which are
several several panels put together to
form a larger picture and these were
either I believe they were satellite
pictures I&#39;m not sure there were aerial
looking down and I said this is really
interesting he explained everything and
then he and with a smile on his face he
said look over there and I looked and in
one of the photo panels
I saw a round white dot and at the time
it was very crisp very sharp lines on it
and I said to him what what is that is
that a dot on the emulsion and then he&#39;s
grinning and he says dots on the
emulsion don&#39;t leave Brown shadows on
the ground and there was a round shadow
at the right angle at the correct angle
the sun shining on the trees I saw pine
trees I didn&#39;t see a coastline I don&#39;t
know where this was but I looked at him
and I was pretty startled because I&#39;d
worked out there several years and never
seen anything like this never heard of
anything like this and I said is this a
UFO and he&#39;s smiling at me and he says I
can&#39;t tell you that I can&#39;t tell you
that what I knew he meant was it was but
he couldn&#39;t tell me so I said what are
you going to do with this information
and he said well we always have to
airbrush them out before we sell them to
the public
and I was just amazed that they had a
protocol in place for getting rid of UFO
pictures so as a precaution they were
put in quarantine for a little while
this particular man was in quarantine
with them and was part of their
debriefing he said that a lot of them
talked about their experience in seeing
these craft follow them I believe there
was three on the moon when they
landed and and I think that the inning
and this is the best of my memory that
the codeword was Santa Claus for these
crafts and then some that wanted to talk
were threatened if they talk they&#39;ve
signed papers not to talk they have
their retirements taken away I was just
overwhelmed with that piece of
information because I started asking
questions certain people that I would
know were key people in the organization
I take him away from the site we&#39;d go to
lunch and I&#39;d talk to him and alone they
would tell me things and then swear if I
ever said they said it they would say I
was lying one gentleman that I knew very
well was in quarantine with some of the
astronauts
he said just about every one of them has
seen things when they went to the moon
that were in fact one said that they
were there crafts were on the moon at
that time and this man has disappeared
off the face of the earth I&#39;ve tried to
find him but I have his name I&#39;ve given
to dr. Greer I&#39;m sure he can find him
but a lot of the astronauts are told to
keep it quiet and they&#39;re good Americans
too I mean it comes under the guise of
national security that&#39;s just something
that I feel over the years has been kept
quiet and how it&#39;s been kept quiet I
don&#39;t know I had no idea
I asked guards security guards I ran
into another security guard that was
forced to burn a lot of UFO pictures and
he told me he came into my office one
day this was when I worked at another
job he came into my office and he was
very frightened and he said Donna I&#39;m
you know I heard you were interested in
this subject he said I used to work out
there and one day some soldiers came in
in the fatigues and had me burned
pictures and he said that he was burning
them and they were he was forced not to
look at them but he was tempted he
looked at one of them and it was a UFO
on the ground shortly thereafter he was
hit in the head with a bun gun but and
he still had a scar on his forehead from
that being knocked out because he looked
at the picture now this gentleman was
terrified he was scared out of his mind
and he also said that in the picture was
a UFO with little bumps on it it looked
like he had just landed it&#39;s very hard
to to know this but again I have talked
the people that know about it know about
it and it&#39;s like a little underground
they&#39;ll come to me and talk to me in
private and they&#39;re afraid most of them
are very afraid and I guess I&#39;m I&#39;m not
afraid because I wasn&#39;t debriefed there
was a point in time I had some people
come out and tell me I shouldn&#39;t talk
about this
they didn&#39;t threaten to kill me but I
got the message I shouldn&#39;t talk about
it but I&#39;d already talked about it so
much it didn&#39;t really matter anymore to
friends and and people either know it or
they don&#39;t know it or they&#39;re they&#39;re
not sure and like I said in the
congressional informal congressional
hearing it I really started feeling like
this topic was about like sex
you know everybody knew about it and
nobody talked about it mixed company and
that it you knew about it you would you
would have like a friend he was so
terrified he looked at me so frightened
like I&#39;m going to tell her and I
wouldn&#39;t because you know she he hasn&#39;t
told her it would probably put him in
jeopardy at this time and I&#39;m waiting
for that to come public whenever there&#39;s
a congressional hearing where he&#39;d be
protected and he may he would be one of
the ones that would probably not come
willingly because he&#39;s very frightened
he was so scared that I was going to say
something
and I had not I don&#39;t want to hurt
anyone and I trust dr. Greer I feel he&#39;s
done everything he said he would do as
far as protection secrecy of what I give
him for now I want it to come out when
it&#39;s necessary and proper and it can do
something I don&#39;t want people that are
trying to go around cleaning up their
mess and getting rid of these people or
hurting them or challenging them or or
making them so frightened they move away
like this one particular man I know well
that has just disappeared off the face
of the earth is disappeared I just don&#39;t
want that you know I don&#39;t want them to
you know a lot of people have asked me
well what Senators were at this
congressional hearing what which
witnesses do you know and what are names
and I don&#39;t give that out in public
Greer has them locked up some of our it
was very critical that we do this
perfectly we had also simulations before
the mission that would generate what
they expected the craft to do the lights
would on the 10 by 20 foot screen in the
control center they would have these
projected up there and a light would go
off going the pathway of the difference
this is really one continual line but
it&#39;s done on different scales that we
had to do the light would continue on
and if the light varied which
represented real-time information coming
back from the spacecraft one of the
things that I&#39;m upset about is that good
people are forced to do illegal things
and I believe that this information
should be given to the American public
that&#39;s just something that I feel over
the years has been kept quiet walked
over to one side of the lab and he said
by the way we&#39;ve discovered a base on
the backside of the moon and I said I
said who&#39;s Wayne he knows he said yes
there&#39;s we&#39;ve discovered a base on the
backside of the Moon and at that point I
be cut became frightened and it was a
little terrified thinking to myself that
if anybody walks in the room now I know
we&#39;re in jeopardy
