  		              		Experience Description   

    I was a movie/theater decorator and scenographer. I was in two-year  relationship  with Paul who had been diagnosed by a psychiatrist as a narcissistic pervert. This relationship was completely destroying me. I was harassed, assaulted, and 15 days before my suicide he tried to choke me to death. 
  
  Although I was the mother of a teenage girl, I was so  totally wrecked  that I planned to suicide. My plans were  on a day when my daughter was not expected to be with me.
  
  When the day arrived, I was drinking a lot to find enough courage to abandon my daughter. Then I took a lot of  pills. I lost consciousness when my daughter came home.  I remember seeing her entering the house.
  
  The memory of my experience is very short, but very precise and vivid. I didn't pass through a tunnel, as I know many persons have.
  
  Instead, I found myself in a place where there was no space nor time. This place  was brilliant gray and an intense light was in front of me. The light was far away, as I didn't see it as very big.  I sensed that I had no body and was one with the environment. The environment contained information, and in a certain way, I was part of that information.
  
  Facing me, there were three Beings sitting side by side  at a big table. They were benevolent Beings, but I felt that they were firm. They seemed to be studying books and documents.
  
  One of them looked at me and addressed me. I didn't really hear it talking, but nevertheless the message was clear and the information was direct, 'You have nothing to do here. We signed a contract and you must go back.'

  I went back, knowing that it spoke the truth.

  While coming down to my body, I saw myself in the small emergency room. I noticed the IV and my body  lying on a stretcher. I also saw three  nurses in a side room, talking quietly around a small table with coffee on it. I saw my daughter and my girlfriend, who were  waiting anxiously in the room. I was rather concerned having to return to my body, which seemed small and narrow to me.

  I woke up to be  forcibly confined by a third party. After running away from hospital, I was found and beaten by the male nurses at the psychiatric hospital.  Then they locked me up in a rubber room for maybe 24 or 48 hours. I don't know for sure how much time I was in there.

  I got out after 10 to 12 days thanks to a 'agreement' with my psychiatrist, and my promise to her not to start all over. 

  It was after this that my new life started.  I started to see visions and have strong sensations, feelings about others and their past and future life. I could reading thoughts and receive messages.  I read and learned how to help myself.   Many of of my intuitions come true and my life fell into  sync.   I can talk to plants and whatever matter. Myguides are sending me information and music, and even jokes!!  For seven years,  I have been  a psycho-energetics specialist. I'm clear-sentient with my senses developing more each day.  

  Of course, I absolutely have no fear of death. The immeasurable love that I felt on the other side of the veil  came back with me and comforts me every day, even if I know that it's not possible to encounter it in the three-dimensional plane.    					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 31-05-2009  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Suicide attempt       Life threatening event, but not clinical death   Suicide attempt with drinking alcohol and eating drugs.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  While coming back down to earth I saw my body lying on a stretcher in a small emergency room of  the hospital. I saw 3 nurses talking quietly around a small table in the side room, while taking a coffee. I saw my daughter and my girlfriend in the waiting room, waiting anxiously.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   I knew where I was, I was one with the environment.  The problem is that, being forcibly drugged during the 15 days following my return, I forgot the main part of the conversation with the guides.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         At the moment when I was with the 3 guides. Everything was consciousness at that moment, even myself.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     It was a place without space nor time. It was a whole 'now'.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       It was not the 5 physical senses being more or less something, but it was a global consciousness.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I had no ears, communication was instantly.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I don't think so, but I don't remember. However, I found this sensation I experienced afterwards, during meditations.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   An extremely luminous point but far away.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place     I was in a kind of anteroom. A place without space-time, where everything seemed to be tangible information. It was gray, very brilliant, thick, I perceived everything at 360 degrees, but there was not really something visible, more as if everything was me, or if I was everything.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I knew that the guides were right, but I didn't want to return to my body.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  I had no choice. It was clearly precised to me that I had nothing to do there and that I had a contract.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Secular unaffiliated   Unbeliever without refusal.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     You can call this 'beliefs or religious practices', but they aren't, they are beliefs or spiritual practices. Skeptics call it beliefs; I'm calling it practices.  Today I'm praying (one could rather say that I'm concentrating on a vibration of love while emitting wishes) whereas before I didn't do that.  
  
What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Faith into a divine, immeasurable but indescribable energy.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I was a world away to imagine, that the organization at the other side of the veil had a real similarity with the organization of the incarnated world. I have to say with much more wisdom and love in the subtle worlds.   On earth we are children on the course of education! A bit like on a playing board. Like the robots that we are creating now, that are educating themselves with artificial intelligence.  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I understood the meaning of life, how it organizes itself, how it creates itself, the powers that are opposing.  I understood also that it is important not to know everything, but that you have to do the task to what you destined yourself, with love. As life is millions and millions of times greater than the universe, and it's a labyrinth in which you can quickly get lost!  Myself having been completely merged with my daily chit chat (yet I was a professional 'artist'), I realized that to communicate was something much bigger than what we are saying about on earth. I understood so many things!!! It's difficult to say it here.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   I met 3 guides with whom I had a conversation. They told me very clearly that I had nothing to do there and that we had a contract.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I discovered that I had made a contract before incarnating in this lifetime, and that I was bound to return into my body in order to fulfill it.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Yes, we are all connected and actors of a great scene, heroes of our own story, and extra for the stories of others. We all play a part. Some of us know each other since a long time.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I knew that the three guides that I met were not unique, that they were part of a greater family of which I was also a part of.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   We have to learn to love. And to accomplish this love in the incarnated dimension.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Our goal is very clearly to learn to love, to feel love with our 5 senses, with our heart. Our goal is to follow and help with the evolution of planets and their inhabitants, to 'incarnate' the immeasurable immaterial love in educating particles, atoms, cells, the body and everything which exists. Our goal is to learn to accomplish physically what exists only in consciousness.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     While I was clearly without a body, I was clearly a consciousness having experienced things before incarnating in this body. I was totally 'present' yet knowing being out of my body.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Uncertain     I don't know any more if I learned during the experience. As I had been drugged a long time when coming back, I started to forget a great part, then subsequently I got messages in bits and pieces and revelations, as I came back with a very strongly increased sensitivity.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     It's the only and unique thing that we have to learn and exchange on earth.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     It's like a new chance I was given, as if I had been boosted. As if a memory had been activated, that I now have the comprehension of the meaning of life.  My five senses increased tenfold. I'm extra-sensitive and am receiving regularly information. I can tend to people and bring them Happiness. I feel problems of people, their disease, I can talk to deceased beings if it is useful for somebody. I perceive auras and the light of plants and beings. And a thousand things of this kind that are completely unspeakable about, in which the majority of people are not believing.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes This helped me to put terrestrial events into perspective, and relationships between people. It allowed me to understand what emotions are for.  Not that I give more or less importance to events, to suffering or Happiness, but I better understand the paths of everybody in their entirety.   For instance, I think that your work is of extreme utility, and that it is important for me to take part in it, at my scale.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I was in a kind of anteroom, a non-space-time room for self-examination.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  What I'm telling about my experience, I never would forget in my life. The part that I forgot, is since given to me in bits and pieces, but I still do not remember all of it.  Yet, after that experience, I gained a totally different view about incarnated life, something much grander, multidimensional.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Clair-sentience. I feel emotions, diseases, I see auras, Chakras, I sense past and future bits and pieces of people. I see and talk to deceased beings. I see and hear the guides and information. I can see organs in the body. My visions are still developing with time.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          At the moment when I understood that we are but one and the same consciousness.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    2 or 3 months. I talked about to my psychiatrist. She understood me and directed me towards competent persons in this field.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I was in a profound state of shock and didn't understand anything of what happened to me. I had disorganized visions and believed that I was going crazy.
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     My experience was absolutely real. There are all kinds of realities. Here you cannot yet 'judge', as we still don't know anything, or very little, of everything that exists in the more subtle dimensions.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   The contacts with the guides reproduced. I returned to places without space nor time.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You should tackle the questions of the development of spirituality in a much greater sense than the few questions concerning religion at the end of the questionnaire.   Maybe one should ask what this experience taught us about 'humanity'.
