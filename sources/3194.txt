 This was the organ of John Humphrey Noyes's perfectionist utopian and communistic communities.  The group is most noted today for its advocacy of what would come to be called "karezza"--prolonged sexual intercourse without ejaculation for men.  In the early days and occasionally thereafter there were articles on the critical position the communities should take with regard to spiritualism, but that changed in the early 1870s when Noyes determined that his son's doubts and apostasy might be corrected by his close investigation of spiritualism as an antidote to materialism and step toward belief in the soul's immortality.  The last issue of the journal ran the prospectus of this journal's successor, the American Socialist, "A New Weekly Paper Devoted to Socialism."
