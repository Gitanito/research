My intensive care unit nurse decided I needed IV access and I am a very hard stick. After many attempts in the intensive care unit to get access to my veins, they went ahead and moved me to Progressive Care Unit. They asked the surgeon on call that day to put in a central line. I knew the doctor. While she was attempting to put in the central IV line in, I told her to put me in an emergency room because I was going to pass out. 

I then felt the most peace I have ever felt in my life. My mother was there to meet me and told me I had to come back that I was not through.
