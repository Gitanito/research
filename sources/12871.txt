  		              		Experience Description   

    I flew head over heels while training for a cross-country bicycle race. My chin hit the ground. Luckily the ground was sandy and soft, otherwise according to the neurologist I would likely have died. During my fall I flew up high and it became dark. 

  Then I stopped rising and found myself in the cosmos. I could see the earth as a huge ball. It was spectacular and hard to explain in words. Then I realized that this is impossible! I need to be down there since  I had fallen down. With this  thought,  I flew at an unknown speed toward the earth in a fraction of a second. But I did not go back into my body. I lingered in the air between the trees above my body. Then I thought, I need to go lower. Immediately, I shot toward my body. I re-entered my body head first and then slower, I entered the rest of my body. It took several minutes for my left leg to go back into my body. 

I wanted to stand up but quickly discovered I couldn't move. My hands, arms, feet and legs were totally numb.

One year after my experience I again exited my body and was joined by two entities who I didn't know. They showed me how to travel on that side and how thoughts function. They also gave me the feeling they could take me over. I couldn't understand any of it at the time. But later it became completely clear to me. I have since, with this knowledge been able to help other people who have problems.  

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes An old college friend once said to me, 'Before your accident you were a nice man but a poison frog. Now you are a nicer man, more patient and more concerned about your fellow humans.'  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I have been able to help other people. For example, I have taken away spirits twice. Although I didn't understand how it worked, I followed the directions of the entities.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          That I can help people from the other side seems important to me.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain,   From books  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     Especially the fact that it was difficult to get back to my body establishes for me the reality of this to me.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Because I have more experience with one side, that only confirms the authenticity of this.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   As mentioned.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I hope I have made clear all that happened to me.  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         This is very difficult to answer. You have to deal with the out of body experiences  of people, which each could be totally different. Many such experiences have a purpose. I was allowed to experience this myself.
