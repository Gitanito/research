A  Note on Science and NDE,    By  Simon Berkovich, Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at the George  Washington University.*

Below  is an introductory discussion of more theoretical papers exploring the idea that  DNA information in living organisms is not complex enough to explain the  quantity and diversity of information processed in and by the organism as a  whole, and by the brain in particular.

Instead,  it is postulated that the DNA information serves as a unique identification key  for a given organism, like a &quot;barcode.&quot;&nbsp;   As such, the brain is merely a transmitter and receiver of information,  but not the main place for storage or processing of information (i.e. memories)  http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0111093.&nbsp;  (see  also http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~berkov/Theory.htm  http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~berkov/Experiment.htm)

  The idea that Life and Mind processing of information involve activities beyond  ponder able matter flourished in the nineteenth century with the development of  the aether theory.&nbsp;  In the widely  acclaimed book of 1873, &quot;The Unseen Universe,&quot; Stewart and Tait wrote:

&quot;We attempt to show  that we are absolutely driven by scientific principles to acknowledge the  existence of an Unseen Universe, and by scientific analogy to conclude that it  is full of life and intelligence - that it is in fact a spiritual universe and  not a dead one.&quot;

  In the twentieth century, the paradigm shift of science has focused on  relativity, such that the idea of aether has been abandoned.&nbsp;   However, relativity has two interpretations.&nbsp;   The most commonly quoted is Einstein, who states that the absolute frame  of reference does not exist. Alternatively, according to Lorentz and Poincare,  the absolute frame of reference does exist but is undetectable[1]  .&nbsp;   Although  this may seem like a scholastic exercise in distinguishing between something  that does not exist and something that exists but is undetectable.&nbsp;   This is a pivotal point in the advancement of the knowledge about life.  &nbsp;

For  physics, adhering to either of these interpretations is inconsequential. For  biology, on the other hand, there are large consequences depending on which view  of relativity is espoused - particularly regarding attributes of the  informational infrastructure of the physical world.  &nbsp;

The  current scientific picture of the world hangs on the assumption that life is  merely a result of complex transformations of molecular structures. Under this  scientific assumption, many biological phenomena including the near death  experience should not exist.&nbsp;  What is  missing, in this assumption, is that the functioning of living systems has  little to do with physics and chemistry.&nbsp;  Primarily,  it is a problem of organization of information control.&nbsp;   For instance, if a living system is governed by an information processing  mechanism, it must follow regular principles of organization of information -  particularly, when this stipulation relates to the brain.  &nbsp;

Why  should a biological organism go along with the laws of physics and be exempt  from obeying the fundamental requirements of information processing?&nbsp;   These requirements are unquestionable.&nbsp;   But biological science usually avoids looking at informational processing  on an engineering level since the needs of information processing cannot be  satisfied by using conventional physics. In other words, the current scientific  paradigm for biological organisms can not sustain a routine engineering analysis  used by the methodology of information systems design.  &nbsp;

Biological  information processing must comply with &quot;the basic law of requisite  variety&quot; which states that achieving of appropriate selection &quot;is  absolutely dependent on the processing of at least that quantity of  information.&quot; Any biological work on information processing must respect  this law, &quot;or be marked as futile even before it has been started.&quot;  [2]      &nbsp;

The  observed diversification regarding the biology of life and mind cannot account  for the physical limitations of brain structure.&nbsp;   The amount of information in the human genome - about 30,000 genes - is  supposed to be the &quot;blueprint&quot; of human development.&nbsp;   In the digital world, this amount of information would be hardly enough  to portray a blur digital picture of a living being.&nbsp;   In comparison, worms have 18,000 genes.&nbsp;   The human brain consists of a relatively small amount of very slow  switching elements.&nbsp;  It is readily  apparent that the way genes are constructed, they simply cannot hold all the  information necessary to explain the human body.&nbsp;   Consequently, using the analogy of the brain to an information processing  device, it is impossible to account for information in the vast array of  possibilities that the brain uses.&nbsp;  The  situation is that &quot;When you try to prove an obvious thing it becomes less  obvious.&quot;      Cicero     . &nbsp;

Organisms  are characterized by DNA, much like library books are characterized by catalogue  numbers.&nbsp;  Therefore, the DNA can  contain a general description of the organism without having to contain detailed  instructions pertaining to structure and functionality.&nbsp;   This means that DNA contains marker information.&nbsp;   However, information on the way the body is built and how parts of the  body should function is contained elsewhere.  &nbsp;

The  &quot;barcode&quot; interpretation of DNA furnishes a natural explanation for  two anomalies commonly known as paradox N and paradox C.&nbsp;   Using the barcode analogy for paradox N, an organism can be built from an  information deficient genome.&nbsp;  Moreover,  the barcode analogy addresses paradox C and explains why more complex organisms  have less complex genomes. (Plants have more DNA than animals!).&nbsp;   The DNA molecules get control signals through communication, so shorter  structures acquire an operational edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;   In simple words, DNA is a label name and to a certain extent a shorter  name is an advantage.&nbsp;  Analogously,  the information processing capabilities of the brain do not depend on its size.

With  this as a background, the main point of http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0111093  explores the idea that the DNA information in living organisms is not a  repository of the control information for organism development.&nbsp;   The DNA role as a &quot;barcode&quot; determines the biological  individuality of organisms and hence enables their functioning as elements of a  system - &quot;the Internet of the physical Universe&quot;.&nbsp;

This  theory is consistent with information processing of consciousness which was  suggested by   Pim    van  Lommel ,  in the major NDE study released in a prime British  medical journal, The Lancet 12/01.   [3]     &nbsp;&nbsp; Van Lommel's closing  discussion pertaining to NDEs leaves the possibility open that the brain is  merely a receiver and that memories are stored elsewhere.&nbsp;   If the barcode theory holds and memory is stored elsewhere, then the way  we look at consciousness when separated from the body has some  profound implications on the way  society and religion is organized.   &nbsp;

The  role the DNA structures in nature can be compared to the role of Social Security  Numbers in the society.&nbsp;  (see also http://www.aps.org/meet/CENT99/vpr/laybc31-02.html  and http://www.aps.org/apsnews/0699/069905.html)&nbsp;   From my extensive studies, I would suggest that the controlling role of  DNA on information for organism development and functionality of memory comes  from outside of the physical body.&nbsp;  This  means that a different paradigm exists regarding the informational  infrastructure of the physical world.&nbsp;  In  other words, the human brain is not a stand-alone computer but rather a terminal  at the &quot;Internet of the physical Universe.&quot;&nbsp;

The  most difficult problem, from the standpoint of physics, is looking at how  memories are stored in the brain and is not likely to be &quot;affected by the  discovery of the final theory.&quot;&nbsp;  The  hidden meaning of this statement according to Weinberg, one of the world leading  physicists, is that the explanation of the brain organization would somehow come  independently of the development of modern physical theories.&nbsp;   However, the logical conclusion should be that there is a flaw in the  foundations of physics as long as it does not account for the major phenomenon  of nature like that seen in workings of the human brain.  &nbsp;

Modern  physics can only say that such an effect as NDE cannot exist.&nbsp;   In other words, from the standpoint of modern physics NDE is regarded as  &quot;anti-scientific.&quot;&nbsp;  However,  it is evident that no progress in biology can be achieved without challenging  the very fundamental notions in the construction of the physical Universe.&nbsp;   This is done in my paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0111093.&nbsp;  If the prediction of my theory - an  intrinsic anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - is verified,  then the global picture of the physical world must be reconsidered.  &nbsp;

At  any rate, modern physics runs into its own problems.&nbsp;   This is especially true with the alleged discovery that 65% of the  universal consists of an enigmatic &quot;dark energy.&quot;&nbsp;   Dark energy represents an addition to 30% of a mysterious &quot;dark  matter.&quot;&nbsp;  Dark energy is merely  a fictitious parameter that is introduced to keep up with Einstein's theory of  general relativity. Physicists are not ready yet to admit that this theory can  be wrong.&nbsp;  The   cosmological  model of the Universe based on Einstein's theory of general relativity would no  longer be a valid model.

  &nbsp;My theoretical model shows that the Universe is filled with information  for the control of living beings rather than with useless (from the standpoint  of biology)&nbsp;  &quot;dark&quot; matter  and &quot;dark energy.&quot;&nbsp;  The  model gives another meaning to these &quot;dark&quot; entities. The current view  on cosmology is lifeless, it can only hope that life should somehow pop up on  top of material processes.

  &nbsp;Thus, a comprehensive theory of Life and Mind should contemplate  extra-corporeal organization of cognitive information processing featuring the  brain as a &quot;network computer&quot; on the &quot;Internet&quot; of the  physical Universe.&nbsp;  The conventional  paradigm of modern science leaves no room for the rational explanation of NDE.&nbsp;   With the suggested model of extra-corporeal organization of biological  information processing, the phenomenon of NDE can undergo a meaningful rational  scrutiny.
