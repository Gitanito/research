welcome back blight cousins we got a
special report for you today coming up
in June
the disclosure project the national
Press Club it&#39;s all going down in DC
we&#39;ve got Dr Steven Greer with us right
now in regards to some breaking news of
what&#39;s going on and we&#39;ve got them how
are you doing today good been slam very
busy it&#39;s exciting what&#39;s happening you
know I&#39;ve been doing this for uh 33
years this is certainly the most dynamic
promising uh breakthroughs in disclosure
uh since uh 1940s uh by far and what
we&#39;re going to be doing for those of you
who can attend in person uh there are a
certain number of seats you can get for
the national Press Club event on uh the
12th of June which is that Monday at 2
p.m where the media and VIPs will be
present uh and then the two days before
that on June 10th and 11th we&#39;re going
to have two full days of uh top secret
military witness testimony
Witnesses who are whistleblowers from
the military in-house as well as a great
deal of evidence that&#39;s in our
disclosure intelligence archive that we
have and that will all be presented over
that two-day period now the public
National Press Club event
um that is on that Monday and of course
if you come you can come to all of them
uh you know if you register now it&#39;s
about a month away so we just wanted to
give everyone an update on what we&#39;re
going to be doing and what the breaking
news out of Washington is as you know
from my previous discussions we&#39;ve been
providing key information to the
investigators in Washington who are
trying to get to the bottom of this
issue and the very good news is they Now
understand that there really is an
unconstitutional and illegal and frankly
treasonous project going forward
on the UFO issue that does not have the
over site in control of the president or
the Congress now because they now know
that as a fact
there are things happening some of which
I cannot really talk about yet but I
will tell you that there are big
breakthroughs and uh that the game is
going to be up very soon in the next few
months so what we&#39;re trying to do is
prepare the public and all of you guys
for the changes that are coming uh over
the next six to 12 months as this all
begins to unfold and the national Press
Club event and the conference the
two-day conference before it uh there
will be people coming let me just give
you some like highlights of some of the
people who will be there in person we
have a person coming who was a marine
Battalion uh guy who was deployed to
Indonesia
after the big earthquake and tsunami in
2009 who uh his in his five buddies in
his platoon after they were dropped off
by a helicopter from their ship came
across a massive 300 foot in diameter uh
man-made UFO alien reproduction vehicle
offloading vast quantities of uh drugs
and illegal weapons uh there&#39;s multiple
corroborating witnesses to this they
were threatened with execution they were
forced to sign a non-disclosure
agreements he has come forward and has
been brought into the system already in
Washington into a skiff a secure uh
compartmented information facility but
he will be presenting live at the
two-day conference and briefly at the
national Press Club event we have
another gentleman
who was in the Air Force at the Nellis
so-called Area 51 complex and at
Wright-Patterson
who is coming forward he has been
brought already through that system uh
and but he will also uh most likely at
least be confirming what he has handed
over to the government and demanding
that this be followed up with we have a
gentleman who was on the USS Eisenhower
when a massive object as they were
beginning to enter before they entered
the Mediterranean
um and they were in the Atlantic came
over the ship and when they locked on it
with some of their targeting systems the
entire vessel went black all nuclear
systems were taken offline uh and this
guy is a crypto top secret uh nsacia a
cleared guy who was on the ship and he
the full information of that will be
provided we have another gentleman who
will be there who was at a
uh facility out in the desert of
California in the Mojave Desert a
training facility in 2000 and 2001 with
two Raytheon
um
officials when uh two different uh
man-made not extraterrestrial triangular
objects came in that were
electrogravidic and Silent uh and which
were that he had on his night Scopes and
saw and learned about them and then in a
subsequent event had one that was a
smaller one come to the front of his car
as he was entering the base and all the
electronics went down and these at this
entire event is an unbelievable series
of events that happen
um with this gentleman and then there&#39;s
a couple of others that are in the
process of being uh reviewed and seeing
if they feel comfortable coming forward
one uh is a man who was at the uh very
top secret state-of-the-art facility
much more so than Area 51 The dugway
Proving Grounds uh in Utah and he was
working for a corporation as a
contractor
and was in a facility where he saw
in the first time uh something that
looked like a partial human personal
extraterrestrial uh
person one was dead and one was alive
surrendered by scientists he thinks it
was an accident extraterrestrial but
something that had been some kind of
concocted genetic experiment
the other time he came into a facility
and there was a extraterrestrial vehicle
that was being examined by a group of
scientists in a clean room as it were
and he
has the full description of that the
date the where the sector the part of
the base even the building numbers and
code numbers where this happened we have
his information uh he also located an
entry point out in the desert uh with a
area where around a thousand cars were
parked with an opening and a small
building that went underground and the
scientists that he knew that worked
there said that this was a fast facility
around 1300 square miles
not Acres underneath deep underground
then we have a a series of folks who
have given us their information and that
we have their drawings of various other
events including a man who for 10 years
worked in a very deep black project at
the Pentagon uh where he was deployed to
various locations for example to one
base that was out in
Oklahoma I mean Fort Sill uh yep and and
near there in Lawton Oklahoma there was
a skiff an underground facility where
there was an extraterrestrial vehicle
that was being studied uh and the fact
that there was a security breach with
someone bringing in an unauthorized
person from Booze Allen Hamilton which
is a big contractor for the US
government who was trying to get a lead
a leg up on the contract to study how
this object could cloak quote unquote
itself he was also read in the projects
uh dealing with let&#39;s call it
invisibility Technologies and warfare
satellite weapon systems as well as
other facilities where there were
underground research projects
including the Research Triangle Park in
North Carolina and also down in uh
Orange County California underneath an
office building and he was also uh had
dealt with a facility outside Seoul
South Korea where there was a huge
extraterrestrial vehicle that they had
downed with apparently some type of
electronic warfare system that was in a
they had to carve out a huge part of the
mountain just to contain this option
because it was too big to move to any
other site and that it is still there so
this is just sort of like you know the
very tip of a vast uh
iceberg that we&#39;re going to start
unfurling here on June 10th 11th and
12th uh the men that are coming are of
course Very courageous and we are also
in the process of requesting that the
Congress pass an explicit Bill
protecting these guys pensions as well
as their physical security through
either the federal Marshal system uh
witness protection or some other system
so uh it&#39;s a very Dynamic events that
are happening
we&#39;ve also learned of a senior executive
with a major corporation which I do not
wish to name right now that we are
hoping can come forward he was the
chairman it&#39;s a it&#39;s a company everyone
would know the name of it that was
holding the Technologies the so-called
free Energy Technologies he has the
documents for it but he is of course
very concerned for his and his family
safety he&#39;s retired
uh and so we&#39;re working with that
um we&#39;re also working with a group of
people in the Congress to hold open
hearings on this uh subsequent to this
National Press Club event and uh
apparently some or a few of them could
be there at the conference so it&#39;s a
certainly the most significant forward
movement in the history of our attempts
to disclose this fully to the public uh
in history and I really hope all of you
can be there if you can&#39;t be there in
person you&#39;re going to miss probably the
biggest historic event ever but at least
you can be there we&#39;re going to live
stream all of it so there&#39;ll be a link
at this YouTube so you can get on on and
see this live
um the entire event not just the
national Press Club event but it&#39;s a
two-day conference where quite frankly
when you do a press conference in
Washington you got about two hours if to
get everything in but we&#39;re going to
have uh you know more like
you know 10 hours a day on Saturday and
Sunday June 10th and 12 11 to go through
all of this in Greater detail than you
can imagine uh so we&#39;re also going to
have some really uh amazing new uh
information on a lot of the objects that
have been downed and what they look like
what the ETS look like we have both the
original Witnesses
um military Witnesses sketches and then
professional artwork that&#39;s been done by
Michael schrad and his team so that
people can see what these uh et&#39;s
actually look like and what the craft
actually look like we&#39;re also going to
have a section of all the different
diverse
um
Raytheon
lockheed&#39;s corks Northrop Grumman
man-made UFOs and what they look like
you know how are they shaped how do they
resemble and differ from an
extraterrestrial vehicle all you&#39;re
going to learn all this all this is
going to be very clear and perhaps the
most stunning uh thing that you&#39;re going
to see
is the list of
750 or so military intelligence and
corporate whistleblowers that we now
have uh the ones that we can name
publicly will be on there the others
their names will be blackened out but
what they will testify to uh will be on
the document you will see uh you will
also be seeing a master facilities list
let me describe what this is this is the
actionable intelligence as they call it
from these hundreds of top secret
military whistleblowers where we&#39;re
going to name the basis the corporate
contractors the gates the code names the
the base underground location entry
points uh everything we have is going to
be in this document it will not be
redacted all of it&#39;s going to be
released publicly every bit of it
um and this is to be used by
the military and the Congress and the
Department of Justice and the White
House to put together a team to enter
and investigate these operations and get
them under constitutional control
one thing all of you need to understand
there are really two governments
globally there&#39;s the governments of the
we the people you vote for and they
appoint people and they come and go
every two four six eight years whatever
um that government does not have control
over this subject as of this moment uh
as we&#39;re recording this uh the truth is
is that there is a illegal secret
government it has now been the
assessment that has been reached we I
reached this assessment when I briefed
the director of the CIA for Bill Clinton
um but
in reality it&#39;s just now sinking in to
some key people in Washington who are in
the legal government that this is a big
problem so we hope that this can get
resolved in the next year so that our
civilization can move forward instead of
being arrested where we have been since
the 40s and 50s
and that brings me to the next big thing
that&#39;s going to happen on Sunday
um June uh 11th that night we&#39;re going
to have the first world screening not
the premiere but because that&#39;s in La at
LA Live on July 8th you should when we
announce that grab your tickets
um because there&#39;s a limited number of
seats there but at this event in
Washington DC on June 11th at night
we&#39;re going to have the screening of the
Lost century and how to reclaim it you
can see the trailer now
um and that will be coming out available
to the public on June 6th so by June
10th but this will be the first time you
could actually see it on a big screen uh
at the uh JW Marriott at the ballroom
where we&#39;re going to be holding that
conference and then afterwards we&#39;re
going to have an after party for those
of you who want to comment and uh party
hardy I&#39;ll have to have some fun so
um so let&#39;s take a look at that trailer
yeah let&#39;s do it okay
the Lost Century the need trailer it&#39;s
going to be in DC in June watch this
unidentified flying objects is an
obfuscating term this is an alternative
energy and propulsion device
between the late 1800s and now the
ingenious inventions and Sciences have
all been ruthlessly suppressed
confiscated
it reads like James Bond movie but it&#39;s
real it happened here in the United
States
we Master gravity control here on Earth
not a successful
these are projects that are off the
radar even of the people who manage the
Black Project
when someone asks me how bad is the
crisis I kind of don&#39;t know where to
begin so there&#39;s something nefarious to
put
these Technologies within fossil fuels
pollution and poverty overnight that&#39;s
pretty intriguing
this lost Century of technologies that
have existed that have vanished is the
biggest cover-up scandal in the history
of the world
oh
all right well you know it is quite
incredible like it&#39;s been 22 years since
the national Press Club a little over
that and you know hundreds of millions
of people watch that across the planet I
Gotta Feeling what you&#39;re telling me
today is you&#39;ve got these whistleblowers
that work within the government you know
verified government retired officials
coming forth with this shocking uh
information in regards to the cover-up
and you&#39;re saying that some of the safe
there&#39;s some safety concerns how do
these people actually reach out to you
and uh and when did they come to you and
say hey look this is what I know but I&#39;m
afraid of coming forth what kind of
protections can you give me how does
that kind of roll out well they use the
right to our website uh
seriousdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s-disclosure.com and under the
contact bar
um button there&#39;s a list for government
whistleblowers Witnesses and so
generally they come in that way some of
them are referred by other people uh the
one I just got off the phone with uh
just before this who is the one of the
Nellis uh Area 51 Air Force guys uh he
was referred to me by a
highly classified person because this
man still works for the US government
under a top secret special compartmented
information clearance
um and he was referred to me by someone
on the inside so they come through
diverse ways but most of them through
our website and I would say also anyone
who is listening or who may know someone
who would be such a witness and
whistleblower they should contact us
because there&#39;s still time to bring them
into this National Press Club event
we&#39;re adding to the roster of folks
coming forward every couple days now
and I will tell you that we have about
two or three new uh top secret military
intelligence and corporate
whistleblowers coming into our
disclosure project operation every week
now
so this is beginning to be it&#39;s a bit
much but as you know we don&#39;t have any
paid staff or offices so with you know
the people working with us on me we&#39;re
getting a bit bit overwhelmed but um
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s exciting because so all
this is breaking forward
um the other big announcement about this
is that I&#39;ve met with some people with
the key Committee in the House
Representatives who have decided they
want to hold open
as opposed to classify hearings on this
um and one of the things you&#39;re going to
see at this two-day event on on June
10th and 11th is an overview of this
five terabyte intelligence hard drive
that we&#39;re handing off to these
investigators and it is everything
um it&#39;s everything of consequence and
evidence on the subject that we can find
uh and to that end by the way if people
are holding a government documents or
other key evidence that they think we
should include in this archive they
should contact us like right away
because we&#39;re in the final process of at
least this first draft of this
disclosure or intelligence archive being
assembled and organized at least rough
organized I mean it&#39;s going to take a
year to do it properly to hand off to
the investigators in Washington because
this is a rapidly evolving situation so
we want to get most of what we have into
their hands by June 1st before the
national Press Club event
you with all the information that&#39;s
coming forth especially in regards to
this like clandestine black projects and
when you&#39;re talking about these ships
that are still buried there because it
was so large they couldn&#39;t even relocate
it is this going to rile the government
up some of these congressmen and these
Senators because these last hearings
that they&#39;ve been putting forth really
don&#39;t amount to much but what you&#39;re
bringing forth is eyewitness testimony
verifiable uh people that work within
the government how is this going to
change the minds are we going to be able
to get access to uh some of these
locations this ship that&#39;s buried uh
what&#39;s your thoughts on this is riling
things up this is this is big stuff yeah
oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s everything isn&#39;t
upheaval I will tell you that right now
and the people on the wrong side of the
law on this are Running Scared and they
should be so here&#39;s what here&#39;s what I&#39;m
going to say
I would be very clear on this it that
now is the time over the next
now would be best but over the next
six to 12 months to get on the right
side of the law on this because the
deception with the leaders in Washington
over and after June 12th the deception
with the public will be over
but the of course as a private
non-governmental entity uh we don&#39;t have
uh law enforcement capability we don&#39;t
have a Strike Team we don&#39;t have
subpoena power but the FBI Department of
Justice the Pentagon universal code of
military Justice Provisions their their
laws uh as as well as the Congress
committees and oversight and uh the
presidential Powers all have that
ability the best we can do is to advise
them give them the evidence but also
give them the road map where are these
assets which corporations have them who
are the individuals who are willing to
come forward under oath and be
subpoenaed and testify about this now
the only other way is an organization we
could do it and it would probably cost
between five and ten million dollars is
to Institute a civilian
Rico action racketeering influence
corrupt organization and you can as a
private individual or organization such
as ours you can Institute one of those
uh which is basically Rico is for like
the mafia or organized crime because we
have enough evidence and Witnesses now
to prove that this organization is in
fact a criminal illegal Enterprise and
so it would squarely fall under Rico but
again unless somebody has a huge Law
Firm willing to do this pro bono for
free or someone who can fund that which
we don&#39;t have funding of that amount at
this point uh then the next best thing
and the preferred route anyway would be
the Executive Branch the White House and
the Congress
authorizing a full investigation and
hearings and if necessary subpoenas and
prosecution uh after a period of amnesty
now as you know a lot of people don&#39;t
know this when President Clinton was
looking into this before he got waived
off by George H.W bush and told to butt
out
um and by the way we have a person
coming forward who
I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll be there
um who actually was with Bill Clinton
when Bill Clinton told him that when he
tried to get into the bottom of this and
he was pushed out and told to leave it
alone by former President George H.W
bush who also had been director of the
CIA back in the day but when when
Clinton was looking into this I wrote a
series of executive orders but also
recommendations one of them was
an amnesty period where top secret
Witnesses and corporate folks
even if they had greatly benefited
financially or committed certain High
crimes misdemeanors felonies would have
an amnesty for a period of time
so that they could come forward in fact
this you this will you will see this in
the in the intelligence archive we&#39;re
going to eventually get to the public
um and uh unfortunately Clinton never
could take it that far because he
basically got threatened and pushed
aside uh when during he was during his
attempts to get to the bottom of this
back in the 90s after you know we
provided the briefing materials for him
and then I had briefed the his first CIA
director But ultimately uh
we we are very much in favor of there
being a
bloodless Revolution here let&#39;s call it
like yeah like in Eastern Europe where
this information comes out the Rogue
elements get pulled back under proper
constitutional oversight and control by
we the people&#39;s government and more
importantly we the people because
ultimately
secret projects in the government are
always subject to corruption this is the
danger of too much secrecy uh so and and
luckily there are some people I mean
such as there&#39;s a a congressman from
Tennessee named Congressman Tim burchett
who uh has been very vocal about the
fact that the current process of this
being uh Witnesses coming before uh in a
pentagon program the Aero program that
then goes to a classified briefing for a
few members of Congress uh it&#39;s just not
going to cut it because you know after
70 80 years of this kind of secrecy he
and many of his colleagues actually are
now saying that it has to Pivot to an
open Congressional hearing but that
isn&#39;t some stupid dog and pony show like
uh Gerald Ford had when he was in the
Congress and others have had that it
would be actually a hard-hitting
investigation and luckily here&#39;s here&#39;s
what&#39;s important about this
intelligence archive we&#39;re providing
because it has enough
people&#39;s names and information to be
subpoenaed and it has the full
facilities list and I mean everything
we&#39;ve collected of every place that is
relevant to get into uh they would have
enough
uh Quivers you know all right they would
have an Affairs in their quiver to be
able to really penetrate those projects
and get them under control uh but it&#39;s
important that people who would want to
come clean uh would be given a period of
amnesty because some of them have gotten
called up in these projects uh and they
once they were in they couldn&#39;t get out
and if they tried to get out they would
be assassinated uh but in there being in
if they were high enough in the system
they did benefit tremendously
financially and uh personally so those
people actually if they could be given a
period of amnesty to come forward in the
interest of the country and of the of
humanity I think that would be a good
thing it&#39;d be a win-win situation and
it&#39;s not at all to excuse
atrocities that have happened over the
years with this at all
um and you know if any I very well aware
of people have been victimized by these
systems and who have been killed and
defamed and so these kinds of witnesses
intimidation felonies entrapments
murders some of the people who&#39;ve done
those things that&#39;s beyond the pale but
there are other people who&#39;ve been in
the system who have not been involved in
those operations uh who are still need
protection but also need amnesty so that
is one of the things we&#39;re strongly
recommending and I think particularly in
the corporate sector because the thinner
gravity on this issue when Eisenhower
warned about the military-industrial
complex he was really talking about this
hybrid
quasi-government
quasi-private Financial corporate world
that has benefited tremendously from the
secrecy not only in terms of keeping the
free Energy Technologies away from the
public and protecting you know a
thousand trillion dollars worth of
Assets in oil and gas and coal and
Public Utilities but
the spin-off Technologies one of the
guys I was talking to today who is a Air
Force guy he was in charge of monitoring
the conversations with Scientists
working on the Extraterrestrial
materials and how they would take it and
if once it was cleared to be okay to go
to the public would be allowed to
personally benefit and their corporation
contractors to benefit by patenting some
breakthrough and bringing it to Market
and of course Colonel Corso talked about
this uh on the day after after Roswell
about the early material from Roswell
and other crash retrievals but that
project has been actually greatly
increased over the last 30 years and so
this creates only a revenue stream for
people in these illegally run projects
but uh it it also uh shows how how much
the American public has paid for but
then have been subsequent currently
robbed of so you know we paid through
black budget illegal parts of the black
budget not the legal Parts
um and by the way this is another thing
we&#39;re going to deconstruct and and uh
disclose and unveil is the difference
between the black budget of the United
States and the illegal secret government
black budget and how they&#39;re funded and
where the inner interface is and very
few people understand this in fact this
is one of the first things I&#39;ve had to
describe and discuss with senior
investigators in Washington over the
last year and a half because some of the
folks I&#39;m working with literally oversee
the black budget of the United States
and yet they knew nothing about the UFO
issue they knew nothing about these
corporate programs they knew nothing
about the technology transfer
and this patenting process and they knew
nothing about the illegal arms and Drug
running that creates an enormous
untraceable cash flow
that is clearly a criminal Enterprise so
uh that that&#39;s why all of this needs to
start getting under control because it&#39;s
a monster uh Frankenstein that we
created through the classified system in
the 40s and 50s that then got up and
walked off at Frankenstein got up and
walked off the table uh in the 50s and
Eisenhower completely lost control of
these operations no fault of his own I
mean he he basically trusted the people
around him and he was betrayed
um some of something I can relate to
very well but I think that ultimately uh
it&#39;s now time for all this to get fixed
and uh that&#39;s where the Lost Century
comes in because look at the subtitle of
this documentary The Lost century and
how to reclaim it in other words it&#39;s a
it&#39;s one thing to kavach and complain
about the state of the world and
everything and secrecy and cover-ups and
blah blah blah
but then how do you fix it how do you
reclaim those laws 100 years well there
is a way to do it and that&#39;s what&#39;s also
outlined in the documentary because I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s that to be honest with
you Blake there&#39;s no value in describing
a problem and stirring around the muck
unless you have a way to suggest a
solution to go forward and so I think
it&#39;s very important that we not just
muckrake and complain about the secrecy
um however salacious some of it is but
we also say here&#39;s how we fix it not
only from the governmental point of view
but from the environmental and energy
and Technology point of view how do we
do what I call a Time snap where we pull
back uh you know we basically Back to
the Future we basically bring into the
now the Lost opportunities technologies
that were in a fully operational a
hundred years ago 70 years ago uh even
the anti-gravity lifter system so the
field propulsion those
were mastered in October of 1954.
which also news flashers and other
talking point to look for at the
national Press Club
when they showed the Tic Tac
and I&#39;ve spoken to David fraver who is
the F-18 Hornet
pilot for the Navy chasing that object
there off the coast San Diego uh you
know everyone&#39;s been told gee is it from
China is it this is it that that was one
of ours
and what&#39;s interesting we have the
information from the gentleman who is in
1991.
at a in a classified operation during
the first Gulf War
and being offloaded at the Azores
Islands
from a C-130 transport was the Tic Tac
and that was whatever whatever you know
we&#39;re talking about 30 years uh for 20
20 years to be 23 years before you know
the F-18 Hornet that David forever flew
chased it and then you go back to a case
in uh Pennsylvania
uh where multiple Witnesses saw exactly
the same thing the Tic Tac floating over
the countryside
and for which we have the uh reporting
and a very good professional drawing of
that object so I think part of this also
is is unveiling the risk of these false
flag operations where things that look
alien can be deployed to deceive the
public to deceive our own pilots and
Military like these Navy pilots and
deceive the Congress and the media so I
think it&#39;s very important that all of
this come out but that these these dots
get connected so that people understand
why this is important because in the
secrecy and let&#39;s call it the enforced
secrecy that results in the ignorance on
this subject the Congress the president
the media the American public could be
tricked uh into a false flag event
thinking that it was of extraterrestrial
origin when it&#39;s actually of human
origin designed for its psychological
warfare value so that&#39;s another whole
part of disclosure that has to happen uh
and it has to happen quickly because as
this train this freight trains left the
station
from a governmental investigatory point
of view
the question is will this covert
cabal of illegal operations hit the
button and start staging thanks
trick us into a world war three trick us
into an alien invasion World of War
which of course they&#39;ve been planning
for 70 years I think that time in this
sense is very much not on our side and
it&#39;s for that reason I think we have to
be able to go uh expeditiously forward
on this let&#39;s get in let&#39;s get into the
whistleblower&#39;s head here because with
what you&#39;re saying time is Paramount
here is that some of the reasons why
these uh whistleblowers are coming forth
now what is their major concern and
what&#39;s what is their demeanor when
you&#39;re worse when you&#39;re speaking with
them and just are these regular U.S
citizens obviously they&#39;re connected
with the military but what is their
demeanor and why are they coming forward
now
they&#39;re coming for it now because
they&#39;ve seen that enough of this is
beginning to leak out and when we put
out to the public
and singer uh Chris Brown then dropped
that link has did a lot of other
supportive uh influencers and it got
seen by millions of people and the point
I was making it those of you who want to
see us should go back and see the this
Ron uh Sean Ryan Show I was on and I
believe uh
February or March that
was an appeal to Military Intelligence
corporate whistleblowers to come forward
and we made the case for it that the the
Congress passed and the president signed
two days before Christmas uh in December
uh the National Defense authorization
Act of basically the bill that funds the
Pentagon that had a provision in it for
UFO UAP
whistleblowers and witnesses to come
forward even with their security
clearances and even with their
non-disclosure agreements in place
and to do so safely without a penalty
without legal repercussions and without
their pensions or anything else being
threatened so that we announced widely
as soon as it happened if you remember
in January and February
um and so not only through those
podcasts like the Sean Ryan Show and
many others but through our own system
and that caused for example we had a
elderly YouTube spy plane pilot from the
60s come forward and he had been
following our work for over 20 years but
until that law was passed he was never
comfortable coming forward
um to speak because there was no legally
sanctioned protected way to do it well
now there is so uh I think that that
made a big difference in that as you
know was something that I was advocating
and and over the last couple years was
helping with
providing some guidance on the wording
of it you know the early version of that
provision left out all the contractors
and I said whoa the we&#39;re the biggest
center of gravity is in the Contracting
world that&#39;s where it&#39;s all at yeah
that&#39;s where most of it&#39;s at so they
then changed the wording to cover those
guys as well so that&#39;s very important
but now we need another provision that
it more explicitly
even though it&#39;s implied in the current
law it protects their pensions but also
I think we have to get this amnesty uh
period uh in place you know whether it&#39;s
six months or a year uh I I it can&#39;t be
open-ended uh because it has to have
teeth
uh and you know this is something I&#39;ve
been recommending since 1993 and 94. I
can prove it uh but I think that now
beginning I think there are people in
the US government now who understand
that that&#39;s really needed that because
now they have enough evidence to know
that this is a legitimate area of real
concern so uh in the corporate sector
and uh and it would need to have teeth
where you know there&#39;s x amount of time
you come forward you come clean you
disclose everything to the legal
constitutional government or you will be
prosecuted period so that is something
that I&#39;ve been wanting to see happen and
I&#39;m hoping that with what we do after
the national Press Club event and we
will articulate this at the national
Press Club briefly uh the rationale for
these uh laws that need to be put in
place uh because that I think is going
to be the safe safest way to get the
highest
valuable people to come forward
who are embedded in the corporate world
like this this very senior executive
which was a major corporation who wants
to come forward but is afraid of having
his wealth confiscated and also his
family and he being you know quite
frankly assassinated so uh there need to
be very clear Provisions uh for that and
I think once the members of Congress and
other people in the white house I&#39;m
dealing with some military people in the
white house
um understand the gravitas and the
severity of the situation I&#39;m hoping
that they will all support those sort of
Provisions that will make it safer uh
faster easier for uh folks like that to
come forward transparently
you know the the information five
terabytes you&#39;re bringing forth the
eyewitnesses this is going to be
something that is kind of unprecedented
we haven&#39;t seen anything like this it&#39;s
completely unprecedented and this is
this is going to be um something that
people need to watch they need to get
the word out so we&#39;re going to be
supplying the original links below to
all the events and uh how you could
participate in it but what about the the
guys in Washington this is taking place
in BC uh how many people are going to be
showing up like Congressman uh senators
are they gonna you&#39;re gonna be dropping
this information to them we we have no
idea
um you know look these things are
evolving a lot of people show up at the
last minute
um this is why we&#39;re holding back in the
ballroom of the national Press Club uh a
hundred seats for people who could just
pop in uh who are these sort of of folks
from Pentagon White House Congress
Etc
um and I think the similar for the
two-day conference we&#39;re holding back a
capacity for that uh we don&#39;t know
because there were a month out and you
know a lot of people who are those kind
of very busy folks it gets on their
radar and at the last month I say gee
I&#39;m going to come now here&#39;s something
everyone listening can do you can write
to your member of Congress you all have
one representative and two senators and
the president
those four people each of you should
write to and say this is happening
here&#39;s the link you can come for free
you can see the entire event for free
and provide a link all right now why is
that important because at a certain
point
these elected political figures need to
hear from their
constituents because those are the
people that put them in office
uh and I think that this is where when
people are apathetic and don&#39;t act then
they can&#39;t complain about the state of
the country frankly I mean if you don&#39;t
do anything about it and this takes what
you know an hour for you to write this
out and then send it to these four would
take an hour
um but everyone should take half an hour
at their time and do this and as they do
it now right now it only takes five
minutes now with chat gbt yeah so uh you
know I but it&#39;s everyone can do that and
I know you know the people in in these
political spheres uh
if enough people write on any particular
issue it will be shown to the member of
Congress or the Senate
um so I think it&#39;s very important same
thing at the White House I mean these
these are all creatures of both
publicity and what they&#39;re hearing from
from their uh their customers or their
constituents so and and it&#39;s also
important that people help us find more
and more influencers
um
because remember the mainstream media
tends to ignore these sort of bold steps
forward they all they want to cover you
know superficial G we don&#39;t know what
these are rubbish sort of things uh
something like this that&#39;s going to have
all the evidence proof and
whistleblowers they tend to ignore uh
and so thank goodness now however with
social media and the internet and people
can then write to their members uh that
Dynamic is no longer the the control of
a handful of media Moguls right so that
democratization of the system which the
internet social media is allowed we need
to utilize that very heavily in the next
30 days and then uh at that point we&#39;ll
see I mean I always tell people look you
know an unfunded you know operation like
this I mean we have no institutional
Government funding we have a few donors
who provide some money and we have some
admission fees to events we do which
pays for guess what every one of these
top secret guys we&#39;re bringing to DC not
just the ones who are coming to our
event in June but the ones we&#39;ve been
bringing we&#39;re paying for their airfare
they&#39;re lodging their drivers their
security
uh weirdo not the government so you know
people who covetch about this I go well
you know if what do you want if you want
this done you know put your money where
your mouth is so that&#39;s the other thing
we need some major donations to come in
in the next year we will spend at least
450 to 500 000 on this effort
um and we don&#39;t have that kind of
Revenue so uh we need folks to step up
to the plate and help us with that as
well with funding
you know that&#39;s going to be a Powerhouse
and uh like you said you&#39;re covering the
cost you&#39;re actually putting out the
national Press Club you&#39;re streaming it
live for free on your channel this is uh
something with all the work five
terabytes of information I&#39;ve been
speaking with Michael schrat he&#39;s been
working his ass off to be frank you know
you guys there&#39;s a lot of moving Parts
here oh yeah lift off and get it all
together in these three days coming up
in June uh I I you know I can&#39;t wait a
lot of people can&#39;t wait and this kind
of benefits 99.9 of the world&#39;s
population
exactly zero point one percent that&#39;s
afraid of this information getting out
so uh this is something that&#39;s uh quite
extraordinary and we&#39;re excited about it
is there any uh last thing you want to
add in to this
well one thing is that the the Lost
Century uh and how to reclaim it it
doesn&#39;t draw Fully Alive until
um June 6th but right now you can
pre-order it on Vimeo eventually people
can get it before then
um and I also want people just to put on
their calendars if you want to come to
the world premiere of it on July 8th
that&#39;s a Saturday in Los Angeles at LA
Live just put it on your calendar we we
haven&#39;t started actually promoting that
because we&#39;re covered up with this event
in Washington but just keep that in mind
that&#39;ll be a great event on a huge
screen at LA Live with uh hundreds of
people and we&#39;re also have a fun after
party there too we always have work hard
play hard yeah absolutely and hey and
don&#39;t forget uh UFO end game to
disclosure that&#39;s something he could uh
catch up right now it&#39;s available
worldwide and uh that&#39;s been uh crushing
it we&#39;re on a tear with that it&#39;s taking
the number one spots on Amazon and
iTunes but then the Lost century is
coming around and uh looking forward to
watching that and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to
be very insightful you know you say
there&#39;s it&#39;s not just about revealing it
and complaining about what&#39;s going on
but then there you have these uh things
in this documentary that gives us ways
that it could be fixed and uh that&#39;s
important right it it out it proves the
subject it proves the science the
history the problem of suppression but
then it has a very clear path of how to
fix it so every problem that someone
finds they need to find a way to fix it
uh and where you know Cosmic let&#39;s fix
it sort of guys here so uh but that also
is going to take a a lot of millions of
people learning about this
and supporting any effort to bring the
Technologies out uh as I have suggested
before open source no patents no
holdbacks no intellectual property
holdbacks uh the the initial
circuitry and Science and physics needs
to be practically developed and released
uh freely so that thousands of companies
and startups can begin to use it so we
get off the current energy Paradigm and
start a civilization that is sustainable
uh without poverty and that is saves the
Earth&#39;s biosphere uh it can be done it
can be done in 10 to 20 years uh
just but and frankly that&#39;s about how
much time we have left before things
really take a bad turn uh from a
geophysical and environmental point of
view so I I hope that people will when
they see that understand that that&#39;s
also a call to action it&#39;s an aspect of
the whole call to action of disclosure
because part of the disclosure project
has always been it&#39;s not just the
information and the secrecy and the
existence of these projects and of
extraterrestrial intelligence and what
have you it has to be disclosed it&#39;s the
Practical disclosure of the science and
technology that would give us an
entirely new and beautiful civilization
you know that you know our children and
Grand I have now 12 grandchildren would
actually have a prosperous peaceful and
and very clean planet to live on so if
not now when not us who I mean this has
been dragged on now for 100 years uh we
don&#39;t have another 100 years my friends
to Fritter away uh the air and the water
and the land okay we need to get this on
now and catch up with the Lost century
well said Dr Guerrera appreciate you
