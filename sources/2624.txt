PREFACE
STUDENTS of American life have long been impressed by the
remarkable breadth of interests shown by many leading public
men a century ago. Just because they dispersed their efforts
so widely, however, some of these have gradually and rather
undeservedly faded from the pages of history. In such a group
belongs Robert Dale Owen, one of the most versatile figures in
an age of versatility. As editor, educator, and labor leader, as
politician, diplomat, and man of letters, as legislator, feminist,
and champion of a new religious faith, as advocate at one time
or another of all sorts of reforms ranging from birth control to
Negro emancipation, and as author of all sorts of books from
theological discussions to treatises on architecture and plank
roads, Owen was one of the best known and most publicized
men of his generation. Surprisingly enough, he has been also
one of the most neglected. To be sure, his name is familiar to
specialists in social history and to those seeking to keep alive
Indiana's past; but the absence of a critical, full length biog-
raphy, based on more materials than Owen's writings alone and
portraying in detail the vicissitudes of his thought and activity,
has led scholars into frequent errors concerning his career and
has obscured from the general reader a man whose life tells us
much about the America of a hundred years ago. It is to repair
such a deficiency that this work has been undertaken.
In attempting to recover Owen from unwarranted obscurity,
I have guarded against exaggerating the importance of a man
who performed ably in many fields but achieved greatness in
none. Possessed of a mind more facile than consistent, more
receptive than original, Owen frequently changed his opinions,
even on such fundamental issues as capitalism, religion, edu-
cational methods, and the rights of the Negro. He was not
always a reformer; he was not always an "incorrigible ideal-

ist." His biography cannot be fitted into one mold; his place in
history cannot be summarized in a phrase.
Fundamental to any comprehension of Owen's career is the
fact that he lived not one life but three. Responding to his
various environments, he was in turn a radical reformer, intent
on eliminating all irrationalities and injustices in the world;
an able politician, eager to promote the interests of an expand-
ing, self-assertive West; and finally a cosmopolitan intellectual,
dabbling as a free lance in the problems of the Civil War, rely-
ing upon his pen for a livelihood, but concerned primarily with
the propagation of spiritualism. Between these three periods
of Owen's life there was only a tenuous connection. The actors,
as well as the setting, constantly changed. During the New
York years Owen promised to become the country's outstand-
ing social critic and freethinker, but in the forties he turned
his back on the many humanitarian crusades of the day and
within another decade abandoned his militant agnosticism for
a creedless Christianity. During the Indiana years Owen stood
high in the ranks of the Western Democracy, but in the sixties
he broke with his old party and demanded suffrage for the
Negro he had helped to exclude from the Hoosier state. Dur-
ing his last years Owen was, perhaps, America's ablest advocate
of spiritualism; but by combatting radicals within the fold and
exposing mediums of doubtful moral character, he gained the
enmity of those who came to control the movement and has
thus been conveniently relegated to oblivion by later spiritual-
ists. Hence there is no group, no cause, no party, outside of
Indiana, which seeks today to perpetuate his fame.
Yet on many occasions Owen came near to achieving lasting
renown. A brilliant career in radical journalism was prevented
only by his return in 1833 to the Indiana backwoods. If the
influence of Moral Physiology could be accurately determined,
he might be known as a leading pioneer writer on sociological
problems. His name might have been enshrined in the annals
of the Smithsonian Institution if he had not, apparently, dis-

might have been made secure if in 1852, after helping devise
the Hoosier public school system, he had consented to run for
the office of State Superintendent and thus perfect the organi-
zation. Had he not lived his most fruitful years in southern
Indiana, he might today be remembered among feminists with
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth C. Stanton and among aboli-
tionists with William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Dwight
Weld. But these are all might-have-beens. The fact remains
that Owen is largely forgotten, and the fault is partly his.
Although no large collection of Owen's papers has survived,
the sources for this study are abundant. The biographers prob-
lem has been to condense and to select, without omitting or
neglecting any of his subject's multifarious interests, those
interests that make him so significant. In order to depict Owen
as he was seen by foe as well as by friend, it has been necessary
to go beyond his own writings, printed and unprinted, and seek
information in manuscripts, scattered from Portland, Oregon,
to Manchester, England, as well as in broken files of news-
papers, buried away in local Indiana libraries. This research
was assisted by two fellowship grants, one from the Social
Science Research Council in 1935-1936 and one from Harvard
University in 1936-1937.
It is a pleasure to acknowledge some of the kindnesses that
facilitated the writing of this biography. I am under deep
obligation to several members of the Owen family, to Mrs.
Grace Zaring Stone and Mrs. Aline Owen Neal for permission
to use manuscripts in their possession, and to Miss Caroline
Dale Snedeker and the late Rosamond Dale Templeton for
information and advice. Other manuscripts, still in private
hands, were made available by Mrs. Donald R. Macdonald,
the Misses Mary Fretageot and Louise Embree, and the Rev-
erend Thomas C. Pears, Jr. Transcripts of Owen letters in the
Lane and Brownson Papers have been courteously supplied by
Miss Nellie B. Pipes and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. The
Honorable William L. Bryan furnished me with extracts from
the minutes of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University.

I am indebted to the New Harmony Memorial Commission for
being allowed to reproduce the Wilson portrait of Owen now
hanging in the Old Fauntleroy Home. Of the many librarians
who have been indefatigable in their efforts I can single out for
special thanks only Miss Esther U. McNitt and Dr. Christopher
B. Coleman, of the Indiana State Library, and Miss Louise M.
Husband and the late Nora C. Fretageot, of the Workingmen's
Institute, New Harmony.
I wish to acknowledge, finally, the assistance rendered by
my colleagues at Harvard University. The manuscript was read
in its various stages by Professors Frederick Merk and Paul H.
Buck. Their comments, growing out of their wide knowledge
of the field covered, as well as their cheerfully given advice,
were extremely helpful. But my greatest debt of gratitude is
to Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger, who first suggested the
subject to me and who, over a period of several years, has given
me unsparingly of his time. Without his genial humor, constant
encouragement, and stimulating criticism this work would not
have been possible.

BACKGROUNDS
AMONG the most versatile figures in American social history is
Robert Dale Owen. Born before the day of the specialist,
possessed of a facile pen, an extraordinary adaptability, and
a strong faith in human progress, he engaged in a myriad of
activities, wrote on a wide variety of subjects, and performed
useful services in many fields. Though largely forgotten to-
day, he was in the half century after 1825 one of the best
known and most publicized men of his time. His biographer
is faced with the problem of portraying not one life but several;
for, yielding to his changing environments, Owen was in turn
a radical reformer, a Western Democrat, and a cosmopolitan
intellectual.
Robert Dale Owen was born in Charlotte Street, Glasgow,
on November 7, 1801. He entered a world seething with strife
and unrest. Not until his fourteenth birthday did Great Britain
finally emerge from the shadow of Napoleon. Peace abroad
did not bring peace at home. The post-war collapse in prices
caused widespread depression and unemployment; the dis-
tressed workers not unnaturally attributed their plight to the
introduction of the new labor-saving machinery.
The Industrial Revolution in England was in 1801 still in its
infancy. Steam power was not widely used; transportation of
bulk awaited Macadam and the canals; the large scale pro-
duction of iron and steel lay in the distant future. Only in a
few branches of manufacture, notably the textile, had the adop-
tion of mechanical devices brought into being the modern
factory system. With the birth pangs of that system Owen's
family was intimately connected. His maternal grandfather,
one time partner of Richard Arkwright, had in 1786 opened
the first Scottish owned cotton spinning factory. His father

Robert Dale Owen was born in Charlotte Street, Glasgow,
on November 7, r8or. He entered a world seething with strife
and unrest. Not until his fourteenth birthday did Great Britain
finally emerge from the shadow of Napoleon. Peace abroad
did not bring peace at home. The post-war collapse in prices
caused widespread depression and unemployment; the dis-
tressed workers not unnaturally attributed their plight to the

duction of iron and steel lay in the distant future. Only in a

family was intimately connected. His maternal grandfather,
one time partner of Richard Arkwright, had in 1786 opened
the first Scottish owned cotton spinning factory. His father
4 ROBERT DALE OWEN
was, a generation later, widely known as one of the most suc-
cessful industrialists in the United Kingdom. Owen himself
passed his boyhood in close proximity to his father's mills and,
like many others who came of age in the days of Teterloo, was
keenly aware of the human misery that followed in the wake of
the inventions of Kay, Hargreaves, and Crompton.
In his autobiography Owen traced his ancestry to a great-
great-great-grandfather, the first Earl of Breadalbane.
1
That
claim to noble blood had a curious ring coming from one who
in his earlier years had endorsed communism, championed the
cause of labor, and lived for two decades under the democratic
influence of the American West. There had been a time when
Owen, like Webster, would have rejoiced to have been born in
a log cabin. American log cabins, however, were a far cry from
the palatial Charlotte Street home in which Owen first saw the
light of day and in which lived his maternal grandparents,
David and Ann Campbell Dale, Of the latter, who bequeathed
to Owen her noble lineage but not her extraordinary beauty,
little is known except that she died some years before her grand-
son's birth. David Dale, on the other hand, was one of Glas-
gow's leading citizens. By sheer ability he had risen from
humble origins to become a magistrate of the city, an officer
of the Royal Bank, and a wealthy manufacturer, Although
he belonged to the first generation of mill owners, Dale set a
splendid example in providing decent working conditions for
his employees. He died in 1805; but his strong social con-
science, his practical philanthropy, and his ardent Calvinism
were a continuing influence upon the environment in which his
grandson grew to manhood.2
Dale's deep religious fervor was inherited by his eldest
daughter, Ann Caroline, That Owen's mother fed her children
the Presbyterian creed in generous doses is not to be doubted,

but that fact is given undue emphasis in her son's autobiogra-
phy.
3
As a young lady she was cheerful, gregarious, and self-
reliant, not afraid to give her hand to an utter agnostic. As a
parent she was loving and tender, and the devotion that she
inspired is evident in the few surviving letters that young Owen
wrote before her death.
4
Ann Caroline never interfered with
the public career of her husband, though in the last years it
led to virtual separation. Nor did she hinder her four sons
from seeking their happiness in the New World across the
sea.
It is unlikely that there was any noble blood in the Owen
strain. The boy's paternal grandmother came from a family of
fairly prosperous farmers of Newtown, Montgomeryshire. Her
husband, Robert Owen the elder, was born of poor parents at
Welsh Pool in the same county. Settling in Newtown after his
marriage, he earned a livelihood as a saddler, ironmonger, and
local postmaster. That Robert Dale Owen ever saw his paternal
grandparents is doubtful; that they exercised no influence upon
his life is certain.
5
If most of Owen's forebears have sunk into obscurity, the
fame of his father has increased with the passing of the years.
Robert Owen, factory reformer, educational theorist, and Uto-
pian socialist, was born in Newtown in 1771. As the sixth child
he received only a meager schooling and before his tenth year
set out for London to make his fortune. After spending some
time as an apprentice, he moved to Manchester, a city then
caught in the first flush of prosperity and opportunity created
by the Industrial Revolution. Yielding to the spirit of the times,
he set up on borrowed capital as an independent producer of
cotton thread. Success followed success; and in 1799 he not

but that fact is given undue emphasis in her son's autobiogra-
phy.3 As a young lady she was cheerful, gregarious, and self-
reliant, not afraid to give her hand to an utter agnostic. As a
parent she was loving and tender, and the devotion that she
inspired is evident in the few surviving letters that young Owen
wrote before her death.4 Ann Caroline never interfered with
the public career of her husband, though in the last years it
led to virtual separation. Nor did she hinder her four sons
from seeking their happiness in the New World across the
sea.
It is unlikely that there was any noble blood in the Owen
strain. The boy's paternal grandmother came from a family of
fairly prosperous farmers of Newtown, Montgorrieryshire. Her
husband, Robert Owen the elder, was born of poor parents at
Welsh Pool in the same county. Settling in Newtown after his
marriage, he earned a livelihood as a saddler, ironmonger, and
local postmaster. That Robert Dale Owen ever saw his paternal
grandparents is doubtful; that they exercised no influence upon
his life is certain.5
If most of Owen's forebears have sunk into obscurity, the
fame of his father has increased with the passing of the years.
Robert Owen, factory reformer, educational theorist, and Uto-
pian socialist, was born in Newtown in r77r. As the sixth child
he received only a meager schooling and before his tenth year
set out for London to make his fortune. After spending some
time as an apprentice, he moved to Manchester, a city then
caught in the first flush of prosperity and opportunity created
by the Industrial Revolution. Yielding to the spirit of the times,
he set up on borrowed capital as an independent producer of
cotton thread. Success followed success; and in r799 he not

succession by William, Ann, Jane Dale, David Dale; Richard,
and Mary. The first two chapters of Threading My Way de-

The curious will find the pages delightful reading, but they tell
more of Owen the septuagenarian than of Owen the child. The
biographer must look elsewhere if he is to analyze the forces
that really shaped the character of his subject.
As a youth Owen was influenced by the refined, aristocratic,
and semi-isolated life on a country estate. Mention of other
children is conspicuously absent from his memoirs; elsewhere
he admitted that he seldom associated with them. Depending on
private tutors for his rudimentary education, he grew to ado-

that pervaded Owen's home. In the Scriptures he read his

successful manufacturer who had given the world conclusive
proof that large profits under the new industrial order comported

famous for his activities in providing better education for poor
children, for his agitation for improved conditions of work in
the nation's factories, for his attacks on religious intolerance,

suppression of intemperance was another favorite reform; it

was not until his twelfth year that the younger Owen saw a man

One illustration of the father's influence was the son's re-

did not interfere with the sectarian instruction given his chil-

In fact, it was not until 181,7 that
he publicly scored all religions as false in character and in-
jurious in effect. Some five years earlier precocious Robert
had sought to convert his unbelieving sire. The result was un-
expected. For the first time the youthful Calvinist heard of
the Mahometans with their rival Bible and Savior and learned
that the multifarious Protestant sects constituted but a twelfth
of the world's religious bodies. Not unnaturally the pulled
lad was impressed by his father's inquiry, "Are you quite sure
that the one is right and the eleven wrong?" For a year longer
the proselytist struggled to retain his own faith; but in the end,
unable to understand why an omnipotent and benevolent deity
should create evil if men were to receive eternal damnation
for committing it, he sorrowfully abandoned his mother's creed.
Henceforth, until well into middle age, the younger Owen did
not believe in God.11
Before his twenty-fifth year Owen came to share many other
views with his father. He considered education to be moral as
well as mental instruction. Its principal purpose was to build
character, for he believed that character was determined largely
by one's early environment. The son also held that capitalism
had failed and that only the establishment of small, self-suffi-
cient villages with all property owned in common could cure
the depression of the worker under the new industrial economy.
Like his father, he regarded labor-saving machinery as a good
in itself but as a curse in a society founded on private owner-
ship of property. Both Owens rejected the dismal science of

THE ordered regularity of the years in which young Owen
grew to manhood was broken by several incidents of more than
passing interest. In his twelfth year a serious illness, during
which his life was despaired of, transformed a sturdy, athletic
boy into a physical and nervous weakling. Fifteen months
elapsed before his recovery was assured, and even then further
relief from the usual schoolboy's routine was deemed neces-
sary.

The next step in the growth of the reformer came with Owen's
departure for collegiate training" at Hofwyl. The schools of
Philip Emanuel von Fellenberg, located six miles from Berne,
Switzerland, were at that time among the most important
institutions of learning in Europe. Their founder, a member of
the Swiss patrician class and a friend of Pestalozzi, combined
with sound practice the best pedagogical theories of the French
Revolution. Assuming that extremes of wealth would always
exist, Fellenberg tried to teach rich and poor according to their
respective needs but in close proximity to each other. An essen-
tial was that both groups receive instruction in agriculture and
mechanics. Through this dual yet separate system Fellenberg
hoped that the poor would learn to respect the rich and the
latter, to appreciate the dignity of manual labor. The increase
of trade schools throughout the world was a goal to which he
aspired.

reformers in England. The disgraceful state of British schools
made any new system significant, but it was Fellenberg's use
of industrial and agricultural instruction that aroused greatest
interest. Here was a practical alternative to the inexpensive
Lancasterian method which depended upon advanced students
acting as monitors for the beginners. If the poor could pay the
cost of their training while obtaining it, a new era of education
might dawn in England. In 1816 Dr. Andrew Bell and Henry
Brougham inspected Hofwyl; a year later at New Lanark
Charles Pictet, an ardent supporter of the system, persuaded
Robert Owen to visit Fellenberg on his forthcoming Continental
tour/' In December 1818 The Edinburgh Review declared that

father to esteem education as the most effective means of uplift-

ideas from what he saw in Switzerland. There he witnessed an
enlightened attempt to meet the challenge of the Industrial
Revolution. There he studied pedagogical theory in practice
and was converted to Pestalozzian methods. There he came to
value a broad curriculum that embraced history, science, mod-

Irving's frank discussion of matrimony. He won the friend-
ship of two Americans;
the painter Chester Harding, then at
work on a portrait of Robert Owen, and the novelist John Neal,
who was writing for Blackwood's?1
But it was a dinner at
Jeremy Bentham's that marked the high spot of the London
visit. The great utilitarian had been impressed by Owen's little
book and invited him to an evening symposium. On those occa-
sions the guests sat at a table on a raised platform and were
encircled by a sort of trench three feet wide. In this trench,
with his head at the level of those seated, the seventy-eight-
year-old philosopher exercised for a half hour after the meal,
while pouring forth the wittiest and most eloquent invective
against kings and priests that Owen had ever heard. When the
group broke up at midnight, Bentham clasped the young man's
hand, saying in farewell, "God bless you, if there be such a
being; and at all events, my young friend, take care of your-

Despite its many interesting incidents, Owen's London jour-

helpful rather than essential to his growth as a reformer. In
1824 his father still sought social change through the enlight-

workers. A chasm still separated the New Lanark manufac-
turer and the radical political economists. There is no mention
of Francis Place, the Mills, or Richard Carlile in Owen's
journal. This silence is the more important because the British
birth control propaganda had already begun.

While the younger Owen had been growing to manhood, his
father had gradually sketched the outlines of a new economic
order. The genesis of his socialism may be traced to 1813
when he discussed the reformatory effects of proper environ-
mental conditions on the collective character of a group. In
1817 he proposed to abolish unemployment by settling from
500 to 1,500 of the idle in "Villages of Unity and Cooperation"
where material needs would be cared for through common labor
and debased lives remolded. These self-supporting units for
character building were to be established and directed by some
benevolent agency, whether it be an individual, a county, or
the national government. In 1820 he again advanced this
scheme, not as a temporary panacea but as a specific alternative
to the existing social order. Capitalism, Robert Owen declared,
had failed to provide "employment at wages sufficient to sup-
port the family of a working man beneficially for the com-
munity" and must be replaced by another system based "on
the principle of united labour . . .

After 1820 the elder Owen took steps to give his theory of
socialism a practical trial. By 1822 his plan was endorsed by
several philanthropic societies, and $250,000 were subscribed
to begin an experiment. In the next year he carried the gospel

to London in March 1824 was to raise a loan for a socialistic
enterprise, presumably at Motherwell, near Glasgow.

Some
preliminary arrangements had already been made by the fol-
lowing summer when the arrival of Richard Flower at Brax-
field turned the manufacturer's attention to the New World.
Across the Atlantic several religious communities employing
common labor were already in operation."
6
The most success-
ful was that of the Rappites, a sectarian society located at
Harmony, Indiana, on the east bank of the Wabash some fifty
miles above its mouth. Composed of sturdy Wiirttemberg peas-
ants who, fleeing to America early in the century to escape a
tyrannical orthodoxy at home, had adopted celibacy and com-
mon ownership of property, this group had twice hewn thriving
settlements out of the wilderness. Several factors explained
their prosperity in Indiana. The linen, woolen, cotton, and
leather goods fashioned in their workshops, together with the
whiskey from their distilleries, found a ready sale in a region
far removed from Eastern markets. Some produce was supplied
to new settlers, but the greater part was conveniently and
profitably sent by flatboat to New Orleans. Perfect social rela-
tions prevailed among people possessed of a common religious
tie. Strong leadership was provided by the society's founder,
George Rapp; and business ability was contributed by his
adopted son, Frederick.
27
Why the Rappites left Indiana to
begin a third home in Pennsylvania has never been satisfacto-
rily explained. It is possible that too much success, which threat-
ened primitive communal life and labor, rather than too little
was the cause,

to London in March r824 was to raise a loan for a socialistic
enterprise, presumably at Motherwell, near Glasgow.:ir. Some
preliminary arrangements had already been made by the fol-
lowing summer when the arrival of Richard Flower at Brax-
field turned the manufacturer's attention to the New World.
Across the Atlantic several religious communities employing
common labor were already in operation.~0 The most success-
ful was that of the Rappites, a sectarian society located at
Harmony, Indiana, on the east bank of the Wabash some fifty
miles above its mouth. Composed of sturdy Wiirttemberg peas-
ants who, fleeing to America early in the century to escape a
tyrannical orthodoxy at home, had adopted celibacy and com-
mon ownership of property, this group had twice hewn thriving
settlements out of the wilderness. Several factors explained
their prosperity in Indiana. The linen, woolen, cotton, and
leather goods fashioned in their workshops, together with the
whiskey from their distilleries, found a ready sale in a region
far removed from Eastern markets. Some produce was supplied
to new settlers, but the greater part was conveniently and
profitably sent by flatboat to New Orleans. Perfect social rela-
tions prevailed among people possessed of a common religious
tie. Strong leadership was provided by the society's founder,
George Rapp; and business ability was contributed by his
adopted son, Frederick.27 Why the Rappites left Indiana to
begin a third home in Pennsylvania has never been satisfacto-
rily explained. It is possible that too much success, which threat-
ened primitive communal life and labor, rather than too little
was the cause.28 However that may be, the decision to move

Nothing came of this proposal, and Owen had to wait im-

happily, by a business trip to Holland, at which time he studied
the Dutch attempt at Fredericksoord to end pauperism through
cooperative labor colonies.

Early in August 1825 Robert Owen returned to Braxfield,
bringing a glowing account of his work in America. He had
achieved far more than he had expected.
37
He had been cordially
received by President-elect Adams, Calhoun, and De Witt Clin-
ton. The people at large seemed favorably disposed. In Janu-
ary he had agreed to purchase Rapp's property. The next
month distinguished audiences crowded the House of Repre-
sentatives at Washington to hear him lecture. He had then
announced that his experiment would begin in April and that
the village, renamed New Harmony, would be the half-way
house in which his followers might prepare themselves for
life in the communistic colonies that would be formed on its
outlying lands.
38
Final negotiations were soon completed, and
with the departure of the last of the Rappites the undertaking
was formally commenced on April 27. By June more than eight
hundred persons had flocked to the Wabash, although the
founder had estimated that three years would be required to
gather so many. Faced with such encouraging prospects, even
William Owen, theretofore scornful of the backwoods where the
poor were content to live on hog and hominy and where the rich
did nothing but drink, speculate, and talk politics, was cheered.

THE modern traveler, whose luxurious floating palace breasts
the turbulent Atlantic in four days, can scarcely appreciate
the monotony, inconvenience, and perils encountered by his
great-great-grandfather on the best packets of an earlier day.
Life on shipboard seemed to many tourists of that period like
being in prison with the chance of being drowned. A later
passenger of the New York, crossing at the same season as
Owen, complained:
At best, a sea voyage is a confinement at once irksome and odious,
in which the unfortunate prisoner is compelled for weeks or months,
to breathe the tainted atmosphere of a close and crowded cabin, and
to sleep at night in a sort of a box, about the size of a coffin. . . .
At worst, it involves a complication of the most nauseous evils that
can afflict humanity, an utter prostration of power, both bodily
and mental, a revulsion of the whole corporeal machinery, accom-
panied by a host of detestable diagnostics, which at once convert a
well-dressed and well-favoured gentleman, into an object of contempt
to himself, and disgust to those around him.1
Owen's enthusiasm was not dampened by the annoyances of
an ocean voyage. His shipmates were a jovial lot; and the
presence on board of the operatic troupe of the elder Garcia,
then on its way to win the plaudits of New York, afforded many
evenings of delightful music. The spirit of adventure that
gripped the Owens and their two prospective communal com-

vividly expressed in an ode written by the latter and set to

the city. To this fanfare the annual November elections added
their political turmoil. Yet, despite these competing events,
the arrival of the Owens attracted much attention. The news-

Robert Owen was launching communism on the Indiana fron-

of homesteads on the public domain were making it easier and
cheaper for the discontented of the East to begin life anew as
individual landowners in the West. The New Harmony experi-

reform spirit were in evidence. Universal manhood suffrage
had not yet been established in New York, and the beginning
of the modern labor movement was still two years distant.
The advent of Unitarianism and Universalism indicated a grow-

the freedom to think and act beyond the bounds of all faiths
had yet to be won. In 1825 Susan B. Anthony was only five

ing liberalism within the confines of organized religion, but
the freedom to think and act beyond the bounds of all faiths
had yet to be won. In 182 5 Susan B. Anthony was only five
years old, Garrison had not yet established Tlte Liberator, and
Dorothea Dix was to teach school in Boston for another decade.
Fifteen years remained before Fourierism, as expounded by
Albert Brisbane, was to start America on its most important
quest for a communal Utopia. The brief and insignificant influ-

solve a problem that did not yet exist upon American soil.
Hostility to Owenism did not stem solely from economic
theory or nativism. The outspoken agnosticism of the leader
and the prevalence of similar views among his followers shocked
the orthodox. The Welshman failed to heed the conservatism
of American religion, and even his friends regretted that he
refused to keep his opinions to himself.

As a result, the public
journals eagerly pounced upon a dismal report, given by a sup-
posed itinerant Baptist minister, of the confusion and decay
in the old Rappite village. The Owenites, it was said, had
abolished all sermons, converted the town church into a dance
hall, and were teaching the doctrines of Tom Paine in their
schools.

copied even in Indiana, continued during the life of the com-
munity and went far to mold adverse sentiment throughout the
nation.

This unfortunate publicity was partially counteracted by the
decision of William Maclure to associate himself with the social
experiment. Born in Scotland sixty-two years before but an
American citizen for over twenty, Maclure was well-known as

he had been in New Lanark in September 1824, just prior to
Robert Owen's first departure for America; but apparently
his mind was not made up until a year later, during which
time he was urged to join the enterprise by his close friend,
Madame Marie Fretageot, by philanthropic Philadelphians,
and perhaps by Owen himself.
10
Maclure, however, refused to
invest in the project a sum equal to Owen's, declined to be re-
sponsible for any money already expended, and limited his
liability to $10,000. He donated books and instruments to the
experiment and later bought land for himself; but his chief
contribution was to gather on the Indiana frontier a group of
scientists and educators whose presence gave New Harmony,
both during the experiment and after, much of its intellectual
significance.
11
Foremost among this talented group was Thomas Say, already
famous as the leading descriptive entomologist in the United
States. Gerard Troost and Charles A. Lesueur, like Maclure,
were foreign born and, like Say, were distinguished members
of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. Troost
ranged over geology, mineralogy, chemistry, and other subjects;
Lesueur, in addition to his skill as a painter and draftsman,
had collected fossils and shells for the first study of the fish
of the Great Lakes. With these scientists Maclure brought two
Pestalozzian teachers, Marie D. Fretageot and William Phique-
pal D'Arusmont, both born abroad and both accompanied by
pupils from the schools that they were then conducting in
Philadelphia under Maclure's auspices. Also in the party were

was the chief topic of conversation. Near by, the final arrange-

Finding the season too ad-
vanced for regular steamboat service, the party hired the
keelboat Philanthropist; and on December 8 the long drift
down the Ohio began. For a month, however, ice interrupted
near Beaver the progress of this so-called "Boatload of Knowl-
edge." As the temperature rose the vessel moved again, float-
ing slowly past the famous river towns, then in their infancy,
Steubenville, Wheeling, Marietta, Cincinnati, and Louisville.
In spite of his intellectual and sociable fellow travelers Owen
chafed at the numerous delays. His father had gone ahead by
stage, arriving at his settlement on January 12. Not until
eleven days later did the Philanthropist reach Mt. Vernon, the
Ohio port for New Harmony. Even then some proposed to
continue to their destination by water, a matter of another
ten days. With the promised land only fifteen miles away,
Owen refused to listen to such a plan. That very evening he
borrowed a horse and hastened through the darkness to obtain
his first taste of community life.

to the Wabash. The traveler approaching from Mt. Vernon
received his first glimpse of its setting from the brow of a semi-
circular range of hills that rose some sixty feet above the valley,
a half mile south of the village. To the east stretched a large
tract of recently cleared meadow land, encompassed in part by
undulating hills and in part by the silent forest. To the north,
beyond another clearing, likewise sown with corn, wheat, and
small grain, flowed the river, behind which rose in unbroken
array the luxuriant and lofty woodlands of the Illinois bank.
To the west and south of the village the plain was lined with
orchards, while the slopes of the surrounding hills contained
fifteen acres of carefully cultivated vineyards.
As the traveler descended from his coign of vantage and
followed the road along the plain, signs of industry met his eye.
A brickyard, a tanyard, and a ropewalk paralleled his path.
To the right appeared a cotton factory and a steam mill. To
the left, screened by the trees that lined the banks of a branch
of the Wabash, stood a three-story flour mill. The unpaved
streets of the village, delightfully shaded by locusts and maples,
met at right angles. The junction of the Mt. Vernon roacl
running north and south with the Princeton road running east
and west marked the center of the town and there, in the north-
west quarter, stood the most impressive building, the residence
raised in the wilderness by the faithful for Father Rapp.
Across the street to the south was a steepled frame church,
and a scant ten feet from its door was a brick cruciform struc-
ture, already rechristened New Harmony Hall and dedicated
to the discussions and amusements of the new social system.
Scattered about without fixed design were six large brick build-
ings, many frame dwellings, numerous log cabins, and such
economic necessities as granaries, warehouses, machine shops,
a brewery, a dye house, and manufactories for soap, shoes, and
candles. Such was the physical setting for the communal life

for the leaders, probably more than half came from west of

Owen found the economic status of the community anything

the profitable Rappite manufactures to a standstill. Only
those trades dependent on individual initiative flourished. In
the agricultural department the alleged neglect of the departing
Harmony Society, insufficient sowing, and a general lack of
cooperation led to a food shortage as early as September.
Vegetables were then being purchased, and it was predicted

all his property in a common fund, and great differences in
labor and living facilities had been tolerated in order to attract

As a member of the constituent committee the younger Owen
had his first oportunity to influence the course of the social
experiment. At once he drafted his own blueprint for Utopia,
but the frame of government ultimately adopted ignored his
suggestions on the vital points. His wise proposals for an easy
amendatory process and a six-month probationary period for
new members were rejected, and his opposition to a strong
executive board was overruled. On the other hand, the right
of all members to enjoy equal rank, food, clothing, and housing,
passed over by Owen in silence, was specifically asserted in the
final draft.

placed too much trust in paper constitutions. Firm leadership,
a consistent policy, and sociable feelings among the participants
were necessary for the success of the enterprise. Thus, although

Robert Owen twelve hundred acres of land two miles east of
New Harmony. There they founded Macluria, an independent

half filled; and the great majority of the children enrolled at the
society's most prosperous period came from the other New

The Education Society's troubled course was further aggra-

cooperative communities as an alternative to a decadent capi-

Under the younger Owen the Gazette went beyond a discus-

irrationality in society. Where the prospectus had stated that
the paper would not combat the errors and follies of mankind,
the new editor considered it his "duty to exhibit . . .

prejudice however popular which we see producing misery to
the world, or which we discover retarding the progress of science
or general improvement."

Under that mandate Owen urged
reforms in English grammar, medicine, and female costume. He
criticized a Hoosier governor for advocating internal improve-
ments instead of public schools. He openly questioned the
wisdom of Christianity and condemned both strict Sabbatarian-
ism and indissoluble marriage.

the freethinker was emerging, the man who asserted his right to
discuss openly all matters pertaining to human happiness, re-
ligion, morals, and sexual relationships not excepted. Like his
father, however, he had not yet learned the wisdom of keeping
such matters separate from the experiment in common property
and mutual labor.
The most difficult task falling to Owen as editor was to re-
port on the progress of the community. His predecessors had
never told their readers the complete story of the continual
dissension and change, and he experienced a similar embarrass-
ment as affairs at the end of 1826 approached a crisis. Nor was

failed, and for their benefit Robert Owen had agreed in October

blame for not deeding his estate unreservedly to all who an-
swered his call depends on one's conception of wise philan-
thropy. Certainly nothing in his previous speeches indicated
that Robert Owen was ready to place his land in common
ownership, although the precipitate abandonment of the semi-
capitalistic Preliminary Society was misleading.
At the very time father and son were insisting that socialism
was still in operation about New Harmony, a relapse to indi-
vidualism was under way. Ten of the so-called communities,
comprising at best a few families who had leased land jointly
and subscribed to vague principles, were formed by May; but
none survived until the next April. Meanwhile the general
store passed into the hands of speculators, the wage system was
introduced in the local mill, and village lots were sold to private
owners. Signboards advertising profit-making ventures ap-
peared. The manufacture of whiskey, prohibited by the com-
munity, commenced. In March 1827, and again a month later
a large number of families left the scene.

Finally, at the end
of April, this grim tragedy was followed by a farcical afterpiece
in the final break between Robert Owen and William Maclure.
The open clash between these two philanthropists arose from
financial difficulties fanned to white heat by mutual irritation
at the failure of the experiment. The first rift had appeared in
June 1826 when Maclure decided not to give further support to
the community. The breach was widened in August when the
elder Owen set up schools in opposition to the Education So-
ciety; it became irreparable when he threatened to violate that
organization's lease.

Warren, inventor and anarchist, long remained a pleasant
memory.
52
Perhaps Owen's autobiography gives a too highly
colored picture of his communal life; certainly it is not a
complete one. But his contemporary writings do reveal an
optimism and faith in progress that even the disastrous ex-
periment could not dampen.
53
He seems, moreover, to have
been a person of great promise; and one friend wrote of him,
"Robert Dale is now and will be a man of a supperior [sic]
mind. The more I am acquainted with him the more I am
convinced of his supperiority."
54
During his sixteen-month residence at New Harmony, Owen
learned several lessons that governed his subsequent attitude
toward the community system. The social experiment was in
one sense part of his education, a laboratory in which he saw
tested many ideas he had received from his father. Coopera-
tion in theory had promised material abundance with less
work; cooperation in practice had failed to supply even the
bare necessities of life. On paper, manual labor was a health-
ful employment to be engaged in by all; in fact, it prostrated
those not trained to it. Owen soon discovered that he was in
the latter class. In his first youthful enthusiasm he had volun-
teered to toil wherever another hand was needed, in tearing
down log cabins, sowing wheat, and cooking in the community
kitchen. But when physical exertion brought bodily ills and
culinary efforts drew caustic comments, he recognized the
virtues in a division of labor and turned to the more congenial
occupations of superintendent, teacher, and editor.
55
Others
experienced similar difficulties, and Owen came to believe that
a rational education was a necessary prerequisite to the com-
munity system. Man, he felt, must be taught from childhood
to work with his hands, to care for public property as if it were

was ever fond; and the weekly musicales conducted by Josiah
Warren, inventor and anarchist, long remained a pleasant
memory."2 Perhaps Owen's autobiography gives a too highly
colored picture of his communal life; certainly it is not a
complete one. But his contemporary writings do reveal an
optimism and faith in progress that even the disastrous ex-
periment could not dampen.53 He seems, moreover, to have
been a person of great promise; and one friend wrote of him,
"Robert Dale is now and will be a man of a supperior [sic]
mind. The more I am acquainted with him the more I am
convinced of his supperiority." 54
During his sixteen-month residence at New Harmony, Owen
learned several lessons that governed his subsequent attitude
toward the community system. The social experiment was in
one sense part of his education, a laboratory in which he saw
tested many ideas he had received from his father. Coopera-
tion in theory had promised material abundance with less
work; cooperation in practice had failed to supply even the
bare necessities of life. On paper, manual labor was a health-
ful employment to be engaged in by all; in fact, it prostrated
those not trained to it. Owen soon discovered that he was in
the latter class. In his first youthful enthusiasm he had volun-
teered to toil wherever another hand was needed, in tearing
down log cabins, sowing wheat, and cooking in the community
kitchen. But when physical exertion brought bodily ills and
culinary efforts drew caustic comments, he recognized the
virtues in a division of labor and turned to the more congenial
occupations of superintendent, teacher, and editor.55 Others
experienced similar difficulties, and Owen came to believe that
a rational education was a necessary prerequisite to the com-
munity system. Man, he felt, must be taught from childhood
to work with his hands, to care for public property as if it were

IN THE SPRING of 1827 the future of Robert Dale Owen hung
in the balance. With the social experiment at an end, two distinct
courses seemed open to him. He might remain at New Harmony
and, aided by his father's property, seek his fortune as an
individual landowner, helping at the same time to make his
residence a distinctive Western village. That was the course
chosen by his brother William. On the other hand, he might
return to Britain and, while pursuing a mercantile career, gratify
his desire to benefit mankind where the need for reform was
the greatest. That was the path taken by his father. That Owen
followed the example of neither grew out of his friendship for
America's pioneer feminist, Frances Wright.
Frances Wright's early life was in many respects similar to
Owen's. Born in Scotland in 1795, the daughter of a wealthy,
agnostic merchant and a colorless, orthodox mother, she re-
ceived a good private education amid liberal surroundings. She
early renounced revealed religion, published her first book be-
fore her twenty-third year, and was patronized, when left an
orphan, by such distinguished men as Lafayette and Bentham.
Like Owen, a trip to the United States at an impressionable age
changed the course of her entire life.

pleasure of non-participating masters, and without leaving a
large, free black population in that section. She intended to
set slaves, specially purchased or donated for the purpose, to
work under a system of cooperative labor and, after their eco-
nomical toil had created profits sufficient to extinguish the
original debt and pay the cost of future transportation, to
settle them in free Africa. To prepare the bondmen for liberty
a few philanthropic whites would reside with them on the
plantation.

Unlike the Owen enterprise, Frances Wright's Nashoba ex-
periment was conceived on a modest scale. When commenced
in February 1826 on a few hundred acres of unimproved wood-
land along the Wolf River, back of Memphis, it comprised only
eight slaves, even fewer whites, and represented an investment
of $10,000. Like New Harmony, however, this venture in
cooperation proved to be an economic failure, chiefly because
the participants were unprepared for the physical labor required.
Late in the spring the founder's health gave way, and operations
came to a virtual standstill. After a brief but futile vacation at
New Harmony, Miss Wright deeded her land and property to
ten trustees, one of whom was the younger Owen, to carry on
her plan of gradual emancipation.

been selected rather than William, whose acquaintance with

It was during Miss Wright's subsequent visit to New Har-
mony in February 1827 that the lives of the two reformers
were drawn closer. At that time Owen expressed editorially
a perfect agreement with her ideas on slavery. More significant
was his unreserved praise for her additional chapters of A Few
Days in Athens, which were then first published.
5
These chap-
ters contained a bitter attack on all religions and presented a
clearer statement of the agnostic position than Owen had yet
formulated. Such bold approval caused Frances Wright to tell
her admirer that he was one of the few persons with whom
she desired to work in the cause of reform. By April there was
nothing more Owen could do at New Harmony, and he was
ready to go to Nashoba to assist in forming a cooperative com-
munity for whites, provided for by the deed of trust.
6
Whatever hope Owen may have had for communal life in
Tennessee was quickly dispelled. On the voyage down the
Mississippi Miss Wright became so ill that she had to be carried
from Memphis to her settlement in a hammock. At Nashoba
Owen found only three whites, Frances' younger sister Camilla,
Richesson Whitbey, formerly of New Harmony, and James
Richardson, a Scottish physician. The physical setting was
anything but attractive. A clearing of a hundred acres of
second rate land, worked with indifferent success, three log
houses and as many cabins constituted the sole evidence of the
hand of man. The crudities of New Harmony were the height
of civilization compared with this wilderness.
7
The discouraging outlook at Nashoba compelled an imme-
diate change of plans. Not only were new members needed for
the cooperative experiment but Miss Wright's health required
a sea voyage and rest in a cooler climate. When Camilla found
it impossible to accompany her sister to Europe, Owen con-
sented to go. It is not unlikely that he had foreseen such a

He then crossed to England in a futile attempt to win recruits
for the Nashoba community. All the time, however, he was
irresistibly drawn to Braxfield to see again not only his mother
and sisters but also a fifteen-year-old girl whom he had loved
for about five years. Margaret, whose story as "Jessie" fills a
disproportionate space of Threading My Way, had first at-

with high talents and extraordinary beauty. By a curious chain
of circumstances in which the eldest son and the eldest daugh-
ter played important roles, Margaret became in March 1823 a
member of the Owen household and was henceforth treated as
one of the family. The young reformer lost his heart com-

truer affection than he was ever likely to hold again.

him that she was vain, frivolous, and not entirely sincere. His

Henry Pickersgill and met for the first time James Mill,
George Combe, and John G. Spurzheim. From Spurzheim he
obtained an enduring interest in phrenology. Incidentally, con-
temporary charts of Owen's head showed his organs of benevo-
lence, conscientiousness, and friendship highly developed, while
that of wit developed the least of all. During this same Lon-

several occasions. The warm friendship between the latter
and Frances Wright was shared by Owen, and in the autumn

he always enjoyed. Miss Wright had an equally high opinion
of her companion and was more than glad to have some
masculine support on which she could depend.

What this
relationship meant is perhaps best revealed in a letter to Owen
by Mary Shelley.
Take care of our Fanny, dear Dale [she said] she is neither so
independent or so fearless as you think. . . . You will say perhaps
that if she confide not in you, the secretiveness is hers not so
we must all be sure of sympathy before we confide at all. ... In-
spire a belief in your lively & active interest for her You are not
in love now one clay you will be again and the time may come
when in spite of all self-esteem you may fear that you are not loved
in return Now then practise yourself in such lessons as may
make you loveable, . . .
Nothing is better calculated to instil sweet-
ness of disposition & that best & most endearing of qualities
tenderness, than a constant attention to a woman, with whom you are
not in love, yet for whom you have affection and kindness ... we
all have in us ... a desire to find a manly spirit where on [to"|
lean a manly arm to protect and shelter us The time is perhaps
not far off when Fanny may find in a lover these necessities better
supplied than you can supply them but till then, no man need
be nearer, dearer, or more useful to her than yourself.

Owen apparently accepted the advice; for shortly afterwards
Frances could write, "Dale arrived, his sweet kind heart
all unthawed, and truly when he left us for Harmony I think
the very last thin flake of Scotch ice had melted from
him." lft

Take care of our Fanny, dear Dale - [she saidl she is neither so
independent or so fearless as you think.... You will say perhaps
that if she confide not in you, the secretiveness is hers - not so -
we must all be sure of sympathy before we confide at all. . . . In-
spire a belief in your lively & active interest for her - You are not
in love now - one day you will be again - and the time may come
when in spite of all self-esteem you may fear that you are not loved
in return -Now then practise yourself in such lessons as may
make you loveable. ... Nothing is better calculated to instil sweet-
ness of disposition & that best & most endearin~ of qualities -
tenderness, than a constant attention to a woman, with whom you are
not in love, yet for whom you have affection and kindness - . . . we
all have in us ... a desire to find a manly spirit where on [tol
lean - a manly arm to protect and shelter us - The time is perhaps
not far off when Fanny may find in a lover these necessities better
supplied than you can supply them - but till then, no man need
be nearer, dearer, or more useful to her than yoursclf.1r.
Owen apparently accepted the advice; for shortly afterwards
Frances could write, "Dale arrived, his sweet kind heart
all unthawed, and truly when he left us for Harmony I think
the very last thin flake of Scotch ice had melted from
him." rn

a fortnight before. There he found conditions even less prom-
ising than in the previous May. Economic failure was appar-
ent. One glance had been sufficient to assure Mrs. Trollope
that she had no desire to settle, as she had originally planned,
upon the desolate scene. Richardson's unexpected departure
had left Whitbey as the sole male white. The former's ill-
judged zeal in sending for publication in the Genius of Uni-
versal Emancipation evidence of his cohabitation with the slaves
had, moreover, given the experiment an unenviable reputation.

it is unlikely that he anticipated finding on his arrival that

In a long article written at sea while separated from Owen,
Miss Wright had again changed the purpose of her colony.
Believing that slavery was destined to die from economic
waste, she transformed Nashoba into a cooperative commu-
nity where whites and free blacks would live and work together
while their children were educated in common as equals. It
was her aim to raise the Negro to the level of the white, .thus
preparing the way for the eventual amalgamation of the races.
As if this bold proposal were not enough, the author attacked
at length the American prejudice against color and criticized
the existing concept of marriage. In short, Frances Wright
issued her Declaration of Moral Independence and dedicated
Nashoba as the place where her principles would be carried
into practice.

to issue an immediate disavowal for all trustees not then resi-

agreed with some points. The next manifesto to come out of

Upon orthodox religion this child of the eighteenth century

natural law. He asked why so vital a matter as the very ex-

conception of an omnipotent deity who permitted evil in the
world and then damned his creatures for committing it. He
scorned church ceremonies and denied the divine origin of the
Scriptures.

Owen's quarrel with orthodoxy, however, lay
not so much in its theory as in the evils created by its practice.
Its teachings, he pointed out, turned men's thoughts to a future
life and hindered reformers in their efforts to improve this.
Strict observance of the Sabbath deprived the workingmen
of normal sports and amusements, encouraging clandestine
drinking and gambling. Sectarianism invaded the schools,
blocked the advancement of science, and led to unjust dis-
crimination in courts of justice. In the Sabbatarian movement
Owen saw a violation of personal liberty; in the central reli-
gious organizations, a threat to the nation's freedom. Worst of
all was the activity of the clerical profession. In an age when
fear and force as motives to well-doing were being abandoned
in legal codes and education, they were retained by the minis-

in its main outlines. The sceptic neither affirmed nor denied
the existence of God. He lacked sufficient knowledge for belief
and did not feel obliged to seek further evidence. Freed from
concern with a future world, he could devote himself to re-
forming this. Where believers must spend their day of rest
worshipping things unseen and unknowable, non-believers could
study science and understand the universe about them. Owen
denied that scepticism was cold and heartless. He found
warmth and pleasure in doing good for its own sake, not for
a future reward. In complete mental emancipation he saw the
true value of his creed. To those hesitating before the Rubicon
that separated orthodoxy and heterodoxy he said, "I have
crossed in safety, and found the opposite shore fair and pleas-
ant; a land of freedom and virtue, whence terror is banished,
and where tranquillity reigns. He that is a bold swimmer, let
him fearlessly attempt the passage. ... He will become a
better, a wiser, and my experience for it a happier
man." 32
Unlike many liberals of his day, Owen did not consider free-
thought as synonymous with mere hostility to Christianity.
To him it meant the right to discuss openly all matters per-
taining to human happiness, and in this belief he wrote boldly
on woman's rights and marriage. He deplored the fashion that
confined a lady to a retired, idle existence in which she "must
not venture out under Nature's air and sun, lest her lily cheek
be tinged with the hue of health, or ... use her hands, be-
cause her taper fingers might lose their pretty form." 33
Owen
regarded woman as the social and mental equal of man and
urged her, through learning a trade or profession, to become
his economic equal. More important, he demanded repeatedly

Owen insisted that life-long affection could
not be assured by rites or statute. When love died, the law
might compel continued wedlock although it engendered dis-
cord and strife. Owen opposed such severity and favored
separation in all cases except those imperiling the education
of the children.34
Owen's advocacy at this time of birth control was more the
result of accident than design. By the autumn of 1828 he was
well aware of the British Neo-Malthusian literature and propa-

his father deny certain allegations made by Richard Carlile on
the subject. But the Indiana backwoods was no place to dis-

inexpediency. Soon afterwards a prospectus for Carlile's book

recently won urban hegemony. Its population, numbering
166,000 in 1825, passed the 200,000 mark five years later. Its
annual customs exceeded $13,000,000; and its sixteen incor-
porated banks and fifty-eight packet lines in foreign and
domestic service testified to its commercial importance. Ten
daily and twenty weekly newspapers were necessary to meet
the business and intellectual demands of this young giant.
Such a growth, to be sure, was not an unmixed blessing. Im-
migration brought foreign radicals with materialistic ideals
abhorrent to American orthodoxy. Manufactures developed an
underprivileged laboring class inconsistent with American de-
mocracy. Rapid expansion meant new urban problems of
housing, education, and moral correction. The severe winter of
18281829 had shown the intense suffering of the less fortunate
members of the community. The report of the Magdalen
Society in 1831 was to disturb profoundly the complacency of

the newly formed General Union for Promoting the Observance
of the Christian Sabbath. Sometimes independent of but
never in opposition to these orthodox auxiliaries were a growing
number of humanitarian associations designed to foster tem-
perance, peace, seaman's aid, and prison reform. Even such
secular concerns as antislavery, adult lyceums, and manual
training schools were largely controlled by men whose philan-
thropic zeal grew out of a deep religious sentiment. Between
the "New York Philanthropists/
7
, that pious interlocking direc-
torate in benevolence, and Robert Dale Owen there was a
deep gulf.
2
Aside from the unforgivable sin of heterodoxy,
Owen's views on private property were distrusted by the aristo-
cratic and middle class liberals, and their fears were not quieted
when he became a radical leader of the nascent labor movement.
There could be no cooperation between those who sought re-
form from above and Owen who, whatever may have been
his real opinions, talked of reform from below.
Owen arrived in New York without the publicity that had
greeted the sensational speeches of Frances Wright. He canie
not to lecture but to edit The Free Enquirer, a three-column

the newly formed General Union for Promoting the Observance
of the Christian Sabbath. Sometimes independent of but
never in opposition to these orthodox auxiliaries were a growing
number of humanitarian associations designed to foster tem-
perance, peace, seaman's aid, and prison reform. Even such
secular concerns as antislavery, adult lyceums, and manual
training schools were largely controlled by men whose philan-
thropic zeal grew out of a deep religious sentiment. Between
the "New York Philanthropists,". that pious interlocking direc-
torate in benevolence, and Robert Dale Owen there was a
deep gulf.2 Aside from the unforgivable sin of heterodoxy,
Owen's views on private property were distrusted by the aristo-
cratic and middle class liberals, and their fears were not quieted
when he became a radical leader of the nascent labor movement.
There could be no cooperation between those who sought re-
form from above and Owen who, whatever may have been
his real opinions, talked of reform from below.
Owen arrived in New York without the publicity that had
greeted the sensational speeches of Frances Wright. He came
not to lecture but to edit Tlze Free Enquirer, a three-column

style was striking but careless, and in controversy she betrayed
signs of dogmatism and egotism. Less effective than his friend
on the rostrum, Owen wrote in a careful, engaging manner,
with arguments well grounded in fact. His command of words
was excellent, and in the most heated discussion he was seldom
guilty of want of charity or good temper. As a freethought
controversialist Owen was preeminent, and his ability to write
persuasively stood him in good stead in later life.
During Frances Wright's prolonged absences Owen twice
received editorial assistance. The first came from Orestes
Augustus Brownson, later famous as a bold thinker on social
problems, a man who began life a Presbyterian and died a
Catholic after sampling Universalism, scepticism, Unitarianism,
transcendentalism, and other "isms" of his own making. In
the autumn of 1829 Brownson had left the Universalist church;
and seeking truth "under whatever name it may come," he
was persuaded by Miss Wright, then on her way to Haiti, to
become a corresponding editor from his home in Auburn. De-
spite Owen's warm welcome, Brownson's contribution proved
negligible, and within a few months he had begun his slow and
tortuous drift back to orthodoxy.

to diffuse knowledge through scientific instruction and public
speaking, in its dependence upon the talents of its own mem-
bers, and in the general character of its weekly program, Owen's
institution resembled the lyceum founded by Josiah Holbrook
in 1826. It differed, however, in its constant discussion of reli-
gion, or irreligion, its failure to campaign for common schools,
and its aloofness from the national organization formed in 1831.
It is probably true that lyceum members, in the larger cities
at least, were of a higher social stratum than the mechanics
attending the Hall of Science. The latter found its real coun-
terpart in similarly named halls that sprang up among the
British urban workers in the late thirties.
12
In one important respect the meetings at the Hall of Science
differed from those of the other freethought groups in New
York. Despite an elaborate program of activity, no formal
order or association was ever constituted. There was no Hall
of Science Society, no Hall of Science Party. Then, as through-
out his life, Owen opposed organized reform. He realized that
more influence could be wielded by such groups but only at the
cost of individual thought and action. Some years before Ralph
Waldo Emerson resolved a similar problem with regard to anti-
slavery, Owen wrote, "For practical experiments . . . men
must unite; but there ought to be no association to support
opinions"
13
Besides his duties as freethought lecturer, book publisher,
and conductor of a weekly gazette, Owen was kept busy in
New York, as we shall see, as a labor agitator and chief editor
of a daily newspaper. These activities, requiring twelve hours
of sedentary work each day, seriously threatened his health.

adopted a vegetarian diet, abstaining from coffee, tea, and

ascetic one.

The nature and intensity of Owen's work appears to have
left him little time for recreation or new friends. Frances
Wright's radicalism had estranged her well-to-do hosts of 1818,
and Owen had nothing in common at this time with such later
associates as William Cullen Bryant or John Worth Edmonds.
His chief companions were those interested in his reforms,
humble mechanics and obscure liberals. The most notable were
Kneeland, later victim of a blasphemy trial in Boston, George
Henry Evans, future champion of free land, Gilbert Vale, sub-
sequently biographer of Paine and editor of The Beacon, and
Dr. John Baxter, lecturer in the New York School of Medicine.
Before July 1830 the East River home was pleasantly filled by
the Wright sisters, D'Arusmont, Jennings, and such distin-
guished visitors as Robert Owen, fresh from his debate with
Alexander Campbell, Josiah Warren, in search of a new
Utopia, and David Dale Owen, in quest of a life occupation.
After that date, however, Owen was left alone with Dale,
who took up painting and drawing; and it was in that period
that he blamed his illness on "a hermit's life . . . not very con-

friendship meant intellectual stimulus and practical advice on

One significant aspect of Owen's activity in New York was

he tried to reply on the spot to a sermon.

After a time, how-
ever, Owen found his orthodox opponents both too numerous
and too abusive to please him. The least distinguished he
wisely ignored;
ls
but with some he engaged in prolonged con-
tests and these last are worthy of passing notice.
To the charge of atheistic bigotry advanced by Menzies Ray-
ner, Universalist editor of the Hartford Religious Enquirer,
Owen returned the plea of not guilty. The accusation, however,
had a wholesome influence in forcing The Free Enquirer to pro-
vide its readers with some of the standard orthodox rebuttals
to agnosticism. From William Gibbons, prominent Hicksite doc-
tor of Wilmington and president of the Delaware Temperance
Society came an abusive pamphlet "exposing" Owen's plan to
establish anarchy in the land and to substitute for matrimony
"a licensed promiscuous concubinage." In refuting these gar-
bled extracts from his own writings, the reformer was compelled
to cross swords with Benjamin Ferris, another but better natured
Hicksite Friend and historian of colonial Delaware. The re-
sulting letters to Ferris contain the best succinct statement
of Owen's views on God, revelation, marriage, and morals. In
1831 the Scotchman had to go over the same ground to con-
vince Thomas Whittemore, noted author and preacher, that the
articles printed in his Trumpet and Universalist Magazine by
Linus S. Everett entitled "The Rise and Progress of Infidelity
in America" were misleading and erroneous. The final detailed
exposition of Owen's freethought doctrines came in a long de-
bate, not always amicable in nature, in the columns of his

he tried to reply on the spot to a sermon.17 After a time, how-
ever, Owen found his orthodox opponents both too numerous
and too abusive to please him. The least distinguished he
wisely ignored; 18 but with some he engaged in prolonged con-
tests and these last are worthy of passing notice.
To the charge of atheistic bigotry advanced by Menzies Ray-
ner, Universalist editor of the Hartford Religious Enquirer,
Owen returned the plea of not guilty. The accusation, however,
had a wholesome influence in forcing The Free Enquirer to pro-
vide its readers with some of the standard orthodox rebuttals
to agnosticism. From William Gibbons, prominent Hicksite doc-
tor of Wilmington and president of the Delaware Temperance
Society came an abusive pamphlet "exposing" Owen's plan to
establish anarchy in the land and to substitute for matrimony
"a licensed promiscuous concubinage." In refuting these gar-
bled extracts from his own writings, the reformer was compelled
to cross swords with Benjamin Ferris, another but better natured
Hick.site Friend and historian of colonial Delaware. The re-
sulting letters to Ferris contain the best succinct statement
of Owen's views on God, revelation, marriage, and morals. In
r83r the Scotchman had to go over the same ground to con-
vince Thomas Whittemore, noted author and preacher, that the
articles printed in his Trumpet and Universalist Magazine by
Linus S. Everett entitled "The Rise and Progress of Infidelity
in America" were misleading and erroneous. The final detailed
exposition of Owen's freethought doctrines came in a long de-
bate, not always amicable in nature, in the columns of his

proposal to provide each citizen reaching his majority with an
equal amount of land, the latter had sought proof for his belief
that Owen's sympathy for labor was false. In July 1830 he
felt he had discovered such evidence, first in Owen's sugges-
tion that parents pay a small head tax on each child sent to the
new state boarding schools which he wished to introduce and
second in his admission, during a journalistic discussion of the
population question, that the wage-earner would do well to limit
the size of his family.

At once Skidmore publicly denounced
the suggested limitation as an insult to the poor and the tax as

Owen had scarcely corrected the agrarian's misstatements
when a more complete publicity was given his earlier praise of
Carlile. An anonymous abusive pamphlet printed in full the
original article in The New Harmony Gazette, called the writer
a disciple of Malthus, and accused Robert Owen of introducing
contraceptive information into England. It agreed that the son
was hostile to the workingman and dared him either to endorse
or to repudiate the doctrines of Richard Carlile. Although this
tract was inspired by Skidmore, its author was probably George

The weapon thus forged by Owen's fellow reformers was
quickly seized by his enemies. In July 1830, he had imprudently
forwarded to the New York Typographical Society, with whom
he had had trouble before, a specimen of typography just re-
ceived from England. When the members met to consider the
acceptance of the gift, one of them read extracts from Every
Woman's Book and stated that the donor approved its con-
tents. The shocked gathering at once decided to reject the
present and gave as a reason, in a letter not then published,
the fact that Owen was a scoffer, a foreigner, and a moral in-
cendiary, intent on establishing free intercourse between the
sexes. 'Somewhat taken aback by this intemperate reply, Owen
unwisely recounted the main facts of the case in his paper and
repeated his qualified approbation of Carlile's work. At once
the Typographical Society published its statement in the Com-
mercial Advertiser, the editor of which refused to print
with it a minority report protesting against the action thus
taken.

Owen was now thoroughly aroused. He believed that his
alleged endorsement of Carlile was being used by the aristo-
cratic, clerical party solely to injure the cause of freethought,
and he felt it keenly that the handle should have been given by
another reformer. Honest prejudices entertained by society
may have kept him from meeting the challenge of the anony-
mous pamphleteer, but further silence would imply his approval
of both Malthus and Carlile. In short, he felt "baited" into
his subsequent course of action.

Early in October he began a
series of three articles making out the economic and sociological
case for Neo-Malthusianism. In the last of these he announced

the forthcoming publication of a tract that would treat the
physiological aspect of the subject. After some delay there
appeared on the first day of December 1830 a seventy-two page
pamphlet bearing the author's full name and entitled Moral
Physiology; or, a Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population
Question?*
The introductory pages of the treatise explained the reasons
for its publication. The author then plunged at once into the
heart of his subject, the instinct of reproduction. This he de-
fended as both a means of propagation and a source of pleasure.
Upon inquiry he concluded that control of the instinct was pos-
sible and desirable, but he did not regard such control as a
panacea for the world's ills. Denying that Europe or the United
States suffered from overpopulation, Owen rested his case upon
the part that contraceptive knowledge would play in improving
the quality of the human race, strengthening the marriage tie,
and elevating the position of women. Society would benefit
from the decrease of celibacy among adults and a decline in
prostitution. The poor, relieved of the economic pressure re-
sulting from large families, would be able to give their children
a better education.

On turning from the theory of birth control to the practice,
Owen showed little concern for objections based on chastity
or natural rights. The former he defined in the words of
Franklin as "the regulated and strictly temperate satisfaction,
without injury to others, of those desires which are natural to
all healthy adult beings."

because they ran counter to human nature in asking individuals
to give up their best years to avert an evil they might not
live to see.
31
After sixty pages of such arguments as might well
have appeared in The Free Enquirer, the author in seven more
briefly described three methods of contraception, two of which
he abandoned in six months. He noted the advantages and
disadvantages of each as to effectiveness and pleasure and in-
vited his readers to communicate to him privately their ex-
perience with these checks. He concluded with a few remarks
on the dissemination of this information in England by men of
irreproachable character.
32
Owen had foreseen the violent criticism to which he would
be exposed by this bold but decently written tract. Upon com-
pleting the manuscript, he read the whole in the privacy of his
room and then decided, against the advice of all his friends,
to give it to the printer. He openly declared, "I desire no repu-
tation that is inconsistent with the authorship of this work. I
hold it to be a good work. ... So long as the world is not
prepared to approve its honesty, I can do without the world's
approbation."
33
The reception, however, was extremely grati-
fying. Fifteen hundred copies were sold in five months, and a
fifth edition was issued on August 13, 1831. This circulation
was attained in spite of the limited number of papers in which
the treatise could be advertised. The Free Enquirer spoke of
it constantly, and the Boston Investigator may have done like-
wise. The New Harmony Disseminator listed it among other
standard liberal imprints, but there public notice in America
seems to have ended.34
Fortunately much could be done by

ing. In the fourth edition (N. Y., May 28, 1831), the second and third methods
were relegated to a footnote and were later omitted altogether.

because they ran counter to human nature in asking individuals
to give up their best years to avert an evil they might not
live to see.31 After sixty pages of such arguments as might well
have appeared in The Free Enquirer, the author in seven more
briefly described three methods of contraception, two of which
he abandoned in six months. He noted the advantages and
disadvantages of each as to effectiveness and pleasure and in-
vited his readers to communicate to him privately their ex-
perience with these checks. He concluded with a few remarks
on the dissemination of this information in England by men of
irreproachable character.32
Owen had foreseen the violent criticism to which he would
be exposed by this bold but decently written tract. Upon com-
pleting the manuscript, he read the whole in the privacy of his
room and then decided, against the advice of all his friends,
to give it to the printer. He openly declared, "I desire no repu-
tation that is inconsistent with the authorship of this work. I
hold it to be a good work. . . . So long as the world is not
prepared to approve its honesty, I can do without the world's
approbation." 33 The reception, however, was extremely grati-
fying. Fifteen hundred copies were sold in five months, and a
fifth edition was issued on August 13, 1831. This circulation
was attained in spite of the limited number of papers in which
the treatise could be advertised. The Free Enquirer spoke of
it constantly, and the Boston Investigator may have done like-
wise. The New Harmony Disseminator listed it among other
standard liberal imprints, but there public notice in America
seems to have ended.34 Fortunately much could be done by
"'Moral Physiology, 19, 26-28.

withdrawal previous to emission; use by the female in the vagina of a damp
sponge with a ribbon attached; use by the male of a "baudruchc" or skin cover-
ing. In the fourth edition (N. Y., May 28, x831), the second and third methods
were relegated to a footnote and were later omitted altogether.

workingman who did not own real estate was entitled to a
decent existence by society. Although class discrimination lay
at the root of labor's grievances, its program of reform appealed
beyond the landless mechanic to every liberal who placed the
rights of person before the rights of property. For Robert Dale

urged the formation of an independent labor party, was broken
on October 19 by a gathering of radical workingmen in the
Wooster Street Military Hall.3
The Committee of Fifty's report
and the resolutions there adopted hotly denounced paper money,
banks, monopolies, and the tax exemption of ecclesiastical
property. The existing distress was attributed to the unequal
distribution of land; and it was incautiously suggested that
there could be no true reform "until a revolution takes place,
such as shall leave behind it no trace of that government which
has denied to every human being an equal amount of property."
Although the meeting had a good word for republican education
and agreed with Owen that the wage-earner should be repre-

less by the doctrines of The Free Enquirer than by Thomas
Skidmore and his recently published book, The Rights of Man

the radical resolutions attacking private property and the clergy
went forth under Owen's signature and were promptly attrib-

the latent danger of associating his heterodoxy with a political
party, Owen promptly published a letter disclaiming all re-

of the London Times a careful
distinction between his program and that of Skidmore.6
The
canard, moreover, was effective. Never again did Robert Dale
Owen act publicly as a member of the new Working Men's
Party.
Disappointed but not discouraged by the incident, Owen
sought another way to aid labor's cause. Through the Associa-
tion for the Protection of Industry and for the Promotion of
National Education, formed by Frances Wright the previous
month and officered by the leaders of the Hall of Science, he
began to demand free boarding school instruction for the chil-
dren of the workers. Three nights before the legislative election,
the same evening the Committee of Fifty was meeting elsewhere,
the Association assembled in Military Hall and endorsed un-
reservedly this educational scheme called state guardianship.

in an attempt to present a united front against Tammany. As
soon as, almost before, that group had adjourned, Owen's fol-
lowers gained control of the hall and adopted the same radical
resolutions passed in Wooster Street. This capture of the old

"New York Correspondence" of the London Times a careful
distinction between his program and that of Skidmore.6 The
canard, moreover, was effective. Never again q.id Robert Dale
Owen act publicly as a member of the new Working Men's
Party.
Disappointed but not discouraged by the incident, Owen
sought another way to aid labor's cause. Through the Associa-
tion for the Protection of Industry and for the Promotion of
National Education, formed by Frances Wright the previous
month and officered by the leaders of the Hall of Science, he
began to demand free boarding school instruction for the chil-
dren of the workers. Three nights before the legislative election,
the same evening the Committee of Fifty was meeting elsewhere,
the Association assembled in Military Hall and endorsed un-
reservedly this educational scheme called state guardianship.7

ing repaired to Masonic Hall, where dissatisfied Democrats and
remnants of the disorganized Adams-Clay faction had gathered

Despite this last minute excitement the three-day November
election began quietly. On the first day the Democratic organ
was more concerned with a split in its own ranks than with the
"workies," and that evening a conservative paper declared that
the canvass "seems to excite less interest than almost any pre-
ceding one we remember." 9
On the next day Tammany re-
sorted to a ruse. Under the pretense that the "Infidel Ticket,"
opposed to the rights of property and headed by Wright, Owen
and Jennings was sweeping all before it, its editor implored the
people to vote for any respectable party. A political ally took
up the cry of alarm and sagely hinted that the best way to de-
feat Fanny Wright was to unite behind the regular Democrats.
This panic-stricken pose was maintained on the third day.
10
The result was a complete Democratic triumph over the other
parties. The surprise, however, came in the election of a
Working Men's candidate to one of the eleven Assembly seats
and an average poll by his colleagues of six out of twenty-one
thousand votes.
11
The emergence of the workingmen as a real force in New
York City politics delighted Owen but did not satisfy him.
Almost at once he began to discuss the steps necessary to insure
complete success.
12
Certain shortcomings, such as weak nomina-
tions and injudicious resolutions, were beyond his control. His
own heterodoxy and association with the New Harmony experi-
ment, responsible for much of the post-election abuse showered
upon the new party, he felt the mechanics must endure; for
they had many agnostics in their ranks.
13
Thus at a meeting on
December 29 the laborers followed Owen in officially repudiating
Skidmore's agrarianism, and during the next month they seemed
willing to pursue a policy of complete toleration.

were first, to establish a press
that could organize, rally, and defend the wage-earner, and
second, to devise a simple, popular program on which all work-
ers could unite. To the solution of these problems Owen turned
his indomitable enthusiasm and unflagging industry.
Unlike their Philadelphia brethren, the New York working-
men had no newspaper of their own until the very eve of the
November election. In the preceding months The Free En-
quirer, true to its liberal principles, had stood in the breach,
reporting meetings and printing significant documents.15
Its
notorious heterodoxy and the comparatively small space it could
devote to politics, however, made necessary a journal devoted
solely to the interests of labor. Such a one was The Working
Man's Advocate which appeared on October 31. Its editor,
George Henry Evans, later famous as a land reformer and at
this time a close friend of Owen, had agreed to place republican
education before agrarian equality. Although he did valiant
work, Evans' efforts did not answer the need. As a weekly,
his paper could hardly cope with the host of Jackson and Clay
dailies; as a foreign-born agnostic, he, like Owen, exposed the
party to the charge of atheism and encouraged the plea of
nativism.

The establishment of a daily labor organ was hastened by
the party's strong showing in the legislative election. First

Following the lead of the more original Frances Wright, he
began during the summer of 1829 to sketch a system of board-
ing schools open without charge to all the children of the state.
By November his agitation had become incessant, and he had
formulated a creed, delightful in its vagueness.
I believe [it read] in a National System of Equal, Republican,
Protective, Practical Education, the sole regenerator of a profligate
age, and the only redeemer of our suffering country from the equal
curses of chilling poverty and corrupting riche, of gnawing want
and destroying debauchery, of blind ignorance and of unprincipled
intrigue.
By this, my creed, I will live. By my consistency, or inconsistency

Feeling that the issue of reublican education had not been
presented clearly to the voters in the legislative election, Owen
repeatedly urged the new party to place it at the head of its
demands. He did not wish the workingmen to strive for too
many things at once but rather concentrate on the measure
which he believed "would do more to reform the abuses that
pervade this country than any other."

Early
in April 1830, with but slight foreshadowing, there appeared
anonymously in the Sentinel his six essays on "Public Edu-
cation."
In a republican system of education as conceived by Robert
Dale Owen the state would become the guardian of all its chil-
dren. It would provide them with equal food, clothing, and
instruction and lodge them in boarding schools maintained at
public expense. The existing regime of day schools was deemed
unsatisfactory because the pupils spent their idle hours in en-
vironments that varied according to the wealth of their parents.
Equality was to be the keynote of the new order, and nowhere
more so than in the curriculum. Each student was to receive
instruction not only in reading, writing, and arithmetic but also
in history, modern languages, chemistry, drawing, and music.
In addition, each was to be trained in agriculture and one useful
trade so that he could, if necessary, earn a living with his hands.
This combination of literary and manual education, it was
hoped, would inculcate in all alike an appreciation of the dignity
of labor and thus go far to eliminate the stratification of Ameri-
can society.
28
Despite its bold departure from American scholastic tradi-
tion, Owen's scheme of republican education met with consider-
able favor. Such a reception was all the more surprising since
the author expected to pay for the costly boarding schools, not
through the products of the pupils but by taxation, a method
nowhere widely accepted. Nevertheless the six essays were
copied in full into sixteen papers, were approved by many more,

For more than a month no important criticism seems to have
been made in liberal circles. Yet, in the end, these essays paved
the way for a disastrous schism within the ranks of labor, a
schism that shattered all hopes to ameliorate the condition of
the industrial worker through political action.
Partisan considerations in the last analysis lay behind this
fatal division. Ever since the November election had revealed
the potentialities of the recently enfranchised wage-earner,
members of the inchoate conservative groups had flocked to
the labor standard, hoping to build upon its democratic base
an effective opposition to the dominant Jackson forces. As

voted another ticket eight weeks before.

order to condemn as irregular the proceedings at the North
American Hotel. The blame for the split was placed upon
Owen and Skidmore who were accused of seeking to reverse
the supposed repudiation of their leadership by the party the
previous December. Guardianship was denounced as a re-
vival of the New Harmony community system; and since its
advocates secretly desired to subvert all civil and social insti-
tutions, they were spurned as unworthy of political fellowship.
One week later the Sentinel faction assembled and reaffirmed
the usual labor principles, including the right of private prop-
erty and religious freedom. Although state boarding schools
were not specifically demanded, a tax-supported educational
system was insisted upon. This group attributed the discord
to politicians who sought to control the party for the benefit
of the conservative, anti-Jackson element.40
The political results of the labor schism were first revealed
in the Fifth Ward aldermanic election, held early in July. Only
three men took the field, one supported by the Democrats, one
by the Sentinel wing of the Working Men's Party, and one by
a coalition of the Evening Journal faction and the old Adams-
Clay forces. In an exciting canvass, featured by a repetition
of Tammany's electoral ruse and an abusive handbill against
the community system, the coalition candidate was victorious.

bitter than it was important. Owen played the role of a party
leader, summoning his cohorts to the polls through the columns
of both his papers. The outcome was an overwhelming victory
for the Democrats, who secured 10,000 votes. The best that
Owen's group could average was 2,000, whereas the coalition
of conservatives and adherents of the Evening Journal obtained
7,000. It was evident that new party lines in New York City
had been drawn, and that an independent labor organization
could play but a negligible role. The Sentinel wing of the
workingmen fought on until 1834, but with their merger in
that year with the Democrats the movement turned from

EDUCATION FOR THE WORKERS 99
In the summer of 1829 Robert Dale Owen had urged the
mechanics of New York to seek equality of citizenship with
their recently won ballot. Slightly more than a year later, as
a result of divergent ideologies and tactical blunders, that
venture lay wrecked on the shoals of dissension. In the guber-
natorial election neither Tammany nor the coalition manifested
fear of Fanny Wright, Bobby Owen, or agrarianism. On the
contrary, the former inveighed against Anti-Masonry, while
the latter's goal was the ousting of the Regency.
46
But though
it no longer appeared as a threat to party stability, the Working
Men's proved to be a liberalizing force. For all his public
utterances that the mechanics would of themselves effect re-

EDUCATION FOR THE WORKERS 99
In the summer of 1829 Robert Dale Owen had urged the
mechanics of New York to seek equality of citizenship with
their recently won ballot. Slightly more than a year later, as
a result of divergent ideologies and tactical blunders, that
venture lay wrecked on the shoals of dissension. In the guber-
natorial election neither Tammany nor the coalition manifested
fear of Fanny Wright, Bobby Owen, or agrarianism. On the
contrary, the former inveighed against Anti-Masonry, while
the latter's goal was the ousting of the Regency.46 But though
it no longer appeared as a threat to party stability, the Working
Men's proved to be a liberalizing force. For all his public
utterances that the mechanics would of themselves effect re-
forms, Owen hoped for no more. From the labor movement, he
told Trist, he expected indirect results in the form of changes
that ordinary men in public life would ignore if not urged upon
them by popular demand. Some progress of that sort was evi-
dent in the early thirties. In New York a mediocre lien law
was enacted, imprisonment for debt abolished, and the onerous
militia duties modified. Private contributions to school societies
increased, and it may well be that the triumph of tax-supported

LATE in October 1831, before a Hall of Science crowded to
capacity, Owen gave a "farewell address" on the influence of
the clerical profession. In repeating his earlier strictures on the
priesthood and predicting that those agents of orthodoxy would
not long survive, he spoke with a moderation and want of ani-
mosity seldom before in evidence. After redelivering the lecture
in Tammany Hall and again in Wilmington, the reformer
boarded the Albany steamboat on November 10 and began
the first leg of a long delayed journey to New Harmony.

More than a year before, Owen had known that private busi-
ness would compel a visit to Indiana. The large estate left by
Robert Owen to the management of his eldest sons had not been
successfully developed and was barely meeting expenses. In
getting clear of his entanglements with Taylor, Fauntleroy and
Company, William Owen had drawn upon the financial assist-
ance of the Wright sisters, and his brother felt obliged to look
after his associate's interests.

For his own part, in severing
editorial and business connections with the Sentinel a few
months before, Owen had suffered along with Frances Wright
a loss of some $3,000. Although he still retained "a bare com-
petence," he felt the need of obtaining a larger annual income
from his Western property.

Owen was still too much of a propagandist to proceed directly

freethought he made frequent stops as he passed through New

vestigator. At Ithaca Owen met for the first time Orestes
Brownson, already well along on his return to orthodoxy. Lec-

of The Free Enquirer himself would, within a year, abandon

he disliked, it was evident that the home on the banks of the

At such a time his thoughts reverted to the family
circle across the sea. To his mother he revealed his most inward,

throws upon his character but also for the joy it brought to a
maternal heart soon to be stilled forever. After referring to
his prominence in New York politics and to the turbulent life of
a reformer, he continued,
All this is very foreign to my character, which always was, & still is,
a quiet, domestic almost indolent one. Did I not believe that my
presence here is useful, & that it gives impetus to the cause of practical
democracy & education, I wd. willingly exchange the bustle for the
quiet of retirement. ... I have, I think, neither so much ambition

In his loneliness Owen spoke also of Margaret in whose wel-
fare he still took a deep interest. He admitted that he had
loved her more tenderly, perhaps, than he might ever love an-
other and that even now he had only conquered his feelings,
not lost them. But at a distance he could judge her character
dispassionately, and he had no desire to marry her.
12
His father,
however, misinterpreted these reflections and late in 1830 made
some proposal apparently looking forward to the marriage of
his eldest son with the daughter of a mill hand. For such dis-
interestedness Owen was duly thankful; but with a logic that
even the great socialist could not fail to comprehend, he replied,
My own feelings speak even more strongly than you do, in her
[Margaret's] favor; but my judgment demurs. ... I fear very
much fear she is not perfectly sincere. You will say, how could
she be so? But if she is not so, it matters not that we can easily ex-
plain how that trait in her character was formed. I cannot trust my
happiness for life in the hands of one in whose sincerity I have not
perfect confidence. The venture is too great.
Turning to the less "fastidious" William who had also been
attached to Margaret, Owen continued, "I believe he cd. be
satisfied & happy with her. ... He does not, like me, look for
all but perfection in a woman. He has not seen, I know, as much
of female intellect as I. His standard is fixed far lower; & per-

the latter was one of the few women to hear all of Frances

in those days to arouse his approval and admiration. At a time
when he was subsisting on milk and water, bread and biscuit,
rice and barley, she adopted a vegetarian diet. At a time when
he was preaching that women before marriage should become
financially independent, she was mastering, to the amusement
of her family, a trade. Perhaps it was her bold endorsement of
Moral Physiology that caught Owen's fancy most.

it was her character and intellect that Owen appreciated, for

Henry D. Rogers, later distinguished as a geologist, sailed for
London on the packet-ship Hudson. Rogers, who had recently
resigned a professorship at sectarian Dickinson College and
was then contributing to The Free Enquirer, was only one of
the excellent company that made the slow and stormy crossing
speed by for the happy Owen.

The reformer studied naviga-
tion, wrote for his paper, and argued interminably on politics
and religion with a high Tory, Anglican minister. At Ports-
mouth he left the party and hurried on to London by land. To
one accustomed to the bad roads and endless forests of the
American West, the macadamized turnpikes and carefully
trimmed landscape of the island kingdom proved a welcome
sight. But it was the temper of the nation rather than its beauty
that caught Owen's attention. The great Reform Bill had just
passed, and the quiet loyalty and orthodoxy that he remembered
from his last visit were replaced by excitement and bold in-

Many changes had taken place in the Owen family circle
since Robert's brief visit to Scotland five years before. Mar-
garet had married. In 1829 his father had severed connections
with the New Lanark mills, and shortly afterward Braxfield was
given up. Mother and daughters lived for a while at Allen
Bank, Hamilton, while the elder Owen centered his activity in
London. In October 1830 Ann, who had been partly responsible
for bringing Margaret into the household, had passed away;
and in the spring Mrs. Owen followed her to the grave. Upon
his arrival in England, Owen learned that Mary, his youngest
sister, had also died. Jane, the sole surviving daughter, was
teaching at the new Association of the Industrious Classes,

Henry D. Rogers, later distinguished as a geologist, sailed for
London on the packet-ship Hudson. Rogers, who had recently
resigned a professorship at sectarian Dickinson College and
was then contributing to The Free Enquirer, was only one of
the excellent company that made the slow and stormy crossing
speed by for the happy Owen.24 The reformer studied naviga-
tion, wrote for his paper, and argued interminably on politics
and religion with a high Tory, Anglican minister. At Ports-
mouth he left the party and hurried on to London by land. To
one accustomed to the bad roads and endless forests of the
American West, the macadamized turnpikes and carefully
trimmed landscape of the island kingdom proved a welcome
sight. But it was the temper of the nation rather than its beauty
that caught Owen's attention. The great Reform Bill had just
passed, and the quiet loyalty and orthodoxy that he remembered
from his last visit were replaced by excitement and bold in-
quiry. The calmness with which people discussed the possibil-
ity of a revolution made the American think that Europe was
soon to be the "New World" and afforded further basis for his
optimistic faith in human progress so eloquently expressed

the urban laborers. For Robert Owen at sixty-one was still
engrossed in the amelioration of the human race. He had re-

chief interest was a labor exchange to which workers could
bring their products and receive credit for other goods in pro-

London is at its prettiest in June, and the young newlyweds
spent a delightful month there before continuing to France to
join the D'Arusmonts. It was Mary's first visit to England and
sightseeing was the order of the day'. Comments on the National
Gallery, the British Museum, and the theaters and parks filled
her letters to Amos Gilbert. Her husband, on the other hand,
wrote on current events. He visited Carlile in prison, lectured
before his father's society, and participated in its debates.
Then, late in July, the original party, except for Jane in the
place of Rogers, crossed the Channel by way of Guernsey,
Jersey, and St. Malo. France, too, presented a pleasing picture
to the friends of liberalism; and seeing the early stirrings of
the nation under its bourgeois king, Owen prophesied the
speedy establishment of a republic.

At Passy, outside of Paris, Owen found Frances Wright living
happily with her husband and daughter. The travelers passed
an enjoyable few weeks in that quiet retreat, and it was there
that the two reformers finally decided to give up the journalistic
enterprise begun four years earlier in The New Harmony
Gazette. Behind that decision was the fundamental fact that
the interests of each lay elsewhere. Camilla's death, a long
illness, and the birth of her baby had for some months past
completely silenced Frances' voice and pen; and D'Arusmont's
opposition made it appear at the time that they would never
be heard again. The founder of Nashoba had herself written

Owen
also felt that his previous exertions entitled him to devote his
attention to personal matters. Marriage had increased his finan-
cial responsibilities and he could no longer spend his time ex-
clusively in the non-remunerative business of reform. The value
of his New Harmony property would depend largely on the
supervision he gave to it. Perhaps, too, he was averse to ex-
posing Mary to the torrent of abuse that was the lot of a free-
thought editor. Two years before, he had told his mother that
whenever he thought he could be spared from the struggle, he
would leave it. Now, he informed his subscribers in a let-
ter dated August 17, that time had come. The main object
of the paper, the establishment of a press free to discuss
every topic pertaining to human happiness, had been achieved;
and since others could continue the work thus begun, the
original conductors felt at liberty to retire to private
life.

In taking this abrupt and unexpected leave of his readers,
Owen divulged his future plans. With the assistance of his
oldest brother he hoped to make New Harmony an attractive
Western village and a center of American liberalism. Private
property, not communism, would prevail; but the inhabitants
might cooperate to form schools, reading rooms, and public
lecture courses. Owen stated further that Madame D'Arusmont
would move with her family to Indiana in the following spring
and that the East River home would be reestablished on the
Wabash. For the present Mary was to remain at Passy to ob-
tain the cultural benefits of a winter in France; while he
returned to America, as he was pledged to do, to settle the
business affairs of himself and others.

Fortunately for Owen's peace of mind;
chance nullified this
proposed separation from his bride. Despite pressure from
his father to assist in the labor exchange venture and a tempt-
ing opportunity to disseminate his freethought writings among
the English workers, Owen embarked dutifully but sadly at
Gravesend early in October. Twice, however, the boat was
forced back by Channel storms; and then, contrary to all
assurances, the captain sailed while Owen had gone to London
on an errand. As that was the last vessel that could reach
America before ice had closed the Ohio, the reformer joyfully
agreed to abandon his transatlantic crossing.
31
The incident
is not without interest, for Owen's letters written at the time
reveal that he was not debating with himself the mere question
of remaining abroad a few months. He was thinking of making
England the scene of his life's work. New Harmony, he argued,
offered a more independent and adventurous career, one in
which success rested solely upon his own efforts. London
afforded more intellectual stimulus, more opportunity to en-
gage in humanitarian enterprises, and a more healthful climate
in which to raise a family. In spite of his recently obtained
citizenship and in spite of Mary's known preference for
America, Owen could not decide whether he wished the winds
to blow him across the sea or delay him. He felt that if he
remained in London that winter, he would never settle per-
manently in the United States.
32

her husband, and together they lived at Robert Owen's home .

Owen, however, was busy
enough with his other duties. Like the Hall of Science, the
Association held regular lectures and debates, as well as social
functions. For a time the Owen family monopolized the ros-
trum. The father usually spoke Sunday evenings on topics of
current interest; but when he was spreading his gospel else-
where, the eldest son served as substitute. Dale, who had
abandoned art for chemistry, commenced with Henry Rogers
a series of popular lectures on scientific subjects; and Robert
followed with others on physical geography. With some mem-
bers of the Association the latter formed a Social Missionary
and Tract Society and became its president. With others he
established a National Political Council which circulated his
anonymous tract, The Anatomy of Taxation?'3
Owen's heaviest work came in the conduct of The Crisis,
a weekly reform journal begun the previous April. Before he
assumed control in November, its contents had been confined
chiefly to reports of meetings and Robert Owen's writings with
very little original matter or comment on current developments.
Under its new pilot The Crisis quickly showed marked im-
provement. The brilliant, short editorial piece, sparkling with
epigrammatical phrases and bristling with provocative points,
was introduced. For more than five months Owen wrote every
one of those articles, touching on such varied matters as the
progress of the labor exchange, the course of liberalism in
France, and the success of manhood suffrage in America.30

Despite this
eleventh-hour hesitation Owen continued to emphasize the
necessity for some limitation on population; and his oft-re-

gave an important impetus to Neo-Malthusianism in England.
The London winter proved to be a pleasant interlude rather
than a vital influence in Owen's life. In the spring he resumed
his interrupted journey to America and did not cross the Atlan-
tic again for twenty years. The chief result of his visit was the
exalted place he obtained among British secular leaders. For
the first and last time the Owens, father and son, were actively
associated as equals in reform labors ;
and in the next generation
men like Holyoake and Bradlaugh held their names, for a time,
in equal esteem. Owen seems to have been his father's favorite,
and the latter cherished fond hopes that in the future his eldest
son would return to England to carry on the work.43
Robert
had won, too, the admiration of many Owenites, and his subse-
quent career in America received much publicity in English
freethought circles. The tracts of the New York period were
reprinted more frequently abroad than at home and gained for
him the title of the best early writer on cooperation.
44
Less
aware than their American brethren of the growing conserva-
tism of Owen's middle years, British secularists were deeply
shocked by his later religious views, and the cry of apostasy
was as loud on one side of the Atlantic as on the other.
On April 19 Owen and his party left London and a few
days later boarded the Hannibal at Portsmouth for a stormy
voyage to New York.45
Six months in England had not made
him wish, as he had feared, to live there permanently. Although

reprinted more frequently abroad than at home and gained for
him the title of the best early writer on cooperation.44 Less
aware than their American brethren of the growing conserva~
tism of Owen's middle years, British secularists were deeply
shocked by his later religious views, and the cry of apostasy
was as loud on one side of the Atlantic as on the other.
On April r9 Owen and his party left London and a few
days later boarded the Hannibal at Portsmouth for a stormy
voyage to New York.45 Six months in England had not made
him wish, as he had feared, to live there permanently. Although

from his own extraordinary versatility and adaptability and
partly from a deep-seated tolerance that permitted him to ignore
surface shortcomings and reach the basic, sterling qualities of
human kind. Even in the first few busy weeks while he made
preparations for his wife's arrival, Owen showed a willingness
to meet his future townsmen more than half way. The decision
of the D'Arusmonts to remain in France had put a temporary
end to his plans for erecting a new home, and he set about to
convert an old Rappite dwelling on the eastern edge of the
village. He would have preferred to live, like Richard, on the
ridge of hills to the south; but business required a location
nearer the town. Owen's spirits ran high as he praised Har-

work done promptly in the backwoods, and related how one
farmer had sold him a crib because he had thought that the
newcomer was the man most likely to need such an article.

One unpleasant problem remained to be solved before Owen
could settle down to his rustic life. That was a $11,000 debt
owed by William and himself to Frances Wright and for the
collection of which D'Arusmont had come to New Harmony.
Most of this obligation, perhaps all, had been incurred when
William in 1830 finally got rid of all ties binding him to the
Taylor-Fauntleroy fiasco.

To give D'Arusmont sufficient secu-
rity the brothers proposed to mortgage some of the land just
received from their father; but at the last moment they dis-
covered that, since it was held in trust, such a procedure was
not possible. Both Robert and William were reluctant to en-
cumber their own property; and it was only after the French-
man had threatened to place the matter in the hands of a
lawyer that another agreement was reached. This settlement,
involving the payment of eight per cent interest for fifteen years,
led, however, to strained relations; and when Frances Wright
returned to America in 1835 she did not visit New Harmony.

until late in his public career. Not the least source of his satis-
faction was the development of his wife from a timid, un-
worldly girl to an independent, thoughtful woman, capable of
acting in emergencies and sensibly advising her more experi-
enced husband. While in New York, with Robert a thousand
miles away, Jane fell a victim to the cholera epidemic; and
although already with child, Mary nursed her sister-in-law
through a grave, delirious illness.

fear because she felt they were so just.

When, however, the
husband saw that his wife felt she loved more than slie was
loved, he became remorseful. In an important letter given to
self-analysis Owen admitted that he had always set too much
store on the exterior qualities of grace, manner, and beauty.
He begged his bride to remember that, if they were not per-

Thus early did Owen describe his own character. Through-
out his life he sought the company of fashionable yet intellec-
tual women, and protracted absences from home on state affairs
made it impossible for him and Mary to repeat the intimacy of
these first years. But a strong love based on mutual esteem
and need never ceased. In all the bitter, unfounded personal
attacks made during Owen's long public service, there was no
mention of unfaithfulness to his wife.
10
What Robert wrote
to Mary in July 1833 continued to be true until that hot August
day, thirty-eight years later, when high on Maple Hill behind
the village they had both loved so well, he conducted the funeral
ceremony of his own beloved wife "I owe whatever man can
render to woman: & that debt of love, so life remain to us,
shall be paid."
n
In The Free Enquirer Owen had theorized on the duties and
obligations of parents. Now that he was faced with the actual
problems, he conscientiously applied his earlier writings to
practice. To Trist he reflected,
Are we not bound, when we are about to give birth to sentient crea-
tures, who, but for our voluntary act, wd. never have been called
into existence, to consult their future happiness in preference to our
own? ... If there be any moral obligation, any natural responsi-
bility in the world, it is, in my view, the obligation of the giver of
life to make that life, to the full extent of his ability, happy. It seems
to me highly immoral to confer life, except with such a resolution.12
Some two months after reaching New Harmony, Mary gave
birth to a large, handsome girl who was chri&taied Florence
Dale. The rational husband had insisted on a f$ame at once
cultivated, euphonious, and uncommon. The, jjroung couple
quickly instituted a Spartan regime of light clotfes, frequent
exercise, and daily baths. A more elaborate program based upon

VILLAGE LIFE IN THE WEST 127
Thus early did Owen describe his own character. Through-
out his life he sought the company of fashionable yet intellec-
tual women, and protracted absences from home on state affairs
made it impossible for him and Mary to repeat the intimacy of
these first years. But a strong love based on mutual esteem
and need never ceased. In all the bitter, unfounded personal
attacks made during Owen's long public service, there was no
mention of unfaithfulness to his wife.10 What Robert wrote
to Mary in July 1833 continued to be true until that hot August
day, thirty-eight years later, when high on Maple Hill behind
the village they had both loved so well, he conducted the funeral
ceremony of his own beloved wife - "I owe whatever man can
render to woman: & that debt of love, so life remain to us,
shall be paid." 11
In The Free Enquirer Owen had theorized on the duties and
obligations of parents. Now that he was faced with the actual
problems, he conscientiously applied his earlier writings to
practice. To Trist he reflected,
Are we not bound, when we are about to give birth to sentient crea-
tures, who, but for our voluntary act, wd. never have been called
into existence, to consult their future happiness in preference to our
own? ... If there t>e any moral obligation, any natural responsi-
bility in the world, it is, in my view, the obligation of the giver of
life to make that life, to the full extent of his ability, happy. It seems
to me highly immoral to confer life, except with such a resolution.12
Some two months after reaching New Harmony, Mary gave
birth to a large, handsome girl who was chris~ened Florence
Dale. The rational husband had insisted on a1
;xiame at once
cultivated, euphonious, and uncommon. The)young couple
quickly instituted a Spartan regime of light clat1tes, frequent
exercise, and daily baths. A more elaborate program based upon
1°Four years after his wife's death a story of Owen's faithlessness appeared,
but it was immediately denied by his daughter. Cincinnati Commercial, July r4,

fallacious.

Robert Owen's educational theories was mapped out for sub-
sequent years. At four months the child seemed perfect in
health and conduct, "a fat, laughing, healthy chubby faced in-
fant, with large bright blue eyes, what phrenologists call a
mathematical forehead . . . and as lively as a cricket: in
short just such a marvellous child as all first children are to
their parents.'

In the summer of 1834, however, the baby
was stricken and died before completing her first year. Of the
grief felt by the agnostic parents nothing is known, for Owen
made no mention of it in his letters of that date which survive.
But in the Maple Hill cemetery today the curious will find a
flat, weather-worn, stone slab on which is inscribed:
Ephemera all die at sunset; and no insect of this class ever sported
in the rays of the rising sun. Happier are ye, little Human ephemera!
Ye play only in the ascending beams and in the early dawn ;
and in
the eastern light, ye drink only the first sweet draughts of life; hover
for a little space over a world of freshness and blossoms, and then
fall asleep in innocence ere ever the morning dews are exhaled.14
One delightful feature of Owen's life in New Harmony was
the extraordinarily close relations existing between the brothers
and sisters and their families. It is not improbable that during
1833 and 1834 Jane and Dale lived with the newlyweds; and
the former, free until her marriage from the household chores
that burdened the less sophisticated and talented Mary, co-
operated with Owen in various literary and recreational under-
takings.

Of the brothers William was then, as always, closest

mercial affairs, but the tradition that he was the best business
man of the four is not well founded. All were equally bad.

The most ambitious of all of Owen's educational schemes
was the stillborn New Harmony Manual Labor College. That
type of institution was being regarded with more and more favor
by liberals of all shades, and as early as August 1834 Owen
sought the assistance of William Maclure. Despite grandiose
dreams of making Thomas Cooper president, he won the sup-
port of the sceptical younger Maclure. In February the state
legislature approved a charter for the college; and in the next
summer Owen, soon to be elected president, addressed a printed
circular to his former followers in the East appealing for finan-
cial aid. Although the advantages of an industrial and agri-
cultural training in a healthful, inexpensive residential village,
boasting of two libraries and a chemical laboratory, were
glowingly set forth, the public response was feeble. The Owen
brothers had offered to bestow upon the college property worth
$5,000 as soon as a contingent fund of $10,000 had been sub-
scribed, but not a tenth of that sum was ever raised.

hostility did not impede donations, for most of the near-by
papers noticed the scheme favorably. Rather the enterprise
was conceived on too vast a scale. In the Western country day
schools were difficult to organize; and there was no demand

Owen's project suffered also from a lack of the cohesive religious
spirit that was so instrumental in founding schools in the wil-
derness ;
in fact it was quickly set down as an abode of infidel-
ity. By 1836 its sponsor was already losing interest; and in
the end, the net result of his agitation was to draw a few
liberals to the Wabash and attract the attention of others who
hoped that a new communal experiment might be commenced
there.

In its failure to establish decent schools, elementary, second-
ary, or collegiate, New Harmony was neither better nor worse
than the majority of its neighbors. But aside from the mutual
instruction society, it did boast of two other undertakings not
then common in other Hoosier villages of similar size. One
was the weekly Disseminator which, when it was revived in
June 1834, was the only periodical in Posey, Vanderburg, or
Gibson counties. The cultural significance of the newspaper in
the days before the cheap magazines, the cinema, and the radio
should not be underestimated. Equally important was the re-
newed activity of the Thespian Society, founded in 1828. En-
thusiasm for amateur dramatics ran high in 1834, and a climax
was reached early the next year as a contemporary letter
indicates.
The whole town [wrote one citizen] is agog in getting up the play
of William Tell. R. D. Owen is as much Interested in it as if the
fate of the Republic depended on it and everything is ransacted to

and all are to take part. Rehearsal has been taking place at the Hall
& at R. D. Owen's House for nearly a month past altho the Play is

VILLAGE LIFE IN THE WEST r33
In its failure to establish decent schools, elementary, second-
ary, or collegiate, New Harmony was neither better nor worse
than the majority of its neighbors. But aside from the mutual
instruction society, it did boast of two other undertakings not
then common in other Hoosier villages of similar size. One
was the weekly Disseminator which, when it was revived in
June 1834, was the only periodical in Posey, Vanderburg, or
Gibson counties. The cultural significance of the newspaper in
the days before the cheap magazines, the cinema, and the radio
should not be underestimated. Equally important was the re-
newed activity of the Thespian Society, founded in 1828. En-
thusiasm for amateur dramatics ran high in 1834, and a climax
was reached early the next year as a contemporary letter
indicates.
The whole town [wrote one citizenJ is agog in getting up the play
of William Tell. R. D. Owen is as much Interested in it as if the
fate of the Republic depended on it and everything is ransacted to
find the proper costumes of by gone days. Mrs. Owen, Jane & William
and all are to take part. Rehearsal has been taking place at the Hall
& at R. D. Owen's House for nearly a month past altho the Play is
not to be acted till 2 8 feby. . . . Mr. Leseur [sicJ has been engaged
and is still in Painting some new Scenery for the occasion. . . . The
people from far & near are coming. . . . The president of the Bank
at Evansville ... & the Cashier who is a musical man is to take
part. ... They are trying to get Mr. Neef into the orcastra....25
Heralded by flattering notices in neighboring towns, the
piece made such a success that it had to be repeated a month
later. Thereafter theatricals which were frowned upon as im-
moral in most Western communities became a regular part of
New Harmony's social life, and the excellence of the perform-
ances was commented upon by travelers.26

tentionally he kept his pen busy; for, as he told Trist, during
"some years past I have spent so much time in writing for the
press that to have a literary undertaking in hand has become
almost a habit with me. It is a habit which I see not the use
of breaking myself of. . . ."
27
Thus after 1832 he contem-
plated several projects: a biography of Galileo, a romance
centered about Bartolome de las Casas, the Apostle of the In-
dies, a simple essay on manners, and a more elaborate work on
American national traits and political institutions.
28
Unfortunately the topic he finally settled upon was much
less happy than any of the foregoing. An excellent prose writer,
gifted with a fund of anecdote, Owen might well have expanded
the letters he had written for The Free Enquirer while on his
travels in 1831 and 1832 into a valuable picture of America in
the age of the common man. He had shown himself to be a
shrewd observer in citing incessant attention to "party politics
and prices current" as a distinctive American characteristic.
He had not confused civility with a want of servility, and he
had manifested a friendly appreciation of the independent quali-
ties of the Western backwoodsmen.29
To describe such a people
would have been worth while. But by wandering into the field
of poetry for the purpose of portraying Indian character and
illustrating the possibilities in historical dramaturgy, Owen
succeeded in writing a tragedy which, after obtaining a brief
notice in its day, has long since been relegated to obscurity.
In choosing the theme of Pocahontas, Owen's motives were
didactic, and he proceeded along scholarly lines. Therein lies
the drama's greatest fault as literature. So strict was his his-
torical accuracy that he created only two imaginary characters,
both of secondary importance. Every principal event in the

the theme had been bothered by the fact that the natural climax,
the rescue of Smith by Powhatan's daughter, came early in the
story. In Pocahontas, or the Settlers of Virginia (1830) George
W. Custis had abandoned all chronology and had made the
deliverance the finale of his drama. James N. Barker's Indian

the New Harmony Jockey Club. The Owen brothers derived
jointly income from rentals on their father's estate and together
they embarked on various speculative and commercial enter-
prises. One of these was a $6,000 investment in Josiah War-

Upon his return to New Harmony in 1833 Owen hoped that a
few years hence would see him financially independent. The
general prosperity that preceded the speculation and subsequent
panic of 1837 gave substance to these hopes. The rising price
of produce had by 1833 almost doubled land values in four
years, and this rise was sustained after a brief decline in 1834.
Trade on the Wabash became heavier, and the younger Maclure
wrote that people were not only getting out of debt but also
showing a disposition to buy land.
44
Expectations stirred by
these signs were raised further when it became evident that a
state-wide system of canals, railways, and good roads was to
be constructed. Owen was not oblivious of the growing senti-
ment for internal improvements. In the spring of 1835 he began
to purchase lots at Evansville, where property was to increase
in value four hundred per cent in eighteen months, thereby
giving the Owen brothers a $7,500 profit over a three-year
period. Hoping for a similar boom at Mt. Vernon, Owen con-
tinued to speculate extensively.

years, and this rise was sustained after a brief decline in 1834.
Trade on the Wabash became heavier, and the younger Maclure
wrote that people were not only getting out of debt but also
showing a disposition to buy land.44 Expectations stirred by
these signs were raised further when it became evident that a
state-wide system of canals, railways, and good roads was to
be constructed. Owen was not oblivious of the growing senti-
ment for internal improvements. In the spring of 1835 he began
to purchase lots at Evansville, where property was to increase
in value four hundred per cent in eighteen months, thereby
giving the Owen brothers a $1,500 profit over a three-year
period. Hoping for a similar boom at Mt. Vernon, Owen con-
tinued to speculate extensively.45 Neighbors began to doubt his

THE Indiana law of 1836 was not an isolated phenomenon
upon the American scene. Ever since the close of the second
war with England there had been a growing demand for better
facilities of transportation. Among the states New York had
led the way with her Erie Canal, and a decade later Ohio broke
ground for the first of her public works. The Hoosiers were not
immune to this universal enthusiasm for internal improvements ;
and their acceptance in 1826 and 1828 of two federal land
grants for projects connecting the Ohio and the lakes provided
an entering wedge for a state-wide system of their own. After
eight years of lobbying and log-rolling a powerful bi-partisan
bloc appropriated in January 1836 $10,000,000 for eight major
works designed for national utility while benefitting sectional
interests. In the populous and wealthy southeastern corner of
Indiana a canal was to follow the Whitewater Valley between
Lawrenceburg and Cambridge City. The Wabash and Erie
Canal, for which the grant in 1828 had been made, was to be
extended south of Lafayette to Terre Haute. A railroad was to
bear in a northwesterly route from Madison to Lafayette by
way of Indianapolis; and a second one, or a macadamized road,
was to run in the same general direction only through the coun-
ties to the south, connecting Jeffersonville and Crawfordsville.
A modern turnpike was to be laid upon the old stagecoach route
from Vincennes to New Albany. An appropriation was made
for the improvement of the Wabash, and a survey authorized
for a future canal or railway from Ft. Wayne to Michigan City.
The most daring and expensive enterprise of all, however, was

The "Mammoth Bill" of 1836 undoubtedly represented the
demands of the people of Indiana. All groups favored im-
provements in the abstract, and when criticism arose, it came
mainly from those counties not directly benefitted. Such a one
was Posey, and it was there that Owen took the lead in pro-
testing against the details of the proposed system. For the
chief purpose of procuring for his county its share of the public
works he decided to enter politics and late in March 1836 an-
nounced his candidacy for the lower house of the legislature.

Owen's own contemporary statement, as well as the conduct of

save the people of Indiana $300,000. Shortly thereafter, under
the pseudonym of "Tullius," he penned three widely copied
letters entitled "Indiana's Great Work," the really first critical
discussion of the recently enacted law. The system, he con-
cluded, would never be abandoned, nor did he desire such a
step. To add new works, he believed, was financially dangerous;
to leave some counties unprovided for was politically dangerous.

These words convinced Owen that his original plan to revise
the law of 1836 and alter the route of the Central Canal was
futile. Tacking on a different course, he supported a bill which,
because it was smaller than the previous year's was familiarly
called the "calf." Its purpose was to provide improvements for
those counties hitherto neglected. The first "calf" bill was re-
ferred to a select committee; and on December 19 Owen re-
ported an amended version appropriating a little less than
$2,000,000, a fifth of the former grant, in small amounts for
county turnpikes, new surveys, and subscriptions to private

This report initiated a bitter four-day debate during which
Owen spoke twice. His maiden effort, abounding in historical
allusions and aptly chosen phrases, set forth the necessity and
justice of the bill. Half the counties, he asserted, would derive
no substantial good from the law of 1836; and their representa-
tives must now either obtain additional works or curtail the tax
burden that would fall upon their constituents. The majority
hastened, in response, to scotch this uprising. No law, it was
argued, could directly benefit every county; but that of the
previous year had at least created a unified system, whereas
the present one was a catch-all. One member dragged the abor-
tive New Harmony experiment into the debate; while his col-
leagues assailed the proposed change as excessive in cost,
inconsistent in principle, and designed to destroy the progress
already made. Owen spoke a second time but in vain. On
December 22, in an almost full house, the "calf" was over-

These defeats left Owen in a difficult position. He seemed
unable to aid his county in any way. With their large majority
the system men, as they came to be called, bade fair to sweep
all before them, including the disposal of the surplus revenue.
Already Owen had on several occasions expressed his willing-
ness to finance the "calf" bill with that gift.
12
But in an attempt
to score some triumph in the general rout, he boldly reversed
his stand, opposing its use for internal improvements and seek-
ing to divert at least a part to the support of public schools, a
matter in which his constituents had shown interest.
13
At first
Owen's eloquent speech of January 1 1 praising the benefits of
education fell on deaf ears. Six days afterwards a bill was
reported reserving the interest on the surplus revenue for the
payment of the debt being created by the public works pro-
gram.
14
At this juncture Owen resorted to a successful stratagem.
Perceiving a division among the majority between those who
would place the surplus revenue in bank stock and those who
would distribute it among the several counties, he instructed
his followers to vote against first one proposition and then the
other always with the purpose of preventing the passage of
either. Out of the deadlock created by these tactics arose a
compromise between Owen and Joel Vandaveer that placed all
of the federal money in the hands of the counties but allotted
a third of the interest to the Common School Fund. On Janu-
ary 23 this bill passed an astonished House and then was so
amended in the Senate as to give half of the interest to educa-
tion. Much as Owen preferred that amendment, he stood loyally
by the compromise until Vandaveer, losing his nerve, himself
violated the agreement. That step left Owen free to support
the Senate version which, after another struggle, became law.

son to be absent from New Harmony much of the spring, his
triumph was never in doubt. Cralle, his chief opponent, avoided
the public meetings where Owen was advocating a policy of
classification, that is, limiting the financial risk by completing
only one or two of the major works at a time. Instead he sought
political capital by spreading false rumors and exposing his
rival's alleged immorality. His tactics, however, proved fruit-
less. In a somewhat lighter vote than the previous year, Owen
was reelected by a greater majority and with a larger percentage
of the total votes cast.

The foremost issue in the Twenty-Second Session was classi-
fication. Until then that policy had been thrust aside partly be-
cause it was thought unnecessary but mostly because the Board
of Internal Improvements contained at least one member ac-
tively interested in each project. During his first term Owen
had voted for a resolution favoring classification but only
after the failure of his "calf" bill. In the spring of 1837 the
matter was discussed before the people, and the election of
David Wallace in August as governor was everywhere inter-

steps in his later work. Foremost among these were his attempts
to obtain for married women greater control of their own prop-

Free Enquirer and had served as a topic for debate in the New
Harmony Institute. Early in 1835 an incident in his village

his first term he merely inquired into the expediency of adopt-

about the proposal and it did not extend to real estate.

Closely allied to the injustice perpetrated by the common
law upon married women was that which denied to the widow
of an intestate the greater portion of her husband's possessions.
Under the existing Indiana statutes the wife received but a
third of his real and personal property, the former during her
lifetime only; while the rest descended to the children, grand-
children, parents, brothers, and others more remote of kin.
But on this matter, too, Owen did not proceed as a radical
innovator. He did not insist uncompromisingly upon a change,
but waited until the old law of descent came before him and
another, acting as a sub-committee to revise the statutes of the
state. He then proposed to give the widow two thirds of the
husband's personal property and one third of his real estate in
fee absolute. At the outset the House seemed hostile to the
idea, which was described by one delegate as a subtle plot "to
subvert the whole system of society"; but after a warm debate
in which Owen spoke eloquently in behalf of the unrepresented
fairer sex, the committee report, only slightly amended, was
carried by acclamation.
37
The omission of this enlightened law
from the revised code five years later compelled Owen to do the
work over again in 1851 and 1852.
The only other step taken by Owen at this time in woman's
behalf did not stamp him as a radical reformer. To Indiana's
already liberal divorce law he merely added one more cause for
separation, habitual drunkenness for two years.

century when the Hoosier state had become a haven for un-

for himself and is good for anything, is, in early youth, almost neces-

In spite of partisan editorial sniping the people of Indian-
apolis were convinced, after three winters, that Owen was no
dangerous radical, harboring principles inimical to everything

The quotation most frequently used came from the Bacheler debate where
Owen argued that if he believed the Biblical statement that all power was of
God, he must necessarily believe all the Revolutionary patriots were consigned
to hell. He added that he did not believe that, but partisan editors ignored the
proviso and called his argument an insult to all true Americans. Free Enquirer,

had not been repeatedly mentioned by politicians. Madison Daily Tribune,

In spite of partisan editorial sniping the people of Indian-
apolis were convinced, after three winters, that Owen was no
dangerous radical, harboring principles inimical to everything
.. The quotation most frequently used came from the Bacheler debate where
Owen argued that if he believed the Biblical statement that all power was of
God, he must necessarily believe all the Revolutionary patriots were consigned
to hell. He added that he did not believe that, but partisan editors ignored the
proviso and called his argument an insult to all true Americans. Free Enquirer,
Oct. 15, 1831. Jacob P. Dunn, Indiana and Indianans (Chi., 1919), I, 459, has
stated without evidence that Moral Physiology circulated widely among the
Hoosiers. The present writer agrees with Milton Gregg, a contemporary critic
of Owen, that the treatise would have been little known in Indiana if its title
had not been repeatedly mentioned by politicians. Madison Daily Tribune,

on the best of terms with Governor Noah Noble, the father, if
any one may so be called, of the system of i836.

While at the
capital Owen first met many of his future Congressional col-
leagues: Joseph A. Wright, the typical self-made man of the
West; independent, outspoken John Pettit; and Andrew Ken-
nedy, the eloquent but boisterous blacksmith. The redoubtable
Jesse D. Bright was still unheard of, but during the session of
1839 Owen sat near Joseph Lane, not yet raised to heroic pro-
portions by the Mexican War. All in all, the more worldly
and talented Scot found much to admire and respect in the
Hoosier farmer-legislator. He probably disliked the religious
zeal and prudish hypocrisy of many of his new associates, but
he acted in the words of the poet he was then so fond of quoting,
Shall I ask the brave soldier who fights by my side,
In the cause of mankind, if our creeds agree?
Shall I give up the friend I have valued and tried,
If he kneel not before the same altar with me?
From the heretic girl of my soul shall I fly,
To seek some where else, a more orthodox kiss?
No! Perish the hearts and the laws, that try
Truth, valor, or love, by a standard like this!
47
With the emergence of new interests and new friendships
came a corresponding decline in old. While in the legislature,
Owen made no contribution to liberal periodicals and outwardly
severed all connection with the freethought movement in the
East. In 1839 he was made an officer of the United States
Moral and Philosophical Society, but he took no part in its
proceedings. Vale, Kneeland, and the latter's successor, Horace
Seaver, did not choose to notice publicly this growing aloofness.
On the contrary, they pointed with pride to the political progress

in 1832 was probably the last occasion that the two met; and
after the adjustment of the debt by D'Arusmont the next year,
even direct correspondence was broken off.
Late in 1836, when Owen was launching his career upon the
stormy sea of politics, Frances resumed her freethought agi-
tation as a lecturer and associate editor of the Boston Investi-

Vale, or some other journalistic friend in the course of which
he asked about his former partner, adding by way of explanation
that a misunderstanding between himself and another, not
Madame D'Arusmont, had caused a lapse in their correspond-

NATIONAL POLITICS
WHEN in the spring of 1839 Owen announced his return to
private life, he had reached a decision that was both intelligent
and imperative. There is no reason to believe that it was in-
sincere. Still under forty, he had risen rapidly and further
political advancement could hardly be jeopardized by a momen-
tary withdrawal. The need for some attention to his disordered
finances was unanimously voiced by Maclure's correspondents
in New Harmony.
1
Although those opinions were not altogether
impartial, their general correctness is confirmed by the frag-
mentary records of Owen's business dealings. The land boom
along the Wabash, hoped for in 1836, had not materialized;
and the depression that began the following year had embar-
rassed several speculative ventures of the Owens. Despite a
$7,500 profit in Evansville lots and the receipt for an invest-
ment of $20,000 from their father, the brothers in their col-
lective enterprises lost $2,550 annually in 1837, 1838, and
i839.

Owen's earlier hopes of economic independence were
rapidly fading, and in later life he ruefully admitted that
he and his brothers had neither known how to develop West-
ern property nor applied themselves steadily to business pur-
suits.

Although Owen may not have been so reluc-
tant as he appeared to place party above personal demands, it
is certain that the erstwhile reformer did not realize the dis-
advantages under which he was to labor. The depression had
placed the Van Buren men on the defensive; while the Whigs,
who had barely lost the district two years before when they
were badly divided, were now united and confident. Their stand-
ard bearer had opened his campaign in April and had already
attracted many independent voters. Lockhart's mysterious re-
tirement enabled the opposition to charge dictation and cor-
ruption.

The Democrats were further hampered by having
but one newspaper, established only late in May, with which
to combat the onslaught of the four local Whig journals. Most
serious of all was the task Owen faced of convincing in the
short time at his disposal the people of ten other counties what
he had already proved to the citizens of Posey that he was
not a dangerous radical but a sane, liberal, constructive legis-

compressed all the news on to one page in four, when many
people could not read and still more could not afford to subscribe
to the local gazette, election methods were very different from
what they are today. It was then the custom for the candidates
to speak together almost daily during the two months before

previous appointment had been made. Although Saturdays
found the antagonists at the Court House of the county seat,
the other five speeches of the week might be made at a cross-
roads' store, in a field where the farmers were at work, or deep
in a forest glade. Two hours of speaking by each man was the
minimum, and often a rebuttal was required. This practice of
stumping may have produced loquacious Congressmen from
the West, but it also made possible a more intelligent use of
the ballot by poor and illiterate backwoodsmen.6
Owen's campaign for Congress was his first taste of stump
speaking on an extended scale. In June he and his Whig rival,
the volatile George H. Proffit, met in Posey and the adjacent
counties of Vanderburg, Warrick, Gibson, and Pike. In the
following month they worked their way eastward until on the
last Saturday before the election they addressed the people at
the old state capital of Corydon. On this tour Proffit had a
decided advantage. Some of the places he had visited once or
twice before; everywhere Owen was making his first appear-
ance. At the same time the Whig candidate was the better
orator, his loud, clear voice and winning manners being ideally
suited to open air gatherings.
7
Proffit's abilities were best suited
to the stump; Owen's to a legislative chamber. The former
resorted to wit and humor, the latter relied on facts and logic.
The two men had clashed consistently in the Assembly at In-
dianapolis, and each knew the strength and weakness of the
other.
The political issues dividing the contestants were not many.
In state affairs there was a wide gap, Owen having been a
modifier and Proffit a system man. In the national arena,
however, Proffit did not advocate extreme Whig tenets. He
glossed over the tariff in silence. He denied that his party was
pledged to restore the bank and dismissed the monster as a dead
issue. His blows were directed chiefly against the Sub-Treasury
Act and the alleged dishonesty of Democratic office-holders.

Owen fought mainly on the defensive, trying to justify the Van
Buren administration in toto?
Personal rather than political matters dominated the cam-
paign of 1839. Even before Owen had become a candidate, the
Democratic state organ had so roundly attacked Profit's moral
and religious traits that the later virulent assaults upon the
former editor of The Free Enquirer were not altogether unjusti-
fied.
9
On the Whig side the prime source of vituperation and
scurrility was a small clique of Evansville lawyers, Robert
Evans, Amos Clark, and W. T. T. Jones, whose hatred of Owen
dated from either the community experiment or the unsuccessful
attempt to eliminate Evansville as the terminus of the Central
Canal. These men received valiant assistance from local editors,
who did not hesitate to reprint parts of Moral Physiology in
their columns, from intolerant clergymen to whom Owen's
freethought was anathema, and from several determined ladies
who openly campaigned for Proffit in the supposed interest of
orthodoxy and morality. One Malinda Miller won fleeting fame
by warning her Democratic spouse that a vote for Owen consti-
tuted a just cause for divorce.
10

Owen fought mainly on the defensive, trying to justify the Van
Buren administration in toto.8
Personal rather than political matters dominated the cam-
paign of 1839. Even before Owen had become a candidate, the
Democratic state organ had so roundly attacked Proffit's moral
and religious traits that the later virulent assaults upon the
former editor of The Free Enquirer were not altogether unjusti-
fied.9 On the Whig side the prime source of vituperation and
scurrility was a small clique of Evansville lawyers, Robert
Evans, Amos Clark, and W. T. T. Jones, whose hatred of Owen
dated from either the community experiment or the unsuccessful
attempt to eliminate Evansville as the terminus of the Central
Canal. These men received valiant assistance from local editors,
who did not hesitate to reprint parts of Moral Physiology in
their columns, from intolerant clergymen to whom Owen's
freethought was anathema, and from several determined ladies
who openly campaigned for Proffit in the supposed interest of
orthodoxy and morality. One Malinda Miller won fleeting fame
by warning her Democratic spouse that a vote for Owen consti-
tuted a just cause for divorce.10

lator Owen might become, how tactful an attitude he might
adopt toward the orthodox, or how far he might go to explain,
justify, and retract, his earlier writings would always be a
political bugbear to him. It was evident that in every sub-
sequent election he would labor under the handicap of virulent
personal invective. The danger was that his own party, fearing
his vulnerability, might refuse him another Congressional nom-
ination. If that fear were translated into action, then his hopes
for political advancement that had burned so brightly the pre-
vious spring would soon be extinguished. To prevent such a
possibility from becoming a reality was for him the vital prob-
lem raised by defeat.
After a month of reflection and inquiry Owen resolved that
problem. Despite financial exigencies and the wisdom of letting
passions cool, he decided to return to the political arena. To
the electors of the district he issued a long address, explaining
his recent canvass and rationalizing his decision into a belief
that he was battling for the right of private judgment in public
life.

Yet in his heart of hearts Owen probably realized that
it was the aid he might render his party in the forthcoming

uphold that would most facilitate Congressional nominations
in the future.
As a result of this important decision Owen spent the next
twelve months immersed in the swirling tides of national poli-
tics. His first care was to mend fences at home. His ringing
post-election circular reestablished his prestige in the district,
and editors at Paoli and New Albany insisted that he be re-

took this gubernatorial boom seriously, but its beneficiary soon

18
Nevertheless Owen played
an important role in the Democratic State Convention held at
Indianapolis in January 1840. There he delivered the address
to the people that defined the issues for the presidential con-
test, and there he was chosen as the Van Buren elector in the
First District with the specific task of waging another strenu-
ous campaign.
19
Accordingly Owen took the field late in April in behalf of
the state and national candidates. He spoke several times in the
Bloomington area and then addressed an important gathering
at the capital. At the end of June he set out with John W.
Payne, the Whig elector, on a tour of the First District, covering
much the same ground as he had the previous year. In Sep-
tember he went round the circuit a second time, worked his way
northward through Sullivan and Monroe counties, and then
swung homeward via the more westerly towns of Greencastle,
Terre Haute, and Vincennes.20
One other interesting aspect of Owen's activity in 1840 was
his attempt to mold public opinion through the newspapers.
The lack of a strong Democratic press in the western part of
the First District had been a severe handicap to Owen in his
Congressional canvass, and in the few months after his defeat
he repaired that deficiency by helping to set up at Evansville
the South-Western Sentinel in charge of Jacob Page Chapman,

With this organ at his disposal the Demo-

duce reason and honesty into a campaign of emotion and eva-
sion, these articles conclusively proved that the former editor
of The Free Enquirer had lost none of his old journalistic
ability.
22
The year 1840, however, was ill-suited to Owen's overlong
and highly rational disquisitions. His untiring energy on the
stump similarly proved unavailing. Indiana was still a Whig
state and Harrison, a local idol, had already bested Van Buren
there in 1836. Thus with a log cabin as a hull, hard cider as
cargo, and a coon as mascot, the good ship Whiggery, propelled
by a veritable gale of songs, huzzas, and empty words, sailed
majestically on, carrying to the highest office in the land a man
of undisputed bravery, experience, and personal integrity, but
one whose future policies were shrouded from Democrats and
Whigs alike. For months the Hoosier state was dotted with
giant barbecues, while its staid newspapers printed tremendous
woodcuts of the gallant general sitting on a cider keg by the
open door of a log cabin. In November Harrison swept to
victory, carrying every Congressional district in the state, the
First by a startling margin of 1,100 votes.
23
In spite of the complete rout of the Democrats in Indiana,
Owen had not lost all by his year's efforts. His ceaseless activ-
ity had made him a valuable party worker and had wiped away
the stain of his defeat in 1839. He had become favorably known

outlook was gloomy and when there was no immediate personal
reward at stake. Now he could retire gracefully to attend to
private affairs, leaving a credit balance in his favor on the
Democratic ledger. And he did so with a clear recognition of
that debt by the party organ at the state capital which asserted,
"Mr. Owen has probably done more for the cause of Democracy
than any other man in Indiana. . . . We hope the Democracy
. . . will not forget him who does not forget them."
24
Owen's subsequent retirement from public life was more
apparent than real. To be sure he held no office and undertook
no campaign in 1841 and 1842 but remained quietly at New
Harmony occupied with business, family, and local matters.
Yet he kept in touch with old colleagues, made occasional
political speeches, and saw his name advanced rather promi-
nently for United States Senator in the autumn of i842.
25
It
is not altogether unlikely that Owen found the opportunity
convenient to lie low until the political skies had brightened.
And it is well that he did. The Whig tide that had swept the
state in 1840 did not ebb until after the Congressional elections
held prematurely the following spring. With Owen declining
to run, Lockhart took the field in the First District, only to be
buried under an avalanche of Proffit votes. To the conquest of
all branches of the state government made the previous year
the Whigs now added six of the seven Hoosier seats in Con-
gress. The early summer of 1841 marked the nadir of Demo-
cratic fortunes in Indiana, and at that time Jacob Page
Chapman gave up an apparently hopeless battle and suspended
publication of the South-Western Sentinel.^
Eighteen months later the picture was completely changed.
In the state the Democrats were staging an impressive recovery.

lished at the capital by the Chapman brothers in July 1841, they

that debt by the party organ at the state capital which asserted,
"Mr. Owen has probably done more for the cause of Democracy
than any other man in Indiana. . . . We hope the Democracy
... will not forget him who does not forget them." 24
Owen's subsequent retirement from public life was more
apparent than real. To be sure he held no office and undertook
no campaign in r84r and r842 but remained quietly at New
Harmony occupied with business, family, and local matters.
Yet he kept in touch with old colleagues, made occasional
political speeches, and saw his name advanced rather promi-
nently for United States Senator in the autumn of 1842.25 It
is not altogether unlikely that Owen found the opportunity
convenient to lie low until the political skies had brightened.
And it is well that he did. The Whig tide that had swept the
state in 1840 did not ebb until after the Congressional elections
held prematurely the following spring. With Owen declining
to run, Lockhart took the field in the First District, only to be
buried under an avalanche of Proffit votes. To the conquest of
all branches of the state government made the previous year
the Whigs now added six of the seven Hoosier seats in Con-
gress. The early summer of 184r marked the nadir of Demo-
cratic fortunes in Indiana, and at that time Jacob Page
Chapman gave up an apparently hopeless battle and suspended
publication of the South-Western Sentinel.26
Eighteen months later the picture was completely changed.
In the state the Democrats were staging an impressive recovery.

lished at the capital by the Chapman brothers in July r84r, they

In the First District the skies had also

Jr., and dedicated to the political advancement of Robert Dale
Owen, had been begun in Evansville and was soon to move to
New Harmony. By withdrawing from the Senatorial race in
1842 in the interest of party harmony, the former radical fur-
ther strengthened his claim to the Congressional candidacy in
1843. As a matter of fact, there was never much doubt that he
could have the nomination if he desired it. At first, however,
Owen demurred, even going so far as to say he did not wish
to run; but at the District Convention held at Jasper on
April 10, 1843, he was unanimously chosen. The prompt accept-
ance that followed left him in the strong position of having been,
apparently, drafted for the race.

The canvass of 1843 was among the most strenuous Owen
ever undertook. Between late May and early August he spoke
at more than sixty public meetings in the district. Yet the task
was a pleasant one, for at last everything seemed to be going
right. Off to an early start, Owen carefully distributed a well
prepared address To the Electors of the First Congressional
District of Indiana in which he proclaimed protection to be
the chief issue and scored the Whigs for breaking their promises
of 1840. His opponent, John W. Payne, upheld the Act of
1842; and thus, in contrast to four years before, the contest
saw a full debate of party principles, the tariff, the currency,
and internal improvements. At the same time, and again in
contrast to 1839, there was no revived religious hysteria. Payne

The first Monday in August found Owen again at Corydon,

of his well conducted campaign was highly gratifying. When
the official vote was tabulated, he led by a margin of 577, an
overturn of 1,942 ballots in two years. This excellent showing,
an admirable personal achievement, was not, however, an iso-
lated victory. The Hoosier election of 1843 was rightly called
by the Chapmans a "revolution." For the first time since state-
hood, Indiana's executive chair and General Assembly were in
the hands of the Democrats. In addition, where two years ago
that party had won but a single Congressional seat, it now
captured eight out of ten.

mainly an apathy among the voters; while other Whig editors
deplored the triumph of atheism and "universal concubinage."
Freethinkers like Burns saw religious liberty in politics vin-
dicated. Some truth may be found in these explanations. Polit-
ical rather than personal issues dominated the canvass. Owen
made an eloquent plea for a Congressman's right of private

THE American people in 1843 were in a buoyant, optimistic,
expansionist mood. Ever since independence they had regarded
themselves as a chosen race, destined by their successful de-
velopment of free institutions to uplift the Western World.
During most of their national existence they had been content
to serve as a beacon light for the oppressed of all lands, to
spread democracy by example, by remote control as it were.
Recently, however, there had arisen a widespread belief that
the United States had a more immediate mission to perform, to
become an active rather than a passive champion of liberty, to
cast its republican mantle over the entire continent. This belief
was fed by a fear that the European monarchies were intriguing
to establish a balance of power in the New World. These ex-
ponents of Manifest Destiny had no conscious desire to propa-
gate their faith by the sword, no selfish wish to create a
dependent empire. Convinced that man could live most happily
under the American constitution, they sought simply an area

Owen's election to Congress coincided with the breaking of
this new wave of expansionist sentiment against the boundaries
established after the second war with England. In particular,
both the Oregon and Texas problems were ripe for solution.
Both had a complicated past that can only be summarized here.
In two important treaties negotiated in 1818 and 1819 the
United States had fixed its northern limits at 49 and its south-
ern at a zigzag line that began at the mouth of the Sabine and
terminated along the 42nd parallel. To obtain these metes and
bounds American diplomats had been forced to renounce the
territory between the Sabine and the Rio Grande, claimed by
this nation under the Louisiana Purchase, and to accept, in
view of conflicting titles, joint occupation with England of the
Oregon country, that region lying between 49 and 54 40'
and between the mountains and the Pacific.
During the next quarter of a century these territorial settle-
ments were undone by the steady westward march of the
American pioneer. In the Southwest Mexico's liberal land
policy attracted many immigrants to Texas; and when the in-
evitable clash between divergent civilizations occurred, an in-
dependent republic resulted. In the Northwest the American
trapper was succeeded in the thirties by the New England
missionary and finally by the boisterous backwoodsman of the
Mississippi Valley frontier. It was this last element that chal-
lenged the long-standing domination in the Willamette and
Columbia valleys of the Hudson's Bay Company and which
might have precipitated another armed conflict if the officials
of that company had not decided to move their main post to
Vancouver Island. By the summer of 1843 both problems were
being thrust before the American people, Oregon by a series of
popular conventions in the West which declared our rights to
54 40' to be "unquestionable," Texas by rumored Anglo-
French intrigues looking toward the abolition of slavery and
the erection of a permanent barrier to the southward expansion
of the United States. In October diplomatic negotiations were

Texas and Oregon played no part in the Democratic revolu-
tion of 1843 in Indiana. In the Owen-Payne contest, as in the
state at large, the tariff was the chief issue, and little or no
reference was made to territorial extension. Yet scarcely two
months after his victory Owen had decided that the Oregon
question would and ought to occupy much attention in the
approaching session. In a public letter, printed for his con-
stituents and widely copied in the Eastern press, he declared
that the time had come to assert our just claims and to take
possession of the territory without bloodshed before the Hud-
son's Bay Company, profiting by joint occupancy, made peace-
ful penetration impossible. These remarks Owen supplemented
with a lecture at New Harmony in which he described the value
of the disputed region, a value often denied, and strongly urged
an immediate settlement with the British government. The
Whigs at once ascribed political motives to the new Congress-
man's activity; but the fact remains that, whatever his mo-
tives, Owen was leading public opinion in his district, not
following it.

If before his departure from New Harmony Owen had begun
to breathe the spirit of Manifest Destiny, he became soon after
his arrival in Washington one of its most ardent devotees. The
leading expansionists of the Twenty-Eighth Congress that con-
vened in December 1843 came from the West, and it was these
with whom Owen was most readily thrown into contact. Since
Congressional wives were still the exception rather than the
rule in the national capital, the Indianan took up bachelor's
quarters at Mrs. Haltingly's on Pennsylvania Avenue just
below Third Street. All the members of this "mess" lived
beyond the mountains. One was the son-in-law of the late
Lewis F. Linn, long a champion of Oregon in the upper house.

The ablest were the two Ohio Senators, William Allen and
Benjamin Tappan, the latter being a brother of the New York
philanthropists against whom Owen had inveighed a dozen
years before. Most, however, like Andrew Kennedy and John
Pettit, fellow Hoosiers, or John B. Weller of Ohio were the
boisterous and bumptious type whom the Eastern Whigs so
liked to satirize. It was, it must be admitted, a rather crude
group, talented in only a limited sense, and one into which the
intellectually inclined and well born Scot would have had diffi-
culty fitting if it had not been for his decade of conditioning
in the Indiana backwoods.4
After a month devoted to organization and trivialities, the
House got down to the serious business of the session. Since it
was Democratic in complexion and the Senate was still con-
trolled by the Whigs, there was no chance for tariff reform;
and as most commentators had predicted, expansion was pushed
to the fore. Owen quickly revealed the policy he planned to
pursue. In his annual message Tyler had kept silent on the
negotiations for the annexation of Texas, but had recommended
the extension of American laws over the Oregon country and
the erection of military posts along the main routes of travel
to it.
5
That was the procedure Linn had vainly pressed upon
Congress for almost a decade, but to Owen it did not seem to
meet the problem squarely. On January 4, therefore, he offered
a joint resolution requesting the president to give England, in
accordance with the Convention of 1827, notice that the joint
occupation of Oregon would be terminated at the end of twelve
months. Although criticized by the Whigs as a move to break
off the very negotiations that the United States in October had
requested Great Britain to commence, Owen's proposal was
lauded by the Democratic press as the only practical solution
of the problem. The conservative Committee on Foreign Affairs,
however, did not agree with Blair and Bryant; and after a three-

pursue. In his annual message Tyler had kept silent on the
negotiations for the annexation of Texas, but had recommended
the extension of American laws over the Oregon country and
the erection of military posts along the main routes of travel
to it.5 That was the procedure Linn had vainly pressed upon
Congress for almost a decade, but to Owen it did not seem to
meet the problem squarely. On January 4, therefore, he offered
a joint resolution requesting the president to give England, in
accordance with the Convention of r82 7, notice that the joint
occupation of Oregon would be terminated at the end of twelve
months. Although criticized by the Whigs as a move to break
off the very negotiations that the United States in October had
requested Great Britain to commence, Owen's proposal was
lauded by the Democratic press as the only practical solution
of the problem. The conservative Committee on Foreign Affairs,
however, did not agree with Blair and Bryant; and after a three-

discussions from London to Washington then taking place, it
was inexpedient to act at that time.

Yet Owen's motion, the
first of its kind presented in either house during the session,
proved to be the method by which the boundary dispute was
finally put into a train of settlement.
As author of the resolution thus summarily rejected, Owen
rose to reply in what was properly his maiden speech. He denied
that his suggestion was untimely and warned that there could
be no solution until "we assume an attitude more independent
than has hitherto characterized our proceedings relative to
Oregon." To give the year's notice would, he believed, convince
England of our earnestness. While the joint occupation re-
mained, the United States could not legally grant land titles in
the Columbia Valley. Yet already the great migration was in
full swing, never to be checked. When, the Indianan concluded,
you can whistle back the mountain eagle in his upward flight to the

mad career; when you can quench, in the bird of passage, that instinct
which bids her be up and away to the regions nature designed for
her, then, then only, expect to set up mete or bound short of the

during the remainder of the session no "notice," not even the
fortification bill that the president requested, was passed. As
a step, however, to arouse public interest in the question and
to gain personal credit the Hoosier's maiden effort was emi-
nently successful. Almost forty papers reprinted his words in
full, and within three days 21,000 pamphlet copies had been
sold. Owen's was the first address of the new Congress to be
published in its entirety by the two Democratic journals in
New York, and it appeared twice in the national party organ.

The agitation thus begun was continued by Owen and other
Westerners through the presentation of memorials and peti-
tions and helped pave the way for the inclusion at the
Democratic Convention in Baltimore of the resolution for the
"re-occupation of Oregon."
Unlike the Oregon question, Congress had little occasion to
discuss Texas until the very eve of the presidential campaign.
Up to mid-March the secrecy of the negotiations, the latent
antislavery sentiment in the North, and the impossibility of
legislating before the diplomats acted had kept the matter in
the background. Some bold spirits desired to link Texas and
Oregon into a single expansionist measure, but the first steps
in that direction were voted down on March 2$.

into politics he had fought for the squire of Lindenwald. Yet

lose the tide that might sweep him into the inner circle of the
new party leaders. Thus on the one hand, he refused to sign
a card subscribed to by every other member of the Indiana
delegation declaring that, if Van Buren were nominated, Clay
would be elected. On the other hand he wrote an open letter
to The Globe under his old pseudonym "Tullius," criticizing
extremists in both the pro-Texas and anti-Texas ranks. Cau-

annex the region up to the Rio Grande, but he insisted that the

would become a party principle.

United States, he asserted, had both a duty and a right to annex
Texas at once and up to the Rio Grande. The duty arose from
the pledge given in 1803 and not impaired in 1819 to provide
free institutions for the Texans. The right was conferred by
international law whereby one nation might negotiate with a
government that had won its independence and maintained it
for several years. In thus advocating immediate annexation
Owen declined to become an apologist for the South's peculiar
institution. He criticized Calhoun's unfortunate reply to Paken-

nent without injury to its free institutions. Finally the ex-
reformer did not believe that annexation meant war. On the
contrary, he felt that inaction would only encourage the Mexi-
can generals to carry their threatened butchery across the Rio
Grande. "Boldly, then," he concluded,
and without reserve, let us meet the question. Let us annex Texas
at once. The liberal portion of the world will approve, the rest will
acquiesce; and, in ten years, the wonder will be, not that Texas
has settled quietly down into an integral portion of our confederacy;
but that men should ever have been found, so blind to the interests
of their country, as to oppose her annexation.24
In none of his Congressional speeches was Owen so carried
away by the buoyant optimism of the hour as in this second on
the Texan question. He failed to foresee not only that an-
nexation would lead to war but also that victory in that war,
while inevitable, was not the matter of a few weeks or "a
couple of regiments of good Kentucky riflemen." Too easily
did the Hoosier accept the prevalent theory that to disperse
slavery over a larger area was to hasten emancipation in the
Border States. Most questionable of all was his assertion
that the province of legislation grew smaller as an intelligent
population extended its boundaries. This line of reasoning,
which Owen had already elaborated in a magazine article, was
promptly criticized by the Whigs.
25
Yet despite these short-
comings the address was lavishly praised by Democratic editors,
and it became at once the most heavily subscribed for oration
yet made during the session. Success, moreover, followed in its

nent without injury to its free institutions. Finally the ex-
reformer did not believe that annexation meant war. On the
contrary, he felt that inaction would only encourage the Mexi-
can generals to carry their threatened butchery across the Rio
Grande. "Boldly, then," he concluded,
and without reserve, let us meet the question. Let us annex Texas
at once. The liberal portion of the world will approve, the rest will
acquiesce; and, in ten years, the wonder will be, not that Texas
has settled quietly down into an integral portion of our confederacy;
but that men should ever have been found, so blind to the interests
of their country, as to oppose her annexation.24
In none of his Congressional speeches was Owen so carried
away by the buoyant optimism of the hour as in this second on
the Texan question. He failed to foresee not only that an-
nexation would lead to war but also that victory in that war,
while inevitable, was not the matter of a few weeks or "a
couple of regiments of good Kentucky riflemen." Too easily
did the Hoosier accept the prevalent theory that to disperse
slavery over a larger area was to hasten emancipation in the
Border States. Most questionable of all was his assertion
that the province of legislation grew smaller as an intelligent
population extended its boundaries. This line of reasoning,
which Owen had already elaborated in a magazine article, was
promptly criticized by the Whigs.25 Yet despite these short-
comings the address was lavishly praised by Democratic editors,
and it became at once the most heavily subscribed for oration
yet made during the session. Success, moreover, followed in its
wake. On January 2 5 a joint resolution to annex the Lone Star
Republic passed the House.26

terested had been solved to his liking, and on those that had
not he had taken a stand that coincided with the views of a
majority of his constituents. In the short space of one term he

her state debt, a letter that convinced many, in the East at

sentative was Robert Dale Owen.32
Despite this progress Owen's renomination was not yet a

not unlike those of the Democrats in 1841 when Owen declined

strongest candidate, and it sorely lacked a winning issue. Payne
had been beaten on the tariff in 1843 and Texan annexation
was already a fait accompli. A bold stand on Oregon, to be
sure, was popular in the West, but the Democrats had already
pre-empted that position. For a time editor Chandler thought
he had a valuable weapon in Owen's delay in obtaining a much
desired local law, and he taunted his rival, saying, "If the canal

THE OREGON CRISIS
BEFORE returning to Washington to face the problems raised
by expansion, Owen made a second bid for the United States
Senate. In the autumn of 1845 the "Pocket's" Representative
was an outstanding candidate for a seat he had coveted as early
as 1839 and for which he had been prematurely suggested three
years before. From various parts of the state came demands
that his unquestionable talents be transferred to the upper
chamber. As in 1842, however, his chances were virtually de-
stroyed before the caucus met. It so happened that one of his
initial supporters, the Lawrenceburg Beacon, unwittingly in-
volved his candidacy in an internecine struggle then raging
among Hoosier Democrats with the result that the over-cautious
Owen in a well-intentioned but unnecessary public letter offered
to withdraw from the Senatorial race whenever it would pro-
mote party harmony. This statement was quickly distorted
by interested factions into a declaration that the Congressman
would not, under any circumstances, allow his name to be used.

By early December the Owen boom had collapsed. Since his
injudicious letter in September no important editor had come
out in his favor. Being a national official, Owen lacked both the
local patronage and the state-wide contacts possessed by his
chief rivals, Governor James Whitcomb and Lieutenant-Gov-
ernor Jesse D. Bright. Even his closest friends were dis-
couraged. "You are aware," wrote Joseph Lane from the state
capital on the eve of the election,

Lane's fears were only too well founded. Owen lacked
strength among the rank and file of the state legislators, and
in the caucus the next day he made the poorest showing of the
leading candidates. Once more the desired post eluded him,
going instead to Jesse D. Bright who was thus launched on
one of the most brilliant and fascinating political careers of any
ante-bellum Hoosier.3
Before Owen's Senatorial aspirations had been again crushed
in disappointment, the new session of Congress had commenced.
Life in the national capital during the coming winter promised
to be brighter for him; for to the companionship of his father,
again returned to America, was to be added that of Mary. The
prevailing custom that kept the wives of the lawmakers away
from Washington had not, during his first term, bothered the
Indianan very much. Intent upon establishing his name in the
political firmament, he had thrown himself into his public duties
with such industry that he found little time for ordinary recrea-

partisanship of the period by preventing Democrat and Whig
from meeting in social circles could hardly please the cultured
and gregarious Owen for long.

mess-mates of the first session all these, except Henry St. John
of Ohio, came from the East. In contrast to the alleged ruffian-
ism of Kennedy and Pettit, Robert P. Dunlap of Maine, Jacob
S. Yost of Pennsylvania, Orville Hungerford and George Rath-
bun of New York formed such a respectable group that one
correspondent jocularly termed it a "religious mess." "Robert
Dale Owen," he wrote, "is the archer of the establishment. He
'didn't used to be' so pious, but now he is a pattern of exemplary
Honorables." 5
As at Indianapolis, Owen dissipated all pre-
conceived ideas among strangers of his character by his tact,

mitted that "in private life ... he is amiable, courteous,
honest, decent in short, the very reverse of his public

As a public man he is without concealment; as a companion and
friend he is frank, vivacious, and instructive. He is a great walker,
and will give you every day an hour's exercise that will strain your
ancles or try your corns.6
Except for ex-Governor Dunlap of Maine, with whom he
lived again the following winter, Owen found his closest friends
outside the boarding house. More than a decade had passed
since he had urged Nicholas Trist to join a proposed intellectual
retreat on the Wabash, and during much of that time Trist's
absence from the country had caused a break in the formerly
intimate correspondence. Now, however, the two were thrown
together, for really the first time, in a setting that neither could
have foreseen in the hectic days of The Free Enquirer. In
August 1845 Trist returned to Washington in the important
post of Chief Clerk of the State Department, and in the trying
months of the Oregon crisis and the early part of the Mexican
War he and Owen were frequently together. It was Trist's

Democratic Congressmen and their families lodged. Unlike the
mess-mates of the first session all these, except Henry St. John
of Ohio, came from the East. In contrast to the alleged ruffi.an-
ism of Kennedy and Pettit, Robert P. Dunlap of Maine, Jacob
S. Yost of Pennsylvania, Orville Hungerford and George Rath-
bun of New York formed such a respectable group that one
correspondent jocularly termed it a "religious mess." "Robert
Dale Owen," he wrote, "is the archer of the establishment. He
'didn't used to be' so pious, but now he is a pattern of exemplary
Honorables." 5 As at Indianapolis, Owen dissipated all pre-
conceived ideas among strangers of his character by his tact,
sincerity, and gentlemanliness. Even his severest critic ad-

the point of view of the traditional settlers. The things they
lend they expect to be returned and they do not expect to
make large gifts, only enough to carry the refugee over. But
for how long a time must he be carried along? The refugee is
established; he does no work. The government does not even
provide work for him. There are not the tools, there is not
the land. The refugee goes on idling there, consuming goods
which the villagers nearby offer through their hard work.
From their point of view the refugees are an idle and com-
plaining lot. From the refugee point of view one is
dealing
with men whose hearts are of flint. The situation cannot
be handled at the grass-roots
level of the two contend-
ing parties;
it can only be handled by administrators wise
enough to provide in the very beginning for a joint coopera-
tive economic enterprise involving the various component
parts.
This in turn cannot possibly be done except with a
type of capital outlay which will make possible the effective
labor of the newly planted refugees.
But what of the attitude of the refugees toward the Mus-
lims from whom they escaped? Is it an attitude of unlimited
bitterness? One is
surprised to find two general principles
that seem to cut through any characterization of the Hindu-
Muslim hostility.
The first is the fact that in Hindu sam-
ples
which we took we found about 20 per cent practically
free of any special
bias in favor of their own group; about
20 per cent, that is, who say that there are always misun-
derstandings, that all human beings are essentially alike,
that there are good people and bad people in every group,
and specifically
that the Muslims are no worse than Hindus
or the Hindus no worse than Muslims. One finds likewise
among Muslims this small but substantial and clear-eyed
minority group, who refuse to take sides in the current ani-
mosities and name-calling hostilities. Even civil war does not
by any means uniformly produce an unbridgeable gulf of
noncommunication between two groups.

To a friend the president declared,
The only way to treat John Bull was to look him straight in the eye;
that I considered a bold & firm course on our part the pacific one;
that if Congress faultered or hesitated in their course, John Bull would
immediately become . . . more grasping in his demands.9
Such a bold course did not, it is true, frighten the British into
concessions. It did convince the English government that an
immediate settlement must be made, though whether that
settlement would be one of peace or war was not clear until
the very end.
Spurred on by presidential declarations and expansionist
sentiment at home, most Western Democrats quickly committed
themselves to a settlement at 54 40'. Owen, who had been
among the first to advocate formal cessation of joint occupancy,
now found himself among the moderates. His first speech dur-
ing the crisis, that of January 3, 1846, contained none of the
belligerent fanfare that had become the fashion of the hour.
It defended Polk from the extremists who were criticizing the
July offer to compromise at 49. On the other hand, it rejected
the Whig solution of arbitration. A second way out, continu-
ance of the agreement of 1827, Owen also opposed since that
arrangement had already enabled the Hudson's Bay Company
to prevent even a single American citizen from settling north
of the Columbia River, the chief area in dispute. A firm asser-
tion of our rights, the Indianan believed, would dispose England
to compromise; and he proposed to prove at a later date that a
just compromise should be drawn not, as the British wished,
at the Columbia River but at the 5 2nd parallel.

general debate began two days later. For five long weeks an
endless cannonade of words on war and peace, occupation and
arbitration, Manifest Destiny and national honor rent the air
until the earlier crowds in the galleries began to thin and the
vacant benches on the floor deprived the House of its quorum.
There was little chance to contribute anything new to the dis-
cussion, most of the speeches repeating the preceding ones with
monotonous regularity. Even the Western Whigs climbed on
the expansionist bandwagon; their bellicosity reflected the fact
that beyond the mountains the 54 40' spirit was burning at
white heat. The Indiana legislature instructed its Congressional
delegation to combat any compromise that would yield an inch
of American soil, while the Democratic convention in that state
opposed any umpirage for the question save at the cannon's
mouth.11
Late in the debate, but under rather dramatic circumstances,
Owen made his second and more important speech on the
Oregon question. Being tardy for the appointment, he entered
a chamber buzzing with anticipation; and without even taking
his seat, he threw off his cloak and began speaking at once. He
first pointed out that no boundary south of the 49th parallel
could be considered. To accept less would deprive the Ameri-
cans of the valuable harbors of Puget Sound so necessary for
their future trade with the Orient. The Indianan next sought
to prove that by the Nootka Convention of 1790, the very docu-
ment on which Great Britain rested her diplomatic claims, and
by contemporary interpretations of it, the United States had
the sole and undisputed title to all territory south of 49j4.
From this proposition he easily inferred that a just compromise
fell not at the 49th but at the 52nd parallel. In concluding, the
erstwhile reformer neither wished nor feared war, but appealed
to Congress to stand behind the president.
No temporizing policy [he said] befits the present crisis, nor can
avail to avert its dangers, if with any it be rife. Firmness, neither

12
Owen's resort to the Nootka Convention to strengthen Ameri-
can claims north of the Columbia brought him more credit, he
believed, than any of his earlier speeches in Congress. Hailed as
the single novel contribution to the tedious Oregon debate, the
interpretation was accepted by three later speakers and several
party papers.
13
One result, however, the Indianan had not fore-
seen. By concentrating on the indisputable American title south
of 49^ and upon the justice of a compromise at the S2nd
parallel, he aroused the ire of the extremists. As Hoge of Illi-
nois later remarked, a man who spent an hour justifying claims
to 49^ could not have had much faith in our right to 54 40'.
14
Being a Westerner, Owen felt the necessity of keeping his
record on expansion clean and at once prepared a corrected ver-
sion of his remarks for general circulation. By changing the
wording in three places and by inserting one new paragraph,
the Hoosier reached the conclusion that south of 49^2 the
title of the United States was uncontestable, that 52 was a
proper compromise, and that by the Nootka Convention Ameri-
can claims really extended beyond 54 40' ,
15
The significance of Owen's address lies not in the changes
provoked by Hoge but in its essentially moderate tone. This
moderation grew out of a realistic appreciation that the actual
area in dispute lay between the 49th parallel and the Columbia
River, the view now generally held by historians. Owen knew
that England had never proposed terms essentially better than
the river-parallel boundary. He knew also that on five occa-
sions she had refused to accept any compromise at approxi-

basis of occupation, British claims to the disputed triangle were
the stronger. Forty-nine., on the other hand, would give the
United States what it really wanted, good harbors on the
Pacific. Without admitting that he hoped for nothing more
than an equitable division, Owen resorted to the ingenious in-
terpretation of the Nootka Convention to bolster his country's
claims where they were weakest.
After no less than seventy speeches on the subject, the Ore-

three to one, including a majority of the Whigs and all but
sixteen Democrats, the "notice" was engrossed, and it passed
without a roll call. In the final form the clause requiring that
it be given "forthwith" was omitted, and a proviso was added
to the effect that the resolution was not intended to interfere
with negotiations for an amicable settlement.

These changes
did little to weaken the original measure; and thus, almost two
years after Owen had made his first futile attempt, an almost
unanimous House voted to end the joint occupancy that had
existed since 1818 in the Oregon country.
Unfortunately for a prompt disposal of the problem, the
Senate required another two months' debate before acting. Dur-
ing February and March the crisis grew more serious. The
protracted discussion in the upper house kept the nation in
constant apprehension of war. The disclosure that Polk had
twice refused arbitration led to one scare; reports of an in-
crease in British armaments precipitated another. New fears
were raised late in March by the executive's recommendation
that Congress strengthen the country's defences. About the

he urged a settlement along the 49th parallel with Vancouver
Island and free navigation of the Columbia for ten years being

would submit the offer to the upper house for advice is not
certain. At that time, however, he was informing Burns to
prepare sentiment at home for such a contingency.

On the

on the cabinet at Westminister. As might have been expected,
however, nothing came of his personal intervention. Prime
Minister Peel declined to see him, and Lord Aberdeen, Minis-
ter for Foreign Affairs, granted him but a single interview.
Although he cited his son as the authority for many of his state-
ments, the Welsh reformer was brusquely informed that he
brought no information not possessed by Her Majesty's govern-
ment and "that no public advantage would arise from Mr.
Owen's authorized interference in the matter."
22
While the elder Owen was vainly cooling his heels at White-
hall, his son was participating in the final disposition of the
Oregon question. On April 16, 1846, the House resolution was
passed by the Senate, so amended as to be unrecognizable. In-
stead of a "notice" being required of the president, the matter
was now left to the discretion of that officer. The measure which
Polk had envisaged as a blunt statement terminating joint
occupancy was now enacted in the pacific hope
that the attention of the governments of both countries may be the
more earnestly and immediately directed to renewed efforts for the
amicable settlement of all their differences and disputes in respect to
said territory.
23
Owen, as we have seen, was no 54 40' die-hard. Only a day
before the House turned to the Senate's handiwork he helped
to persuade his chamber to be moderate on some other Oregon
legislation.

The amended "notice," however, he considered
vacillating and unsatisfactory. On a visit to the White House on
the evening of April 17, he rejected the president's argument
that any "notice" would do and declined to heed the executive's

vindicated the wisdom of the policy urged by him in 1844, and
he was sufficiently realistic to appreciate the extent of England's
surrender. He had been cautious enough, too, not to commit
himself irretrievably to 54 40'. On August 6 some remarks

even remotely connected with the Mexican War has seldom
been equalled in Congressional annals. Incessant moral, per-
sonal, and partisan criticism characterized the debates. Patriots
felt their country was guilty of bullying, humanitarians de-
plored the extension of slave territory, demagogues exaggerated
the cost of the struggle. Most of all, politicians feared that a
glorious victory would benefit the party in power. Thus the
waste of national treasure, the hardships of the poor volunteers,
and the suffering of widows and orphans formed the staple of
countless speeches as Whig orators in both houses sought to
convince the nation that the war was both unholy and unjust.
Early in January 1847, when Whig obstructionist tactics
were at their peak, Owen rose to defend the Democratic record.
He first insisted that the annexation of Texas was amply justi-
fied by international law and that the war was traceable not to
Folk's military maneuvers but to Mexican politicians who,
having aroused national prejudices and animosities, feared to
receive the new American envoy. The peace terms, Owen be-
lieved, must cede sufficient Mexican soil to satisfy old claims
and indemnify the United States for the cost of the war. Spe-
cifically, he had in mind a boundary running along the Rio
Grande and the 32nd parallel to the Pacific, with Lower Cali-
fornia being included in the cession. Thus the Hoosier stood
half way between the Whigs who opposed further territorial
extension and the extreme Democrats who would acquire all
Mexico.3
Toward the exasperating Whig minority Owen was more
tolerant than Polk. He would reprove no man who, honestly
believing his country to be in the wrong, criticized the ad-
ministration, even though such criticism nerved the foe and
prolonged the war. But he would denounce as an enemy of
civilization those politicians who, with an eye to 1848, were
willing to sacrifice the nation's blood upon the "prostituted
altar of party.'

She must see us united, harmonious, conscious of the justice of our
cause, ready to put forth all our strength. Then, and thus, may she
be brought to terms. Then, and thus, may this appeal to arms, the
last, I trust, in which America shall ever be forced to engage, come
to a close; and the period at last arrive, when we may turn our swords
into ploughshares, and study war no more.4
For the remainder of Ms second term in Congress Owen main-
tained that position. Generally speaking, he gave consistent and
loyal support to the Democratic administration. To many re-
formers and old associates on both sides of the Atlantic who
did not appreciate the environment in which he had been living
for more than a decade, his course was disappointing, to some
even treasonous. A still greater surprise awaited them when
Folk's attempt to obtain peace caused to flare up anew, after
a quarter century of compromise, the divisive question of
slavery.
Before August 1846 slavery had played little part in Owen's
political career. Upon the few occasions he had touched the
subject, he had reflected his early training and contemporary
environment. Although a youthful admirer of Thomas Clark-
son, Owen had never been a rabid antislavery advocate. He
regarded the institution as a great moral evil, but neither in
the columns of The Free Enquirer nor as a Representative from
southwestern Indiana did he betray any sympathy for the
Garrisonians or the Lane Seminary rebels. At Indianapolis
and at Washington he joined in rebukes to abolitionists who
were bringing pressure on Congress to interfere with slavery
in the states, though he did help John Quincy Adams rescind
the "gag rule." In his speeches on Texas he expressed the
belief that gradual emancipation, in the Border States at least,
was only a few years distant and that economic factors would
eventually cause human bondage to disappear.

for more than a decade, his course was disappointing, to some
even treasonous. A still greater surprise awaited them when
Polk's attempt to obtain peace caused to flare up anew, after
a quarter century of compromise, the divisive question of
slavery.
Before August r846 slavery had played little part in Owen's
political career. Upon the few occasions he had touched the
subject, he had reflected his early training and contemporary
environment. Although a youthful admirer of Thomas Clark-
son, Owen had never been a rabid antislavery advocate. He
regarded the institution as a great moral evil, but neither in
the columns of The Free Enquirer nor as a Representative from
southwestern Indiana did he betray any sympathy for the
Garrisonians or the Lane Seminary rebels. At Indianapolis
and at Washington he joined in rebukes to abolitionists who
were bringing pressure on Congress to interfere with slavery
in the states, though he did help John Quincy Adams rescind
the "gag rule." In his speeches on Texas he expressed the
belief that gradual emanicipation, in the Border States at least,
was only a few years distant and that economic factors would
eventually cause human bondage to disappear.5

The determination of James K. Polk to obtain a generous
slice of Mexican soil at the conclusion of the war brought the
erstwhile radical reformer face to face with the question of
extending slavery into the federal territories. With character-
istic realism the chief executive understood that no Mexican
president or general could sign a treaty ceding the northern
provinces unless plentifully supplied with money. Following
Jefferson's precedent of 1803, Polk requested from Congress on
August 8 an appropriation sufficient to cover the preliminary
steps in making peace.

Saturday the eighth was extremely hot and muggy, a typical
August day in Washington. As if realizing that the capital was
no fit place for human beings at such a season, Congress had
set its final adjournment for the following Monday. To the
usual frantic excitement attendant upon the close of a long,
seven-month session was now added the president's mysterious
request for money. Bewildered and suspicious, the lawmakers
discussed the proposal over their meal during the afternoon
recess. With Owen were two fellow lodgers, Dunlap and Yost,
and David Wilmot who had sat almost directly behind the In-
dianan during the session. Wilmot, the only Pennsylvania
Democrat to vote for the Walker Tariff, expressed fear lest the
sum sought by the executive would be used to acquire new
slave states and thus destroy the balance so zealously guarded
since 1820. He felt obliged, therefore, to offer an amendment
prohibiting slavery in any territory obtained by the two-million-
dollar appropriation which had been reported to the House
just before the recess. Owen at once demurred. While sym-
pathizing with Wilmot's ultimate aim, he declared that to place
in a peace measure a reference to such a controversial subject
would defeat the very end the president sought. Wilmot recog-
nized the danger but, unlike the Hoosier, determined to place
principle before expediency. After dinner, without Owen's aid,

the Pennsylvanian and other antislavery Democrats drew up
the proviso that has since borne Wilmot's name.7
The ensuing debate on the Two Million Bill was one of the
most interesting in which Owen ever participated. The last
evening of the session attracted many visitors of both sexes
to the capital as well as such prominent personages as Buchanan,
Bancroft, and General Scott. Wilmot's amendment barring
slavery from all territories acquired with the appropriation un-
der discussion, introduced soon after the House reconvened,
caused the empty benches to fill at once and the Representatives
to compete eagerly for the opportunity to speak. With great
difficulty Owen obtained the floor, the first Democrat of the
Old Northwest to do so. Talking slowly and emphasizing every
word, he warned that a denial of the president's request would
be interpreted by the world as an expression of our intention
to whip a weaker neighbor into submission. In reply to re-
peated questions from the Whig side of the chamber, Owen
declared he was willing to purchase a suitable boundary, not
fight for it. Peace was now the main desideratum; for the
optimistic Hoosier, ignoring the imminent sectional conflict
over slavery, insisted that, once the Mexican imbroglio were
removed, there would be no more dangers on the political
horizon.

After a heated discussion, the Wilmot Proviso was added,

taken by tellers in the Committee of the Whole, most com-

sentatives from the free states to join the opposition. Although
the peace bill was thus burdened with what he considered an
extraneous matter, Owen voted for its ultimate passage. On

an acrimony unequalled in Congress since 1820. Owen took
no part in the furious debates that raged in the House, but he
was again faced with the problem of voting for or against a
new Wilmot Proviso. His decision was consistent with his past
action. When the measure was first before the House in Febru-

proposition, but for the peace bill as a whole when his opposition
had once more proved unavailing. The Senate, however, de-

to the lower branch with the antislavery section eliminated. On
March 3 the House again voted on the matter, and for the
third time in seven months Owen cast his ballot in a manner
that might cause him to be regarded as a defender of the pe-

In some cases, enraged antislavery papers went beyond the
bounds of both decency and sanity. In a much copied article
a correspondent of Greeley's Tribune attempted to show "How
It was Done." He attributed the vote of each opponent of the

in March,

spondent to impute not only baseless but absurd motives to public
men. ... It so happens that I voted, session before last, precisely
as I did last session. It happens, farther, that I never, in my life,
applied for any office in the gift of the Government. ... A little

man might be to domestic institutions, which the progress of im-
provement must soon sweep away. He merits not the name of a
Statesman, who seeks an object, however just, with a disregard of all
considerations of time or place.

Thus did Owen reconcile politics and reform on the slavery-
issue.
Paradoxical as it may seem, in an age distinguished by in-
numerable crusades to aid the common man, a member of
Congress found it difficult to participate in reform movements.

should be confined to a few functions and not touch the daily
life of the individual. The true arena for the reformer in politics
was the state legislature. There, and there only, could laws
be passed to abolish imprisonment for debt, to secure property
rights to married women, to curb intemperance, and to improve
facilities for education.

A freethinker in Congress had little opportunity to attest his
zeal for religious liberty. Only one item in that connection
worthy of mention came up during Owen's tenure. That was a
proposal to stop governmental appropriations for chaplains
officiating in the national legislature. Thanks to the persistency
and fearlessness of Owen's Presbyterian colleague, John Pettit,
a resolution to accomplish that purpose was introduced at the
beginning of each session. Though roundly abused by his
hypocritical colleagues as an infidel at war upon Christianity,
Pettit stuck to his guns. As to Owen, he remained aloof from
the debates, in which Frances Wright's name was bandied
about. On three occasions when the resolution was rejected
he was not compelled to record his vote. On a fourth, however,
he answered nay to the proposal that "Chaplains shall look to
members of the two houses of Congress for their compensation;
and that the United States shall not be liable for their salaries
or any part thereof."

Certainly the former editor of The
Free Enquirer did not show up too well on that slight test of
his liberalism.
In social reform as on the chaplain issue Owen acted with
caution. He was more justified in this case, perhaps; for the
"Other purely political issues, not mentioned in the text, in which Owen

opposite directions brought me to precisely the same point at last.
18
By keeping to the middle of the road, as advised by Paulding
and in accordance with his own interests, Owen gave offence to
at least one old associate. In 1836 George Henry Evans, sick
in body and discouraged by his inability to keep alive a radical
daily in New York City, had retired to a farm in New Jersey.
There he regained not only his health but also the agrarian
philosophy that he had learned from Thomas Skidmore in
1829 but which he had subordinated at that time to the educa-
tional theories of Owen and Frances Wright. Declaring every
citizen had an inherent right to a piece of land, Evans brought
forward a proposal for allowing actual settlers to stake out for
their own immediate use portions of the public domain. Gather-
ing a group of followers that included many of the old Working
Men's Party into a National Reform Association, Evans began
in March 1844 a new series of the Working Man's Advocate.
Quite naturally he turned to his former co-editor, already be-
coming an important figure in the national legislature, for
assistance in promoting his ideas. As early as January 1844
Owen had introduced a petition from Evans to dispose of Oregon
lands free to settlers, and five months later he presented a
formal request for a general homestead law.

Offering memorials in Congress and openly advocating free-
dom of the public lands meant two different things to Owen,
as Evans quickly discovered. Ever since the failure of the

little effect.... If you will permit me to advise, be moderate at
first, and deal with one subject at a time.... Truth never bursts
open the door, but knocks softly.... It is of great consequence to
know where we are going, before we set out; and my suggestion to
you is, never as a Legislator, or Philosopher, to lay down a principle
without following it out through all its consequences. In doing this,
I have nine cases in ten, found that two roads leading in exactly
opposite directions brought me to precisely the same point at last.18
By keeping to the middle of the road, as advised by Paulding
and in accordance with his own interests, Owen gave offence to
at least one old associate. In r836 George Henry Evans, sick
in body and discouraged by his inability to keep alive a radical
daily in New York City, had retired to a farm in New Jersey.
There he regained not only his health but also the agrarian
philosophy that he had learned from Thomas Skidmore in
r829 but which he had subordinated at that time to the educa-

curing social ills by giving individuals equal bits of real estate,
and among his property-conscious constituents the panacea of
the National Reformers excited little interest. Owen recognized
that cheap Western lands provided a potential safety-valve for
industrial America; but he did not labor the point, going no
further than recommending a graduation of sale prices. To a
member of the National Reform Association who had re-
quested his aid, public or private, in advancing Evans' plans,
the Hoosier replied.
Each man can only do a certain amount of good in this world. In
attempting too much, he often fails in that which he might actually
accomplish. In all the questions which came before Congress, I have
taken . . . that side which I considered to be in accordance with
just principles of human rights. If, so far as I have gone, I have gone
right, that is something ;
even if it should be thought I have -not gone
far enough.
20
In short, the Western Democrat declined to march under
Evans' banner.
Although disappointed by Owen's middle of the road policy,
Evans did not divulge the identity of his correspondent, whose
letter he printed. He held his peace until Owen's advocacy of
a bill giving Indiana 800,000 acres of the public domain in order
to complete the Wabash and Erie Canal seemed to indicate
hostility, not indifference, to free homesteads. In an extended
editorial headed "Robert Dale Owen" Evans regretfully placed
his old friend among the enemies of republican institutions and
human rights. He even went so far as to repeat the false Whig
charges that Owen's championing of the Canal Bill resulted
from a desire to benefit his own private property. Another mem-
ber of the old Working Men's party agreed, in a public letter,
that Evans had just cause for suspicion.

unanswerable justification for his vote. Evans replied that a

that the Western Democrat would yet assist the National Re-

new generation had arisen to carry on the work of socialism

impractical. Nor did his three winters spent in America from
1844 to J &47 serve any useful purpose. Yet with a filial respect
that was ever one of his most admirable traits, Owen gave

DURING his Congressional years Owen made one strenuous
effort to aid the common man. That was his work as legislative
proponent and Regent of the Smithsonian Institution. Today
we think of that worthy organization as learned rather than
popular, helpful to the student rather than to the layman. But
a century ago there were those who dreamed of and battled
vainly for a different use of the fortune left the United States
"to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men." One of these dreamers and fighters
was Robert Dale Owen.
By 1843 fourteen years had passed since James Smithson's
death and five since the United States had obtained his bequest
of $508,318.46. During that half decade not a single American
had been made wiser by Smithson's generosity for the simple
reason that Congress could not decide what kind of an "estab-
lishment" should be created. Some people wanted a national
university of graduate standing, though they could not agree
whether it should embrace divinity, medicine, and law or just
the sciences and the humanities. Some wanted an agricultural
experiment station, others a botanical garden, still others, an
art gallery. There were those who favored the founding of a
popular periodical of useful information, like the English Penny
Magazine. John Quincy Adams advocated a national observa-
tory; whereas Richard Rush suggested an organization that
would cooperate with the government in its scientific work,
correspond with learned societies abroad, print monographs

During his first winter at Washington Owen took no visible
interest in the problem of the Smithsonian legacy. Although
he became a corresponding member of the National Institute,
he did not participate in its much publicized meeting of April
1844, designed to promote the campaign to merge that body
with the non-existent Smithsonian.2
At that time the young
Congressman was too busy winning laurels with speeches on
Oregon, Texas, and the tariff to attend to a matter in which
his constituents had no interest. It was not until his return to
the capital in December 1844 that the Western Democrat began
his efforts to enact James Smithson's will into law. It was prob-
ably his liberal friend and former "mess-mate" Benjamin Tap-
pan who called his attention to the subject; for only a few days
after his arrival, Owen was writing to Van Buren, requesting
permission to use the ex-president's name as Director in the
Smithsonian bill that the Ohio Senator intended to introduce

man.4
Tappan's highly utilitarian scheme proved very un-

in Congress or had access to the columns of the leading
newspapers. In the Senate the chief foe was Rufus Choate who

willing to accept a few minor items in the Ohioan's proposal,
the brilliant Whig orator from Massachusetts eloquently urged
an entirely different project, the expenditure of $20,000 an-
nually to build a national library, equal in quality if not in
quantity to any in the world. The Senator deplored the lack
of great collections in the United States, the absence of which,
he thought, justified the taunts so frequently made by foreigners
of our cultural backwardness. He felt that a Smithsonian Li-
brary would not only increase knowledge effectively but also
wipe away the stigma of inferiority.
5
Thanks to Choate's stirring appeal to patriotic pride and to
the prevalent fear that a national university would waste money
on expensive professorships, the library plan won immediate
and widespread approval. Neither Tappan's followers, who
thought it undemocratic, nor the friends of the National Insti-
tute, who regretted the lack of attention to science, could
prevent its passage in the Senate. Owen was equally dis-
appointed. So long as $20,000, almost the entire annual in-
come, was to be used for the purchase of books, there would
be little money left for functions that would more directly
diffuse knowledge.
6
In order to obtain a juster compromise
between the conflicting views, Owen drew up a substitute
measure to present to the House.
Given Owen's previous experience in the East in educating
adult workingmen through cheap tracts and popular lectures,
and given his first-hand acquaintance with the backward state
of agricultural and common school instruction in the West, the
new bill was certain to be more democratic and lay more em-
phasis on the diffusion of learning than that of the aristocratic
Choate. The sections dealing with finances and administration
were taken from Tappan's draft, as were provisions for scien-
tific cabinets and horticultural experiments. The significant
alteration came where the preamble of the Senate draft declared

of our cultural backwardness. He felt that a Smithsonian Li-
brary would not only increase knowledge effectively but also
wipe away the stigma of inferiority.5
Thanks to Choate's stirring appeal to patriotic pride and to
the prevalent fear that a national university would waste money
on expensive professorships, the library plan won immediate
and widespread approval. Neither Tappan's followers, who
thought it undemocratic, nor the friends of the National Insti-
tute, who regretted the lack of attention to science, could
prevent its passage in the Senate. Owen was equally dis-
appointed. So long as $zo,ooo, almost the entire annual· in-
come, was to be used for the purchase of books, there would
be little money left for functions that would more directly
diffuse knowledge.6 In order to obtain a juster compromise
between the conflicting views, Owen drew up a substitute
measure to present to the House.
Given Owen's previous experience in the East in educating
adult workingmen through cheap tracts and popular lectures,
and given his first-hand acquaintance with the backward state
of agricultural and common school instruction in the West, the
new bill was certain to be more democratic and lay more em-
phasis on the diffusion of learning than that of the aristocratic
Choate. The sections dealing with finances and administration
were taken from Tappan's draft, as were provisions for scien-
tific cabinets and horticultural experiments. The significant
alteration came where the preamble of the Senate draft declared
"Cong. Globe, 28 Cong., 2 Sess., Appendix, 62-65 (Jan. 8, 1845). Cf.

that "an ample and well-selected public library" was a most
effectual way to increase and diffuse knowledge. To this Owen
added a coordinate statement that "judiciously conducted com-
mon schools" were equally important in achieving that end.
The Indianan then reduced the yearly expenditure on books
from $20,000 to $12,000 and authorized the appointment, among
others, of a professor of common school instruction. Another
important addition provided for the occasional publication by
the Institution at cost price of essays, pamphlets, or magazines
for the dissemination of useful scientific knowledge.

The ensuing failure in the House of Owen's amended bill was
due chiefly to John Quincy Adams. Although the measure had
apparently the approval' of both Choate and Tappan and al-
though a special evening meeting was arranged for its considera-
tion, it was postponed and finally, on the last day of the session,
cast aside by the obstructionist tactics of the testy ex-president.
Adams confided exultingly to his diary that he had defeated
"a swindling Smithsonian bill"; but the press, without dis-
tinction of party, blamed him for his action.

he described Owen's "absurd amendment" and the desperate

or because of the more energetic and conciliatory tactics of
another, his assistance was no longer indispensable. With Tap-
pan, Choate, and Walker gone from the Senate, the initiative
fell to the lower house; and the leadership there was provided
not by John Quincy Adams but by Robert Dale Owen.
Late in the summer of 1845 Owen prepared for another at-
tempt to enact Smithson's bequest into law. From his brother
Dale, an able draftsman, a trained student of chemistry and
medicine, and one of the nation's outstanding geologists, he
obtained interior and exterior sketches for the building of the
future institution. He probably discussed, too, with his brother
Richard the latter's proposal, published five years before in the
South-Western Sentinel, to use the legacy to found a national
normal school.

Returning to Washington, Owen early in De-
cember introduced a new bill which, at his request, was referred
to a select committee of which he was named chairman. Favor-
able press notices from both parties gave reason to hope that
success was at hand. The Whig national organ, for instance, was
delighted to see the matter brought up at the beginning of the
session "under the auspices of so influential a member." Only
the correspondent of The North American, who had previously
ridiculed the work of Tappan and Walker, tried to arouse preju-
dices against the measure.

February, was now reduced to $5,000. A normal school of

With George P. Marsh of Vermont, to whom fell the mantle
formerly worn by Choate as champion of a big library, he
sought to restore the $20,000 annual appropriation for books;
but only a $5,000 increase could be obtained. One important
victory for the ex-president, however, was an amendment in-
vesting the Board of Managers with all the powers, duties, and
liabilities of a corporation. This change, which Owen disliked
and which was to cause more protest in the House than any
other provision, succeeded only because Sims, a Calhoun man,
voted for it against his true convictions in order to make the
entire act unacceptable to the Southern Democrats.13
Consideration of Owen's measure in the House awaited the
disposition of the Oregon resolution. The Indianan finally
opened the debate on April 22, 1846, with a detailed history
of the bequest. He defended his own bill as incorporating most
of the features suggested in the past for the new institution.
He attacked Choate's scheme as contrary to Smithson's in-
tentions and, because of the large sum allotted to books, fatal
to any scientific activity. A huge library at Washington he re-
garded as aristocratic, designed for a few local or wealthy biblio-
maniacs. In his opinion the money could be most advanta-
geously utilized to remove inequalities among its citizens,
especially inequality of education. A national normal school,
supplementing but not replacing those in the several states,
would do much to further uniform teaching. "I hold it to be a
democratic duty," said the Hoosier, "to elevate . . . the char-
acter of our common school instruction. I hold this to be a far
higher and holier duty than to give additional depth to learned
studies, or supply curious authorities to antiquarian research.'

In the improvement of primary education, the advancement of

Whether Owen's prominence in championing the bill
retarded its progress was a matter on which commentators
could not agree, but at least one editor and his Washington
correspondent professed to believe that the proposed measure
was a diabolical plot to spread Fourierism throughout the
land.
17
The general hostility manifested towards Owen's draft made
modifications inevitable. The voting on April 29 resulted in a
victory for the "big library" advocates. Owen's most novel
contribution, the national normal school, was badly beaten. A
substitute measure, drawn up by Owen's friend William J.
Hough of New York would have met a similar fate if the pro-
visions for professorships, experimental research, and the pub-
lication of cheap tracts had not been eliminated. When the
Committee of the Whole finished its work, Owen's bill had been
shelved and Hough's substitute burdened with a section appro-
priating $25,000 annually for books, a sum exceeding even
that demanded by Choate the previous year. Owen was thus
confronted with the unhappy alternative of voting for a
measure he obviously disliked or, by opposing it, of delaying
for another year, at least, the execution of the will of the
English philanthropist. To his credit, the Indianan did not
hesitate. Turning to a fellow member, he declared his inten-
tion to support the amended version. This he did, and by a
margin of seven ballots the House for the first time passed an
act establishing a Smithsonian Institution.
18
In the Senate procrastination was the chief obstacle to suc-
cess. Although reported with some changes by a committee
early in June, the measure was not considered, despite prompt-
ings from the press, until two days before adjournment. Even
then it was immediately laid aside lest debate over the changes

The complete triumph of Choate's plan was apparent in the

concerning lectures, obligatory scientific research, or the pub-

Institution was the formation of a library, and for that almost
the entire annual revenue might be used.

of the House to accept Owen's favorite proposals does not
deprive him of all claim to being a founder. In form, phrase-

of the establishment could have satisfied a majority in Con-
gress, and the main problem in 1846 was to get some bill passed.

Three weeks after the end of the long eight-month Congres-
sional session, Owen was again in Washington to take up his
new duties. At noon on an exceedingly hot seventh day of
September, 1846, he and twelve other Regents assembled in
the General Post Office Building, closed the doors to all visi-
tors, and sat for some hours discussing the vague instrument
with which they were to increase and diffuse knowledge among
men. Owen quickly proved to be one of the most industrious
and influential of the governors. He was placed on an Executive
Committee of three entrusted with control of the Institution's
finances. He was made chairman of a sub-committee raised "to
digest a plan to carry out the provisions of the act." He prob-
ably had as much as any other one man to do with the final
selection of the site of the new organization, the Mall between
Twelfth and Fourteenth Streets. When the Regents turned to
the problem of a Smithsonian building, Owen was ready with
the plans drawn up by Dale the previous summer. This design,
together with an earlier one by Robert Mills, was referred to
Owen and four others who were authorized to take steps "for
the erection of buildings fulfilling all the conditions ... in the
law organizing this institution." Accordingly, Owen and two
of his colleagues made a tour late in September of the important
Eastern cities, examining public edifices, consulting prominent
architects, and inquiring into proper construction materials,
styles, and methods of heating, lighting, and ventilation. Owen
kept a daily record of this investigation and submitted it as an
appendix to a subsequent report.

In the important task of selecting a permanent Secretary,
Owen played an equally prominent role. Since the scope of the
Institution's activity was still undetermined and since the
Regents were necessarily a transitory and untrained group,
the success of Smithson's bequest might depend largely on this
choice. Owen realized that fact and wrote in his first report that
the office of Secretary must ... be regarded, not as one to be filled
by any man capable to act as recording clerk, or to receive with
politeness, the visitors of the Institution ... but as an office on the
due administration of. which the executive efficiency of our Institution
at home and its reputation abroad, mainly depend. . . ,

Among the applicants for the position were Francis Markoe,

Owen's
choice seems to have been Joseph Henry, distinguished for his
research in physics and then professor at the College of New
Jersey, or at least a man of similar caliber. Before the election
took place he suggested that the future Secretary "possess
qualifications of a professor of the highest standing" (thus
excluding Markoe, Pickering, and Brodhead) and then for-
mally resolved that he be a man "capable of advancing science
and promoting letters by original research." Other evidence,
less trustworthy, also indicates that Owen and his friends pre-
ferred the Princeton scholar.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 231
Even before Henry's selection Owen had submitted, as re-
quested by his colleagues, a plan to carry out the law creating
the Institution. The vague provisions of the charter and a
general misapprehension by the public at large as to the pur-
pose of the establishment made the document both necessary
and important. Owen's report of Dec. i, 1846, followed the
same broad, democratic lines as his earlier bills and speeches.
While fulfilling every specific requirement of the statute, it
reintroduced certain items previously eliminated by Congress,
such as the permanent professorships, the experimental farms,
and the conservatories, as well as several sweeping statements
reminiscent of the much disliked national normal school. It is
difficult to escape the conclusion that Owen was trying to reverse
in the smaller committee the defeats he had suffered in the legis-
lature the previous April.
28
Owen's plan of organization met the same fate in the Board
of Regents as had his earlier bill in Congress. It was too demo-
cratic. On the very day that Henry entered upon his new
duties, it was returned to the committee. When it reappeared
a month later, still under Owen's name, the conservatories,
botanical gardens, and farms were eliminated; all mention of a
permanent faculty was omitted; and the references to the
interest which the Institution was to take in "the theory and
practice of public education" were reduced from three to one.
The sections dealing with the building, the museum, the scien-
tific cabinets, and the art gallery were left largely as Owen had
designed. The completely equipped chemical laboratory, prob-
ably the suggestion of David Dale Owen, was retained, though
not under the supervision of a regular professor. The plan for
lectures outside of the capital was greatly restricted. The chief
additions to the report consisted of specific methods of increas-
ing and diffusing knowledge. The former was to be accom-
plished by awarding annual premiums for original papers and
by grants to scholars for definite research projects. Knowledge
was to be disseminated by brief, popular publications, similar

Knowledge, by annual reports containing a record of the year's
discoveries and inventions, and by free lectures. The last were
to emphasize the physical sciences, the useful arts, agriculture,
and public education.29
This revised report, together with a series of resolutions
by Rufus Choate, also a Regent, became the basis for the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution during its first years.
Several men deserve the credit for the result. Choate had
successfully removed all semblances of a national university
but had not founded the great library he so desired. Henry was
responsible for the specific methods of increasing and diffusing
knowledge. Owen's contributions were the chemical labora-
tory, the provision for cheap publications, and the definition
of the type of lectures to be delivered. These last were de-
scribed in words identical to those in his bill of December
1845. The compromise character of this revised report of
January 1847 was seen in the accompanying resolutions which
made permanent appropriations from the annual income.
Each year the sum of $15,000 was to be used for the purchase
of books, the maintenance of the museum, and the payment of
half of Henry's salary. The remainder, or slightly more than
that figure, was to go for publications, premiums, lectures, and
the other half of the Secretary's stipend. In brief, it was a
compromise in which Owen, Choate, and even Henry for the
time, felt constrained to acquiesce.

All through the short session of his second term Owen spent
much, perhaps too much, of his time on Smithsonian affairs.

Treasury from paying any money to the Institution until the
war was ended. In the press it was inaccurately asserted that
the governors were violating the charter by refusing to report
to the national legislature and by spending part of their funds
on a building. In Washington a rumor that convict labor was
to be used in constructing the edifice aroused the local working-
men to protest.
35
As so often happened, these unfounded criticisms stung the
sensitive Owen into a public reply.
36
But there is no evidence
that in the spring of 1847 the Indianan regretted the time he
had devoted to the Smithsonian Institution. Nor did he betray
any disappointment that his wishes had not been followed to the
letter. He was probably satisfied by the realization that, up to
that time, no other individual had more influenced the develop-
ment of the Institution. Certainly no other Regent had been
more industrious. If the work had dealt with a subject in

war was ended. In the press it was inaccurately asserted that
the governors were violating the charter by refusing to report
to the national legislature and by spending part of their funds
on a building. In Washington a rumor that convict labor was
to be used in constructing the edifice aroused the local working-
men to protest.35
As so often happened, these unfounded criticisms stung the
sensitive Owen into a public reply.36 But there is no evidence
that in the spring of 1847 the Indianan regretted the time he
had devoted to the Smithsonian Institution. Nor did he betray
any disappointment that his wishes had not been followed to the
letter. He was probably satisfied by the realization that, up to
that time, no other individual had more influenced the develop-
ment of the Institution. Certainly no other Regent had been
more industrious. If the work had dealt with a subject in
which his constituents were not vitally interested, it had, at
least, won him new friends, even among political opponents.
It had helped him, moreover, to become a national figure.

were simple yet extraordinarily clever. Hoping to attract

the tariff, the status of slavery in the federal territories, and
the expediency of voting supplies to continue the war, the
judge carefully hedged. It was no part of his plan to contrast
himself with his more talented opponent but rather to align
Owen's personality against Taylor's. The former was to be
portrayed as a British aristocrat, a notorious infidel, and an
inveterate spoilsman, who ignored the needs of the common
soldier, wasted his time on a useless Smithsonian Institution,
and, worst of all, voted at the president's bidding to deprive
gallant Whig generals of their high command.1
Although the excessive cost of the war, the valiant exploits
of Zachary Taylor, and the pitiable lot of widows and orphans
constituted the chief staple of Embree's speeches, the Hoosier's
record in Congress did not escape close scrutiny. Three matters
were singled out for special criticism and distortion. One was
an early vote against a poorly drawn bill to increase the pay
of the volunteer, a vote that was amply justified but so easily
misrepresented that all through the canvass the Western Demo-
crat was depicted as the enemy of the poor soldier.

Owen's sudden approval, after three times opposing, of an act
to create a lieutenant general superior to Scott and Taylor
was given undue emphasis and construed to mean that the
Representative of the First District followed orders from the
White House rather than the dictates of his own conscience.
When this ostensible truckling to the executive was coupled
with the bountiful patronage that the Owen family received
early in 1847, ^e Whigs were able to build up a plausible
case of bargain and corruption. It made little difference that
Owen had later championed salary increases for the army, had
several times refused to comply with Folk's wishes, and had
suggested no one for appointments who was not well qualified.

cratic Clarion, June 12, 26, July 10, 1847. A complete file of that paper and

his heterodox opponent, but he was not blind to the possibil-

their leader. Long before such problems as the war and patron-
age had arisen, Embree was discussing with friends "the proper
mode of attacking Owen" and had formulated a plan by which
"he might be beaten . . . without any great sacrifice of time
or money." This method, later described as "arduous and
disagreeable," was called to the judge's attention again on the
eve of the canvass, and in the following weeks was carried into
effect by the simple means of having Embree read on the stump
selected passages from The Free Enquirer* It is doubtful
whether these agnostic sentiments, worn threadbare since 1836,
greatly shocked the electors, but they did cause their author
rather stupidly at public meetings to waste valuable time in
explanation that more profitably could have been allotted to
other matters.

did not determine the outcome, for equally important was the
feeling that the incumbent had served long enough. A desire
for rotation in office and the distorted charge of nepotism were

Defeat brought to Owen keen disappointment and wounded
pride. He realized that his future in national politics was seri-

of inferior ability, one whom he described to his father as
"equally without talent & without principle." He knew only
too well the hollowness of Embree's non-partisan pretensions;
and he might have foreseen that the Chandler brothers, whose
Evansville Journal had so violently assailed the numerous
appointments of the Owen family, would themselves be among
the most persistent applicants for office from the district under
the new dispensation. The vanquished had to glean what satis-

sentative on those matters. Then, too, political issues alone
did not determine the outcome, for equally important was the
feeling that the incumbent had served long enough. A desire
for rotation in office and the distorted charge of nepotism were
vital factors, and the sagacious Chapmans placed their finger
on another fundamental cause when they blamed their followers
in the "Pocket" for deserting their candidate at the polls in-
stead of denying him renomination in the first place.10
Defeat brought to Owen keen disappointment and wounded
pride. He realized that his future in national politics was seri-
ously threatened. He honestly believed he had lost to a man
of inferior ability, one whom he described to his father as
"equally without talent & without principle." He knew only
too well the hollowness of Embree's non-partisan pretensions;
and he might have foreseen that the Chandler brothers, whose
Evansville Journal had so violently assailed the numerous
appointments of the Owen family, would themselves be among
the most persistent applicants for office from the district under
the new dispensation. The vanquished had to glean what satis-
faction he could in the admission of Greeley's Indiana corre-
spondent that the erstwhile reformer had been the state's
"most talented and ... gentlemanly Loco-Foco in Congress"
and in the sorrow expressed by Ritchie in the national party

Richard Rush's departure for Paris as our new minister might

vestiges were removed of the Institution's concern with the
needs of the common man. Starting mildly in 1848, Henry
became each year more and more insistent that no cheap tracts

the increase rather than the diffusion of knowledge. Finally,

Henry, in his zeal to promote science, had not violated the en-

Marsh. Owen, whose desire for a democratic, educational estab-

upon by both sides. The disciples of Choate blamed him for
minimizing in his plan of organization in December 1846 the

on the other hand, behaved much more candidly. They gave
an unusually full summary of the Democrat's speeches and
praised him for his fairness. They doubted, however, the ex-

Owen's canvass in 1848 was the most extended and difficult
he had ever undertaken. Before the local elections in August,
he confined his activity to the First District; but on Septem-

well over a thousand miles, through more than half the coun-
ties of the state, to meet some fifty scheduled appointments.

November brought Owen another defeat. Although Cass
received Indiana's twelve electoral votes, Taylor won hand-
somely in the nation. A federal appointment was thus out of
the question for Owen for another four years. Cass, moreover,
was only a minority victor in the Hoosier state as Van Buren
more than quadrupled Birney's poll of i844.
29
Thus did the
free soil issue continue to loom ominously upon the horizon as
the Western Democrat turned his thoughts to the election of
another United States Senator.
When the legislature convened at Indianapolis in December
1848, Owen's party had a clear majority. The very size of that
majority, however, encouraged the impotent Whigs and Free
Soilers to fish in troubled waters, to throw their support to a
moderate Democrat on the condition he would espouse the
Wilmot Proviso.
30
Accordingly, on the eve of the caucus, each
Senatorial candidate was publicly asked, first, whether he be-
lieved Congress possessed the power to prohibit slavery in the
newly acquired territories and, second, whether he, if elected,
would vote for such a prescriptive act. The replies exceeded
the fondest hopes of the Free Soilers. Although but a few
months before, all Cass men had dismissed the Proviso as hum-
bug, most of the aspirants now answered both questions in
the affirmative. Owen alone remained consistent. In a letter
twice as long as any rival's, he acknowledged Congress's author-
ity to keep slavery out of California and New Mexico, but his
sole concession to free soil demands was a promise to introduce
into the Senate a joint resolution declaring the existing free
status of those territories. Such a resolution, he thought, would
be as effective as Wilmot's and much more likely to pass.

as well as his control of the patronage and unwilling to jump
on the free soil bandwagon, Owen stood a poor second.
32
There
was, to be sure, a distant possibility that one of the defeated
candidates might rally enough Whigs, Free Soilers, and dis-
contented Democrats to upset the caucus choice; but Owen
was not the man for that job. By sacrificing expediency to
consistency on the Wilmot Proviso, he had precluded support
from the antislavery bloc; while the Whigs had no reason to
regard him as other than a regular party man. In fact, in both
1842 and in 1845 Owen had been extremely loyal to the voice
of the caucus. Now, once again, he refused to let his name go
before the Assembly. As a result, Whitcomb was easily
elected.
33
By the close of 1848 Owen's political progress had come to
a definite halt. Beaten twice in four Congressional contests,
he could hardly expect the nomination in 1849. His third un-
successful bid for Senator made it clear that the united support
of the "Pocket" delegation was not enough to bring victory.
Perhaps if his party returned to a more conservative position on
the slavery issue, Owen's chances for promotion in the future
would be better. But in December 1848 there was no indica-
tion of such a change. On the contrary, in the next few months
the free soil tendencies among Hoosier Democrats continued
to grow.
34
Thus the only consolation left to Owen was the
realization that he had acted honorably, placing principle above
opportunism. Even the Whigs were forced to admit that his
course had been "entirely consistent," not exhibiting "that
change of opinion (adopted to suit existing circumstances)
which characterized the course of the other gentlemen." The

INTELLECTUAL CURRENTS
FOR twelve years before 1849 national and state politics con-
stituted the chief subject of Owen's actviity, thought, and
aspirations. He devoted the very best part of his life to a
public career, not for the spoils of office though Owen was
the first to admit a natural ambition for influence and pres-
tige but because it provided an arena in which he could most
easily employ his varied accomplishments. Business he dis-
liked; and journalism, for which he was admirably suited,
seems to have lost its appeal. The professions were of course
closed by his lack of adequate training. Both reformers and
writers, roles which Owen filled at other periods, still found
their trades unprofitable in mid-century Indiana. Public service,
on the other hand, was better paid and more highly esteemed
then than now. Especially in the West did the ablest men seek
government positions, and in following that path Owen saw
an opportunity both to benefit his neighbors and to dissipate
among them the prejudices engendered by his youthful radi-
calism. The reverses of 1847 and 1848, therefore, did not
destroy his political ambitions, though they tended to make
him bolder and more independent. They did, however, initiate
a brief interlude in which other interests came momentarily
to the fore and during which we can best study the intellectual
currents of his Indiana years.
While Owen was busy with public affairs at Indianapolis and
Washington, changes were taking place in his village home.

were extremely congenial, and the hospitality with which they
greeted visitors to their dramatic performances, balls, and
Fourth of July festivities became a byword throughout the
"Pocket." Three private libraries were freely patronized, a
mutual instruction society stimulated adult education, while
the laboratory and museum of David Dale Owen were virtually
unrivalled west of the mountains. The influence of the Owenite
community was reflected in the public celebration of Tom
Paine's birthday, the lax observance of the Sabbath, and the
absence, before 1850, of any church building. A residue of
radicalism made possible an exotic and impotent Free Land
Association and gave mild encouragement to Josiah Warren's
"Time Store"; but by and large the exponents of socialism
found New Harmony barren ground.
1
The pressure of public affairs quite naturally compelled Owen
to play a lesser part in village life during these years than he
had in those immediately following his marriage. From De-
cember 1836 until June 1853 he was away from home fully
half of the time. Thus nothing more was heard of his jockey
clubs or acting before the Thespian Society. He did not join
the New Harmony Sons of Temperance; he ignored the free
land group, avoided the Paine anniversary dinners, and appar-
ently manifested indifference to the "Time Store.
77
This aloof-
ness inevitably drew criticism from those who had an axe to
grind, but little of it was justified.

Considering the extent of
Owen's public activity and obligations, he did a great deal to
benefit his village. If there was a patriotic oration to be de-
livered, a social gathering to be addressed, or a few appropriate
words to be spoken to school children, he was always called
upon. He lectured frequently and without pay to local organi-

That they weathered the storm unshaken is proof palpable of
the depth of their convictions.
Financially Owen did not prosper in these years. Mention
has already been made of the difficulties that prompted the
respite from politics in 1841. During the next two years Owen
liquidated all the joint family mercantile enterprises that had
come down from the "community days," and he bluntly assured
his father that the brothers would never again engage in such
business. Twelve months later he welcomed his sire to New
Harmony with the warning that "you will find us all doing
well here . . .
except making money."

For the next few
years, however, his eight-dollar-a-day salary as Congressman
relieved Owen of pecuniary worry, and in 1848 he paid the
last of the mortgage to D'Arusmont. After that date the source
and extent of his income are less certain. He still owned a con-
siderable amount of land about New Harmony from which he
received rents, and in 1849 he and Dale realized about $10,000
from the sale of Cut-Off Island. During 1851 and 1852 he
again received a stipend from public office, but that was transi-
tory. His property itself brought less than $1,500 a year,
and this continued shrinkage caused Owen to be concerned
over his financial status until his death.

or by his already widely accepted reputation as a scholar is
not clear, but there is no doubt that the recipient welcomed
the honor for the prestige it carried. His appointment, how-

subjected to the jealous competition of denominational colleges
throughout the state, was in grave danger of being stillborn.

Owen's address to the people marked the turn of the tide.
Early in 1841 the legislative investigating committee placed
its stamp of approval on both the policy of the Trustees and
the opinions expressed in their manifesto. By autumn the
university's attendance had begun to rise. Owen himself was
rewarded by being one of the few Trustees who were reappointed
when the Board was shaken up and abbreviated.

during the next decade the Western Democrat devoted con-
siderable spare time to the welfare of the institution. In the
fall of 1846, finding the burden of Congressman and Smithsonian
Regent sufficient, he resigned as Trustee; but two years later,
when again free, he was rechosen. In the subsequent move-
ment to remedy Indiana's earlier neglect of her common schools
by appropriating for their use the university's funds, Owen was
found on the correct though less popular side of higher educa-
tion. Although he resigned as Trustee again at the end of
1851, he continued to render valuable services at both Indian-
apolis and Washington; and it was not until his departure for
distant climes in the summer of 1853 that the tie with Bloom-
ington finally snapped.

future home, Owen proposed to the Regents that the Secre-
tary and the Building Committee prepare a small volume that
would satisfy public curiosity concerning the unfamiliar design
and placate the dissatisfied competitors who thought that the
rejected plans had not received sufficient publicity. Subsequent
resolutions expanded the undertaking into "a treatise on archi-
tecture/' but one that would be popular in character. The very
fact that in March 1847 Owen himself was requested to be the
author limited the profundity of the work and gave assurance
that it would seek to diffuse rather than to increase knowledge.
Why the Indianan was selected for the task is far from clear;
the most probable reason is that no other Regent was willing

Two years were to elapse before Owen's essay on architec-

the printer encountered in preparing the expensive wood-cut
illustrations and in part from the political activity of the West-

winter of leisure between the disastrous Embree contest and the
extended stumping tour for Lewis Cass, it is hard to see how
the book would have been put before the public even in May
1849. But the loss of Owen the politician was the gain of
Owen the intellectual, and during 1847 and 1848 he benefited
from frequent contacts with artists like Robert Mills, James
Renwick, and Ashur B. Durand. In that same period he was
compelled to read widely, if not deeply, and the result was

Finally, it must seek to employ as ornament the natural prod-
ucts of the land. Latrobe's "happy inspiration" in outlining
stalks and ears of Indian corn on the shafts and capitals of the
pillars in the vestibule of the Senate illustrated what Owen had
in mind. The Hoosier believed that the commendable achieve-
ments in American painting and sculpture gave promise of an
equally bright future in architecture.

may, as a whole, serve as a suitable model for us, now in this nine-

inquiry presents itself, may we not hope to see spring up in our
midst, a school of our own; assimilated, more or less, to one or other
of the old manners; yet asserting its privilege to originate as well as
to adopt, . . ?

This clarion call for a native style, suited to the needs of
republican America and based on the late Norman and early
Gothic, met with little response in subsequent architectural
development. The Smithsonian Building did not inaugurate, as
Owen had hoped, a series of similar edifices. From the beginning
its critics were as numerous as its admirers, and since the disas-
trous fire of 1865 it has generally been considered one of the
capital's least attractive edifices.
19
When a creative spirit was
finally breathed into American architecture after the Civil War
by Henry Hobson Richardson, the Romanesque of southern
France, not the Norman or early Gothic, served as the model.
Yet Owen's message, if unheeded, was none the less significant.

teenth century and here on this North American continent, then the
inquiry presents itself, may we not hope to see spring up in our
midst, a school of our own; assimilated, more or less, to one or other
of the old manners; yet asserting its privilege to originate as well as
to adopt. . . ? 18
This clarion call for a native style, suited to the needs of
republican America and based on the late Norman and early
Gothic, met with little response in subsequent architectural
development. The Smithsonian Building did not inaugurate, as
Owen had hoped, a series of similar edifices. From the beginning
its critics were as numerous as its admirers, and since the disas-
trous fire of 1865 it has generally been considered one of the
capital's least attractive edifices.19 When a creative spirit was
finally breathed into American architecture after the Civil War
by Henry Hobson Richardson, the Romanesque of southern
France, not the Norman or early Gothic, served as the model.
Yet Owen's message, if unheeded, was none the less significant.

Except for beauty there was little justification for the Greek
revival in the United States, and an appeal for a style adapted
to and representative of our national needs and institutions was
not improper. Owen's dream has been shared by many since
his time; and even today there are those who readily admit
that the magnificent monuments of Washington reflect little
that is indigenous to America and who regard it as something
of an anomaly that the Great Emancipator, a humble son of
the frontier, should have as his memorial a Greek temple.
Owen's message not only went unheeded; it went largely un-

interested in hints on private dwellings than those on public
buildings. Thus, although the book was favorably commented
upon by a special committee of notables to whom it was sub-

primary cause for the dislike that the scientist seems to have
conceived for his former sponsor. For one thing the Secretary's
pride was hurt by the Hoosier's neglect in not consulting him,
as directed, in the preparation of the manuscript. The undue

"active operations" of which he was inordinately proud, and it
threatened to establish a precedent for the very thing he op-
posed popular works that would diffuse rather than increase
knowledge. Finally, Henry was distressed that, at a time when
he was striving to devote every dollar of a meager income to
what he considered the proper functions of the Institution, this
bastard treatment should consume more than double its original
appropriation. Inevitably Hints on Public Architecture must

Illinois and indifference in Missouri caused the abandonment
of that ambitious plan; but during the winter Owen continued
to spread the new gospel in the "Pocket" and finally decided,
characteristically enough, to diffuse through the printed page
all that he knew about this improved method of travel.
26
In origin and purpose Owen's new volume differed little from
his recent effort in the field of architecture. Just as the Build-
ing Committee of the Smithsonian Institution had commissioned
him to publish facts that the layman could not obtain in simple
form, so now Owen presented the data he collected in New
York and elsewhere because he could not refer his numerous
Western correspondents to a non-technical work on plank roads.
In form, the new treatise was less pretentious than Hints on
Public Architecture, and in content it was even less original.
The text was chiefly expository, with just enough appropriately
illustrated argument that "any farmer or teamster" could un-
derstand, to break down the existing prejudice against toll high-
ways. After briefly tracing the history of the new improvement,
the author described with minute detail the methods of con-
struction. Chapters were devoted to such topics as grading and
excavation; pertinent facts were given on costs, durability, and,
most important of all, on profits. Even a sample contract and
a list of tools required by a road gang were included. The book,
then, was essentially a manual with which intelligent men,
lacking previous experience and the services of a trained
engineer, would be able to lay down a plank road. As one
reviewer said of it, "Indeed we don't know but plank roads
will almost build themselves hereafter."
27
Although Owen's essay was neither original nor definitive,
it was both timely and useful. When it was first contemplated,
not a single authoritative description of plank roads could be

highways were opened in sparsely populated districts where
the traffic was too light to bring profits to the stockholders.
Even more disastrous was the inadequate nature of the materials
used. Wood afforded a surface sufficiently smooth and, if

CHAPTER XVII
THE INDIANA CONSTITUTION
As HE SCANNED the election returns in August 1849, Robert
Dale Owen found many grounds for satisfaction. In the First
District Embree had gone down to an unexpected and painful
defeat before an inexperienced rival. In the state the Democrats
had won their greatest victory since the "revolution" six years
before, thus dissipating once and for all the fear aroused in
1848 that the Free Soilers might come to hold a balance of
power. The removal of that danger greatly enhanced the In-
dianan's prospects in the Senatorial election of 1850, for it
enabled his party to return to its conservative position on
slavery. Yet, in the end, it was the well-nigh unanimous de-
mand of the voters for a new constitution that gave Owen the
most pleasure. As early as 1840 he had vainly suggested that
some change be made in the state's organic law. Not until
the end of the decade, when a wave of constitutional reform was
sweeping across the country, did the Hoosiers fall in line and
seek to bring their fundamental charter closer to the people.
1
Being widely regarded as one of Indiana's foremost citizens
and legislators, Owen was naturally urged to serve in the forth-
coming convention. Lacking for the moment more pressing
duties and being keenly aware of the tremendous importance
of such a body, he consented to run and in the summer of 1850
turned his attention from plank roads to constitutional prin-
ciples. Besides speaking at public meetings throughout Posey

CHAPTER XVII
THE INDIANA CONSTITUTION
As HE SCANNED the election returns in August 1849, Robert
Dale Owen found many grounds for satisfaction. In the First
District Embree had gone down to an unexpected and painful
defeat before an inexperienced rival. In the state the Democrats
had won their greatest victory since the "revolution" six years
before, thus dissipating once and for all the fear aroused in
1848 that the Free Soilers might come to hold a balance of
power. The removal of that danger greatly enhanced the In-
dianan's prospects in the Senatorial election of 1850, for it
enabled his party to return to its conservative position on
slavery. Yet, in the end, it was the well-nigh unanimous de-
mand of the voters for a new constitution that gave Owen the
most pleasure. As early as 1840 he had vainly suggested that
some change be made in the state's organic law. Not until
the end of the decade, when a wave of constitutional reform was
sweeping across the country, did the Hoosiers fall in line and
seek to bring their fundamental charter closer to the people.1
Being widely regarded as one of Indiana's foremost citizens
and legislators, Owen was naturally urged to serve in the forth-
coming convention. Lacking for the moment more pressing
duties and being keenly aware of the tremendous importance
of such a body, he consented to run and in the summer of 1850
turned his attention from plank roads to constitutional prin-
ciples. Besides speaking at public meetings throughout Posey
and the "Pocket,'' he encouraged the editors of the New Albany
Ledger, the Democratic daily in the state's largest city, to
commence a weekly journal devoted exclusively to topics suit-
able for inclusion in the new charter. Owen himself contributed

frequently to this Constitution, dealing for the most part with
a reform little discussed up to then, the legal emancipation of
married women. After an apparently uneventful canvass Owen
was elected in the Democratic landslide in August to represent
his own county.

Shortly before ten o'clock on Monday morning, October 7,
1850, nearly one hundred and fifty delegates crowded into the
specially arranged lower chamber in the State House. More
than four months later, on February 10, they adjourned sine
die in Masonic Hall, having completed the instrument that today
remains the organic law of Indiana. During that time they
discussed all matters of reform, resisted temptations to move
to other cities, survived a cholera scare, indulged in extraneous
political and personal debate, and, because of their extended
sitting, were subjected to incessant criticism from the press,
the General Assembly, and from their own number. While they
were in session, the state legislature met, a United States Sena-
tor was elected, and a movement begun to elevate a native son
to the presidency. In all of these matters Owen had a vital in-
terest; and thanks to the telegraph, the increased number of
newspapers, many of which were printed daily or tri-weekly,
and to the official publication of the proceedings, as much is
known about this phase of the Hoosier's career as almost any
other.
From the moment he moved its first act, the election of a
presiding officer, until he made the final report in the early
hours of February 10, Owen was the most diligent, prominent,
and influential delegate in the convention. To accord him that
primacy is not to minimize the parts played by such colleagues
as John Pettit and James Borden or such opponents as John
Niles and Schuyler Colfax but merely to register what the
contemporary documents reveal. It was not alone Owen's posi-
tion as leader of the dominant party that secured his preemi-
nence. Maturing years had brought balance" to his thought,

On all of these topics Owen voted with his party;
but, except on the bank issue where he strove earnestly for
conciliation, he exerted his influence more in the Committee on
Revision than on the floor itself.
6
Aside from extraneous political debate, buncombe, and the
bank question, most of the convention's time was consumed by
matters neither urgently demanded nor universally desired by
the electors in the preceding years. Three of these, homestead
exemption, the treatment of Negroes, and the property rights of
married women, came before Owen's standing committee and
shed, thereby, some light on his claim to being a reformer. The
first of these matters was eagerly sought among northern
Hoosiers. Despite an ever increasing acceptance in other states,
it was still considered a radical innovation in Indiana; and
Owen, while approving homestead exemption laws in the ab-
stract, doubted the wisdom of placing so bitterly disputed a
measure in the new charter. Since most of his constituents, as
well as his colleague from Posey, disliked the proposal, he was
inclined to leave it for disposition by the next session of the
legislature. Thus, although he fought valiantly for an un-
restricted statement prohibiting imprisonment for debt and
although he supported a general exemption clause, Owen twice
voted against exempting homesteads as well.

Given the repre-
sentative system of government, Owen's conservatism was not
censurable, but it was unwise. The same argument used by
him, that a radical reform should be decided upon by the
legislature rather than by a constituent assembly, could be and
was employed against his own favorite measure.

The rights of colored persons came before the convention in
two different forms. One was a referendum on the question of
Negro suffrage. Owen supported the proposal on the grounds
that it would give the minority a hearing and at the same time
effectively reveal to the abolitionists the paucity of their num-
bers; but his ballot was cast in vain.
8
The other form com-
prised a series of resolutions, reported by Owen, prohibiting
Negroes and mulattoes from settling in the state or purchasing
real estate therein, and these passed by an average vote of
two to one.
9
In thus writing into their new constitution a policy
of exclusion, the Hoosier legislators did not act, as radicals
often charged, through indifference or blind inhumanity. Men
like Owen, whose lives brought them into daily contact with
people residing on slave soil, could logically advocate exclusion
and still regard themselves as true friends of the colored race.
They argued that no body of people should live in a free coun-
try without possessing equal political and social rights. Since
there already existed a deep-seated prejudice, proper or im-
proper, against Negro equality and since some statutes already
made partial discriminations, Owen saw no reason not to go
the full length and separate the races completely. A liberal
policy of colonization linked to the new prohibition seemed to
him the best solution of a difficult problem. To be sure, this
dream of colonization, the usual defence for exclusion, was a
chimera as Owen himself later admitted. But it was a dream
indulged in by some of the ablest statesmen of the day.
10
In the months preceding the Constitutional Convention no
reform had attracted less attention among the people of In-
diana than civil equality for married women. Yet no subject
played a more prominent role in its proceedings. For that

Although often obscured by legal verbiage, the evil Owen
sought to eradicate is not difficult to understand. He wished a
married woman to retain before the law the identity she pos-
sessed before marriage. Specifically, wives should control their
own property, both that which they possessed when wed and
that which they acquired thereafter. The subject was not, to
be sure, a new one to Owen. As early as The Free Enquirer
days he had inveighed against the legal enslavement of married
women and, a few years later at Indianapolis, had made his
first efforts to modify by statute the rigors of the English
common law. In the ensuing decade he said little about the
matter, partly, perhaps, for political reasons but mostly because
he knew that his wishes could be carried into effect only by the
state legislature. During these ten years the change he advo-
cated, premature in 1837, was adopted in various forms in sev-
eral states, though only the youngest commonwealths wrote
the reform into their organic law. In 1847, without fanfare or
opposition, Indiana had granted married women the right to
devise property and to control their real estate, thereby placing
the Hoosiers about midway between the most liberal and the
most conservative states.

by which Blythe's amendment was adopted. His motion was
carried; and after another spell of personal insinuations and
theological dialectics, the cherished reform failed to repass.
16
Nowise discouraged, Owen a month later, on January 16, re-
ported a third version of his project; but this, after being, seem-
ingly, on the verge of acceptance, was voted down on January 29.
With the cup of victory again dashed from his lips, Owen might
well have given up the fight, but he did not. Less than a week
before the final adjournment, he won by a personal appeal the
right to present his plan in a fourth and still weaker form.
Amid general astonishment, it passed, and for the second time
the civil equality of married women was written into the new
Hoosier constitution.
17
There it did not long remain. That very afternoon, while
Owen was absent with the Committee on Revision, Milton
Gregg, veteran Whig editor and previously a staunch supporter
of the reform, moved a reconsideration of the morning's vote.
When the convention assembled the following day to act upon
the motion, rumors were current that Owen owed his last suc-
cess to chicanery. These stories he immediately and completely
refuted, but the tide had once more set against him. Whether
the delegates were influenced by sheer boredom or by the fact
that the measure, as Gregg later said, "had been frittered down
to a mere shadow, and, as it then stood, was of decidedly more
importance to the reputation of Mr. Owen, than of practical
utility to the women of Indiana" is not certain.

by which Blythe's amendment was adopted. His motion was
carried; and after another spell of personal insinuations and
theological dialectics, the cherished reform failed to repass.16
Nowise discouraged, Owen a month later, on January r6, re-
ported a third version of his project; but this, after being, seem-
ingly, on the verge of acceptance, was voted down on January 29.
With the cup of victory again dashed from his lips, Owen might
well have given up the fight, but he did not. Less than a week
before the final adjournment, he won by a personal appeal the
right to present his plan in a fourth and still weaker form.
Amid general astonishment, it passed, and for the second time
the civil equality of married women was written into the new
Hoosier constitution.17
There it did not long remain. That very afternoon, while
Owen was absent with the Committee on Revision, Milton
Gregg, veteran Whig editor and previously a staunch supporter
of the reform, moved a reconsideration of the morning's vote.
When the convention assembled the following day to act upon
the motion, rumors were current that Owen owed his last suc-
cess to chicanery. These stories he immediately and completely
refuted, but the tide had once more set against him. Whether
the delegates were influenced by sheer boredom or by the fact
that the measure, as Gregg later said, "had been frittered down
to a mere shadow, and, as it then stood, was of decidedly more
importance to the reputation of Mr. Owen, than of practical
utility to the women of Indiana" is not certain.18 But in an-
other surprising reversal of sentiment the previous day's action
was reconsidered, and by a vote of 68 to 63 the section con-
ferring independent rights of property upon married women
was again torn out of the new charter. That settlement was

Several factors help to explain the rejection of Owen's re-
form, though probably none was decisive in itself. There were
in the convention many conservative lawyers who looked with
horror at any inroads upon the English common law and many
timid individuals who were content to leave disputed matters
to the legislature. The fact that Owen's proposal had not been
demanded by the people strengthened the hands of these two
groups. Then, too, newspaper distortion linked the measure
in the minds of many with the radical Woman's Rights move-
ment in the East; and to the vast majority of Hoosiers the anti-
slavery, female suffrage, and "Bloomer" excesses of that
organization were anathema. The religious factor, of course,
was present, but its influence may be exaggerated. The Scrip-
tures furnished many of the arguments arrayed against the
proposed change, and clergymen both within and without the
convention were its bitterest opponents. But the former editor
of The Free Enquirer had plenty of quotations with which to
refute Biblical allusions; and when Reverend Mr. Badger tried
to show that the reform was the logical outgrowth of its spon-
sor's earlier infidel writings, the agnostic welcomed the oppor-
tunity to set forth his religious creed, as many liberals have
done before and since, in the words of Leigh Hunt's parable.

Much more disastrous to Owen's reform than the opposition
of the church was the hostility of the politicians. In an age of
extreme partisanship there were, of course, many Whigs who
voted against the measure merely because Owen introduced it,
while there were even more Democrats eager to kill it lest
success enhance the prestige of the sponsor in the forthcoming
Senatorial contest. The tactics of Owen's friends did much to
arouse jealousy among other members of the party. The ap-
pearance of the card announcing the Owen Testimonial was
exceedingly ill-timed and a blunder of the first magnitude. It
not only frightened other candidates for the Senate into re-
versing their votes but also alienated those delegates who were
aiding Owen in his struggle but to whom the singling out of
one man to receive the hero's laurels seemed unjust. On more
than one occasion in the subsequent debates the power of the
green-eyed monster was evident.

They vote them back again.
22
The refusal of the convention to write the legal equality of
married women into the new Indiana constitution was to Owen
a keen disappointment. He probably realized that his very
advocacy of the measure was something of a handicap, for
during the debates he deplored the attempts to arouse prejudice
against the reform by personal abuse of its sponsor. When it
was all over, however, he did his best to repress any bitter re-

23
While Owen was waging his losing battle on behalf of the
married women of Indiana, another Senatorial election took
place. As has been suggested, there was more than a temporal
relation between the two events. In 1850 Owen held some hope
that at last he would reach his goal. The free soil movement
had collapsed. The August landslide insured the selection of a
Democrat. Once again he was the choice of the "Pocket." 24
Finally he could expect the incumbent to be rotated out of
office, for it had been almost twenty years since an Indiana
Senator had succeeded himself.
Jesse D. Bright, however, was determined to retain the seat
to which he had been so unexpectedly elevated in 1845. A con-
summate politician, he had scaled the heights of national fame
rapidly and now left no stone unturned to secure reelection. He
spent the fall mending his fences throughout the state; it was
not until mid-December that he left belatedly to attend his
duties in Congress. Soon after his departure Owen discovered
what he thought to be a clear case of bribery among Bright's
followers and on January 6 reluctantly published his findings.
25
Bright's stock dropped at once, but not for long. The very next
day the Senator himself, having been warned before the story
broke, arrived dramatically from Washington. With the in-
cumbent upon the scene, his stock soared. For all the fuss over
the alleged bribery, nothing incriminating the Senator directly
had been revealed. Knowing ones continued to predict his
renomination just as they had before the incident.

On the evening of January io; 1851, the Democrats met in
caucus. On the very first ballot Bright received eight votes
more than was necessary for a choice. In this contest Owen
made the best showing of his career, yet he mustered only nine
supporters outside of his district.
27
Showing once again his
party regularity, he accepted the caucus verdict in good faith,
and on the next day Bright was reelected by a united Democ-
racy. Publicly the loser took his defeat philosophically, but in
private he betrayed intense disappointment. Writing to his
father more than a month later, when momentary passions
should have cooled, he attributed the result, unfairly, to Bright's
unscrupulous use of his great wealth.

Failure was not stamped on all of Owen's efforts at Indian-
apolis during the winter of 18501851. On the contrary, his
most absorbing task, the framing of the new constitution, was
eminently successful. Democrats and Whigs both lauded the
finished product, and its adoption by an overwhelming vote
seemed likely. The Committee on Revision came in for a fair
share of the praise, and Owen himself was singled out for
compliments. No delegate, it was said, had labored harder
than he. "Though he has a hobby," wrote one commentator,
he is a working man, and as an enlightened Legislator, he stands at
the head of the list of the great men of the Convention. I never
knew a man of brains (and that's Bob Owen), who could perform

hitherto most skeptical were forced to admit that, "however

ingeniously he compared the arguments used against his reform
with those raised against the Declaration of Independence in
1775-1776. To the great glee of his audience he quoted some
recent convention speeches and then translated them by sub-

for "generous husband," and "loving subject" for "devoted

for support to the religious sentiments of mankind. But the

of the recipient's writings on agnosticism and birth control.

Owen's admirers asserted, the reform had failed because of
personal prejudice against the sponsor, then the women of In-
diana owed very little to him.35

husbands and wives equal before the law. By the time of his
death they were already recognized as one of his strongest
claims to fame.36
Even then, however, the exact nature of his
services to the women of his adopted state was becoming blurred
in the public mind, and subsequent events only tended to create
further confusion. Early in the present century, when the
feminist cause was nearing its goal, a second and more per-
manent memorial was bestowed upon Owen in the form of a
bronze bust, at the south entrance of the Hoosier capitol.

of the credit for the reform's eventual triumph in 1853. As is
so often the case, however, other men who should be remem-

COMPLETING THE WORK
ON AUGUST 4, 1851, the people of Indiana gave an overwhelm-
ing approval to the work of the late convention. On that same
day Owen was elected as one of Posey's two delegates to the
lower house of the state legislature. In thus returning to the
scene of his first political efforts, Owen was governed as much
by a sense of duty as he was by personal desire or ambition.
Already he was probably making plans that were to bring the
Indiana years to a close. In the previous February he had
announced, for reasons not given, that he would not be a
candidate for Congress, and it was only in July that he was
prevailed upon to run for the legislature.

It was not an ordinary session of the Assembly in which
Owen consented to serve. To it fell the task of giving sub-
stance and meaning to the new constitutional provisions for
public schools, banking, and Negro exclusion. Upon it lay the
requirement of replacing the innumerable local and special
laws, now prohibited, by general legislation. In it would be
renewed the struggle over such disputed reforms as homestead
exemption, prohibition, and the civil equality of married
women. The length of the session was extraordinary in itself.
Instead of the usual two-or-three-month sitting, it lasted, except
for a six-week adjournment, from December until late June.
The caliber of its members was exceedingly high. John W.
Davis, former speaker in Congress, presided over the lower
house. Owen himself had refused to be a candidate for that
office in order that he might be on the important committees.

and Privileges of Citizens; he sat on those specially raised to
report on "free banking" and homestead exemption; and in
March he was elected head of the group from both houses to
which was entrusted the revision of the statute law.

Many of the contested matters left unsettled by the conven-
tion were promptly liquidated. A "free banking" system, based
upon a report written by Owen, was enacted. The Maine liquor
law, then attracting much attention, was rejected, and the mod-
erate policy urged by Owen was followed. Homestead exemption
still failed to find favor, but Owen's compromise measure ex-
empting $300 worth of real and personal property from seizure
proved successful. In view of the decisive popular mandate
in August, Negro exclusion was easily effected. More diffi-
culty was experienced with a colonization fund, regarded by
Owen and others as a necessary complement to exclusion;
but by dint of great efforts, public and private, a bill appro-
priating $5,000, half the figure desired by Owen, was
passed.

The legislation most anticipated by the people was the new
school law. Although the principle for which enlightened men
were then striving, compulsory taxation for the support of free
primary instruction, is universally accepted today, in 1851 few
states had traveled that far. Indiana had never imposed a levy
upon all her citizens for such a purpose; but a growing agita-
tion in the forties, led by Caleb Mills and Henry F. West, and
climaxed by the peremptory wording of the new constitution,
placed the issue squarely before the General Assembly. Despite
his earlier interest in the subject, Owen did not participate in
the Hoosier educational campaign of the last decade, nor were
his efforts in the convention along that line especially notable.

In the legislature that met in December 1851 Owen made
two contributions to the cause of education. The first and less
popular was his dogged defense of Indiana University. Just as
in the previous year, the institution at Bloomington was being
threatened by those who wished to use its endowment for the
common schools. Parsimonious lawmakers who once neglected
the elementary grades for grandiose schemes of internal im-
provements now proposed to make belated amends by destroy-
ing the single non-sectarian college in the state. Owen boldly
opposed this demagogic move. The only concession that he
would make was one he had offered in the Constitutional Con-
vention, to wit, the creation of a normal school as an integral
part of the establishment at Bloomington.
5
Such a compromise,
however, failed to win acceptance; and on February 2, 1852,
Owen's valiant maneuvers notwithstanding, the lower house
went on record as favoring the diversion of the entire income
and property of Indiana University to the common school sys-
tem of the state.

Fortunately for the cause of higher learning
that vote was merely an expression of opinion. Fortunately,
too, Owen as chairman of the Committee on Education, was in
a position to block any bill seeking to make that opinion effec-
tive. This he did, and it was not until mid-June, when he was
absent attending the Democratic National Convention, that
the enemies of the university were able to report a measure
depriving it of its funds. By then the strength of the movement
had been sapped, and the proposal was rejected.

COMPLETING THE WORK 287
Owen's second contribution to Hoosier education during the
winter of 1851-1852 came in connection with the new school
law. He was not, as is sometimes asserted, its author; for its
general outline was the product of many minds and its specific
details the work of James R. M. Bryant, a Whig Representa-
tive from Warren county.
8
As with the Smithsonian Bill, how-
ever, Owen was eminently useful both as a persuasive speaker
in its behalf and as a legislative steersman who secured a full
and fair hearing and a prompt settlement. Early in the session
Owen committed himself to a scheme of compulsory taxation;
and after his committee's bill was reported, he took special
pains to defend that feature. Without such a general levy, he
showed, the schools could be kept open only a month and a
half each year, certainly not the period the constitution con-
templated. A tax of five cents on each $100 worth of property
netted the expenses of an additional month. In an eloquent
appeal against the easy and popular course of light taxation,
Owen dramatically held aloft a shining five-cent piece, the sum,
he said, daily expended by each Hoosier on liquor and tobacco.
To collect five times that amount from every taxpayer for the
purpose of instructing the young was the goal at which the
Western Democrat was aiming.
9
In the middle of May Owen reported back from the Com-
mittee on Revision the new school bill. During the next ten
days it was again debated and amended, but finally on May 20
it passed by a vote of 57 to 31. Despite important modifications
of Owen's wishes, the law formed a landmark in the history of
Hoosier education. For the first time the whole state was to be
taxed for the benefit of its children and at a rate equal to the
optional levy of 1849. For thirty-five years the requirements
of the old constitution had gone unfulfilled; within a single
year those of the new were met. For this result Robert Dale
Owen was in no small way responsible. Under his leadership
the entire elementary system was centralized, a single Com-

and, most important of all, an ad valorem impost of ten cents
on every $100 worth of property decreed. One valuable sec-
tion for which Owen especially strove required the formation
of a free library in every township. No provision was more
bitterly fought than this, but by a humorous analogy Owen
saved the day, and the township libraries remained to be-
come one of the most useful features of the epochal law of

Less spectacular and less well known than his contribution
to the public school system was Owen's equally important part
in revising the Indiana statute law. Legal reform had been a
prominent demand among the people in 1849 and ^So, and
the new constitution not only required a simplification of pro-
cedure in the courts of justice but also looked toward the
reduction of all earlier legislation into a systematic code. Once
before, during 1837-1838, Owen had served on a Committee
of Revision; and now on March 8, after an unpleasant but in-
significant controversy, he was named chairman of a group
comprising members of both houses which was to sit during
the six-week mid-session adjournment of the Assembly.
11
This
appointment was deemed important enough to precipitate a
blast from the Whig press which regretted that Owen was now
in a position to "fix up 'woman's rights' or any other of his
cherished reforms." One correspondent called him "a theorist,
a speculatist, a visionary . . .
[who] in all probability would
load the laws with his extreme radical notions. . . ."
12
But the man whose hand was most prominent in the revision
of 1852 was not a radical theorist. With the relish for propa-
gandism long since dead, Owen had become a practical, indus-
trious legislator, occasionally mistaken in his tactics, but never

appointment was deemed important enough to precipitate a
blast from the Whig press which regretted that Owen was now
in a position to Hfix up 'woman's rights' or any other of his
cherished reforms." One correspondent called him "a theorist,
a speculatist, a visionary . . . [who] in all probability would
load the laws with his extreme radical notions. . . ." 12
But the man whose hand was most prominent in the revision
of 1852 was not a radical theorist. With the relish for propa-
gandism long since dead, Owen had become a practical, indus-
trious legislator, occasionally mistaken in his tactics, but never

and that was a desire to extirpate excessive verbiage and mean-
ingless forms from the law. His advanced ideas on the treat-
ment of debts, his statute of descent in 1838, and his struggle
for the civil equality of married women had given evidence of
this. A very practical bill that he championed at this time

The conviction
that the law should be comprehensible to the common man was,
then, the spirit in which Owen directed the revision. Over five
hundred pages of the old code were eliminated. The distinction
between law and equity was abolished. Recent acts legalizing
the short form of deeds, prohibiting distress for rent, and ex-
empting $300 worth of real and personal property from seizure
were approved. The resulting code embodied Owen's concep-

The one item in the revised statutes in which Owen took the

dying without a will were an old story to him. He had long
known that, whether in such a case a wife had children or not,
she was entitled to but one third of the property, real and
personal, and that even the former, the so-called widow's
dower, was held in tenancy, not outright ownership. He had
long known that few estates in the West exceeded $3,000, the
annual income from a third of which was obviously insufficient
to maintain the widow. He knew, too, that the problem was a

A notable triumph early in his legislative career had been the
law of 1838 which gave the surviving wife two thirds of the

had been omitted in the revision of 1843. In the Constitutional
Convention Owen had injudiciously subordinated a juster treat-

women, with the result that he failed to achieve either reform.
Thus, when he returned to Indianapolis in 1851 to complete the

the Whigs made an issue of the time and money spent by the
Democrats in the convention and in the legislature on both
necessary and unnecessary changes. As a leader in those bodies
and a champion of many novel measures, Owen was subjected

But these contemporary encomiums must not lead us,

the legislative father of the Indiana common-school system,"

did not "put Indiana ahead of all other states in enlightened
laws for women," nor was it "years before other states came
abreast." Writers at the time admitted that with respect to
the property rights of married women, the Hoosiers still lagged

the ultraism of the New York period. When in October 1851

Compared to Henry C. Wright who addressed that Dublin
gathering, Owen, to be sure, was no radical. He was, rather,
still a Western Democrat, but one with some very liberal ideas.

Lane himself was received at Indianapolis as a conquering hero.
Three months later the Democratic State Convention chose his
followers to attend the national gathering at Baltimore. Once
again Owen proved useful in drawing up the resolutions for
his friend's candidacy, furnishing a platform which he be-
lieved to be "at once just, safe & popular."

One more step remained to complete the Lane boom. That
was to make "Andrew Jackson of Indiana" better known out-
side of the state. The Hoosier Democrats had long been aware
that their man lacked the national reputation of Cass, Bu-
chanan, and Douglas and that, except for their state, he was
the first choice of no other commonwealth. As early as the fall
of 1849 Nathaniel Bolton, husband of the poetess and then
correspondent of the New Albany Ledger, asked Owen to write
a short biography of Lane, sufficient to keep his war fame from
being forgotten. Owen agreed, and in December Bolton men-
tioned the fact in his column without directly naming Owen.
The political meeting that Owen attended a month later for-
mally resolved that he should prepare a campaign sketch, and
those present understood him to have consented.

of Joseph Lane "Not Inappropriately Styled by His Brother
Officers and Soldiers, the Marion of the War" It was designed
to give, without offence to any other candidate, an account of
the man who was the first choice of the Hoosiers, in the hope
that if the convention was unable to decide upon another, it
might unite behind this new Cincinnatus fresh from the people.
Lane's early life was compressed into two pages, and even the
glorious exploits of his Mexican campaigns were subordinated
to the constructive achievements of Oregon's first territorial
governor. Both from its clear, terse style and its wealth of
anecdote this slight volume ranks among the most readable of
campaign biographies. Although the name of the author, who
called himself "Western," was carefully concealed at the time
and although it has not been discovered by the leading libraries
of the country today, there can be little doubt that it was
Robert Dale Owen. It is something of a coincidence that his
facile pen should be turned to the service of an old friend in
the same year that Nathaniel Hawthorne was making his con-
tribution to the election of Franklin Pierce. Both men were to
have their reward.31
As a final favor to Lane, Owen attended the Baltimore Con-
vention, thereby violating the maxim laid down by himself ten
years before that no legislator should forsake public business
for partisan activity. He might have spared himself the trouble,
for his role was neither conspicuous nor decisive. He was
placed on the Committee of Resolutions, but there is no evi-
dence that he was in any way responsible for the conservative
platform that emanated from that body. He made no speech
from the floor, and the real voice of the Indiana delegation was
not Owen's but that of Jesse D. Bright.

Lane, but the Hoosier favorite never obtained more than one

result of the shift was the total collapse of the Lane boom and

abandoned. Now, however, he seemed convinced that his fam-

he wanted it to have; and he contemplated taking his wife, his
sister, and their children to Germany and then returning alone
to Indiana in search of remunerative employment, preferably
public office.

Upon his return to New Harmony late in June 1852 a new
factor entered Owen's plans. There he found a letter from
Joe Lane containing an unprompted offer to unite, in event of
Pierce's election, with the Indiana members of Congress in
recommending Owen for any diplomatic post he might wish.
If he had not considered such a mission before in connection
with his family plans, Owen must have then realized that a
minor sinecure at Rome or Naples would enable him not only
to escort his wife and children across the Atlantic but also to
remain near them while holding public office. The same letter,
however, mentioned the possible resignation of Senator Whit-
comb whose term had a couple of years still to run. Of the two
openings Owen first leaned to the seat in the upper house. He
felt that, if an interim appointment had to be made, his own
chances were good and that, once in office, he would be con-
firmed by the next Democratic legislature. Optimistic as ever,
he wrote at once to his Indianapolis friends to discover Gov-
ernor Wright's intentions and to Lane to stress the importance
of having Whitcomb resign before Congress adjourned.
36
As the summer of 1852 wore on, a diplomatic position, espe-
cially that at Naples, became more attractive. Owen, of course,
could not afford, even if he could obtain, a mission to a major
power; and he did not wish, as he said, to bury himself in
South America. Early in July he was quizzing Trist on the
duties of a charge d'affaires and writing to a former incumbent
at the Neapolitan court for further details. Yet it must be
admitted that this growing preference for a foreign post re-
sulted from the increasing difficulty of attaining the Senator-
ship. Whitcomb gave no more indications of resigning; and
even when he died suddenly in the autumn, Wright announced
that the selection of a successor would be left to the Assembly.

From that body Owen could expect nothing. He had taken no
part in the campaign of 1852, and already his reforms of the
previous year were being criticized, especially in the south
where his strength had always been the greatest. Thus even
as early as November Owen was willing, more from necessity
than from choice, to withdraw from the Senatorial contest,
provided the president gave some sign of encouragement. If no
word of hope, however, was received by December, he told
Lane, he would be compelled to let his name go before the
caucus. While in Indianapolis in January Owen finally received
two letters from Lane which, although not affording assurance
of the Neapolitan appointment, were sufficient to make him
stand aloof for the first time since 1838 from an election to the
United States Senate.
38
As the final decision on his future was delayed during the
autumn, winter, and spring, Owen's patience was sorely tried.
For the most part he had to leave the matter to Lane, but what
little he could do for himself, he did. As soon as he learned
that Pierce would be guided by the advice of governors in
Democratic states, Owen obtained a strong letter from Wright
in which the latter shut himself off from supporting any other
applicant. He secured, too, recommendations from high state
officers, justices of the Indiana supreme court, and members
of the faculty at Bloomington. Professor Larrabee, an alumnus
of Pierce's college, wrote on his own initiative,
Among all the men whom I have ever known, I have found no one

ars and philanthropists than Robert Dale Owen. . . . Were I at

At Washington, Owen sought the aid of such old friends as
Buchanan, Rush, Dallas, and Hunter, while at home he tried
to enlist the press in his cause. For some time papers in and
out of the state had mentioned him as a cabinet possibility,
but after his visit to Madison in February, the Democratic
journal in that city changed its tone and stated that a charge-
ship would be most fitting for him.39
Upon the advice of friends Owen left for Washington early
in February. A convenient opportunity was afforded by his
selection as chairman of a committee to obtain plans for a new
Odd Fellows' Hall at Indianapolis. In the East Owen dis-
charged that duty and performed a final service for Indiana
University, but his main concern was the diplomatic post. By
March he was confident of success, but it was not until two
months later that the long suspense ended. Then, out of sixty-
six applicants Owen was chosen as charge d'affaires to the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the sinecure he had desired above
all others.
40
The appointment was well received by the press.
Even Greeley, who six years before had spoken uncomplimen-
tary things about Embree's victim, now said of the selection,
"We are heartily glad of it. He [Owen] is not so good nor so
thoroughly honest as his father . . . but he is amiable, intelli-
gent, kindhearted, and unlike the general run of party hacks,
has ideas in his head."

To Joe Lane, Owen could pay no
higher tribute than one he had rendered before victory had
been achieved. "It will always be," he had written, "a true
pleasure to me to remember, that, in the heartless world of
politics, I met so true a friend as you." More than a score

of years later Owen still recalled with gratitude that token of
friendship.
42
No man appears to advantage while soliciting an appointive
office, yet some light may be thrown on his character by his
words and deeds at such a time. Thus Owen was too con-
scientious not to tell Lane after listing his capacities for the
post,
I am exceedingly anxious not to appear . . . one of that countless
army of office-seekers, who besiege the doors of every newly elected
President. . . . But somebody must fill these offices. And all that
is really reprehensible is to apply, without the requisite qualifications.
Perseverance was also one of Owen's strong points, and his ac-
tions during 1852-1853 reveal his tenacity. Optimism and out-
ward equanimity were likewise characteristic. When Lane
feared that, despite the Hoosier's withdrawal from the Sena-
torial contest, Bright and his henchmen might yet block Owen's
recommendation, the latter replied, "Don't trouble yourself,
for a moment, even if the chance for Naples should fail. We
have acted for the best. And it is only children who sit down
& complain, if after all proper exertion, the cards turn up
against them." 43
After a five-month absence Owen returned to New Harmony
on June 8 in triumph. Two weeks later several carriages and
wagons containing Mary and himself; their four children, rang-
ing from Florence aged seventeen to the second Ernest aged

of years later Owen still recalled with gratitude that token of
friendship.42
No man appears to advantage while soliciting an appointive
office, yet some light may be thrown on his character by his
words and deeds at such a time. Thus Owen was too con-
scientious not to tell Lane after listing his capacities for the
post,
I am exceedingly anxious not to appear . . . one of that countless
army of office-seekers, who besiege the doors of every newly elected
President. . . . But somebody must fill these offices. And all that
is really reprehensible is to apply, without the requisite qualifications.
Perseverance was also one of Owen's strong points, and his ac-
tions during 1852-1853 reveal his tenacity. Optimism and out-
ward equanimity were likewise characteristic. When Lane
feared that, despite the Hoosier's withdrawal from the Sena-
torial contest, Bright and his henchmen might yet block Owen's
recommendation, the latter replied, "Don't trouble yourself,
for a moment, even if the chance for Naples should fail. We
have acted for the best. And it is only children who sit down
& complain, if after all proper exertion, the cards turn up
against them." 43
After a five-month absence Owen returned to New Harmony
on June 8 in triumph. Two weeks later several carriages and
wagons containing Mary and himself; their four children, rang-
ing from Florence aged seventeen to the second Ernest aged
three; Jane and her family; Dale's son Alfred; and numerous
trunks and cases that foretold a long journey rolled over the
new plank road to Mt. Vernon. Low water on the Ohio de-

As Owen watched the dim American coastline fade away in
the hot August evening, his thoughts must have returned to
that bright May day twenty-one years before when he and
Mary, literally and figuratively, embarked upon their voyage
through life together. Just as it was not apparent then, so was
it not clear to him now that this departure, like the last, was
bringing to a close a definite period of his life. For more than
ten years prior to his marriage he had lived, both in England
and in America, in an atmosphere of reform where the ideal had
been to aid humanity by attacking without reserve every evil in
the world and every foible of mankind. After 1833 a new en-
vironment, together with maturing years and family responsi-
bilities, changed that ideal. During the next two decades Owen
had sought political advancement, not for the spoils of office
but as a legitimate and customary way of developing his own
powers, winning the esteem of his neighbors, and influencing
the lives of his fellow men. Some of his older friends suspected
in these years that he was sacrificing his humanitarian prin-
ciples for the loaves and fishes of party politics; but, on the
whole, he managed to resist that temptation. In the years 1850
to 1852, in the proper sphere of state legislation, Owen achieved
in a conservative way many of his cherished reforms that he
had first broached as editor of a freethought paper more than
twenty years before.
While standing on the ship's deck, Owen perhaps thought,
too, of those old friends. Maclure and his corps of scientists
were dead. Except for his octogenarian father and the oldest
inhabitants of New Harmony, Owen had lost touch with all
the participants in the abortive experiment on the banks of the
Wabash. Only the friendship with Trist remained from the
New York years. Death had claimed Frances Wright, Knee-
land, and Baxter. Brownson was already an important figure
in Catholic circles. Evans had lapsed into silence, and Gilbert
was alienated by Owen's course on slavery.
During the remaining years of his life Owen was to live in
still another environment and among friends who differed from

in its organic and statute law. He left it when the party that
had espoused them stood practically unopposed. It was more

FAR from the American West, with its physical crudities, party

of an eventful life. In his opinion Naples embodied all that
was outwardly splendid and beautiful in this world. More than
a score of years after he had first gazed upon it, he thus de-
scribed the scene that never faded from his mind:
London is unmatched in its way; Paris is a dazzling wonder; Switzer-
land is a marvel of majestic beauty; but save the rose-hued fairy-

From his windows he commanded a magnificent view of the
glorious bay with the enchanting islands that dotted its lan-
guid waters. At his door lay the city's most fashionable parks

Strada Nuova along the rock-bound, vine-clad shore brought
him to Baiae, beloved of the Augustan Age. Near by were
Pompeii and Herculaneum, mute symbols of a rich and ancient
civilization, while over all loomed Vesuvius the destroyer.

Naples as a place of foreign residence. It is not so easy to

his name stink in the nostrils of liberals everywhere and in no

after calls at
Genoa, Leghorn, and the Civita Vecchia, brought him at last

At the outset, Owen's mission to this discredited kingdom
seemed to offer little difficulty. As the new charge read through
the archives of the legation, established in 1831, he learned
that important diplomatic problems seldom arose, that only
two treaties had been negotiated in the past, and that the
chief business consisted of the prevention of commercial and
maritime discriminations and the settlement of petty claims.
Fortunately Morris had liquidated all of the latter, and his
own instructions were limited to securing a removal of some
vexatious quarantine regulations in Neapolitan ports. Thus the
new representative could be cordially received by Luigi Carafa,
the Sicilian Minister of Foreign Affairs; and on October 28
he journeyed northward to Caserta for a pleasant audience
with the notorious Ferdinand. Owen soon discovered, however,
that all was not to be clear sailing, for minor officials were con-
stantly and deliberately violating the trade treaty of 1846.
With "Bomba" and his government heartily detested at home,
the Indianan had to take a strong stand on these trivial annoy-
ances, yet the men with whom he had to deal were so dilatory,
so evasive, and so mendacious that for more than a year his
tenure was filled with complaints and quarrels that seriously
jeopardized amicable relations with the country to which he
was accredited.

aboard belligerent vessels is not confiscable, A pact just signed
by Russia and the United States was to serve as a model. Owen
received these instructions in mid-October and by the 25th
had won Sicilian consent to the project. After waiting for his
powers as negotiator, he went to work again; and within another
twelve days the treaty was on its way to Washington for ap-
proval by the Senate before adjournment.

Owen was not
wholly satisfied with the completed protocol since Carafa had
not given him a free hand, but he did think that it contained
everything desired by the secretary of state. By his prompt
action, moreover, he became the first of Marcy's envoys to
execute the instructions of September 8, i854.

The more important treaty drafted by Owen dealt with amity,
trade, and navigation. In December 1854 the Indianan in-
formed the State Department that certain privileges, recently
granted by Naples to the Papal States, could be obtained for
American commerce under a reciprocal agreement. Marcy's
reply went beyond this suggestion and empowered his minister
to draw up an entirely new pact to replace that of 1846, which
would soon expire. In the ensuing negotiations the main point
in dispute was the right of alien Protestants to private worship
and sepulcher. At his chief's urgent request Owen had, without
much hope, included such a provision in his draft, but it had
been eliminated at once by the Sicilians. They bluntly stated
they had no authority to grant the right and that they were
prepared to abandon the treaty altogether if the United States
made it a sine qua nan. Having disposed of other matters in

American commerce under a reciprocal agreement. Marcy's
reply went beyond this suggestion and empowered his minister
to draw up an entirely new pact to replace that of 1846, which
would soon expire. In the ensuing negotiations the main point
in dispute was the right of alien Protestants to private worship
and sepulcher. At his chief's urgent request Owen had, without
much hope, included such a provision in his draft, but it had
been eliminated at once by the Sicilians. They bluntly stated
they had no authority to grant the right and that they were
prepared to abandon the treaty altogether if the United States
made it a sine qua non. Having disposed of other matters in

sidered the finished product as not only more liberal than its
predecessor but also as containing the most sweeping conces-
sions which a foreign country had yet obtained from the King-
dom of the Two Sicilies. He was especially pleased with the
abolition of differential duties, with the greater protection
given rights of person and property, and with the equality that
Americans enjoyed with the Neapolitans in indirect trade. The
failure to obtain religious freedom was, he felt, less serious in

Although acceptable to the State Department, Owen's treaty

Owen had deferred to Carafa, might be abused with regard to

reconsideration it passed with but slight amendments. These

as tension grew between "Bomba" and the Western powers,
the stock of the American representative rose. Concessions
began to be granted almost unasked; and the king openly sig-

minister resident, be raised again to that of minister pleni-

In September 1858 Owen's five-year residence at Naples came
to an end. His term had been unmarked by any incident sig-
nificant in American diplomatic history, and it closed before
Garibaldi's epochal march. Yet if Owen's work was unimpor-
tant, it was none the less well done. The first duty of a minis-
ter is to maintain friendly relations with the nation to which
he is accredited. That Owen did despite American prejudices
against Neapolitan despotism. He succeeded where a Soule
would have failed because he showed respect even for that
which he disliked and because, unlike his British colleague, he
refused to intrigue with Italian exiles and revolutionists. From
September 1855, when Ferdinand suggested that his rank be
raised, until the final audience three years later, Owen re-

Owen discharged equally well the second fundamental duty
of a diplomat, scrupulous care of his country's interests. While
striving to please the despot with whom he had to deal, he never
forgot that he was an American. With the State Department,
moreover, he remained on the best of terms. None of his actions
were disapproved; some were specially commended. His sug-
gestions on Neapolitan affairs were usually followed. To be
sure, the Indianan was not particularly fitted either by previous
experience or by training in international law for the post he
held, but such defects were not exceptional in the charges of
the day. His linguistic accomplishments, on the other hand,
were extremely good. Finally, Owen was not a troublesome
envoy. Although he had to threaten at times to gain his ends
and on four occasions summoned warships to Naples, he never
went so far as to break off relations. "I exceedingly dislike,"
he had written during the exasperating Carbone case, "the

During his first year at Naples Owen's title was changed to
minister resident. This promotion was not a reward for any
meritorious deed but rather part of a general reorganization of
the diplomatic service. The new grade, however, did not carry
with it a larger stipend, and the Indianan quickly discovered
that $4,500 was insufficient to make.ends meet. In March 1855
Congress sought to replace all ministers resident by ministers
plenipotentiary with a corresponding increase in salary; but
Pierce, to the great chagrin of Owen, who had already pur-
chased a carriage and horses in anticipation, refused to sanction
the step. Owen's private correspondence that fall clearly re-
veals his displeasure at the executive's course. In August 1856
the confusion was finally straightened out by a supplemental
law, effective from the previous July, authorizing a remunera-
tion of $7,500. Consequently the Hoosier soon ceased to draw
on his personal income.

With the presidential election of 1856 came the question of
continuance in office. More than a month before that event
Owen wrote directly to Buchanan to learn the policy of what
he expected to be the next administration. The incumbent did
not suppose that he would be allowed another full term abroad;
but he would like, he said, to remain at least one year longer
both because of the probable advancement in his rank and
because his older son had not yet completed his studies in
Germany. The Pennsylvanian's reply was brief and to the point.

that the Western Democrat had found life enjoyable at the court
of absolutism. In his later autobiographical writings he did
not depict Naples as a den of iniquity or corruption; even the
notorious "Bomba" was portrayed as the victim of an out-
moded system.

It is not altogether surprising that, after a
stormy career in politics, the intellectually inclined Owen should
relish the calm of his romantic retreat. There were no re-

answer. Except in winter the work was not arduous, and the
society in which he moved was more cultured than that of his
Hoosier home. A steady income was assured, one which by 1856
had become ample for his needs. Finally, the position con-

which Owen always set much store.

three persons in his own building were stricken. Less dis-

Historically, Owen's five years in Naples were insignificant,

they isolated him from the heresies and factionalism then con-
vulsing the Democracy. During his subsequent public career
Owen sought to stand aloof from and above parties. Culturally,

Carafa and on the twentieth had a final audience with King

his feelings were obviously mixed. He was leaving behind a

by the Neapolitans and saw in their extreme courtesy, imper-
turbable good nature, and universal charity virtues that com-
pensated for "a multitude of sins." But he had learned all
that Naples had to teach. It had been "an interesting page in

SPIRITUALISM
WHEN Owen left Naples in the autumn of 1858, he believed
that his public career was at an end. There was no office save
that of United States Senator to which he aspired, and his pro-
longed absence from Indiana hardly improved his chances for
that. Even before his departure, moreover, he had found a new
interest, "something more serious & important than any party
struggle." Logically and fearlessly pursued, it would block
for the moment, perhaps for all time, his election to any gov-
ernmental position. Owen was not blind to the consequences.
Late in 1856 he told Buchanan, "I hope ever to take an active
interest in the politics of our country; but, for the rest of my
life, in a private station only."

The fact is, Owen had become absorbed in the study of
spiritualism. It was on the 25th of March, 1856, that he had
called informally in the evening at the home of Kakoschkine,
the Russian plenipotentiary. There the conversation turned to
automatic spirit writing, and in a moment of levity the gather-
ing decided to make a test of the mysterious force. Each person
present was seated before a table and given a lead pencil to rest
upon a blank piece of paper. After a time the hand of an
American lady, one of Owen's friends, began to make lines but
no words. Not satisfied, Madame Frescobaldi, the wife of the
Tuscan minister, asked aloud who had given her the gold pins
she was then wearing in her dress. Once again the same per-
son's pencil moved, this time completing the illegible and
apparently irrelevant sentence, "the one that gives you a maid
and cook." While the amused company roared with laughter,
the questioner turned pale and excitedly explained that the pins

last fortnight had recommended to her both a new cook and a

Why Owen should have sought an ultramundane explanation
for this coincidence is a question for a psychologist rather than
a biographer. The latter must be content merely to point out
what had gone before. Unlike many converts to spiritualism,
Owen had experienced no recent bereavement among family
or among friends. In 1842 he had shown a momentary interest
in Joseph Rhodes Buchanan's experiments in mesmerism, but
these certainly did not shake his conviction that this world is
the be all and the end all. A decade later in the Indiana legis-
lature he had said while eulogizing a deceased colleague,
Well has it been said: whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, no knowledge nor
wisdom in the grave. . . . The little good a man may do in this
world, he must do quickly. The years pass, even while we are taking
thought how they should be spent. . . . Let us be up and doing
while it is yet day; the night cometh, when no man shall work.
At that time the Western Democrat took no notice of American
spiritualism either when he traveled near its birthplace in New
York while investigating plank roads or when the first rappings
invaded Indianapolis and the "Pocket." In 1853, on hearing
of Robert Owen's conversion, he regretted "as every judicious
friend must, the strange infatuation which has overtaken my
good father."

made a silent vow to probe the matter to its depths, to see
whether the phenomenon was evidence of a future existence or
simply a delusion. Out of the slight incident of three gold pins
grew a study which, Owen later confessed, "eventually changed

The subject which Owen proposed to investigate was a vast
one, for since the beginning of time man has tried to solve the
riddle of the next world. Interest in the supernatural and the
preternatural has not been alien to America; and in the nine-
teenth century the foundations of the movement with which we
are concerned was laid by the Swedenborgians, the Shakers,
the mesmerists of the forties, and finally by the clairvoyant
deeds of Andrew Jackson Davis. To Kate Fox, nine-year-old
daughter of an obscure farmer in western New York, however,
goes the credit for recognizing on March 31, 1848, the first
manifestations of "modern spiritualism." From the tiny hamlet
of Hydesville in Wayne county spread the word that certain
noises or rappings exhibited intelligence when spoken to and
that, by means of a simple alphabet, conversation could be had
with the shades of the departed. The consequences were in-
calculable. Ultramundane communications which formerly had
been sought only by trained scientists, a special priestcraft,
or by secluded mystics became in democratic America the
solace and the plaything of the common man. Untutored per-
sons of both sexes, whose thoughts had seldom before strayed
from the workaday world, attained fame overnight as mediums
through which deceased scholars and statesmen spoke. Thanks
to favorable conditions and, perhaps, competitive pressure, the

until it became, at last, a new religion and a new reform. But in
the early fifties it was, as yet, neither but rather, to use Owen's
definition, an "American epidemic."

Owen's conversion to spiritualism was a very gradual one.
After three months of frequent seances and extensive reading
he was still puzzled and inclined to attribute the phenomena to
animal magnetism. After more than one hundred sittings he
had yet to find any conclusive evidence and thought it might be
some time before he could speak with certainty. In January
1857 he remained unconvinced but was ready to spend his next

When he left Naples, Owen apparently had not fully accepted
the theory of ultramundane intervention. At the end of the
manuscript volume of "Personal Observations," which he was
then keeping, he listed his conclusions up to that date. He
believed that there was a phase of life after death in which
individual identity and character were retained. He believed
that under certain conditions, one of which was the presence
of a medium, the dead could communicate with the living. Their
spirits might, on occasion, move considerable weights, produce
sounds, and read minds. All these manifestations took place in
accordance with natural laws. To substantiate such an hypothe-
sis Owen admitted that he had, as yet, insufficient data. Yet
he knew of no non-spiritual explanation that accounted so well
for certain undeniable facts. "It remains to be seen," he con-
cluded, "whether further experiments will confirm or disprove

until it became, at last, a new religion and a new reform. But in
the early fifties it was, as yet, neither but rather, to use Owen's
definition, an "American epidemic." 5
Owen's conversion to spiritualism was a very gradual one.
After three months of frequent seances and extensive reading
he was still puzzled and inclined to attribute the phenomena to
animal magnetism. After more than one hundred sittings he
had yet to find any conclusive evidence and thought it might be
some time before he could speak with certainty. In January
I 8s7 he remained unconvinced but was ready to spend his next
years in an attempt to solve the problem. "If," he told his
father, "it be a delusion, it is a very dangerous one, & ought to
be thoroughly exposed. But if it be a reality, then I deem it
a more powerful lever for the gradual amelioration of mankind
than any other with which I am acquainted." 6

Upon leaving Naples Owen went alone directly to Paris.
There he visited with his son Julian (Mary and the other two
children having sailed for home in July) ,
but the main purpose
was to consult Baron de Guldenstubbe, author of a recent
treatise on spirit writing. While engrossed in studies of the
ultramundane, Owen received word that his father was dying.
At once he crossed the Channel and reached the Park Farm
at Sevenoaks, Kent, on October 7. He found his aged sire out
of danger but suffering painfully from an enlarged prostate
gland. The reunion was cordial but brief. Seeing no cause
for immediate worry if due caution were observed, the son
proceeded to London and then on to Edinburgh where, as newly
appointed trustee of the David Dale estate, his presence was
required. It was probably on this occasion that he returned to
Glasgow after an absence of three decades to be shocked by
the industrialization of the section about Charlotte Street; and
it may have been then that he saw for the first time in as many
years Margaret, the sweetheart of his youth. She, too, was
happily married; and after exchanging fond recollections, the
old lovers parted, never to meet or hear of each other again.

Meanwhile, the ailing Robert Owen, having collapsed while
making an unnecessary speech at Liverpool, had gone to New-

door but unwilling to recognize the fact. All that day the gar-
rulous octogenarian talked of his plans for the future, but
when night fell, he sank steadily. As the first pale glimmer of
light crept into the room the next morning, a feeble voice mur-
mured, "Very easy and comfortable." Then, without the con-
traction of a muscle or the least expression of pain, as gently

versal happiness, and universal peace. Neither would have ac-

theory of Western decay. Each led a life of incessant activity;
and each, after many disappointments, wrote in his last years
an autobiography breathing a fervent faith in the bright destiny
of the human race. Both received an undue share of publicity
during their careers. Each was a religionist in youth, an agnos-

On November 21, 1858, Robert Owen was laid to rest beside
his parents in the Newtown churchyard. His freethinking dis-
ciples were highly disgusted by the religious services accom-
panying the burial, but a more tolerant son acquiesced in order
to avoid a needless scene and an offence to the Christian vil-
lagers. After the ceremony Owen returned to London to settle,
among other things, his father's estate. Except for the annual
income derived from the trust created by his sons in 1844 out
of lands in New Harmony, the aged philanthropist had died
penniless; and his debts and funeral expenses amounted to
$2,500. Thus it was extraordinarily convenient that the Ameri-

tactful letter a loan of $6,000 made by his father to the Duke
of Kent a quarter of a century before.

to publish before the end of 1859. Originally entitled "Re-

as belief grew, came to be called "Probabilities of Ultramun-

East winding up business with the Department of State and
procuring more data for his forthcoming volume. In New
York he was introduced to John Worth Edmonds, eminent
jurist and perhaps the most distinguished advocate of spiritual-
ism in America. Edmonds had read some of Owen's chapters
in manuscript while the latter was still in England and had
written the Banner of Light that it would be the best book on
the subject yet to appear. Another prominent convert, met at
this time, was James J. Mapes, able New Jersey agriculturist
and father of Mary Mapes Dodge. At Roslyn he visited Bryant
and it was on the poet's advice that he contracted with J. B.
Lippincott for the publication of his work. The Indianan had
preferred at first a New York firm but changed his mind when
he learned from Susan Warner, author of The Wide, Wide
World, that the Philadelphian did twice the business of Har-
per's or Appleton's. Highly elated by the favorable terms ob-
tained and by Lippincott's roseate predictions of a 50,000
volume circulation, he finally reached New Harmony at the end

sidered the essence of the work, he refused to dismiss all dreams
as meaningless or testimony of hauntings that would be accepted
in a court of law. There he boldly sketched the next phase of
existence. The spirit, he wrote,
must retain, for a longer or shorter period, not only its general habits
of thought and motives of action, but even its petty peculiarities and
favorite predilections. There must be no sudden change ... at the
moment of death. . . . Men will awake in another life, the body left
behind, and, with it, its corporeal instincts, its physical infirmities;
yet each will awake the same individual, morally, socially, intellectu-
ally. . . .
Such a phantom might by sound, touch, or sight make itself
perceptible to the living. But that was not its purpose. In this
second stage of life there were tasks to be performed, obliga-
tions to be fulfilled, pleasures to be enjoyed. The spirit had
still to prepare itself for the Day of Judgment. Realizing that
he had traveled far from the beaten path, the author said
curtly, with a flash of The Free Enquirer style, "All this may
sound heterodox. The more important inquiry is, whether it is
irrational."
M
Although primarily concerned with the reality, not the ad-
vantages of ultramundane intervention, Owen did not shirk the
question so often hurled at spiritualists, "Cui bono?" The
manifestations, he thought, gave assurance of immortality to
those unable to believe in it. They tended to keep men's
thoughts from purely material objects and "to correct that
absorbing worldliness, the besetting sin of the present age."
Their investigation gave comfort to those of advanced years.
Most important of all, these epiphanies might prove a powerful
lever of reform by encouraging self-improvement and coopera-
tion with one's neighbors. The author came curiously close to
the doctrine of natural rewards and punishments, embraced in
his first book written almost forty years before, when he said,
What motive to exertion in self-culture can be proposed to man more
powerful than the assurance, that not an effort to train our hearts or

moment of death. . . . Men will awake in another life, the body left
behind, and, with it, its corporeal instincts, its physical infirmities;
yet each will awake -the same individual, morally, socially, intellectu-
ally....
Such a phantom might by sound, touch, or sight make itself
perceptible to the living. But that was not its purpose. In this
second stage of life there were tasks to be performed, obliga-
tions to be fulfilled, pleasures to be enjoyed. The spirit had
still to prepare itself for the Day of Judgment. Realizing that
he had traveled far from the beaten path, the author said
curtly, with a flash of The Free Enquirer style, "All this may
sound heterodox. The more important inquiry is, whether it is
irrational." 14
Although primarily concerned with the reality, not the ad-
vantages of ultramundane intervention, Owen did not shirk the
question so often hurled at spiritualists, "Cui bono?" The
manifestations, he thought, gave assurance of immortality to
those unable to believe in it. They tended to keep men's
thoughts from purely material objects and "to correct that
absorbing worldliness, the besetting sin of the present age."
Their investigation gave comfort to those of advanced years.
Most important of all, these epiphanies might prove a powerful
lever of reform by encouraging self-improvement and coopera-
tion with one's neighbors. The author came curiously close to
the doctrine of natural rewards and punishments, embraced in
his first book written almost forty years before, when he said,
What motive to exertion in self-culture can be proposed to man more
powerful than the assurance, that not an effort to train our hearts or
u. Footfalls, 480. Cf. ibid., 478-512.

store our minds made here, in time, but has its results and its re-
wards, hereafter, in eternity? We are the architects of our own
destiny: we inflict our own punishments; we select our own re-
wards. . . . We choose: and our Choice assumes place as inexorable
judge. . . . When death calls, he neither deprives us of the virtues,
nor relieves us of the vices, of which he finds us possessed. Both
must go. Those qualities, moral, social, intellectual, which may have
distinguished us in this world will be ours also in another. . . . And
as the good, so the evil. That dark vestment of sin with which, in
man's progress through life, he may have become gradually endued
will cling to him. ... He retains his evil identity and decides his
degraded rank. ... Is there in the anticipation of a material Hell,
begirt with flames, stronger influence to deter from vice, than in the
terrible looming up of an inevitable fate like that? 15
In attempting to reconcile spiritualism with religion, Owen
revealed a curious confusion of ideas. Most of his positions
were still unorthodox. He relied on reason rather than faith
and insisted upon a material proof of immortality. His in-
terpretation of miracles was also unacceptable to zealous
churchmen. On the other hand, his book was hardly calculated
to arouse the enthusiasm of freethinkers. Eager to win addi-
tional converts and to make the new faith respectable, the
author refrained from saying aught against the clerical pro-
fession he had once scourged. A similar reversal of sentiment
was evident when he who thirty years earlier had written, "I
have often said that I thought it a waste of time and talent to
anticipate our destiny beyond the grave," now urged rational
men to concern themselves with their future existence. Owen
in 1860 spoke of the Scriptures as if they were a superior author-
ity, of God's omnipotence as if there were a God, and of the
Creator's intentions as if those could be known. Nature no
longer loomed as the ultimate criterion of right and wrong;
its place was taken by a personal deity, a fact which clearly
distinguished the younger Owen as a spiritualist from the
elder.

March. Financially the book became the most successful of
the new season.

The notices in both newspapers and periodi-

agreed that the author had handled his material with judgment
and restraint and had fashioned it into an eminently readable
essay. The Indianan's fairness, calm, and caution were par-

that this praise appeared not only in the journals of friends
like Bryant and Tilton but also in those of such old polit-

league but now a rabid anti-spiritualist, was especially re-

promised a full discussion, the Catholic did no more than call
attention to the large number of non-Christians adhering to
the new faith.

The most virulent attacks on Footfalls came not from the
daily press or the conservative magazines but from the free-

John Chappelsmith, an atheistical
scientist living at New Harmony, uncovered a lecture given by
Owen in January 1853 in which Christianity had received un-
expected praise; and he suggested that the Western Democrat
had come to believe in God as early as then. Other agnostics
remarked upon Owen's long silence on freethought topics and
hinted that this apparent step toward orthodoxy was being taken
solely for political purposes.
21
But it was not until early 1860
that the correspondents of the nation's leading heterodox jour-
nal rose in all their fury. One writer deplored that such a man,
"or rather what was a MAN," should so basely and foully pros-
titute his fine talents to bolster up blighting superstition. He
complained that the Indianan spoke "as fluently of God . . .
as if he had but recently been favored with a personal interview."
"An Observer" branded the former editor of The Free En-
quirer as a pharisee who had agreed "to shirk his Infidel prin-
ciples for the sake of obtaining political office." Chappelsmith
presented an interesting comparison of the type of evidence
demanded by Owen in his debate with Origen Bacheler with
that accepted in his new book. He vehemently denied that his
fellow townsman deserved encomiums for honesty and impar-
tiality, asserting without proof that Owen had been deluded
by Buchanan's neurological experiments in 1842 but had never
admitted the fact.

By May 1860 detraction and vilification
had become so incessant that Horace Seaver had to close his
columns to further discussion of Footfalls.

This obloquy heaped upon him by old associates could not
fail to stir the sensitive Owen. He felt especially aggrieved that,
after a long public career in which he never recanted his hetero-

he no longer sought office, of truckling to orthodoxy. To the

Owen then cited his earlier writings as not wanting in moral
courage nor a "desire to abandon truth let her lead whither she
will." These, he said, showed that he had studied the infidel
attitude toward immortality and that his present conclusions
could not be attributed to ignorance. He begged freethinkers

Owen's book was important because it was timely. After
more than a decade of ridicule and denunciation spiritualism
not only had survived but was becoming more formidable. A
new wave of interest in the subject about 1860 was evident
in the extended reviews accorded Footfalls. It was apparent in
the elaborate article, prepared by a spiritualist, in the new
encyclopedia that George Ripley and Charles A. Dana were
editing for Appleton's. It was seen in the additional definitions
offered in the latest Webster and Worcester dictionaries. It was
revealed in the tendency of believers to form a national organi-
zation. The earlier disappointments occasioned by Congress'
inaction on the mammoth memorial and by the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science's unnecessary humilia-
tion of Robert Hare were being forgotten. Spiritualist registers
were now boasting of more than 1,500,000 adherents, a thousand
meeting places, and thirty periodicals at home and abroad.

eve of secession the prospects of this new religion were
brightening. Small wonder that sincere advocates should be
carried away by the grandeur of their mission. In asking Owen
to write another volume, former United States Senator Nathaniel
P. Tallmadge said,
Nothing will do so much to benefit mankind. ... If you have the
least ambition to be remembered on earth . . . such a work will
do more for you than all you have ever done during the whole
course of your public life. ... I have served the public for nearly

The undoubted success of his first literary venture in pneu-
matology confirmed Owen's intention to remain clear of politics.
Urged on by his friends, he began to gather materials for a
second book; and except for his widely noticed debate on
divorce with Horace Greeley in the columns of the Tribune,
he dropped from public view for most of the momentous year
1860. On the evening of February 28, twenty-four hours after
his friend Bryant had introduced Abraham Lincoln to a cheer-
ing multitude at Cooper Institute, Owen was being feted by the
leading spiritualists of New York City. On May 5, two days
after his old party had adjourned from Charleston, hopelessly
split along sectional lines, he sailed aboard the Vanderbilt for
Southampton.
28
The primary purpose of this new ocean crossing was to col-
lect an old claim, apparently a personal debt, at Naples. At
the same time, however, a request by his brothers that he visit
Scotland and effect, if possible, a final sale of the family's por-
tion of the Dale estate, enabled Owen to perform a task much
closer to his heart, the supervision of an English edition of his
recent work. Just as thirty years before he had eagerly dis-
seminated his tract on contraception, so now was he anxious
to spread the results of his latest efforts to aid mankind, all the
more so since spiritualism in Great Britain was but a pale shadow
of the movement in the United States. Thus in mid-August
1860, just six weeks after the author had reached London,
Footfalls was published by Triibner, one of the leading firms
of the British capital.
29
As in the United States, Owen's volume was eagerly awaited
by freethinkers. The arrival of the American edition in the
spring of 1860 had dispelled the doubts over the Indianan's
position existing since his rumored conversion to Catholicism in

As in the United States, Owen's volume was eagerly awaited
by freethinkers. The arrival of the American edition in the
spring of 1860 had dispelled the doubts over the Indianan's
position existing since his rumored conversion to Catholicism in

At once the secular platform and press resounded with
denunciation of a new apostate. Men who had revered Owen
for the militancy of his agnosticism and for the name he bore
were astonished, dismayed, and finally enraged to find him
quoting the Scriptures he had once rejected. They blamed him,
not for repudiating his scepticism, but for failing to do it
openly, for not explaining wherein he considered his old doc-
trines at fault. To some his book seemed timid and apologetic;
to others, the vagaries of a deranged mind. By all it was re-
garded as an insult to free enquiry. In a two-page editorial
George Jacob Holyoake, a leading English secularist, lashed out
against his former idol thus:
To use Yankee language, Mr. Owen takes his place on the orthodox
"stump." He has left the free platform . . . like a deserter. . . .
No clang of arms announces his change of sides. He does not look his
old colleagues in the face. He passes from them with his head averted,
if not hanging down. One who bears so bold a name owed . . . some
courageous words in justification of his conduct when he bade farewell
to the glory of his house. It appears that when we laid down the
noble father in the churchyard of Newtown, we buried there all
that made the name of Owen an inspiration of fearlessness among
men. Robert Dale was the only hope of his race. The heroism of
that race is now suspended, if not extinct.

If criticism from the left was harsher in England than in
America, that from the right was even more so. Several of the
great quarterlies were moved by Owen's book to reexamine
spiritualism; but all agreed that the facts adduced led nowhere
and their compiler was set down as incompetent, overcredulous,
and blasphemous. Even Dickens7
weekly entered a strong
dissent, although the novelist privately expressed a genuine

Undismayed by these strictures, Owen remained abroad
well into September, continuing his research in the ultramun-
dane. At Edinburgh he despatched the business of the Dale
estate and visited with Robert Chambers, the publisher, who
manifested great interest in spiritualism. It was in the company
of the Scot that Owen sailed by the Europa from Liverpool and
reached Boston on September 21, i86o.

Although the American people were then on the eve of the
most crucial presidential election in their history, the Western
Democrat, upon his return, continued to devote his time to
intellectual pursuits. While fervid orators addressed vast
throngs on Black Republicanism and slavery, Owen sat in a
small group listening to strange rappings. While great torch-
light parades wound their way through New York's noisy
streets to win more votes for Lincoln, Douglas, or Breckin-
ridge, Owen sought in the quiet of a semi-darkened room the
truth concerning materialized spirits. While the best minds of
the nation were already puzzling over the tripartite riddle of se-
cession, coercion, and compromise, Owen was trying to explain
how a heavy dining room table could remain suspended, un-
touched, in mid-air.34
Convictions on the impending contest the
Indianan undoubtedly had, but he did not place them on record.
Nor did he return, as his followers had hoped more than a year
before, to lead the Democracy of the "Pocket" again to victory.
35
Owen, however, did not feel he was misusing his time. En-
couraged by the extensive circulation of Footfalls, he plunged
ahead on its sequel. In order to witness mediumship at its best,
he actually lived for several weeks in the autumn with the Fox
sisters at the Underbill home in New York.36

in New Harmony, a victim of constant exposure in the field
and incessant overwork in the laboratory.

Called home by
this tragic event, Owen reached Indianapolis late in the month.
There at the scene of his first political strivings he turned at
last from intellectual theories to the practical problems of the
hour. There in the Hoosier capital he found men of all parties
discussing the primary issue raised by the recent election, the
policy to be pursued toward the Southern states about to
secede from the Union.
Owen always had great confidence in the power of his pen.
Believing now that a seven-years' absence from the political
arena allowed him to write dispassionately, he published in
the leading Indianapolis papers a thoughtful, non-partisan letter
on "The Question of Coercion." In this he steered a middle
course, blaming radicals on both sides for the present crisis.
His old views on slavery had not changed. He did not go
out of his way to brand it an intolerable evil, but he certainly
did not accept the Dred Scott decision. He simply reasserted
the stand first taken in 1847, that human bondage could not
legally exist in the territories unless established there by a
positive act of Congress. As to secession, Owen denied its con-
stitutionality and upheld the right of the government to coerce
recalcitrant states into obedience. But what was right, he
pointed out, was not always expedient. The sword never con-

former allegiance. Owen warned that a baptism of blood would
but confer perpetuity upon the present quarrel.
2
This policy of permitting the erring sisters to go in peace, so
incomprehensible to a later generation, was widely held during
the confused and uncertain winter of 1860-1861. It was en-
dorsed by those who believed that a sovereign commonwealth
could not be coerced by a federal government of limited powers.
It was advocated by compromisers of all shades. It was the
last refuge of pacifists who shrank from the horror of war. No
less a Republican than Horace Greeley preferred it under
certain conditions, and the Lincoln state organ in Indiana
expressed similar views. But even before Owen's letter ap-
peared, many leaders of the victorious party had set their
faces resolutely against temporizing. In the East Bryant edi-
torially declared "Peaceable Secession an Absurdity"; while
in the West Oliver P. Morton, soon to be governor of the
Hoosier state, was ready to keep South Carolina loyal "at the
point of the bayonet." In time even Democrats came to oppose
peaceful secession as a bar to compromise.

Since 1853 political parties in Indiana had undergone a
tremendous transformation, and in the new alignment, which
found the Republicans dominant, Owen felt confused and ill
at ease. As a life-long Democrat he must have been pained
to see the well-oiled machine that had stood unchallenged upon
his departure for Naples now discordant, defeated, and well-
nigh disgraced. For the Breckinridge faction, to which Jesse
Bright and Joe Lane still clung, Owen could have little sympa-

tection in the territories. Although treated very courteously by

tion of abolitionists, nativists, protectionists, and old-line Whigs.
On slavery Owen probably stood closest to the Douglas Demo-
crats, but a new generation of politicians and editors had
replaced his former associates, and his hold upon the electorate,
even in Posey, had disappeared with time. In the end, the
intellectual failed to ally himself with any one party, and in
that failure lay both the strength and the weakness of his
political position during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
Upon reaching New Harmony early in December, Owen did
not slip back into private life. At the request of the local pub-
lisher he prepared a commentary on Buchanan's last annual
message in which he contradicted almost every argument of
the executive and concluded with a flash of realism, not again
evident for some time, that no compromise was possible if the
South were unwilling to remain in the Union as a minority
section.

Two weeks later he took a leading part at Mt. Vernon
in the largest political gathering in the county's history. All
groups were represented, and Owen was classified as a Douglas
Democrat. At a similar meeting in New Harmony on Janu-
ary 5 the ex-diplomat was again prominent, being chiefly
responsible for the resolutions that endorsed a scheme not
unlike the Crittenden proposals. In a carefully prepared speech,
"The Question of Compromise," he pointed out the necessity of
settling in the Constitution the legal status of slavery in the
territories lest the question continue to be the football of a
changing court and a changing legislature.

It was under these disheartening circumstances that Owen
went to Indianapolis on business connected with Dale's geo-

Caleb B. Smith and Richard W. Thompson, Whig rivals of
by-gone days, at a mass meeting to be held the night before
Lincoln's arrival. Unfortunately a last minute change in the
plans of the president-elect deprived Owen of utilizing that
strategic moment, and the speech had to be postponed until
after the future Emancipator had passed to the eastward.7
On the evening of February 13, 1861, Owen stood once again,
and for the last time, in the Hall of Representatives, the scene
of his earlier struggles and triumphs. Knowing that Lincoln's
words had puzzled Republicans and dissatisfied Democrats, he
made before an overflowing audience a supreme appeal for
peace. More in sorrow than in anger, he reviewed "as one no
longer engaged in public life" the causes of the existing crisis.
In his opinion there was only one issue in dispute. Every South-
ern demand regarding personal liberty acts, the fugitive slave
law, and involuntary servitude in the states he considered justi-
fied; only the insistence that the territories be opened to slavery
was unwarranted. Yet even there Owen was ready to make
some compromise in order to retain the allegiance of the Border
States. Any concession, he concluded, was, in the long run,
trifling. As a practical matter the North could and should
yield.

Presidents and politicians and office seekers, you are hurried so far
on the road of violence, that there is no return save only over fields of
civil warfare, dyed with brothers' blood. ... Up and be doing, ere
it be too late! ... If you believe that by compromise only can this

hope, for PEACE is the life of the Union.8
Historians, made wise by a knowledge of what was to be,
may call Owen's effort a "maundering tirade" or "a pathetic
appeal"; but the fact remains that no speech delivered by an
Indianan after November received greater publicity or more
generally favorable notice in the local press. It filled five
columns in the state paper of each major party, obtained full
summaries in the Indianapolis correspondence of Cincinnati
journals, and was reprinted in pamphlet form. Breckinridge
old-line guard, Douglas Democrat, and moderate Republican
all had some kind remark to make. Only the radicals were
censorious.

To be sure, Owen's words were not those of a
War Democrat, one who would support any measure designed
to bring the rebellious states to book. They were those of a
man eager for peace, above party, and willing to sacrifice, in
the best sense of the word, principle to expediency. They did
reflect the sentiments of a large number, perhaps a majority, of
the Hoosiers.
Until the very end, Owen did not cease to hope that an appeal
to arms would be averted. On February 22 he spoke again
at an Indianapolis gathering assembled "to adopt such measures
as may be calculated to prevent civil war and preserve the
Union," and there he drafted resolutions endorsing the Crit-

During the crisis of 1860-1861 Owen's course was consis-

surest way to attain his original goal. By most contemporaries,
however, his post-Sumter New Harmony editorials passed
unnoticed; and in the ensuing months he was thought of
as one who had scored abolitionists, favored peaceable seces-

and with Greeley he had openly clashed. In his desire for
peace he had on February 22 publicly associated himself

his past conservatism on the slavery issue, it was evident
that in May 1861 Owen was nowhere regarded as a War

which the war was administered in its early months. During
his first weeks in office Lincoln did nothing to place the country
in a state of preparedness. When the storm broke, the War

inadequate number of volunteers called for. Upon the indi-

also of providing them with guns, food, and clothing. Each

to discover abuses in the establishment of the arsenal ended
in a complete vindication of Owen and others. A year later an

Owen had good reason to be pleased with the results of his
work. He had done his bit for the Union cause. He had proved
that a spiritualist could also be a man of business. He had
again held a remunerative public office. He had won the good
will and respect of the governor.

Most important of all, he
had obtained a contact with the president and the cabinet
that was to make possible a higher and more significant appoint-

On March 13, 1862, Joseph Holt, Unionist member of Bu-
chanan's cabinet and a War Democrat, and Owen were chosen
by Stanton as a special committee "to audit and adjust all
contracts, orders, and claims on the War Department, in re-
spect to ordnance, arms, and ammunition." Aided by the
testimony of interested parties, they were to investigate the
validity, execution, and reasonableness of these obligations and
to report those worthy of payment. It was by this means that
the administration hoped to check, in part, the profiteering and
graft that had marked the first year of the struggle.

Owen's labors as Ordnance Commissioner were useful rather
than interesting and need not detain us long. In their final
report, dated July i, 1862., Holt and Owen declared that they
had audited, mostly by public hearings at the War Department
Building, one hundred and four contracts, amounting to
$50,000,000. By rejecting some of these and curtailing others
they had reduced the government's indebtedness by $17,000,000.
Yet in no case had they deprived a claimant of a reasonable
profit. The report scored the Cameron regime for its lax sys-
tem of issuing contracts, its violation of the law requiring public
advertisements, and its toleration of the senseless competitive
bidding between federal and state agents. Many inexplicable

able to seize the ideas of others and by persistent study or by
facility of expression disseminate them more effectively than

attainment of a life-long ambition that silence was still un-
broken on February 5, 1862. For on that day, after a sensa-

While Owen awaited a favorable opportunity for a public
endorsement of the Lincoln regime, the slavery issue again came
to the fore. The war, it will be remembered, had not been
begun to free the Negro. The Crittenden Resolution of July
1 86 1 disavowed any intention to interfere with the established
institutions of the South. Later in the year both Fremont and
Cameron were reprimanded for departing from that policy. In
1862, however, the pressure of the struggle caused a modifica-
tion of this tolerance; and in June, after preliminary steps, the
Republican goal was achieved when the territories were declared
forever free. A month later the second Confiscation Act pro-
vided for the liberation, when in Federal hands, of all slaves
of rebellious masters. Finally on July 22 the president dis-

antecedents and his life-long hatred of slavery. Formerly he
had believed that non-interference was the wisest course for
such a Northerner to pursue, but the necessity for terminating
the suicidal struggle had forced him to alter his opinion. The
Indianan did not say that emancipation was the only means
of ending the war; he did consider it the sole guarantee against
its resumption. In the government's acknowledged power to

delay would encourage a military cabal to reorganize the cabi-

Owen declared, "approaches." "It is within your power . . .

if only because men at the time believed it had "a potent in-
fluence in producing the proclamation." One Negrophile went
so far as to call it the origin of that act.
35
What Lincoln thought
of Owen's words was not divulged, but Chase was certain that
they could not fail to impress him. "You will hardly ever,"
he wrote, "accomplish a greater work than this letter. . . .
[It] thrilled me like a bugle call; and when published ... I
hope it may be a trumpet of resurrection. . . ." Modestly Owen
responded saying, if it had influence, "I shall think of it with
as much pleasure as of any act of my life; and if it had not,
I am glad it was not needed."
36
Believing that Lincoln's proclamation must eventuate in gen-
eral manumission, Owen continued to agitate for compensated
emancipation in the Border States. First he revised his second
formal letter, the one to Chase, and had it published as the
"Conditions of a Lasting Peace." Then he issued through
Lippincott's a forty-eight-page pamphlet containing all three
epistles and entitled The Policy of Emancipation. In still an-
other tract the following year he pointed out the importance
of supplementing the president's action by Congressional legis-
lation. The details of such a law he sketched in an elaborate
article in The Atlantic Monthly for July i863.
37
With his work as pamphleteer for emancipation ends the
first phase of Owen's Civil War activity. Through his writings
he had earned the title of War Democrat. Once again Bryant
could call him, as he had in the mid-forties, "one of our most

of Owen's words was not divulged, but Chase was certain that
they could not fail to impress him. "You will hardly ever,"
he wrote, "accomplish a greater work than this letter... .
[It] thrilled me like a bugle call; and when published ... I
hope it may be a trumpet of resurrection. . . ." Modestly Owen
responded saying, if it had influence, "I shall think of it with
as much pleasure as of any act of my life; and if it had not,
I am glad it was not needed." 36
Believing that Lincoln's proclamation must eventuate in gen-
eral manumission, Owen continued to agitate for compensated
emancipation in the Border States. First he revised his second
formal letter, the one to Chase, and had it published as the
"Conditions of a Lasting Peace." Then he issued through
Lippincott's a forty-eight-page pamphlet containing all three
epistles and entitled The Policy of Emancipation. In still an-
other tract the following year he pointed out the importance
of supplementing the president's action by Congressional legis-
lation. The details of such a law he sketched in an elaborate
article in The Atlantic Monthly for July r863.37
With his work as pamphleteer for emancipation ends the
first phase of Owen's Civil War activity. Through his writings
he had earned the title of War Democrat. Once again Bryant
could call him, as he had in the mid-forties, "one of our most
distinguished statesmen"; and for the first time Greeley was

upon the second and more radical phase, Owen was something
of a political jack-of-all-trades. He lobbied in Congress for
legislation favorable to Indiana. He served temporarily as
assistant secretary of war and seemed slated for a permanent
post. Chase used him as a mouthpiece.

at the prompting of the Hoosier executive that he turned his

Owen's attitude toward the alleged plot to reconstruct the
nation without the New England states was the supreme test
of his War Democracy. That any large number of responsible
Indiana Democrats in February 1863 advocated reunion with
the Secessionists at the expense of their Northeastern allies is
difficult to believe. Undoubtedly Davis and his command would
have liked to detach the Hoosier state and its neighbors from
the seaboard regions, and it cannot be denied that secret so-
cieties had already begun to flourish in the Old Northwest.39

of Indiana entitled, The Future of the North-West: in Connec-
tion with the Scheme of Reconstruction without New England*
This tract gave no evidence of treason in Indiana. In many
ways it was more of a plea than an accusation. The author was
too wise to glorify New England or defend emancipation before
a Hoosier audience. Instead he concentrated his attack upon
the South, painting a dark picture of its way of life and placing
the war guilt at its door. An alliance with the Secessionists, he
said, would be not a compromise but a confession of failure. It
would give the rebels political control of the new Union. It
would permit them to strike down the Negro exclusion clause
in the Indiana constitution. It would ultimately lead to civil
war in the Hoosier state.
Let there be no deception [he warned] . If we are to do this thing,
let us look it honestly in the face. . . . Let Indiana , . . resolve to
purchase Southern favor by Northern dismemberment . . . but let
her know . . . that her road will lie over the bodies of her murdered
sons, past prostrate cabins, past ruined farms. . . . Let her know
that before she can link her fate to a system . . . doomed to ultimate
extinction, there will be war within her own borders, to which all we
have yet endured, will be but as the summer's gale . . .

Thanks to Parke Godwin and other influential Union leaders,
Owen's essay was printed as the first pamphlet of the newly

EMANCIPATION, as the moderates had warned, created as many
problems as it removed. One of the most important of these
during the remainder of the war was the treatment of freed-
men under Federal control. On March 16, 1863, therefore,
Stanton named Owen and two other strong Unionists
to investigate the condition of the colored population emancipated by
acts of Congress and the President's proclamation ... to report
what measures will best contribute to their protection and improve-
ment, so that they may defend and support themselves ;
and also how
they can be most usefully employed in the service of the government
for the suppression of the Rebellion.1
The appointment of this American Freedmen's Inquiry Com-
mission, long demanded by the Negrophiles, comprising Owen,
James McKaye, an original sponsor of the Loyal Publication
Society, and Samuel Gridley Howe, humanitarian friend of the
Boston abolitionists, to deal with a subject distasteful to most
Indiana Republicans and all Hoosier Democrats, properly
marked the beginning of the second and more radical phase
of Owen's Civil War activity.
Highly pleased to hold again a remunerative public office,
Owen entered upon his new duties with characteristic enthusi-
asm. Since Stanton had left the details to the commissioners,
the chairman grandly planned to study the status of the liber-
ated blacks not only in Virginia and the lower Mississippi
Valley but also in the British West Indies. In April headquar-

Street, a mile or so from the old Hall of Science. Much of the

men." This scheme envisaged the creation in the Southern
seaboard states of three departments, each controlled by a

entire system was to be governed by a Superintendent-General,
chosen by the president from officers of brigadier grade. The
purpose of this form of guardianship, admittedly temporary,
was to enable the former bondmen to learn by working aban-
doned farms and plantations how to support themselves. They
were, however, to have no connection with the regular army

Owen's final report of May 15, 1864, was broader and more
philosophical in nature. It discussed at length the history of
slavery in the Western Hemisphere, the wisdom of emancipa-
tion, and the future of the colored race in the United States.
Involuntary servitude was portrayed as a political, social, and
moral evil, responsible above any other single factor for the
Civil War. Manumission was considered in its humanitarian
and legal aspects. With regard to the future position of the
freedmen in American society the author was optimistic. He
did not say that the blacks would be accepted as social equals,
but he did believe that the war had dissipated the popular
notion that a Negro was by nature intellectually and morally
inferior to the white. He hoped and he expected that the
geniality, humility, and innate kindness of the African would
temper the harshness of the American national character.

The question of printing a document so glowing in its delinea-
tion of the ex-slave precipitated a stormy debate in the Senate.
Already the preliminary report had appeared in the daily
press, being greeted with approbation by the radicals and viru-
lent denunciation by the Democrats.6
In the upper house
Charles Sumner, vociferously seconded by Ben Wade, cham-
pioned a motion to publish 3,000 extra copies of the survey.
"I have no hesitation in saying," he declared, "that it is one of
the most able contributions to this question that has ever ap-
peared in this country or in any other country." Thomas A.
Hendricks, who thirteen years before had helped Owen write
the Negro exclusion clause into the Indiana constitution, led
the opposition. The chief arguments used were that the motion
was unwarranted, the commission illegal, and the findings un-
authoritative. One Senator took the position that nothing
worthy of public attention could be written by the author of
Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World. The Republi-
cans eventually carried the day, but their rivals saw in the vote
an intention to turn Owen's essay into a campaign document.7
Even before Sumner had triumphed in the Senate, Owen
had decided to publish the report in book form under his own
name. He was impelled to do this less from fear that his brain
child would molder in the War Department archives than from
a desire to present in a condensed volume, "which busy men
may read in a few hours/' the facts and law bearing upon a
momentous national question.

pioned a motion to publish 3,000 extra copies of the survey.
"I have no hesitation in saying," he declared, "that it is one of
the most able contributions to this question that has ever ap-
peared in this country or in any other country." Thomas A.
Hendricks, who thirteen years before had helped Owen write
the Negro exclusion clause into the Indiana constitution, led
the opposition. The chief arguments used were that the motion
was unwarranted, the commission illegal, and the findings un-
authoritative. One Senator took the position that nothing
worthy of public attention could be written by the author of
Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World. The Republi-
cans eventually carried the day, but their rivals saw in the vote
an intention to turn Owen's essay into a campaign document.7
Even before Sumner had triumphed in the Senate, Owen
had decided to publish the report in book form under his own
name. He was impelled to do this less from fear that his brain
child would molder in the War Department archives than from
a desire to present in a condensed volume, "which busy men
may read in a few hours," the facts and law bearing upon a
momentous national question.8 As with Hints on Public Archi-

was mentioned among the candidates from whom the first head
would be chosen. Thanks to John Wilkes Booth, the final
selection was entrusted not to Lincoln but to an old Congres-
sional foe, and early in May 1865 Andrew Johnson named
General Oliver O. Howard, commander of the army in Ten-
nessee. A few days before this news reached him, Owen learned
at second hand that Lincoln had once informed Sumner of his
intention to appoint the Hoosier to that position. There is a
little evidence to substantiate that rumor, but it probably
signifies nothing more than the Emancipator's high opinion of
Owen. It had long been forecast that a military man would
head the new Bureau, and the failure of certain appropriations
made that step a necessity.

Much of the time he spent in the West on private business. In

the war and frankly confessed the error of his own pacific

that would carry the Manifesto of January i to its logical
conclusion. He early took the stand that the Confederate
states should not be readmitted to the Union until they had
agreed never to reestablish slavery. To justify that position,
he elaborated a "forfeited rights" doctrine, not unlike Sum-
ner's "state suicide" theory, which during the autumn of 1863
he urged upon Lincoln in print and in person.

His ideas on
Negro suffrage were particularly advanced, for there was a
strong implication in both the final report on the refugee
freedmen and in The Wrong of Slavery that the blacks should
receive the franchise immediately. In an often overlooked
public letter to Johnson on June 21, 1865, the Indianan went
even farther. In a rather demagogic manner he protested
against the increased representation that the South would en-
joy in Congress as soon as the three-fifths ratio was abolished.
He was unwilling that each voter in the late rebellious states
possess thrice the political power of each elector among his
recent conquerors and demanded that the organic law of North
Carolina and her sisters be rejected if the ballot was withheld
from the ex-slave. The following November, in a second
public letter, Owen handled the same problem in a more bal-
anced fashion. He proposed a constitutional amendment giving
the federal government the power to determine the qualifica-
tions of all voters participating in presidential and Congres-
sional elections, specifically requiring a literacy test and
definitely prohibiting discrimination because of color. He
would make its ratification a prerequisite to the readmission

On the con-
trary it afforded additional evidence of the radical tenor of
its author's thought. To be sure, the Hoosier was not one
who would place the prostrate cotton kingdom under military
rule. He had no particular desire to maintain any group of
men in power, though he did sincerely believe that the un-
reconciled, unadjusted Southern Democrat could not be as
intensely loyal as the Northern Republican. But on Negro
suffrage he was ahead of his time. He insisted that the ballot
be conferred upon the freedmen even if it had to be done under
federal authority. Yet relatively few influential men in either
party were willing to entrust the ex-slave with the franchise
in any form, and therein lies the explanation for the vicissi-
tudes of Owen's subsequent draft of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment.
During the winter of 1865-1866 a bitter struggle, almost
unparalled in our history, was waged between the president
and Congress for control of Reconstruction policies. In this
contest Owen took no part, but he did watch with increasing
interest and anxiety the futile attempts of the legislature to
devise some formula for restoring the rebellious states to the
Union. When by mid-April at least three different proposals
had failed to find favor and both Democrats and Republicans

plan to Thaddeus Stevens, who promptly pronounced it the
best he had yet seen. The Pennsylvanian was reluctant to
postpone giving the ballot to the freedmen, but he admitted
that neither house would accept immediate Negro suffrage.
Personally he thought the accompanying bill too lenient but
promised to submit both it and the amendment to the Joint
Committee of Fifteen. Owen found the chairman of that body,
William Pitt Fessenden;
less enthusiastic but equally of the
opinion that no better proposal had yet been presented. Most
of his Republican colleagues also gave a more or less qualified
approval, but the Democrats held back. Charles Sumner, not
a member of the Fifteen, was strongly opposed to his friend's
project, refusing to compromise with immediate suffrage even
though he had no hope of success then or in the very near
future. One conversation on the subject Owen, curiously
enough, failed to recall. That was his interview with the
president on the evening of April 17. It is not difficult to sur-
mise that the two men found themselves in as complete a dis-
agreement on the matter as they had on the Smithsonian
Institution twenty years before.

This private discussion of Owen's plan coincided with the
growing public demand that Congress take some positive ac-
tion. On Monday April 16, the day before the Indianan's
conference at the White House, the Joint Committee assembled
for the first time in six weeks. Nothing was accomplished; but
at its next meeting, on Saturday the twenty-first, Stevens sub-
mitted a plan of Reconstruction, not of his own framing, but
one which he would support. It was Owen's. No final decision
was reached at that time; but except for the addition of a
clause similar to the present one on "privileges and immuni-
ties," fathered by Representative Bingham, the original draft
was approved without material change. Owen's accompanying
bill met with little favor; but on April 25 the committee, after
eliminating Bingham's provision, formally decided by a vote

This private discussion of Owen's plan coincided with the
growing public demand that Congress take some positive ac-
tion. On Monday April r6, the day before the Indianan's
conference at the White House, the Joint Committee assembled
for the first time in six weeks. Nothing was accomplished; but
at its next meeting, on Saturday the twenty-first, Stevens sub-
mitted a plan of Reconstruction, not of his own framing, but
one which he would support. It was Owen's. No final decision
was reached at that time; but except for the addition of a
clause similar to the present one on "privileges and immuni-
ties," fathered by Representative Bingham, the original draft
was approved without material change. Owen's accompanying
bill met with little favor; but on April 25 the committee, after
eliminating Bingham's provision, formally decided by a vote
1• "Political Results from the Varioloid," lac. cit., XXXV, 663-665; Owen

370 ROBERT DALE OWEN
of seven to six to report the Hoosier's amendment to Congress.
As the members were about to disperse, a motion to reconsider
that vote was offered and finally agreed to, apparently so as
not to offend Chairman Fessenden, then confined to his room
with the varioloid. In the two-day interval before the next
session something happened, for on Saturday the 28th Owen's
draft was amended beyond all recognition. Bingham's broad
clause giving the federal government jurisdiction over civil
rights was restored, a new section on representation was in-
troduced, and Owen's specific provision for Negro suffrage
after 1876 was omitted. This more conservative version was
presented to the legislature on the last day of April and after
further modification was sent to the states for ratification as
the Fourteenth Amendment.20
The reason for this sudden reversal was that Owen's scheme
was too radical. Such was the explanation given to its author
by Stevens, and his statement was amply confirmed in the
contemporary press. Even before its introduction in the com-
mittee, Owen's proposal, in all its essential details, was pub-
lished in the Chicago Tribune. On April 23 the New York
World gave an equally complete description, terming it the
most radical project yet suggested. This notoriety made pos-
sible partisan criticism before the committee reached its final
decision. On April 25 the Democratic World editorially pro-
claimed "Robert Dale Owen's Plan of Reconstruction" as the
leading issue in the fall elections. The supposedly impartial
Herald indulged during four consecutive days in a campaign
of mockery and vituperation, in which Owen's career was
reviewed at length from his first fling as an ultra-reformer in
New York until the time he entered the war a spiritualist and
emerged "a radical with all the modern improvements and
more too." Bennett's writers did not hesitate to associate the
quondam opponent of the Wilmot Proviso with such men as

asserted, that after the war Owen opposed giving the blacks
the ballot at once. On the contrary, he clearly preferred to

a prospective franchise as a compromise. Even then he sought
to penalize those states which kept the ex-slaves from the polls
before i876.

All contemporary evidence points to the con-

Yet for more than one reason it is regrettable that Owen's

essentially sound policy. Owen's phraseology avoided a recog-

would have been more charitable to disfranchise the Con-
federate leaders, as he wished, in a separate bill rather than
in the Constitution. It would have been wiser to avoid the
ambiguous "due process" clause that has done so much to
protect vested interests and to prevent, in the words of Justice

own reasons for accepting were chiefly financial; as early as
1864 the Hoosier was greatly concerned over pecuniary mat-
ters.
27
In his new capacity Owen's efforts were directed along three
main lines. First in point of time, he helped to publicize the
bond issue that Corlies & Co. were trying to float. On Novem-
ber 2, 1865, he attended the gala opening of Tifft's Mexican
Financial Agency at 57 Broadway, New York; and there, sur-
rounded by swarthy diplomats and comic opera generals, he
spoke briefly on the danger inherent in an empire to the south.
28
A few days later, in order to encourage hesitant investors, he
went to Washington to secure in person from the president
some assurance that Maximilian would never be recognized.
29
When all these stratagems failed to sell the bonds, Owen tried,
among other things, to interest Jay Cooke in disposing of the
loan. In January 1866, for a time, the Philadelphia banker
seemed to look with favor upon the project; but as he hesi-
tated, he received friendly advice from the secretary of the
treasury to steer clear of the enterprise. As a result, the banker
decided not to commit himself but to keep Tifft and Owen, those
"Mexicans" as he called them, in "tow" for a while longer.
30
The most important and the most onerous phase of Owen's
activity was his attempt to wring from Congress a formal
guarantee to repay bondholders of the $40,000,000 loan should
the Mexican government fail to do so. In his efforts to lobby
such a bill through the legislature the Hoosier had two more
interviews with the president, wrote appealing letters to Charles
Sumner, testified in person before the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, and sought to persuade ex-Governor Andrew
of Massachusetts to act as counsel for Mexico. The Indianan's

measure.33
But the chief stumbling block, both during the
spring of 1866 and at the end of the year when the scheme
was broached again, was the opposition of such influential
statesmen as Sumner, McCulloch, and above all, Seward. From
the first, the secretary of state believed that Napoleon intended
to withdraw his troops from below the Rio Grande, and he
wanted no excuse to be given that would cause him to change
his mind. Matias Romero, the shrewd Mexican minister, real-
ized that fact and as early as March 1866 advised Tifft to
abandon the idea of a guarantee. When Owen began to talk
of the United States acquiring more Mexican soil, Romero
was certain that the wrong approach was being used.
34
Thus
the expiring contract with Corlies & Co. was not renewed at
the end of 1866 and by the next spring Owen's connection with
Tifft appears to have ceased. After the execution of Maximilian
had placed Juarez and his cause under a cloud, little more
was heard of Owen's interest in Mexican affairs; and this
curious episode, perhaps the least commendable in a long
career, was conveniently forgotten when the Indianan came
to write his reminiscences.

As a footnote to the Mexican bonds incident may be added
Owen's tenuous connection with Jay Cooke's activities in the
spring of 1866. At that time the Philadelphian was using every
weapon of propaganda from his well-stocked armory to pass
a refunding law with five per cent bonds tax exempt. On the
same day Joseph Medill telegraphed his "scoop" of Owen's
draft amendment to the Chicago Tribune, Henry Cooke sug-
gested to his brother that they enlist the Hoosier's services in
the fight for the exemption clause, saying, "He could, I think,
work effectively. He is indefatigable, is known to be sincere

known. In many ways Owen had become as prominent on
the national political scene as when he represented the First
District of Indiana. If he now accomplished less, it was be-
cause he stood alone, a free lance as it were. It was because
when he spoke or wrote, he was speaking or writing for Robert
Dale Owen and not for any party, section, or electorate.
41
But the Owen of the sixties was not the Owen of the forties.
He had passed the meridian of his life. Agnosticism had yielded
to faith. The "betrayer of freedom" had become the champion
of the Negro. The fiery ordeal of secession had tempered a
state rights philosophy with a stronger nationalism. Most
complete of all was the break with former associates in In-
diana. To a six-year absence abroad was now added an ex-
tended residence in the East. No longer did Owen visit the
state university. No longer did he initiate improvements in
New Harmony. No longer did he assemble with party con-
ventions at Indianapolis. He ceased to find friends among the
Lanes, Chapmans, or Pettits. Those who had once called him
the purest man in the state now made sport of his alleged free
love principles and dared him to preach Negro suffrage in the
commonwealth from which he had helped exclude the colored
race. The same editor who had described him a decade before
as laborious and practical now dismissed him as an incurable
visionary and constant failure.
42
To such strictures Owen paid
scant heed; he had found new friends and a new purpose in
living. He now mingled with a Chase, a Sumner, a Bryant,
or an Edmonds. By them he was esteemed for his sterling
patriotism, his able pen, his charming company, and his un-
questioning belief in a future existence. If Owen the Western
Democrat had lost repute among Hoosier politicians, Owen the
intellectual had gained it among Eastern literary people and
Christian spiritualists. With each of these last two classes he
was to spend the remaining decade of his life.

THE DEBATABLE LAND
RENEWED participation in national affairs had not destroyed
Owen's deep faith in a future life. Even during the stirring
days of civil strife he continued to pioneer in the debatable
land. Interspersed with his writings on secession, emancipa-
tion, and Negro suffrage were articles on the ultramundane.
Political opponents ridiculed this new belief as they had once
scored his unbelief; but the white-haired, genial, and garrulous
sexagenarian was more immune to personal criticism than the
Western Democrat of the thirties. After the final termination
of his public career early in 1867 Owen found an outlet for
his boundless energy in the study and propagation of his new
religion. Humanitarian crusades might attract his attention
for a time and economic needs might force him into literary
ventures, but the predominant interest of his last decade was
spiritualism.
Spiritualism had not enjoyed an uninterrupted growth dur-
ing the war. Like other reform movements it had been dealt a
body blow by the internecine struggle. The efforts of its leaders
were diverted to other channels, regular meetings were sparsely
attended, and the rising cost of paper discouraged new pub-
lications.

Yet the arbitrament of the sword was not an un-
mitigated evil. By making death a stark reality to this
generation, it sowed the seeds of a vigorous spiritualistic
renascence. Scarcely a home in the land failed to suffer some
bereavement, and thousands sought solace in communication
with the departed loved ones.
This post-bellum revival was abundantly attested. A mass
meeting at Chicago in August 1864 initiated an unbroken series
of annual conventions and led four years later to the formation

Owen remained aloof from organized spiritualism. He never
attended national conventions and was present but once, and
then for a specific purpose, at a state gathering. He seldom
contributed to the spiritualist press and declined to use his
unquestioned journalistic talent to improve its tone. Although
after 1867 he spoke frequently on his favorite topic to private
groups and lyceum audiences, he did not rival Warren Chase,
Andrew J. Davis, or other frequenters of the spiritualist ros-
trum. Yet this reserve stemmed only in part from his life-long
hostility to associational activity. There was much in the
movement that he found distasteful. Its literature wanted cul-
ture and exactness, and the lax check made of the morality
of mediums encouraged cheats and charlatans to hover like
vultures on the fringes of the new faith. Professional believers
he especially disliked. "Money changers," he declared, "are
out of place in the spiritual temple. Man's destiny is to earn

The key to Owen's attitude is to be found in the tendency

it was often asserted, could ignore other humanitarian move-

creeds and to synthesize all reforms.

and woman suffrage, Indian, prison and dress reform, world
peace, temperance, and industrial education. In their denun-
ciation of Sabbatarianism, the use of the Bible in state institu-
tions, and the agitation to put God in the Constitution the
spiritualists rivalled extreme freethinkers. To one who was
striving to make the belief a respectable, bourgeois Christian
religion such resolutions seemed both extraneous and unwise.

ciation of Spiritualists of Victoria Claflin Woodhull, the most
ignorant, notorious, and radical feminist of the day, one who
had until then manifested no interest in spiritualism and who
did not even know the correct name of the organization that
thus honored her, seemed to Owen the logical result of the
trend he was combatting. To the new executive's declaration
that what slavery had been to the abolitionist, the woman
question would henceforth be to the spiritualist, the Indianan
entered a vigorous public dissent.

address, delivered at Terre Haute on the twenty-fourth anni-

new faith and denied the right of self-constituted conventions
to speak for all believers. He specifically warned them against
meddling in other humanitarian movements.9

Like its predecessor. The Debatable Land was a stout volume
of more than five hundred pages, well indexed and documented,
and issued on both sides of the Atlantic by reputable publishing
houses. Almost a third of its contents consisted of a prefatory
address to the Protestant clergy, discussing the ecclesiasti-
cal attitude toward miracles, infallibility, and the discoveries of
modern science. Professing great alarm at the relative decline
of Protestantism before the onrush of a revived Catholicism
and a militant secularism, the former editor of The Free En-
quirer offered spiritualsim as a necessary adjunct to orthodox
faiths. Its epiphanies he regarded as identical in kind with the
marvels that had astonished the disciples and biographers of
Jesus. They afforded palpable proof of immortality, the great-
est religious need of the nineteenth century. Undoubtedly the
author believed that he was spiritualizing Christianity, but the
tendency of his argument was to Christianize spiritualism.
Quite bluntly he declared,
Spiritualism is the complement of Christianity. Spiritual phenomena
are the witnesses of Christianity. All thoughtful believers will be
Christians as soon as they learn to distinguish between the simple
grandeur of Christ's teachings, . . . and the Augustinian version
of St. Paul's theology.

An ally of Christianity, not a substitute, was Owen's faith.
The Indianan wanted no formal spiritualist creed, no separate
spiritualist church. He hoped that its doctrines would soften
the asperities of existing sects and afford consolation to the
aged. As always, Owen rejected the idea of innate depravity,
the divine inspiration of the Bible, and the orthodox explana-
tion of miracles. The world, he now thought, was ruled by
a loving God; and Christ was elevated by him above Socrates
as the greatest teacher known to man. The basic propositions
which all spiritualists accepted he listed under fourteen heads.
One existence, these declared, followed immediately upon the
other, and the life stage was essentially one of preparation.

Man's initial state in each sphere was determined not by pre-
destination but by his record in the preceding one. The indi-
vidual retained his original personality during this progress
and found himself under the same natural laws that governed
mundane affairs. Some communication between the living and
the deceased, these propositions continued, undoubtedly ex-
isted. At worst it might provide idle gossip and even false-
hoods. At best it supplied valuable guides for conduct in this
world and tangible evidence of a life to come.
21
The larger part of Owen's book was devoted to physical
manifestations. He approached the question of table-tipping
and materialization with the feeling of Sir John Herschel, who
had once written, "Occurrences which, according to received
opinions, ought not to happen, are the facts which serve as
clues to new discoveries."
22
In thus discussing phenomena
evoked by mediums, paid and unpaid, rather than those taking
place spontaneously, the author went far beyond his earlier
work. His findings were more sensational and controversial
and, being based partly upon his own experience, more per-
sonal. Throughout, however, the writer sought to maintain
the scientific attitude, even going so far as to criticize the
evolutionary hypothesis.
23
But although in this new volume,
as in the old, Owen insisted that witnesses place their testimony
in writing, many accounts were recorded at second or third
hand in a manner unacceptable to modern students of psychical
research. The author's own crude method of investigation is
revealed in the following excerpt which, however, profoundly
impressed English spiritualists:
It was on the evening of Sunday, the twenty-first of October, 1860.

Man's initial state in each sphere was determined not by pre-
destination but by his record in the preceding one. The indi-
vidual retained his original personality during this progress
and found himself under the same natural laws that governed
mundane affairs. Some communication between the living and
the deceased, these propositions continued, undoubtedly ex-
isted. At worst it might provide idle gossip and even false-
hoods. At best it supplied valuable guides for conduct in this
world and tangible evidence of a life to come.21
The larger part of Owen's book was devoted to physical
manifestations. He approached the question of table-tipping
and materialization with the feeling of Sir John Herschel, who
had once written, "Occurrences which, according to received
opinions, ought not to happen, are the facts which serve as
clues to new discoveries." 22 In thus discussing phenomena
evoked by mediums, paid and unpaid, rather than those taking
place spontaneously, the author went far beyond his earlier
work. His findings were more sensational and controversial
and, being based partly upon his own experience, more per-
sonal. Throughout, however, the writer sought to maintain
the scientific attitude, even going so far as to criticize the
evolutionary hypothesis.23 But although in this new volume,
as in the old, Owen insisted that witnesses place their testimony
in writing, many accounts were recorded at second or third
hand in a manner unacceptable to modern students of psychical
research. The author's own crude method of investigation is
revealed in the following excerpt which, however, profoundly
impressed English spiritualists:
It was on the evening of Sunday, the twenty-first of October, 1860.
The sitting was held in Mr. Underhill's dining-room, lasting from
ten till eleven o'clock P. M.
The room was lighted by gas. There were two windows fronting
the street; three doors.... Before we had any demonstrations the
raps requested us to wait until the domestics had retired. There

upstairs to bed. . . .
Before commencing the session, at Mr. Underbill's request, I
shut and locked the three doors above referred to, leaving the keys
in the doors; so that no one, even if furnished with keys, could open
them from without. I satisfied myself, by careful personal inspection
. . . that there was no one in the pantry, nor any one in the dining-
room except the three persons who, along with myself, assisted at
the sitting.
These persons were Mr. Daniel Underbill, Mrs. Underbill (Leah
Fox) ,
and her nephew, Charles, twelve years old. We sat down to a
centre-table. ... (I bad previously looked under it; nothing to be
seen there.) . . .
The rappings commenced, gradually increasing in number and
force. After a short interval they spelled: "Put out the gas." It was
accordingly extinguished and the room remained in total darkness.
Then, "Join hands." Shortly after doing so I felt several times, a
cool breeze blowing on my cheek. Then was spelled: "Do not break

We obeyed; and, except for a second or two at a time,
it remained, on my part unbroken throughout the rest of the sitting.
After a few minutes I perceived a light, apparently of a phos-
phorescent character, on my left, near the floor. . . . For a time it
moved about . . . then it rose into the air and floated . . . over our
heads.
After a time it changed its appearance. ... It then resembled an
opaque oval substance, about the size of a child's head, muffled up in
the folds of some very white and shining material. ... As it moved
about, I began to hear ... the rustling as of a silk dress, or of other
light article of female apparel. . . . Then the light passed behind
Mrs. Underbill; then I saw it close to Mr. Underbill and just oppo-
site me. Mr. Underbill said: "Can you not go to Mr, Owen; do try."
Thereupon it moved slowly around to my left side. This time the
folds appeared to have dropped; and what seemed a face . . . came
bending down within five or six inches of my own. ... As it ap-
proached, I plainly distinguished the semi-luminous outline of an
entire figure of the usual female stature. ... I could distinguish
no features: nor were the outlines of the body . . .
sharply defined.
While this was taking place I held Mrs. Underbill's band and
Charles's. As the various phases of the phenomena succeeded each
other, I remarked on what I saw; and Mr. Underbill, from the
opposite side of the table, responded to my remarks; so that I am

I expressed a wish that the figure would touch me; and Mr.
Underhill said, from his place: "We are very anxious that the spirit
should touch Mr. Owen, if it can."
Thereupon I felt what seemed a human hand laid on my head.
And?
as I looked steadily at the figure, which stood on my left side, I
saw its head. ... A moment afterward I felt, and simultaneously
heard, just behind the point of that shoulder, a kiss imprinted.
I could not, for any physical fact, obtain the evidence of three
senses sight, touch, and hearing more distinctly than in this
case I did.

Suddenly we heard a noise as of the door opposite to me being
unlocked; then of its being hastily opened and shut; then the
rustling sound approached me on the left, and a key was laid on my
left hand. Then a second door was heard to be unlocked in the same
way;
and I heard another key laid on the table just before me. Then
a third door. . . .
While we were conversing, there was a rattling of the crockery in
the cupboard. Mrs. Underhill expressed her apprehensions as to
some favorite china, but Mr. Underhill replied: "I will trust the
spirits;" and then added: "Cannot the spirit bring something to Mr.
Owen?" Almost immediately there was set down on the table, close
to my left hand, some object which I touched, and it proved to be a
cut-glass goblet.
* # * *
When, soon after, we were bidden, by the raps, to relight the gas,
I found the three door-keys on the table, the goblet also. . . . Both
the room-doors were closed, but on trying them, I found that neither
was locked. Two of the keys on the table fitted them. . . .
These are the facts, all briefly noted down the same evening on
which they happened, and written out in full the next morning.

However inadequate such evidence may seem today, it excited
widespread interest among Owen's contemporaries. Like Foot-
falls, The Debatable Land became at once a best-seller. The
first American edition was exhausted in ten days, and a month
later four thousand copies had been sold.

asked for further study was in itself a triumph for spiritualists.

spiritual origin to the manifestations or see in them a means
of revitalizing Christianity. Some rejoiced that the former

that he now possessed evidence of a future life that he had
lacked in his younger days and that his pioneering in the
outer fringes of the human intellect entitled him to the name

deemed belief in immortality a necessary prerequisite for re-

The reception accorded Owen's second volume enables one
to mark the progress of spiritualism. In 1860 Orestes Brown-

character of the belief. More than nine pages of The Catholic
World were required to reiterate that opinion in 1872. The

negligence of his scientific colleagues, and the endorsement
by a famous chemist, William Crookes, of the idea of a psychic
force.
33
Led on by the revelations in Owen's work, Crookes
continued his experiments until in 1874, he too, like Wallace,
publicly accepted the spiritual theory.
34
Across the Atlantic similar milestones were being passed.
In 1870 and 1871 came the first full length history of spiritual-
ism and the first large-scale annual devoted to the cause. Both
publications sadly lacked impartiality and accuracy, but they
sold well and impressed their readers with the longevity of the
movement.35
Early in 1872 Owen wrote the thesis of his De-
batable Land into an article for Johnson's forthcoming en-
cyclopedia, and a few years later Epes Sargent was selected to
contribute the account on spiritualism in the new edition of
Ripley and Dana.36
Notable attempts to improve the quality
of spiritual periodicals were made in 1872 by Emma Britten's
short-lived Western Star, a monthly, and in 1873 by S. B. Brit-
tan's more ambitious Journal of Spiritual Science, a quarterly.
Sensational physical manifestations, rivalling the more sci-
entific experiments of Crookes with Katie King, the spirit of
John Morgan's daughter, were obtained at this time by Mrs.
Mary Andrews at Moravia, the Eddy brothers at Chittenden,
Vermont, and Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Holmes in Philadelphia.
Widespread discussion in popular magazines and newspapers
marked this flood tide of spiritualism. A New York daily

Dialectical Society report, another attack by Wallace upon the
negligence of his scientific colleagues, and the endorsement
by a famous chemist, William Crookes, of the idea of a psychic
force.33 Led on by the revelations in Owen's work, Crookes
continued his experiments until in r874, he too, like Wallace,
publicly accepted the spiritual theory.34
Across the Atlantic similar milestones were being passed.
In r870 and r87r came the first full length history of spiritual-
ism and the first large-scale annual devoted to the cause. Both
publications sadly lacked impartiality and accuracy, but they
sold well and impressed their readers with the longevity of the
movement.35 Early in 1872 Owen wrote the thesis of his De-
batable Land into an article for Johnson's forthcoming en-
cyclopedia, and a few years later Epes Sargent was selected to
contribute the account on spiritualism in the new edition of
Ripley and Dana.36 Notable attempts to improve the quality
of spiritual periodicals were made in 1872 by Emma Britten's
short-lived Western Star, a monthly, and in 1873 by S. B. Brit-
tan's more ambitious Journal of Spiritual Science, a quarterly.
Sensational physical manifestations, rivalling the more sci-
entific experiments of Crookes with Katie King, the spirit of
John Morgan's daughter, were obtained at this time by Mrs.
Mary Andrews at Moravia, the Eddy brothers at Chittenden,
Vermont, and Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Holmes in Philadelphia.

marked this flood tide of spiritualism. A New York daily

THE study of pneumatology was for the aging Owen a con-
genial task. "It is good/' he repeatedly said, "to take with
us through life a great and encouraging subject. We feel this
the more as we advance in years." Spiritualism gave the In-
dianan a buoyant confidence in facing the Unknown. In 1873
he bluntly confessed that he would feel less cheerful if he had
not discovered unmistakable proof of a future existence.
1
Owen, however, was no solitary mystic, insensible to the
pleasures and problems of this world. Gregarious by nature,
he owned a wide circle of friends among non-spiritualists. Con-
temporaries pictured him as a genial, courteous, and exceed-
ingly well-informed gentleman, free from the slightest trace
of dogmatism and possessed of "that rare social gift, the abil-
ity to make his companions interesting to themselves and to
him." 2
Financial insecurity, moreover, forced upon him the
mundane task of earning a living. Psychical research was an
unremunerative employment, and Owen was not rich. An ill-
advised investment about 1866 cost him his entire savings and
plunged him deeply into debt. Too old to enter business, ex-
cluded from elective office by his religious beliefs, he had but
one weapon with which to fight adversity, his pen.

In his efforts to relieve financial pressure Owen turned next
to fiction. During the summer of 1868 he remained in the
West writing a portion of Beyond the Breakers, which was
published as a serial in Lippmcotfs Magazine the next year.

In this first novel the inexperienced hand was only too evident,
and the result did little to increase Owen's fame as a man of
letters. The plot was weak, the tone didactic, and an almost
sickening sentimentality pervaded its pages. Yet the tale is of
interest both because of its autobiographical touches and be-
cause the pioneer Indiana delineated by Owen was less crude
and less brutal than that drawn by Edward Eggleston two
years later. The passage of time had given a roseate hue to
Owen's early life in a frontier village, and fictitious Chicksauga
represented an idealized New Harmony. Similarly, the hero,
Franklin Sydenham, cosmopolitan intellectual, lover of Schiller
and of Norman architecture, benefactor of his little town, was
the man Owen wished he might have been or perhaps thought
that he had been. Old persons and incidents were resurrected.
Mt. Vernon became Mt. Sharon; Amos Clark, Amos Crans-
toun, the dishonest lawyer; Elisha Embree, Judge Emberly,
the Methodist politician. The Chicksauga Institute, the vil-
lage Thespian Society, and even a Congressional canvass,
reminiscent of the tumultuous election of 1839 were sketched.
Occasionally the story lapsed into a mere vehicle for the writer's
views on prison reform, spiritualism, and the property rights of
married women; but such faults were to be expected of a novice.
The most successful of Owen's literary enterprises was his
autobiography, undertaken late in 1872 at the suggestion of
William Dean Howells. The opportunity to spread his life
story in sixteen numbers of the then preeminent Atlantic
Monthly caused the Indianan to begin the task diligently and

The result was an eminently readable volume, valuable alike
for its charming story as for its source material on David
Dale, Robert Owen, and other British reformers, on the New

the vicissitudes of a proposed Fourteenth Amendment. The
author had no axe to grind. He had made his peace with God

the New Harmony experiment, Western politics, and the
Mexican War were either inaccurate or inadequate. It must
be remembered, however, that the author wrote after his
philosophy of life had undergone a profound change. It was
almost impossible for Owen the intellectual, living midst literary
friends in elite Boston, at a time when honesty in public office
had reached its nadir, to appreciate the political aspirations of
the Western Democrat of the thirties. Nor could the mild,
tolerant, Christian spiritualist do justice to the bold, militant
agnostic who had edited The Free Enquirer.
While engaged upon his autobiography, Owen did not inter-
rupt his psychical research. In fact it was the investigation
and ill-advised inclusion of the Katie King manifestations that
terminated his lucrative connection with the Atlantic and cast
a cloud over his last years. Early in June 1874, as the spiritual-
ist tide was nearing its flood, Owen arrived in Philadelphia to
witness at the request of his close friend Dr. Henry T. Child
the latest ultramundane phenomena that were setting the
Quaker City agog and which were soon to rival as topics of
conversation the Beecher-Tilton scandal and the abduction of
Charlie Ross. What the Hoosier saw at the North Ninth
Street residence of Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Holmes was truly
amazing. In a semi-darkened parlor, light enough to distinguish
forms and faces, one, two, and sometimes three figures, fully
shaped and clothed, emerged from a wooden cabinet set against
a flat wall. Apparently possessed of every human attribute,
these phantoms touched, conversed, and even joked with those
present. They were freely questioned; and their answers,
sometimes trite, sometimes consoling, sometimes revealing,
were, for some, sufficient evidence of their spiritual origin. The
most astonishing part of the whole performance was that both
mediums generally sat, unentranced, outside of the cabinet.

confederate could easily be employed. They had resorted with
increasing frequency to dark seances and had refused both
to move their cabinet or permit Owen to approach it during
the sittings as he had been accustomed to do. On several occa-
sions Katie failed to materialize; and even when she did appear,
her face was noticeably altered. On December 4 a member
of the circle, W. O. Leslie, revealed to Owen the confession
of one Mrs. White, a seamstress and former resident in the
Holmes home, who substantiated her assertion that she had
impersonated the spirit of the pirate's daughter by producing
many of the presents given Katie the previous summer. The
next evening that lady, heavily veiled, gave a mock seance

Owen received proof from England that Mr. Holmes had
forged two cheques while there; and these facts caused him
to send his disavowal to the leading spiritualist periodicals,
omitting, because of a pledge to Leslie, all details. The Indianan
did not say that all he had previously witnessed was fraudulent,

had been cast on the facts he had collected in June and July

The sequel to the Katie King affair placed neither spiritual-
ists nor their opponents in a good light. Reckless statements
and questionable tactics bordering on perjury destroyed much
of the latter's case. The former, on the other hand, after re-
vealing through the detective-like methods of Henry S. Olcott
and Francis J. Lippitt, two of Owen's friends, the worthless-
ness of Mrs, White's testimony, seemed more intent on proving
that the Holmeses possessed psychic power than on explaining

as one editor declared, believers preferred to repudiate Owen's
leadership to admitting that two professionals of doubtful
character had been guilty of fraud.

For a corollary to the

Dale Owen, by his undue haste in denouncing genuine mediums
on the evidence of interested parties had inflicted an irreparable
injury upon the movement. That Owen had been guilty of
extreme carelessness as an investigator, of rare indiscretion in
rushing his findings into print, and of inexplicable persistency
in endorsing the phenomena even after his suspicions had been
aroused cannot be denied. But in the furore that succeeded
his initial error no one, believer or sceptic, acted with greater
dignity, moderation, or more sincere desire to do justice to all
parties concerned than the venerable Hoosier.
For more than four months after December 26 Owen kept
silent on the Holmes fiasco. Then on April 15 he presented
his mature opinion in an address to American spiritualists. He
refused to accept the conclusion, fast becoming held by the
latter, that the exposure had been simply a plot of the Young
Men's Christian Association. He believed that the mediums
possessed undoubted psychic powers but that they had in the
past deceitfully supplemented them. Whether or not he had

A dissent may well be entered to the last statement. The
average man in the street probably never read the spiritualist
counter-attack against the exposure but remained satisfied
that the demoniacal religion had been crushed once and for
all. And, in truth, American spiritualism fell on evil days, the
gloom of which was heightened by the embarrassing news that
on July 10, 1875, Robert Dale Owen had been admitted to the
Indiana Hospital for the Insane.
Owen's insanity, though of short duration, is of more than
passing interest. Following close upon the heels of the Phila-
delphia fiasco, it was widely attributed to a loss of religious
faith.
28
Yet neither the cause nor the effect was what the
secular press thought. Mental and bodily exhaustion was
chiefly to blame for the Hoosier's infirmity. Until his seventy-
second year Owen's health was generally good. While in Bos-
ton writing his autobiography, he first overtaxed his strength
and in the fall of 1873 felt unable to pen some reviews for The
Atlantic Monthly. By November his condition had become
serious. A medical friend, a spiritualist himself, found the In-
dianan in a highly excitable state, suffering from an inflamed
membrane in the transverse colon. Warned that excessive
mental labor would result in softening of the brain, Owen
apparently promised to rest.

events in Philadelphia, and the nervous strain and chagrin

on July ro, 1875, Robert Dale Owen had been admitted to the
Indiana Hospital for the Insane.
Owen's insanity, though of short duration, is of more than
passing interest. Following close upon the heels of the Phila-
delphia fiasco, it was widely attributed to a loss of religious
faith.28 Yet neither the cause nor the effect was what the
secular press thought. Mental and bodily exhaustion was
chiefly to blame for the Hoosier's infirmity. Until his seventy-
second year Owen's health was generally good. While in Bos-
ton writing his autobiography, he first overtaxed his strength
and in the fall of 1873 felt unable to pen some reviews for The
Atlantic Monthly. By November his condition had become
serious. A medical friend, a spiritualist himself, found the In-
dianan in a highly excitable state, suffering from an inflamed
membrane in the transverse colon. Warned that excessive
mental labor would result in softening of the brain, Owen
apparently promised to rest.29 The next year, however, saw
five more chapters of his life story published, the dramatic
events in Philadelphia, and the nervous strain and chagrin

Quite probably it did not cause a single believer to renounce
his faith, but it certainly deterred hundreds from investigating
the subject. It drove a discussion of psychical science from the

winter of 1875-1876 he spent at St. Joseph, Marquette, and at
home, idling, visiting relatives, and fussing over business mat-
ters. Looking perfectly fit, he left in March for New York
whence he intended to sail with a few companions for a final
glimpse of the scenes of his childhood. In the East he was
showered with kindnesses, but at the last minute was forced
to forgo his European tour because of finances.
43
Then on
June 23, 1876, the telegraph wires flashed the astonishing news
that on that day at Caldwell, New York, Robert Dale Owen
had wed Lottie Walton Kellogg.
This marriage, surprising even to the bridegroom's family,
could have come only in the last third of the Indianan's life.
It is difficult to place Lottie Kellogg in the environment of Owen
the reformer or Owen the Western Democrat. But to the aging
intellectual who, after 1853, spent most of his time away from
New Harmony she made a definite appeal. Born in Hartford
about 1840 of strict Congregationalist parents, she had traveled
widely and through study abroad had become "an artist of
very fair powers and great promise."
44
Her refined tastes
and broad culture, together with certain motherly qualities
suggestive of Mary, attracted the spiritualist who, after several
solitary winters in the East, had been made more lonely by
his wife's death. The couple first met, apparently, when Owen
visited her brother-in-law at Lake George in the summer of
1872. By autumn a betrothal was rumored.45
Late the next
year Threading My Way was dedicated to this new friend.
Owen revisited Miss Kellogg's home during the next summers,
and even his illness did not seem to check the romance. And
thus it came to pass that a little known figure, who enters our
story almost at its close, did much to brighten and cheer the
Hoosier's last years.

After the ceremony Owen remained at his wife's beautiful
cottage on the eastern shore of Lake George until late autumn.
He continued to write copiously to liberal religionists, to spirit-
ualists, to feminists, and even to "My dear old Friend/' Joe
Lane, whom he had not seen for nearly two decades.
46
He
worked, too, on the last chapters of his autobiography; but they
were inferior to their predecessors and it was well for the
Atlantic that Howells' reluctance to publish anything by Owen
caused two of the six to appear instead in Scribner's Monthly?
7
He wintered in New Harmony, disposing of business details
and playing the venerable patriarch at children's parties. In
April 1877 he left again, promising to return at the earliest
opportunity to the village he had loved and honored for up-
wards of half a century. Only a few weeks before his departure
he had added two bedrooms to the drawings for his new house,
planned ever since his return from Naples.
48
But Owen had bade farewell to the Wabash for the last time.
Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane threatened to
cut his life at any moment. The first fortnight in June he
spent in Brooklyn with his close friend Dr. Eugene Crowell.
The latter saw that the case was hopeless. Seances were held
frequently, and the spirits gave unmistakable evidence that the
end was at hand. Owen faced death calmly. His religion taught
that it but ushered in a higher existence, and that faith sus-
tained him to the last. Having outlived by five years the Bibli-
cal span, he was content to go, hopeful only that he would be
spared prolonged physical pain.

cottage on the eastern shore of Lake George until late autumn.
He continued to write copiously to liberal religionists, to spirit-
ualists, to feminists, and even to "My dear old Friend," Joe
Lane, whom he had not seen for nearly two decades.46 He
worked, too, on the last chapters of his autobiography; but they
were inferior to their predecessors and it was well for the
Atlantic that Howells' reluctance to publish anything by Owen
caused two of the six to appear instead in Scribner's Monthly.47
He wintered in New Harmony, disposing of business details
and playing the venerable patriarch at children's parties. In
April 1877 he left again, promising to return at the earliest
opportunity to the village he had loved and honored for up-
wards of half a century. Only a few weeks before his departure
he had added two bedrooms to the drawings for his new house,
planned ever since his return from Naples.48
But Owen had bade farewell to the Wabash for the last time.
Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane threatened to
cut his life at any moment. The first fortnight in June he
spent in Brooklyn with his close friend Dr. Eugene Crowell.
The latter saw that the case was hopeless. Seances were held
frequently, and the spirits gave unmistakable evidence that the
end was at hand. Owen faced death calmly. His religion taught
that it but ushered in a higher existence, and that faith sus-
tained him to the last. Having outlived by five years the Bibli-
cal span, he was content to go, hopeful only that he would be
spared prolonged physical pain.49 At a sitting one warm June
afternoon the spirit of Silas Stringham, an old acquaintance

from Naples, appeared, saying, "You can't row your boat much
longer; it is time for you to go into the cabin." At first the
dying man thought this meant his sloop at Lake George; but
when the commander added, "You have sailed a good ship,
you have kept a straight course . . .
you will soon come to
anchor/' he understood. Silently he left the room, and the
circle then learned that his soul would flee ere the autumn
leaves fell.

On the fifteenth of June Owen started for his summer resi-
dence. Upon his arrival he added a last codicil to his will.
A few days later the final attack came. Although his body was
racked with pain, he manifested a "patient, sweet submission
. . . not one murmur of complaint, only a deep longing to be
released from such intense suffering, which he termed his
'forty days in the wilderness.'
"
On the evening of the twenty-
third his wife and sisters-in-law sat around his bed singing
softly his favorite tunes. These he acknowledged by a firm
pressure of the hand.51
By ten o'clock the next morning his
free enquiring spirit had learned the answer to the enigma
of the ages.
They buried him in the quiet Caldwell cemetery across the
lake from his final home. Simple private services were con-
ducted by the same Presbyterian minister who, curiously
enough, had performed the wedding ceremony a year before,
mute testimony that a once outstanding infidel had learned to
live in peace with orthodoxy. Upon his grave was carved the
brief epitaph, "Author of Footfalls on the Boundary of Another
World, and The Debatable Land between This World and
the Next. 'Love Is the Fulfilling of the Law.' "
There he
rested for sixty years until, with the consent of his aged daugh-
ter, the remains were taken to New Harmony and placed with
those of his first wife and children on Maple Hill.

LAST YEARS 415
At his death the name of Robert Dale Owen was well known
throughout the land. The obituaries in the public press were
extraordinarily full. Bryant himself, or some other close friend
on the Post, declared that the memory of the spiritualist would
be revered "because of his long and varied public service, his
rare sincerity and courage, and his uprightness of ... char-
acter." The Nation prophesied that posterity would judge him
a greater man than his father.
53
The finest eulogy, however,
was penned by an editor of his adopted state.
In scholarship, general attainments, varied achievements [said John
H. Halliday], as author, statesman, politician, and leader of a new
religious faith, he was unquestionably the most prominent man
Indiana ever owned. ... No other Hoosier was ever so widely
known, or so likely to do the state credit by being known, and no
other has ever before held so prominent a place so long with a history
so unspotted with selfishness, duplicity, or injustice.
54
Such was the verdict of 1877. Time, however, has dimmed
the luster of his fame; and today, outside of Indiana, Owen is
largely forgotten. For this unexpected eclipse Owen himself
was partly to blame. He was a religious liberal and radical
reformer before the Transcendentalists, Greeley, and Ingersoll
had made such trades respectable. He devoted his best years
to politics, the issues of which were by their very nature transi-
tory. The last third of his life was largely dedicated to the
study and propagation of an unpopular faith, and he himself
was content to be remembered for his books on that subject.
His strongest and most significant trait, an extraordinary ver-
satility, proved to be a liability; for, in general, it kept him
from that single-minded devotion to one cause which brought
honor and glory to a Weld, a Burritt, and an Anthony.
Owen deserves a better treatment than he has heretofore
received. His career is of interest and value to students of
our political, social, economic, and religious history. His life's
story is an instructive one, and his worth-while achievements

APPENDIX I
A LIST OF THE WRITINGS OF ROBERT DALE OWEN
A NOTE ON THE OWEN MANUSCRIPTS
THERE is no single collection of Robert Dale Owen's papers. Some letters
received by him are still in the hands of his family; a large number are
preserved in the manuscript collection of his friend Ferdinand J. Dreer.
Many letters written by Owen are scattered among the papers of his con-
temporaries (listed in Appendix II), and there may be collections of these
that the author has not seen. Other letters written by Owen are to be
found in the papers of Robert Owen and Richard Owen. The author has
not seen all of the manuscripts of David Dale Owen and of Richard Owen,
but he has been assured by their present owners that they contain little
or nothing that is relevant to this biography. Under these circumstances a
distinction between those family papers consulted and the manuscripts of
Owen's contemporaries is somewhat arbitrary. The former, nevertheless,
are described in more detail because they are less well known.
Owen Papers (LWI). Business letters, originals and copies, together with
some deeds, lists of property, plans for a house. Kept by Owen and
bequeathed to his eldest son. Now on loan through the courtesy of
Miss Eleanor R. Cooper.
Stone Papers (Private). A selection of the most valuable items from the
above collection. Contains some documents dealing with the purchase
of the New Harmony property. In the possession of Mrs. ^ Grace Zaring
Stone, a great-granddaughter of Owen.
Stone Letters (Private). Correspondence between Owen and his wife.
Most of the letters were written by Owen in 1832 and 1833. There
are no items between 1834 and 1855. There are a few pieces addressed
to other members of the family. In the possession of Mrs. Grace
Zaring Stone.
Robert Owen Papers (HHM). Approximately 3,000 pieces beginning
around 1823 and continuing until 1858. Probably collected for the
second volume, never written, of the elder Owen's autobiography.
There are about twenty valuable letters by Robert Dale Owen. Other
correspondents include Mary J., William, and Richard Owen, Frances
Wright, and Marie D. Fretageot.
Neal Letters (Private) . A few important letters written mostly to Richard
Owen. Some are by Robert Dale Owen; some by other members of
the family. In the possession of Mrs. Aline Owen Neal. The author
understands that these letters do not comprise the whole of Richard
Owen's manuscripts.

Florida and his view was accepted by the Portraits and Sketches of

reason to acquiesce in that conclusion. Yulee was not the type of man we
would expect to write such a pamphlet; he was not an Indianan ac-
quainted with local politics ;
he was not a "Westerner." William W. Wool-
len, editor of the Madison Banner in 1852 and a keen observer of Hoosier
politics, attributes it to Owen. Biographical and Historical Sketches of
Early Indiana (Indianapolis, 1883), 417. Other evidence in Owen's
favor is the course of the Lane boom, Owen's two verbal agreements to
undertake the work, his intimate acquaintance with Lane, and the

BIBLIOGRAPHY
To KEEP this Bibliography within reasonable bounds and to make it, at
the same time, useful for other scholars, certain arbitrary limits have
been set. Almost all secondary works, general accounts as well as mono-
graphs, have been left out on the grounds that they are probably familiar
to students of American history. Certain types of primary materials
notably handbills and broadsides, gazetteers and registers, travel accounts,
the collected writings of statesmen, and various compilations of sources
have been excluded. These omissions, partly remedied by complete cita-
tions in the footnotes, have been made in order to describe fully the
manuscripts, documents, newspapers, and periodicals consulted.

2. PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
A large number of documents, printed and unprinted, national, state,
and foreign, has been consulted in tracing Owen's public life.
A. NATIONAL
Federal documents have been drawn upon for Owen's activity in Con-
gress, for his connection with the Smithsonian Institution, for his mission
to Naples, and for his role during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
The chief printed ones include the Congressional Globe, the journals
of the Senate and the House, together with the journal of the executive
proceedings of the former, the statutes at large, and various Congressional
reports. The census shed some light on the growth of spiritualism.
Important compilations of national documents were: William M. Mal-
loy, ed., Treaties, Conventions, International Acts, Protocols and Agree-
ments between the United States of America and Other Powers, 1776-1937
(4 v., Wash., 1910-1937); William J. Rhees, ed. y
The Smithsonian In-
stitution: Documents Relative to Its Origin and History, 1835-1899 (2 v.,
Wash., 1901), and The Smithsonian Institution: Journal of the Board of
Regents etc. (Wash., 1879) ; James D. Richardson, A Compilation of the
Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897 (10 v., Wash., 1896-
1897) ;
War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies (70 v., Wash., 1880-1901).

(4 v., Wash., 1910-1937); William J. Rhees, ed., The Smithsonian In-

1897); War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the
Union and Confederate Armies (70 v., Wash., 1880-1901).
Government reports by Owen are included in the list of his writings
APPENDIX II 431
in Appendix I. An important special source is Benjamin B. Kendrick,
The Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction (Colum-
bia University, Studies, LXII, N, Y., 1914). The following reports of
the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution proved to be very
helpful.
1846: 29 Cong., 2 Sess., Reports, no. 211.
1847: 30 Cong., i Sess., Senate Misc. Reports, no. 23.
1848: 30 Cong., 2 Sess., House Misc. Reports, no. 48.
1849: 31 Cong., i Sess., Senate Misc. Reports, no. 120.

'-
33 Cong., 2 Sess., Senate Misc. Reports, no. 24.
34 Cong., i Sess., House Misc. Reports, no. 113.
The most important unprinted national documents used were the in-
structions to and despatches from the legation at Naples, 1853 to 1858,
formerly at the Department of State, now in the National Archives.
B. STATE
State documents have provided much of the material pertaining to
Owen's part in the Indiana legislature and in the convention that framed
the constitution of 1851. They have also revealed his services as a Trus-
tee of Indiana University and as the agent to purchase arms for the
Hoosier soldiers during the Civil War. Local archives disclosed some of
his business dealings.
The chief printed documents include the journals of the General As-
sembly, the journal and debates of the Constitutional Convention of
1850, the general and local laws, the revised statutes, especially those of
1852, and the documentary journals of the various legislative sessions.
Extremely valuable were the following unprinted documents : the archives
of the Adjutant, General of Indiana (ISL) ;
the official correspondence and
telegrams of Gov. 0. P. Morton, 1861-1866 (ISL); the "Deed Book,"
"Order Book," and "Will Record," in the Posey County Courthouse, Mt.
Vernon, Indiana.
c. FOREIGN
The most important collection of foreign documents bearing upon this
biography was Matias Romero, ed., Correspondencia de la Legacion Mexi-
cana en Washington durante la Intervention Extranjera, 1860-1868 (10 t,
Mexico City, 1870-1879). That compilation was indispensable for Owen's
connection with the scheme for a Congressional guarantee of a loan to
the Juarez government.
3. NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS
Newspapers, periodicals, and publications that partake of the charac-
ter of both have contributed much to this biography. They have shown
how Owen was regarded in his day by friend and by foe; they have often

listed.
A. NATIONAL
Nationally important newspapers and periodicals have depicted Owen's
career in politics and have indicated the contemporary notice taken of
the New Harmony experiment, the rise of labor, the founding of the
Smithsonian Institution, and the progress of spiritualism.

4. BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS
No attempt is made to list all the books and pamphlets consulted for
this biography. The footnotes indicate the main primary sources for the
various chapters. The purpose of this section of the Bibliography is to
evaluate briefly, by topics, the more valuable of these works, always
excluding Owen's writings detailed in Appendix I.
For the English background the Life of Robert Owen Written by Him-
self (2 v., London, 1857-1858), while not altogether accurate, was very
useful. See also George J. Holyoake's History of Co-operation in Eng-
land (2 v., London, 1875-1877) and Sixty Years of an Agitator's Life
(2 v., London, 1892).
In sketching the New Harmony community the author found Paul
Brown's Twelve Months in New Harmony (Cincinnati, 1827) more credi-
ble than have earlier writers. The most helpful contemporary accounts
and letters were: Victor C. Duclos, "Diary and Recollections" and "The
Letters of William Pelham Written in 1825 and 1826," both printed in
Indiana as Seen by Early Travelers (Harlow Lindley, ed., Indianapolis,
1916); George Flower, History of the English Settlements in Edwards
County (Chicago Historical Society's Collections, I, Chicago, 1882) ;
Joel Hiatt, ed., "The Diary of William Owen, from November 10, 1824 to
April 20, 1825," Indiana Historical Society, Publications, IV (Indianapolis,
1906), 7-134; Thomas Pears, Jr., ed., "New Harmony, an Adventure in
Happiness. The Papers of Thomas and Sarah Pears," Indiana Historical
Society, Publications, XI (Indianapolis, 1933), 7-96. The Pears and
Pelham correspondence, together with the Macdonald diary, the Maclure-
Fretageot letters, and the Owen manuscripts, constitute an indispensable
body of material that was not available when the supposedly definitive
history of the community was written by Lockwood (post).
To round out the picture of Owen the reformer that emerges from
his own writings during the New York years, the following have been
drawn upon: Abner Cunningham, An Address Submitted to the Con-
sideration of R. D. Owen, Kneeland, Houston, and Others of the Infidel
Party (N. Y., 1833) ;

4. BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS
No attempt is made to list all the books and pamphlets consulted for
this biography. The footnotes indicate the main primary sources for the
various chapters. The purpose of this section of the Bibliography is to
evaluate briefly, by topics, the more valuable of these works, always
excluding Owen's writings detailed in Appendix I.
For the English background the Life of Robert Owen Written by Him-
self (2 v., London, 1857-1858), while not altogether accurate, was very
useful. See also George J. Holyoake's History of Co-Operation in Eng-
land (2 v., London, 1875-1877) and Sixty Years of an Agitator's Life
(2 v., London, 1892).

Helpful for understanding Owen's Indiana years were: Rosamond Dale
Owen, My Perilous Life in Palestine (N. Y., 1929) and "Robert Dale
Owen and Mary Jane Robinson," History of Woman Suffrage (Elizabeth
C. Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, & Matilda J. Gage, eds., N. Y., 1881),

0. H. Smith, Early Indiana Trials and
Sketches (Cincinnati, 1858) ;
William W. Woollen, Biographical and
Historical Sketches of Early Indiana (Indianapolis, 1883) ;
and the
novels of Edward Eggleston. Useful for specific events were: Proceed-
ings at the Presentation to the Hon. Robert Dale Owen of a Silver Pitcher,
on Behalf of the Women of Indiana (New Albany, 1851); The Town of
New Harmony and the Rev. Benjamin Hoisted; Being a Report of the
Proceedings of a Meeting . . . Held . . .
isth April 1842 (Evansville,

For Owen's career in national politics manuscripts, documents, and
newspapers were the most important sources. Special mention, however,
should be made of the Memoirs of John Quincy Adams> Comprising
Portions of His Diary from 1705-1848 (C. F. Adams, ed., 12 v., Phila.,
1874-1877) ;
F. B. Carpenter, Six Months at the White House with Abra-
ham Lincoln (N. Y., 1867); and the Diary of James K. Polk during His
Presidency, 1845-1849 (M. M. Quaife, ed., 4 v., Chicago, 1910). Useful
contemporary pamphlets dealing with the Smithsonian Institution were:
David H. Arnot, Animadversions on the Proceedings of the Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution (N. Y., 1847) ; Report of the Hon. James
Meacham . . . on the Distribution of the Smithsonian Fund (Wash.,
1854) ; Report of the Special Committee of the Board of Regents . . .
on the Distribution of the Income of the Smithsonian Fund (Wash., 1854).
Indispensable for Owen's connection with the proposed Mexican loan in
1865-1866 were: Herman Sturm, The Republic of Mexico and Its
American Creditors (Indianapolis, 1869); Lew Wallace, An Autobiogra-
phy (2 v., N. Y., 1905).

SECONDARY
A large number of books and articles, familiar to historians, have been
consulted in the preparation of this biography. Most of these secondary
works, either ignoring Owen or mentioning him but briefly, were useful
only in providing the background against which Owen performed. Some
contain misleading and erroneous statements concerning his thought and
activity.
The three best sketches of Owen's life George B. Lockwood, The
New Harmony Movement (N. Y., 1905), ch. 25, Norman E. Himes in
the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (N. Y, 1933), XI, 517-518,
and Broadus Mitchell in the Dictionary of American Biography (N. Y.,
1934), XIV, 118-120 stress unduly his youthful radicalism and mini-
mize his preoccupation with politics during his middle years and with
spiritualism during his later ones. This tendency to regard Owen as a
social reformer arises also from the fact that those books which discuss
him most fully treat such matters as the New Harmony experiment and
the rise of labor in New York, matters that came early in Owen's life.

In addition to the three sketches just cited, there are a few articles of
varying merit dealing solely with Owen: Arthur H. Estabrook, "The
Family History of Robert Owen," Indiana Magazine of History, XIX,
63-101 (Mar. 1923), replete with errors; Nora C. Fretageot, "The Robert
Dale Owen Home in New Harmony," Indiana History Bulletin, I, extra
no. (June 1924), 15-26, based partly on documents, partly on tradition;
Norman E. Himes, "Robert Dale Owen, the Pioneer of American Neo-
Malthusianism," American Journal of Sociology, XXXV, 529-547 (Jan.
1930), important and stimulating but from which the present writer, on
the basis of more exhaustive research, dissents on several points; Louis

While this biography was in galley proof, there appeared The Incorrigible
Idealist: Robert Dale Owen in America by Elinor Pancoast and Anne E. Lincoln.
Within the limits set for themselves, the authors have made a worth-while con-
tribution, but with many of their interpretations the present writer cannot agree.

Naples," Indiana History Bulletin, VI, extra no. 2 (May 1929), 43-51,
adequate commentaries on certain source materials.
For some of the events and movements in which Owen played a part
there are virtually no secondary works of value. Such is the case with
American freethought after 1825, the early years of the Smithsonian
Institution, the attempt to nominate Joseph Lane for the presidency in
1852, the Mexican loan episode of 1865-1866, and, most important of
all, the history of American spiritualism. J. M. Robertson, A History of
Freethought in the Nineteenth Century (2 v., N. Y., 1930), is inadequate
for the United States; and G. Adolf Koch, Republican Religion (Ameri-
can Religion Series, VII, N. Y., 1933), does not cover the years
after 1825. The unsatisfactory character, for this study, of George B,
Goode's The Smithsonian Institution, 1846-1896: The History of the
First Half-Century (Wash., 1897), is exceeded only by that of Webster
P. True's The Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian Scientific Series, I,
N. Y., 1929). On spiritualism Frank Podmore, Modern Spiritualism.
A History and a Criticism (2 v., London, 1902), and George Lawton,
The Drama of Life after Death (American Religion Series, VI, N, Y.,
1932), are the best; but the former has nothing on American spiritualism
after 1860, while the latter is essentially an account of the contemporary
movement. For all of these matters, neglected by social historians, the
author has made special studies of his own.
For other events and movements in which Owen was concerned second-
ary works could be drawn upon. The most useful follow.
For Robert Owen and his work: G. D. H. Cole, Robert Owen (Boston,
1925); Frank Podmore, Robert Owen, a Biography (2 v., London, 1906),
For the New Harmony experiment: George B, Lockwood, The New
Harmony Movement (N. Y,, 1905), is still the fullest general account,
although the present writer differs from many of Lockwood's conclusions.
A ground-breaking work when undertaken, the book should now be sup-
plemented by the many new sources, mentioned above, made available
since Lockwood wrote. The chapters on Robert Dale Owen and education
should be used with caution. Later accounts, such as Caroline D.
Snedeker's Town of the Fearless (Garden City, 1931), have been super-
ficial, borrowing heavily from Lockwood and repeating his errors. H. B.
Weiss & G. M. Ziegler, Thomas Say, Early American Naturalist (Spring-
field, III, 1931), is an exception to that generalization, but it has little
that is new on the community experiment. There is no biography of
Maclure; but George P. Merrill, The First One Hundred Years of Ameri-
can Geology (New Haven, 1924) is helpful. Studies of Joseph Neef and
David Dale Owen are in progress.
For Frances Wright and Nashoba: A. J, G, Perkins & Theresa
Wolfson, Frances Wright, Free Enquirer (N. Y., 1939) ;
William R.

For the plank road craze: Joseph A. Durrenberger, Turnpikes. A Study
of the Toll Road Movement in the Middle Atlantic States and Maryland
(Valdosta, Ga., 1931), is more valuable than the title suggests.
For national politics, 1839-1867: The standard works and monographs
on banking, the tariff, expansion, the Mexican War, the Civil War, and
Reconstruction have been consulted; very few have much to say about
Owen.
For a more detailed account, with fuller documentation, of all phases of
Owen's career, see the author's manuscript dissertation in the Harvard
College Library.
