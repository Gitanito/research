I remember being at Lawrence
Rockefellers ranch out in the Tetons the
j.y ranch which I know that those of you
don&#39;t know the Rockefeller family gave
the whole Grand Teton National Park to
the US government but they kept out a
really beautiful ranch there at the base
of Teton Peak and he had me out there
with a group of other people back some
years ago and before he passed away and
Lawrence David Rockefeller Chase
Manhattan Bank was the one warning
disclosure David did not David was the
big banker guy petrodollar boom no he&#39;ll
know one night I was out under the stars
with Lawrence and everyone else they
sort of you know he wanted some face
time just with me and we were out under
the stars
beautiful crystal clear with one of the
original Remington statues of the Native
American on a source back looking up at
the stars like this beautiful and
Lawrence turned to me he says we really
need you to get this done I&#39;m working
full-time as an emergency doctor Kate
taking care of shootings and stabbings
and car wrecks and four children and a
golden retriever and Wow you know North
a normal life mostly at that point I use
the word normal very broadly I think
normalcy is greatly overrated
but anyway so and and I said well I need
your help he says well I can do things
behind the scenes but I&#39;m not gonna do
anything I said are you afraid for
yourself he says oh no he says but there
are members of my family already raising
hell with me that I&#39;m even doing this
much because as you know from the
project starlight documents that I
started that were the AP The Associated
Press sued the Clinton Library he was
hosting the president first lady they&#39;re
the best available evidence and all this
was being presented there were a lot of
discussions going on during the Clinton
years so he you know he said no I mean I
have family members who are really
really upset that I&#39;m doing this much so
blood is thicker than water so in that
case he didn&#39;t want to you know he
wanted to keep the peace in the family
so there are all kinds of reasons why
various people that we&#39;ve been able to
with what we have got to do we either
need to find a way that the public will
really support the funding which is so
far as I said it&#39;s about 4% of what we
need or we have to find maybe a dozen
people who can put in five or six
hundred thousand each so we need someone
to head up that because I don&#39;t know
anything about fundraising I mean I&#39;m a
doctor so that&#39;s just not my wheelhouse
or we needed to have someone bring us a
technology that&#39;s operational that can
be open source which is why we&#39;re
launching this Star Challenge and award
and I&#39;m hopeful that while we tried that
many years ago ten years later perhaps
there are people out there who really
are ready to come forward with something
open-source or if there is something
open-source on the Internet as it&#39;s
being claimed someone builds it up and
can get it to us so we can move it out
why is that important why isn&#39;t just
having it on YouTube enough how are you
gonna stand up a whole new industry this
is not just like some you know a 16 year
old can do an app and put it on the
Internet and become a cent a millionaire
great this you actually have to build
something because it&#39;s you know it&#39;s
actually tangible it&#39;s not virtual so
you how are you going to get to the poor
of the world for their villages and
homes this type of generator some has to
build them someone who&#39;s going to have
to build the thing that&#39;s gonna replace
the engine in your car someone&#39;s going
to anything gonna be General Motors
someone&#39;s gonna have to build the thing
that&#39;s gonna replace your heat pumps at
your house so those are just a generator
system that runs your house off the grid
someone is going to have and that is a
heavy industry that is going to have to
be I hate to use the word
capitalized and the cap the cap on this
it&#39;s huge it&#39;s like the Marshall Plan
that we had for Europe to rebuild Europe
this is like the Marshall Plan for the
whole planet and we&#39;re in an emergency
so we&#39;re going to once we get to this
first stage then we&#39;re going to have to
recruit stakeholders and people who
really do want to see this change was
once the genies out of the bottle I
think that&#39;ll happen you know what the
indications I got at this meeting I was
at with these 120 leaders from various
sectors from around the world was that
there&#39;s a certain number of people who
once this is out and inevitable they&#39;re
happy to be first to be second they&#39;ll
jump on so we need to create that
initial push and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
asking people to help us do
