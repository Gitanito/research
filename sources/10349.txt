Suddenly, I was walking through a grain field with vivid radiant light making the surroundings seem more alive.  In the distance, I saw two twin buildings with a majestic symmetry.  I felt someone next to me.  I asked what the buildings were, and I was told that angels just built the building and sung there.  I was walked towards the buildings.  There was a portal that joined the two buildings, and as I walked forward I requested if I could enter, but was told 'No.'  I had to go back and fight.  I passed through the portal and I woke in extreme pain in my body, and went to the hospital.
