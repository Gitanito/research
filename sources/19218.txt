I occasionally think how quickly our
differences worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat from outside
this world well the only problem with
that is that if you look at the
technologies that permit for
interplanetary interstellar travel it&#39;s
a thousand times more developed than a
hydrogen bomb which if we were to have a
massive exchange of nuclear weapons
would leave most of all life on Earth
extinguished
therefore how could we possibly have
armed conflict with another planetary
system for more than a nanosecond and
survive it they know that we couldn&#39;t
but it&#39;s a way of manipulating the
public through demagoguery of fear
jingoism false nationalism and creating
a boogeyman out of space
