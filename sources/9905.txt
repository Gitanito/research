Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    No

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Yes I'm more understanding with people and try not to be so quick to judge someone. I also am no longer short-tempered.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I first shared my experience about three years after it happened and have shared a few times to selected people who have open minds. Their reaction seemed to be they were curious of my experience. They did not seem to be influenced by my disclosure.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was probably real     It's hard to put into words but what happened was so real that there could not be any other explanation for it.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was probably real     About four years after this happened I had access to my medical records and read the doctor's entry. His statement was 'Farley's Karma allowed him to survive' which I take to mean there in no medical reason that I survived but that a higher reason allowed me to live.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
