  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in my second year of college and wasn't happy at all with my life.  I was ignored by a graduate student whom I had a crush on.  His rejection of me was the proverbial straw that made me decide that suicide was a rational choice.  I'd read Camus, 'The Myth of Sisyphus' in high school which seemed to support this decision.  
  
  I bought a bottle of pills from the local drug store and washed the pills down with alcohol. 
  
  I lay down on my bed waiting to fall asleep.  Much to my surprise my mind remained clear and I didn't feel at all sleepy.  My limbs got heavy, but that was all that I noticed.  Hours passed. I got up because I was sick to my stomach and went back to my bed and waited.  My eyes were closed.  

  All of a sudden, I found myself in a eerily strange place.  In front of me, I saw an eternity of nothingness. I immediately decided that Anything would be better than Nothing. 

I opened my eyes and found myself on my bed.  My arms and legs felt like anvils, but I managed to get off my bed and crawl to the phone in the hallway.  I called a friend and told him I'd overdosed.  He got me to the hospital where my stomach was pumped.  I was unconscious for two days.
  
  In order to stay in school, I was required to see the university's head psychiatrist every week.  I assured him that I'd never attempt suicide again but never told him why. I didn't trust him and assumed he wouldn't understand. I thought of my experience as a vision until relatively recently when I was interviewed by Bruce Greyson about myself. I recognized a second NDE in 1969, which was 'heavenly'.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I left the church by the end of high school.  I had no belief in an afterlife.  I expected my overdose to result in an endless and dreamless sleep.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain My second and positive NDE changed my relationships more than this negative one did.  

After the NDE:

I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I don't remember much that happened to me, but my NDE remains clearly etched in my consciousness.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          No.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It made me realize that my solution to life was definitely NOT suicide.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         This questionnaire seems very thorough.  I hope my input can be of help. Thanks for doing this work.
