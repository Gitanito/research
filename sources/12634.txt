It was the most peaceful place I had ever been and wanted to stay. After I was bought back, I had a strong memory of standing across the ward and I was watching the two nurses working on me. I could see what nurses were there, Ganor was straddling me and Mark was at the head of the bed trying to get an oxygen tube in.
