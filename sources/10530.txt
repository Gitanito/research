  		              		Experience Description   

  I was in first grade and  having lunch with my class in the cafeteria. Suddenly, I start to choke on my food and could not get any air. I got a little panicked. A teacher laid me over her lap and repeatedly hit my back, trying to dislodge the food.  I don't know how long this took but it felt like ages. I could not breathe and  felt my heartrate get slower. My eyes closed and I was surrounded by dark nothingness. I wasn't particularly stressed;  rather, I was quite calm and at peace. I don't remember clearly if I saw anything, but there might have been a type of purple energy standing across from me in the void. I remember thinking to myself, 'What about my mom?' I was feeling like I can't just die on her. Then I felt a realization like 'I am going to die but it's not time yet because of my mother.' I don't know how long I spent floating in the peaceful darkness. 

  I came back to my senses just as I coughed and started breathing again. I was really confused and felt as if I had just woken up from a sleep. I was happy about being able to breathe again. For some reason, I explained that I had been choking.  I remember wondering about the blissful void and also wondered why I was so calm while almost dying.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.   During this event, I was very panicked. But when I entered the dark void, I was suddenly calm and knew exactly what I had to do and why. I didn't get any extra alertness or consciousness; it was more like I calmed down and thought rationally as well as understanding why I needed to keep living.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Immediately prior to entering the void I couldn't keep my eyes open. In the void, it was like I could see clearly although everything was  black and lacked light. Yet,  I knew where I was.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.

It was just silent.

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I was in a dark void. There were no light or objects but I could clearly see the dark. I was floating. There may have been a purple energy in front of me, though I could not talk or in any way interact with it. There were feelings of peace and familiarity.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Right before the void, I was panicked. During the experience, my emotions had calmed down and I was at peace. I could think rationally. I felt a sense of being safe, but knew I should not stay there.

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   I had a realization that 'I cannot die, because of my mother'.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     I was confused by it, was I dreaming? did I die? I was pretty sure it was some sort of NDE though.
