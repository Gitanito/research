hello everyone
uh this is dr stephen greer i&#39;m joining
you from my
home out in the blue ridge mountains
outside charlottesville virginia
near the university of virginia and this
is an update sort of urgent
many of you may have seen recently that
the disclosure project
uh pro bono attorney daniel sheehan
who did the pentagon papers and ron
contra
the silkwood case and many others is now
working with louise elizondo
and so a lot of people are very confused
on what&#39;s going on since of course
everyone
on this call probably knows louise
elizondo is a professional
disinformation agent
putting out false intelligence about the
ufo matter
in through the mainstream media the
reason
danny is that mr sheehan is doing this
we&#39;ve had a long discussion about it
going back two or three weeks
is that louise elizondo approached him
to help him with his legal case because
the pentagon
was about to pull his security
clearances
and it wasn&#39;t because he was doing
things with ttsa that
they wanted him to do that it was
because he had
resigned from ttsa falling out with the
people that were the hardliners wanting
him to present that there was an alien
threat
or a threat to the national security
and he has told two people on my team
including attorney daniel sheehan that
he
knows and the other people like chris
mellon know
that there is no such thing as an alien
threat that there is not a threat to the
national security
but that&#39;s the only way they can get
this in front
of the american people to get more uh
overt
funding for the space force and
eventually
a conflict with uh these
extraterrestrial civilizations
he has flat out said he knows that
everything he&#39;s been saying
about this being a threat is untrue now
daniel sheehan has also shared and this
is even more explosive
that louise elizondo has informed him
that he
in fact has been in a facility where an
actual extraterrestrial vehicle
was stored now
why is that important because he&#39;s all
over the news 60 minutes every
mainstream news channel along with his
other cohorts in the cover-up
such as leslie keane nick pope
chris mellon and others saying that we
don&#39;t know what these are
now interestingly he absolutely knows
that some of these craft
are in fact of extraterrestrial origin
he must also then know
that some of them are ours for example
the recent jeremy corbell interview
on fox news where they were showing
these triangles
of swarming are navy ships
every one of those pyramid triangular
shaped objects with the flashing light
on them
are from either north ramen or boeing or
the lockheed
most likely north of brahman those are
man-made ufos they&#39;re anti-gravity
vehicles
everyone in the aerospace industry at
any level of clearance
knows this so the this is a big problem
so i told
mr sheehan i said look you have to be
very careful
if you&#39;re going to work with this
gentleman you have to understand that
he is a master of disinformation i am
quoting
from a senior cia official who wrote me
about this when they first emerged after
unacknowledged came out in 2017
and of course the daniel giam knows this
he told me point blank yes we know this
the main reason he&#39;s working with him is
to
represent him and to get him to come
clean so
it&#39;s a very interesting strategy what uh
daniel sheehan is trying to do is to get
louise elizondo and then perhaps
after him some of the others to actually
admit
that they know that there is not a
threat from the ufos and that they have
been
coerced into doing so recently on the
internet
uh on a youtube interview that&#39;s now
been taken down
daniel sheehan admitted that there was
an ambassador inspector general
of the pentagon had been pulled in to
look into
complaints from louise elizondo at the
insistence of daniel sheen
about him being threatened with loss of
his security clearance
because not because he was disclosing
classified material
but because he went off the leash uh and
was not wanting to continue to say
the falsehood that these were an alien
threat and i think in large part because
close encounters of the fifth kind which
exposes that as an absolute bullface lie
has now been sent seen by millions and
millions of people and it&#39;s one of the
top
trending documentaries on amazon prime
and elsewhere
so what is happening here just so people
get clear
is it it is not that daniel sheehan has
defected to the dark side or anything
like that
he&#39;s trying to encourage louise elizondo
and i think by extension some of these
others
to in fact defect from the
disinformation
and lies that they have been saying in
the mainstream media
up on capitol hill and in other places
about this subject
the two very big lies that they&#39;re
telling
as well as their acolytes people like
leslie keane who had worked with me
originally on the disclosure project by
the way
she subsequently raided our pool of
disclosure witnesses
after she got on the inside and along
with some other people
put those nuclear military site
witnesses people had been its nuclear
silos and in other places together
and spun the story that the
aliens or whatever these ufos are were
degrading our
nuclear arsenal readiness and therefore
were they
national security concern and threat
also a lie because every one of those
men told me that they felt that the ets
were trying to say please do not blow up
this beautiful planet
but if you go so far as to launch
thousands of these we can
basically disable them so she is also
someone
who has a pivoted towards getting the
money and the attention
and the mainstream coverage by basically
telling a lie
uh that a we don&#39;t know what these are
that b it&#39;s a national security concern
and c g recently she said in an
interview leslie keane said
i think it was on sunday morning cbs wow
maybe they&#39;re from russia or china well
of course she knows that&#39;s not true
she sat there with people like
uh mark mccandless with the schematics
of the main
man-made ufos with people who had
retrieved the actual e.t
craft and the bodies she knows what the
truth is about this and yet she
continues to go out into the public
and tell the same two large lies
one that these are some kind of national
security threat or concern
and number two that we do not know what
they are or where they&#39;re from
now i think anyone who would do a
cursory review of what we released in
the book unacknowledged in the
documentary unacknowledged
as well as close encounters of the fifth
kind will see that
we have proven that these are of two
types suppose the head of the
lockheed skunk works been rich wrote
in answer to a friend who who asked him
are these extraterrestrial or man-made
he said
point blank in writing signed by him on
the lockheed
skunk works stationary letterhead that
they are both they&#39;re both man-made
and extraterrestrial now this is
of course one of the most preeminent
aerospace figures of the 20th century
and this is not a contested item
it&#39;s in his penmanship and signed by him
back to a friend that we&#39;ve acquired
we have enormous amounts of information
like that
so these people that you see on 60
minutes that you see on fox news and cnn
and all the media
this is the ramping up of the false
disclosure that we warned about in 1999
when we wrote the paper when the
disclosure serves secrecy
why because they want people to now know
that there are ufos
but they want to put this big lie out
there that they are
a national security threat and concern
this is what nick pope and others keep
saying
by the way nick pope has admitted to two
people on my team
that he has been paid large sums of
money to say
these very scripted things in the
mainstream media
so that he has been able to buy some
really pricey real estate in
soho in london and elsewhere one of my
concerns about this
is that while i normally do not engage
in sort of gossip
is that now that these people are
miseducating deliberately
the american people and the world on
this it is a very big concern they have
stepped into another level of deception
um it&#39;s one thing if you&#39;re at a ufo
conference in front of a thousand people
it&#39;s another thing if there
are millions and millions of people
hearing this lie
now all these people from chris mellon
to louise elizondo to leslie kane the
nick pope and others
know for a fact just what i just said
that there are two types of ufos seen
man-made ones that is the bigger secret
by the way the et
issue is not as big a secret as the
man-made ones for a reason i&#39;ll get into
in a moment
and that this is not a national security
threat
all the images that you have seen in the
mainstream news
of the tic tac of these pyramids and
triangles
those are our hours and they were filmed
and known at some point they would
release it
to open the door to this subject but
there&#39;s more coming
you saw on the history channel where the
italian helicopter that crash landed
after it had some malfunction that whole
event
we know from paula harris who was there
and met with the man who&#39;s now the
admiral who when it is on that show
said that those were our human
classified electromagnetic weapons
that they were attempting to target ufo
et craft
that were in the area at the time she
knows this for a fact and documented it
so almost everything you&#39;re seeing
that&#39;s going out
through the mainstream media right now
is not only a lie but a damn lie
which is exactly what verner von braun
warned about
would eventually happen uh when he told
carol roslin that
in 1974 and of course which
i learned about in the early 90s and
i&#39;ve been warning people about since
unfortunately we&#39;re going to live
through this period of this false launch
of information
the only way we&#39;re going to correct it
is for all of you to share
this youtube video with everyone i don&#39;t
care if you rip it off the site and post
it elsewhere
do it because unfortunately we&#39;re at a
point now
where there is a massive information
campaign that is false and the reason
they want people to think
all of these are things that we don&#39;t
know and can&#39;t figure out how they fly
is so that eventually they can put out
more
scary information perhaps next month
with the director of national
intelligence
report showing even more gruesome events
that have happened
that show in fact that these are a
threat to the national security
why of course that with the fascist
military-industrial and industrialist
complex want people to be afraid of
something
so this is the next big thing it&#39;s much
bigger than 9 11. it&#39;s much bigger than
covid
we&#39;ve been warning about it for some
time unfortunately
we&#39;re trying to see if some people can
get pulled off
the precipice including louise elizondo
that is why daniel sheen is working
with him now i&#39;ve made it very clear
that daniel sheehan has told me he would
do this that if he cannot get
louise elizondo to speak the truth and
come clean on this
that he would drop him as a client he
will drop him as a client
we need we will hold him to this this is
something he must do
but in the meanwhile we should give him
some time to see if he can repair the
situation
by being an attorney representing the
sort of the tip of the spear of
disinformation going out to the media
which is of course louise elizondo who
was sent on this mission
my understanding is you know people are
complex i think both chris mellon and
louise elizonda reset re
you know regret what they&#39;ve done um we
also know that there are other people
who are beginning to come forward with
information
um which sounds unbelievable such as
jacques valet
uh disclosing that in the 1980s he saw a
document describing
c i a run alien hoaxed abductions
in brazil and argentina we are going to
be releasing this soon
of this information there are a number
of things that need to come out and i&#39;m
making
an appeal right now anyone who has
has information or has been on a
tactical team
engaging in these false flag operations
from the 1950s
until now need to come forward and
expose this
as a hoax the reason for that is that if
we don&#39;t expose
the trickery and the hopes the thing
that the american public
and the world are going to be left with
is this terrifying
perspective of there being a threat from
outer space
which will justify not only the
expansion of weapons in the space
but also the space force and this alien
threat
narrative that they&#39;ve been working on
for 70 years
remember wesley clark four-star general
uh wesley clark as well as verner von
braun
and carol rosin have stated that they
have seen
documents that were very top secret that
were listing all the nations that we
would get into wars with
and that the big crescendo the final
card to be played as verner von braun
stated
would be the alien threat card we are
there now in 2021
may of this year um by next month
who knows where this will have gone we
need to move very forward aggressively
to get the truth out
so we are working so that in the next
month the cosmic hoax this next
documentary that
all of you have helped fun and i&#39;m
thanking you very much for that
we are already now in post-production on
that
and i&#39;ve seen a rough cut the first 45
minutes it&#39;s amazing
it&#39;s going to blow people&#39;s minds it&#39;s
going to be case closed
that film is not going to be proprietary
every single one of you need to find
influencers celebrities
networks of people to take that film and
post it on every site on the planet
the instant i mean the day it&#39;s released
we are moving very fast with this now
the campaign for
the fundraising of that we reached our
goal but if we receive
more contributions we&#39;ll be able to do
more of a marketing campaign in a public
awareness campaign
because there&#39;s nobody funding that we
don&#39;t have the history channel or
netflix or some big distributor
and putting one indian head nickel into
getting the word out that&#39;s all up to us
so anyone who can help us with that we
are very much appreciative of your
contribution whether it&#39;s one dollar or
fifty thousand dollars
the other point i want to make is that
this report coming out from the director
of national intelligence
uh i have variably heard that it&#39;ll be
out june 1st
that has been repeated to me that&#39;s
early it&#39;s due
by june 25th but i&#39;ve heard other
rumblings
uh from senator marco rubio and others
that it may be delayed because the
director of national intelligence has
been stonewalled
by some of the three letter agencies in
getting
to the bottom of it and providing a
comprehensive report
so it&#39;s a big question mark whether
we&#39;re going to be dealing with that
report
which most likely will be half-truths
disinformation
spin falsehoods and confusion
uh on june 1st or later in the summer
we need to be standing by and ready to
move into action very quickly
because look the entire mainstream media
the intelligence community and the
military industrial complex is a raid
against
the truth full stop end of discussion
and so we the people are going to have
to stand up and say oh wait a minute
uh this is not the truth here&#39;s what the
actual truth is
we know that many of these are man-made
we know they have been done
used in false flag operations and we
also know that some are extraterrestrial
but they are not hostile
so i think that this is really what i
said in 1992-93
would become a sort of a struggle for
the minds and hearts of humanity
the future of our planet and the future
of our place in the cosmos
and it&#39;s a choice we&#39;re at a fork in the
road as a civilization
we&#39;re either going to choose to go
forward in peace
on this planet and in space or we will
be facing
quite literally an extinction level
event if we stay on this path
of violent engagement and the expansion
of the war machine in the space
and the placement of weapons in space
etc
as it is there are already very
destructive weapons
on satellites and on the ground and on
aircraft
that target extraterrestrial vehicles
when they come into 3-d
out of trans-dimensional space-time and
we also have events happening where
these very advanced aircraft
made by the lockheed skunk works and
other places
are in fact being used in false flag
operations
many of you have asked me when will the
false flag event happen
you don&#39;t get it it already has it&#39;s
been happening since the 50s
so many of the ufo events that have been
portrayed as alien or not
abductions mutilations some of the crash
landings like the cash landrum case
where those people were injured with
radioactive wastes being spewed on them
those were all man-made accidents but
they were portrayed as
unknown ufo incidents and the unknown
translates into public awareness
immediately to
alien so i think we have to be very
clear
uh that this is a disinformation
campaign
that has gone from let&#39;s say the fringes
of alternative media and the ufo
subculture
now straight into the mainstream media
and coming straight out of the u.s
government at the level of the director
of national intelligence and the
congress
now one thing i know is true is that
whatever is in this report even if you
had the most sincere
person at the top at the director of
national intelligence level
you must not assume that he has been
given access
to the unacknowledged special access
projects
why do i say that as the person
the only person in the ufo world that
can say he has done this
as i am the person who has briefed a
sitting ci director
a sitting head of the defense
intelligence agency the head of
intelligence
for the joint chiefs of staff admiral
tom wilson
is the meeting for which has been
confirmed through the
dr davis leak uh that came out from the
edgar mitchell archive
we have to understand uh that
in each of those cases those men were
not
allowed to be briefed on these
unacknowledged special access projects
nor have most of the presidents and nor
have most
senators what does this mean it means
that whatever the director of national
intelligence may have access to
will have been pulled out of this black
world
and put on a platter and cherry-picked
much like dick cheney and his minions
cherry picked the intelligence that got
us into the devil
known as the iraq war so and by the way
uh secretary of state and former
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
of colin powell his chief of staff
admitted
on camera that they were deceived with
hoaxed and false
information from the intelligence
operation
out of the west wing run by dick cheney
after 9 11
that got us into that disastrous war and
we&#39;re still
in that debacle so one of the things you
have to understand is that
someone like the director of national
intelligence those people come and go
every few years
we cannot assume and should not assume
that he has been read into or briefed
into these unacknowledged special access
projects
where he would be able to discern what
is true
what is false what is fact what is
fiction
now that&#39;s even more true for the
president of the united states
who has a lot of things on his plate or
a member of the senate intelligence
committee
so none of these people are specialists
in this area
they&#39;re extremely vulnerable to the
people who are the foxes guarding the
hidden house
and therefore we can&#39;t describe
uh a terrible motive necessarily
to whoever creates this report because
they simply may be reporting
as required by law in the this bill that
was passed in december
but they have been spoon fed because
the big mistake everyone makes is they
think
wow you&#39;re the director of national
intelligence you&#39;re the president you&#39;re
the
head of the defense intelligence agency
or the cia
there&#39;s this assumption that you have an
all-access pass
that is absolutely not true and i can
prove in a court of law that it&#39;s not
true
so for that reason we have to be uh
careful in how we evaluate this and i
think that
uh it now this is different from people
like luis elizondo
who has now admitted to the disclosure
project lawyer daniel sheehan
that he was not telling the public the
truth that there was a threat from the
aliens or the ufos uh now if he were to
say there&#39;s a threat to the national
security
from the unacknowledged special access
projects that have
these very advanced technologies that
would be true
that&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying so he needs
to correct his statement
or we will continue to expose this line
that&#39;s the same thing for leslie keane
same thing for jeremy corbell same thing
for nick pope
same thing for chris mellon so they
either need to get off the stage
and not make false statements know what
they&#39;re talking about
and certainly they need to stop
repeating these lies
to the american public and to the
congress
because this is a very dangerous path
that they&#39;re on
whether they&#39;re on it wittingly or
unwittingly i can&#39;t say what their
motives are
but we now know for a fact that louise
elizondo knows
better than to say that a we don&#39;t know
what these are
b that we don&#39;t have anything that can
move the way these
are moving and see that he doesn&#39;t know
if they&#39;re extraterrestrial or not since
we now know
he has admitted that he has been in a
facility with an
actual extraterrestrial craft that was
retrieved
now these sort of uh omissions of the
truth
and half-truths are very very dangerous
because people think because of his uh
credentials and the same is true of
chris mellon
as someone who is an official who&#39;s been
in the pentagon
and the department of defense people
take them
to know what they&#39;re talking about so if
they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking
about
they need to learn what the subject is
really about
and until then be quiet if they are
going to
continue to tell lies knowingly the way
that both chris mellon and luis elizondo
have done
and we can expect more people in their
wake to come out telling these sort of
lies
we need to call them out on it and we
need to do it very clearly
because there&#39;s too much at stake people
are actually believing what they&#39;re
saying
they think that they&#39;re doing this
sincerely and we now know for a fact
that it is a big deception and it is a
dangerous deception because
in the process of this deceptive uh
misinformation disinformation campaign
it is opening the door to uh this
this alien threat narrative but also
hiding the fact that the
technologies that have been reverse
engineered from studying
extraterrestrial vehicles that have been
operational since the 50s
would uh could then be used
in a false flag operation
in the future and everyone is going to
be convinced oh well we&#39;ve had these
officials tell us we don&#39;t have anything
like this
this is why they&#39;re feeding these
talking points to people like senator
marco rubio and others
who do not know what the truth is about
this but the talking points have within
them
this very central lie it is
very important that you understand that
the reason they keep saying
we don&#39;t have anything that can move
like that tic tac or move like those
pyramid or triangular object
over the destroyer the reason they&#39;re
saying that
even though it&#39;s it&#39;s an absolute
provable lie is because it preserves the
element of surprise it preserves the
element of surprise
of a false flag operation where those
same
technologies that are man-made and
controlled by covert programs
can be used in some kind of scary
scenario
you can imagine what those might be and
make it look like it&#39;s the aliens did it
blaming on the aliens
so this has been going on already as i
said for over uh 60 years since the 50s
now will they step up that game
that&#39;s up to us i think if we can expose
this central lie we can prevent this
disaster
and but that&#39;s not going to be done by
cnn and cbs news in 60 minutes
it&#39;s going to be done by us and you guys
all of us together have to join hands
and you know expose what the truth is
expose what the lies are
and then through the ce5 initiative
continue to make
peaceful contact with these
civilizations because
ultimately if enough people do that
and have that knowledge and experience
then
the media and the intelligence community
will simply not be able to convince the
public
but that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that we
step up that initiative
ce5 contact is so important to resolving
this problem in a positive way
in the meanwhile we&#39;re putting out this
particular forest fire
of disinformation that&#39;s been set by the
likes of louise elizondo
and leslie keane and others now one of
the problems is
we don&#39;t have the control over the
mainstream media as you&#39;ve seen and
unacknowledged
uh you know daniel sheehan testified
that he saw a document during watergate
uh the pentagon papers when he was
representing the new york times
way back then you were talking almost 50
years ago now that there were 42 people
on the payroll the cia who were senior
editors and national security editors
and the like on the world&#39;s media
now we know that richard doty who is a
master of disinformation himself
admitted that he carried quote bags of
cash
to the media we have many people who
have been
covertly uh and privately admitted that
they&#39;ve been involved in those
sort of media corruption schemes so
we cannot count on the fourth estate the
free press
to expose the truth because frankly they
are not free
and they are fed this information
through
clandestine contacts in their editorial
boards
and their national security desk and
that is how
the system is gained so that means we
have to go
alternative we have to go through the
internet we have to go through
influencers we have to do it through
grassroots
and that&#39;s why this documentary coming
out the cosmic hoax
which i hope will be out within the
month next month about
the next 30 days or less that
whole documentary needs to be seen by
one to two billion people
over the summer i think it&#39;s the only
way we&#39;re going to get the alternative
actual true disclosure out as opposed to
the
false disclosure which of course we
warned about
for now almost 25 years
now the way we can do that is all of us
figuring out
who do we know who do we know who knows
someone who knows someone
that may be an influencer may have a
large platform
uh who we can share the film with and
say here
download this and put this on your
youtube channel or
some blockchain site or whatever it is
because we&#39;re going to distribute it
through the people and you guys are the
people so again i&#39;d like to thank you
guys for doing that begin to think of
how you&#39;re going to do this with us and
how we can work together
if you are a contact to a major
uh influencer that has millions of
followers who can post this for us
please do i&#39;ve recently heard from
an artist named chris brown who wants to
help us get this information out of
course demi lovato is
chris daltry william shatner is also
wanting to help us get this
information out he&#39;s the captain kirk if
you remember from star trek
so we&#39;re creating a network to do this
uh in a viral grassroots way but we also
can rely on people just doing it person
to person to person
uh and everyone has a list of a few
hundred people they may have been on
their social media pages
uh some may have thousands some may have
millions
uh it doesn&#39;t matter because if millions
of people share it with
a a few hundred people we&#39;ve reached
hundreds of millions of people
so everyone needs to see that this is
kind of how you can
join in this effort uh the main purpose
of this
kind of urgent call was to clarify what
daniel sheehan is doing why he&#39;s doing
it and what the
aspiration is the aspiration is luis
elizondo will
defect from the path of disinformation
and distortion
and actually begin to speak the truth
and if he doesn&#39;t
i&#39;ve been assured by daniel sheehan that
he would drop him
as a client so this is what we will be
watching for
and uh we don&#39;t know how this is going
to turn out this is really up to
what mr elizondo wants to do but we&#39;re
going to be watching and we&#39;re going to
ask all of you to be watching
with us so thank you very much and stay
tuned and if you want to help us go to
ce5
film dot and you can contribute some to
that so we can
create a huge campaign to get this
documentary out in a month or so
again thanks for your help bye-bye
