    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Essence of Common Sense, The.
 A Journal of New Thought.
 1906  Monthly
 Colorado Springs, CO.  Publisher: Common Sense Publishing Company.  Editor: J.L. Schaffer.
 1/1, August 1906-(?)  20 pp., 5 1/3 x 6.

 The journal's policy, announced in its first issue, was "to keep within the limits of common sense in every department"-a claim perhaps cast in doubt by its emphasis on astrology and by an article by Alexander J. McIvor-Tyndall on "Prophecy and Prediction."  The journal advocated a pure strain of New Thought: "If we are true to Nature and her principles, there can and will be no limit to our Health," and published a series of Common Sense Rules to enable the reader to be true to Nature: "To eat pure food in moderation; to be clean in living; to drink pure water in abundance, with regular bathing; and to have confidence, without fear, anger, malice, revenge, dishonesty, jealousy or strife, will bring about Health, Happiness and Prosperity."  Poems by Grace M. Brown.  As a premium, the journal offered its reprint of The Higher Socialism, book and a year's subscription for $1.00.  Denver Public Library.
