  		              		Experience Description   

    I was suffering with a chronic cluster headache. In the days leading to my experience, I the headache was especially painful. It was  so bad that even my acute help medication was only of limited  help for the pain. So, I additionally consumed cannabis for the pain.  A suicide due to overdose of pharmaceuticals can't be excluded as the cause of the NDE, as in the days prior I had already unconsciously overdosed with sleeping pills.
  
  The pain continued to be so bad that I had  tachycardia and an epileptic seizure. Most probably I was still  breathing during cardiac arrest I was more or less alone at home, and there was nobody watching me.
  
  After I felt ventricular fibrillation,  and the cardiac arrest happened, everything simply got dark around me.   I left my body. I could see myself lying on my bed. I  experienced again everything again, but  from another perspective. It was as if somebody was showing me a picture of it.
  
  Then, I saw a light and  went towards it. I felt the presence of other people or souls and my deceased relatives, who were escorting me. I entered the light and then there was nothing anymore. Everything was white and flooded with light. I went in front of my creator and was judged. My whole life was shown to me; what I should hold onto in a new life even though I only saw the good sides.
  
  I was shown the Universe. I was shown the  past, present, and future.  I was shown that my existence was not yet over because I had not yet fulfilled my assignment. Knowledge about myself and my disease was conveyed. The sense of my life was explained to me. I was put in front of a decision; to start a new life or to continue the old one with new knowledge. I decided for the life with the cluster headache.
  
  Then I went back into my body, with knowledge and purpose born anew and  destined to great deeds. My heart started beating and I woke up.
