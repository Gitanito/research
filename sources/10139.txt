I lost control and went into the ditch. Everything went black and then I could see myself slumped over the floor console in the car from inside the roof of the car. All I could think of is who is that? Things went black again and then I could feel and see I was floating through a field and all I could think of is I had to see my sister and say goodbye. Things went black again and then I saw the tunnel and the light. It was a warm feeling, hard to describe. I heard many voices of men, but the loudest was a woman saying 'It's not your time, go back.' I felt disappointment by that. Then things went black again and that's when I came to in the car.
