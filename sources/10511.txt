  				  MY GRAND MOTHERS COUNTRY HOME HAS A BRIDGE IN THE FRONT THE ROAD IS ON ONE SIDE AND THE HOUSE THE OTHER. A BRIDGE SPANS A WIDE CREEK. I WAS PLAYING IN THE CREEK. I GOT INTO A SANDY AREA AND I SLID INTO A DEEP HOLE IN THE CREEK BOTTOM. I WAS UNDER WATER. MY FATHER SAW WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE FRONT PORCH. HE JUMPED IN AND TRIED TO REVIVE ME.


I REMEMBER GOING INTO WATER OVER MY HEAD AND SEEING THE AIR BUBBLES GO TO THE SURFACE. THINGS WENT BLACK FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS. THEN THE SCENE CHANGES. MY FAMILY WAS STANDING AROUND MY BODY, MY FATHER GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH. I WAS ABOVE THEM FLOATING. MY VISION WAS EXPANSIVE. LIKE A CINEMA-SCOPE MOVIE. I ESPECIALLY REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER NAVY POLKA DOT DRESS. THEY COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR ME THOUGH. I WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING ON, WHAT HAPPENED. THEN I REMEMBER THROWING UP AND I WAS BACK IN MY BODY.


I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME WHAT HAPPENED. BUT LATER IN LIFE, THIS NDE HAUNTED ME. I TRIED TO GET INFORMATION AND BEGAN READING ABOUT EDGAR CAYCE, PSYCHICS, NDE, ETC. I STARTED READING IN THE 1965 AND STOPPED IN THE 1970'S. THEN PICKED UP AGAIN IN THE LATE 1980'S. I HAVE READ SO MUCH ABOUT LIFE, DEATH, THE AFTERLIFE, AND RELIGIONS I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FOR SURE.
