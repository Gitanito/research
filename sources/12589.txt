I stopped to plug in our web cam for security.  Then I was walking down a dirt path toward a bright light. There were very tall green trees lining the path.  It felt so warm and there was such a good feeling all around me. I could hear birds in the trees singing.  Then I could hear my wife behind me yelling my name over and over.  She sounded so far away. Finally, something told me to go back.  I turned as in fast motion and I shot to her face. She was yelling for me to come back and pounding on my chest. I woke up 6 hours later in the emergency room wondering where I was.
