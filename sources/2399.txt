years. In the almost multitudinous novels with their varied
themes, all dealing with the dark side of sex, virtually every
phase of debased sex thought and practice was dealt with.
As was only natural, the millions of men and women who
constantly read this debasing literature were inoculated with
an inner defilement which gradually, imperceptibly and almost
unconsciously, took place.
Today many of these millions are almost unable to look
squarely into the eyes of even those they love, or believe they
love, because of the contaminated thoughts and inner desires
governing them.
During all of the past centuries there has been only one
publication which could compare in its evil, debasing, degrad-
ing sex teachings, to these novels taken as a whole.
This was he KAMA SOUTRA Regies de L'Amour de Vat-
syayana, a work translated into French, but considered so evil in
its inculcations and influence that its importation, even though
published in French, was forbidden.
This work, giving instructions in all the vile practices known
to man, did not actually have as evil an influence on humanity
as our modern sex novels. This is explained in the fact that
basically, it was a religious work and a strong psychological
factor was present.
This factor was missing in our modern novels, the base side
being paramount; the evil, sensual side was dramatized as the
only important subject under consideration.
This lowering of the moral thought, sense and desire of the
vast number of peoples as a direct result of these debased pub-
lications gave rise to another evil, which, if possible, has had,
and continues to have, an almost greater influence for debase-
ment than the "sexy" novels.

"So far as we can tell, neither the strength of the Greek race
nor the standards of its culture suffered. Rather, they estab-
lished a golden age which successive generations have tried
to emulate—but not in their frank approach to sex."
We suggest that our readers study these several paragraphs
carefully and in doing so, ask themselves the questions: Where
is Sappho and her cult? Where is this mighty Greek nation
and her standards of culture? Is this author suggesting that we
follow the practices of the Greeks? Lastly, if it is true that
neither the Greek race nor their standard of culture suffered,
then why should the honest American worker and business man
now be so heavily burdened by millions in taxes to defend, pro-
tect and feed this "strong and cultured nation" of a "golden
age" from annihilation?
Tolstoi is remembered above all else for his command to the
people: "Bethink yourself!" It were indeed well if the American
people began in real earnest and sincerity to do so.
These surveys and the commentaries have successfully ac-
complished one thing: something which the verboten he Kama
Soutra never succeeded in doing for the peoples of India, or even
for the French people; a damage beyond repair; an evil that
will continue as long as these texts are read.

the resulting suspicions implanted in the minds of all who
are so unfortunate as to read them.
Worst of all is the fact that no actual knowledge whatever
has been gained by these surveys. Mature mankind was well
informed that these evils exist to some degree, but believed them
limited to certain degenerate types. By these misleading sur-
veys they are now led to believe, or at least to suspect, that al-
most all human beings, beloved father, mother, brother, sister,
sweetheart, husband and wife, may be secretly guilty of one or
more of these unsavory practices or vices.
Moreover, all of the approaches are from the lower, animal-
istic, carnal plane, lacking all suggestion that there may be a
higher, greater, spiritual concept, and a means for turning car-
nal thoughts, ideas and practices into avenues of idealism, exalta-
tion and final spiritualization; or, as the Bible has it, the means
of helping "mortality put on Immortality."
The approach is altogether wrong. It is an approach from
the basest instinct in man; its concept is the gutter of human
society. Men who have the welfare of the race at heart, who
believe that a Regeneration of the race is possible and practical;
men of the "cloth" of all churches, must gather together and
give battle to this evil from the opposite direction.
It must be a spiritual approach; not one of smugness and self-
righteousness, but an activity that is sane, practical, and, above
all, HUMAN. It must be something that the common man who
is honest, sincere, more or less moral, can understand and be
able to accept; both the reason and the modus operandi.

all the evils of sex; the subterfuges employed to enjoy the crea-
tive act without assuming any responsibility. He believes that
sex is dual in its nature; reproductive on the one hand, REgen-
erative on the other; that it is human in reproduction; divine in
its possibility as an agent for REgeneration.
Life moves swiftly and not always constructively. Frequently
the efforts made to correct an evil, are more degrading and
destructive than the evil itself. This is most certainly true rela-
tive to affairs of sex.
After this text had been fully set into type, but before it
could be printed, the thinking world horrified by the news
emanating from Japan that that country had \egalized Birth
Control.
It is admittedly true that Japan is desperately in need of
reducing its birth rate for the reason that the country is far
from able to supply the necessary food to its people; but the
method pursued should be in harmony with the Laws of both
Nature and of God — if it is possible to separate them.
If Japan legalized Birth Control clinics where the people
would be instructed in natural methods for the limitation of
childbirth it would be the proper thing, but the statesmen (?)
of Japan acted radically and legalized the establishment of what
will be neither more nor less than "Abortion rings," a crime
greater than the methods pursued in Greek when it was found
that the country could no longer adequately support its people.
The worst feature will be in the certainty that the lower,
irresponsible class, with few exceptions, will not take advantage
of the opportunities offered but will continue to breed as they
always have, while the better class, the responsible class will,

14 FOREWORD
all the evils of sex; the subterfuges employed to enjoy the crea-
tive act without assuming any responsibility. He believes that
sex is dual in its nature; reproductive on the one hand, REgen-
erative on the other; that it is human in reproduction; divine in
its possibility as an agent for REgeneration.
Life moves swiftly and not always constructively. Frequently
the efforts made to correct an evil, are more degrading and
destructive than the evil itself. This is most certainly true rela-
tive to affairs of sex.
After this text had been fully set into type, but before it
could be printed, the thinking world horrified by the news
emanating from Japan that that country had \egalized Birth
Control.
It is admittedly true that Japan is desperately in need of
reducing its birth rate for the reason that the country is far
from able to supply the necessary food to its people; but the
method pursued should be in harmony with the Laws of both
Nature and of God - if it is possible to separate them.
If Japan legalized Birth Control clinics where the people
would be instructed in natural methods for the limitation of
childbirth it would be the proper thing, but the statesmen (?)
of Japan acted radically and legalized the establishment of what
will be neither more nor less than "Abortion rings," a crime
greater than the methods pursued in Greek when it was found
that the country could no longer adequately support its people.
The worst feature will be in the certainty that the lower,
irresponsible class, with few exceptions, will not take advantage
of the opportunities offered but will continue to breed as they
always have, while the better class, the responsible class will,

with the result that very shortly the "breeders," not the leaders,
will be in control. It was so in Greece, it will be so in Japan.
With these thoughts in mind the work goes forth on its mis-
sion with the ardent prayer that it will be the means of destroy-
ing the suspicion that all men and women are guilty of sex evils.
We also desire to awaken all who have the welfare of mankind
at heart, to actively engage in teaching the truth, and nothing
but the truth; the natural—and at the same time, the spiritual
means—of meeting a difficult problem.

PROLOGUE
To deny sex or to hide it is to suppress it. This must always
result in some form of DEgeneration of either mind, body and
Soul, the spiritual part of man, or all three of them. To
more or less deify sex is to iMmortalize it. As a suppression of
sex brings about some form of DEgeneration, we must consider
sex and deal with sex as we must with the whole man.
We must recognize its proper function; its necessity to the
continuation of the race as well as its application in the spiritual-
ization of the whole man. In other words, we must neither deny
nor deify sex, but must take the middle course, complet-
ing the Trinity, and give sex its rightful, proper, sane place in
life.
It is unreasonable to assume that man can think of God, love
God, become conscious of God and at the same time ignore or
suppress sex—the means of creation. It is equally unreasonable
to consider sex as being all of life; giving it precedence in one's
thoughts, desires and efforts. The one is as irrational and as ab-
normal as the other. Both lead to weakness and worse.
The middle course is the only rational, sane course to pursue.
God did not give sex to man to ignore or to merely "multiplen-
ish the race." Neither did he give man other things for one
purpose only. Duality governs in all activity and the fullness
of life is to bring this duality into a trinity of action.
The proof that sex and God are linked together, sacrilegious
as this may at first thought appear, is found in the fact that the
man or woman who has so abused sex as to have destroyed its
very existence, is no longer capable of loving either the opposite
sex or God. On the contrary, whoever is possessed of an abun-
dance of sex ability or capacity, well controlled, is not only
capable of the greatest love, but also possessed of the greatest
ability to accomplish mighty works.

One of the evils, and there are many, is related neither to
the sex nor the consciousness of its possession, but in deifying
it; that is, in placing it upon a throne above all other things.
"Thou shalt have no other Gods before me" is the command;
this "no other" refers to all things man may desire, possess,
make use of or abuse; not referring to sex alone.
It is almost as easy for a man to make "a god" of woman,
of gold, or power, or of position, as it is of sex. Why, then,
take the position that the evils growing out of sex are so
much greater than the evils attributed to other things? All
things that man can use or abuse are under the one Law.
For the married to engage in the marital embrace under
the delusion that it is a sin, with a feeling of shame while under
the compulsion of normal desire, is A degradation not
ALONE TO THOSE SO ENGAGED, BUT IS ALSO SACRILEGIOUS
to GOD, as much as if man engaged in prayer with a sense of
shame. Both are holy and sanctified if the intent and the pro-
cedure are correct.
Just so long as man is led to believe and made conscious
that the creative act is sinful and something to be ashamed
of, just so long will he be unable to form a true concept of
the God who created man with sex desire.

earth, wherein to house the Soul which should sooner or later
become Immortalized.
Here we have an example above all others that the Infinite
must make use of the finite for its manifestation: an Immor-
talizable Soul imbedded in a body of clay. However, when
man attempts to find selfish or complete satisfaction in the
material and physical by means of carnal practices, then he
is entirely on the wrong path.
The satisfaction of the physical and material may be based
on what, under general conditions, would be carnal, but with
a spiritual desire. Then the spiritual takes the place of the
material, provided the procedure is correct.
Does man not use material mind and heart during his
prayers to God? And though his prayers proceed from man's
material self, are they not acceptable to God? Is the creative
organism less holy in the sight of God than mind and heart?
If not, where then is the evil in the use of one and not the
Other, IF THE DESIRE, i.e., THE INCENTIVE IS IN LOVE AND
devotion? God is not a respector of persons, hence He can-
not possibly be a respector of the parts of a person, and remain
GOD.
Two glaring misconceptions have enthralled the minds of
men, lo, these many centuries. First: That man is possessed
of an Immortal Soul; Second: That man seeks Infinite Love
through the medium of finite beings.
These two illogical conclusions proceed hand in hand;
neither one has a basis of fact. Man does possess a Soul; or,
more correctly, the nucleus or Spark of a Soul; but, unless
the Nazarene was very much in error, that soul IS NOT
IMMORTAL UNTIL MAN HAS MADE IT SO BY MEANS OF
REGENERATION, i.e., THE SECOND BIRTH.

Secondly, the wise man does not seek Infinite Love by
means of, or through the help of finite beings; what he does
do if he is a normal man, is to express his Love for both GOD
AND THE SECOND HALF OF HIS BEING, HIS MATE, BY MEANS
of a finite ACT. The Love and worship of His God is one
thing; the love for his mate is another side of his being.
The two in conjunction complete both his being and his
worship; one does not interfere with the other, they comple-
ment each other; moreover, and what is of the utmost impor-
tance, is the indisputable fact that, unless God fostered a fraud
upon his children, when man engages woman in love,
HENCE IN WORSHIP, HE THEREBY NOT ONLY COMPLETES
A SACRED RITE BY MEANS OF MUTUAL EXCHANGE, BUT HE
LIKEWISE WORSHIPS GOD AND, IF THE ACT IS AS IT SHOULD
BE, IT IS A MEANS OF REGENERATION; THE LIFTING UP OF
THE SERPENT, HENCE OF THE TWAIN, TOWARD GOD.
If man engages in the act for purely self-satisfaction in
order to relieve his lusts, then God and all His goodness will
be left out of it, but if he follows the Divine Law, then Love
is at the foundation of the act; love glorified, and since
GOD IS LOVE, AN ACT OF LOVE CAN NEITHER DEBASE MAN
NOR LEAVE GOD OUT OF IT.
The creative act, as some ignorantly maintain, is never
followed by weakness, by a feeling of degradation, an aversion
toward one's partner or a repugnance, but by a feeling of
EXALTATION, OF UPLIFTMENT AND OF GREATER LOVE.
Only when self and lust prompt the act do these undesirable
feelings follow in its wake.
The normal act of love—not mere satisfaction of a bio-
logical urge, though this is the unconscious part of it—does
not ever permit man a feeling of escape from his responsibilities

to mankind and God, but instead, IT ADDS A FEELING OF
GREATER RESPONSIBILITY DUE TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
HAVING ACCEPTED THE "FAVOR" HE IS NOW BOUND TO
PROTECT THE PARTICIPANT IN THE RITE, FOLLOW WHAT
MAY.
The creative act, properly and holily engaged in, lifts man
from the lowly creature, first to manhood, and finally to
Godhood. He awakens his consciousness to a fixed certainty
that he is not merely a creature of God, but a co-creator with
God, and that if he desires to maintain the newly born MAN-
HOOD, he must not commit any mean or degrading act.
Guilt never follows in the wake of the marital rite if Love
is the base; if consent is won; if the act is normal, natural
and complete; the mutual exchange completed and the thoughts
turned toward Love and God.
Love is not license; not even liberty; love is an act
WITHIN THE LAW and NEVER AN EVASION OR INFRACTION
OF the LAW. Immorality is first a liberty taken, then a license,
and is followed by anarchy.
This is not possible where man is conscious of a proper
concept of God and His Divine Law. It is so only when men
have lost all faith in the existence of God due to a false and
misleading interpretation of His Laws.
Once the truth of the possibility of Immortality is fully
recognized, not as a free gift from God, but as something
man MUST EARN for himself by the ELEVATION OF HIS
THOUGHTS AND DESIRES, AND THE PURITY OF HIS ACTS,
MAN WILL NO LONGER DEGRADE ANYTHING, BUT WILL

WHO POSSESSES HIS AFFECTION AND HIS LOVE, AS GOD
POSSESSES IT IN THE HEAVENS.
His acts begin in the finite, the temporal, and have their
reaction in the infinite and eternal. His Self-Love is
changed into love for another. His life is fused with that other;
moreover he feels eternally responsible for that other so long
as love lasts.
If sex were an evil in itself; if the exercise of sex were in
itself degrading, then it would most certainly be true that even
if engaged in for the sole purpose of propagation it would
be a sin.
If the engagement of sex is not a sin when so engaged,
then it follows that if Love is the base of the act, and if the
thoughts and desires of the heart be turned to God, it becomes
not only an act of creation, but also of worship, hence a Divine
Act and a divine act is a means of regeneration or
rebirth.
Moreover, if the act is engaged in for creation it is not a
sin, and if conception does not follow, what then? Is it
a sin? If it is, then who can foretell whether such an act
would be fruitful? If none can, and it is certainly true that
no one can, then, in order to be on the safe side three
things are essential:
First: The basis of the act must be Love and mutual consent.
Second: The possibility of pregnancy must be accepted.
Third: Because of the possibility that pregnancy may follow,
the act itself should be one of Love; with a desire to lift that
Love to God, and at the same time exchange the forces for
the upliftment, mentally, physically and spiritually, for the
benefit of those engaged in the act.

If the engagement of sex is not a sin when so engaged,
then it follows that if Love is the base of the act, and if the
thoughts and desires of the heart be turned to God, it becomes
not only an act of creation, but also of worship, hence a Divine
Act and a DIVINE ACT IS A MEANS OF REGENERATION OR
REBIRTH.
Moreover, if the act is engaged in for creation it is not a
sin, and if conception does not follow, WHAT THEN? Is it
a sin? If it is, then who can FORETELL whether such an act
would be fruitful? If none can, and it is certainly true that
NO ONE CAN, then, in order to be on the safe side THREE

These three Laws obeyed, and they are Laws, sin does not
follow the act and the result will be constructive and exalting.
The present cycle of immorality and unmorality in sex so
rampant throughout the world is mostly due to a moral degen-
eracy in the individual and a consequent lack of faith in his
fellow man.
By this we do not mean a moral degeneracy as concerns
sex alone, but in its relation to true manhood and personal
RESPONSIBILITY.
To illustrate this it is necessary to refer to the first open,
universal exemplification of this loss of manhood and per-
sonal responsibility—the "scrap of paper" incident of
the first world war. Quickly following in the wake of the
repudiation of his sacred word embodied in contracts, treaties,
etc., by the Kaiser, other men in high position, authority and
power followed his example and no longer was the word of
a man recognized by, or acceptable to, his fellow man.
The man "whose word was as good as his bond" ceased
to exist to all intent and purpose. This degeneration of the
MORALITY OF MANHOOD BROUGHT ON A DISREGARD OF
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
DEEPER INNER RESPECT FOR ONE'S WORD OF HONOR—
(A MAN'S WORD OF HONOR BEING SUPPOSEDLY HIS MOST
SACRED POSSESSION ASIDE FROM HIS DEEP FAITH IN GOD) —
AND THE DISREGARD FOR THE NECESSITY OF UPHOLDING
PROPERTY RIGHTS QUICKLY FOLLOWED.
With the loss of personal honor, manhood, the appreciation
of the sacredness and inviolability of one's word of honor and
loss of respect for the sacredness of property rights, it was
BOTH NATURAL AND INEVITABLE THAT WOMAN SHOULD
QUICKLY LOSE HER INNER CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER VIRTUES.

can create a debt, no matter what its nature, and become
free from it without he himself paying the full account.
This new concept is recognized as being at variance with
all the inculcations of religion he has received, hence his loss
of faith in religion and in God; he as yet is not able to differ-
entiate between what is taught as religion, and the actual

Loss of faith in religion, or perhaps more properly, the
church, is apparent by a steadily growing lack of attendance
at church services. The loss of confidence in his fellow men
has left man with nothing to believe in, with the result that
he has lost his spiritual anchor and has placed his trust in the
things he can see and feel; the pleasures and profits of the

Accepting this as true and long since having learned that
the most certain means for his highest sense of gratification
is found in sex, he has, to a large extent, made sex his god,
but without respect for the altar at which he serves.
What else can he do? Because of the manner in which
religion was served to him he no longer has respect for it.
He has confused religion as he understands it, with God, hence
has no respect for God. The men he knows are as sinful, as
unreliable, unpredictable and undependable as himself, there-
fore he is unable to place either trust or reliance in them.
All that is left to him is his sense gratification; worship
at the fount he knows will please and soothe, at least for a
time. The sex-god is his only god. It at least is ever-present,
never failing; the penalty is ignored, just as men ignore the
ultimate penalty for their broken promises.

Man's concepts must be changed. The interpretation of
Spiritual or Divine Laws must be reversed in such a manner
that men who are still honest at heart will be able to respect
the God who made them or gave them life. Man must be
made conscious of the duality of his being.
Man must become cognizant that there is a material and a
spiritual man; that the material man has rights and privileges,
but that the spiritual man must also be satisfied. He must
be made conscious that he is a personally responsible being;
held so by the Law and will be forced to pay to the "last
farthing," for any guilty infraction of the Law.
Once comprehending this, he will have respect for the Law
because it is a just Law, and he will feel a newborn respect
and reverence for the Giver of that Law.
Greatest of all is the need for men to come into the con-
sciousness that there is a law of substitution; a means
and method whereby they may be compensated, or compensate
themselves, for something needed or desired, by accepting
another thing if the thing desired is not to be obtained.
Furthermore, part of this Law of substitution is the Law of
exchange. Understanding this Law fully, men will select the

disadvantage to none.
Despite all appearances, it is fortunately not true as so many
fearfully believe, that in the present cycle of civilization sex
is debased as in no other age. History, both sacred and profane,
records greater and more universal immorality than at present.
Though, during these periods, sex practices were indulged
in to the degradation of all concerned, no one appeared to
have the slightest concept that there may be a holy, a spiritual
side to it; the nature of all things being in duality.
While the masses of today are guilty of gross degradation
and immoralities, and honor has fallen low, it is nevertheless
true that there is an ever-increasing number of both men and
women who are becoming conscious of the real meaning of
sex.
These recognize its correct and holy use and that, as it is
the means of generation, it is also of equal potency in the
REgeneration of both the individual and the Race.
Once this concept gains momentum, the pendulum will
swing to the right, as it is now to the left. A new cycle of
morality, sanctifying manhood and personal responsibility, as
well as a new and greater faith in God and in Laws that are
just and fair to all, will have its beginning. It is then when
both sex (Caesar), and the spiritual side of man, the Soul
(God), will receive proper and rightful consideration.
Men who have lost faith in God, hence in all Law, naturally,
gradually and unconsciously become unrestrained. Since there
is no law to obey, hence no threatened penalty, why not enjoy
life to the full, and what better medium is there than in the
semblance of love? Men either have a sense of honor, or they
do not. Even honor is based on Law.

and men will begin to respect both God and His Laws, and
as they gain respect, they will begin to obey the Law.
Teach men that while sex may be debased and degraded,
there being a mortal and lower side, there is also a holy,
sanctified, spiritual side based on real love and affection.
Just as the lowness of sex can and does debase, degenerate

In all honesty, whether one is priest or layman, it is unfair
to expect any man to respect sex, sanctify and exalt it, when
he is taught that sex in itself is evil; a necessary evil for the

It is equally erroneous to teach man either from a religious

otherwise he is a weakling and of little value either to him-

Man is born in ignorance. His actions are governed by in-

The wholly erroneous and misleading concept that repression
or depression of an unlawful impulse as related to sex expression
is less harmful physically and mentally than unlicensed or un-
hallowed expression, is no longer tenable.
If sex "urge" were merely a "desire" which might be brushed
aside as are the many other desires which assail man during
life, this might be true. But sex is not merely an impulse in
the strong, normal, healthy man. It becomes an all-pervading
urge; an almost unconquerable desire; a command by nature
for its exercise. What is the remedy? In Nature, its exercise
should be in a normal, natural manner.
That answer in itself is easy, but what if man is not so situated
as to give sex natural expression under the laws of marriage? The
answer is equally easy and the results will be the same, BUT
the practice is admittedly difficult: Substitution.
The youth must be taught ways and means to direct his life
forces to the enrichment of mind, body and Soul through various
activities: exercises, games, sports, recreation and all that helps
to build a healthy body. Man and youth are governed by the
same laws. It is right here where the Spiritual concepts are so
all-important that man and youth may have the strength to
withstand the tempter.
It is not true that repression as ordinarily known is less
harmful than expression, even if this be unlawful—from the
ethical-moral standpoint. Repression dams up the forces. It
sets up congestion. It produces inflammations and affects both
men and women.
Unlawful, that is, unnatural expression has the same effect
but in a different manner. Too long have we taught what we
like to believe and have misled mankind. We must now face

ties and potentialities to the full and in the manner intended.
Sex being the very foundation, the very beginning of his
existence, it implies that his creative ability must be exercised as
well as his constructive knowledge, all in a natural, normal
manner, but exercised they must be.
This again implies the "self." But this self must not be con-
fused with selfishness. Every man is born for the purpose of
improving himself and to that end is given every opportunity
to not merely help himself but to develop himself in every man-
ner possible.
It is his first DUTY to help—himself, before he even at-
tempts to help other men—humanity. By learning to help him-
self he gains the knowledge with which to teach others to help
themselves; helping himself, therefore, is a double duty.
If he can be made proud of himself and his capabilities, then
like the good husbandman, he will carefully and sacredly guard
everything, every means of value in his quest for perfection.
He will abuse or misuse nothing. All that he is, all that he
possesses, will be turned to good account; this includes sex.
To come to the crux of the matter, no Christian, using the
term in its esoteric sense as meaning one who has become con-
scious of the Christos or Christic Spirit within himself, will be
guilty of sex abuses or the abnormalities associated therewith.
Why not? Because to do so means self-pollution and self-pollu-

F THE many who have soiled countless reams of

it and place the blame where it rightly belongs.
How many millions of parents in the past have
asked the questions: "Why do girls allow themselves to be
led astray?" and: "Why do our girls, apparently deliberately,
choose the wrong path? Surely, they must know the difference
between right and wrong; between the status of the 'kept'
woman and the maiden who has remained unsullied?"
Roughly, we would classify the causes as follows:
1. A love of ease that is stronger than virtue or morality.
2. Love of pleasure that is greater than the desire for purity
and respectability.
3. The love of ease and position greater than the respect
for public opinion.
4. A love of possession stronger than any other desire.
In all these instances the desire for the things sought after
is greater and deeper than the longing for affection and to
be loved for the self alone. Little or nothing can be done to
prevent any one of these from following her natural inclina-
tion. Only misfortune, deep sorrow or great suffering will lead
one so insensible of virtue from the left-handed to the right-
handed path.

1. Those who fall into error because they love and are led
astray by the promise of love and its legitimate fulfilment.
These fall as a result of faith and trust. They are virtuous
and clean of heart; though they are betrayed, they are not
"fallen" women; never will be, because the love which caused
them to be misled and then failed them, will be turned into
love for their progeny.
The universal formula, varying but little, of those who have
misled them and will mislead millions yet unborn, is: "If
you love me you will do as I request; if you will not, then I
know you do not love me."
Since it is a universal law that women sacrifice for love,
it is a foregone conclusion that they will comply and, if the
lover is without honor, one more will be added to the great
army of those who have "loved," most probably innocently,
but not wisely. In almost all instances, these women make
good mothers and excellent wives for any man who will there-
after truly love them.

of girls in homes where there is neither peace nor happiness;
where they are given little attention and less encouragement.
These are homes where no love is shown them; where they
receive little or no instructions; where they are given no part
in the family relationship.
They are not wanted, or if they are, there is no real indi-

of the family, or that they have any responsibility in the family

wrong, but they are at a loss to know how to properly guide
them.
Evil itself is relative: the results of error are positive. It must
be recognized that there are many and varying degrees of
so-called "fallen" women. A girl may go astray; yet be truly
virtuous in heart and Soul, and following her "fall" may con-
tinue in virtue, or become bitter and a woman of ill-repute.
The direction of her action will depend entirely upon her
disposition, her environments and the understanding of those
around her.
The primary motive and cause must always enter into con-
sideration and judgment of each individual case. Any number
of girls, having made a mistake without evil intent, or led
into making a mistake, recognize it for what it is, then proceed
to reconstruct their lives and take their place in respectable
society.
If the truth must be told, they are probably the better and
more tolerant of others because of their unfortunate experience.
Others again, for one reason or another, for which they may
not be to blame, follow the downward path until disease, then

Every mother is aware, if she has given the subject any

explained; evasion and innuendos are misleading and delusive.
When the girl receives enlightenment on both the cause and
effect of her emotions, she will possess the weapon which
knowledge alone can give.
The fear that an open discussion over-reaches the desired
results, that the young are induced by curiosity to investigate
hidden paths after they have been instructed, is not a sane
or logical argument. The subject denuded of its false, insidious,
secret aspect, presented in a normal, unprejudiced manner,
will do much to curb undue interest. The beautiful, desirable
and constructive, as well as the hideous, damning and de-
structive phases, all must have consideration.
Knowledge may add intensity to the girl's nature, but innate
goodness, fortified with understanding, will be an incentive
for her to follow the right path. Normal girls, as a whole,
are naturally pure in thought and desire and will not be led
to ruin through knowledge. Ignorance alone is to be feared.
One manifestation of the feminine sex nature (often the
direct cause of the girl's undoing) scarcely, if ever, is given
the serious consideration it deserves. This is the instinctive,
inborn, mother-love nature, the natural inheritance of every
normal female.
The moment the true woman loves, at that instant does
she begin to seek a means to serve. It is her innate nature
inducing a longing in her to supply all the wants of the loved
one, whether of a social, mental or physical nature.
His comfort and well-being become her aim in life, and
if she be uninstructed, the whisperings of her conscience will
scarcely be heard and certainly avail nothing as against his
pleadings.

rule the actual reason for her compliance with his request; it
is the urge of the mother-love plus the desire to be possessed.
The ideal wife is half mother to the object of her love;
she serves her husband as though he were a child; grants all
his favors, whether demanded in or out of season.
A thorough explanation of this infinitely varied and complex
side of her nature must be offered the girl, thus guarding her
against an unwise sacrifice on the altar of love.
The actual purposes and usage of her creative nature are
not understood by one girl in a thousand; generally all the
information the many possess was gained from unreliable
sources; from companions as ignorant of the actual facts as

Because of this undesirable condition, the great need to
prevent the multitude of innocent girls being led astray into

Girls are best reached through the mother; boys through the
father. But fathers and mothers must first be taught the laws
and powers, uses and abuses of sex. Above all, the penalty
resulting from disobeying these sex laws, either through ignor-

daughter possessed some great talent, would she urge the girl
to dedicate it to the devil, having been informed that sin,

Despite the conjured-up picture, innumerable careless or
ignorant parents are brutally indifferent to even greater and

humanity, and the ignoble purpose to which sex is perverted
as a natural result.
It is not enough to preach of the swift penalty following
debasement of the creative function; the pure, exalted, sacred
purpose must be enlarged upon. The possibilities for good or
evil of the generative organism must be minutely taught; the
dark, secret, and destructive usages of which humanity is guilty
must be fully exposed.
Parents and teachers must search their own hearts for the
slightest trace of impurity of thought; youth being psychically
expert in sensing the least hint of shame, or the feeling of
self-consciousness. Many who are today invaluable as teachers
and leaders in the enlightening movement learned their lessons
after reaching maturity, or through great personal suffering
and the consequent adjustment, purification and self-effacement.
All these, as with one voice, proclaim the necessity of purity
of thought.
Of the many false conceptions respecting sex and its func-
tions, that of repression is the most destructive and degrading.
It has been impressed, more by inference than by actual words,
that woman is coarse and unwomanly if she allows sex desires
to become manifest. It has been taught that women, even if
passionate, should not express their real feelings, but hold
them in subjection, as something of which to be ashamed. Ad-
herents to such beliefs become victims of the goddess of
ignorance and gradually come to believe it unbecoming and
even unrighteous to display any emotion during the marital
rite.

humanity, and the ignoble purpose to which sex is perverted
as a natural result.
It is not enough to preach of the swift penalty following
debasement of the creative function; the pure, exalted, sacred
purpose must be enlarged upon. The possibilities for good or
evil of the generative organism must be minutely taught; the
dark, secret, and destructive usages of which humanity is guilty
must be fully exposed.
Parents and teachers must search their own hearts for the
slightest trace of impurity of thought; youth being psychically
expert in sensing the least hint of shame, or the feeling of
self-consciousness. Many who are today invaluable as teachers
and leaders in the eniightening movement learned their lessons
after reaching maturity, or through great personal suffering
and the consequent adjustment, purification and self-effacement.
All these, as with one voice, proclaim the necessity of purity
of thought.
Of the many false conceptions respecting sex and its func-
tions, that of repression is the most destructive and degrading.
It has been impressed, more by inference than by actual words,
that woman is coarse and unwomanly if she allows sex desires
to become manifest. It has been taught that women, even if
passionate, should not express their real feelings, but hold
them in subjection, as something of which to be ashamed. Ad-
herents to such beliefs become victims of the goddess of
ignorance and gradually come to believe it unbecoming and
even unrighteous to display any emotion during the marital
rite.
In the marriage rite, woman has every right to as great an
enjoyment as man. God gave passion equally to the male
and the female; therefore the coldness resultant from restraint

and of repression is unnatural. Under no circumstances should
natural desires be denied and repressed and their possession
considered with shame. Repression is the pathway to abnormal
physical and emotional upsets; and if continued for any length
of time, gives rise to degraded and perverted desire, followed
by practices destructive to creative ability. Admittedly,
passion should be held in proper subjection—wisely directed;
this calls for the exercise of the Will.
Many males, incorrectly termed men, subscribe to the theory
that women should repress their real feelings, then proceed
to condemn them for being cold; these have not yet reached
the degree of enlightenment where they are willing to grant
equality; have not arrived at an understanding of the necessity
of the normalcy and desirability of passion in women. These
men still remain in bondage to the past and consider it im-
modest for women to meet them with sincere feeling; possessing
a divine right for equal exchange.
Girls must be taught that normal, controlled sex power is
forever creative if rightly used and not abused; that if the
creative forces are diffused throughout the body, they become
the basis of strength and beauty of body, and brilliancy of
mind. The perfection of woman's form, the smoothness, loveli-
ness and texture of her skin, the sweetness of her voice and
the fire of her eyes all depend on, and are due to, this creative
energy.
When the girl finally comprehends that every part of her
nature is God's gift to her to be used according to His law,
she will rejoice in her possessions and nothing will be able to
tempt her to debase them, nor will she do ought that may
cheapen herself in any manner.

repression, trying to root out, or kill any desire or function,
is equally as wrong as misuse of that desire or function. Her
sole duty is to be mistress of herself; to control the passions
that at times rise and surge within her, until such time as she
meets the right mate who will prove his love by contracting
a partnership with her through holy wedlock.
Questions most frequently asked: "What are we to do
with our daughters while they are passing the dividing line
between girlhood and womanhood, possessed of an abundance
of life, love, and creative instinct; how can we help them to
control their desires?"
The first requisite is to keep the mind fully occupied with
duties to be performed, or problems to be solved. So long
as they are wholeheartedly interested in work and play, they
are safe.
Treat the girls as we do the boys. Boys are active creatures
and free themselves of excessive energy by work and athletics,
recreation and special interests. Allow the girl to romp and
be a tom-boy to her heart's content; you will never find the
seed of sex trouble as long as she does this. When that age
and stage is past, she must be induced to find interest in some
other task or practice.
Work given her must be neither monotonous nor confining.
Change is essential, as is time spent in the open air; and in
whatever constructive activity she centers her mind she must
be continually encouraged; it is imperative she have an incen-
tive to act.
Above all, the home life must be made pleasant, her
problems met with kindness, understanding and always
with great patience.

Admittedly, not all girls can be guided in this manner. In
the quiet, sedentary, studious, the pursuit most interesting to
them should be encouraged; while the more active physical
exercises should not be forced upon them. Music, painting,
the arts, whatever they can be interested in, should be indulged,
care being exercised that the fancy does not lead toward the
morbid.
Interest is the key. Instruct the girl in the laws governing
sex, then keep her interested and the entire problem finds
a solution of itself. The moment a girl becomes dissatisfied,
the danger signal quickly becomes apparent.
The duty of every mother is positive. She must as closely
devote her attention to the development of her daughter as
the father does to his business. A man pays careful attention
to every detail of his vocation, studies continuously how to
combat certain influences; how to remedy leakage and deficits;
is eternally vigilant. The mother's daughter is her business,
and she must apply herself in like manner. If all is not as
it should be, seek the cause; make necessary changes; be deft
in the art of substitution.
Far too frequently the normal, healthy, vivacious, active girl
is deprived of necessary innocent pleasures. She wishes to visit
a friend, attend the theatre, witness a game, go on a picnic,
or attend a party. These innocent pastimes are refused her;
she is thrown back upon herself; trouble brews, and a deplor-
able situation quickly develops.
Her mind becomes resentful; seeking an outlet for her
dammed-up energy, she allows her imagination to play too
freely, and if evil companions or blase stories have previously
opened the way, the devil steps in.

The average girl, at this stage of her development, is not
expected to set aside all pleasure; noble, elevating thoughts
alone will not sustain her at this period of her life. When
pleasures are denied, solitary vice, or secret meetings with the
undesirable of the opposite sex, are almost certain to follow.
The solution of the problem is found in:
1. Teaching the girl the creative laws in detail and frank-
ness; presenting every side clearly, especially dwelling on all
that is beautiful, fascinating, beneficial, and constructive to
herself and the race.
Invite questions and reply without hesitation, in chaste
language and without self-consciousness. Praise her (within
reason) to assist her in a correct valuation of herself. Be her
friend and confidant at all times and under all circumstances.
2. Supply her with work of an interesting nature. Dwell
much on the honor of housekeeping and motherhood. Tem-
porary employment about the house permits her to become
efficient in housekeeping, or preliminary training for a vocation
is highly desirable. Encourage the development of any apparent
talent.
Do not allow her to become one-sided and impractical.
Unless a girl has positive genius, it is better to encourage her
to do several things well. The sensible, adaptable woman
becomes the best wife and mother.
3. Exercise is one of the essentials. Any method, if con-
structive, is desirable. Games, tennis, rowing and walking are
all highly important. If these do not suffice or appear unsuit-
able, arrange for regular gymnastic work. The object is to
keep the body agile, the blood in active circulation, and the
creative forces distributed.

4. Amusements are as important as exercise. All pleasure
should combine harmless recreation with elevating tendencies.
It is questionable whether any but the most esthetic girls could
remain normal and free from vice without sufficient amuse-
ments.
Girls drift into the downward path because their require-
ments are neither recognized nor provided for by their natural
guardians. Parents fail in their duty and this neglect cannot
be corrected in after life.
During the formative period girls learn of matters concern-
ing sex, and more often than not, it is the degrading conception
that they acquire rather than an elevating comprehension of
the influence and potency of the functions and forces. Once
fully impressed with the wrong ideas, the girl becomes incap-
able of either understanding, or finding true love; consequently
she is condemned to live on the husks of affection.
Parents generally seem to make but little effort to understand
their daughters, their feelings, likes and dislikes, their inclina-
tions, weaknesses and strength. They urge them to accomplish
either too much or too little, allow them no amusements at
all, or satiate their desires by overdoing. A sane, balanced,
intelligent parent is a God-send, an angel of mercy, to any
child. Let us hope for more such in the near future.
The girl of the present is an independent creature and it
is unwise to either suspect her motives; accuse her of indis-
cretions, or to impute wrong to mere folly and inexperience.
Parents should be absolutely certain of their information before
even asking questions and never be guilty of making accusa-
tions. If there is guilt, meet it with understanding, sympathy
and corrective instructions.

said: "Throughout the domain of nature the instinct of sex is
paramount. In the highest kingdom of life the instinct is
subject to the modification of civilization which, alas, is not

The constructive path lies midway between the two extremes

the beauty and divinity of sex and quickly recognize the Laws
of God, controlling the functions, as just and righteous. Correctly
understood, the truths concerning sex do not bring a blush to the
most saintly cheek; nothing being discoverable in God's laws
to humiliate, or mortify man; the sense of shame belonging
only to those who live life shamefully.
Why should sex be considered impure? Can it be in itself
degrading? Only its abuse makes it so. Of itself, it is pure,
for God made all things pure. Why differentiate between
humans and animals, giving the latter all that is best in thought
and service, as respecting reproduction and the creating of a
superior species, while discouraging and condemning all that
concerns the like functions in man?
Is not a clean, virtuous, healthy woman God's greatest and
most beautiful handiwork, a thousandfold the superior of any
animal ever born? Why then is the human feminine degraded
by man, and the animal female studied, petted, and developed,
their duty and functions in the world of reproduction being
exactly alike?
The answer is not far to seek: The mind and heart of the
males, and many females (not men and women), have become
so perverted, defiled, and unspeakably filthy from dwelling in
lewd thought of contact, gratification and sensation, that the
spiritual side has never been recognized by them.

benefited equally with those who have pursued the opposite
course: that of license and debauchery.
The constructive path lies midway between the two extremes
and leads to the fountain of life; aye, the Fountain of Youth
so much sought. Those who choose this course in life discover
the beauty and divinity of sex and quickly recognize the Laws
of God, controlling the functions, as just and righteous. Correctly
understood, the truths concerning sex do not bring a blush to the
most saintly cheek; nothing being discoverable in God's laws
to humiliate, or mortify man; the sense of shame belonging
only to those who live life shamefully.

One is lost in the labyrinth of futile conjecture when attempt-
ing to find an answer for the foulness, ignorance and baseness
of many of the human species, the subject of sex generally
brings a knowing leer to the face, a licentious look to the eye,

information and incomplete understanding of God's Creative
function. In addition, there was also the actual and literal
encouragement of degraded, perverted, vile and untruthful

Evil thrives in darkness or ignorance, and almost every

be the basis or the laboratory for obscene thoughts and actions;
neither something to be ashamed of and degraded when dark-
ness covers the earth, thus being catalogued as evil along with
other destructive agencies that work in the night.
It is not an uplifting, ennobling thought for men, made
in the image of the Father, to believe that He created them
in such form, and with potencies for which they must forever
be apologetic. Yet this is just what the majority of "he" and
"she" creatures are continuously doing.
Sex in itself is pure. It is holy and exalting. When em-
ployed in the love-embrace its potency is beyond compute. In
the right use of sex, in generation and REgeneration, man is
endowed with a power angels might envy. Instead of striving
to understand the laws governing this great privilege and
possession of power, man continuously tramples this greatest
gift of a just God in the mire of sensuality and degradation,
thus failing even to realize the holiness of the function, the
halo of glory that should attend its consummation; wallowing
in perversion and voluntarily seeking the way to physical,
moral and spiritual ruin.
Ignorance of the creative function is the sole cause for
the general thought of impurity concerning it. Good and pure
in itself, it has been besmirched by the "demons of sense
gratification," until the thoughts of men are distorted and
they see falsely as "through a glass darkly." Men, having
defiled a benefaction of God, turn the use of a pure function
into unholy channels and then declare sex manifestations

be the basis or the laboratory for obscene thoughts and actions;
neither something to be ashamed of and degraded when dark-
ness covers the earth, thus being catalogued as evil along with
other destructive agencies that work in the night.
It is not an uplifting, ennobling thought for men, made
in the image of the Father, to believe that He created them
in such form, and with potencies for which they must forever
be apologetic. Yet this is just what the majority of "he" and
"she" creatures are continuously doing.
Sex in itself is pure. It is holy and exalting. When em-
ployed in the love-embrace its potency is beyond compute. In
the right use of sex, in generation and REgeneration, man is
endowed with a power angels might envy. Instead of striving
to understand the laws governing this great privilege and
possession of power, man continuously tramples this greatest
gift of a just God in the mire of sensuality and degradation,
thus failing even to realize the holiness of the fllnction, the
halo of glory that should attend its consummation; wallowing
in perversion and voluntarily seeking the way to physical,
moral and spiritual ruin.
Ignorance of the creative function is the sole cause for
the general thought of impurity concerning it. Good and pure
in itself, it has been besmirched by the "demons of sense
gratification," until the thoughts of men are distorted and
they see falsely as "through a glass darkly." Men, having
defiled a benefaction of God, turn the use of a pure function
into unholy channels and then declare sex manifestations
unclean and unfit for those spiritually inclined.
It is utterly impossible for a healthy, normal, noble-minded

ing its origin, such inquiries are usually avoided or untruth-

Can a greater injury be inflicted on a confiding Soul

aware that it has been deceived, will it not doubt the truth-

The degradation of sex has its beginning at this very point.
The child will soon be old enough to suspect something of
the truth and is unlikely to forget the explanation made by its
parents. Through companions equally ignorant, it will shortly
be informed, in the most degrading manner, of the bald, vulgar
aspects of the physical contacts of the sexes and the expectant
results, and the heretofore unsullied mind becomes contamin-

pristine purity or faith in its parents and their veracity.
The child naturally concludes that the parents were ashamed
of the creative act which called it into existence. It treasures
to itself the great secret. Its imagination pictures the intimacy
of human beings. The child, before its reasoning faculties
have fully unfolded, is convinced that the method of creation
must be an impure, unholy, and an unclean act; something to
be ashamed of, veiled in falsehoods.

What is the remedy? Seek to learn the truth respecting all
that concerns sex, and when your children commence to ques-
tion you, follow your love instinct and tell them the whole
truth, clothing it in words such as only mother-love can
command. Let it be similar to the following story-form:
"You can see this great world with its many men, women
and children, its green trees, the beautiful flowers, birds and
animals. There is another world in the distant beyond which
the eyes of the body cannot see. In that great other world
there are many Souls. To help you better understand what Souls
are, we will call them children who have no father or mother,
and who are more like good fairies. In their home they cannot
think or do anything wicked, but only those things which little
children should do if they love their mothers. In that home,
instead of mothers, there are good women or angels who con-
stantly watch over these little Souls. We call these good women
their guardian angels. They come to earth with the children
that come here.
"These little Souls seem to have everything they desire, but
they cannot know either pleasure or pain. They cannot know
what it is to love a mother, or to be loved by one, because they
possess no body such as we do, with which to feel, laugh or cry,
and run to when in trouble.
"They see the children on earth romp and play among them-
selves or with animal pets, in their garden of flowers, with their
little stubbed toes, mothers caressing and kissing their babies,
seeing them retire to sleep, mothers listening to their prayers
and fondly tucking them in their little beds.

instead of mothers, there are good women or angels who con-
stantly watch over these little Souls. We call these good women
their guardian angels. They come to earth with the children
that come here.
'These little Souls seem to have everything they desire, but
they cannot know either pleasure or pain. They cannot know
what it is to love a mother, or to be loved by one, because they
possess no body such as we do, with which to feel, laugh or cry,
and run to when in trouble.
"They see the children on earth romp and play among them-
selves or with animal pets, in their garden of flowers, with their
little stubbed toes, mothers caressing and kissing their babies,
seeing them retire to sleep, mothers listening to their prayers
and fondly tucking them in their little beds.

dare to discuss the doctrine that the sex function is the port of
entrance to the development of a superior race.
Often our demonstration does not end with contempt, but we
mercilessly condemn, shun, and even persecute and imprison
those who, through love for the unappreciative human race, dare
to teach mankind the truth concerning themselves and their crea-
tive potentialities.
Why do we so avidly seek to learn all we can about animal
husbandry; the proper mating, housing and feeding to insure
production of the highest grade of chickens, hogs, dogs and
cattle, while we condemn harshly those who would presume to
teach us the science for the development of the human race?
Is it because we really consider the sub-human creatures of
greater benefit to God and the Universe than his highest crea-

tions of the human race are less pure than those of the animals
upon which we bestow such great care? These are issues we no

instruct the child in the mysteries of plant life—fertilization
and culture—and believe this highly desirable for the child's
future welfare. (Actually, the creative organism of the plant is
in nowise greatly different from that of the animal creative and
productive function.) We proceed along this line and in teach-
ing horticulture, we instruct fully the dissection of the repro-
ductive organism of the plant, explaining how fecundation,
both natural and artificial, takes place.

language, that child and adult can quickly comprehend the
beauty, the chastity, the purity and the essentiality of sex?
This would be the simplest, easiest and most desirable method
of teaching the child, the parent and the public generally. The
lecturer, when dealing with congregations of people, should in-
struct through the functional analogy of the plant which so
closely resembles the human species. He can fully explain to
his audience the reproductive organism of the plant, the method
of fertilization, showing clearly the similarity between plant
and animal, animal and human, and HOW WEAKNESSES AND
DISEASES ARE AVOIDABLE while DESIRABLE TRAITS MAY BE
BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE.
In this manner the mind will conceive the wisdom of nature,
unconscious of the morbid, destructive and carnal thoughts and
desires usually aroused when sex is the subject of a lecture, or
when problems associated with sex are publicly discussed.
Is this so difficult? Not in the least. Text books on the cul-
ture of plants may be obtained by anyone. Through a careful
study of these text books anyone can readily become thoroughly
acquainted with the problem. Add to this an acquaintance with
animal husbandry, sex hygiene, eugenics and biology, and the
individual is intelligently prepared to meet the problem.
Why has this not been the approved method of procedure?
Why is this course not followed today? Because, for so many
centuries man has been taught to ignore, and abhor, the sex
question and all it represents. The most important side of the
problem has never been even thought of, much less discussed.
Universally, sex has been a subject of attention only when the
sun had set and the light turned out so that "darkness covered

The first necessity, therefore, is to arrive, through careful
study, at a thorough understanding of the entire subject. Man
must learn all that may be known of the exalted and spiritual
side of sex. He must analyze with an open mind all that is
learned; thus finding its desirable, constructive side, just as he
seeks and finds the beauties in a highly developed flower.
In the consideration of this important question, we must
avoid extremes; must ignore the dark side—that which brings
dishonor, disease, misery, degradation and death—though will-
ing to give it the recognition which its possibilities for evil
demands.
We should likewise religiously avoid discussions in season
and out of season, bearing in mind the Biblical injunction:
"There is a time and a season for all things." We should dis-
courage the discussion of the sex question in public gatherings
of mixed audiences unless it happens to be a meeting called for
that express purpose.
At the moment when humanity is awakening to the tremen-
dous importance of sex hygiene, there are many opportunities
to inculcate the truth, but we should be extremely careful to do
this in a dignified manner as becomes true and enlightened men
and women. We should never make reference to anything con-
cerning sex in a ribald, or what might appear, vulgar manner;
nor by giving our silent consent to others who may be guilty,
thereby doing grave injury to the cause for the development of
a superior race.
In attempting to discuss this great and vital subject before
the people, whether a gathering of those who desire to become
teachers, parents, or children having reached the age of com-
prehension of so important a subject, we must honor it by our
personal appearance. The discussion must be dignified, fearless

and honest, to impress upon the minds of the audience the
necessity for the truths embracing the Divine Creation and the
glory of race regeneration.
If those to whom we bring this important information are
not fully informed, we should begin our instructions by means
of analogy; thence proceed to the sub-human, and gradually
unfold the mystery of the creative ability and organism of the
human. We must illustrate in simple language the purpose and
power of each organ of creation, designating them by compre-
hensive names readily understood by the audience, yet far re-
moved from the vulgar expressions familiar to every boy and
girl in school.
The greatest success, especially before young people, depends
upon our appearance as a speaker, and the manner in which
the subject is presented. If we are thoroughly conversant with
the entire problem, if we are at ease, free from self-conscious-
ness, and, if we believe all that we teach, then it will not be
difficult to inculcate in the young the belief that sex, in all its
offices, is both sacred and divine.
The most difficult phase of our work will be to prove to man,
woman and youth, that sex is NOT the degraded avenue of pas-
sion it has always been taught, or believed to be; an inheritance
heartily to be ashamed of—but man's highest and holiest gift
from a Creative God.
Sex, admittedly, has a dark, a very dark side. The perversion
of sex has brought disease and degradation to countless num-
bers. The exaltation of the same potential force will bring
health, longevity, and Immortalization. Like all forces in na-
ture, it is dual in its potentialities and manifestations, depending
entirely upon the method of exercise. It is left to the free choice
of individuals, whether they will employ this power for a

and honest, to impress upon the minds of the audience the
necessity for the truths embracing the Divine Creation and the
glory of race regeneration.
If those to whom we bring this important information are
not fully informed, we should begin our instructions by means
of analogy; thence proceed to the sub-human, and gradually
unfold the mystery of the creative ability and organism of the
human. We must illustrate in simple language the purpose and
power of each organ of creation, designating them by compre-
hensive names readily understood by the audience, yet far re-
moved from the vulgar expressions familiar to every boy and
girl in school.
The greatest success, especially before young people, depends
upon our appearance as a speaker, and the manner in which
the subject is presented. If we are thoroughly conversant with
the entire problem, if we are at ease, free from self-conscious-
ness, and, if we believe all that we teach, then it will not be
difficult to inculcate in the young the belief that sex, in all its
offices, is both sacred and divine.
The most difficult phase of our work will be to prove to man,
woman and youth, that sex is NOT the degraded avenue of pas-
sion it has always been taught, or believed to be; an inheritance
heartily to be ashamed of-but man's highest and holiest gift
from a Creative God.
Sex, admittedly, has a dark, a very dark side. The perversion
of sex has brought disease and degradation to countless num-
bers. The exaltation of the same potential force will bring
health, longevity, and Immortalization. Like all forces in na-
ture, it is dual in its potentialities and manifestations, depending
entirely upon the method of exercise. It is left to the free choice
of individuals, whether they will employ this power for a

utter destruction of the Soul itself.
How many would think of using a prayer to curse another?
Though there are many men who have lost all respect for re-
ligion and disclaim belief in God, yet few of these could be in-
duced to voice a prayer for the purpose of calling down a curse
upon another. Why? Because through their entire life they
have been taught that prayer is for but one purpose; either to
ask God for a favor, or for requesting a blessing upon another.
There is but one universally-accepted meaning attached to
prayer; and that is for good. As a matter of fact, prayer or sup-
plication may be as readily voiced in calling forth a curse upon
another as in invoking a blessing; but, fortunately, the race has
been taught only its higher purpose.
As with prayer, so with the procreative function. If once we
can bring mankind to a realization that sex is a blessing and not
a curse; a thing of beauty and not an abomination; if we can in-
still a full comprehension that sex is like a prayer, pure in itself,
holy in all its natural functions, and for good only, then will
mankind conceive sex in an entirely different light. Up to the
present the accursed idea of sex has been the only side presented
to humanity, while the good has been ignored, and even denied
as having existence.
Within recent years men have gone rampant on business effi-

for REgeneration—a rebuilding of the entire being. When sex
is abused, it is like poison to the mental faculties; it colors the

attractiveness leaves him, his friends feel he has changed and
he is no longer magnetic. The work formerly accomplished

DANGEROUS PERIOD OF LIFE
PUBERTY
uberty is that period in the life of a girl when her
procreative organism has reached the development
necessary to function as required by Nature for the
conception of a new being. Undoubtedly, Nature
had primarily intended that when this stage was
reached she should have attained full bodily growth, and be
prepared to do her full duty as a member of the human family.
It is likewise the period of her life—and this is most impor-
tant—when her parents are no longer responsible before God
for her action, and she herself must assume full responsibility
for her thoughts, desires and acts.
Unfortunately, in all too many instances, the laws governing
the development of the body have not kept pace with those giv-
ing life and activity to the creative functions, and at this age it
is possible for almost any girl to conceive, three or five years
before her physical structure is fully developed.
Because of this anomaly the physical body is that of a girl
who should be happy with her dolls or in the companionship
of other boys and girls, while the mind and desires are those of
a fully developed woman.
When a girl has reached this stage of life we find it difficult
to keep her innocent in thought and free from acts which might
be wholly to her detriment in later life. On this account, the
period during puberty is most dangerous. Every care must be
exercised by the mother or guardian to avoid any misstep that
might lead the girl astray and ruin her chances for happiness.

MYSTERY OF SEX
A few months before the beginning of puberty we have a
girl wholly carefree and happy, and undisturbed by any feeling
of self-consciousness in the companionship of boys. She takes
part in their games and sports with carefree abandon, possibly
failing to recognize, at least consciously, that there is a difference
between the sexes. Then, almost imperceptibly a change takes
place. A transformation of her entire being is in process. Her
mental attitude changes, with surprising suddenness, from
that of a boyish girl, into that of a woman, and here is the dan-
ger: she is torn between the feelings of the boyish girl and that
of the awakening woman.
With the awakening of sex activity (biological urge and
longing for affection), life appears totally different from what
it seemed but a short time before; bewilderment and painful
self-consciousness takes the place of the former instinctive
activity.
The girl may be likened to the uncouth youth, who is aware
that there is a correct way to enter a room filled with people,
but unable to properly proceed; the greater his effort to appear
self-possessed and self-confident, the more likely he is to act
awkwardly and ungainly. The girl is fully conscious that the
former indiscriminate carefree association with those of the op-
posite sex can no longer be continued, but she is uninformed as
to just what is the proper thing to do and how to go about it.
Long before this period in the girl's life the wise mother will
have informed her daughter of just what to expect; when and
in what manner to expect it and what should be done to meet
the situation. Happy and fortunate is the mother who has not
failed her daughter and allowed her to obtain such information
from associates or older persons ignorant of the true facts, for

as usual with her. There appeared nothing unusual so far as her
physical well-being was concerned but, as she expressed it,
"something warm seemed to flow."
Almost unconsciously she placed her hand to the mouth of
the vagina, and, on withdrawing, found it covered with blood.
Naturally, she was dumbfounded and did not know what move
to make. In this dilemma she turned to her companions who
were as ignorant, and happily, as innocent as she. The concur-
rent conclusion arrived by the consultation was that the best
thing to do was to secure a cloth and cold water; that possibly
it was no more than an ordinary nosebleed with which they were
familiar.
The cloth and cold water were secured and applied, with the
result that the flow ceased and a chill set in, the child having
been perspiring freely, due to exercise. When the time came
for the next periodical flow, there was no indication of it, but
instead a chill and swelling of the limbs. A physician was con-
sulted. He suspected something out of the ordinary; questioned
the girl until she informed him of the former occurrence. For
many years thereafter this girl suffered severely at each monthly
period, all due to the failure of the mother to properly instruct
her. If the mother herself were ignorant then she should have
taken the girl to the family physician for proper instructions.
Occurrences of this nature are well nigh universal, which cer-
tainly does not speak well for our twentieth century enlighten-
ment and our boast of being intelligently informed on all im-
portant subjects. It is distinctly not an honor to us to be forced
to admit that more than nine-tenths of our girls reach the age
of puberty without the slightest knowledge of the phenomena
of life before them.

the young man does to his first long trousers—an emblem of

Not all motherhood is based on ignorance. We have in mind
a mother of the enlightened age; one blessed with several daugh-

who prepares their food and looks after their clothing—she is
also their companion. Just as these girls come to their mother
with their studies, so do they go to her with their confessions,
their problems and their questionings.
If Johnny Jones happens to display his wisdom of the world
and gives expression to some remark they do not understand,
they appeal to their mother for an interpretation. She, wise
mother, instead of showing self-consciousness on her part and
telling them to be ashamed to repeat "such a remark," tells
them just what he did mean and then proceeds to give them a
full explanation of it in language chaste and pure.
These girls never ask a companion for an explanation of a
remark they do not understand. They wait until evening and

cedure be followed in her consideration. Instead of urging her
to activity and intensive study, as we should do with boys, it is
essential to as nearly as possible allow her complete rest during
the four or five-day menstruation period, nor dare we incite her
to difficult mental activity either directly before or after the

Our present system is to consider boys and girls during ado-

accorded them must be diametrically different if good is to re-

ina?

companionship with the boys as formerly, hugging and kissing
them, and taking part in all their games, the normal girl with-

ithout doubt, the great majority of men have been
doing this very thing on their wedding night, and, as
a result of this tragic beginning, were never again
able to rewin the respect and affection their wives
had for them as sweethearts.
Women, with certain exceptions, are peculiarly constituted
by their Creator. It matters little how greatly a woman may
love, how deep her longing to be possessed, or how ready and
even anxious she may be to give herself to the embrace; she
nevertheless expects her suitor to entreat her for the favor re-
quested; secretly hoping that he will not give up until he has
caressed her into submission.
This instinct, longing or desire, call it what we will, is born
in the heart of every real, desirable, womanly woman. All men
can well make this great, vital truth a part of their lover's creed.
If a man is truly a man, as he expects the woman to be a wo-
man, and if he but partially understands her—what man can
do more—he will play his part of the lover with knightly bear-
ing and with forebearance.
He will feel within himself that she has a right to expect
this small consideration from him if his desire merits her com-
pliance and in doing his part, it is certain that an understanding
of the innermost desire of her nature will return many pleasures
and blessings.

in the heart of every real, desirable, womanly woman. All men
can well make this great, vital truth a part of their lover's creed.
If a man is truly a man, as he expects the woman to be a wo-
man, and if he but partially understands her-what man can
do more-he will play his part of the lover with knightly bear-
ing and with forebearance.
He will feel within himself that she has a right to expect
this small consideration from him if his desire merits her com-
pliance and in doing his part, it is certain that an understanding
of the innermost desire of her nature will return many pleasures
and blessings.

MYSTERY OF SEX
The sorrows and unhappiness rampant in the lives of the vast
majority of married couples can be traced to the way of approach
on the wedding night. Whether the wrong approach is due to
ignorance or lack of manhood does not matter.
Generally speaking, the average man has in mind but one
predominant idea: compliance with the privilege he believes
to be his. He never gives a thought as to why this privilege
should belong to him.
He is totally unaware of the duties devolving upon him with
the compliance of the favors he seeks or expects. He foolishly
imagines—if he thinks about it at all—that his whole duty has
been fulfilled in the fact that the woman of his choice has con-
sented to become his wife; that he has married her and is pro-
viding a home for her together with the necessities of life.
In exchange for all this he feels that she is forthwith and
thereafter bound to take care of his home, grant his requests
when he is so minded, and both bear and care for his children
when they accidentally result from his embraces.
All too often the woman is equally at fault; expecting a
home, the possessions which make life desirable, with very lit-
tle self-denial on her part, but much love and affection, in re-
turn or exchange for the least possible effort on her part.
Laboring under such false conceptions relative to their re-
spective duties and privileges, the average man and woman are
wed; enter the marriage chamber; and emerge in the morning,
very much the wiser, though a great deal sadder for their ex-
perience of a few short hours, a feeling of mutual disgust ensues,
with a cooling love for him on her side, and dissatisfaction with
her on his side.
As an illustration, let us cite a case of which we happen to
possess all the facts:

The young man we have in mind looked upon woman as the
queen of heaven; would not believe that any woman could
stoop to sell her body, and had an idea that all women were
very much misunderstood—in which last supposition, of course,
he was more or less correct. This youngster had some knowledge
of sex laws, though totally ignorant of the wisdom which makes
man a successful lover. He "fell in love" with a young lady of
nearly his own age and believing his emotion fully recipro-
cated, married her.
They entered the bridal chamber, and like all of his kind—
naturally so—he requested, caressed and coaxed for the privi-
lege of a complete consummation of the marriage rite. Do
what he would, the lady refused, turning away from him. She
rather coldly informed him that had she married a young man
of her acquaintance (a former suitor), she felt that he would
have loved her without making such a request.
The husband's ideals relative to women, love, marriage and
the inception and birth of children were extremely high. He
never would have given a thought to marriage had he enter-
tained the slightest doubt that he had the love of the woman.
It is easy therefore to picture the effect such a statement had
upon him. It chilled him to the very center of his Soul, and the
love he formerly had for the woman who was now his wife suf-
fered a shock from which he never fully recovered. The mem-
ory of the incident remained to haunt him and to loom up ghost-
like when thereafter he was prompted to repeat his request.
This experience is merely an example of countless others,
with slight variation one way or another, that occur daily

result of the faulty instructions girls receive from their mothers.

tions, his admiration and caresses are so welcome and so highly
treasured.
Man's life is his business. Through force of circumstances
the most affectionate man living often appears to accept love as
merely a side issue. This is seldom because his love is less sin-
cere and less true than a woman's, but because he is the protec-
tor of his home and the one upon whom devolves the necessity
of supplying the needs of the family.
In this he resembles the primitive man who often was obliged
to leave wife and family for weeks at a time to secure the food
they required. He did not voluntarily deny himself their com-
panionship; necessity compelled him to do so.
Similarly the man of affairs must meet the keen competition
of today and center his entire mind and whole attention on the
achievement of success. Apparently he does not think of his
wife, but deep in his consciousness there is an abiding love
which manifests through his efforts to accomplish for her sake.
Should he at times forget the REgenerative Law of his being
and request favors without the usual caresses, she must not
hastily conclude that his love has waned or be foolish enough
to accuse him of having in mind merely the gratification of his
senses. This has led to countless disasters.
Woman's intuition is usually correct if her personal feelings
do not becloud it, and will tell whether he really has ceased to
care, or his action merely an oversight of which all men are
sometimes guilty. Although it may be necessary or advis-
able for her to call his attention to his seeming carelessness, she
should be tactful in her manner and not accuse him of a delib-
erate neglect of which he is really innocent.

The one time in a man's life when he really desires peace and

indulgence of the passionate nature. Love itself may be mani-
fested at times by other means than the embrace; and because
a man caresses his wife daily is no reason he should that fre-
quently be permitted indulgence in the marriage rite. The
good Book informs us: There is a time and a season for all
things. While there may be endearments and caresses when-
ever opportunity offers, exercise of the rite itself should not be
sufficiently frequent to induce weakness. It should never be
undertaken while there is either ill-feeling or a misunderstand-
ing between the two, as this poisons mind and body and grad-
ually builds up resentment one toward the other.
One of the most important requisites for the newly-married
pair to learn is the necessity of controlling the passion if the
union is to be a happy one. This applies to the woman no less
than to man.
The theory that woman is usually passionless is wholly
wrong, or if true, is regrettable. Youthful married people who
have not been properly instructed in this respect are apt to
fall into error and the embrace becomes an enervating habit
rather than constructive exercise of the creative function. They
must quickly realize that marriage does not give them the
privilege of indulging to satiation; no individual should be
guilty of such abuse and the marriage ceremony does not
grant any right to do so.
It is the law in the creative realm that the more frequently
the desire of the male in youth is gratified the oftener will
there be a desire for indulgence. There should be a covenant
between the twain, stipulating that the Rite may be indulged
only so many times a week. If this is respected, their self-denial
will be amply rewarded.

feels disgust at the mere thought of it. Because of this ignor-
ance and selfishness the exercise is hardly ever performed in a
divine and holy manner but becomes a purely mechanical
matter-of-fact, uninspired process. Here, indeed, is one of the
main causes for much of the dissatisfaction in married life.
If a man does not love a woman to the extent of wanting to
caress and kiss her before he indulges in the Rite, and to do so
after the completion of the embrace, he does not really love her;
the most that can be said for him is, that he is impassioned by
her. Under such conditions he has no right to request her
favors; to do so is to prostitute his powers and energies.
The lover's kiss, like the creative exercise, has been much mis-
understood and abused. It is as sacred in the sight of God as the
marriage Rite. The kiss is the symbol of true love, an emblem of
affection; or, it may be the badge of hypocrisy—the kiss of
Judas. It is sanctioned only between those who love each other,
between women who are good friends, and between relatives.
Any other indulgence is hypocritical and degrading to those
kissing. On this basis it should be readily understandable how
undesirable it must be in instances where the kiss is exchanged
between those who dislike each other, aye, even come to hate
each other.
Women are most frequently the lawbreakers. Who has not
observed women kissing each other even when known to be
bitter enemies? This is comparable to the famous Biblical kiss
of Judas.
Another cause for the cooling of affection and what was once
intense love may in some instances depend on temperamental
differences, or can be traced to the general practice of continually
sharing one bed. The married should sometimes occupy separate
beds, and, when possible to arrange, often separate rooms, that

Woman is not alone guilty. Indeed, the man frequently be-
comes more careless than she. Before marriage, he was a man
in every respect; neat in appearance; gentlemanly in deport-

manner, after marriage, may seem too much trouble, but
he must realize that her love means his happiness and he
should exert every effort to retain it.

if he attempts to change her attitude. There never can be

speeches and little flatteries are always desired by the real
woman. All of them are a part of her being.
Irrespective of how prosaic or practical life may be, how
many sorrows may be her share, these little attentions are as
ointment to wounds; together they comprise the foundation
of her continued love for him. He should gladly and freely

the emotion of either love or hate. She must never for a
moment permit herself to forget that man can completely
divorce passion from love. He can actually have passion for
a woman without feeling any love for her, though he is not
master enough to love a woman for whom he cannot feel
passion.
In woman's sphere, except in rare cases, this is entirely
different. Although she may be passionate, she will seldom
allow her desires to be aroused unless she loves. Men and
women are distinctly different from each other in their affec-
tional natures. To obtain happiness and avoid grievous mis-
takes which often lead to sorrow and unhappiness, each must
not judge the other by his or her own nature.
Dr. P. B. Randolph, often termed the world's greatest
philosopher of love, stated it as a law, that woman will
forgive a man if he so far forgets himself as to have sexual
congress with another woman, but will never pardon him
if she learns he has been caressing, kissing, and loving her,
because this would be an affront to her own affectional nature,
the law of her existence.
On the contrary, a man may forgive his wife when guilty
of infatuation for another man, but will never do so if he

If she is true-hearted and loving, and we are considering

and considers every part of her being and of woman generally,
as beautiful and desirable. If ever he foolishly attempts any
slighting allusion, no matter what the motive, to her creative
organism, or any other part of her body, especially of her
breasts, she will be so deeply wounded that she will rarely,

The case of a little woman coming to us suffering from

acquainted with both the young people before their marriage.
She was a jolly little girl, a good companion, carefree and
lovable. He was quite serious and apparently ignorant of

plumpness, especially the roundness of her breasts. On one
occasion, just before the embrace, he foolishly made the remark
that he did not like the appearance of her breasts as well
as he did before they were married.
This cut her to the quick, causing her to brood over her
loss, and inducing her to try every means in her power to
regain her former symmetry, but all to no avail. The continual

appearance, did not in the least imply that he loved her less

he might even love her more when in this plight, because

What a man "likes" and what he actually "loves" are two
entirely different things. This is readily shown by the self-
evident fact that a man likes to see his wife well and strong,
but may dearly love her even though she is seriously ill. Once

demanding too much, the other not refusing too much. In
all cases, understanding and compromise alone can be the
foundation of both satisfaction and happiness.
There are well-defined indications of the right use of sex
laws which, if observed and followed, will give the correct
answer to every questioner. So long as the embrace is exercised
by two people who love each other, and a feeling of well-
being and joyousness, without a hint of shamefulness, is re-
sultant, it is a clear and unmistakable indication that there
has been no over-indulgence. When the man feels equal to
the day's task and is enabled to do it easily and cheerfully,
when the woman finds it a joy and satisfaction to perform her

the act is an incentive.
The man and woman whose present, and future, welfare
signifies more to them than the immediate pleasure of indul-
gence, will regulate their conduct in this respect. The slightest
hint of weakness or lassitude should be accepted as a warning;
an indication of over-indulgence, a warning that the frequency
of the embrace must be reduced. When good results follow
a stated regime, the parties concerned are justified in believing
that all is as it should be. In general, young married people
should agree to certain elastic rules and regulations governing
the exercise and adhere to them. Three times a week is usually
a safe and sane rule to abide by.

"That Which is Worth Doing is Worth Doing Well"
IIP
ll of us are familiar with the old maxim, but how
few of us are actually governed by it in our actions!
This precept is most emphatically applicable to the
important subject now under consideration, but
should be made even more positive: "If a child is
to be born it has a right to be born well."
God's greatest and most sublimely mysterious gift to man

The Laws of Prenatal influence, on the other hand, govern
the impressions made directly upon the child by the parents,
especially the mother, of qualities, powers, potentialities and
capabilities, as also virtues and vices not native to the parents,
but which they have the power to direct to the child. It can
be readily understood that generally Prenatal influences have
a much wider field of influence and are of far greater import-
ance than Heredity.
Many scientific men ridicule the possibility of investing the
unborn with powers and virtues not possessed by the parents.

strength and beauty of physique, and greatness of Soul.

ened, hence totally failing her in all her needs. Will God hold
her responsible, society as a whole having failed her?
Such a picture of the shortcomings of the individual and
society, plus the results following, is certainly not a pleasant
one. It illustrates many other experiences of like nature. We
exempt this woman from blame because of her ignorance and
weakness, but we cannot hold the modern woman blameless
because she has every opportunity to gain full knowledge of
the laws governing the creative function and the rightful,
constructive use of diis great gift and capacity with which the
Creator has endowed her.
It is easily possible for any woman of ordinary intelligence
to become the mother of a race of mental, physical, spiritual
giants, of mental and spiritual masters.
How?
By instructing her in all the duties she owes to herself as
a woman and to the race having its beginning with her. She
can be taught to think constructively and gloriously; to study
helpful instructive books; to select the foods for their body-
building and health-giving value. She can be carefully taught
exercises that will develop the mind, the Will and her entire
physical being. She can acquaint herself with the Laws which
will enable her to "build" an outstanding new temple for the
reception of a Soul, directly from "heaven."
Such a woman will love both well and wisely. She will
marry. She will see to it that the creative forces are not
dissipated or, in Biblical terms, "cast upon the ground" to
damn her and her progeny, and she will, in due and proper
time, conceive. She will study the books she is assured will
have an elevating and constructive influence on the mind of
both herself and the child later to be born, be it boy or girl.

She will not permit obscene or suggestive pictures in the
house, nor attend plays or movies which are suggestive, de-
grading or debasing. She will associate only with cultured
people who use chaste language. She will be careful when
bathing; taking cold baths for stimulation; warm baths for
cleanliness and relaxation.
She will follow a system of physical exercise and breathing
drills; keep fully and interestingly occupied, and avoid every-
thing that might possibly be nerve-shocking or that would
tend to induce hysteria.
Above all, she is careful in the selection of her diet, avoid-
ing all articles of food that could possibly congest the system

She refuses marital relationship with her husband unless

Let us suppose this child to be a girl. The mother instructs
her in the truth as she was taught; trains her under all the
laws governing the development of her true womanhood.
This child, on reaching adolescence, then motherhood, in her
turn teaches and develops her children in like manner. Can
we even begin to estimate what this will mean to the nation
within a few generations? We can, however, form some con-
ception of the influence such superior men and women would
have on the affairs of nations, their morals being uncorruptible.

laws governing the development of her true womanhood.
This child, on reaching adolescence, then motherhood, in her
turn teaches and develops her children in like manner. Can
we even begin to estimate what this will mean to the nation
within a few generations? We can, however, form some con-
ception of the influence such superior men and women would
have on the affairs of nations, their morals being uncorruptible.

It cannot be successfully argued that this is purely a dream
of an ideal state, impractical in every day life. Men and women
can obtain good literature as readily as destructive, vulgar, and
obscene publications. They need have no greater difficulty in
securing beautiful pictures than those depicting destruction
or vulgarity. They can keep mind and body occupied instead
of catering to their "nerves"; can walk and exercise in place
of lounging about the house or club; and have the choice of
attending good plays and operas instead of choosing question-
able shows. What is even more important, they can obtain
good, nutritious, nerve and brain building foods as cheaply as
rich meats, sweets, cookies, candies, spiced articles and useless
desserts having no actual value to the body, but clogging the
entire eliminative system, producing weakness and low mental
states.
A sane, sensible, purposeful life is no more difficult to live
than is a destructive, aimless existence. It is merely a question
of choice. Just as many are perfectly satisfied to live in an old,
leaky, ramshackle hovel, though having the opportunity to
move into a modern, sanitary, well-appointed dwelling, so the

If we desire strong, healthy, superior babies, we must go
back a step beyond consideration of the Laws of Heredity and

training them to eradicate all that is weak and undesirable—
all this before they have even reached the age of responsibility.
We must carefully and thoroughly instruct them in all the
laws pertaining to environments, imitation, personal and Pre-

this is half the battle; that while Heredity is the foundation,
Pre-natal influences and impressions are the building; one is
quite as important as the other.
Is this labor worth the effort? While we are in youth and
the world looks bright and rosy, we have no little loved ones
of our own whose suffering we must witness. As we advance
in years, many little feet cross our path, some of them our
own, and as we see their suffering and are helpless to relieve

wisely as humanly possible. At the correct time, after the
female conceives, the male is non-existent to her and Heredity
or the Law of Mendel governs from then on until the young
are born.
Mating and the bearing of young in the animal kingdom
are governed by natural law; the owner merely selects mates
best suited to each other and to offset or eliminate weaknesses.

service a male lengthy of head with heavy coat. By this

heaviness of coat as well as greater length of head. However,
admittedly, we were confronted with the great unknown:
which of the mating pair possessed the greater transmitability?
If the female happens to be more virile than the male,
then it is altogether possible for her to transmit to the young
her own characteristics and this would naturally cause her
young to be much like herself. At the same time, despite
the potency of her greater vitality, we still expect heavier
coats for the young than she possesses, because vitality is one
of the factors needed to produce a heavy coat.
If the male possessed the greater vitality, then we confi-

This law can be even more clearly illustrated. There are
several distinct types of Collies. The one most commonly known
is the Sable and White; next the Tricolor, usually black, sable
and white—being black of body, with white markings and sable
around the eyes and possibly the mouth; lastly, the Blue Merle.
By mating a pair of Sable and White we would naturally
look for young of the same color, with perhaps some modifica-
tion of the tint. But there is no certainty; it is altogether pos-
sible that out of a litter of six healthy pups, five will be Sable
and White, while the sixth may be a Tricolor, or even a black.
What is the explanation for such an occurrence?
It merely indicates that, several generations back, one of the
ancestors, either of the male or female, was a Tricolor, and that
in the blood of one of the present parents there still remain
some of the blood cells of this fore-parent.
Thus we have a "throw-back" or reversion of type. This
impregnation of a cell of a former generation is identical to
the transmission from parent to child of a disease, such as syph-
ilis; though the transmitter is apparently not in the least
afflicted with it. Of this we will speak later.
If a pair of fairly evenly matched Collies are mated, let us
say of the desired length of head, heaviness of coat, and strength
of bone; not too closely related; if the care and the food of the fe-
male is as it should be, we may confidently expect the young
to possess the features of the parents; healthy and strong, and of
like color.
Such a rule does not always govern the human family. If
the parents are too much alike in features, temperaments and
other characteristics, even though not at all related, the children
resulting from the union, if any, may be the direct opposite of
parents.

In the human family, the rule generally governing is: "Like
produces like." If the parents are equal, in vitality, or nearly
so, the likeness is more frequently after the mother rather than
the father. This is for the reason that, while the father supplies
the seed of life, and all of the future human monad is contained
in this Spermatozoon, including the basis for health or the
inoculation of an inherited disease, as the case may be, it is the
mother who, during the period of gestation, fashions the new
being by her mental attitude and mode of life in general. The
thoughts of her mind, the passions of her entire being, and the
emotions of her heart, profoundly impress the being in the pro-
cess of creation.
If the mother-to-be is fully enlightened in the Creative Law,
she is enabled to bring forth a god-man, a superior being,
even though the father is practically a nonentity. Her work
can extend to giving the child a healthy body and powerful
virility, though the father is a weakling, provided, of course,
that his blood is not filled with germs of syphilis or other trans-
mittable disease, and his nerves and brain untainted with in-

We modify this last statement and claim that even these—
cancer and syphilis—can be eliminated by the mother during
the time of gestation.

the child favored the mother, we do not wish to be understood

In the human family, the rule generally governing is: "Like

the father. This is for the reason that, while the father supplies
the seed of life, and all of the future human monad is contained

even though the father is practically a nonentity. Her work
can extend to giving the child a healthy body and powerful
virility, though the father is a weakling, provided, of course,
that his blood is not filled with germs of syphilis or other crans-
mittable disease, and his nerves and brain untainted with in-

We modify this last statement and claim that even these--
cancer and syphilis--can be eliminated by the mother during
the time of gestation.
Although we have made the statement that most frequently
the child favored the mother, we do not wish to be understood
as maintaining that this is always so. A superior man wedded
to an honest, lovable, but inferior woman is enabled to father
a genius by obedience to the law following.

that he concentrates every force within his being, and if the
marital Rite is consummated at this time, he is, at the moment
of the climax, thoroughly positive in every department of his
little world.
If the woman granted his request after being thoroughly
awakened to desire through endearments, giving him her love,
and if he, during the entire embrace, especially at the moment of
highest bliss, concentrates his mind on the one object of calling
into existence a healthy, normal, and superior child, he is en-
abled to draw the potential forces from Heaven itself. This
longing, hurled into space, will become a part of the child to
be.
He is enabled to still further influence the health, strength
and character of the coming child, by at each embrace concen-
trating all his energies toward that objective, thereby charging
the vital fluids given to, and absorbed by, the mother-to-be;
helping her to build body, nerve and brain into the new creation.
When both man and woman understand this one secret of
Race REgeneration, the propagation of healthy, normal, natural
and God-like offspring will be much more certain. We venture
to say that ten wedded couples who truly love and have full
comprehension of the law, faithfully practicing its tenets, could
completely revolutionize this old world; their progeny would
be so positive, so virile and influential, as to enable them to

that he concentrates every force within his being, and if the
marital Rite is consummated at this time, he is, at the moment
of the climax, thoroughly positive in every department of his
little world.
If the woman granted his request after being thoroughly
awakened to desire through endearments, giving him her love,
and if he, during the entire embrace, especially at the moment of
highest bliss, concentrates his mind on the one object of calling
into existence a healthy, normal, and superior child, he is en-
abled to draw the potential forces from Heaven itself. This
longing, hurled into space, will become a part of the child to
be.
Re is enabled to still further influence the health, strength
and character of the coming child, by at each embrace concen-
trating all his energies toward that objective, thereby charging
the vital fluids given to, and absorbed by, the mother-to-be;
helping her to build body, nerve and brain into the new creation.
When both man and woman understand this one secret of
Race REgeneration, the propagation of healthy, normal, natural
and God-like offspring will be much more certain. We venture
to say that ten wedded couples who truly love and have full
comprehension of the law, faithfully practicing its tenets, could
completely revolutionize this old world; their progeny would
be so positive, so virile and influential, as to enable them to
beneficially rule the races.

diseased, because it is entirely possible that his father, or grand-
father, or even great-grandfather, may have been the sufferer
and the germs, transmitted from generation to generation, have
been dormant up to the time they became part of the new
creation.
While various diseases are usually inherited from the father,
mental conditions, especially insanity and neurotic tendencies,
are most frequently impressed or absorbed from the mother,
every state of her mind having a pronounced influence upon that
of the unborn; it therefore behooves her to be extremely care-
ful of her mental attitude while enceinte.
Another reason children most frequently favor the mother,
all other things being equal, is, that while procreation is a pass-
ing fancy or an accident on the part of the father, it absorbs
all life of the mother; her energies, thoughts and desires are
concentrated on the task before her; consequently she contin-
ually impresses her personality, with its likes and dislikes, upon
the creation being formed within her bosom.
When we leave the boundary of the physical and enter the
realms of the purely mental, we meet with apparently serious
contradictions relative to the Law of Heredity. For instance,
it is generally known that most of the sons of great men are
seldom an honor to their fathers; while those of financial
giants are hardly ever successful. At a first superficial glance
this would indicate a contradiction of the law; actually it is not.
A man may once have been a physical giant and, while the
possessor of such strength, could undoubtedly have fathered an
equally potent progeny. Gradually, through abuse or negli-
gence, he deteriorates into a weakling, yet remaining capable
of procreation. His offspring at this period would hardly be
comparable to those fathered in his former virile condition.

Recommendations: Conception should be planned; never
the result of an "accident" in the satisfaction of gross passions.
Prior thereto, both husband and wife, and especially the wife,
should consult the family physician for a thorough physical
check-up, including blood count, blood pressure, urinary analy-
sis and examination of the heart. If any defect is present, it
should first be corrected. If all is well, pregnancy may take
place.
Regular examinations after pregnancy are of value, but be-

is to be avoided. Perfect manhood and womanhood is not the

|S AT puberty, the temple doors of the creative being
are opened so that God's universe may be peopled,
so at Menopause are they closed and if all has been
well, Nature bespeaks the benediction: "As thou
has been faithful despite all thy suffering, now may
thou know the joys of life without the shadow of fear."
The period of a woman's fruitful years are varied. In some
instances menstruation may commence as early as the age of
nine or ten and continue until fifty. In others the lunar season
does not appear until the fifteenth or even the eighteenth year,
ceasing at thirty-five to thirty-eight.
Many conditions influence both the commencement and the
cessation. Heredity frequently governs, and the girl whose
mother changed from girlhood to womanhood after reaching
the age of fifteen, and from fertility into Menopause at thirty-
eight, may expect the same rule to govern in her life, although
this is not always true.
Women who have borne children do not usually enter the
menopause as early in life as those who have not. As a general
rule, the more children a woman has had, the later she may
expect the "Change of Life" to occur.
A fallacy which has been universally accepted as a truth, and
from which we hope to free suffering womanhood, is the race
belief that as a woman approaches the years when meno-
pause should occur, she will commence to suffer all the misery,
both physical and mental, that the flesh is heir to.

Nothing need be further from the truth; physical ailments
and mental morbidity are not generally necessary, and when
present, merely indicate either ignorance or an abnormal life.
At this period of life the creative organism does undergo a
change, the ovaries atrophying, reducing in size and ceasing to
function as previously. It is also generally believed that the
uterus, like the ovaries, will atrophy. No doubt this does oc-
cur in some instances, but it is entirely unnecessary. If the laws
governing woman's sexual life and activity are understood and
obeyed, women undergoing menopause may remain as youthful
in their desires and their capacity to exchange the full love
embrace with husbands as before the change, and one of the
chief causes of divorces at this period of life — in plain words,
the wife's frigidity and lack of response—will have been
removed.
During the period when menopause takes place the entire
nervous system must undergo a thorough re-adjustment. One
of the first symptoms of the approach of a normal change of
life is irregularity in menstruation. Sometimes the lunar flow
will be missed for several months. Then it may appear regu-
larly for some time; again ceasing for a shorter or longer pe-
riod. This continues until the process of reconstruction is com-
pleted.
Undoubtedly, even in the strongest women who have lived
in obedience with natural laws, the various changes require
greater strength than did the monthly periods of cleansing. Be-
cause of this, the food should be especially vitalizing and free
from congesting material, while the body should have less
active exercise and the mind longer hours of rest.
Teaching by illustration is by far the easiest method. We re-

the wife's frigidity and lack of response-wilt have been
removed.
During the period when menopause takes place the entire
nervous system must undergo a thorough re-adjustment. One
of the first symptoms of the approach of a normal change of
life is irregularity in menstruation. Sometimes the lunar flow
will be missed for several months. Then it may appear regu-
larly for some time; again ceasing for a shorter or longer pe-
riod. This continues until the process of reconstruction is com-
pleted.
Undoubtedly, even in the strongest women who have lived
in obedience with natural laws, the various changes require
greater strength than did the monthly periods of cleansing. Be-
cause of this, the food should be especially vitalizing and free
from congesting material, while the body should have less
active exercise and the mind longer hours of rest.
Teaching by illustration is by far the easiest method. We re-
call the case of an average woman who, during her youth, re-

ceived no instructions in the care of her physical organism; who
refused all oportunities for gaining this important knowledge.
She was the mother of several children, suffering severely when
giving birth to most of them, by reason of improper food,
worry, overwork and many other unnatural and unnecessary
factors.
This woman is now in her fourth year of the change. A day
or two before the commencement of the flow there is a disturb-
ance of the stomach, then a bilious headache so severe it be-
comes necessary for her to go to bed. This headache may con-
tinue twenty-four to forty-eight hours. During this time she is
practically unable to see, so great is her suffering.
Then the flow of an odorous fluid commences and continues
for possibly five or six days. The woman is irritable, at times
extremely nervous, and next to irrational. From present ap-
pearances the change will not be completed for another year or
two. Our experience indicates that, with slight variations, this
is the usual "hell of middle life" through which most women
pass.
We also have in mind an acquaintance, a woman who was
blessed with an enlightened mother by whom she was fully in-
structed during her girlhood years. This lady no longer believes
that she need be ashamed of any portion of her body, but feels
that she has a perfect right to be proud of it.
She has long since thrown into discard the age-old idea
that she is the plaything of her husband, with no right to refuse
his request, or indicate her desires; also the belief that when
she passes through the gates of the menopause she will no

eight, had neither a thought nor an indication of the approach-
ing crisis until the lunar flow ceased to appear. A day or two
after the period when menstruation should have commenced
she was aware of slightly hot flushes and a desire to rest.
Instead of giving way to worry, woman's usual companion,
she took a warm douche, a tepid bath with a quick rub, a hot
cup of tea and went to bed. In a few hours these flushes passed
and she felt wide-awake, though slightly nervous. In place of
asking for an opiate, she dressed and took a long walk, swing-
ing her arms and breathing deeply.
For the next few days she changed her diet to luscious fruits
and fresh green vegetables, such as lettuce, celery, corn, peas,
and plenty of milk and fresh eggs. During the time of what had
formerly been the lunar season she abstained from meats,
sweets, spices and stimulating drinks.
The next periodical flow appeared as usual, but she continued
the former treatment. After an intermittent appearance for
about a year, the flow ceased entirely and for six months past
there has been no indication of its ever again appearing.
During all of this period she never for a moment permitted
herself the thought that now she would be less a woman or
less desirable to her husband, but remained firm in the belief
that there should be no change in the conjugal relationship, and
acted accordingly. As a result, her husband was barely aware
of the change taking place. This is the natural way of the
change.
Cases vary even when an enlightened regime is faithfully
followed, but it is safe to say that every abnormal and un-
desirable symptom can be quickly overcome by rest, abstaining
from certain foods, taking proper exercises and a correct outlook
on life, and adopting such remedial agents as may be necessary.

Generally, the greatest enemies woman must contend with
during the menopause are indigestion, dyspepsia, sluggishness
of the liver, over-work, abnormal indulgence in food and
drink, unhygienic surroundings, etc. If these be removed and
normal habits of life established, there need be no reason for
worry.
It is a universally accepted delusion that with the cessation
of the periodic flow, woman naturally ceases to enjoy the em-
braces of her husband, and is no longer capable of conferring
upon him the former satisfaction, supposedly due to the atro-
phying of the ovaries, and shrinking of the vaginal walls. This
is a race belief which has been the cause of more misery, sor-
row, broken hearts and disrupted homes, than almost all other
combined influences.
This thought, always present in the mind of woman long be-
fore the time of the approaching change, has been a "thorn in
flesh." Many women look forward, with dire foreboding, to
the period when the fires-of-love—keen desire—will no longer
burn within her and she will become incapable of giving the
former pleasure to the man she loves, with the altogether
natural expectation that he will seek satisfaction elsewhere
than at his own fireside.
This constant fear and expectation unquestionably have
much to do with the unnatural and undesirable change taking
place, as well as with the gradual decline of the woman's
desire for the usual love embrace, so that by the time the
"change of life" is actually completed, her entire organism, no
less than her desires and capabilities, have become paralyzed
and she becomes frigid in her nature, totally at variance with
her former self.

As a matter of absolute—and saving—truth, we can assure
every woman living that there is no foundation for this de-
structive race belief. She may avoid becoming a victim of this
inertia. She can, if she will, become many times more capable
of both experiencing and giving affectional pleasure after the
menopause, than during any other period of her life, with the
possible exception of the first few times she permitted the em-
brace.
If a woman will keep the affectional fires burning while
passing through the change of life by willingly, and with
conscious desire, accepting the conjugal embrace at least once
a week between the lunar periods, being watchful that she
experiences the complete climax in its highest perfection each
time, she will not only keep the love nature alive and fully
awakened, but she will delay the atrophying process of the
ovaries and the shrinking of both uterus and the vaginal
walls; becoming thereby capable of giving more intense and
prolonged pleasure to her spouse than ever before, because the
constant fear of pregnancy will have been entirely removed.

incompetent; mental depression; a seeming dullness of
memory and the inability to concentrate as well as for-
merly, are usually more pronounced in men than in
women. Other common symptoms are: Lassitude and
inertia; a desire for inaction; palpitation of the heart;
asthma or other ailments heretofore unknown, and fears
of various kind, all without actual reason. Danger is
frequently sensed, though none is present. Men easily
become excited or worried without actual cause. Numb-

may be taut and "on edge" much of the time. There is
frequently a loss of interest in things formerly considered
essential to life and happiness—a sense of failure and inse-

even in trifling, inconsequential affairs. There may be a
lack of Libido, i.e., the former urge for sexual relationship.
In fact, this may become pronounced; more so in men

wish to remain competent and fulfill the role of true men

essing, may now be of an entirely different nature? Why all
this change?
It is as though a man had been sustained for many years to a
point near heaven by some force or power, other than his own,
and permitted, aye, even urged, to enjoy life to the full
without personal effort; and then, suddenly, being cut off, as
it were, in mid-air, with the stipulation: "If it be your desire
to enjoy what has been yours for so many years, your per-
sonal EFFORT MUST COMPENSATE FOR THAT WHICH WAS
freely given you UP 'till NOW. If you fail to make this
effort, and make it constantly, then all that has been yours
will be lost to you."
Nature is utterly selfish. She concerns herself solely
and wholly with her own interests. Beginning with adoles-
cence she sets into motion certain emotional longings and
desires which automatically create forces and energies that
must find activities and outlets in one form or another,
and the most "natural" is the biological urge—desire for
the exercise of the libido. This desire, almost incessant,
is an incentive not so much to create as to enjoy and satisfy
the urge. Nature is wise in this respect, because it assures
her continued creation of the species. In man, this is a
carnal urge which Nature instigates and keeps active so
long as it serves her. In woman the desire is aroused by
love's activity, or what she believes and accepts as such;
induced by petting, fondling and coaxing. Man is the
tempter; woman the tempted.
During this period effort, on the part of man, except in
the direction of self-control, is unnecessary. "Whatever
efforts he exerts are to hold his emotional urges in check,

But all things must come to an end. There comes a time
when Nature has obtained from man all she desires or all of
which he is capable. His days of virility over, Nature arranges
thus:
"Up to the present time I have given you all the power and
energy required to enjoy yourself to such degree that you have
been unable to resist the Urge within you. I, Nature, have been
the incentive of your acts. I have been your 'devil' of pleasure.
You, in turn, have been the tempter of your mate. Between
you, you have served me well. You are now no longer useful
to me; hence I sever my connection with you and yours. If
YOU DESIRE TO REMAIN A man, AND YOUR MATE A Woman,
then you must henceforth do for yourself that
which i have previously done for you."
Nature is cruel, but in her own way she is also
merciful to man though he is generally unaware
of it. Although she forsakes him at this critical
moment, she does not entirely leave him helpless,
he still has the opportunity, and the ability, to do
for himself everythingthat she had previously done
FOR HIM with the exception of the capability of procreation.
At this stage of life, what is man (this includes woman) to
do? Nature gave man his virility in order that he might enjoy
himself freely, and, as a result, procreate the race. God gave
man something far greater than that which Nature did—HIS
imagination. When the incentive of Nature is withdrawn,
the IMAGINATION must step in and TAKE ITS PLACE.

Both husband and wife should have a full understanding

This is most readily accomplished by retrospection—by

port, speed must be reduced, so that there may be a reserve of
power for all emergencies.

menopause has nothing whatever to do with such weakness
or suffering other than possibly furnishing an avenue for their
manifestation.
The change of life should never be an occasion for fear and
dread, but should rather be welcomed as an opportunity for
greater peace and contentment; a deeper mental, physical, spirit-
ual satisfaction. If harmony has been established in the system,
menopause will proceed normally and the body will enjoy
freedom from many of its former weaknesses.
One fact cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind
of every woman, namely: if afflicted with what is usually
termed "female weakness," she will suffer more or less during
the change unless corrective measures are taken, and should
hardly expect the change itself to be a cure-all, or the means of
freeing her from such ailments. In fact, the change of life may
even intensify the condition; establish chronic invalidism,
hysterical, nervous or irrational moments with the result that
life will be made miserable for her and all members of the
family.
Recommendation: Immediately after it becomes apparent
that the "change" is beginning or has commenced, a reliable
physician should be consulted; blood count checked; blood-
pressure taken; cardiograph and a urinalysis made.
Any abnormality should be corrected by proper treat-
ment. In many instances, the services of an experienced Endo-
crinologist will be of great aid in helping women to pass
through the change naturally and normally and with the least
inconvenience. Glandular (biological) substances long since
have proved their efficacy. These recommendations, be it re-
membered, are as important to men as they are to women.

that this practice may become so pronounced and do such
great harm to the animal, that it has become necessary for
breeders of valuable stock to use saltpetre to reduce the urge
of the animal and to arrange their stalls to make the practice
next to impossible
This is an ugly truth, but one which generally understood,
will compel many accepted authorities to seek in other than
the animal for knowledge upon which to base their theories
dealing with sex practices.
Practically all teachers of the subject who did not base
their conclusions on what they believe to be the laws and habits
governing the animal kingdom, relied rather on their misunder-
standing of Nature's laws, telling us that it is natural for
man to live the continent life while remaining single.
This inference is as erroneous as the first, because the law
governing throughout all the realms of creative nature is:
As soon as sentient creatures reach the age where reproduction
is possible they mate, cohabit regularly in the season, being gov-
erned exclusively by their instincts; and many, in fact, most
animals, are decidedly polygamic.
Nature does not question whether reproduction really results.
It is an actual fact that in numerous instances, especially
with finely bred animals, it is necessary to mate them time
after time before conception occurs.
Thus, throughout the domain of nature, instinct and season
alone is recognized. There is absolutely no governing code
of morality or honor, and the only law obeyed is: Use the
function and forces of reproduction just as soon as they are
sufficiently developed, and continue their exercise, whenever
possible, until age ends all.

This is the fiat of Nature and decidedly no more desirable
for humanity to obey than are the instincts governing animals
and inciting them to action. A comprehension and acceptance
of these facts will urge us to seek more deeply for a rule
of action which is applicable to mankind and in harmony with
God's great purpose.
What then is this Law?
Simply this: Man is dual in his nature. First, the animal
or creative instinct, the biological urge, governs his desires
and he generally obeys them. In fact, few ever gain the
knowledge and strength to wisely control the function. Possibly
this is well, otherwise creation might cease.
Second, the Divine inheritance; a consciousness giving man
the right of choice. Knowing and feeling the urge of his
human and animal nature, he possesses a mind with which he
can keep in check the desires of his lower nature.
Concisely stated, this implies that at the dictation of his
Divine nature, he exercises the creative, or animal function
only when his higher self indicates that it is best for him to
do so.
We say "best" advisedly, because the code of morality
changes from age to age. What is believed right in this day
may be considered totally wrong in the near future. This
is clearly indicated in the Biblical stories recording acts which
today would be pronounced as criminal, but at the time of their
consummation were blessed of God, because necessary to the
continuation of the race.
Neither the instinct which governs the action of animals,
nor the laws of Nature, as generally understood, are applicable

accountable being, possessing the privilege of free choice.
Within him are two entirely separate personalities, one gov-
erned by Natural Law and carnal desire; the other by the
Divine Prompting of God; maintaining throughout that this
Higher Law should govern his creative acts; permitting exer-
cise of the function only when to the best interest of humanity,
himself, and God's great purpose.
Almost from the moment of birth there is an urge in the
creature, whether animal or human, to exercise the creative
function. As days pass into weeks, weeks into months, months
into years, this incitant, with the awakening desire, continues
to increase in intensity until die time of adolescence, when
the craving for indulgence is well nigh uncontrollable.
This is comprehensible when we are aware that only because
of this constant urge is the world populated. Were it not
for this uncontrolled longing, the knowledge of pain follow-
ing the birth of a new creature, and the grave responsibility
involved, would induce practically all in the feminine world
to refuse the union which results in a new creation. The con-
stant urge and desire to exercise the creative function, is, as
we have said, Nature's law for her own protection—a law
that still governs the majority of mankind.
No effort is required on the part of anyone, except physical
weaklings, to have this inherent craving for sexual indulgence
increase with the bodily growth. It is Mother Nature herself
acting within the bosom of the creature, so that it shall

possibilities; the inculcation of a thorough understanding of
the purpose of the creative organism and the correct exercise
of the function for three specific purposes, namely: reproduc-
tion; RE-creation, or the reconstruction of the self being, and
^-generation.
Merely teaching the youths these laws would not be any
more desirable than locking the safety valve in a steam engine
to prevent the escape of steam when the pressure became
greater than the power of resistance of the boiler. If under-
standing and protection is sought, there must be a thorough
knowledge of the power and use of the forces, as well as a
natural and divinely accepted method for the use, reabsorption,
or transmutation of the superfluous energy.
We are aware that the man or woman who is given to
extremely hard physical labor, to worry, anxiety, intense study,
or exercise and training requiring great nerve and muscular
force, is, for the time being, practically free from the libido
or urge of the procreative nature. This clearly indicates a
method whereby the functions may be controlled without
detrimental effects on the being.
First: A careful selection of food, including in the dietary
only those articles which contain the maximum amount of
nerve, brain and rebuilding material, and the minimum of
stimulating, irritating and congesting substances; a wise selec-
tion of drinks, avoiding those stimulating and exciting, such
as tea and coffee; all alcoholic beverages and so-called "soft"
drinks, these latter actually causing an irritation of the kidneys,
having a direct exciting action on the sexual organism, often
more destructive than beer or light wine, and in many respects
equally as harmful as other alcoholic drinks.

possibilities; the inculcation of a thorough understanding of
the purpose of the creative organism and the correct exercise
of the function for three specific purposes, namely: reproduc-
tion; RE-creation, or the reconstruction of the self being, and
RE-generation.
Merely teaching the youths these laws would not be any
more desirable than locking the safety valve in a steam engine
to prevent the escape of steam when the pressure became
greater than the power of resistance of the boiler. If under-
standing and protection is sought, there must be a thorough
knowledge of the power and use of the forces, as well as a
natural and divinely accepted method for the use, reabsorption,
or transmutation of the superfluous energy.
We are aware that the man or woman who is given to
extremely hard physical labor, to worry, anxiety, intense study,
or exercise and training requiring great nerve and muscular
force, is, for the time being, practically free from the libido
or urge of the procreative nature. This clearly indicates a
method whereby the functions may be controlled without
detrimental effectS on the being.
First: A careful selection of food, including in the dietary
only those articles which contain the maximum amount of
nerve, brain and rebuilding material, and the minimum of
stimulating, irritating and congesting substances; a wise selec-
tion of drinks, avoiding those stimulating and exciting, such
as tea and coffee; all alcoholic beverages and so-called "soft"
drinks, these latter actually causing an irritation of the kidneys,
having a direct exciting action on the sexual organism, often
more destructive than beer or light wine, and in many respectS
equally as harmful as other alcoholic drinks.

Second: Frequent bathing to cleanse the system of all con-
gestions; keeping the pores of the skin free from poisonous
substances, and helping it to perform its functions by absorb-
ing plenty of fresh air.
Third: Careful selection of wearing apparel, choosing the
clothing for comfort as well as appearance; not too tight;
porous, thus allowing fresh air to reach the skin. Wearing
woolen clothing next to the skin is highly undesirable except
in the aged—those who have reached senility. The universal
practice of having children and youths wear woolen underwear
cannot be too severely condemned.
Fourth: Exercise is of vast importance. Proper exercise
not only develops the body, nerves, and muscles, exhilarating
the mind; it also forces the circulation to "draw up" much
of the vital fluids which promote growth; giving incentive
to the mind and strengthening the character; thereby greatly
lessening or neutralizing the desire for sexual gratification.
Fifth: Association. Possibly nothing else with the exception
of food, has such a vast influence on the desires as have associ-
ates. Whenever possible, these should be selected from youths
of like ages, known to be of clean habits and chaste language;
also of people much older, capable of instilling moral courage,
worthy incentives and a longing for achievement. The clean-
est mind and purest heart can quickly be poisoned by continu-
ally listening to suggestive word picturing.
Sixth: Recreation. This is essential to the well-being of
every boy and girl and should include games, dramas, motion
pictures and dancing. All games requiring muscular activity
and nerve tensioning will help to naturally use up the stored
creative energy and, at the same time, elevate the mind, lifting
the thoughts from the physical to the mental and spiritual.

these desirable conditions, and finally, the REgeneration of

earth have read the Bible with a desire to learn the
truth, and honestly or hypocritically call themselves
"Christians"? How many have carefully studied
the very important books of Moses, in which he so
emphatically commands man to avoid "casting his seed upon
the ground"? How many of those who have read the Sacred
Scriptures — so-called because they teach the law — have ac-
tually obeyed these Laws in act and spirit?
It is safe to say that this Divine fiat has been more or less
impressed upon the men who have been sincere in their search
and study. However, only a comparatively few really compre-
hend that in this edict is contained the law of life and death
to man as an individual, and to the race in general.
Disobedience to this one command in the "garden" (the
beginning of conscious man) has been the cause of wars and
rumors of war, sin and sickness, misery and finally death; in

the Law of Life or death—depending on whether it is obeyed
'The act or acts discussed in this Chapter constitutes what is in reality the

perience instead of the proverbial "daily grind."
"The Soul that sinneth, it shall die."—Ezek. 18: 4, 20, is
an eternal, irrevocable law, and is directly applicable to man's
almost universal practice of giving his "seed unto Moloch";
—Lev. 20: 2, i.e., the "casting of the seed upon the ground"
in one manner or another because this is the wasting, i.e.,
unholy destruction, of the universal, creative substance out of
which man is created and is the supply material for the "temples
not made with hands" which alone can "house" Souls. It is
the universal substance, God-given to man for both procreation
or generation and for his spiritual RE-generation.
In the ultimate it is immaterial by what specific act or acts
man casts his seed upon the ground; whether he be married
and living a form of prostitution with his legalized wife,
committing some form of pollution, masturbation, Coitus
Interruptus or any other Biblically condemned practice.
The ultimate result will almost invariably be the same, with
but slight variations, except that possibly one type of behavior
is more "beastly" than the other—with apologies to the beasts
of the field.
Sodomism and other perversions are admittedly more degrad-
ing, even in thought and desire, than the unsanctioned, i.e.,
UNSANCTified, acts engaged in by men and women during the
marital rite.
Of all the unnatural practices in married life, pollution as
the result of non-completion of the rite, or, as in Biblical
language, "casting the seed upon the ground,"—to Moloch—
is probably the most disgusting and Soul degrading, while the
immediately harmful effect is in Coitus Interruptus.

Consulting any modern medical text on the subject—and
many are published especially for the laity—it quickly becomes
apparent that Coitus is possible only as a result of the blood
rushing into the male organ of generation. The male in turn
brings about the same result in the female by coddling,
endearments, etc.
In normal, natural Coitus the desire of both, and movements
in harmony with the desire, will bring about a climax or
sensation, resulting in immediate release, followed by the
relaxation of the entire system, especially the nervous system,
with a normalization of the blood circulation.
If the marital embrace is all it should be, mentally, physi-
cally and spiritually, then there will follow a feeling of general
well-being; a let-down as it were, with a desire for rest.
However, if the Rite is engaged in, both parties brought to

organism could bear no more, and then the act is left unfinished
(Coitus Interruptus), the parties separating, there will be no
immediate let-down, no relaxation of the nervous system, but,
on the contrary, an intensification of excitement and the blood
will not at once recede; leaving the organism calm and satisfied.
If this practice is repeated time and again, it will result in
ovarian congestion and inflammation, causing various dis-
eases of the woman's generative system, shattered nerves on
her part, and Prostatitis on his part, ending finally in
some form of surgical operation for both. Uncountable
such operations each year are traceable directly to this
vicious practice.

If this practice is repeated time and again, it will result in
ovarian congestion and inflammation, causing various dis-

Prostatitis, eighty per cent of what are generally classed

In addition to the damage to the physical well-being,

may be satisfied. For a moment's pleasure a terrific price is
paid in moral weakness, physical suffering and mental
degradation.

and to give pleasure, we are constantly seeking the ideal and
longing for an understanding of the laws leading to spiritual
consciousness. Of all this the primitive man was wholly igno-
rant; therefore it is illogical to analyze the creative impulses

Unquestionably, there was much in the primitive man that
moderns could well accept as examples after which to pattern
their own lives. The primitive man was well satisfied with the
association of one woman, and because of this, his creative or-

present time when men indulge promiscuously, absorbing the
mixed magnetic forces of numerous women.
This is always destructive to both health and stability of
mind. When, to satisfy the passions, men or women indulge
in Coitus with different persons within a limited time, the blood
becomes a mixture of different forces.
This creates a consuming fire in the blood, a constantly in-
creasing desire for more frequent indulgence, creating an irri-

The great mass of men have not yet become acquainted with
the absolute law, that man has not the slightest right, even
though married, to embrace the woman unless he is actuated
by love. To seek the embrace when passion and desire, minus
love, is the incentive, is to commit an unholy act. It is prosti-

On the contrary, the abuse of the function is the cause, now

considered as frigid, or actually almost dormant in feeling, may

to her, until finally she is willing to lead an immoral life with-
out compulsion.
Where is there any actual difference between the woman of
"ill fame" who sells her body, and the husbanded lady, who,
for one reason or another, permits favors revolting to her na-
ture, while possibly hating or bearing malice toward her hus-
band? Not alone does the woman suffer, but he, also, is severely
punished; the incentive may be different; the ultimate results
are identical.
We have frequently said that women, especially those mar-
ried, have become slaves to the passions of their husbands.
What of the numberless instances where husbands truly love
their wives, obeying the laws in their entirety, never approach-
ing them except with caresses and consent, but who, time and

Perversions
ex perversion, whatever its peculiar variation or
manifestation, appears to be in itself a perversion.
It is like a dream within a dream. One of the many
avenues created for the satisfaction of abnormal de-
sire is the white slave traffic. This is organized be-
cause of the demand for women to be exploited for generally
accepted immoral purposes. Young and innocent girls are often
desired by men rich in worldly goods. These have usually be-
come so thoroughly satiated with the more common abuses of
the creative function that they continually seek for satisfaction
in ways out of the ordinary, and they possess the means to have
this want supplied.
This is only one of the many reasons for the exploitation of
God's greatest gift to humanity. It usually leads to degradation
first and spiritual destruction in the end. It would probably
take a large volume to separate and classify all of the reasons.
Among the specific reasons are some not at all due to degen-
eracy, but to the biological urge on the one side, and ignorance
on the other.
First among these are the countless single men of all ages
who are well sexed with a strong Libido, who have never had
instructions for its control, or how they might make construc-
tive, and even Immortalizing or REgenerative use of the crea-
tive forces by wisely and correctly directing them.
These have no thought of committing DEgenerative acts.

Another large number of those patronizing houses of ill
repute are as innocent in intent as the class just named. These
are found among that almost uncountable number of men who

whose wives are naturally frigid. That the wives of such men,
or many of them, are utterly selfish, self-satisfied, or perhaps
were victims of the husband's ignorance at the beginning of
married life, is beside the point. The fact remains that they
have sealed up both affection and desire within themselves and
refuse to comply with their husband's wishes, except occasion-
ally under what amounts to compulsion. In such instances both
husbands and wives are in a manner innocent of evil intent,
but their unnatural way of living invariably ends in the bro-
thel or solitary vice; in degradation; dissatisfaction, or possibly
grave diseases, both mental and physical.
If a count could be taken, it would probably be found that
these two classes mentioned—without intent of any specific
wrong—outnumber all others in their support of houses of ill-
repute, except during periods of war.
How to remedy this destructive, demoralizing and degener-
ating condition is the great problem confronting mankind.
This problem must be solved and the remedy applied if the

away the very heart of the people. In the past it has been the
main cause of the downfall of great nations. Virility of man
alone makes great nations possible, and virility and manhood
are surely destroyed by perversive practices.
In seeking for the cause of debasing practices and the re-
sulting degeneracy, are we willing to accept the revealing truth
when we are confronted with it?
If we are, we will soon learn that, generally, the parents
whose sons and daughters follow the left-handed path have
themselves been deeply guilty, though all too often ignorantly
so, of constantly and consistently infringing upon creative
laws. Possibly the child was undesired, hence cursed in thought
and feeling throughout the days of the mother's pregnancy.
Possibly the mother was frigid or unaroused by affection and
the marital rite was repugnant to her when conception took
place. There are in truth and fact hundreds of "perhapses" in-
volved.
Admittedly, it is not always the fault of one or both of the
parents that the child becomes a pervert, but there is always a
cause. Exceptions only prove the rule and even in the isolated
cases it will be found that, like in the inheritance of syphilis
or other inheritable diseases, the tendency may be handed down
from grandparents or great grandparents.
The one and only remedy that will dispel the ignorance
pervading humanity relative to the creative function and
everything that is associated with it, consists in the con-
stant explanation of the purpose of sex, the sacredness
of sex, and the observance of the creative laws as laid
down by Sacred literature, i.e., as a religious duty essen-
tial to the salvation of man's Soul.

to forsake all that is real in life for an apparently glittering fu-
ture.
Instinctively, these girls, though of good heart, are dissatis-

community affords. They look with longing eyes to those other
possessions and pleasures of which so much has been written.

note the dissatisfaction and seeks acquaintance; he plays upon

of these girls is honest at heart, but all scruples are readily over-

marriage.
We have indicated several reasons why it is apparently easy
for the exploiters of virtue to find victims; because of the dis-

Whether it is the fault of one or the other, or both, the fact
cannot be denied or contradicted that the marriage rite is des-

selfish purposes. Where there is a lack of love or affection it
is prostitution, even if the indulging pair are legally wedded,
and all too frequently the results are unwanted children.
These are unfortunately born; not having been conceived in
love—holiness—consequently without an inborn love for the
pure and good; naturally dissatisfied and more often than not,
with an insatiable longing for all that is unattainable in the

There is no Soul, or 'spiritual desire in the heart for the real,

be saved, only Divine use, (through, and in love) may be made
of the creative function, and that to "cast the seed to Mol-

damn the body, mind, and finally, the Soul itself.
Every boy and girl able to read will find in any daily paper
more degrading information in the scandals paraded before the
public than could possibly be contained in the entire exposition
of sex and its laws, when clothed in sane and chaste language.
We constantly permit our children to read scandal monger-
ing sheets, while persistently refusing to enlighten them re-

struction in the correct knowledge that they may know how to
preserve their honor and purity and guard themselves against
the pitfalls and snares, disease, sorrow and misery resulting
from the abuse of these functions.
Surely, we must admit that it is far more desirable and noble
to teach the prevention of wrong than to punish our children
for the immorality of which they may become guilty and from
which we might have saved them.
Who are those sitting in judgment, issuing edicts that we
shall not teach the saving truth? With rare exception they are
those who themselves abused their procreative functions to an
extent resulting in incompetence; consequently their action is
governed by their knowledge of the dark, disgusting, degrad-
ing aspect, and by their total ignorance of the elevating,
reconstructive, regenerating feature.
Another class ready to taboo the entire subject are those of
cold, frigid, forbidding temperament, who cannot see aught
but wrong in the nature that is warm, sensitive, loving, normal,
therefore passionate, as the great Creator intended.

Surely, we must admit that it is far more desirable and noble
to teach the prevention of wrong than to punish our children
for the immorality of which they may become guilty and from
which we might have saved them.
Who are those sitting in judgment, issuing edicts that we
shall not teach the saving truth? With rare exception they are
those who themselves abused their procreative functions to an
extent resulting in incompetence; consequently their action is
governed by their knowledge of the dark, disgusting, degrad-
ing aspect, and by their total ignorance of the elevating,
reconstructive, regenerating feature.
Another class ready to taboo the entire subject are those of
cold, frigid, forbidding temperament, who cannot see aught
but wrong in the nature that is warm, sensitive, loving, normal,
therefore passionate, as the great Creator intended.

Facing fairly without evasion this important question, one
must admit that the followers of sex-continence almost uni-
versally exemplify unfortunate traits and most undesirable
weaknesses.1
All too many people, otherwise intelligent, sincerely be-
lieve and argue that as animals co-habit only for the perpetu-
ation of their species, men, also, should be satisfied by imitating
the creatures of the woods and fields and depend upon evolu-
tionary activity alone for their development.
We could as sensibly argue that the instincts and propen-
sities of the horse or cow, or even the swine, should serve man
as an example to the spiritually awakened, as to compare the
demands and requirements of the animal nature or plant life
to those of the spiritually awakened and developing human
beings.
Nature has perfectly adjusted the requirements of animal
and plant kingdoms to the laws of those realms. The line of
demarcation between man and beast is distinctly drawn and
an equal distinction exists in the laws governing them. Men
are supposed to live in harmony with God, which includes
all other harmonies. Animals and plants live in conformity
with the purpose of nature; whose one and only great incentive
is the reproduction of their species; resultantly, the exercise of
the creative function takes place only when this is possible.
Dominated by the law of her being, the female animal con-
sents, and conception occurs only while she is in season.
When the lunar period is past, she refuses all advances of
the male, fighting if need be, to free herself of these attentions.
1 We have in mind only the modern self-styled philosophical and religious-
spiritual organizations who teach continence to their fellows and either practice
the contrary or prove guilty of the worst forms of sex debasement.

This attitude is in conformity with the laws governing animals
and in no way applies to higher beings.
Possessing only the lower nature, the animal has no possi-
bility of re-generation, consequently, there is neither call nor
reason for sex activity, except for reproduction.
Human beings are governed by an entirely different law.
Woman does not conceive during the lunar season, but just
before or shortly after. We do not say that conception would
not take place during that period, or that it cannot, but we
maintain it should not.
To conceive during this period is a crime against the Creator
of the sexes, against the woman who consents or suffers it to
occur, and against the child to be born under such a condition.
The result of conception during the lunar season is always
undesirable; an instance of this is the Biblical story of Jacob
and Esau.
There is as much difference in the law governing the dem-
onstration of sex, between the human and the animal, as there
is in the matter of clothing or covering, or in the kind and
preparation of food. It is not only irrational, but criminal as
well, to exalt the animal kingdom as an example for the human.
There are as many reasons against the practice of continence,
as there are tones in the musical scale. We state here the
most obvious, physical one. It is immaterial what the man's
work may be, whether fatiguing bodily labor or nerve-ex-
hausting study, or how gross or spiritual his employment or
vocation, how little he thinks or how philosophically; the body
is a laboratory continuously refining the seminal fluid and
storing it for use. Sooner or later this fluid, which could more
correctly be termed an "elixir," must be used or disposed of.

We employ the words "used" and "disposed" advisedly.
They express our exact meaning. Take the highest form of
life which man is capable of living; the man of superior
wisdom; one with a divine understanding of the laws of God,
and who, through this knowledge, knows how to use the sem-
inal fluid for the REgeneration of the self, his body. Even in
his case, there will be a surplus, and if this is not absorbed
in a natural manner, it must eliminated from the system, by
the urine, nocturnal emission, or otherwise.
If allowed to remain in the body unabsorbed, it becomes
stagnant and therefore poisonous to the system; what is more
and worse, it has a destructive effect on the cellular tissue of
the brain, and the powers of Will and discrimination are ad-
versely influenced.
This often results in perversion and ends in self-degradation.
Physical and mental health demands that the seminal fluids
not used for creative purposes should be turned into other

RACE REGENERAnON 165
We employ the words "used" and "disposed" advisedly.
They express our exact meaning. Take the highest form of
life which man is capable of living; the man of superior
wisdom; one with a divine understanding of the laws of God,
and who, through this knowledge, knows how to use the sem-
inal fluid for the REgeneration of the self, his body. Even in
his case, there will be a surplus, and if this is not absorbed
in a natural manner, it must eliminated from the system, by
the urine, nocturnal emission, or otherwise.
If allowed to remain in the body unabsorbed, it becomes
stagnant and therefore poisonous to the system; what is more
and worse, it has a destructive effect on the cellular tissue of
the brain, and the powers of Will and discrimination are ad·
versely influenced.
This often results in perversion and ends in self-degradation.
Physical and mental health demands that the seminal fluids
not used for creative purposes should be turned into other
channels-that of REgeneration and in renewing life and
strength.
The higher the understanding a man has of the possibilities,
potentialities and destinies of the human race, the loftier will
be his conception of the powers, forces and possibilities of the
individual.
Conclusions are based on a true foundation when man admits
that he was created with a powerful sex nature to be used in
wise and holy activities. To limit that application or direction by
confining its action to the purpose of reproduction alone is un-
natural to his dual-human and spiritual-nature, and fre-
quently leads to degeneracy.
The laws of God and nature do not limit man except to
confine him within the bounds of natural and spiritual laws.

The seminal fluid is created abundantly by the system, and
though a man were to live more or less a polygamous life,
and in addition, use up all that was necessary in the recreation
and renewing of his own body, the secretions would exceed
his requirements.
There are many, most of them spiritually debased by their
own secret practices, who loudly deplore the "commonness"
of the sex impulse and emphasize the sordid physical side;
claiming they are repulsed by it and that at best it is to be
exercised only for cohabitation.
Thus do they try to besmirch one of God's greatest blessings
—the means of both generation and REgeneration—and turn
it into a curse or a calamity.
These are the same people, usually, who are "too nice" to
admit to their children that child-birth is both natural and

their duty, they weaken gradually, tubercular indications appear
and death is merely a question of time.
The law governing is identical in every part of the elimina-
tive system. All these organs receive a share of the nutriment
from the food ingested. It is apportioned to them according

of their particular organism.
All that is not used in construction and reconstruction is
refuse and must be eliminated, otherwise it will deteriorate,

we repeat no. If he is not an all-around man he is not in
possession of the prerogatives of man.
Follow this question to the ultimate. Is it possible for him
to truly love God? The answer is the likewise emphatic "no."
To truly love is to love wholly (holy), with all of one's nature
as a unit.
The diseased or subnormal man is not whole; half of his
emotional nature is weak or neurotic, and half a man cannot
give a whole man's love to either woman or God.
All the famous men and women who have become great
in the world of action and accomplishment were those possess-
ing fully developed, normal sex natures. Proven celibates and
eunuchs are not listed among the Immortals. If there was
ever any misuse of the sex function by famous men and women
it was on the side of super-activity, never non-use.
It is utterly impossible for a man to be healthy, virile and
strong, capable of physical and mental activity along any line
of the world's work, who does not attend to the organs of
elimination in his own body. Neither is it possible for a man
to be healthy in body and mind, full of strength and vivacity,
who does not live a natural life. The man who is love-starved,
system-congested, mind-poisoned has little chance of success
or happiness.
The so-called doctrine of continence may be likened to a
pool of water surrounded by a wall of masonry. The fresh
water pours into the basin which, when filled, automatically
shuts off the inflow. From that time on, only an amount of
water equal to the quantity soaking away or evaporating finds
its way into the pool. What is the result? A child could guess
the answer. Stagnation.

The life and the purity of the water depends upon an outlet,
or outflow of the water already in the pool, and an inflow of
fresh water—on circulation and aeriation. If this is interfered
with, the stagnation generates poisons and each particle seeking
its affinity, rises to the top of the pool, unites itself with virulent
matter already there and forms a poisonous film over the body
of water.
As the pool of water requires an inflow of fresh water to
keep it pure and wholesome, so does the creative organism of
man need a constant inflow of the vital fluids. This presupposes
an outlet or outflow. This outlet denied, nature seizes other
means of protecting her interests. Continence is a deliberate
closing of the outlet, consequently there is room for only an
infinitesmal amount of the fresh vital fluids, the organism
already being congested.
The result is stagnation of the seminal fluids in the creative
organism. Stagnation always is creative of poisons. Poison
created or generated in the congested area, finds its way into
the circulation, affecting all the tissues of the body.
This is ultimately followed by a disturbed equilibrium affect-
ing the entire system of man; undermining his moral nature,
deadening his spiritual conscience; weakening the Will; and, as
a result of irritation, giving impetus to increased desire. The
natural, normal outlet being closed, creative nature turns upon
the one guilty.
Perversions of many kinds and a thousand evils come into
existence under self-imposed, reasonless continence. The men-
tality gradually weakens, the Will loses its power and man
becomes a helpless victim of himself—all under the delusion
that he is treading the path to spirituality.

RACE REGENERATION 173
The life and the purity of the water depends upon an outlet,
or outflow of the water already in the pool, and an inflow of
fresh water-on circulation and aeriation. 1£ this is interfered
with, the stagnation generates poisons and each particle seeking
its affinity, rises to the top of the pool, unites itself with virulent
matter already there and forms a poisonous film over the body
of water.
As the pool of water requires an inflow of fresh water to
keep it pure and wholesome, so does the creative organism of
man need a constant inflow of the vital fluids. This presupposes
an outlet or outflow. This outlet denied, nature seizes other
means of protecting her interests. Continence is a deliberate
closing of the oudet, consequently there is room for only an
infinitesmal amount of the fresh vital fluids, the organism
already being congested.
The result is stagnation of the seminal fluids in the creative
organism. Stagnation always is creative of poisons. Poison
created or generated in the congested area, finds its way into
the circulation, affecting all the tissues of the body.
This is ultimately followed by a disturbed equilibrium affect-
ing the entire system of man; undermining his moral nature,
deadening his spiritual conscience; weakening the Will; and, as
a result of irritation, giving impetus to increased desire. The
natural, normal outlet being closed, creative nature turns upon
the one guilty.
Perversions of many kinds and a thousand evils come into
existence under self-imposed, reasonless continence. The men·
tality gradually weakens, the Will loses its power and man
becomes a helpless victim of himself-all under the delusion
that he is treading the path to spirituality.

An Individual Problem
j he problem of sex, like that of dietetics, is an individual
one. Men differ from one another in their require-
ments. While different foods are necessary for dif-
ferent types of people, the general laws governing
nutrition apply to the race as a whole. It is the
same with the laws governing the creative function. These
also have a general application; but the individual activity
must be in harmony with the haw.
Some men store up an immense reserve of vital force. Even
though more than the normal amount of vitality is expended
in business and life in general, there is still a surplus that must
be directed along other avenues. The most important outlet
is by means of the marital rite in exchange for other forces
so essential to mental and physical well-being. The unmarried
naturally require a different method.
That Race REgeneration may be made certain, the laws of
both God and nature, as they concern man's advancement
physically, mentally and spiritually, must be fully under-
stood and obeyed. Preconceived ideas must be exchanged for
actual knowledge. Truth alone is acceptable as a guide.
This enigma of sex is one of the most important of all of
man's problems, both individually and nationally, aye, univers-

Beginning with adolescence and continuing until Menopause,
the creative laboratory (of the "seed" or spermatozoon) is

or manufactured by this great laboratory is used not alone for
the creation of new beings, as so many believe, or in exchange
with the mate during the marital rite for the physical, mental
and spiritual being, but also for the rebuilding of the self;
the "seed" germs or spermatozoon often present in the marrow

discontinues functioning at the end of youth), and if man
refuses to keep the seminal fluid or vital forces in circulation,
a form of stagnation sets in which acts adversely upon the

it is essential that man's reproductive organism be kept active

Why are animal and human inclinations radically and
fundamentally different? Why is coition during the lunar
period sought by the animal female, and absolutely repugnant
to the human female?
As already noted, the female animal desires cohabitation
during the season of reproduction; the male is attracted to her,
and sought out by her, at this special time.
It is radically different with the woman, the opposite in
every respect; unclean during this period, the time of the
menstrual flow, she is passive; normally the idea of embrace
repulses her; if caresses awaken her desires she yet refuses all
advances, unless she has become one of the rapidly increasing
number of perverts. Should she desire conjugal exercise and
should she conceive during the time of her uncleanliness, the
result is a child marked in one way or another.
Unlike the animal, except in extraordinary cases, the woman
exhibits affection and desire after, not during, her hours of
abstinence. As a general rule, if she conceives shortly after
this period, a strong child should be the result; and it may be
stated in passing, that the greater the passion—love being one
of the aspects of her desire—the stronger and more virile will
be the offspring.
The possibility of conception decreases with the passing of
the days following the moon's phase. After ten days there
is a constantly lessening possibility of pregnancy; and it is not
likely that she will be able to conceive until a day or so before
the actual commencement of the next period.

There are, as a general rule, a certain number of days each
month during which most women are incapable of conceiving,

may, during this period, greatly desire the conjugal embrace.
If the laws of the animal world were given for the guidance

If continence is a sound doctrine, why should the female

other is an incitant to disease, morbidness, perversion (quite
often), and the destruction of all that is good, ending usually
in an ignoble death.
The sensual desire should be controlled in the same manner
as should all other appetites. A wise man eats only sufficiently
to supply the requirements of the physical being. Too much
food congests the entire system, producing the very opposite
of the effect desired. The exercise of the creative function
must be only to the degree conducive to health and vitality;
a normal satisfaction always resulting in peace and content-

Ignorance of the requirements of different temperaments is
productive of sin and suffering. The mating of natures is
quite as important a problem as the mating of bodies.
For example: A man of vital temperament, full of virility
and force, ought never to marry a woman of a cold, unimagina-
tive, phlegmatic nature. Such a union will make of existence
a hell for both, and the children of the union are certain to
be deficient mentally, and frequently afflicted with some physi-
cal weakness.
Careful selection of a fitting mate is of prime importance;
race development depends upon right selection. A normal
child can be expected only when pleasure, peace of mind and
complete satisfaction attend the marriage rite and that is im-
possible where the twain are improperly mated.

As abnormal children often result through the mating of

Only a week before the foregoing paragraph was written,
a woman, one whom we had cared for during a severe nervous
affliction, now the mother of two children, and enceinte with
the third, confessed to us that her severe attacks of nervous
irritation, amounting to irrational action, were the direct result
of a continuous desire for the embrace; this being granted her
possibly once a week, or every two weeks, then only at her
own request. What will be the result of such a conception?
Has any man the right to become a father, who cannot, or
will not (as in this case), righteously support the mother-to-be.
The teaching of, and obedience to, the doctrine of conti-

such delusive instructions the very things we wish to regulate,

Continence is, in itself, a form of perversion; only in the
rarest instances can a man begin living the continent life with-
out showing signs of weakness, nervousness, and, were he to

or destroy a normal tendency, we merely hold it in check for
a limited time until a change has taken place in its activity
and then, in some disguise, it manifests in a new sphere.
There is nothing higher on the physical plane than the
normal; if it changes its material form, shape, or design, it
becomes abnormal. Consequently, if a normal sex power is
suppressed it becomes unnatural, the first step on the path to
perversion.
Men, practicing continence, have been heard to justify their
action by voicing the sentiment that if all men were like them,
the red light districts in towns and cities would soon be extinct.
This is seemingly true; but hides an untruth. It is not the
men of normal sex practices that give life and support to vice,
but those guilty of attempting to suppress normal desire, and
those in an environment of life where normal action is denied
them.
Thousands of men are starved in their love-expression be-
cause of the ignorance of their wives. These women have
been taught that sex is degrading; that to acknowledge passion
in themselves is a shameful admission. They discourage the
sacred relationship, and the husbands, if normal, seek relief
and understanding elsewhere—usually among the undesirables
of the city's population, because they have too much respect
and manhood to approach a girl or woman to whom they
cannot offer honorable marriage in exchange for the favor.
Such women destroy their own love-nature and change what

CONTINENCE
The Duality in Human Behavior
E have already said that duality is the Law of existense.
It is a constant swing of the pendulum from the ex-
treme right to the extreme left; from the extreme
left to the extreme right. Without this dual activity
there would be quiescence; stagnation, death. The
extreme of continence is met by the opposite extreme; debauch-
ery and libertinism; one as destructive as the other. Only
between these two opposites can we find rationalism, naturalism
and finally, divinity.
The debauchee and the libertine consider life worth living
only in the practice of sensual excesses; only variety and pro-
miscuity appeal to them. Like the gourmand who lives only to
eat, these human beings are governed by carnality. They exist
only for the enjoyment of the sensual life; they are slaves
to a depraved appetite; the result of irritation and inflamma-
tion of the creative organism.
Those who preach and actually practice continence starve
their entire being; body, mind and the spiritual self, because
they refuse to supply their organism with the vital magnetism
obtainable only through a proper exchange, and by suppression
of a natural function they bring about stagnation. Those
guilty of various excesses not only shock the system continually
with the streams of magnetic forces from many sources, but
they also counter-shock the nervous system by the different
rates of vibration.

Thus they bring about irritations in the creative organism,
much after the manner produced by congestion resulting from
the practice of continence, and this in turn develops prosta-
titis and all the attendant ailments.
It is frequently questioned whether continence is as harm-
ful to woman as it is to man and in what manner its injurious
effects appear.
The basis of sex desire is widely different between the male
and the female, and the results of gratification differ. Generally
the desire for Coitus in a woman has its incentive in an entirely
different emotion than that of man. In him it arises from a
desire to indulge solely for pleasure's sake.
This is seldom the basis of a woman's desire. With her
the act is based more on the desire to give pleasure to the
loved one than her own desire for satisfaction. Woman's love
or affectional nature is finer, purer and less self-interested than
man's and involves different emotions.
When we say that desire for indulgence is based on pleasure
or self-satisfaction, we must not forget that in health and under
normal conditions there is an inner, unconscious urge and need
for physical relief on his part, and a nervous, emotional relaxa-
tion on her part. This is an additional call of nature for the
exchange of the spirit in the vital forces; this last being most
important to health and physical well being.
The difference between the sexes is both physical and emo-
tional. Physically, in the male there are glands which form a
reservoir for the storing of highly vitalized fluids, the fluids
which not only contain the "seed" for new creations, but also
act as an excitant toward exercise of the function.

comes an irritant if it is not taken into the blood circulation
for the rebuilding and revitalization of the system, or exchanged
during the marital embrace.
The woman possesses no such glands. She does not secrete
vital fluids of this nature, but we must not overlook the fact
that the vaginal glands secrete a vitalized or magnetic fluid
in the lochia.
This is not an excitant, but becomes an irritant if the love
and affectional nature is not satisfied as required by nature.
These physical differences are evidence that desire in woman
is not based on the storing of the fluid acting as an excitant,
but, as stated, on a nervous excitement called into action through
the nearness and caresses of the male. Because of the lack of
glands storing a vital essence, continence is not as harmful
to the woman as it is to man; nevertheless, a woman practicing
continence does not escape all harm—unharmed.
When the nervous system is aroused and the lochia flows
freely into the vagina, it is nearly always an indication of a
congestion of blood in the creative organism; and unless this
congestion is relieved by the natural process of sexual embrace,
the entire generative system suffers.
The destructive effects of continence appear much more
quickly in man because his nature is more easily aroused, and
he lacks relief because there is no release of the seminal fluid.
This fluid acts as an irritant to the urinary canal, arousing a
feeling of antagonism to everything about him and a morbidity
concerning life as a whole.
There yet is another reason why continence is of greater
harm to the male than to the female. In her, nature has

Nature does not provide the male with any such regular
source of relief. He must depend on a number of other means:
involuntary losses during sleep or with the urine—not at all
desirable—absorption of the vital fluids by the circulation; or
in Coitus.
The much - mooted question as to the intensity of desire,
whether the male or the female possesses the greater, cannot
be answered at random or en masse. The balance between the
sexes is preserved; but so far as individuals are concerned, it
varies according to their temperament.
In the practice of many years as physician, and an equal
number of years as a confessor, we have had ample opportunity
to investigate this problem thoroughly and unemotionally.
From the confessions of many women, we conclude the desire
of the female, when thoroughly aroused by real love caressess
is of an intensity unknown to any male. Her nervous system
is infinitely finer and upon the fineness of the nerves depends
the capacity to suffer or enjoy. In truth, her nervous system
may be likened to the strings of the finest Opera Grand, while
man's more closely resembles that of the old fashioned square
piano.
Many women patients have declared without hesitation that
the inflammation of the ovaries, congestion of the uterus and
the abhorrent flow of fluor albus, are directly due to passion
fully aroused but left unsatisfied.
This is so universally true that we have made it an invari-
able rule, in arriving at a correct diagnosis, to thoroughly
question the consultant relative to her habits of sex life. In

number of years as a confessor, we have had ample opportunity
to investigate this problem thoroughly and unemotionally.
From the confessions of many women, we conclude the desire
of the female, when thoroughly aroused by real love caressess
is of an intensity unknown to any male. Her nervous system
is infinitely finer and upon the fineness of the nerves depends
the capacity to suffer or enjoy. In truth, her nervous system
may be likened to the strings of the finest Opera Grand, while
man's more closely resembles that of the old fashioned square
plano.
Many women patients have declared without hesitation that
the inflammation of the ovaries, congestion of the uterus and
the abhorrent flow of fluor albus, are directly due to passion
fully aroused but left unsatisfied.
This is so universally true that we have made it an invari-
able rule, in arriving at a correct diagnosis, to thoroughly
question the consultant relative to her habits of sex life. In
seventy-five per cent of the cases under consideration, the diffi·

culty could be traced either to forced, partial, non-fulfillment
of desire or to Coitus Interruptus in one form or another.
In the single, relief may be found through a change in the
habits of life, and in local treatments and soothing applications.
Among the married, a cure is possible if there is a mutual
willingness to correct the errors of the marital embrace.
Fully fifty per cent of the sorrows, sufferings and miseries
of women, whether physical, mental or domestic, or a com-
bination of all three, are traceable to ignorance concerning
matters of sex, disobedience of the laws relating to sex or
resorting to unnatural practices.
The other fifty per cent coming under observation were the
result of a wide variety of causes, any or all of which might
accentuate the suffering due to disease of the creative organism.
Under this heading might be mentioned overwork, and the
consequent reaction, too-rich foods, or congestion of the system,
which has a strongly adverse influence on the creative organism.
In the case of girls, it has been found that dancing and other
exercises performed in the company of young men, though
unconscious on the part of the girls, arouses the passions and
emotions and creates disturbances in the generative system.
Without fear of successful contradiction, it may be stated
that while sex intensity in general may be equal in both sexes,
mere passion is much more prevalent in men than in women.
Men all too frequently seek the embrace as a matter of relief and
pleasure, while women, as previously mentioned, become
aroused sexually more through their desire to bestow pleasure
on the loved one, than through the stimulus of actual physical
passion.
Proof of this is readily found. A man upon becoming
aroused, seeks relief—even if it is through the medium of a

seemed so different from other women.
She confessed that she could not comprehend her own emo-
tions, or lack of them; that never once had she desired the sexual
embrace; never felt love for any man; was wholly without com-
prehension of the terms, "love and affection." Hearing such
subjects discussed, she felt bewildered; everything belonging to
the tender passion being totally beyond her comprehension.
The solution of the enigma was found through the mother.
She had never once known any satisfaction. All her children
were born under these conditions; were all cold of nature, sexu-
ally inert; they lacked ambition; were without the incentive to
accomplish anything in life.
The case could be traced back to another generation; the
mother being cold and unresponsive, it may well be presupposed
that her mother before her had become abnormal through abuse
or mismating.
Such conditions must be rectified, and a thorough knowledge

can be accomplished. Race regeneration cannot attain to any

manifest, God's laws.

All-Wise Father than to see his children stumbling along in the

can he ever come into an understanding of the love of the Giver
of all these gifts?

The statement is frequently made that men and women

able to live in continence with no ill effects.
Such a statement is based on a truthful fact, and on this
fact are based the instructions for the healthy unmarried. These
people intensely engaged in some specific work, concentrate
their entire mental capacity on the object in view; follow in
thought and desire the particular idea waking and sleeping;
hence all power, forces and energies are drawn to a focal point,
and used in the furtherance of the one object in life.
To such persons, continence is possible without harmful
after effects. Consciously or unconsciously, they apply one of
Nature's greatest laws—that of transmutation. The vital forces
generated by the creative system are marshalled to the brain
and absorbed through mental activity. Very few men in a

Many of the ablest physicians of the past and present declare
that men of this type border on insanity; in fact, that genius
is a form of insanity. The mind concentrated, day in and day
out, on one thing, is unbalanced, one-sided, and abnormal in

To recapitulate: The correct exercise of sex is of supreme

even more so to the world at large. If a man attempts to live,
or is compelled to live, the continent life for any length of
time, the pool of creative energy becomes stagnant; a poison
to his entire system; not only affecting both his health, and his
mentality, but also his future progeny, if any. This, in turn,
affects the economy of the world.
Non-use of the creative energy, like non-use of any other
power, energy or potentiality, creates inertia and stagnation—
and these conditions, in the human organism, invite disease,
decay and death. This is a direct violation of the laws of God
who created all things for use.

The Living Dance of "Death"
ontinence and Libertinism, though diametrically
opposite in practice, have this one outstanding point
in common: they both aim straight at the very
foundations of life. Equally baneful in their ultimate
effect on the human organism, they are but dual
aspects of the "Dance of Death." We are not, at the moment,
engaged in a philosophical dissertation on the means of REgen-
eration, although some reference to the problem seems to be in
order at this point.
While all of life begins with generation, it should end with
REgeneration or Immortalization, i.e. mortality taking on
immortality. REgeneration or Immortalization proceed hand
in hand with Race REgeneration and, together, constitute
the Divine Mystery of Sex. The "seed" known and ac-
cepted as the means of generation, is likewise the medium
of REgeneration.
This duality of the "seed" was well understood by the
ancient Initiate Priests or true Holy men. Moses, one of the
most notable of these, taught the Israelites that if they "cast
the 'seed' to Moloch," by any practice, it would become a
"serpent" or destroyer of the Soul itself; bringing disease and
death upon whoever would be guilty of the practice, while
those who "raised up the serpent" as exemplified by himself,
"upon the Cross" would have greater life and be "saved."

CONTINENCE
The Living Dance of "Death"
. ONTINENCE and Libertinism, though diametrically
opposite in practice, have this one outstanding point
in common: they both aim straight at the very
foundations of life. Equally baneful in their ultimate
effect on the human organism, they are but dual
aspeas of the "Dance of Death." We are not, at the moment,
engaged in a philosophical dissertation on the means of REgen-
eration, although some reference to the problem seems to be in
order at this point.
While all of life begins with generation, it should end with
REgeneration or Immortalization, i.e. MORTAUTI TAKING ON
IMMORTAUTI. REgeneration or Immortalization proceed hand
in hand with Race REgeneration and, together, constitute
the Divine Mystery of Sex. The "seed" known and ac-
cepted as the means of generation, is likewise the medium
of REgeneration.
This duality of the "seed" was well understood by the
ancient Initiate Priests or true Holy men. Moses, one of the
most notable of these, taught the Israelites that if they "cast
the 'seed' to Moloch," by any practice, it would become a
"serpent" or destroyer of the Soul itself; bringing disease and
death upon whoever would be guilty of the practice, while
those who "raised up the serpent" as exemplified by himself,
"upon the Cross" would have greater life and be "saved."
Considered in terms of the ultimate, the effect upon man,

both as concerns his body and Soul, or what the church generally
terms "the spirit," it matters little whether this "seed" is cast
upon the ground as a result of the unfinished marital embrace,
the practice of various forms of solitary vice—self-pollution—
or unjustified continence. In either case, the penalty is the
same.
It may logically be questioned whether the "seed" is not
also lost in the marital rite when pregnancy does not follow.
Emphatically not in the normal embrace. Whether pregnancy
does or does not result, there is an exchange of the vital forces
of life between the twain.
The semen is the agent or carrier of these vital, positive,
electric, creative forces to woman; while she, in, and by, the
lochia, releases to man the vital magnetic forces. The exchange
of these vital life forces between man and woman, are essential
to health, normalcy of mind and balance.
Countless wives continually discourage husbands from com-
pleting the marital rite, due to fear of pregnancy. These women
soon become haggard in appearance and old long before their
time; nervous wrecks after a few years of married life.
The repeated interruption of the rite and the resulting lack
of mutual exchange results first in congestion, then irritation
and, finally, in an increased desire for Coitus, a vicious circle
of destruction to health and well-being.
The husband suffers similarity; first a congestion, then irrita-
tion; finally seeking relief elsewhere than in the home; or
shunning that, turns to excessive drinking or other debauchery
for relief.

the subject is that continence is the law of life; that Coitus en-

Even if pregnancy results through the practice of the marital
rite, it does so only about once in a hundred times, and even
then but one spermatozoon impregnates and fecundates the

expressed or yearning to be expressed, kill out the connection
with the spiritual nature within, and turns the body, which
should show forth the loveliness of God-mind, into a carnal
house of disease and discord. All attempts to satisfy one's
desires, whatever be their nature, through outside alliance
gives the lie to the truth that man is complete in himself,
satisfied from God, and ultimately leads to dissatisfaction, woe
and death."
The theory of continence built on such reasoning, appears
to be sound and consistent with God's law, but a little reason-

just that. If there is a sound and sane reason for the necessity
of so doing, then psychological factors enter into the problem
and these then govern, modifying the results.
The teachings of youth may influence all of life for better
or worse. We have in mind the experience of a maiden lady
into whose mind had been instilled the undesirability of sex
expression in woman and the shame of experiencing an orgasm.
This lady had lived an absolutely virtuous life, when, at the
age of thirty-eight, she fell in love and was married to a man
in full possession of his manhood.
Through endearments she was made conscious of the falsity
of her earlier instructions and the awakening of a desire to
reciprocate affection to the full. What was her horror to find
that, try as she would, she could not be brought to the normal
climax and the keen relaxation that always follows. Her very
Soul seemed to cry out to her: "Thus far and no farther canst
thou go." Attempt after attempt was made to unlock the flood-
gate of love and obtain relief and ease, but without success.
Gradually, the nervous system became acutely affected, and
the lady, broken in courage, health and spirit, at last sought re-
lief from one who understood.
The errors of the past teachings were pointed out to her
and when she fully understood her errors, a deep psychological
change took place in her inner self. Freedom took the place
of the bondage to erroneous ideas. Gradually, she became nor-
mal in thought and feeling and began to regain her health and
the enjoyment to which her wedded love entitled her.
We have outlined some of the more extreme results of the

There are many lesser evils which ought to be of sufficient
warning to reasonable, rational, human beings.
The first indication of trouble may be nervousness in any
one of its various forms, and without apparent cause. Then
follow other disturbing symptoms in rapid succession; possibly
an irritability making the person a most undesirable companion;
gloomy, "touchy," disposed to look on the dark side of every-
thing. More advanced symptoms include loss of appetite and
malnutrition; incapacity to concentrate; lack of decision and
stick-to-it-ness; desire for constant change; nervous headaches
due to a deranged nervous system; inability to digest even
simple food; constipation and toxo-absorption; ending in neur-
asthenia, just a step removed from mental incapacity.
The debauchee's life precipitates about the same general
weaknesses. The wasting of the life forces depletes them faster
than man can accumulate them. The mixture of different rates
of vibration; various currents of magnetic forces coming from
many women, will destroy the strongest man, demagnetizing
him, and shattering his life forces.
Continence is a dragon with an hundred heads; each with
a sting of death.
In many instances the devotee, if a male, experiences just
the opposite of the torrefaction—drying up—of the vivifying
forces. There may be an unnatural accumulation. This, together
with a lesion of the generative organism, induces continuous

We cannot find an argument in favor of the destructive
practice of continence. Admittedly, there are periods in the
lives of most men when it is both right and expedient to
abstain from the sexual embrace; as when the wife is ill, or
during the absence of either one or the other from the home;
but this is merely abstinence, not continence; and the mind does
not dwell on the enforced denial; rather looks cheerfully for-

Under these conditions health, peace, and happiness are the
natural accompaniments of the embrace. If a man brutally
ignores a woman's feelings and forces his attentions upon her,
he commits a crime no less than married prostitution, ignoble
license.

husband finally seeking a mistress; the wife a lover, or divorce.
Teachers of continence may assert that the diseases and
effects here attributed to continence are as easily applied to
those indulging in the marriage rite. We have already admitted
all this. The penalty for abuse of sex, in or out of wedlock,
is equally as severe as for the practice of unnecessary continence.
In other respects the proof may be declared absolute. For
example: The long sex life of the man who practices the
marriage rite normally; while the continent man cannot claim
longevity of sex. Admittedly, if the latter is consistent, he does
not seek continued virility. The argument favors the potency
of sex; the man being considered as youthful, or in his prime
only so long as he retains his virility. Thereafter, he is an "old

One point remains undisputed. Neither man nor woman
has any right to practice the marriage rite without love as the
impetus. If the act is performed under any other thought,
desire, or incentive, it is a violation; and a marriage ceremony,
irrespective of who may have performed it, cannot set aside the
great fiat flung into space by God.
If there is no real affection between husband and wife, if
they do not love each other, and the husband demands con-
jugal "rights" and she complies, they are both guilty of a form
of prostitution. The woman will not, cannot, release the
magnetic forces and the man is incapable of infusing the vital
forces. The climax may occur; there will be a sort of
physical satisfaction, but neither receives the psychic, or spir-
itualized essence which should always be the aim of cohabita-
tion; the vital essential to health, strength, peace and happiness
to both.
Writers and instructors have emphasized the act in itself,
or the elimination of it altogether, missing the important point
just enunciated, which must be the underlying fundamental
insisted upon in Race Regeneration. Until this is fully under-
stood and practiced, misery and weakness will continue to be
the "benefit" of the marriage rite.
Much comment has been voiced upon the love starvation
of the race. Love is, and always has been. It is as natural and
as necessary to every human being as food. The advocates of
continence would have us believe that we may love without
passion. That is utterly impossible. The moment a man dearly
and sincerely loves a woman, one of the expressions of that
emotion is possession for him; with her it is to be possessed.

itualized essence which should always be the aim of cohabita-
tion; the vital essential to health, strength, peace and happiness
to both.
Writers and instructors have emphasized the act in itself,
or the elimination of it altogether, missing the important point
just enunciated, which must be the underlying fundamental
insisted upon in Race Regeneration. Until this is fully under-
stood and practiced, misery and weakness will continue to be
the "benefit" of the marriage rite.
Much comment has been voiced upon the love starvation
of the race. Love is, and always has been. It is as natural and
as necessary to every human being as food. The advocates of
continence would have us believe that we may love without
passion. That is utterly impossible. The moment a man dearly
and sincerely loves a woman, one of the expressions of that
emotion is possession for him; with her it is to be possessed.
God created man in His own image; that is, He conferred

upon man wisdom and love, the attributes of Himself. The
fact that man manifests in the material while God manifests
in the spiritual, is nowise a contradiction. Men are co-workers
with Jehovah, the Creator, and the creative, generative organ-
ism, together with the inherent desire to junction thereby, sub-
stantiates this assertion.
Had it been ordained that men and women should live sep-
arately as sex weaklings, God never would have implanted in
man so generously the incentive to creative expression; nor
would He have instilled in man the urge for more or less
frequent companionship, ending in embrace with the beloved.
Had He intended the indulgence to occur once a year, or once
in two years, then only for the purpose of reproduction, He
would have changed human emotions and desires to conform
with such a law.
Were it true that man is capable of loving without passion,
then the opposite would be equally true; men then could and
should perform the creative act without the incentive of love.
Such a thought is revolting; the consequences even more so;
it is beastly, unhuman, degrading.
Love lies at the basis of passion; and in its correct under-
standing, passion is the basis of love. The potentiality in man
to love, or hate, or achieve, is in direct ratio to the virility of
his creative potency. The weakly sexed, cannot surely love.
Therefore:
The man living the continent life is incapable of expressing
love in its highest aspect.

It is only when continued for a length of time sufficient to
break down the moral stamina, indicating likewise a loss of
brain and Soul force, that the practitioner of solitary vice or
mutual masturbation, becomes blase enough to face his own
emaciated self and the world at large, without pangs of
conscience.
The practice is demoralizing even if indulged infrequently,
because a certain amount of vital force is wasted without the
possibility of recovery. It is giving something and receiving
nothing, therefore robbery of the self, hence is self-defrauding.
The more frequently practiced, the nearer man, or the woman,
draws to the brink of moral degradation and physical imbecility.
The act in itself is evil; it is debasing; unfitting every man who
is guilty, to meet face to face any pure woman; not mentioning
meeting the Giver of Life.
"There are many unmarried women, maiden ladies, and es-

they practiced some form of auto-erotism occasionally."
We personally place ourselves on record as voicing the senti-
ment, that if the sexual desire of any woman, whether maiden
lady or widow, becomes so insistent that relief is actually neces-
sary, then it would be far better for them, body and Soul, and the

maidens of India—veil their faces and sit before the temple—
accepting the offer of the first man that passes.
Thus would the relief sought be obtained; seed would not be

"As a matter of fact, all boys masturbate, and many girls

engaged in some form of auto-erotism, at some time in their
lives, and the estimate is probably too low rather than too high.

It is utterly false that all boys are guilty of self-pollution.
Admittedly the majority are, ignorantly so, but this does not
permit any man to teach that it is right to practice self-abuse.
Likewise it is true that many girls are victims of the habit,
and with what results? We have known of women who in-
dulged in the destructive practice before they were married,
and after marriage preferred it to the natural creative embrace;
'Even if this were true, the practice is not justified by any mora!, health
or spiritual law. Our author does not state how many have become degenerates,
physical or mental weaklings as a result of the practice.
'If plural masturbation and the consequent pollution is not wrong, then
there is no sex sin and boys and girls, as well as men and women, may commit
all the abnormal practices they wish with no penalty attached.
Moreover, the Bible and all its teachings may be discarded. The many writers
who dwelt on the evils in various forms of degradation as the result of "casting
the seed upon the ground," must be in error. It is equally certain that all writers
opposing this view are not to be accepted as teaching Divine Law to mankind.
'This statement is true in fart, but the implications are false. There should
be relief, but this must be by means of right use, not by ABUSE; by the applica-
tion of natural laws; a correct and non-irritating, non-stimulating diet, exercise,
transmutation of the forces, reabsorption into the blood stream and other methods
both simple and effective. Nature will co-operate with those who will co-operate
with nature.

or spiritual law. Our author does not state how many have become degenerates,
physical or mental weaklings as a result of the practice.
• If plural masturbation and the consequent pollution is not wrong, then
there is no sex sin and boys and girls, as well as men and women, may commit
all the abnormal practices they wish with no penalty attached.
Moreover, the Bible and all its teachings may be discarded. The many writers
who dwelt on the evils in various forms of degradation as the result of "casting
the seed upon the ground," must be in error. It is equally certain that all writers
opposing this view are not to be accepted as teaching Divine Law to mankind.
sThis statement is true in fact, but the implications are false. There should
be relief, but this must be by means of right lise, not by ABUSE; by the applica-
tion ot natural laws; a correct and non-irritating, non-stimulating diet, exercise,
transmutation of the forces, reabsorption into the blood scream and other methods
both simple and effective. Nature will co-operate with those who will cooOperate
with nature.

desires were fully aroused, then turning the cold shoulder to
them; defrauding both themselves and their husbands by a
recurrence to the old degrading habit. Can any one imagine
anything more abominable than this? Yet this is what perver-
ters of human virtues inculcate.
True, the sexual organism is an active entity; constantly
secreting fluids that are life-giving; it being essential to health
and well-being to keep these vital forces in circulation—
this offers no excuse for abuse or the waste of the vital life
forces—it is merely an indication that they should be natur-
ally utilized; the method being either through a reabsorption
into the circulation and a transmutation into physical, mental
and Soul forces; or an exchange between the male and female.
God created the two, male and female created He them; He
comprehended that neither one nor the other could possibly be
sufficient unto the self, consequently He gave them the means
to mate. Auto-erotism is a crime greater than murder or patri-
cide, because the practice destroys the self; redemption then be-
comes impossible. We quote again:
"Sometimes, during the five days of menstruation, during
which time the union of the organs is deemed not best, the wife
can thus help her lover with her hand, to his delight and
benefit."
We would inquire, what of the woman during this period?
If he suffers, how much greater must be the longing on her
part as she fondles him, but is herself denied, and what must
be her reactions?

The practice of mutual masturbation previously considered,
destroys the parties participating by draining them gradually
of their virile force without replacing it through exchange.

In speaking of the male weakling, who has not sufficient manly
strength to satisfy the longings of his mate, he writes:
"After a man has passed the orgasm, it is, in most cases,
impossible for him to continue the act, right then and there,
and bring the woman to the climax, if she has not yet arrived,
from the fact that, with the expulsion of the semen, usually detu-
mescence of the glans at once takes place, and the organ is
incapable of exciting the woman when in this condition.7
"If the husband is ahead first, there is no possibility of the
wife's reaching the climax at that embrace. This leaves her
unsatisfied, all her sex organs congested, and the whole situation
is unsatisfactory in the extreme."
We fully concur in the last sentence as it expresses exact
facts. We have italicized them to call the reader's special atten-
tion to the truths voiced; thus clearly indicating how inconsist-
ent is the average writer on these subjects, and how illogical
his conclusions.
In instances of indulgence in the sexual embrace, where the
strength of the husband is insufficient for the satisfaction of his
wife, forcing him to discontinue the marriage rite before she
reaches the climax, he at least bathes her creative organism with
the seminal fluid; doing much toward reducing the inflamma-
tion and irritation resulting from unsatisfied desire.
In conjugal fraud, termed reservatus, not even this occurs.
The congested, inflamed organism is forced to attempt gradually
to "throw back" into circulation the blood and the fluids which
were held ready for expulsion and exchange at the crisis; and
has to contend with the after-irritation without the soothing
serums to relieve the intensity of it.

If, as the author admits, and which we maintain is true, the
unsatisfied desire of the wife and consequent congestion has
serious results on her health, how much greater, think you, is
the continuous congesting and resulting irritation following
the repeated conjugal fraud (reservatus) suggested; lacking the
cooling and healing effects of being bathed by the seminal fluid?
We have personally listened to the confessions and treated
an uncounted number of women suffering from the effects of
love-hunger as the result of weakness in the husbands. These
wives were to be pitied, but could be helped by careful in-
structions.
In most instances they accepted the situation, being mindful
of the "for better or for worse" of the marriage ceremony;
respecting their husbands, believing them blameless.
At the same time, we have come in close relationship with
an almost equal number of women whose husbands continually
defraud them by coitus reservatus; most of these poor wives
are beyond hope; having lost faith in nature, man and God.
They are "burned out," like hollow trees ravished by forest
fires; the inner spirit crushed and shrunken; the Soul seared and
distorted; sex itself having become the serpent creeping in the
dust on its belly and, like it, cursed by God.
Even these can be saved if they are willing to obey, but most
of them are no longer possessed of sufficient stamina to make
the required effort toward self-redemption.
In the quotation to follow, the author foolishly believes he
is offering credulous man the key to the Paradise of Love;
whereas, as a fact, he is teaching the most direct route to Pros-
tatic ailments, the most dreadful ravages from which man can
suffer; frequently termed the "hell-fire" of middle to old age.

'get run away with,' and feel that it is better to go on and have
the climax, all right. But, as time goes on, the practice of carry-

in due time will be well established.8 Those who have mastered

We heartily concur in the statement relative to the desira-
bility of relieving the suffering of the woman resultant on her
not being brought to the climax, but have never known of the
necessity for semi-erotic practices on the part of the husband;
one who is more or less of a weakling can be instructed in
natural methods, making it possible for him to perform his
manly conjugal duties with entire satisfaction.

the married, as note the following:
"If a bride and bridegroom knew enough to introduce each
other to the delights of an organism (orgasm) by 'spending'
each other by external excitation of the organs with their hands
a few times before they united the organs at all, it would be to
their lasting well-being. This is especially true for the bride.

on, as she sat on his lap, in their bridal chamber, alone, and
stroked her vulva till she 'spent,' the chances are many to one
that he would have introduced her to such joy that she would
never forget it, all her life."

examinations of a Medical College, could possibly be guilty of

We venture to say that if actual knowledge and experience
is essential to the welfare of his daughter, the average father
who is also a man in the true sense of the term, would far prefer
to see his daughter in the arms of a clean man, even though he
is not her husband, and the embrace righteously consummated,
thus permitting them the continued freedom of being able to
face their fellow-being and God without shame, than to have
her guilty of this shameful practice, damned by God, causing
the actor to hide the face with shame.
"The fact is, this whole matter of sexual excitation by means
of the hand, or in any other way than the union of the organs,

has been fastened to such acts, and then, any and every form

stimulation" is properly applied to the method of arousing the

THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SEX
or almost one hundred years there has been established
and laboring in America an organization1 now world
wide, having as one of its fundamental teachings the
inculcation of a livable philosophy dealing with Race
REgeneration and the spiritualization of sex.
This laudable activity has been, and continues to be, actively
engaged in instructing its members in the positive tenet that
God created man and woman in the first instance, in His own
image, so that they, in turn, might imitate Him.
He at the same time conferred upon them the power and
ability to employ this same creative potential in the REgenera-
tion of their own self-being, thereby making certain that their
"Mortality should take on Immortality" so that they might
be enabled to begin living life eternal here and now.
The certainty of the possibility of Immortalizing the Soul
of man (the term "Soul" being more correct than the word
"spirit") by means of a moral life and the correct exercise
of the procreative function, has been, and still is, almost uni-
versally denied. The general conception almost universally
accepted, is that the sex function has no purpose beyond pro-
creation of the species; plus the fact that the same function, if
unwisely exercised, leads to degradation of the spiritual self.

THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SEX
II
OR almost one hundred years there has been established
. -. and laboring in America an organization1
now world
wide, having as one of its fundamental teachings the
:. . - inculcation of a livable philosophy dealing with Race
REgeneration and the spiritualization of sex.
This laudable activity has been, and continues to be, actively
engaged in instructing its members in the positive tenet that
God created man and woman in the first instance, in His own
image, so that they, in turn, might imitate Him.
He at the same time conferred upon them the power and
ability to employ this same creative potential in the REgenera-
tion of their own self-being, thereby making certain that their
"Mortality should take on Immortality" so that they might
be enabled to begin living life ecernal here and now.
The certainty of the possibility of Immortalizing the Soul
of man (the term "Soul" being more correct than the word
"spirit" ) by means of a moral life and the correct exercise
of the procreative function, has been, and stilI is, almost uni-
versally denied. The general conception almost universally
accepted, is that the sex function has no purpose beyond pro-
creation of the species; plus the fact that the same function, if
unwisely exercised, leads to degradation of the spiritual self.
This concepcion denies the laws of logic which teach us
that all action is dual; that the pendulum of the clock must
swing as far to the right as it does to the left in order that
balance and activity (life) be maintained.

MYSTERY OF SEX
If we admit the possibility that abuse of the creative func-
tion may bring about damnation, then it assuredly is sane to
admit that its right and normal exercise has the potentiality
of elevating the Soul above the carnal into the spiritual.
Creation on the human plane identifies the act whereby man
brings into being a new body in preparation as the habitation
for a Soul; REcreation or REgeneration is the method of trans-
muting the mortal into the Immortal; Biblically speaking
"Mortality taking on Immortality."
Possibly, for a clearer distinction of terms, we might better
say: REcreation is the process of rebirth spiritually; of so
purifying the body that sickness and weakness will be eradicated.
REgeneration is that greater work of bringing into active mani-
festation the mighty Soul, a counterpart of God—that part of
man which is usually allowed to lie dormant; to return to the
Father at death of the physical no more spiritualized than when
it left Him to take up its habitation in the mortal frame.
To the majority of thinkers it appears incomprehensible
that the established religious denominations defend the accept-
ance of Biblical writings in their literal sense, giving credit
for all Wisdom, while at the same time denying that sex has
any other function than that of the creation of bodies for Souls
to inhabit. Herein, in our experience, is the entire weakness
of religious inculcations.
This inconsistency is all the more glaring in the face of
the Biblical record that Moses, the great Law-giver, based the
salvation of the Israelites, during their sojourns in the wilder-
ness, on the uplifted serpent. Interpreted: On the purification
and elevation of the creative desire and exalting sex relationships.

Land, due to their ignorance of the Divine Law governing the
creative function, so greatly abused, degraded and exercised
the sex function for sense-gratification and became such per-
verts that there was immediate danger of the race degenerating
to the point of utter self-destruction.
Moses sensed the impending evil, and with the wisdom
obtained through his long years as a novitiate in the Priesthood
of Egypt, realized that the evil was based on a misapprehension
of the right exercise of the creative function.
He knew that a power potent to destroy was equally effec-
tive to save. To protect the remnant of the people, he incul-
cated the practice, through the symbology of the uplifted
serpent, of engaging in the marital rite for no other purpose
than to create new units for incarnating Souls, and the REgen-
eration of the self-being. This he commanded as a religious
rite ordained by the living God and by so doing, saved the
children in the wilderness.
Moses was impelled to impress them with the constructive
law, teaching them that the misuse and perversion of the
Creative function, and the continued "casting of the seed upon
the ground," (so terming the "unfinished" as well as solitary
acts) would result, not only in the extinction of "God's
annointed," but of every people guilty of the unholy practice.
He told his people that it was equally dynamic in the de-
struction of the Soul; voicing the fiat that "the Soul that sinneth,
it shall die," because the casting of the germ of life (seed in
the seminal fluid) upon the ground is Soul destroying. This
is by reason of the indisputable fact that the essence which the
laboratory, in the Biblical "reins," uses in the manufacture of
the "seed" is identical with both nerve and brain material; a
misuse of one being abuse of the other.

In the Ancient Egyptian Mystic Religion, in the days before

fundamental tenets, the first lesson to be learned in the Secret
Doctrine, was the right use of sex, i.e., for the procreation of new
bodies, the REcreation of the self-body and the REgeneration

these while a novitiate in the Priesthood; thereafter basing his
entire moral code on these principles, and was thereby enabled
to save his followers.
Christianity (established orthodoxy), following the Mosaic
dispensation, has consistently rejected the Spiritual side of the
moral code formulated by Moses. Because of this fact, it has
thus far been practically impossible to interest any major por-
tion of humanity in the great problem which we recognize
as the basis for most of the social diseases and degradation on
the one hand, and the salvation of both body and Soul, on the
other.
Churchism gives prominence to the doctrine that all child-
ren are born in sin, while revealed religion, harmonizing with
Holy Scripture teaches us that, though children may be born
through sin, that is, through cohabitation by those who "lust,"
because they do not love or have affection for each other,
nevertheless, they are not born in sin, nor do they actually
commit sin before the age of responsibility—after the period
of change from boyhood to manhood, or girlhood to
womanhood.

and indulged in the sexual embrace for pleasure and satisfac-
tion, instead of only for procreation and REcreation.
Irrespective of all that we have said, the creative function
may be exercised without "sinning." Had our first parents
obeyed God's law, embraced only for the purpose of procrea-
tion, or the REcreation of themselves and the REgeneration of
their own Souls, bringing them into a likeness of the Father,
there would have been no sin, sorrow, or death.
Very early after attaining the age of responsibility they
learned of the possibility of indulging solely for pleasure and
satisfaction through the act, and, in self-seeking, forgot God's
fiat, and sin was the result. From this it must not be understood
that pleasure and satisfaction is forbidden, but it may not be
the primary incentive for action.
Accepting these statements as a correct interpretation of
the Divine Law, the reader might conclude there could be no
sin, provided the marriage rite was completed and, the woman
participating being virile, a child resulted from the union. This
is far from a correct or complete statement of fact; "sin"
being defined as an "act potent of bringing harm to the self,
or sorrow and suffering to another."
In fact, a drunkard or a degenerate might be the party to
an embrace; the union might be completed and a child born
as the result; yet, because of the status of the actors, the child
might possibly be either a weakling or an idiot. Such a condi-
tion would confer upon the child an inheritance of sorrow
or/and suffering, consequently be an evil.
Likewise there is the possibility of a libertine cohabiting
with a woman of immoral habits, resulting in a new creation.

We freely admit there may be reasons for a continent life,
as for instance, where one or both parties are under great mental
strain, nervous tension, or some severe sorrow. Where one or
both of those concerned is of a cold and unloving disposition,
divorce, rather than continence, must finally be the solution of
the problem, though in all too many instances this is highly
undesirable because of minor children in the family.
The letter previously quoted is typical. When many such
letters are received, each with an appeal for knowledge, must
we not naturally conclude that the need for correct and rational
instructions on Sex Hygiene, Eugenics, Race Development and
REgeneration, is acute? It is actually appalling when once we
comprehend the necessity for such knowledge and investigate
what passes for information on the solution of the problem.
If we desire to enlighten mankind, and thereby save nations
from the sex perversion such as destroyed all of the mighty
civilizations of the past, including Egypt, Greece and Rome,
we must seek the root of the trouble, and there apply the
remedy; this we cannot do unless we face the evil without fear
or cavil.
Unless we are biased, we will be perfectly willing to care-
fully study all that is written by the great leader of the Israelites.

God gave him the laws governing the creative functions, even

letters are received, each with an appeal for knowledge, must
we not naturally conclude that the need for correct and rational
instructions on Sex Hygiene, Eugenics, Race Development and
REgeneration, is acute? It is actually appalling when once we
comprehend the necessity for such knowledge and investigate
what passes for information on the solution of the problem.
If we desire to enlighten mankind, and thereby save nations
from the sex perversion such as destroyed all of the mighty
civilizations of the past, including Egypt, Greece and Rome,
we must seek the root of the trouble, and there apply the
remedy; this we cannot do unless we face the evil without fear
or cavil.
Unless we are biased, we will be perfealy willing to care-
fully study all that is written by the great leader of the Israelites.
Nowhere is there an indication that Moses complained when
God gave him the laws governing the creative functions, even
though he also was taught that these laws were identical with
those which, obeyed, would confer Immorrality on man.
The preachments of all denominations lay great stress on the
evils of fornication, adultery, and husbanding the harlot; and

rightly so; but nothing whatever is taught respecting the dire
results of indulging in the marriage rite by those who, though
married, do not love each other.
Pious eyes are closed to multitudes of instances where women
are forced to comply with the demands of their wedded part-
ners even though every fibre of their being revolts at the mere
request. An unbelievable number of husbands request and
receive favors from wives for whom they have no love, because
they fear accusation of unfaithfulness; although as a matter of
fact, the wives granting the privilege may have lost all affection
for their husbands.
We contend that when the husband demands favors from his
wife who does not love him, it will gradually create an aversion
on her part, which in time will unbalance the system and bring
about various mental, nervous and general diseases, with all
the attendant evils; while for him, if long continued, it will
mean final "damnation" to both body and Soul.
Should children issue from such indulgence, they, as often
as not, are moral and possibly physical weaklings, if not actually
idiotic. If a boy, he may become a libertine or pervert; while
a girl will possibly be another candidate for street walker,
inviting general condemnation, even from those who take
advantage of her service. Neither boy nor girl is held respon-
sible under the Eternal law. Rather, the guilt lies at the door
of those fathers and mothers guilty of procreation when love
was not the basis of the union.
In countless instances of legalized prostitution, unnumbered
children are born; lacking in their love nature, in spirituality,

|HE curse of mankind in every age has been radical-
ism; from one extreme we swing to the other. Either
we respect neither law nor order, or we legislate
every privilege out of existence, making slaves of
men.
Our former understanding of all that concerns sex has been
irrational. For long centuries the sexual organism has been
believed a shameful possession; thought of as unmentionable;
its exercise indulged for pleasure and personal satisfaction;
while the procreation of the species has been mainly accidental.
At last we are beginning to comprehend both the potentiality
and sacredness of sex. With this enlightened understanding of
the most important function native to the human being we are
facing the spectacle of sex weaklings and human icebergs
swinging to the chimerical and paranoiac extreme of inculcat-
ing not alone non-use of the function, but also teaching the
possibility of reaching physical Immortality and the birth of
children without the exercise of the function; first weakening
the creative organism by non-use, finally degrading it; ending
in the degeneration of the body and destruction of the otherwise
Immortal Soul.
The degradation of sex in its many aspects is increasing
alarmingly. Very few of our citizens seem aware of this fact
and have no knowledge except that we are forced to contend
with destructive and degrading social diseases and the Red
Light districts of our large cities.

MYSTERY OF SEX
Generally men and women are unaware that the people are
gradually becoming inoculated with a potential habit fruitful
for the destruction of the race, through teaching of the phan-
tasmal doctrine that the separation of the sexes was a mistake,
brought about through sin; that man must find within himself
the female; sex, as at present understood, becoming extinct,
and children in the future born—the Lord knows how.
To the rational mind it seems highly improbable that such
a fantastic idea could take root in the mentality of a people
presumed to be well educated, enlightened and well balanced
mentally. The actual fact is that we are being flooded with
letters asking questions on the "how of this method," clearly
indicating that many have become converted to this new "doc-
trine of death."
We are fully aware of the fact that a book written in the
abstract and based on supposition, is seldom convincing. It
therefore becomes us to deal with concrete instances.
Before us we have a letter in which the writer, an intellectual
woman widely known as a teacher, questions thus: "I do not
believe any life can be happy and complete without Holy
Matrimony, do you?" We readily answer; "It cannot."
But there is more to this letter, as follows: "Male and Female
in one." Here is the root of the trouble.
This woman, who daily comes in contact with many people,
both men and women, and who is capable of influencing
others, is continually inculcating the tenet that men and women
once awakened, are complete within themselves and no longer
require the opposite sex either as mates or companions; the
solution to the enigma being the non-exercise of the creative
function; suppression of all desires, and aspiring to find the
completion and satisfaction of the opposite sex within.

As the rational mind can readily understand, the non-use
and suppression, with such an idea in mind, has an action on
the internal body similar to that resulting when we partly fill
a barrel with fresh fruit juice, adding sugar and yeast, then
tightly corking it.
Just as soon as fermentation begins, a new force is created;
this will produce an explosion; or, if the barrel is too strong,
a gradual stagnation of the liquid takes place, ending in
spoilation.
In the human organism the non-use and suppression, which
naturally includes retention, creates an irritation of the entire
genital organism; this in turn gives rise to an abnormal outlook
on life itself; followed by the hallucination of having become
one of those especially chosen by God and anointed for the
kingdom of eternal bliss.
The normal mind is incapable of conceiving the actual men-
tal attitude of those who labor under such a delusion; we there-
fore quote extensively from another letter before us:
"Masturbation and kindred practices, common in the homes
and out of them, all come out of the lusts of the flesh, and
have been stimulated just as much by legalized lust as by
unlegalized lust. By legalized lust I mean the coming together
of a man and woman under the marriage law in the heat of
passion to gratify the flesh.
"This often results in the bringing forth of a child who is
alike stimulated in the flesh with ungodly passion, and eventu-
ally this apparently innocent child (boy or girl) falls a victim
to vice which has not been weeded out through the teaching
of godly ideas. So long as parents believe that legalized lust
is sanctioned by not only the state, but also by God, the case
is hopeless."

Much of this is admittedly true and such instructions were
commendable, but directly after this sensible dissertation, we
are told:
"The truth to be taught is the Truth that Jesus Christ
proclaimed—that when men are risen from the dead—that is,
out of the dream sleep of pleasure and pain of the senses, that
they neither marry nor are given in marriage, neither do they
die any more (indulge in sex exchange of excitement of any
nature) but become as angels in heaven—like unto the aspira-
tional nature which is in the higher conscience of man."
Here is the key to the saving (?) philosophy taught by this
woman to large numbers of both sexes. It appeals to almost
all of the cold-by-nature, neurotically emotional type of both
men and women.
It is admitted by physicians and investigators that we are
rapidly becoming a nation of neurasthenics; and in all of these
neurotics, already abnormal, there is a response to the teaching
which denies exercise of the creative function.
This quickly wins the unthinking man and woman by the
promise that they will "become as angels of heaven." We
continue quoting:
"But the Master said, only those to whom it is given, can
receive this Truth. Evidently it is not yet given to you to
receive it. But as man purifies himself, willing to lose his life
in order that he may find the Christ, God gives us the heaped
up measure of Himself in idea, word and act. Thus is God
made manifest among men; and thus does the Word become
flesh and dwells among us."

We wonder whether the writer did not know, or has for-

that it was good," that "male and female created He them"?
Certainly the writer's statement that in "the sixth day is the

of one.

of suffering from fainting spells, and otherwise feeling below

Marriage takes place in the consciousness. Thus is born the
enlightened Soul. This does not prohibit marriage in the flesh
between two who love each other; rather, it is an incentive
to contract such a bond, thereby conferring upon an hungering
world the blessings of a progeny born from the enlightened
and exalted love union.
It is necessary that sex should be under control, but over-
coming is not indicative of the destruction or deadening of
the function; rather the exercise of it for wise and holy purposes;
that is, for procreation, recreation, and regeneration; all of these
are possible through the love union between man and woman.
It is altogether false that "all the rottenness of mortality"
comes out of the "most sacred relationship." This is a lie, and
a libel on God and His creation. It casts a stigma on all those
who love one another and find health, strength, happiness and
eventually Immortality, in their mutual love embraces.
Admittedly, the sorrows of mortality spring from the sensual
relationship between two people who seek each other only to
the extent of indulging. As it has been frequently pointed out,
that which can destroy life, can also offer life.
The fact that an exercise is destructive to one under unfavor-
able circumstances, is not the least indicative that it is harmful
to another under different circumstances. Man no more sep-
arated himself from the female than did any of the other sexed
creatures part one from the other. The creative law launched

Neither man, nor woman, is able to reach Immortality by such
an abnormal life; nor can the Garden of Eden be so entered.
Love is the only key to that garden, and this love must be
manifested by true affection and all this implies, between man
and woman, and of both for God.
Consider the new and painless method for the propagation
of the species, as taught by this new Avatar who so knowingly
tells us God's plans:
"The manner of bringing forth children in the Sixth Root
race is clearly revealed to me. I explained it to my class last
night. We are studying the Third Chapter of Genesis and
clarifying consciousness on many points. You should have
heard the class, then you would not be anxious about how the
Ideal Man is to be born, nor how he is to be housed.
"One thing I can assure you, the Ideal Man, like Jesus, will
be born above the 'ways of men' (men, being the state of
consciousness formed through the action of adulterated
thought). Mary had to rebel against the modern methods of
maternity before she could sing her Mary (merry) song, 'My
Soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in
Christ, my Saviour.'3
"Christ is the Saviour in this day as it was in the days of
Mary—and Jesus Christ is to be the body that is to manifest—
the body of Christ ideas."

Death.

Neither man, nor woman, is able to reach Immortality by such
an abnormal life; nor can the Garden of Eden be so entered.
Love is the only key to that garden, and this love must be
manifested by true affection and all this implies, between man
and woman, and of both for God.
Consider the new and painless method for the propagation
of the species, as taught by this new Avatar who so knowingly
tells us God's plans:
"The manner of bringing forth children in the Sixth Root
race is clearly revealed to me. I explained it to my class last
night. We are studying the Third Chapter of Genesis and
clarifying consciousness on many points. You should have
heard the class, then you would not be anxious about how the
Ideal Man is to be born, nor how he is to be housed.
"One thing I can assure you, the Ideal Man, like Jesus, will
be born above the 'ways of men' (men, being the state of
consciousness formed through the action of adulterated
thought). Mary had to rebel against the modern methods of
maternity before she could sing her Mary (merry) song, 'My
Soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in
Christ, my Saviour.'H
"Christ is the Saviour in this day as it was in the days of
Mary-and Jesus Christ is to be the body that is to manifest-
the body of Christ ideas."
•A mighty truth perversely interpreted and leading many into the P6Ih of
D,41h.

One might smile at and ignore such an exposition of the
most sacred relationship that can exist between man and
woman, with its possibility of linking them directly with
humanity and God, were it not for the knowledge that the
number deluded by such doctrines is increasing daily, despite
the fact that none of these disciples of the blind and misleading
leaders has ever been enabled to materialize "one of the flesh
out of the Spirit," and that not a single one has actually mani-
fested health, strength, vitality, happiness or lasting success.

Our Platform: Birth control should be advocated and per-

First: The male is afflicted with a communicable disease
such as Syphilis or some form of degeneracy or mental affliction;
when the female is physically weak, or suffering from can-
cer, tuberculosis, a blood disease, or has a history of mental

Third: The parents are frequently of the lower strata of
society whose members refuse to assume the responsibility that
parenthood imposes.
Fourth: The husband or wife, or both, are habitual drunk-

parentage*.
There can be no love without passion. It is self-evident that
when the average wedded pair exercise the creative function
and results do not become apparent, there must be a weakness
or abuse somewhere in the relationship. There are many con-
traceptions, but none of them are absolutely certain; and as
previously stated, many of them are detrimental to the well-
being of those participating. If the instructions we have perused
and reported as coming from the Birth Control advocates are
authentic, then it would be far better for the moral spiritual
welfare of the average man and woman to continue in their
former manner of life and have children than to damn them
selves body and Soul.
Seeking the pleasure of frequent indulgence, but hoping to
avoid the penalty, my lady accidently doth conceive. Her mind
is constantly on the thought of not wanting the child; impress-
ing this on the child's mentality, thus preventing a normal
development of the mental faculties, while also interfering with
the natural bodily growth; with the result that the one born is
either mentally defective, physically perverted or becomes a
moral leper.
In the aggregate this is a daily occurrence, and as a conse-
quence, the total of undesirables in proportion to the number
of births, is greater than ever.

world, that marriage brings with it the responsibilities of
parentage'.
There can be no love without passion. It is self-evident that
when the average wedded pair exercise the creative function
and results do not become apparent, there must be a weakness
or abuse somewhere in the relationship. There are many con-
traceptions, but none of them are absolutely certain; and as
previously stated, many of them are detrimental to the well-
being of those participating. If the instructions we have perused
and reported as coming from the Birth Control advocates are
authentic, then it would be far better for the moral spiritual
welfare of the average man and woman to continue in their
former manner of life and have children than to damn them-
selves body and Soul.
Seeking the pleasure of frequent indulgence, but hoping to
avoid the penalty, my lady accidently doth conceive. Her mind
is constantly on the thought of not wanting the child; impress-
ing this on the child's mentality, thus preventing a normal
development of the mental faculties, while also interfering with
the natural bodily growth; with the result that the one born is
either mentally defective, physically perverted or becomes a
moral leper.
In the aggregate this is a daily occurrence, and as a conse-
quence, the total of undesirables in proportion to the number
of births, is greater than ever.

RACE REGENERATION
271
Sanger's much-quoted statement was made, insanity, immorality,
degeneracy, rape and moral depravity have increased enor-
mously; so much so that they threaten the race. Birth Control
as a remedy for these evils of the REgeneration of the race has
wholly failed and Mrs. Sanger and her clique have proven to
be false prophets.
Speaking from a spiritual standpoint, we repeat that, with
exceptions, any prevention of conception not based on the
sterile period of the woman between lunar periods, or the
failure of the uterus to "draw in" the seminal fluids, due
to a side embrace or some other natural means, is a per-
version and the woman—and her progeny—always pay.
For centuries, by one means or another, but generally through
cults having at heart the bestial (with apologies to the beasts)
sexual debasement of mankind, much after the fashion of those
rampant in Sodom, Gomorrah, Babylon, Greece and Rome, the
race has been periodically guilty of race suicide.
To this has been added, as a result of wars, the appalling loss
of possibly 35,000,000 of Aryans or "white" men, who should
have become the fathers of sturdy progeny. Another war, es-
pecially if the non-white races combine against the white, aided
by the present destructive machinery, and the white race will
be a thing of the past except in the markets for slaves.
Following this, the more war-natured of these races, such as
the Mongolian, Tartar and others, will turn upon races less
war-like, such as the Negro and East Indian, and either wipe
them out or enslave them.
Thinkers have long feared this and it will come about unless,
as Tolstoy said: The white man will bethink himself and begin
to live naturally, constructively and within reason.

MYSTERY OF SEX
Formerly, there appeared little to fear. The darker races did
not possess either the initiative or the aggressiveness of the
white. Over-population was chronic with some of them, but
they were held in check by plagues, pestilence, and famine;
totally ignorant of the means to combat the reaper; all these
keeping them in check.
Now it is vastly different. The white race has discovered
the means of overcoming disease, and has taught the methods
to its colored brothers; awakening in them also the desire for
conquest. Slowly but surely, they are now overcoming all the
forces which formerly held them in subjection. The population
of many races is increasing so rapidly that emigration is becom-
ing larger and larger; and sooner or later, whether we will or
not, the crisis must be faced.
As previously stated, the population of the world is about
one-third white, heretofore a race of progression and aggression,
while the colored races were sleeping the sleep of inertia. Now
they are waking to their possibilities and beginning to work in
unison, while the white race is becoming inoculated with per-
versia sexualisis; a desire for all the pleasures of indulgence
while seeking to avoid natural results; stooping to every known
manner of beastly practices in order to avoid conception; and
to this is added the internal struggle of man against man. Woe
to those who will not heed the writing in the sky.
We emphatically declare that we do not condemn a man
because he smokes, imbibes what seems pleasing to him, or
wears silken socks or shirts. We would not look askance at a
woman if she likes her candies and creams, and prefers the
fineries to the commonplace and essential. We do not advocate
the restriction of any races.

Valuable Information to Further
Human Welfare
"We that live to serve, must serve to live"
—Samuel Johnson
During the first world war, human welfare, proper diet
and methods for maintaining health were of prime impor-
tance.
Because of this need, a group of men and women organized
The Humanitarian Society, Reg., on a non-profit basis, offer-
ing a free advisory service to all who requested information
on the following subjects:
1. The selection and combination of foods to eliminate
physical weakness and maintain perfect health.
2. The prevention of sex diseases and the preservation
of sex purity.
3. Instructions to both parents and youths in the Laws
governing sex and the creation of babies much above
the average in physical and mental perfection.
4. The education of prospective parents in methods
and practices necessary to bring about an improve-
ment in the human race as a whole.
This service was, and continues to be rendered on a volun-
tary basis. There were and are no requests for fees. All ex-
penses were covered by donations on the part of the organizers,
and contributions by those who volunteered their support in
appreciation for the service rendered.
