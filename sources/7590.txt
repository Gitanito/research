  		              		Experience Description   

    After losing control of my car, I went completely unconscious.  

  I then had an OBE and watched my car hit the  guard rail head-on from moving into  the oncoming side of the highway. The impact was estimated to be at between 35-40mph and the impact was violent enough to snap the rear axle of my car.  The impact  tore chunks out of my stainless alloy front wheels. After watching my car impact from above, I had a life review. The only things I remember  were my elementary school playground and playing on my grandmother's porch when I was young. I could tell that I was younger because I was small in terms of  height. I saw how I looked in relation to the size of the banister and furniture. After the life review, I woke up.  

   My car was on its side, in a ditch on the original side of the road. After impact, my car had skidded back across the highway; much in the same fashion as a puck in a game of air hockey would have done since the roads were  icy. I still remember everything in vivid detail that happened immediately afterwards. I even remember the  song playing when I regained consciousness. Doctors later told me that being unconscious might have save my life due to the speed of the impact and my airbags not deploying.

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?         Slightly compassionate toward others  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     The Life Review seemed to be very peaceful and full of places that I enjoyed/loved.  

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     It opened a door to a spiritual/energetic realm that I didn't know existed. I've had many encounters since that time. Some were more profound than my NDE and others were  far scarier than my accident.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain Couldn't say to be honest.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The emotional impact of it was very extreme.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I basically remember the entire hour after regaining consciousness. I, however, have very little memories of other events around that same time.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I tap into the spiritual world randomly. Sometimes it's pure bliss and enlightening, other times it's been completely hellish. It doesn't happen very often but it has steadily happened since my NDE. I've since learned to tap into this realm to make art with very  little cognitive awareness of what's happening creatively until it's finished  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Still sometime I think about the experience quite regularly and I've tried rationalizing it with skeptics' theories and haven't been able to whatsoever.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Immediately afterward. They reacted with complete shock/disbelief. No, it sounds ridiculous to me even still, so I'm not surprised.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I was really intrigued by the Life Review aligning with the old adage that your life flashes before you right before you die. That, more so than the OBE, was what caused me to go looking for answers.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Just as crazy as I did back then but more validated after learning about how it happens to others.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I study psychology and often wonder what the long-term effects are on mental health and whether this is positive or negative. I could see how depending on the implications and intensity of the experience, it could actually cause depression and anxiety or quite possibly even cure such neuroses.
