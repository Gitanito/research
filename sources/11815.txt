  		              		Experience Description   

  Weeks before the event, I had this foreboding that something major was going to happen to me, but I did not know what. Saturday morning 10:00 AM, my brother-in-law, his friend, myself and my 3-year old daughter, drove to the hardware shop. We needed to buy insecticide to spray on the garden plants that seem to have an infection. The shop was at a busy traffic light intersection corner. I carried my daughter and all of us went into the shop, but they did not have the product we were looking for.  My brother-in-law suggested that we cross the street to another shop down the road to look for the product. I was feeling uneasy  but decided to go on condition that my brother-in-law carries my daughter. Off the four of us went.  While crossing the street to the shop diagonally across the road, I walked in front of a mini-bus taxi that struck me from behind.
    
    Please note that what I next describe is vivid in my mind but I find it difficult to describe because of a lack of words. Also, English is my second language. 

    Next, I was standing on the sidewalk looking at myself lying in the road. My brother-in-law was on his knees at my side in the road. He seemed very upset, to the point that he seems to be crying. I had this very euphoric feeling and could not understand. Everything was so colorful.  I could see all round myself at once depending on where my attention focused. It was not blinding and hot as summer normally was, everything was just right;  except, where was my daughter? Not really all that anxious, I found myself next to her. She was safely with my brother-in-law's friend and I had no worries about that any further.

    Then I felt  a feeling of unease coming from a gentleman standing next to me. This  clashed with my very euphoric feeling.  He was worriedly looking at me lying in the street. I tried to reassure him that I am fine by talking to him, but he did not seem to hear me.  I then put my hand out to touch his shoulder and found that my hand went right through him. By now there was a small crowd on the sidewalk, all anxiously looking  at me, lying in the street. I noticed an older lady carrying a pink pillow and a very colorful patterned blanket. She was hurrying from one of the buildings, towards me lying in the street. I could not understand why everybody was making such a fuss since  I was OK and  could not have feel better.

    It could be that what happened next, actually happened first.  I found myself in a dark tunnel like a  vortex. I was  moving fast towards a small point of light at the one end of this vortex. There were no one else near me and I felt quite relaxed speeding towards this light. As I progressively got closer to this light, it became bigger and bigger. I was getting  brighter and brighter, like a massive sun but without hurting my eyes. I had a very euphoric feeling that was further fueled by the feeling of love emanating from this light. I was  drawn towards this love, like a moth to a candle. This is not humanly describable, very difficult, sorry. It was complete, penetrating, love, understanding, acceptance. The light communicated telepathically with me, indicating that I am very welcome but it is not my time to be here yet. It was authoritative but with a sense of loving humor. It did not come to me that this was GOD. It seemed to be  a higher Being, but not  Jesus. It was so natural. We discussed my life while I relived, portions of it. We reviewed my life  proceeding from oldest to younger events and only stopping when I seem to be uncertain of my own actions at the time. There was no condemnation and no right or wrong. There was complete acceptance and understanding with only one loving comment, 'Don't you think you could have done it this way?' I was judging myself.

    I was not given the option to stay there. The  light entity lovingly informed me,   'You have to go back now.' I protested, indicating that I had only arrived and needed to know more. Then  firmly with  humor the light said, 'There are some more things you have to go and do still, you must go now.' Rather upset, I asked, 'Please explain what still must be done?' The final loving, humorous and understanding comment from this indescribable entity,  'It will be made clear to you as you go on in your life'    and that was it. 

    My brother-in-law confirmed that I momentarily woke up in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and passed out again before arriving there. Four days later,  I awoke in hospital. It took months to get back to where I could really say, 'Hello world, I am back and feeling normal.'

    God, Spiritual and Religion:         

    What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?         Slightly important to me    

    What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant.   I was a Chief Deacon at church and very active in organized religion. I was responsible for final year classes of new members confessions.    

    Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Major changes, religion does not work for me anymore. Please understand that I will tolerate religion only for the sake and respect of friends and family, they may need it now and will outgrow it, I believe.    

    What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?         Greatly important to me    

    What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant.   I gradually grew distant from organized religion and left the church. I realized that I should study what happened to me on my own to keep my sanity and not succumb to depression. I found that the church and 'learned friends' could not help me. It was  a very difficult and depressing time for me afterwards. My religious view changed completely, reincarnation is first-most, GOD is in All and All is GOD. Creation is MIND and energy.    

    Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I did believe in life after death, but not as it unfolded. The Church says you die and go to a place of rest and on the last day will be woken and be judged. It is definitely not like that.    

    Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Gradually grew distant from organized religion and left the church. Reincarnation makes sense. GOD is in All and All is GOD. Creation is MIND and energy. I am not materialistic any more. I believe in live and let live. I have no fear of death and look forward to it. Every one is on their path, so I don't judge others. I  love more and let others know the truth. The truth shall set you free. I had an urge for knowledge after my return.  I have  stronger faith in God and my neighbor. I am  more sensitive to what others are thinking (mind reading) and more sensitive to light (glare). I have warm hands. I seem to have more static electricity so have to be careful with electronics, PC, Ham Radios etc. There are many more changes. My wife and kids are of the opinion that I changed into a wise old saint.    

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   This is not humanly describable, very difficult, sorry. It was complete, penetrating, love, understanding, acceptance. The light communicated telepathically with me, indicating that I am very welcome but it is not my time to be here yet. It was authoritative but with a sense of loving humor. It did not come to me that this was GOD. It seemed to be  a higher Being, but not  Jesus. It was so natural. We discussed my life while I relived, portions of it. We reviewed my life  proceeding from oldest to younger events and only stopping when I seem to be uncertain of my own actions at the time. There was no condemnation and no right or wrong. There was complete acceptance and understanding with only one loving comment, 'Don't you think you could have done it this way?' I was judging myself.    

    Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No

    Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?         God definitely exists

    During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No         

    Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         I was uncertain if an afterlife exists    

    Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists     No

    What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I gradually grew distant from organized religion and left the church. I realized that I should study what happened to me on my own to keep my sanity and not succumb to depression. I found that the church and 'learned friends' could not help me. It was  a very difficult and depressing time for me afterwards. My religious view changed completely, reincarnation is first-most, GOD is in All and All is GOD. Creation is MIND and energy.    

    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I myself changed so much for the good that it automatically changed my relationships at home and at work.    

    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It is difficult and tiring to describe this due to a lack of words and bbecause English not  my first language.    

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This happend more than 40 years ago and I was allowed remember information as if it is today. The reason a say allowed to remember information because I am sure that a lot more happened but I cannot recall this.    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     When someone near or in the family is going to die, I most often times will know beforehand that something is going to happen but not to whom. I will sometimes know what someone is going to say before they say it. Lots of times I walk to the telephone before it starts ringing.    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          That I lost my fear of death. I know   that there is no judgment and hellfire. 

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It took me a long time, a couple of years, to first share it with my wife. She did not react negatively but stayed neutral, suggesting that I discuss my  problems with my pastor or  doctor. I did that and decided not to talk to anyone again about this after the negative reactions I got.    

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     There was no internet or  Google at that time, and living on the south tip of darkest Africa did not help either to collect information about what happened to me. Further to this I had strange things happen to me afterwards that confused me even more. While recuperating and afterwards I will go to bed and while sleeping wake up and find myself at the ceiling above, the dark room will have a blueish tinge. When I looked down, I saw myself and my wife on the bed sleeping. With shock, I will find myself back in my trembling body. This happened about three  times. To me this was real, as was the accident episode.  It is  part of the reason that I do not talk about this to anyone anymore. I could not care less what anyone else believes because I know what happened to me.    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real         

    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Only the OBEs that happened during sleep at night. These OBEs did not occur anymore after  a year or so.    

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         None, except that this was/is a journey and a happening in my life that I am so thankful for.  I would not change anything about it and I am privileged to have experienced it.    

    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Whoever had a hand in this, thank you! It is getting better and better and the breakthrough is just around the corner.
