  		              		Experience Description   

    Lower back surgery was sceduled for the morning of February 23, 2015.  I get there and was prepped for my surgery. I was scared and nervous, but it helped to  pray with the hospital priest and my wife. After a couple of hours, I went in for surgery. In my pillow case was a rosary, and pictures of my wife and 2 daughters. The  surgery took two and a half hours, after which, they took me to the recovery room. The surgeon spoke to my wife and told her that the surgery was a success. After a while, I woke up and they moved me to a different  room. The doctor and I spoke. He told me that I will hurt for a little bit but I can't have any pain medications, at all. I needed to build up a tolerance for the pain and that I was going to leave the next day. But before I left, I was going home with some equipment, a physical therapy treatment and a few other things. I was happy about all that. My surgeon and his team were amazing and knew exactly what they had to do. The nurses didn't pass the information about me not having pain medications to the next shift. So, after a couple hours of suffering with the excruciating pain, I asked my wife if she could get me a nurse. She does so and the nurse comes into the room. 

  I tell the nurse that I need something for the pain because I couldn't take it anymore. My wife told the nurse that I wasn't supposed to have any pain medications but the nurse didn't listen. She came back with  morphine and told me, 'When you see a green light come on in the machine, that means its ready to be used.' I replied, 'ok.' The nurse didn't put  the shut-off switch on the machine. The light kept turning green every couple minutes. Every time it turned green; I would shoot myself up with morphine. My wife noticed that I was turning blue. So she  went to get the nurse. By the time the nurse came to my room, I had coded and passed away. 

  I saw a tunnel with a white light at the end of it. I headed towards the light. That's when I saw my grandmother. We asked how each other was doing. I told her that I was married with two girls and that I was very happy. I told her that I was sorry for not being there for her last day on this planet. I told her that I miss and love her. She told me that she was looking over me and she was my guardian angel. I told her. 'Thank you.' She said, 'You have to go now.' I said, 'No, I want to stay with you.' She opened her arms and called me over for a hug.    When I went to go hug her and tell her that I love and miss her again, I woke up while taking a hard gasp of air. 

  My chest was on fire and my back was in ten times more pain than it was before. I saw my wife crying, so I begin to cry. The nurse went to get the priest. I also saw a cop standing by the door, so I begin to flip out. I couldn't tsay still in the hospital bed for about 20 to 25 minutes. The priest spoke to me. After a while, I begin to calm down. But I noticed that I had lost all feeling in my legs. My surgeon was called in and was chewing out the hospital staff. After everything  calmed down, I was sent to the ICU floor for treatment.

   I had to learn how to walk again. I also was attached to all types of machines and my doctor said that I wasn't leaving until I had a bowel movement. It took me a week to  to use the bathroom. I  had to learn how to get off the bed, because of the pain I was having from  the turning and twisting of my back. I went from staying overnight and going home, to staying for a week in the hospital. When I asked my wife what happen to me while I was gone, she told  me that I was blue in the face. She said I had  shot myself up about 52 times with morphine, then I passed away. The nurses and doctors came in and tried CPR on me and then they used the defibrillator. My heartbeat was very faint, so they hit me with some adrenaline. That's when my whole body jerked and I woke up. To this day I find it hard to understand why this has happen to me. The pain in my back has gotten worst since the whole situation. From time to time, I still lose feeling in my legs and can't walk.
