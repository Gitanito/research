  		              		Experience Description   

    I took myself down to the hospital. I was struggling to breathe and had swelling of the face and neck. Once there, I was rushed through to the resuscitation unit and placed on a bed. Within a few moments,  I went into life-threatening anaphylactic shock. 
  
  I was lying horizontally, in the same position as my body,  but was a few feet above the actual hospital bed.  I could see myself below, which was odd given that in my out of body state, I was facing tyhe ceiling.  I don't understand how I could see below me. There was an extremely intense, bright white light that had a whiteness  so brilliant. There was now a circle of medical staff around my hospital bed. They were putting  IV lines  in both arms. There was a lot of shouting and barking of orders. CPR was also being performed.
  
  Despite all the chaos going on below me, the 'second me' above my body was very happy, calm, relaxed and peaceful.  I did not feel anything when the IV ines were put in.  I did not feel anything when they were doing CPR.  But I could see it all happening. I felt no pain. The happiness and calmness I felt was in excess of anything I have felt before or since.  I knew everything would all be fine. I saw nothing else.
  
  When they stabilized my physical body,  I dropped back into it. I was discharged after a few hours and went back to work.   Eight hours later, I went back in to anaphylactic shock.  I did not have an experience that time and stayed  on the hospital bed the whole time there.  

  I have never before or subsequently suffered from anaphylaxis. 

  I have only told one person about this experience up until now. At the time, I assumed this was my body's response to ensure that I remained calm throughout the procedure, as panic may have only exacerbated the anaphylactic shock.     
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 2005  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Allergic Reaction.       Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   Anaphylactic shock  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      No.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I was able to observe and assimilate multiple things at the same time.  It was as though I had several sets of eyes and ears and a brain that could compute all this information simultaneously.  I know I can multi- task, but I have never been able to hear, see, and process so much information at the same time.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         It felt as if I was at my most alert during the out of body experience.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     For all the panic that was going on, I saw it all in slow motion.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I was able to see and assimilate everything that was going on all at once. My eyes were able to watch another staff member enter the room, the doctor who put the line in one arm,  the doctor who put the second line in, and the person writing down the doses - all at the same time. Everything was very clear. It was as though I had multiple pairs of eyes and ears all working together.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The sounds I heard sounded very distant, almost echo-like but strangely they were very clear.  I have a slight hearing deficit and am unable to follow group conversations because of this but during this experience, I was able to hear concurrent conversations and people speaking at the same time.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Intense, happiness, peace and calm.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     When you die do not be frightened as it is so peaceful.  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No

I think about other people's problems throughout the day. There is more to life than working all hours.  I now have a far better work/life balance.  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am less stressed, more compassionate, and more patient.  This has positively affected relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.  
  
After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It was as though I had become a super-human and was achieving the impossible.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I will never forget any of it.  It is a memory that never fades and the detail is incredible.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Death is peaceful.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It was about 14 years later when a friend's son had taken his own life. She was desperate to 'see' her son. I told her and explained why I believe in life after death.   It has given her an inner peace that one day she will see her son again.  I have not told anyone else until now.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     The fact that I knew the facts of what had happened to me even though I was 'gone' makes it real.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     The memory is not distant, it is as though it only happened yesterday. The years have not blurred it in any way.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         The happiest I have ever been.  This is despite having 3 amazing children and all the Happiness they bring.
