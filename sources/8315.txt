  		              		Experience Description   

    I had struggled with episodes of extremely rapid heartrate at a young age. At age 11, as I was standing up to leave band class, my heart shot into an extremely rapid heartrate, also known as 'supraventricular tachycardia.' I tried everything I could to get my heart to normal rhythm but eventually realized that an ambulance  needed to be called to get me to a hospital.
  
  My mom worked at my school at the time, so she joined me in the ambulance. The EMT gave me an IV and then began strapping down my body with the stretcher seatbelts that went  across my chest and legs. He eventually leaned over to whisper to my mom for a while and then pulled out a medication he said he was going to give me.  (Later, I learned the medication is called Adenosine and is nicknamed 'the medicine of doom'). 

  As he injected the Adenosine, he told me, 'In a minute you'll feel a little faint.' I can distinctly remember staring at the clock on the back upper wall of the ambulance. All of a sudden, my legs got VERY heavy. It felt like cement cans were along my legs and everything went dark. 

  Within what felt like a second's time, my nose was up against the clock that was hanging on the upper back wall of the ambulance. I could hear loud screaming around me and turned to look down at my body.  My mom and the EMT were looking over me. One moment later, I was back inside my body looking up at my mom. I asked her immediately, 'Mom, why were you screaming so loud?' She responded, 'I wasn't the one screaming. You were'. To this day, I know that I left my human body behind.  I know I  heard the screaming while I was outside of my body.  I saw  the clock right against my face and remember turning around to see myself.  
  
Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 March 1, 1999  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes         Medication-induced heart attack to stop my rapid heart rate. Medication used is called Adenosine.   Life threatening event, but not clinical death.  At the time of this experience, my heart had been in supraventricular tachycardia for well over 30 minutes and it was necessary to administer a self-induced heart attack via medicine to bring the heart back to normal rhythm.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness   

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I would say when I could see the clock up close and hear very loud screaming.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My vision seemed a bit more blurred than my every day vision.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Technically my hearing was working very well because the screaming was SO loud. I heard the screaming when I was outside of my body.
