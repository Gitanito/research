Coming out of the elevator I looked up at the ceiling at a reflection of myself and I was smiling I thought it was odd. I remember feeling very tired and wanting to go to sleep. Then I remember feeling like I was dreaming, but it didn't look like a normal dream. It was all black and white, grey, and blurry. I was in what seemed to be a school hallway with just people moving every which way like a crowded subway station in front of me. To the left was an archway that was the bright part of the scene. To the right and behind me I could feel the darkness. I remember hearing two real loud buzzing sounds like an alarm. I remember thinking to myself there was something I was doing that was important and I shouldn't be sleeping. I opened my eyes to see a bunch of doctors all around and telling them I was sorry and I was trying to stay awake. That is when the doctor told me I died and they had to shock me twice.
