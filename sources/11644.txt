My stepfather and mother, who were entertaining Clarence and Sue downstairs, frantically raced up the steps. In a panic Pat, my stepfather, scooped my body up out of the bed. 

Down the staircase, they raced as I calmly watched from the ceiling, first of the bedroom then the hallway. Then my spirit moved to the south window in the bedroom as I watched my parents rush to the station wagon in the driveway. Pat of course handed me to mom and ran around to drive. I watched the car back out of the driveway and onto the paved street. My spirit then moved to the east window and I could see the car race north to the hospital. While everyone was rushing about me, my spirit was at peace, calm, and somewhat curious. As spirit, I had no legs, but that caused no panic. I was flying and that caused no panic. Everyone else was going nuts and that caused no panic.
