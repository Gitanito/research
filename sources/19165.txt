a quick trip through some of the
experiences we&#39;ve had with close
encounters of the fifth kind are we good
to go
Neil Lance okay and to describe it now
that we&#39;ve gone through this material
you can begin to understand why the
techniques and the protocols that we&#39;re
using are effective well let me connect
a few dots before we go into this next
section we&#39;re going to show a bunch of
images if you understand that an
interstellar civilization have mastered
the science of consciousness and their
interface with technologies it&#39;s not
hard to figure out that if you enter
into an expanded state of consciousness
can remote view their location or sense
where they are and then with a coherent
intent show them or invite them to come
visit they will and the reason it&#39;s not
magic and it&#39;s not tinfoil hat stuff
it&#39;s because the technologies that have
been developed over thousands and
millions of years and some of them when
you get to the level eight nine-ten
those are in the neighborhood of 1
billion earth years advance from where
we are technologically billion with a B
so you have civilizations that have
capabilities that as arthur c clarke
said any civilization sufficiently
advanced to get here from another star
system everything that they would have
would look like magic to us but let&#39;s go
back in time to the time of Thomas
Jefferson and the late 1700s early 1800s
this would be magic the idea that you
could have a device like this or on your
wristwatch Dick Tracy or and be seeing
someone or having you know do what
FaceTime or video conferencing or
streaming from something like this would
be absolutely unimaginable and would be
something from another world
more than likely you&#39;d be burned at the
stake as
witch or warlock or something so we have
to have some humility about the fact
that our civilization in terms of the
dominant disclosed paradigm of
Technology and science is really based
in the 1800s
cellphones linear electromagnetic
systems at this that are speed of light
or less that&#39;s mid to late 1800s
internal combustion engines late 1800s
coal-fired power plants late 1800s Early
1900s even your atomic energy nuclear
energy plants you&#39;re splitting an atom
creating a lot of heat the turn of a
turbine steam turbine like a choo-choo
train going across coming out west here
in the 1860s that&#39;s all it is
you&#39;re not be a lot of people think
you&#39;re getting electricity from the atom
you&#39;re not you&#39;re just boiling water
that&#39;s all at Tomic a nuclear plan is so
our paradigm is locked in late 1800s up
to but no further than 1945 and
everything else is tinkering around the
edges now if now extrapolate what our
civilization would be like had there
been disclosure of sort of
transdimensional physics early
experiments and electromagnetic
levitation systems from the 20 from T
Townsend Brown etc and so on and so
forth we would have eliminated poverty
had no pollution had a stable you know
Malthusian crisis would be fixed was he
with the abundance would come universal
education women wouldn&#39;t be chattel they
wouldn&#39;t be having twelve children
against their will and you would have a
stabilized population and an advanced
civilization with no pollution and no
poverty within twenty to thirty forty
years so all of this is possible
theoretically but only within the
paradigm of peace and the policy
discussions I&#39;ve had with Air Force guys
and CIA guys is that do you understand
how powerful these technologies are
because if they are in the wrong hands
it could destroy this planet I say yes
of course
it is in the hands of the wrong people
already and we are destroying the planet
so there is we&#39;re on the horns of a
dilemma here we need to go forward or we
slide down and that&#39;s that&#39;s this
difficulty of 0 to 1 transition we have
to make this transition happen and it
will I&#39;m confident it will one way or
another but in the meanwhile we need to
understand that these civilizations that
are observing the planet are concerned
about where we are and where we&#39;re
headed and those civilizations have been
around for anywhere from a six-digit
hundred thousand to a billion years
longer than we have so there are
technological capabilities the minimum
of them is that they have an interface
with coherent thought field coming from
expanded consciousness and so the
evolution of the Close Encounters of the
fifth kind techniques happened about six
months after I had my near-death
experience I was sitting I was up in
North Carolina up in the mountains and
the Blue Ridge Mountains up above this
little town of Boone North Carolina out
in the boondocks and I there was a
forest service road that was closed at
the bottom you could hike up to this
little over 5,000 foot high mountain
called Rich&#39;s Mountain at the top of
which was a fire tower this fire tower
in Norton Carolina II so I hiked up to
the far tar and went up there to
meditate so I said well that&#39;s what they
call it a fart are
lovely so I was sitting at the base of
this thing in it I was getting ready to
do a meditation I looked out to the
southwest and there was this seamless
beautiful disc-shaped ET craft and
materialized this is the same craft I
saw when I was 8 or 9 that got me
interested in all this when I was a
young child knew it was the same I said
oh well they&#39;re back I didn&#39;t think
anything more about I&#39;m 18 year old guy
I sit down I&#39;m doing the meditation and
because I go into this deep deep deep
Samadhi meditation with a mantra I was
using and time pet there was no time
it&#39;s just like I was in this state of
just unbounded mind and then at the end
I came out of meditation it got very
dark it had gone from sunset to just
pitch you know and that&#39;s quite a while
this was October 73 and I&#39;m looking and
this look up at the stars and I see the
entire Milky Way galaxy you know how you
see it and a thought came in that said
behold what a beautiful universe God has
made and with that I went straight into
the Brahman consciousness and unity
consciousness that state I was in when I
died but I was now in my physical body
so oh this is nice
beautiful beautiful beautiful and then I
realized there was this thing I didn&#39;t
know what it was a creature that in my
little you know 18 year old mind what
was in so little but I didn&#39;t have the
experience I thought it was a deer
standing on standing upright and had
beautiful deer like eyes and it came
over and touched me on my right shoulder
I was wearing a ski Jack and I saw it in
dent but I then it kind of Dee
materialized and I had this
electrostatic field all over me and my
hair stood on in and that&#39;s when I had
hair it was long hair this was 73 you
have to be there and so and so bang and
I vanished so I sort of dematerialize
and and went on to a ET craft for the
next three or four hours and what we
were doing together we were meditating
to
in this state of deep consciousness and
Samadhi and I was sharing with them the
experience as a human experiencing
Samadhi and Brahman conscious higher
consciousness and then we co-created
this technique where one could connect
to consciousness then remote-view space
find where the ET craft are and then the
vector the men like you&#39;re guiding a
aircraft on the runway at San Francisco
Airport or someplace but using coherent
thought thought that&#39;s very stream of
consciousness very clear like a laser is
coherent light very coherent thought and
show them where you are
and show them where you are on the earth
and invite them to come within the
ethical construct of universal peace and
the oneness of conscious intelligence
that is the base foundation of universal
relations between humans and non-human
civilizations and that&#39;s the state of
universality which is the state of pure
consciousness which happily is folded
within all of us that&#39;s the beauty of
this this is already everything we need
is already there so this experience
lasted for quite some time and I had no
idea how much time went by and it was
really beautiful
it was very abstract what did you talk
about but we&#39;re not having bagels and
lox and talking about politics it was it
was direct contact and experience based
on deep transcendent consciousness and
packets of knowledge that are pre verbal
and pre visual so I want to explain what
I mean by that
you have consciousness that&#39;s unbounded
within us information can be obtained
you can sometimes just get the word in a
meditative remote view or see a remote
place but more elemental to that is
knowingness
it&#39;s a packet of knowledge and there is
actually something in the Vedas called
the in Sanskrit the Ritambhara Pragya
the level of written
we&#39;re in the fine structure of
consciousness that you can know anything
or know any one thing now the great beam
knows all things at all times but an
individual can access rip Tom but
knowledge can also come to you and you
can communicate at that level that is
pre visual and pre verbal so example I
can say the word the word writ over two
words red apple in your mind you can see
a red apple but inside the meaning of
that word and the image of it is the
essence of what that is the knowledge of
what that is and it sounds abstract that
level of communication happens a lot and
then you get a knowledge at that level
and then it unfolds into an image or it
unfolds into a word or a sentence but
the primary is at that level and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re doing all the time we&#39;re
communicating we&#39;re actually words or a
symbol for something that is meaning and
then what is the meaning but we never
think about we never deconstruct what&#39;s
happening but that can happen at an
interstellar level or interspecies level
you can do it with dolphins you can do
it with your dog then you can do it with
fellow humans and you can do it with
interstellar civilizations the
interesting thing is interstellar
civilizations happen to have
technologies that interface with that
strata of conscious intelligence thought
stuff does that make sense and
seamlessly so in our Close Encounters of
the fifth kind process we enter into
meditative States and go into deep
meditation when we&#39;re very centered and
calm then allow ourselves to see a
remote view where any ET craft or people
or planets are and we&#39;re just whatever
you&#39;re drawn to at that point you
connect to them and then invite them to
be in and we say that we are an
ambassador from Earth to your people and
we&#39;re here in peace and universal peace
with the foundation of which is that
we&#39;re experiencing the clear light of
unbounded - a singularity
and cause the light of consciousness for
humming from their eyes and the light of
consciousness from our eyes that is a
singularity the total number of minds in
the universe is one so once you
understand that and you&#39;re in that state
exponentially but also ethically there
are no aliens that&#39;s why our motto is
one universe one people there&#39;s actually
one okay so one universe one people is
our motto so when you&#39;re in that state
and you&#39;re beyond the fear state you&#39;re
not afraid of them because as Arjuna was
told by creation on the battlefield a
little of this capital T meaning this
pure state of consciousness eliminates
all fear that&#39;s the other beautiful
thing about a group meditation you
transcend let&#39;s call it our animal
fight-or-flight nature and get into this
aspect of yourself that&#39;s immortal
eternal unbounded infinite so in that
state the drop of us yourself becomes
the ocean and as the drop is united with
the ocean or let&#39;s say a wave on the
surface of the ocean you might be where
wave or ripple is connected to the whole
ocean that is infinite then you have no
fear that&#39;s the Shambhala warrior state
that&#39;s the state of fearlessness that&#39;s
spoken about in spiritual traditions
it&#39;s one reason why I&#39;m not afraid I
mean you know you just go there but so
when you&#39;re in that state then you can
your nervous system and your mind
consciousness everything can withstand
the strangeness which is can be strange
of contact that happens on multiple
dimensions from other star systems okay
it&#39;s really important to understand that
the the the technique of meditation and
being centered in that state isn&#39;t just
philosophical it&#39;s an operational system
that is the prerequisite to being close
encounters of the fifth kind ambassador
to these other civilizations and the
reason I called it close encounters of
the fifth kind there were other four
other categories previously described
prior to 1990 when I founded this
project and of course close encounter of
the first kind is a sighting at fairly
close
of acrimony ET craft or UFO close
encounter the second kind is when it
leaves some sort of physical evidence
when it&#39;s landed close encountered a
third kind you remember Steven
Spielberg&#39;s movie isn&#39;t it contact with
an actual extraterrestrial being close
encountered a fifth kind is when people
Fourth Kind is when people have
experienced going on board or a craft a
close errant of fifth kind is the first
category where the human initiates the
contact all right in other words it&#39;s no
longer a passive paradigm it&#39;s an active
paradigm very big jump by the way
between passively seen touching or going
and actively inviting with full
consciousness of why you&#39;re doing it now
the key thing is to do it within this
for the purpose not some selfish reason
oh I want to see one to be entertained
like you go to SeaWorld and see dolphins
that kind of thing that&#39;s the wrong
mindset they&#39;re not interested in
immature souls that way the interest
would be in people who are doing it for
coming together as a people to move us
from a level zero to a level one to a
level two to a level 4 to level eight
civilization understanding this is the
trajectory of the next half a million
years of human evolution on planet Earth
so doing it for the correct purpose that
isn&#39;t self-centered narcissistic etc is
very important not to say you&#39;re not
curious not to say you don&#39;t have
personal interest you should but it&#39;s
that shouldn&#39;t be the be in all of it
they shouldn&#39;t be everything does that
make sense so then when you&#39;re in that
state and you practice this technique in
protocol which on our website serious
disclosure calm si RI us disclosure calm
we have you know meditation tapes
training all the training materials is
there and we have an app you can go to
the either iPhone or Google store and
there&#39;s an app you can download that
takes you through all the meditations
and all the techniques and we you know
it&#39;s great because we&#39;ve had people I
got a Croatian truck driver write us
last year or maybe your before and he
had the app never had met me personally
he was a try and pulled over to a rest
place that was in the mouth
and did the that turned on the app and
did the meditation and an
extraterrestrial vehicle materializing
came right over a struck we have
thousands of reports like this so what
I&#39;m saying is it works it&#39;s not
difficult to do you just have to do it
with a pure heart with the right
intention without fear and just go into
that flow consciousness it&#39;s really very
easy to do so that&#39;s what we do it I
train people to do that we just got back
from Mount Shasta where we were up there
for a week with with a group of people
about 23 people but that&#39;s something you
can do at home you can do it with a
small team of people it&#39;s easier if it&#39;s
smaller three four five six people the
more people you have the harder it is to
get into coherence and then the more ego
conflicts there are excedrin and so on
because we&#39;re still part kind of like
primates the monkey mind you know troops
tribes ego all that but you can you know
it&#39;s easier to get that coherence in a
small group than a larger group unless
the group is very evolved so I recommend
a smaller group approach like-minded
people do it with joy do it with the
right intention go someplace where you
know you and the craft won&#39;t be shot at
by somebody if possible that&#39;s a big
issue we&#39;ve had it happen and we just
had a inside invasion up at Mount Shasta
by three people the last night we were
there two nights ago so mainly cuz the
word got out I was in town it was just
ridiculous you know you lose all you
lose your life when you do this you lose
your privacy you lose your career you
lose everything well but I did it
knowingly anyway radec that the the
point I&#39;m making is it&#39;s it&#39;s very
easily attainable and why because that
conscious field that&#39;s within you if you
go into quiet meditation you can
experience this pure quiet mind and you
have to have full samadhi just centered
quiet consciousness and when you&#39;re in
that place intend to see and intend to
know and a knowingness or a vision may
come connect them to that ET
world civilization person whatever it is
and introduce yourself and somewhat with
you know clarity humility invite them to
where you are and and know but you need
to also put out there you can appear in
any way that is safe and appropriate for
this time in place very important
because the entire earth is surrounded
by killer satellites just had a briefing
I was read into a whole series of
state-of-the-art systems that have been
put up
they&#39;ve been operational in some form or
another since 1965 that can track and
target these ET crafts when they come
out of transdimensional space-time into
3d they send off a type of neutrino
light even when they&#39;re not fully
materialized yet and that can be tracked
and when they come into 3d they&#39;re hit
with the electromagnetic pulse weapons
and so-called scalar longitudinal
weapons and that&#39;s why so many have been
knocked down there have been hundreds of
of kills of ET craft and those are on
their land and sea and air and space on
satellites that are have these systems
that can obliterate anything in space by
the way those are fully operational so
you have to have the understanding that
they are operating in a very in the
military say a hostile theater of
operations a very dangerous place the
world right now because we haven&#39;t
attained level one civilization we&#39;re
very much at a level zero classified
projects we had a man on our team who
was a partners for 30 years and he had
one of the doctors with a colonel that
he worked with in surgery and this issue
came up with and he just asked a colonel
he said you know if you had one of these
craft come and land what what are you
instructed to do he says we killed them
he said we just shoot him kill him flat
out so that&#39;s the order that&#39;s the world
and the technologies that have developed
since the 40s and 50s - now I don&#39;t have
time to go into I&#39;ve gone into in the
last two workshops I&#39;ve done
the Phoenix one in May and the boulder
one in June I can&#39;t go through all that
again that&#39;s eight more hours of
discussion but those are fully
operational and developed and and so
just do this within the construct of
knowing that you need to invite these
civilizations to appear at this time in
history in ways that may not be a Steven
Spielberg movie landing but it may be it
depends on what&#39;s being monitored how
they slipped in and everyone asked why
don&#39;t they just go ahead and twitch
those systems off could they of course
but that would be taken by the
intelligence community and this sort of
covert group as proof of their hostility
there if I figured this out with my
meager IQ they have really figured this
out go zoom we were talking
civilizations equivalent human IQ is
four or five hundred in that range so
that&#39;s you know I&#39;m the equivalent of a
Down syndrome not even myself personally
so I not you know but you&#39;re they
figured this out they don&#39;t want to push
that envelope because it will be used in
a counterintelligence spin and there&#39;s
enough of that going on already with us
ology and all the fear-mongering and
lunatic fringe out there in the skies
falling and they&#39;re kicking us in a blah
blah blah you know it&#39;s funny because I
met with since the 90s I&#39;ve been meeting
with guys who have been on the abduction
squads that get on these Lockheed Martin
and Northrop anti-gravity craft with
these little creatures that are program
life-forms it looked like aliens that go
and abduct people they&#39;ve been going on
and they have electronic systems that
knock people out in chemical systems
well yeah what you guys whatever you
think you know about this subject erase
put it in a put it in a side and then
let&#39;s go forward because very limited on
anticipation designed to make people
afraid to create a new enemy and the
means for doing that were developed in
the 1950s and have been deployed since
the
to 50s so be very careful what you think
are facts that are ascribed to
extraterrestrial because a great deal of
it our counterintelligence operations
for psychological warfare value from
people who want to create the foundation
of fear separation conflict so that the
next conflict would be interplanetary as
Douglas MacArthur said in 1950 bleed 55
World War 3 will be interplanetary now
that whole decision-making process that
happened between 45 and 55 is what the
mess were living through now and that
post-world War 2 era I&#39;m not going to
get into a whole deconstruction of the
last 75 years I know it from the inside
out from people whose families are
involved and have been involved with the
intelligence community since 1945 but I
prefer rustics stay positive here and go
into this next understanding I&#39;m just
giving you this as a cautionary tale
that not everything that goes bump in
the night is extraterrestrial and the
intelligence community have technologies
to simulate alien events that are very
effective and so don&#39;t bring out under
the stars with your people this paradigm
of division and fear that is a sort of a
programmable brainwashing probe system
that&#39;s been operational since the 50s
and we&#39;ve all everyone in this room has
lived up and lived in a culture of
movies and video games and books and
things that are designed to just trap
your mind in that paradigm of fear and
division
so as the envogue group free yo mind
which I love that song we should have a
plane boom boom oh that&#39;s a great you
know that song free youma love it
alright so now let&#39;s go to look at some
images I&#39;m just going to take you on a
quick trip this is uh if you want to dim
the light so it&#39;s more visible we can
now these are incandescent I know you
need these
klieg lights for filming is that better
yeah so this is an object that came in
from we a team member who is in Wichita
Falls and this exact craft was a
seamless has sort of a aperture here
these strange structures coming off of
it he was doing a CT v and this floated
in and materialize and dematerialize and
it was sort of a reconnaissance vehicle
I got from the French Ministry of
Defense a drawing of almost the exact
same thing of a sighting in the 60s in
France of this area next and this was a
daytime ce-5 event a member of our team
IV Blanc and New Mexico was doing these
protocols and she was outside Santa Fe
she felt she didn&#39;t see anything she
felt it because these are usually
phasing and moving at speeds the eye the
human eye can&#39;t see by the way she took
a picture there&#39;s this seamless disc
domed disc that appeared about 30 feet
wide moving about 500 miles an hour that
it came in and zipped in and around Oh
am I in your way where can I be Oh Oh
see I need that city where I become
transparent I&#39;ve had it happen
well can I no can you guys see okay I
can still see can the camera guys see I
hope you don&#39;t like being in the film
next this is one of my favorite just
happened about nine years ago eight and
a half years ago exhaust Rapinoe Park
this is an interstellar ambassador has
sort of a telex like a Yamaka
teleportation thing as wear yarmulkes
came from by the way on the on his head
this is an eye that&#39;s a nice weren&#39;t
sweat night-vision goggles his nose is
lit up he has a very fine mouth has a
receding forehead like I do and hair
this is his well this is his right hand
his left hand
and he was floating you&#39;ll see the
original picture in a moment outside
there was a orb that had come right
beside my shoulder and this is not a
human light this is a transdimensional
light and this beam appeared partially
in this environment the wings
it looks like wings it&#39;s not it&#39;s the
teleportation transdimensional energy
that when you did the contrast you can
see so this is his head his chest waist
one leg the other leg the other arm and
nothing was seen with the eyes but we
heard four or five ETS after this orb
appeared beside my right shoulder
speaking right outside our circle they
were you could hear him talking not
English I don&#39;t know what they were
speaking Andromedan because they were
from andromeda galaxy they told us and
then one of our team members literally
held her breath and took a picture not
on a tripod and got this picture from
where these four or five ETS were
speaking most people heard all females I
heard one male and it was this gentleman
who told me his name was Bijou and from
Andromeda and very very connected very
high ambassador probably a level seven
to mmm eight civilization from the
andromeda galaxy so this is a picture of
it looked just the contrast turned up a
little bit you can see the chairs and
where he is and this is where you you
know we cut it out so you can show look
at the size of his head from his eye oh
can you I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening
here there&#39;s a hit from his hid from his
eyes up is about three to four times our
cranial vault right and the front of his
head have these warlike Worf have these
indented concave areas here and here are
two concave areas on the front of the
skull and as this is his head this is
his chest this is it legs and his arm
and he has like night-vision goggles or
glasses on his lip is right there very
fine
lip ah but he does have hair looks could
almost look human not quite but similar
to a human and very very highly
intelligent I asked him I was sensing
his consciousness and intelligence and a
very high state of enlightenment and IQ
and in the 450 range around 450 that
range next no we just saw that next so
this are just some examples going back
years 10 years ago this is after there
any satellites visible we have these
objects that will come over and will
signal and then it will then send a
beautiful that this is night vision it&#39;s
actually but blue white light that comes
in and very beautiful and this we have
thousands of hours of these and it&#39;s you
need to be sure you go out with a
satellite chart and preferably the times
of year where you&#39;re up late enough
after any satellites are visible because
we&#39;re in the shadow of the earth and
there&#39;s no mistake now this is beautiful
next and then we have these spheres that
appear that&#39;s me
we&#39;re in a code it was kind of cold and
these there&#39;s clear sky and an object
materializes and signals back you&#39;ll see
huh yeah it&#39;s beautiful
and then they can come in right into the
ground in the forest sometimes you can
have a sphere and inside the sphere if
it came fully into 3d be a mass of ET
craft but often they&#39;ll stay in a form
and also go right in front of the trees
these are right in front of us actually
my wife and I this next one&#39;s so fun
watch boom it looks like a little
lightning but it&#39;s not it&#39;s crystal
clear conditions right in front of us it
comes in so that&#39;s a craft it&#39;s just
bumping up again into the from the gap
into this dimension coming in and then
they&#39;re going to be on the field
around you they may not be visible they
may be there in the near astral gap or
they may fully materialized we&#39;ve had
ones fully materialized flesh-and-blood
who have appeared and then vanished next
this is one of my absolute favorite of
all time just because it&#39;s so cool wear
it in the field above us we&#39;re doing
this the protocols you can hear what I
guess excited is so cute like children
but look it lifts straight up right here
goes up turns left partially D
materializes the camera guy brilliant
and to track this I helped him with my
laser and it comes over and there it is
this and it&#39;s doing this sort of
movement and going in and out of
space-time and vanishes now with the
naked eye seeing this it lifts right up
now watch this in slow motion up right
up from the field in front of us
up into the sky and turns there it is
this as a light ship so civilizations
that have evolved where they can shift
between 3d light astral light pure
consciousness none of the whole thing
that&#39;s what was up at Mount Shasta very
advanced civilizations very high levels
of consciousness attainment next are
these fun yeah
so this is interesting because this
happened several nights just the night
last night we were there so we can mute
that the sound but this is important
because we just came down off the
mountain and the several nights we were
up there we had these objects coming out
and they were showing us the deep inside
Shasta there&#39;s a transdimensional
interstellar facility smooth walls just
wood diffusely lit and there are various
different civilizations connected to
this volcano a Mount Shasta which of
course could become active but
there have been seen this is in a sheer
cliff area in Glacier and nobody could
stand there and we had this happen the
first night a week ago Saturday and two
or three other times that we&#39;re out
there that last night Friday when we
were up there we had in this exact same
location one that was there for about
half an hour until we had a site
invasion from people who had recognized
me in town and we had to evacuate but
next this I love this is I&#39;m walking on
the beach doing my walking meditation
and a person takes this picture feeling
the craft can&#39;t see it and if she in the
sky is a partially materialized disc
same object we&#39;d seen the night before
that came streaking out of the sky and
went straight into the ocean here it is
with the contrast enhancement and it is
a disc and that ship by the way later
we don&#39;t wanna showing it this series
appeared on the beach
partially materialized but with three
points of light
one was teal blue one was white and one
was golden and there were three beans in
there pure consciousness form in an
energy field that communicated we filmed
that for an hour we have an hour of
these things on the beach and at the end
of it I walked into it into the energy
field and there was this beautiful
shimmering light above me the people saw
me Dee materialized I did expect but I
had this experience and I was I knew I
could have gone with them and I knew I
shouldn&#39;t so I was very emotional about
it because you know I&#39;m kind of stuck
here but
Oh anyway so it was I I was crying like
a baby next these are beautiful this is
very typical we have this happen all the
time we&#39;re on the beach you can hear the
water and this is a ship a boat out here
don&#39;t there&#39;s nothing there lights on
the highway 12 on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina barrier islands and you
heard our detector boo boo do we have
electronics that will go off when the
ETS are communicating or approaching us
and they&#39;re just simple they&#39;re you know
magnetometers trifle meters laser
detectors like you&#39;d have for cars for
detecting police and this object comes
look lights up the whole ocean and yeah
and this is remarkable because at the
time it appears there&#39;s beatbeat because
there&#39;s a transdimensional electronic
discharge the color of that was golden
orange this is a night-vision camera so
all you see is greenish but it was a
beautiful beautiful and look when it&#39;s
gone nothing there the no satellite new
playing nothing so they come into this
dimension and appear and what you have
to remember is when something like this
is happening look at the whole oceans
lit up like a full moon it was very very
big very bright is that they&#39;re really
asking you to connect to them in
consciousness into these other
dimensions does that make sense and then
have further contact yeah now watch this
how it moves
this went on for quite sometime in the
middle of all this we&#39;re being harassed
by the federal Park Rangers and they had
did a setup where they gave us permits
for night fishing but not stargazing so
I got arrested and they were gonna put
me in federal prison for three years so
I had to plead to two federal
misdemeanors that&#39;s why I can&#39;t get TSA
PreCheck or anything because I&#39;m a
convicted anyway for praying for
universal peace I mean it was a total
setup you know so that&#39;s why I&#39;m very
cautious where I go now because the Nazi
the federal Nazis have really done a
number next welcome to my world so this
were in France I&#39;m doing a demonstration
it&#39;s about 60 people there for just a
weekend and the Ministry of Defense of
France had a senior Admiral there and
this comes in it&#39;s not quite fully
materialized it&#39;s flat sort of move
coloured every see people turning
everyone saw this flash in luckily a
camera lens was open and it was coming
in because I was getting ready to do a
Sanskrit Vedic ceremony and enter into
meditation it was still daytime but
everyone saw this sort of like
multicolored rainbow come in and the
only thing that the camera picked up was
this very strange etheric barely in this
dimension disc and it was there
observing us a few feet above the ground
waiting for the meditation of the start
so whenever we start the meditation
process and I have a ceremony I do it&#39;s
ancient Sanskrit which predates any you
know known language on earth actually
from the Vedas and the Vedas are not
from that it don&#39;t conflate the Vedic
with Hindu I mean that the Vedas predate
any known organized religion it&#39;s a
philosophy of knowledge and the science
of consciousness and before I was a
medical doctor I was a Vedic scholar and
said Haan meditator and meditation
teacher that
in the 70s so next then this is so
beautiful because we&#39;re on this Beach
about eight years ago and I see this
being come in you see the two eyes here
and it&#39;s sort of a crystalline structure
and these are beings that are at the
level of a level eight nine ten
civilization they have a physical
presence they have world but it is so
abstract is so rarefied but it&#39;s a
beautiful picture now people said what
is this halo it&#39;s sort of a toroidal
like a toroid is like a doughnut energy
field that is created that they can then
appear in but this is this was visible
with Maya well at the level of subtle
perception celestial perception which
develops when you meditate a lot you can
see these energies and I asked someone I
said there&#39;s a beam standing right here
he takes a picture and this is who&#39;s
there very high level at the level of
you know the civilization that&#39;s got
consciousness seven eight nine ten and
above next then this is fun we&#39;re
meditating I&#39;m going through this whole
deep meditation and we&#39;re sitting and
look what comes into the circle this is
one photograph by the way it&#39;s just
showing different part so we&#39;re sitting
there meditating and this is a Peruvian
medical doctor who is having an
Enlightenment experience of her third
eye opening and enlightenment and look
at it come in and wrap around ER and
goes up that is a just one still
photograph beautiful yeah welcome to our
world you should come on these
expeditions so this is yeah I did them a
few times a year and that was just on
you see the ocean back there a beautiful
experience and she told us afterwards
what happened and it was this experience
of contact with a very advanced
interstellar civilization but at the
same time they helped her have this
breakthrough in her opening of her third
eye and her remote viewing capability
and an experience of cosmic
consciousness so they were helping her
she&#39;s a wonderful woman next and these
this is pretty typical things that
happened all over the world we were up
and I would burrow a hill near Alton
barns for so many crop circles had
appeared and we&#39;re encircled this comes
up looks like the Sun that this looks
light it&#39;s actually like 10:00 or 11:00
at night the camera ISO is set so it
looks like daytime and this beautiful
spherical craft appears and you see
people turning around trying to see it
it&#39;s quite beautiful and I don&#39;t know if
it was this year or was a subsequent
year when I was up there doing the
Sanskrit ceremony and meditating that
they allow cows all over this meadow up
on top of Woodbury Hill they all came
around and they knelt down and sat down
around us and meditated with us through
the whole process and when it was over
they got up and wandered off so even
animals and nature will respond to that
state of consciousness yes that&#39;s
beautiful next so this is I mean we&#39;re
looking in a crop circle this is my hand
and I say there&#39;s an object there&#39;s a
spacecraft sphere of this people from
other another star system now with a
naked eye you&#39;re not seeing this but you
can as you zoom in on it you&#39;ll see this
beautiful kind of golden has a bit of a
little bit of blue and red aura around
it craft that a ship that is in a
transdimensional energy field this if it
actually expanded into 3d from
transdimensional
out of the gap fully materialized would
have been a huge spacecraft but it&#39;s
just only in that form and all the
people I&#39;ve dealt with the military and
Air Force folks have seen crafts go into
this form and from this form expand out
into full 3d so there&#39;s this plasticity
of space that we need to remember it&#39;s
not as rigid as you think here it is you
see some blue this is a normal setting
high-quality Nikon camera taken this
picture next
next this is beautiful because I&#39;m doing
this ceremony called a uh and
we&#39;re in a crop circle and this weird
thing appears it&#39;s like a
transdimensional structure and this blue
lighters and we had no blue lights out
with us and this is a and there&#39;s this
with a point and it the whole puja set
is enveloped in this cobalt blue light
and it was after we had done the green
light is the LED of one of our radar
detectors that we put there to pick up
any transdimensional electronics as sort
of an early early warning system or
early notification system but it&#39;s quite
beautiful and we have many of these
objects that come all around us in the
circle through us and and have really
beautiful messages I mean often this
will be happening but we&#39;re having a
message from these other civilizations
next
this is beautiful because this is on
this land I had a crest on Colorado and
there&#39;s an object that lifts up and
stops right here this is one photograph
and it comes straight up from the land
we&#39;re on where we&#39;re doing our contact
goes up amongst the stars and stops and
it&#39;s a transdimensional light ship now
one thing I haven&#39;t shared because it
gets a bit too far into the weeds and I
lose people here the app the very
advanced civilizations their craft and
they&#39;re the people on board are so
seamlessly integrated that the crafts
transmit the level of consciousness of
the occupants
that&#39;s how advanced the technologies are
so you&#39;ll have an experience with a
craft and you&#39;ll experience the level of
consciousness and even the personality
even though it&#39;s a spaceship but we were
talking about AI that would make Silicon
Valley fall apart into the ecstasy but
you know artificial intelligence and
consciousness interfacing technologies
at that level at the interstellar level
at civilizations four five six and above
so that&#39;s beautiful next and this is
interesting we&#39;re out there setting up a
still daytime
and I said there&#39;s a ship over by the
creek and this is coming down from the
Tibetan stupa that&#39;s that the Dalai Lama
asked ambassador George who is on our
team and a friend to building crest
stone and look what comes it just
illuminates and it&#39;s just barely in this
dimension but very golden so the man
takes his camera just takes a normal
picture there it is there&#39;s nothing this
is out in the wilderness the Great Sand
Dunes would be right back here if you
know where that is in Colorado southern
Colorado next
and this I love this we&#39;re on the beach
in Marco Island and we&#39;re here making
contact this is like ten feet in front
of me and this comes in beat and you see
the light and it look how it stars at
this point and in that walnut shaped
object was a whole group of ETS that
then in their sort of astral electronic
bodies if you&#39;re gonna understand
visualize astral projection but with
electronic level they spread out around
that whole area and then we had several
hundred points of blue-white light that
we filmed for two or three hours that
were the essences of these beings that
video tape is stunning
but of course it was night vision so we
didn&#39;t get color so and then this was in
Australia and there&#39;s this someone&#39;s
using a camera that was adjusted for I
think infrared
I don&#39;t do photography none of that I
don&#39;t take credit for any of this except
for making contact but I mean I don&#39;t do
the mechanical stuff you know all I do
with cameras is break them or hand them
the nurse help me with it
you know how doctors are so next you
know it&#39;s this strange object here but
this is so cool so there was a this
comes in and it&#39;s just it&#39;s multiple
lice now this you can&#39;t see any color
but we could see the color of this ship
it was very close
these are all multicolored lights blink
bleeding into each other blue golden red
next and then this is beautiful this was
in last year in Arizona up in the
mountains and this now is really
beautiful there was a beautiful light
that appeared here they&#39;re golden and
you can&#39;t see it with this is a iPhone
hooked to a night vision and we this
last time we were there last month no in
May there were at least 60 or 70 of
these huge golden ships that appeared
they got filmed but I don&#39;t like this
hat doesn&#39;t have that prepared in it but
it was just like that so it&#39;s quite
remarkable next
and then we were at Joshua Tree about a
year and a half ago or so it&#39;ll be two
years in September I believe and we have
a man who&#39;s a medical doctor who does
great photography with infrared has a
still camera and it was way past when
any satellites were visible and there
were two points of light that moved over
us and with his camera he captured this
and take a these are stars of course and
it&#39;s a few second time lapse that&#39;s
because they see the next one and you
see this structure all this so it&#39;s sort
of coming in and out of this dimension
this happened at I think four or five
nights in a row way after any satellites
to be visible very unusual structure
that came over next that oh this is a
same one again beautiful almost like a
platform in space next on this is a
beautiful this happened last year up in
Arizona and in Oracle and this is our
group and let me explain this before we
go on these are stars this is a hillside
obviously this is our group it&#39;s a man
named David Marconi was with us who he
wrote enemy of the state with Will Smith
so he&#39;s on our team and he had a camera
that was pointed in my direction and
that part of our circle after we had
done the meditation because we had heard
footsteps that were not corporeal you
look back couldn&#39;t see anything but then
you&#39;d hear something moving
and some people were touched and at one
point he just so he had his camera had
the lens open it was on a tripod very
high quality camera and we saw this
reddish I mentioned this earlier like a
teardrop shaped red or but it was
elongated flash in between two people
and they it flashed in and
almost everyone looking in that
direction saw it with the naked eye his
camera captured the ET and it&#39;s this
being this is that not a human next
picture and this is an enhancement you
can see this sort of gets pixelated but
there&#39;s a black bubble that he&#39;s in this
is the head it&#39;s kind of triangular the
tunic sort of draped and has a some sort
of electronic device here this is his
hand here and it&#39;s a this is one eye
this the other than those very angular
triangular head there&#39;s a man you can
make out just barely right here this is
a man who right beside him had his
hearing permanently fixed next picture
oh well and this you can see as well
it&#39;s beautiful next as well go back ivme
I want people to see that again
when the interesting thing about this
this is a little pixelated there&#39;s a
better picture somewhere but I want to
point out knows I I head is partially in
this transdimensional field kind of
tunic there&#39;s something he&#39;s holding
here seems like an electronic device and
this is the man and there was another
person here but all we saw with the
naked eye was this ruby red teardrop
shape object but the lens was open so we
got so this is an EEG this uh from a
species that our master healers and this
man was very sweet pure hearted man and
they decided they would correct his
hearing loss and the next day he was and
I&#39;ve talked to him recently he&#39;s still
totally has no problems with the
permanent hearing loss he had had next
so this happened the other night up on
Mount Shasta and we were up there what&#39;s
interesting I don&#39;t know if it can we
see it with these klieg lights or
whatever they&#39;re called but but there&#39;s
a it comes in and wraps a rant comes out
of it fell behind us this is a tree of
course in the Milky and it comes in this
is one frame there you go
I know all these lights behind the thing
I went fluorescently lit but it comes in
here Andrew does a loop and comes back
and materializes this beautiful
beautiful craft and you can see the path
of it but it actually originated from
right behind where I was sitting in the
field up on Mount Shasta now of course
we&#39;ve had thousands of these experiences
and it&#39;s this beautiful golden light
ship that that appeared and that was
just the other night at home at Shasta
next so I think that&#39;s it right so this
I this is just not everything we have
thousands of these is to give you an
example and the lights can come back up
we can leave this up if you&#39;d like a
example the sorts of experiences we have
it&#39;s beautiful celestial level
interfacing with this dimension from an
extraterrestrial source so beautiful so
I hope you enjoyed those those fun
