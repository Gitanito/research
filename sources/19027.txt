so it&#39;s a seven o&#39;clock on the Pacific
time zone it&#39;s ten o&#39;clock Eastern so we
want to start promptly I know there are
people still coming in but I wanted to
get going so I want to thank all of you
for coming and supporting this event and
I&#39;d also really like to thank you and
Obie for allowing us to use their
facility which is quite lovely however
difficult to find and I want to thank
the folks who have been here
volunteering Linda and on and Rikki and
all the people who or these are all
these events that we do are put on with
volunteers so it&#39;s it&#39;s a labor of love
for for everyone I&#39;d like to thank thank
them for their help they&#39;ve been helping
me all weekend this this presentation is
a follow-on to what I presented about a
year ago in Washington on the deep
national security state and the UFO and
extraterrestrial issue how many people
saw that and I&#39;m just curious so it&#39;s a
good thing to look at you may want to
see it again in light of what I&#39;m gonna
be sharing tonight and what I want to
share tonight is personally very
difficult and the reason it is is that
this issue and this presentation will be
the most difficult one I&#39;ve done in 26
years will be very controversial it&#39;s as
in a trauma doctor an emergency doctor I
tell people I&#39;m accustomed to giving
folks bad news so this is very very bad
news and I&#39;m not saying that to be at
all melodramatic I&#39;m telling you what
the truth is and the only reason I&#39;m
doing this is that there have been the
information coming in pinging my system
indicating that we&#39;re getting closer to
the hoaxing of events to Stampede the
world into something that would make
9/11 look like a picnic and there are a
number of signs that have been mounting
on this issue over the last six to nine
months
and I&#39;m gravely concerned about it so
for that reason without being able to
say that anything is imminent my
philosophy has always been an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure and
in this case it&#39;s an ounce of prevention
is worth several billion planets worth
of cure in terms of mass because if we
can do what we should tonight and get
the word out about this to the
president-elect to the incoming director
of Central Intelligence two people in
the Kremlin who were watching to people
all over the world there&#39;s a chance we
can avoid what I&#39;m going to be
discussing so it&#39;s a bit like if you
were to tell someone they have some
signs for a massive heart attack
all right and it&#39;s imminent and you can
do some things right now prevent it you
can ignore it and have it and have a
code blue where the heart stops and you
know you have to be resuscitated my goal
here using that medical analogy a little
further is to avoid the attack and in
this case it would not be a medical
emergency it would be a national
security and global emergency
orchestrated by people who have been
planning this since the 1950s so what
I&#39;m going to be discussing is what in
the parlance of the Pentagon the CIA
counterintelligence programs is known as
a false inw or a deceptive inw or
indication and warning and some years
ago I had a meeting his pop culture
called false flag some years ago I had a
meeting with the
head of the Defense Intelligence Agency
and General Patrick Hughes and the focus
of that briefing which is quite
extensive was to give him information so
that he would not be deceived in the
event of a false or deceptive inw
indication and warning dealing with the
UFO and et issue as it turned out the
general had no knowledge of either the
UFO issue the extra-terrestrial issue or
the fact that there was already afoot
planned since the 1950s a program a
longitude and a long-term
multi-generational program to hoax a
threat from outer space when there was
none is not this was something that the
general was very concerned about because
prior to the meeting i&#39;ts in a briefing
through courier to to the general he&#39;s a
three star and he was unaware of any of
these issues and he sort of mirrored
what he said almost word-for-word what
the first director of the CIA that I
briefed in 1993 said and that is I have
made inquiries into this issue but I
have been provided no information and at
that point he goes over to a bookshelf
in the in the meeting room for the
general which is in the e-ring of the
Pentagon picks up a doll little et doll
looks like one of those little things
you&#39;d get at a toy store store and he
held it up and he was with great anger
said this is all I have gotten for my
inquiries on the UFO issue and was first
are people making fun of him and I said
yes that&#39;s typical however there are
people on your senior staff who are
permanently assigned to this Directorate
to being the director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency whereas the director
rotates just like the CIA director wrote
eight
and they know about it but they&#39;re not
telling you because they want to keep
you in the dark at that instant a
full-bird colonel who was at the
briefing stiffen business visibly
and became quite agitated but remain
silent and my military advisor and I
well afterwards compared notes and said
that man is the gatekeeper deceiving the
director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency now that little vignette
multiplied all throughout the
dysfunction of governments around the
world and so you have people who often
you would think who would have knowledge
of these issues and it turns out they do
not and then there are other people who
should have nothing to do with something
this sensitive who are running the
projects outside constitutional
oversight of the president the Congress
and their appointees and of We the
People most importantly this is why
Admiral Roscoe Helen keator the first
CIA director when it was formed in 1947
took the place of the OSS said in a
letter that the secrecy surrounding UFOs
was a threat to the national security
this is why Eisenhower said the secrecy
unwarranted sequencing secrecy is what
he said it could be a threat to our
democracy and our way of life and they
were referring to this dynamic so what
we have to do is the people and I&#39;m a
citizen
I mean contrary to rumors I don&#39;t do
anything except pro-bono free briefings
for people in government when they asked
me because they found out oops this
stuff is true who can I go to and find
out what&#39;s really going on now be called
in to a briefing but the the problem is
in that vacuum of secrecy extreme
illegal unacknowledged special access
projects which is what they&#39;re called
add a compartmented level and I was
talking to a gentleman today about this
at least 21 levels compartments past the
level of the President
21 levels that you have a permanent
infrastructure that has evolved or spun
off from the legitimate government but
that is embedded within the corporate
sector the intelligence community and
the military sector that is run amok
viciously of our liberties and our
freedoms and have therefore been given
no oversight or restraints so that they
could set up a dynamic where they could
hoax a an alien attack on planet Earth
now this is going to be very complicated
and it&#39;s going to be the most complex
presentation I&#39;ve ever done it&#39;s going
to be intellectually dense so we will
take a break at the two hour point to
stretch our legs come back for some
question and answers because it&#39;s gonna
be heavy stuff now I want to be really
clear that when this I am sharing is I
would not do it if I didn&#39;t think it
could be avoided I would just keep my
mouth shut and retire I think we can
avert this I think that we can avoid the
heart attack as it were I&#39;d be using the
analogy I used earlier and that&#39;s why
I&#39;m standing here before you
otherwise I would have given up on this
in 1994 when I first learned of all all
of these issues so in 1994 by that date
I had learned that there was a Subrosa
deep national security state operation
that had completely gotten out of
control
so badly that when I brought this up to
the general who is in charge of the
Defense Intelligence Agency General
Patrick Hughes he said yes my father in
the sixties knew of such a thing that it
happened we all thought he was a kook
we didn&#39;t believe him he says it wasn&#39;t
until I got into this command as head of
the defense intelligence agency which is
almost as big as the CIA
maybe bigger that&#39;s the Pentagon shop
for intelligence versus CIA civilian and
he said to me that the that his father
eventually committed suicide over this
issue so very heavy I mean this is ten
minutes into the briefing this
three-star general sharing this intimate
and devastating fact and I said well I
can understand that you know I mean a
lot of people have so I said but we
can&#39;t he said he said to me he says how
have you stayed in this game I said I
put my vision on the far horizon and the
far horizon is that we&#39;re going to make
it through this in fits and starts and
we&#39;re going to have a new civilization
begin on this planet the hallmark of
which is a peaceful planet on earth
living peacefully with these other
planets now to get from where we are now
which is that critic at critical
criticality we could call it medically
to get from criticality now to that
point it&#39;s gonna be a very heavy lift
but he said to me he said well I&#39;m glad
you have that hope because otherwise I
don&#39;t know how you haven&#39;t eaten your
gun that&#39;s what he said I said well it&#39;s
not my style anyway but I said but the
point is is that there&#39;s no point in
despairing because what I have seen and
this is the part of me that&#39;s sort of
the spirit warrior and my lucid dreams
of the future is a future where these
issues have resolved we have a peaceful
civilization here there&#39;s free energy
running the planet
there&#39;s anti-gravity systems so we move
above the surface and then don&#39;t need
surface roads poverty has ended there is
complete economic and social justice in
the world and a sustainable clean planet
that becomes a level one as Michio Kaku
would say planet that can go forward and
go into space peacefully that&#39;s what I
see happening and within my lifetime and
I&#39;m kind of an old guy now so
when I started this project I was 34 and
I&#39;m 61 so I point out to people this has
been you know a twenty six twenty seven
year period of work and it pulled me out
of my eight work as an emergency doctor
because it was I realized that we were
in a global emergency and that&#39;s why I
left medicine get it I mean I went from
one emergency to another so so it&#39;s sort
of a Dharma a path service that to be
involved in an emergency so but the
cosmic false flag that I want to talk
about is the crown jewel of the secrecy
that was hatched in the 50s that led to
Eisenhower losing control of these
programs and no president since that
time has had full operational access
control they&#39;ve had knowledge but not
control over these rogue elements so now
we&#39;re sixty years into a period where
these operations have run amok so must
so much so that has become an
existential threat to life on Earth and
this is something we have to understand
how what the modus operandi is what it
are the means for achieving this goal
and I was asked today by a gentleman I
was meeting with he says when do you
think they might do this I say they
began in 1950 something it&#39;s already
happened it&#39;s already happened the false
flag has already happened now not the
crescendo moment not the final act all
right but acts one two three four five
six seven eight nine whatever have
already transpired what do I mean by
that what I mean is these operations
figured out that the psychological
warfare value of this subject was such
that they could set up events that are
completely hoaxed beginning in the 50s
and 60s that would convince people that
those events were extraterrestrial
origin alien when they were not and so
blur the lines between the actual et
activity and the human stagecraft as
it&#39;s called that most people including
people at the White House wouldn&#39;t know
the difference and I began speaking of
this in the 90s those of you who are
around I see Ricky there and a few
others who around the night I began
speaking about this and I would often
say was it is it real or is it Memorex
you know the old commercial for a
Memorex tapes when they used to be
tapes are not digital and the problem is
who is doing a test an essay to see
whether it&#39;s fool&#39;s gold
or real gold the problem is certainly
not you a folk subculture and certainly
not the media no one in government I
know for the most part has a clue even
mid-level people functionaries within
the majority intelligence committee
magic maj I see that runs these
operations do not know about this okay
majestic it&#39;s magic Maj okay the
majority intelligence committee M AJ I
see that&#39;s on the NRO document that&#39;s
the first document that&#39;s in the brief
that went to Obama via Podesta the
campaign chairman for Hillary or the
former presidential candidate Hillary
and also to mr. Trump
this past summer so we try to stay ahead
of the curve and we saw this coming so
one of the main topics later that&#39;s
conventional politics boring but
important but all right but you have to
deal with it now
these false flag operations and I do
like the term deceptive indication and
warning very military very precise by
the way you mentioned that anyone who&#39;s
in counterintelligence and military
intelligence are gonna know what it
means why cuz this is nothing new
do you think this is the first time this
has happened you ever heard of something
called the Vietnam War how many people
heard being not more my I was talking to
a college graduate how long ago never
heard a Watergate or a President Nixon
so alright so there was something called
the Vietnam War and nobody reads anymore
and and and during that period we were
we were of course first we want we had
you know some advisors in there Kennedy
wanted to pull us out was assassinated
Johnson was reluctant to expand and so
they host an event or exaggerating an
event called the Gulf of Tonkin incident
so get your history books open but you
can google it this is mainstream stuff
not conspiracy theory and the Gulf and
Tonkin basically what we did we hoax
tour and exaggerated the attack on our
ships in the Gulf of Tonkin there near
Vietnam so that it would cause outrage
in the public outrage in Congress and it
stampeded President Johnson in to vastly
expanding our presence in Vietnam which
of course enriched guess who the
military-industrial financial gang
bankster complex so trillions of dollars
there at stake here so and it happened
to cost 58,000 American lives and
probably a several million Southeast
Asian lives on a misadventure that was
completely based on a hoaxed or an
exaggerated event you ever heard of
something called 9/11 who was alive when
that happened any children here not
alive I&#39;ve talked to some people
well when 9/11 happened I don&#39;t want to
go too far into this except to say I
have a gentleman who was the
third-highest ranking man at the naval
research labs who prior to 9/11 in the
vice president&#39;s office the president
vice president Cheney&#39;s saw the plans
for 9/11 prior to it occurring he&#39;s
deceased
as I&#39;m talking about it now I did not
talk about it for years
and he was told you know I used to stay
at my home he said look you know I was
told my wife and my children my
grandchildren would be killed along with
me if I ever mentioned this he took it
to his grave gave me the information god
bless him Richard Foix wreckfish who was
very high ranking scientist aerospace
figure in the naval research labs was
the biggest department defense lab so
when 9/11 happened which was about four
or five months after the 2001 a
disclosure event where we had hundreds
of thousands of people contacting
Congress to hold hearings on this issue
which of course when 9/11 happened that
fell way to the back burner very quickly
and they then said well we&#39;ve got to go
get those guys in Afghanistan then they
did something else another false flag
they concocted false intelligence
yellowcake remember the story the story
yellowcake uranium out of africa they
made up all these stories and they put
poor Colin Powell up before the UN
holding a vial of anthrax and other
biological and chemical weapons saying
that Sodom Hussein in Iraq had these he
did not and he was put up there thinking
that he was being provided accurate
intelligence when he was not and there
are people on the inside who have come
forward saying that they knew that that
intelligence was wrong or very likely
wrong but based on that we win
to Iraq where we are still embroiled
blew up that whole area of the world now
we have Isis and this was all planned
and known with malice aforethought so we
don&#39;t have to reach back thousands of
years of with Trojan horses and
machination zuv machiavel and
Psychopaths who have been militaries
over the in the course of human history
we only need gays back from Vietnam to
today to see the extent to which these
false flag operations hoaxed events
exaggerated threats can Stampede a
populace and the Congress and the
presidency into very dangerous and bad
decisions now the mother lode the the
sort of the crown jewel of that kind of
event is what has been planned
assiduously since the 1950s and that is
a threat from outer space that is alien
that would unite the world around a
military junta a militarism that would
put all of humanity together but against
one or more extraterrestrial racists now
that plan which they came up with in the
1950s has been very carefully rolled out
and as you know from my friend Carol
rosin who was Verner von Braun the man
who invented the you know the the rocket
for Adolf Hitler the v2 rocket and who
then was brought in under Operation
Paperclip by the OSS into our
intelligence community and into our
space program after World War two she
said that on his deathbed he said look
you know first we would would they had
this plan there would be the Cold War
and we could have had peace with the
Soviet Union then there would be nations
of concern and global terrorism this we
put out prior to 9/11 by the way then
they would pull out the big one and that
is the threat from outer space and it&#39;s
all a lie and that&#39;s what he kept saying
it&#39;s
all a lie and now when Carol rosin first
told me that I said yes I know that he
said you know about this all right I
said yes I learned about this in 1993
and 1994 and she said well what are we
gonna do I said well what can we do we
have to expose it we have to expose the
big lie and if we do that perhaps we can
fulfill what the who said when they had
the famous song we won&#39;t be fooled again
but it turns out we were fooled again
they were singing about the Vietnam War
of course everybody know that song we
won&#39;t be fooled again I&#39;m not a good
singer anyway but I went to go see them
actually in Atlanta when I was a 18 year
old and they sung sing that song and it
was very interesting because everyone
thought well we&#39;re gonna learn that
lesson of Vietnam we forgot it and we
had Iraq we forgot it so the little
certain amount of time goes by the
population becomes complacent we have a
very short term memory on such things
and then they move another one forward
the reason this one is the big one
that that has been very well planned and
what I&#39;m going to share tonight is going
to ruin some very big plans if it&#39;s
taken seriously so what I&#39;m telling you
is extraordinarily dangerous I mean this
is if you were to rank this on a scale
of one to ten of sensitive compartmented
intelligence information this is but as
high as it goes 10 now I&#39;ve had it
confirmed and it&#39;s gonna be in our movie
unacknowledged and by the way all of you
who contributed that thank you very much
is going forward well we have to have
finished in about a month and then
released late winter early spring 2017
so one of the people that&#39;s going to be
in this movie is an Air Force Office of
Special Investigations
counterintelligence officer who confirms
the false flag name rank serial number
confirms the military is involvement in
staging the abductions of humans making
it look alien
confirms that he carried bags of cash to
people in the mainstream media to
influence the stories and coverage of
this issue and that&#39;s not the only data
point we have Mike the key thing to
understand here I&#39;m discussing all of
this because I don&#39;t know how much time
we have we you know and and releasing
them pulling feature film takes some
time but this needs to get out now
because we have a new president coming
in that&#39;s why I&#39;m here
and it it&#39;s rolling down the track this
plan is bond track now when they began
to discover and I want to put this into
three categories you have assets that
are material stagecraft
and let&#39;s call these advanced aircraft
of manmade origin alright and I&#39;m going
to show you some tonight and it&#39;ll blow
your mind and it should but are there
you know things like this man-made
anti-gravity going all the way back to
the late 50s and 60s triangular disc
boomerang etc I suspect one of the
world&#39;s experts on that issue is in the
audience today and I want to acknowledge
him by the way Michael shraddh who spent
decades studying this and it&#39;s put
together by far
there was comprehensive dossier and
research that I have ever seen on the
issue and that&#39;s why he&#39;s here in the
audience thank you Michael
now what you need to understand is the
gentleman I refer to and and other
people confirmed of this time period to
me that around 9 October 1954 we
attained gravity control so gravity
control meaning electromagnetic systems
that effect an object so it becomes
seemingly weightless levitates and
corrects for gravity
now that research actually began with t
Townsend Brown and others in the 20s if
you look into this and the colossi frost
experiment in germany and others were
using very high voltage high frequency
systems that certain hertz cycles per
second that would cause a change in the
atomic structure in the magnetic field
in such a way that you could essentially
cancel mass okay so without boring
people with a physics lesson if you make
something close to massless no weight a
weight is different from mass massless
then you can accelerate it at enormous
speeds with very little power and it can
go right hand turns go up and down and
if you can control for the interior at
1g there&#39;s one gravitational field then
you can go a tenth a hundred thousand
miles per hour make a right-hand turn
and your brains don&#39;t come out of your
ears which was what would happen in a
jet aircraft so that work was being done
in open source and then classified
projects since the late 20s the secret
weapon that we had was the atomic bomb
the secret weapon Adolf Hitler was
working on was this okay and the
so-called Nazi bell and the and they
never got it stabilized no say it would
lift up and move around we have video
footage of it it&#39;ll be in the
film actual footage however they never
got it stable enough to do a lot with it
so Verner von braun hermann oberth and
others who&#39;d worked at Pinatubo and
these other facilities for the Germans
in World War two were brought in -
instead of being executed like many
Nazis were they were brought into our
intelligence community and to our
aerospace community and some of them
unfortunately took it over from inside
so in a sense we&#39;re living through the
fourth reich we defeated world war ii
was the third reich nazis but they
learned instead of be clumsily stumbling
around doing it that way they went
subterranean so the globe today is a
fourth reichian fascist order now I say
this with no pleasure and I am not doing
speaking hyperbole and that is the
problem it&#39;s a very huge problem and
there are all kinds of actors and
players that have glommed on to that
agenda of the bizarre collection of
people from different walks of life and
different agendas we&#39;ll get into this
later but the secrecy around this issue
is only been partial they have been
wanting a certain acculturation around
UFOs and ETS
for the purpose of having the public
think that it could be true but they
don&#39;t really know what it is so right
now more than half the public over this
longitudinal long-term psychological
propaganda warfare program launched in
the 50s believe UFOs are real they
believe there&#39;s intelligent life in the
universe but that&#39;s about where the the
granular knowledge ends there&#39;s not a
lot of granular knowledge detailed
knowledge of what all this is and the
truth is is that this area of
anti-gravity let&#39;s
call it for pop culture&#39;s usage EMGs
electromagnetic wave it extravagant role
this became the focus of the aerospace
industry and actually was reported
open-source in aerospace journals in the
late 40s and early 50s and then it went
all black this is a documented fact why
did it go black because they finally
figured out how to master it and they
didn&#39;t need to have more people joining
in so they wanted to close off that
discussion so in October 1954 gravity
control was mastered and we began to
build various prototypes of what the
public would call UFOs and some were
made to simulate the shape appearance
and motion of an extraterrestrial
vehicle because what better way to
confuse people than to have something
that looks almost the same is it gold is
it fool&#39;s gold
is it real is it Memorex get where I&#39;m
going here this is this is how the spy
masters operate and luckily for them and
unfortunately for us with the absence of
the Fourth Estate and independent
science and independent oversight from
the Public Interest the Commonwealth
they&#39;ve been able to get away with
enormous deception since the 50s so I
call those the assets that are material
physical craft now that&#39;s one category
we&#39;ll will return to this there&#39;s
another category and this is more
difficult to understand and that is
electromagnetic assets and these include
electromagnetic systems that could
optically like a very advanced hologram
simulate an event electromagnetic
systems that have been called popularly
electronic warfare systems that are
psychotronic and
radionics that interface with
consciousness and thought and
electromagnetic systems that can affect
large segments of the population when
targeted now these began to be developed
quite in an advanced fashion but by the
40s and 50s and by 1956 it had been
accomplished to the point of
state-of-the-art so about a year after I
was born and then the other asset the
third category is human human
intelligence human assets and these are
folks who some wittingly some
unwittingly have been provided with a
script and experiences that they
honestly believe are real but that have
been programmed and are like very
advanced consciousness holographic
experiences if you will electronic
hallucinations and we&#39;ll get into this
also this gets into some issues that are
gonna make me very unpopular with some
folks I don&#39;t care and we don&#39;t have
time for that I don&#39;t care if you like
me love me hate me
it people gotta know the truth on this
so I really don&#39;t I&#39;m not running for a
mayor of crazytown I&#39;m just one
I&#39;m just want the truth out because we
can&#39;t afford this childishness now so
those three categories in general or
what we&#39;re going to focus on first let&#39;s
talk about the air forms let&#39;s call them
material assets that are being made by
Lockheed Martin skunk works Northrop
Grumman my uncle&#39;s old company Boeing
phantom works etc and I have many many
people who have worked in these
aerospace programs also at EG&amp;G here I
mean we&#39;re in Las Vegas in the Nellis
range so-called area 51
up the road it&#39;s an old facility but
we&#39;ll talk about which facilities are
key but those those military and
corporate contractors have always had
compartmented operations dealing with
this going back to after World War two
now the some of the material that was
being done by the Nazis with the
so-called Nazi bell that was
anti-gravity and but it was not well
controlled and they hadn&#39;t developed it
well by the end of the war we detonated
the first atomic bomb first began to get
more and more perfected and as I
mentioned by 1954 gravity control was
attained at that point we had a race to
see how we could of these how many of
these forms we could develop and the
research between the mid 40s and the mid
50s was augmented assisted or propelled
forward by the reverse engineering and
study in a separate compartment of
so-called extraterrestrial material I&#39;m
referring now to things that some of
you&#39;ve heard about like certainly the
Roswell crash came in Arizona event
there are others that have happened and
these objects which were downed with
electronic warfare systems they didn&#39;t
just fly in and crash in an electrical
storm that&#39;s a myth you don&#39;t go through
interstellar space and come into the
atmosphere of Earth and oops I can&#39;t
navigate and then just suddenly crash
and it happens to be right by the only
atomic bomb squadron in the world in
Roswell New Mexico that was the only
509th bomber squadron was the only place
in the world at the time of that event
and the interstellar civilizations were
worried about what is going on on earth
because when we detonated those bombs it
was picked up by them and they came and
they&#39;re here
and they&#39;re worried and they should
worried so that&#39;s what opened up the
modern era of UFO extraterrestrial
activity and this is why you need to
call this what it is there&#39;s two things
here
there&#39;s the UFO is a sort of a general
phrase it just means an unidentified
flying object well is unidentified only
to people who are not informed they
don&#39;t fly in any normal sense of
aerodynamics flying of a plane but they
are objects so the only true part of the
word UFO is oh and the rest is an
obfuscation so a blurring of the truth
but if you use that pop-culture term of
UFO there are two types man-made ones
here interstellar extra-terrestrial ones
here and you can tell the difference if
you get up close enough if you know what
you&#39;re looking for and we&#39;ll talk about
that the ones that were being developed
by these early aerospace and research
efforts were then benefited by studying
the extra-terrestrial objects that we
began to learn how to use
electromagnetic scalar longitudinal
systems now I&#39;m not going to get into a
big physics discussion here except to
say the light you&#39;re seeing here isn&#39;t a
wave like this right so you have a
wavelength and so you have all kinds of
spectra infrared ultraviolet visible
spectra different a laser it&#39;s coherent
light so a green laser is all the green
and it&#39;s coherently propagating okay
longitudinal or scalar electromagnetic
signal is actually not a wave but a
point in a line and it actually can
propagate at multiples of the speed of
light of the wave form of light so the
wave form of light is what we call the
speed of light but there&#39;s this other
type so that began to be studied also in
the 20s 30s and 40s began to be
weaponized
and systems and by 1947 or so they began
to have when I use this word cautiously
successful deployments of it so that
would hit an interstellar vehicle
interfere with its electronics and have
it crash now I know men personally who
have operated those systems up to and
including recently in the last few years
at facilities the various places around
the globe so when you begin to hear that
beginning from the 40s until not that
long ago there were multiple crash
retrievals of these objects they it
wasn&#39;t because these interstellar
civilizations who you know running
around with IQs of four to six hundred
