LIFE
Life is a Universal Element.
"Life is that Element in Nature which im-
pels everything—whether organic or inor-
ganic; physical, spiritual or psychical
—
to
function according to the law of its being."
This definition of The Great School of the
Masters applies equally to Individual or-
ganisms as a whole, and to the various Indi-
vidual organs and parts thereof.
There are four distinct and definite Uni-
versal "Life Elements," and each of these
Elements is responsible for the functional
activities of Life within its own kingdom.
Ether, Air and Water are recognized as
"Elements" of Nature. And yet, they are not
subject to the process of evolution. They are
the same today, as far as science knows, as
they were a million years ago ; or as they were
when they first came into existence. They

have not "evolved" as Elements, or otherwise
changed, in any manner.
They are Universal within the environment
of our planet; and Ether, at least, is supposed,
by physical science, to be Universal in time
and space. Air and Water are sufficiently
Universal to be a part of all planetary en-

Undoubtedly, Ether, Air and Water all
exert their influence upon the Individual
Lives and Intelligences that exist within them
and develop through them. But they, them-
selves, are fixed and established conditions of
Nature; and, as such, are not in a state of evo-

We know that Individual Life and Indi-

waters of the earth. Bear in mind that Water
is one of the "Elements of Nature." We also
know that these Individual Lives and Intelli-

The parallel with the Life Elements, as

the Life Elements; and we know that these

become Individualized by Nature, proceed to
develop, unfold and evolve; but we do not
know that the Life Elements themselves, as

They remain fixed conditions, so far as science

The Life Elements are not limited to the
physical plane of Life; they exist on all
the planes of Life. There is, however, a dif-
ference in the degree of their refinement and
vibratory activity. The Life Elements upon
the spiritual planes of Life are suited to the
refined requirements of the Individual Life
and Intelligence upon those planes.

The Electro-Magnetic Life Element com-

both the Electro-Magnetic and the Vito-

It is here that the Moral Element enters

Individual human life, we naturally turn our
attention and our endeavors to the establish-

and upon the life of human society itself.
From personal experience every Individual
human being, in course of time, comes to
realize the fact that his Attitude has much
to do in determining his influence upon the
society of which he is an important integral
part. He knows that, by the exercise of his
powers alone, he may become either a con-
structive or a destructive influence upon soci-
ety and among his fellows. He may become
a constructive and healthy unit in the social
structure; or he may become a destructive
and disintegrating unit, a unit of decay and
death, the antithesis of Life.

and upon the life of human society itself.
From personal experience every Individual
human being, in course of time, comes to
realize the fact that his Attitude has much
to do in determining his influence upon the
society of which he is an important integral
part. He knows that, by the exercise of his
powers alone, he may become either a con-
structive or a destructive influence upon soci-
ety and among his fellows. He may become
a constructive and healthy unit in the social
structure; or he may become a destructive
and disintegrating unit, a unit of decay and
death, the antithesis of Life.
If he would become a
deadly infection
within the body of society, spreading the
putridity of his poisonous presence broadcast
among the healthy cells of society, making his
22
LIFE
pathway a trail of death among his fellows,
let him harbor within himself the passion of
anger, the spirit of envy, jealousy or malice,
the desire to hurt or to injure his associates,
the purpose to spread dissensions, hostility
and personal enmity wherever he goes, the
ambition to rule or to ruin. He need not wait
long to realize the destructive and deadly in-
fluence he has thus set in motion among his
fellows and associates. His putrescent pres-
ence will proclaim him a power for evil and
the potencies of death will follow him wher-
ever he may go.
APPLICATION
1. Every Individual should cultivate a
wholesome appreciation of the sacredness of
all Individual human life, as well as a defi-
nite knowledge of the fact that he may make
his own Individual Life an irresistible power
for Life or Death, as he Wills that it shall be.
2. If he would become an aromatic balm
for the healing of human hurts and social ills,
let him hold within himself the life-giving
impulse of friendship and good will toward
all mankind.

ALTRUISM
Altruism is a great, profound, funda-
mental principle of Individual Life. It is
constructive in the highest and best sense. Its
antithesis is destructive. And yet, it is the
exception among highly Intelligent men and
women, to find one who has given the sub-
ject sufficient study to have any clear and
definite understanding of the fundamental
principle involved.
Altruism—as the word is used by the Great
School—means: A Genuine regard for the
best interests of one's fellows, accompanied
by an active and sincere desire to render to
them constructive and beneficent service,
without thought of, or desire for, selfish bene-
fits or personal gain.
As employed by the Great School, Altru-
ism is the direct antithesis of selfishness, ego-
tism and personal advantage.

It is found to be the natural occupation of
the Completed Individual.
When two have attained Individual Com-

growth and development of the Individual
Intelligence, begins the Intelligent and pur-

birthday and birthplace of true Altruism.
Thenceforward Altruism becomes the normal
occupation of the Individual; because the in-

that means "Individual Completion", he de-

that is his normal occupation. He labors to
make his fellows happy, because in this effort
for others he finds his own continued happi-

to him there is no sacrifice nor self-denial in

He desires it above all things. This desire is
so overwhelming that he has no thought of
nor consideration for the welfare or happi-

meaning of Altruism. Hence, we must not
condemn him for his egoistic Attitude. It is
an effort for him to consider the interests or
the happiness of others while he is yet in the
midst of the search for his own personal hap-

It is here that the wisdom of the Great
School is able to point the way whereby he
may accomplish his own Self-Completion
with less personal effort and in less time.
Until an Individual has attained the goal of
his own Self-Completion, it is entirely legiti-

largely to his own personal development and
evolutionary Unfoldment.
But he must not forget that he is, at all
times, a member of society and, as such, has
responsibilities which he must not evade, ig-

which is that of Individual Completion, and

The conscious knowledge of this great truth
should inspire men and women with a pro-
found reverence for the altruistic principle at
the foundation of all social ethics. It should
change the focus of their attention from Self
and from selfish personal interest to a cheerful
recognition of the obligations they owe to

An Individual finds himself in limited

upon him. He desires to meet his obligations
and discharge his responsibilities. This gives
him occupation for all his time and personal
efforts. He needs, or thinks he needs, more

Selfishness—the kind that seeks only self-

is a destructive thing in any life. The Indi-

loses interest in them when he can selfishly
use them no longer, is invoking the Destruc-

Nature, in all its varied and manifold as-

Intelligence, throughout all its objective
manifestations and activities, is working to-
ward the accomplishment of some definite
intent and purpose.
Reading the intent and purpose of that
Intelligence in the language of its accomplish-

and certain.
Its purpose is the Individualizing of Intel-

of each Individualized Intelligence to its

This is the method and process by which
man came to know the meaning of "Right"

himself as a creature of the Moral Law, and

with the principle of Wrong and thereby
hinder his Unfoldment, evolution and growth,

From that time forward he came to realize
that the only real value of his knowledge was
in the fact that he could apply it to his Indi-

COMPENSATION
There can be not the least possible doubt
that one of the most vitally important dis-
coveries ever made by science is that there is
in Nature a definite, specific, established, Uni-
versal and immutable Law of Compensation.
This Great Law was first sensed, and later
discovered, by the School of Physical Science.
And yet, even in its earliest efforts to de-
fine the fundamental Principle of Nature
back of the scientific concept and formulate
into definite expression the "Law of Compen-
sation," they were driven to the use of terms
and expressions which, of themselves, gave to
the Great Law a distinctly Ethical signifi-
cance, far above and beyond the limitations
or the application of exclusively physical
facts and physical processes. They said, for
instance, that "Nature demands full compen-
sation for everything she gives." She "exacts
full payment" under all conditions. She de-

there is physical motion, because every atom

the money, and A. is in real need of its tem-

One answered: "The Great Law does
not demand "payment in kind." It is satis-
fied with a perfect equivalent... Being en-
tirely impersonal in its attitude, if A. de-
livers $1000 worth of potatoes to C. who
needs them, this fully satisfies the Law, and
the account is squared. The fact that B. is
wealthy and does not need payment—either in
kind, or in equivalent — removes him from
consideration. The fact that C. needs the
equivalent in potatoes, entitles him to receive
them from somebody. The fact that A. owes
somebody $1000—or its equivalent—entitles
him to discharge his debt by giving an equiv-
alent to C. who needs it."

Yet another, in support of the position of

whatever we do, we are but the instruments
the Great Source uses to balance the process

Whatever You may think of it, there can be

anyone should be in doubt as to the degree of

which makes him know that there is a fixed
obligation upon him to do the things which
his Conscience and Reason tell him are Right,
and refrain from doing the things they tell
him are Wrong.

which he is able, of his own free Will and

To the Individual who voluntarily lives a
life of scientific Morality, Nature promises a
Definite Reward. She promises him an abso-
lute equivalent — in Constructive Self-Un-
foldment (Individual Growth) — for every
ounce of energy he consumes in his Personal
Effort to live a life of Morality.
In the world of Morality, the formulary of
the great Law works itself out along the fol-
lowing lines: The Individual student of
psychology who is striving for Self-Mastery,
knows that Morality is at the foundation of
all Self-Unfoldment, and that Self-Unfold-
ment is the very basis of Self-Mastery. He
knows, therefore, that his first step toward
Self-Mastery is added Self-Unfoldment and
Individual Growth. He therefore says to
Nature: "Give me greater Self-Unfoldment,
because I must have it if I am ever to achieve
Individual Self-Mastery."
Nature replies: "Very well; but, as you
know, I am not a philanthropist. I am will-
ing, however, to give you all the Self-
Unfoldment and Individual Growth you
want, but only on condition that you pay for
it. It would not be right to either of us for

He must hold himself bound by a most solemn

If asked the question: Do you believe you
exemplify Tolerance toward all your fellows?
-it is safe to assume that a majority of both
men and women would answer in the affirma-

vidual Intelligence is analyzed and laid down
beside the foregoing definition, it would be
found that one or more of the elements of real
Tolerance do not exist.
Suppose you are engaged in a diflicult and
important work which you feel yourself
obligated to finish. To do so, you must have
your time free from interruptions; and you
must also have your rest and sleep, to gener-

him, and you feel that you could take pleas-

The "Social Structure" is founded upon the

women come together in the community re-

the "Social Structure," they do so upon the
mutual agreement that each Individual of
them will assume and discharge certain fixed
obligations and responsibilities to his fellows,
and relinquish certain liberties of action,
certain privileges and prerogatives—in order
that the "Social Structure" may endure and
be of service to all.
Today we have carried the development of

may depend upon it that you will be _Iudged
in like manner.
Webster gives the following, among other,
definitions of the verb "to judge":
1. To hear and determine, as in causes on
trial.
2. To assume the right to pass _ludgment
on another; to criticise, or pass adverse ]udg-
ment upon others.
3. To compare facts or ideas, and perceive
their relations and attributes, and thus dis-

tinguish truth from falsehood; to discern, to
distinguish, to form an opinion.
I am convinced that it was in accordance
with this third definition that the Master
Judged Peter, John, Thomas, and others
whom He selected as His Helpers. Of
course, His "Judgment" of each one of them
was a favorable and commendatory "Judg-
ment." But He "Judged" everyone of them,
just the same. I am therefore convinced that,
when He said: "Judge not, that ye be not
Judged," He had in mind one definite and
specific meaning for the word "Judge." From
all that we are taught to believe as to His
character, and His Intelligence, it seems
to me very evident that He really meant:
"Judge not, critically and unkindly, that
others may not Judge you in the same man-
ner." In other words, He meant "Condemn
not, that ye be not condemned." The "Judg-
ment" He had in mind was a condemnatory
Judgment, and not a Judgment of commenda-
tion, or approval. Neither was it a mere
"forming of an opinion."

He "J U(iged" Peter, John, Thomas, even

due—in some measure—to the fact that it is
the very few, even among the most Intelli-
gent Individuals, who take the time and make
the effort to obtain a clear understanding of
the meaning and significance of the term.
Even when clearly and definitely understood,
seldom is it exemplified. This is because true
Refinement is something far deeper and more
vital than mere outward courtesy, or so-called
etiquette. For this reason it is rare—even

Whenever and wherever the Great School
employs the term "Refinement" scientifically,
to express an evolutionary concept, it gives to
it this exact significance:
"The intrinsic results of the evolutionary
effort of an Individual Intelligence to achieve
Self-Completion."
The evolutionary process of an Individual
Intelligence toward Self-Completion is a re-
fining process. Not only that—it is a refining
process that affects each and every department
of Nature within the Individual.
It refines his physical body.
It refines his spiritual body.
It refines the activities of the Individual
Intelligence.
The initial impulse of all human Refine-
ment is in the Individual Intelligence itself.
This means that it emanates from the Indi-
vidual Intelligence, regardless of the plane of
activity on which it manifests itself. This
fact of science raises the question:
"What is the scientific method, or process,
by which an impulse or an Attitude of an In-
dividual Intelligence can possibly exert a re-

SELF-UNFOLDMENT
fining influence upon the purely physical
body of the Individual Intelligence."
It is known that Refinement of the phys-
ical body, whatever the process may be,
directly affects the cellular constitution of the
organism. Physical Refinement involves the
Refinement of the Individual particles, or
cells, of which the body is composed. This
means the Individual particles, or cells of
the body are made smaller in size and their
vibratory activity correspondingly increased.
The problem is: How can this be accom-
plished through an impulse, or an Attitude
of the Individual Intelligence? How does an
impulse, or Attitude of an Individual Intel-
ligence transmute itself into physical Re-
finement?
Nature has so provided that every living
cell of the human body is an active dynamo
of vital energy (which we call "human mag-
netism," or "vitality," or "vital essence").
So long as the cell is alive, it goes on and
on generating this magnetism, or vital energy.

Individual whose body generates it. This
means that the Individual, by the exercise of
his Will-Power, may direct the magnetism of
his own body into any channel, or into any

The Will is an attribute of the Individual
Intelligence. It is its "Power of Initiative"
—
to set in motion the activities of its bodies—
physical and spiritual — through which it
manifests and expresses itself upon the phys-
ical and spiritual planes of life.
Herein lies the answer to the question as to
how an impulse or an Attitude of the Indi-
vidual Intelligence may produce a refining
effect upon even the physical body.
It is a known fact of Nature that the con-
structive activities of an Individual Intelli-
gence do result in a refining process in all de-
partments of human Nature.
Any activity or impulse which sets in mo-
tion the magnetic energies of the physical
body along constructive lines — such as the
impulse that sets in motion the healing ac-
tivities of the vital magnetism, is therefore
both constructive and refining in its effects
upon the very texture of the physical body.

Individual whose body generates it. This
means that the Individual, by the exercise of
his Will-Power, may direct the magnetism of
his own body into any channel, or into any
part of his physical body.
The Will is an attribute of the Individual
Intelligence. It is its "Power of Initiative"~
to set in motion the activities of its bodies-
physical and spiritual-through which it
manifests and expresses itself upon the phys-
ical and spiritual planes of life.
Herein lies the answer to the question as to
how an impulse or an Attitude of the Indi-
vidual Intelligence may produce a refining
efiect upon even the physical body.

The opposite of this is equally true, and the
fact is familiar to everyone who has normal
powers of observation. Any impulse, or Atti-
tude, that sets in motion the vital activities
along destructive lines is, of necessity, the
antithesis of refining, namely, coarsening in
its effects upon the physical body.
Take the man whose impulse and Attitude
impel him to gratify a desire for intoxicating
liquors; or the man who exercises his Will
power to gratify his lustful desires of sex; or,
the man who exercises his Will to gratify a
gluttonous appetite ; or the man who indulges
himself in the use of opiates and narcotic
drugs. In every such case the coarsening ef-
fects upon the very texture of the physical
body are so apparent as to impress itself upon
the consciousness of every Intelligent Indi-
vidual who will take the time to observe the
objective manifestations.
In the case of drunkenness and gluttony,
the coarsening process makes itself manifest
in the tissues of the body. Tissue degeneracy
is apparent in every outward expression and
manifestation. It does not require argument
to sustain the assertion, in such cases, that the

To the average Individual it is more diffi-

the constructive vital processes exerts an
analogous refining process upon the spiritual
body of an Individual.
Coming now to the status of the Individual
Intelligence itself, the evidences become more
apparent. The Individual who permits him-
self to become a moral degenerate; who in-
dulges his impulses to licentiousness; who ex-
erts his Will to set in motion the destructive
activities along lines of absolute immorality,
proves that the process is one which leaves its
coarsening effects and evidences upon the
physical body, quite as distinctly and unmis-

the habit of intoxicating drink.

So true is this that, in exceptional cases, the
refining process resulting from the impulses
of an exalted moral nature, may be carried to
a degree which makes the physical body
almost transparent to the physical sense of
vision. Such as these manifest a luminous

ests; the infinite variety of beauty of colors in
the roses, dahlias, lilies, peach-blooms, apple
blossoms, cherry blossoms, and a thousand
varieties of garden flowers; the variegated
plumage of birds; and the infinite shades of
color which appeal to the sense of sight from
each and every scene and environment of life.
Then let us consider the beauties of Nature
that appeal to us only through the sense of
hearing. Think, for instance, of the beauty
there is in the gentle rustle of the leaves in
the forests; the beauty that comes to our con-
sciousness from all the varieties of the feath-
ered songsters; the beauty we sense in the
sound of a cooing babe, the lullaby of its
crooning mother, the rollicking notes of
laughter in the voices of children at play;
the beauty of music from trained voices in
song; the more majestic beauty of a grand
symphonic orchestra in its artful rendition of
one of the sublime symphonies of the great
Master Musicians of the past and present.

Think, then, of the beauty and symmetry
of these wonderful physical bodies of ours,
which Nature has equipped with both physi-
cal and spiritual channels of sense, through
which we are able to come into the most inti-
mate association with the creative Intelligence
of the Great Architect of the Universe.
Think on and on, until you have exhausted
every channel of human thought; and you
will still be far short of the infinite beauties
of Nature which bless us and inspire us every-
where and from every direction, to go on with
our evolutionary Unfoldment, until we shall
be able to sense, appreciate and understand
the meaning and the beneficence of beauties
that, as yet, are far beyond our limited powers
to see, hear, feel or otherwise sense.
If an Individual should proclaim that in
this extremely practical and utilitarian age he
finds no legitimate place or excuse for Beauty
in human Society, what would be the results?
He would be condemned by virtually all
the youth of our country, and by at least
ninety-eight per cent of all those who are
married and have become the founders of
homes and the parents of children.

the almost Universal experience of humanity
disproves.
Thus he would immediately lose the confi-

Thanks to the wise Masters of the Great
School, it has proven, over and over, in every
walk of life:
Beauty is one of the most powerful con-

Beauty is the influence through which Na-
ture leads us all to an appreciation of the
sublime values of Truth and Goodness, in hu-
man character and Life.
Beauty, physically, spiritually and psychi-
cally, is that which inspires the Love of one
human being for another; the love of one man
for one woman, and of one woman for one
man.
Love is the basis of all human Happiness.
Happiness is the Goal of all Humanity,
as well as all human endeavor.

Love and Happiness (which we all admit are

Human Happiness being the natural result
of Love, must be Good. We know that it is
True, for human experience everywhere as-

Beauty is both True and Good.
Every human home should be made a place

as the combined abilities, tastes and efforts of
its inmates can make it. Beauty is an in-

these is the young man who is the pampered

life, namely, to get all the amusement he can

of Play. He travels from place to place, in-
dulging himself in every luxury his wealth
can buy that will serve temporarily to enter-

Lowell says:
"Humor, in its first analysis, is a percep-
tion of the incongruous."
Thackeray says
"I should call humor ... a mixture of love
and wit."
Webster gives as its synonyms: "playful-
ness, pleasantry, whim, fancy, caprice, com-

All modern lexicologists agree upon the
fact that Humor involves an appreciation of
the incongruous.
But they also agree that incongruous means
a want or lack of harmony, among other

Lowell says:
"Humor, in its first analysis, is a percep-

Thackeray says:
"I should call humor . _ . a mixture of love

Webster gives as its synonyms: "playful-

ness, pleasantry, whim, fancy, Caprice, com-
icality, fun," etc.
All modern lexicologists agree upon the
fact that Hzcmor involves an appreciation of
the incongruous.
But they also agree that incongruous means
a want or lack of harmony, among other
things. This is one of the several meanings

"Humor is the established harmonic rela-
tion of the Individual Intelligence to the con-
structive incongruities of human life, activ-
ities and conditions."
Translating this definition back into the
terms of modern lexicology, it would seem to
mean that Humor is the established harmonic
relation of the Individual Intelligence to the
constructive inharmonies of human life, ac-
tivities and conditions.
Remarkable as it may seem, upon a super-
ficial examination, this is exactly what the
Great School's definition is intended to
convey.
An inharmony is equivalent to a "discord,"
and we are generally taught that a discord is
anything but constructive. An established
harmonic relation to a discord is surely some-
thing out of the ordinary.
Music, of all kinds—both vocal and instru-
mental—depends primarily upon three dis-
tinct elements:
Melody.
Harmony.
Rhythm.

Melody consists of a series of single tones,

one following another, so related as to consti-
tute a tune, or a musical air, or aria. It is
sung by a single voice, or played by a single
instrument. The series of notes is arranged
upon the musical "staff," from left to right,
one note following another, and is read by the
performer horizontally. The tune, or air, of
"Home, Sweet Home" illustrates the meaning
of melody, when sung by one voice, or played
by one instrument.
Harmony consists of two or more musical
sounds simultaneously produced by two or
more voices, or instruments. They are so re-
lated to each other in pitch as to produce a
pleasing effect upon the sense of hearing.
Harmony is written upon the musical staff
perpendicularly, which means one note above
another—and is read by the performer ver-
tically instead of horizontally. The first, third
and fifth of the musical scale, sounded at the
same time, produce a most pleasing effect
upon the ear, called harmony. This produces
a musical chord.

In the forward movement of such a mu-

pass from one sentiment to another—some-

doing the accompaniment of harmony to the
melody must rapidly adjust itself.
It is in this progressive adjustment of har-
mony that a discord often becomes absolutely
necessary to enable you to get from one har-

throwing in a discord between the two har-

merely a "stepping-stone," as it were, by

From a scientific point of view, merriment,
fun, mirth and humor are all the normal
manifestations of the spirit of vigor, health,
youth.
Did it ever occur to you that, whenever you
indulge yourself in a good laugh, it is the
dominating spirit of vitality, health and youth
within you that is thus manifesting itself to
the world? It is the spirit of youth within you
that is doing the laughing, and this no matter

may be.

will be gratefully surprised to realize how

Dignity of a Master, you need only to measure
him by his own yard-stick to determine his
true status.
APPLICATION
1. Develop a "Sense of Humor," if you
do not already possess it.
2. Then do not lose it; but treasure it as the
rarest jewel in the crown of your Character.
Do not let the long face of the religious or
philosophic fanatic, nor the sour Visage of the
chronic pessimist chill your appreciation of
joyous life and normal living. See that each
day contributes its full measure of humorous
gayety and constructive mirthfulness to the
uplifting influence of your own life upon the
depressing drag of the human failures on
every hand.
3. Look for the "constructive incon-
gruities" of life, and you will Hnd them on
every hand. Call your neighbors' attention
180

to them, that you may thus help to develop a
wholesome sense of Humor in them, as well
as in yourself.
4. Laugh and make merry, for this is Na-
ture's great relaxer of a tense body and an
over-active mind.
5. Keep the spirit of youth alive and ac-
tive within you, that you may shed the sun-
shine of health and joyousness wherever
you go.
6. To the cheerfulness that refreshes, and
the faith that makes the body whole, add the
Sense of Humor that preserves a sane and
wholesome mind.
7. Keep the fires of youth within forever
burning; light them with the brilliant torch
of wholesome Humor; stir them to a blaze
with the playful poker of mirthfulness; re-
plenish them with the life-giving energy of
innocent fun; perpetuate them with the sus-
taining spirit of constructive merriment; and
let your Intelligence bask in the brilliant
light and friendly warmth of their radiant
emanations of life's joyous nepenthe.

CHEERFULNESS
If you were asked to define, or name, one
single, distinct Attitude of the Individual In-
telligence which, of itself alone, would go
farthest toward lifting humanity out of the
"Slough of Despond" and giving to it a con-
structive and constant uplifting life impulse—
what would be your answer?
No doubt, in justice to yourself—as well as
to the subject itself—you would not want to
give your answer from mere impulse, but only
after due and earnest consideration. In this
you would be eminently right. But, as the
problem presents itself to your rational under-
standing, can you think of any single charac-
teristic of human nature, or any Attitude of
Individual Intelligence, that would go far-
ther toward the accomplishment of that sub-
lime end, than the State or Condition we

ary defines Cheerfulness as a "Quality, or
State of Being."
2. Its agreed synonyms are given as
"good cheer, gladness, joy, merriment, jollity,
exhilaration," etc.
3. Further, it is stated : "Cheerfulness (as
opposed to gloom) implies a bright and
equable temper, or disposition, which shows
itself in the face, the voice, the actions; it
suggests a strong and spontaneous, but quiet,
flow of good spirits."
"Mirth is like a flash of lightning that
breaks through a gloom of clouds and glitters
for a moment—and then dies. Cheerfulness
keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, and
fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity."
From these suggestions, it should not be
over-difficult to evolve a definition of the
word that will meet the exacting requirements
of Natural Science.
It has reference to an Attitude, or a State or
Condition of an Individual Intelligence.
It discloses itself to others in the expression
of the face, in the tones and inflections of the
voice, in the actions and the entire manner of
the cheerful Individual.

Among other things, it expresses "serenity"
and "tranquillity"—but something more. The
Individual who has attained the Attitude and
state defined as "Cheerfulness," is more than
merely "serene." He is more than merely
"tranquil." He is something more than both
of these together. There is that within him
which expresses a deep and abiding satisfac-
tion—with Life, and with all that it stands
for. No Individual who has enjoyed this
deep and abiding sense of satisfaction can fail
to realize a profound sense of gratitude to the
Great Creative Intelligence. He seems to
acknowledge, within himself, the beneficence,
the graciousness, the eternal right and justice
of all Nature. And, in appreciation of his
own share in the benign gratuities of the
Universe, he sends forth a radiant energy of
pure gladness that fills his entire environment
with a healing Balm.

"Cheerfulness is a State or Condition of an
Individual Intelligence due to its conscious

The kind of Cheerfulness, necessary to the
accomplishment of these constructive results,
is not of the variety that thrives, grows and
matures only in the midst of the most invit-

is it of the character that swings back and

and morbid misery on the other. It does not
shine forth in every lineament of the face to-

morose and unkind in your Attitude toward
your associates, so will you awaken in them
a spirit of resentment that will surely react
upon yourself and bring sorrow and unhap-
piness, in compensation, to you. Keep con-
stantly in your mind the fact-for it is a
fact-that in just so far as you fail to exem-
plify the spirit of true Cheerfulness in your
life and relations with your fellows-and this

household—in just that measure will the
Great Law of Compensation bring back to
you a perfect equivalent punishment, in the
sorrows and regrets that are the natural fruits
of your own planting.
4. Start each day with a thrill of joy, and a
song of good cheer upon your lips. Make this
a habit. Greet your family as if you had just
returned from a long journey. Meet them
each morning with a cheery greeting and a
gladsome smile. This takes but a little time
and effort, and it will bring you manifold
compensations during the day; for you have
started right.
5. When you feel yourself drifting toward
depression and morbidness, force yourself to
sing, or hum, or whistle, some bright and
cheerful song or air. You will be surprised
to note how almost instantly this will banish
all depression and lift your spirits above every
morbid tendency. This is simple, but it is
wonderfully effective as a mental tonic.

SELF-CONTROL
Self-Control is the conscious, intentional
and voluntary exercise of the Power of Will
in restraint of the appetites, passions, emo-
tions, impulses and desires of the Individual
Intelligence. This means voluntary command
over one's Self.
The Great Creative Intelligence endowed
and invested each one of us with appetites,
passions, emotions, impulses and desires
which impel us to action in our Individual
search for satisfaction.
The same thing is equally true with the ani-
mal. Each Individual animal comes into this
physical life, bringing with it a full assort-
ment of appetites, passions, emotions, im-
pulses and desires. It is true that these may
not be quite so complex nor so definitely and
finely differentiated in the animal as they are
in man ;
nevertheless, they constitute the secret

The animal experiences an appetite for
food. This appetite immediately impels it to
action. Instantly it goes in search of the food
that will satisfy its appetite. It meets others
of its kind, and they are doing the same thing.
Each Individual animal is seeking for its
own Individual gratification. It is not think-

lows. There is just one exception to this ab-
solute Attitude of Selfishness among animals,
and that is where the maternal instinct impels
a mother animal to care for her own young
while they are yet helplessly dependent upon
her for life and protection. Except for this
purely maternal impulse, "Self-Preservation"
seems to be the First Law of Nature, in the
animal kingdom. To such a degree is this

the lives of its fellows, wherever this may
seem to be necessary to enable it to satisfy its

He does not hesitate for so much as an in-

In some instances, one animal will join its
fellows in the hunt for, and the capture of,
food. The wolf will join its fellows in the
general hunt for larger, more powerful and

self-gratification or defense. If he tempor-

more powerful impulse of "Fear," and not in
the least because of any altruistic suggestion
or impulse. In other words, at no time does
he exercise his power of Will in restraint of

Power of Will in an unselfish line.
Their exercise of the Power of Will is al-

weaned. The mother instantly casts them out
of her life forever. From that moment she
refuses to feed them or care for them in other
ways. Hence, they immediately accept the
fact that, with them—Self-Preservation is the
first Law of Nature. The mother does the
same. She follows her own natural desire for
reproduction, proceeds to raise a new family
of infants, and forget the old.
In every department of animal life, we

Man possesses the same appetites, passions,
emotions, impulses and desires which impel
the animal to action for their selfish gratifica-
tion. He also possesses the Individual Power
of Will by which to seek their gratification.
If these were his sole possessions, one might
logically and naturally conclude that he, too,
would be impelled to action, as is the animal,
solely by the selfish desire to gratify his ap-
petites, passions, emotions, impulses and de-
sires.
Man possesses something more than does
the animal—something that is fundamental
and vital — something that lifts Man to a
plane of Life and Action virtually unknown
to the animal kingdom.
Whilst it seems to be an open question—in
the minds of many who have made a profound
study of the subject —whether the animal
possesses the power to reason from cause to
effect—there can be no possible doubt that
Man does possess that power. And it is here-
in that Man appears to have a great and
important advantage over the animal. Espe-
cially is this true with reference to the higher
aspects of Individual life and its possibilities.

This means that he must no longer yield to

point to be observed in all this is the fact that
he has finally come to know—as one of the

process in Nature, as well as a Constructive;
that it is within his Individual power to align
himself with whichever process he chooses;
that in choosing the Constructive he is align-

to be Right in Nature; that in choosing the
Destructive he is aligning himself, just as
definitely, with that which we all know to be
Wrong in Nature. He has now come to Know

an Individual, has come to his present under-
standing of "Morality" and the necessity for
Self-Control. The vital and most essential
point to be observed in all this is the fact that
he has finally come to knofw-as one of the
Facts of Nature-that Morality is the abso-
lute foundation of all Constructive Individ-
ual Growth; that there is a Destructive
process in Nature, as well as a Constructive;
that it is within his Individual pofwer to align
himself with whichever process he chooses;
that in choosing the Constructive he is align-
ing himself with that which all men Know
to be Right in Nature; that in choosing the
Destructive he is aligning himself, just as
definitely, with that which we all know to be
Wrong in Nature. He has now come to Knofw
that, overriding the Rights of his fellows, he
is doing that which violates the very Lafw of
His Own Individual Life,'and that, under the
Law of Compensation, he must Pay the
Price which Nature exacts from him for
208
SELF-CONTROL
each and every such violation. He knows
that, as an Individual Intelligence—under-
standing the Principle of Morality—he is
bound by the Law of Personal Responsibility
and Moral Accountability.
Of all the Individual steps he has taken
along the pathway of his evolutionary Unfold-
ment and development, there is not one that
has brought to him a larger measure of real
good than has his recognition of the fact that,
in exercising his Individual Power of Will to
control his appetites, passions, emotions, im-
pulses and desires—so that he shall do no
wrong to his fellowmen—he is thereby exer-
cising his Power of Self-Control in a manner
to develop, within himself, a state or condi-
tion, which, if consistently maintained by
him, will lead him inevitably to the Goal of
Individual Happiness.
For herein he learns the profound Fact of
Nature, that the Individual who attains to that
degree of Unselfishness which impels him to
consider the welfare and best good of his fel-
lows, with no thought of, or consideration
for, his own material gain or advantage,
thereby renders to himself the largest measure

As an Individual Intelligence, your im-

You are assailed by a thousand conflicting

these various impelling emotions and desires.
You know that some of them are destructive;

Poise expresses itself only in the face of

attained it is appreciative of all Nature.
He is able to appreciate every aspect of it,

understands the spirit of mirth. He is gay
and merry with the spirit of youth. He is
wisely sympathetic with those who suffer. He
is serious with those who are thoughtful and

Indeed, no single concept more fully ex-
presses the state of Poise than that of an In-
telligence in Balance. Perhaps this figure
will enable you to obtain a more perfect un-
derstanding and appreciation of the Poise
that results from Self-Mastery
:
An Individual is standing upon the very
verge of a dangerous precipice. He leans out
over the distant mountain torrent that rushes
down there directly beneath his feet. He
knows that one false step would mean his in-
stant death. But there he stands, poised far
above the waiting death beneath. He knows
that he is safe, because he can look down into
the swirling maelstrom without losing his
Balance. He knows that to yield, for the frac-
tion of a second, to any impulse that would
disturb his balance — both mental and phys-
ical—would send his body over the declivity
into the tumbling waters below. But he
knows that he is Master of every emotion and
impulse that would disturb his Balance. He
knows that he has the Poise that gives to him
the assurance of Life.
So it is in many an experience of this
earthly life. We often stand upon the heights

from which any emotion or impulse might

disturb our balance. But, so long as we are
Master of the appetites, passions, emotions,
impulses and desires, we know that we are
safe. So long as we keep the balance of Poise,
we can travel the highways and the byways
of life in the consciousness of absolute safety.
This is the Poise that sustains the Individual
through all the trials and temptations of
life—here and hereafter.
The Poise of Self-Mastery is as valuable
an asset in the development of the Indi-
vidual upon the physical plane of life as it is
upon the spiritual. Let one have in his mind
a definite plan for the future, or an earnest
desire to accomplish some beneficent act; only
by the exercise of Balance, or Poise, can he
keep clear his mental vision, or allow the
Light of Reason to penetrate the confines of
his own Intelligence, that he may see the con-
structive Pathway of Life.
The maintenance of Poise generates Power

Through Poise we maintain constructive
silence. Poise and silence concentrate our
energies in the direct line of our attention, and
make us stronger in the accomplishment of
our right plans and purposes.
Through our complete Balance and Poise
we may keep our consciousness receptive and

He who knows, from a personal experience,

you have to learn is what constitutes the Poise
which every Individual must attain before he
has any moral right to expect, or even hope,
that he will ever be a real "Master of the
Law."
The greatest and grandest reward to the In-
dividual that has achieved Self-Poise, is the
experience of Poise itself.
Only by the exemplification of a consistent
mental balance, or Poise, throughout all the
activities of the faculties, capacities and
powers, may each of us make of himself a fit-
ting "Temple."
And it is this majestic "Temple
,
'
that sends
forth its brilliant rays of Love and Truth to
every traveler upon Life's Highway. Its
magic vibrations attract all who come within
its radiance.
All this is an inspiration to better things.
It gives courage to the faltering, quiet and
peace to the turbulent, constancy to the rest-
less and strength to the weary.

radius of his influence. To the timid he gives
courage; to the restless he gives peace and
quiet; to the hopeless he gives inspiration; to
the suffering he gives comfort; to the weary
he gives rest; to the irritable he gives
patience; to the weak he gives strength, and
to all who would do evil he gives the toler-

Nor is this an attainment beyond the power
of any Individual who is inspired by the
earnest desire to make his life an ennobling
influence among his fellows.
The quiet restfulness of Poise makes pos-

readily to solve the perplexing problems of
life in the radiant Light of Reason, Judgment
and Right. It makes clear the vision, and
opens the way for greater Self-Unfoldment
and Self- Mastery.

bilities of the day, carry the fixed determina-
tion to make the day one that will bring you

anger, fear, or any lack of outward Poise/'

SELF-UNFOLDMENT
For, if you can so "act the part" for a single
day, that you impress your fellows with your
state of calm, peace and gentle forbearance
under all conditions, you may know that you
have won a truly great victory. This is the
absolute evidence that you can live another
day even more perfectly.
6. Repeat these exercises each day, with
all the earnest desire and purposeful intent to
transmute their gracious Spirit into your in-
most Consciousness. You will be surprised
to observe how naturally your Consciousness
begins to open and expand with the inspira-
tion to make it a living Reality. You will
realize each day that you are receiving a
noble and generous reward for every effort
you put forth thus to achieve Self-Mastery
and Poise.
7. At night, when you have relaxed your-
self for a night of restful and healthful sleep,
carry this one mental concept into your sleep
"In Quietness and in Confidence shall be
my Strength."
