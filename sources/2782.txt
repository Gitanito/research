FOREWORD
To
publish another book on spiritualism, while the
spruce forests are being so quickly depleted to
make the pages of important works, would seem to be
an economic crime. No one who believes in spir
itualism ever changes his opinion by reading argu
ments against it. Few who do not believe are won
over by anything they read. What possible justifi
cation can there be for a book of this sort? None,
so far as the author can see. It is perpetrated at
the instigation of a number of insistent friends. It
was their belief that the point of view of a scientist
who had tried seriously to learn something about
modern spiritualism would prove of value to many
people who are interested but are neither believers
nor unbelievers. I hope that they are right.
The Author.
Baltimore, Md.
September, 1935.

CHAPTER I
WHY THE PSYCHOLOGIST?
then a psychologist is introduced to his fellow
VV citizens anywhere, except beneath the classical
shades of the university, he has a feeling of embar
rassment. The reason for this is quite obvious.
Psychology is the most over-advertised subject in the
world. The opinion seems to have gone abroad that
the psychologist is a sort of superman. No one
knows better than the psychologist how bad a mistake
that is. Every summer when I go on vacation I
instruct the family to keep the secret that I have
earned a precarious livelihood teaching psychology
for a number of years. Often the secret leaks out,
via the mother-in-law. Then such embarrassing in
cidents as these have appeared.
A very charming young lady with very large hazel
eyes jockeyed me into a corner of the hotel porch.
There the following conversation ensued:
"Doctor, will you do me a favor?"
"Of course, yes, anything you ask."
"Well, you know, I sing a great deal and I'm
haunted with an ambition to go into grand opera.
If I do, I shall have to leave my husband and little
Paul. So I want to ask you to hypnotize me and rid
my mind of this torment."

2 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
All the while she kept looking at me with those
great hazel eyes, so I replied, "Madam, if this keeps
up one moment longer, someone will be hypnotized
but it won't be you."
Hardly had I recovered from this encounter when
a man with whom I had been playing billiards and
swimming slapped me on the shoulder and exclaimed,
"Mac, I hear that you are one of those —one of
these —err—err, (sigh) ser—"
"Do you mean a psychologist?"
"Yes, that's it! They tell me you're one of those."
I admitted it.
"Well, old man, will you do me a favor?" said he,
with a very earnest expression in his eyes.
"No" I said, "what is it?"
"A few days ago I lost my stick pin. I thought
a great deal of that pin. I certainly do hate to lose
it. Can you go into a trance or look into a glass
ball and tell me where that darned thing has got to?"
"If I could do anything like that do you suppose
I would be living on a college professor's salary?"
These frank people who ask you impossible ques
tions are not as bad as the quiet hero-worshippers.
They silently and solemnly listen to the most trivial
utterances of the psychologist as though the oracle
were speaking again.
Perhaps just one thing more can increase the psy
chologist's embarrassment and that is to insist that
he explain spiritualism. To a psychologist who has

spent years in laboratories working on definite and
detailed problems, the assumption that his interests
have to do with ghosts and goblins puts his teeth
on edge. As a matter of fact the psychologist along
with the physiologist and biologist belongs in a labo
ratory. He spends his life with instruments of preci
sion. They are his daily companions. He works
with them, they work upon him. Gradually he
acquires the feeling that he must have accuracy and
precision. No greater crime can he commit than that
of incorrect observations and inaccurate comparisons.
Naturally, the sort of thing that usually goes under
the head of psychic research gives him an attack of
indignation.
In view of the fact that what is presented in these
pages percolates through the mind of a psychologist,
it might be worth while to take a brief glance at the
psychology of to-day. Such a hasty impression can
be best made by a brief excursion into a laboratory.
Professor Munsterberg of Harvard used to say that
every psychological laboratory had to have at least
two instruments, a chronoscope and a kymograph,
just as every kitchen must have a stove and a frying
pan. For years the chronoscope has been used in
all sorts of experiments. It is an electric clock which
runs only while a current is running through
it,
and
it
measures time in thousandths of
a
second.

mine how long it takes to see a flash of light and make
a response. This is known as "reaction time" and
we find that it requires about two hundred and
twenty thousandths of a second to make such a re
action. During the War the French and the Italians
used to run their young men through such tests to
determine whether they were sufficiently alert to
become aviators. In the air service there are just
two sorts of men, the quick and the dead. Our
scientists thought that the reaction time was not a
very good cue. Any one can be quick in doing the
wrong thing. We ran our men through a discrimi
nation test in which they had to recognize a certain
signal and make a certain reaction. This usually
took them about five hundred thousandths of a
second and strangely enough they could be quick and
accurate even when they had been subjected to an
inadequate supply of air and were suffering from
oxygen starvation. Now this is the kind of problem
the psychologist enjoys. He can vary his conditions
quite accurately and can time the responses of the
man upon whom he is experimenting very nicely.
Another use of the chronoscope is to detect how
quickly one can speak a word in response to a single
word given by the experimenter. This apparatus
you may see in all psychological laboratories. A
diaphragm is placed before the face of the experi
menter, and another before the person who is being
tested. Wires connect both of the diaphragms with

the chronoscope. The instant the stimulus word is
spoken by the experimenter an electric connection is
made and the chronoscope starts running. When the
response is spoken the connection is broken and the
clock stops. Alert college students will take about
six hundred thousandths of a second in making a
response. Such an accurate measurement of time
will show up the least hesitancy in giving a word
associated with the one the experimenter calls out.
Any deliberation, confusion, or embarrassment re
sults in a time longer than the student's average.
The kymograph is a slowly rotating cylinder upon
which is placed some paper covered with lampblack.
The slightest touch makes a white mark upon the
soot. Resting against this smoked surface are sev
eral very light markers. As they move they write
upon the black surface. Simple devices are made to
show the heart-rate and the breathing-rate by lines
on the smoked drum. As a person reads, listens to
music, or gives his attention to a conversation, you
can notice the difference in the lines being traced on
the drum. One very interesting experiment illus
trates how our throats, palates, and tongues are
constantly making little movements as we think. A
bulb can be placed well back in the mouth with a
light rubber tube running from it to a marker along
side the kymograph. With each slight movement in
the mouth this marker will register on the drum. Let
a student be sitting and quietly reading, utterly un

conscious of any activity of his speech organs the
kymograph proves that he is indulging in a sort of
incipient speech.
As I think of our laboratory some other instruments
seem to present themselves for recommendation. A
tone variator makes an impressive appearance. It
supplies a very pure note. Should you tarry in the
laboratory an obliging psychologist might have you
listen to its dulcet tone and tell you that it was mid
dle C on the piano. Then he might say that if you
would close your eyes, listen carefully and tell him
when the note has changed he would inform you how
good an ear you have for discriminating pitch. If
you noticed a change in pitch when the instrument
was producing two hundred and fifty-eight vibrations
he might congratulate you. If it read two hundred
and seventy before you noted any difference he might
suggest that the only instruments you should at
tempt to play are the bagpipe or the bass drum.
If the little experiment with the musical note
aroused your curiosity you might be interested to
know how good your hearing was for very high tones.
Then your cicerone would probably take you to a
little rack upon which hang numerous steel bars.
Each is of a length to give an exact number of vibra
tions per second. Perhaps at eighteen thousand or
at twenty-one thousand you may not be able to hear
the little ringing tone when a cylinder is struck.
There, then, is your limit for hearing high notes.

So we could saunter through the laboratory finding
one device after another for making neat and accurate
records of human traits and abilities. As far as pos
sible every person who is studied is observed by means
of machinery. You can trust a machine for accuracy.
However, the machine cannot do all of the work.
Many observations are impossible to measure by
machinery.
Just here I cannot refrain from calling your atten
tion to two kinds of psychology. One is based on
laboratory methods; the other is based upon general
observation and is largely the result of the individ
ual's opportunities, interests and beliefs. When a
psychologist makes a statement concerning musical
ability you can have a great deal of confidence in
what he says. When he makes a statement about the
younger generation's abilities to make successful
homes, take it with a liberal allowance of salt.
Good observation is indispensable for good psy
chology. We must stop and study this matter a
little more carefully. Observation is fundamental
to all science. As methods of observation improve,
science expands. With the telescope and microscope
and with improved photography, science has ex
panded her borders enormously. Moreover, habits
of careful observation have made the science of today
much more accurate than ever before.
You see there are three steps in the making of any
science. The first is Observation which supplies the

facts. Then Classification which analyzes and as
sorts the facts. And finally Explanation which
deduces some principle or law governing the facts
because of the way they classify.
An illustration will make this clear. You have
probably noticed that when you glance from one eye
to the other as you observe' your eyes in the mirror
you cannot see them move. When you read, your
eyes move with a series of short jumps. You can
easily notice this in anyone reading from a wide page.
If you will put your finger beneath the line you are
reading and move it slowly to the right across the
page, you will notice that all the letters blur, as your
eyes follow your finger-tip. Certainly the page does
not blur as your eyes make those quick movements
in reading. After these two simple observations, you
are ready to go on with a little experiment. Spin
a friend around on a piano stool a dozen times and
then watch his eyes as he looks across the room. No
tice how they jump quickly in one direction and not
quite so quickly in another. How does the room
look to him? It seems to go swimming by in one
direction. But his eyes move in first in one direction
and then the other, so you would expect the room to
move first one way then quickly in the opposite way.
From these observations we make our own classifi
cation of eye movements and decide that the eyes do
not see anything when they move very quickly. We
might jump to the conclusion that the eye becomes

blind when it makes a very quick movement, for
certainly we do not see. Now it becomes necessary
to make some observations. These must be done
with a great deal of care. We place our friend with
his head in a firm rest and before him we place a
screen which moves as rapidly as he spins. We
notice that he does see the screen when it moves as
quickly as his eyes do. So we must throw away our
former conclusion that he is blind during quick eye
movements. Can we find any other facts to put in
our classification of eye movements? Yes, we can
find people whose eyes do not move together. One
eye may be fixed on an object and the other may wan
der. This should present them with two sets of
objects, but it does not. They see only the object
upon which the one eye is steadily fixed and the
blurred image from the other eye is completely ig
nored. From this we conclude that the mind cannot
use blurred images and completely inhibits them.
This would be a principle or a law in the psychology
of vision, but we never should have found it if we
had not been able to make a large number of obser
vations and some of them under very carefully con
trolled conditions.
Subtly the sort of training a man has builds up
habits of thinking. Such habits direct the workings
of his mind. Though he feels ever so free in working
out his problems, he always keeps within the track of
his tried and proved procedures. Above all else he

is convinced that whatever field he is studying in
nature or human nature he has to deal with real
facts. This is the outcome of years of contact with
nature. Her facts may deceive him but he always
finds that the deception was a mistake that he had
made. Moreover, he acquires the habit of thinking
honestly. Attacks that he makes upon nature's
mysteries are frontal attacks, open and obvious.
Never does he assume that his success will depend
upon his ingenuity in some sort of a surprise attack,
some clever flank movement. Whatever may be the
complexities in any problem that science presents,
no scientist has ever drifted into the habit of thinking
that nature has a concealed ingenuity for tricking
him. True, some biologists have urged that there is
some sort of an intelligent direction in evolution,
but no one ever has endowed it with the mischievous
intent of playing jokes on scientists. Naturally
therefore the scientist has a very hard time when he
encounters the "facts" presented by magicians or
spiritualists. Let me illustrate.
A friend of mine took me into his back parlor, set
me on a divan, and told me that he was going to
show me how mind could control matter. This was
to be done by making four cards arise out of a pack
standing in a tall glass tumbler. A pack of cards
was fanned out before me, faces down, and I selected
four. My friend turned to the table to put the cards

in the tumbler. As he did so he exclaimed, "Oh,
have you seen this?" and handed me a fan made of
peacock feathers which had been lying on the table.
When I picked it up, it seemed to fall into shreds.
Then my friend took it and shook it and again it was
a peacock fan. Laughingly he tossed it on the divan
and said, "Let's go on with our experiment." He
put the pack in the tumbler. Standing back from the
tumbler on the little table, he told me to think of the
first card I had drawn. As I did so that card rose up
out of the pack and fell on the table. So each card
popped up and flopped down on the table as I sat
staring at that tumbler and thinking of them.
All through this performance my eyes and my at
tention were on the obvious things my friend was
doing. They should have noted that the four cards
selected were "forced." That
is,
they were, before
me, slightly longer than any of the others and they
also were marked on their edges. Then

watching the movements of my friend's foot on the
floor, for as each card rose his foot moved back about
three inches.
Before I dared observe a good medium doing his
work, I took a number of lessons in magic, all of
which ran counter to my laboratory training. When
I attempted a seance myself, I could readily see the
necessity of doing the important thing while my
friends were observing the unimportant. Thus I
needed my hat near me in order to use it as a shield
for reading face cards in the dark. How to get at
that? Simple. I am a little late to the seance. All
the chairs are taken except my own. I bustle in a
little embarrassed at keeping them waiting, pull my
chair out, push the table in position, give it a few
turns, push it into another position, measure the
distance from it to my chair with my eye—all of
which seems very significant. Then toss my hat
and coat to one side and again fix the chair and the
table and apologize for being late. I am ready to go.
When I want that hat, I have the group sing the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic," so they will not hear
my chair squeak as I reach for the hat. You can
be sure that no one will notice that the hat is not
lying in the same position, when the lights go on,
as it was when I took my seat and started the seance.

in a general way; the second appearance found him
ready to observe details that were important to the
result but were unnoticed before, and the third time
gave more of the obscure data and enabled him to
test out theories that the second show had suggested.
I had been asking him how the famous Margery
had obtained some of her effects and he pointed out
that a good performer does not use the same method
continously to obtain the same effects. Just when
you feel sure that you have discovered the plan, it
changes and you believe you were on the wrong track
all along. That is art!
Never shall I forget the scorn he used in replying
to my remark that I had seen Margery levitate a
basket with hands, feet and head fastened.
"You saw, you say. Why you didn't see anything.
What do you see now?"
With that, he took a half dollar, slapped it between
the palms of his hands. It completely disappeared.
As he was stripped to the waist, sleeves, pockets,
and coat-hnings were all ruled out. I had no idea
how that coin had been so completely deflated so I
asked for two repetitions. Of course, he refused.
Of course the ideal thing would be to train men in
scientific work, in the study of magic and also in
observing and reporting the so-called psychic phe
nomena. This, indeed, is just exactly what some of
the societies for psychical research have done. How

how honest and conscientious he may be, is under
a sort of restraint. In my observation such societies
are not supported, to any extent, by scientific people.
Rather, the money comes from people who are anx
ious to prove the existence of immortality by means
of spiritualism. Any secretary who can find in the
affirmative with a show of scientific precision is
decidedly persona grata. If, on the other hand, he
cannot find anything that even savours of mystery,
he gradually discovers that he is thought of as in
efficient.
Practically, therefore, we have to turn to men who
are under no compulsion, overt or covert. This
does not mean that we can pick any man of scientific
training, teach him magic and turn him loose in a
stance. He, too, may be under a compulsion. Well
may he fear the reception of his report by his fellow
scientists if he does not find a scientific explanation
for everything he encounters. Nevertheless, there
are a number of men who are known by their col
leagues and who would give an honest report no
matter what it might contain. Indeed I know some
of them who would take a keen delight in finding
something that would mystify their associates. So
many exposures of trickery have been made that no
one gets any pleasure out of adding to the list. If
a few well-established, supernormal phenomena could
be accurately observed, there are many able scientists
who would keenly relish reporting them.

WHY THE PSYCHOLOGIST? 15
Among men of scientific training it does seem that
the psychologist is rather better fitted for psychic re
search than the others. In the first place he has to
be trained in several sciences before he is at home in
his own. Biology is a broad introduction to psy
chology. Its point of view and methods of research
are familiar to the psychologist. Physics and me
chanics are indispensable in laboratory psychology.
Nowadays a training in mathematics is necessary
before attempting the statistical methods which are
used in so much psychological work.
In addition to this nearly every active psychologist
becomes very versatile. If you will turn to a copy of
the Psychological Index you will find psychologists
engaged in every imaginable undertaking. They
train rats, remove parts of their brains and discover
some curious things. They measure the number of
words a child of six carries in his repertory. They
photograph the movements of a rooster's eyes when
he is dizzy. They estimate the intelligence of every
thing from the genius to the congressman. They
select employees for different departments in the
great stores. They devise ingenious methods of
teaching children. Through it all runs the same ad
herence to careful observation, accurate comparison
and cautious conclusions.
Inasmuch as the psychologist is the only scientist
who is directly interested in what is called "conscious
ness," it would seem that he is just the man to tell us

whether there is anything resembling intelligence in
the curious phenomena that goes under the heading
of Psychic Research. He should be able to tell
whether there is any sense in the antics of a tilting
table, the performance of the planchette board or the
flickers of psychic lights. Certainly there is no other
scientist whose subject trains him so well for the
study of whether an independent intelligence controls
the pencil of an automatic writer, or a separate in
telligence speaks through the lips of a medium.

CHAPTER II
SCIENCE AND SEANCES
IN
the fall of 1925 I was enjoying a leave of absence
from Princeton University when an invitation
came to meet a committee from the American Society
for Psychical Research. It seems that a number of
the men in the Society felt that a psychologist with
laboratory training would be the type of man to
carry on the sort of investigations in which they were
interested. With some reluctance I met the commit
tee, expecting to find gentlemen with long hair and
wild eyes. No one of the sort greeted me. Two
very able lawyers, a successful business man and an
astute young physician made it clear to me that they
wanted psychic phenomena treated by a scientist
using as rigid methods as science can use. I re
marked to these gentlemen that the outcome would
probably show that no spiritistic hypothesis was
necessary to explain the things they had been study
ing. They laughingly remarked that they did not
care what my ideas were concerning hypotheses. All
that they wanted was an honest study of the facts.
After I had encountered some of the things they had
observed, they thought it was possible that I might
conclude that some of them were brought about by

forces which science had not yet classified or ex
plained. Such an attitude would appeal to any fair-
minded man. No strings were tied to me in any way.
I was given perfect freedom and more generous pay
than any university dreamed of at that time.
Knowing that accurate observations were indis
pensable, my first concern was to find some way of
observing what goes on in a room that is absolutely
dark. As you know, all spiritualists claim that rays
of light destroy spirit phenomena. Only when there
is a very strong psychic force can a little red light
be permitted. Photography seemed to be the best
solution. Ether waves longer than those which
give us red light and shorter than those which give
us violet cannot be seen with the human eye. Of
course they are totally invisible in a dark room. The
infra-red rays take a little longer than the ultra-violet
to register on a film. So I bought a camera with a
film pack and equipped it with a quartz lens. Then
I obtained a good mercury arc lamp and placed a
filter over it so that I could fill a room quite nicely
with ultra-violet light which could not be seen. After
some experiments, I was able to take a picture of a
medium in the dark quite nicely.
Once I was photographing a medium who claimed
that he occasionally had ectoplasm exude from his
body. He was skeptical about its appearing in an
ultra-violet light, but he was perfectly willing to be
photographed. I focused my camera in the lighted

turned out the light, and made exposures from time to
time. When I developed these, I was surprised to see
a line of what appeared to be arrow heads which came
from the side of the picture and vanished at a point
in his chest. There were two lines that converged
upon his chest. As I had done quite a little photo
graphing and had never seen anything of the sort,
I could not explain it. At one of the largest photog
raphy-supply houses they told me that the arrow
heads were not due to defect in photography; that
is,
I
had made no mistakes in exposing or developing
my films. Inasmuch as
I
had bought the films, kept
them carefully, and developed them myself
I
knew
there was no trickery in the matter. Then
I
found
a
gentleman who had invented some photographical
devices and knew the subject thoroughly. He too
declared that the arrow heads were not due to faulty
photography but were actually images of something
which had been in existence in the room. That was
disconcerting. Another specialist in photography
who had been photographing operations for surgeons
and who knew the tricks of cameras very intimately,
also agreed that
I

His remarks were amusing—"Doctor,

20 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
I
Several members of the Society suggested that I
write an article and publish it in the magazine. They
seemed to feel that this was probably the way in
which a medium stocked himself up with psychic
energy. One naively compared it to a water spout
supplying the clouds with moisture. I was desperate.
My own prints were not artistic so I took my films
to the Eastman place and had some excellent prints
made. When the girl handed them to me over the
counter, I remarked, "Look here. Now you have
never seen anything as strange as this, have you?
See these little pollywogs swimming out of space, and
diving into the gentleman's wishbone?"
"Well, it is a little peculiar," remarked the young
lady. "In all the years I have been here I have only
seen two other cases of this. The last one made a
gentleman very mad. He had these funny little
things flying all over the board-walk at Atlantic
City. We sent it to the laboratory and they made a
study of it. I can get you their reports."
That report was surprising. When a picture is
taken, using a film pack, a little current of electricity
can be generated when the paper is torn from the
pack. It does no harm unless there is a defect in the
film. Even then it may run along the defect and not
affect the picture unless the film has been under
exposed and over-developed. Such a thing may
happen once in several thousand times. Imagine

bination of chances had to occur just when I was tak
ing a medium in a dark room.
I am dwelling on this at some length because much
is made of photography in spiritualists' circles.
Amateurs can get some weird results. A man sit
ting with his back to a brick chimney may appear
in his photograph to have a halo around his head.
This has nothing to do with his saintliness. It is a
puzzle in physics. An amateur spiritualist found the
shadow of a mystic key lying across a picture of a
meadow. This gave him material for profound
thought. Prosaic explanation: a key had been left
lying on the paper of films in a strong light and had
made its impression before the film entered the cam
era.
Spirit photographs of little fairies playing tag under
toadstools and motherly faces looking in through the
window have their explanations not with the tricks
the camera plays on the photographer but just the
other way around.
Though my efforts did not yield anything but a
novel experience, it is certainly true that photography
is going to be the way of making records of what hap
pens in the seance. Since my experiment photog
raphy with the ultra violet ray has made enormous
progress. Emulsions have been perfected so that we
now have films that are astonishingly sensitive. It
would not be at all difficult to fit up a room for a

leave the room entirely dark and place a moving
picture camera so that it would command a view of
the whole room. Under these conditions we could be
reasonably confident that most of the movements of
the medium and his confederates can be recorded.
Possibly small and quick movements would not
register but we should certainly get some account of
the medium moving in his chair, extending his reach
ing rod, waving his trumpet or crawling across the
floor.
If you attempt to try such an experiment prepare
yourself to exercise some patience. You will find
little problems popping up here and there that will
tax your ingenuity. It will not be easy to locate your
camera so that it may picture the movements of a
confederate's foot. Intervening bodies will have a
way of masking just what you want to record. More
over, the ultra violet rays do some very funny things.
They will impinge upon many objects and not reflect
at all. Upon others they will strike and give you a
surprising result. For example they will make the
whites of the eye and the enamel of the teeth quite
visible. I shall never forget my first experiments in
a dark room with a friend. Alice in Wonderland
never saw anything so grotesque. A pair of white
eyes and a broad smile came through the dark toward
me. Something was the matter with the smile.
Where a front tooth should be there was a dark space.

tween real teeth and their artificial mates. I also
found that various and sundry objects would become
visible. But it would not be difficult to rule these
out or to cover them with a dark cloth.
What is said in a seance is really more significant
than what is done. Swinging trumpets and flickering
lights, baby fingers tweaking your ear and strange
hands tugging at your trousers do not intrigue in
telligent people very much. On the other hand a
message purporting to come from someone dead but
well known to a sitter may have very great signifi
cance. Many times I have known intelligent and
educated men to ignore the so-called physical phe
nomena but to weigh the strange message they re
ceived with a good deal of interest.
Many things happen in the giving and receiving
of messages that quite escape the attention. Com
pare the recollection of a half a dozen people of what
actually occurred in a seance. You will be surprised
to discover how different their memories are. This
is in part due to faulty memory, but it is more largely
due to faulty observation. One statement was more
impressive to some one sitter than anything else.
This he remembers and insists upon, though others
have but a dim memory of it. Surely, there is nothing
peculiar to the seance in all this. We find the same
sort of thing whenever a number of people are called
upon to give testimony.

impressions are the tricks one's own mind will play.
Time and again I have listened to a quite intelligent
sitter whose voice gave the medium many cues. As
he became interested in what he was saying he forgot
all about how he was saying it. Rising inflections
would creep in to show the medium that the scent was
hot. Little pauses in making a reply, quick responses
which showed interest, all played into the hand of the
medium and the sitter never realized what he was
doing.
To make an analysis of how a message is delivered
it is necessary to have all of the data. That
is,
there
should be a record of each word spoken by the me
dium and the sitter, and also the inflections of the
voice, the pauses, the interruptions, the quick re
sponses. With this in mind
I
tried to construct an
apparatus which would record everything said in the
seance. It was to be
a
combination of
a
dictaphone
and dictagraph with
a
device for registering time. It
would not work. It was necessary to have one speak
directly into the mouthpiece to get
a
good record.

SCIENCE AND STANCES 25
Few experiments can be made with instruments
only. Somewhere in making observations, classify
ing them and drawing conclusions the human element
must enter. Throughout science the influence of
this human element is known as the "personal equa
tion." Years ago when astronomers were observing
movements of the heavenly bodies they found that
some astronomers made their records read slightly
later in observing their phenomena than did others.
This led to a study of the length of time it took to
see a flash of light and to record a reaction. So it
was one of the first studies in reaction time. It
showed that there were differences between individ
uals. The personal equations of some caused their
records to indicate that certain performances in the
heavenly bodies were not being conducted on time.
In the mathematical or physical sciences there is
less opportunity for the personal equation to creep in
than in such subjects as psychology and economics.
However, I have known a maker of scientific instru
ments who maintained that one of his worst troubles
was the personal equation in so simple a thing as
measuring the length of a steel bar. Many times the
bar must be measured and then an average taken to
get a fine accuracy. Now when a man finds his
average is slightly larger than a number of others
made by other men he begins to get shorter readings
in his own measures. No dishonesty is involved.

His efforts are as serious and careful as before but
they show, some times to his surprise, that he is
getting different results.
Mental tests, among the psychologists, often show
the effect of the personal equation. I recall one
experimenter who prided himself on the accuracy of
his work and his ability to detect subnormal children.
When his results were compared with others it be
came evident that his technique was too severe. On
the other hand a psychologist who was particularly
partial to little girls found so few of them subnormal
that his colleagues became suspicious and claimed he
could not resist his personal equation.
In fact the more play the individual's judgment
has the more liable he is to inject his personality into
his study. For this reason the reports of many social
workers are undependable. For example, a problem
which has worried us for a long time is the inheritance
of mental troubles. If we rely entirely upon the
hospital records for patients whom they have treated
we could not possibly make up a family tree. For
this reason trained social workers try to visit as many
members of the patient's family as possible. They
go out into the highways and byways and trace out
as many family connections as they can. Suppose
the worker is convinced that all mental disorders are
inherited. Then we are apt to find any peculiar aunt
or uncle or any crochety great-grand-parent listed
among those members of the family that gave evi
dence of mental defect. Should the worker, on the

other hand, be convinced that only the most flagrant
cases of insanity have hereditary connections, then
we would probably find the same peculiar and crotch
ety people listed among the normals.
However, we need not despair of getting some
pretty good material from trained observers; material
that we can really depend upon. Moreover, we can
gauge the certainty of our material. It is accom
plished in this way. Each observer makes a careful
record. These records are compared by means of a
mathematical formula and we can tell exactly how
well they agree. During the war we devised a
number of experiments to test the abilities of aviators.
After we had graded the cadets it was a question
whether our tests were any good at all. To prove
their value we had several flying officers rate the
cadets as to their actual ability in managing planes.
Facts we could not get at were well known to these
officers, —whether their men made bad landings, flew
with one wing down, climbed too steeply, misjudged
distances, showed bad judgment; or whether they
remembered their instructions at all times and per
formed accordingly. Fortunately these officers agreed
and we found a good correlation between their rec
ords. If the cadets had to be scored on their per
formances by men who could not decide in their own
minds what constituted a good take-off, good control
of the plane, and a good landing, we should never
have found a correlation in their observations.

vations of a soldier's abilities, I cannot refrain from
calling your attention to the Officer's Rating Scale.
Periodically an officer had to rate other officers whom
he knew for their ability. Such traits as leadership,
general intelligence, personal qualities and value to
the service were given numerical values, similar to a
student's marks in college. When a large number of
these had been collected it was possible to form a
fair idea of a man. Sometimes an individual report
would obviously flatter the man too much or condemn
him badly. I recall one report that an officer made
upon one of his fellows after a bitter argument in
which he had been clearly worsted. In his report he
credited his former opponent with fifty-three per cent
of the intelligence that an officer should have. I
have no doubt that this officer was conscientious and
did not imagine that his personal equation crept into
the record at all.
In addition to using the correlation formula for
testing the accuracy of a number of observers, the
scientist often finds that another mathematical device
helps him to evaluate observations. That is the dis
tribution curve. By it he can estimate what an
average is for a number of observations and what
deviations occur. This gives an idea of the accuracy
of the work. Moreover, in a number of cases he can
work out according to the rules of probability just
how improbable some remarkable phenomena may be.

the personal equation show more clearly than in the
observations made in a seance. Never shall I forget
a civil engineer who had excellent scientific training
report how he saw a trumpet rise from the floor with
nothing touching it. So thoroughly was he con
vinced that spiritual forces could move crass matter
that all his scientific training deserted him in the
presence of this illusion. Every medium is keenly
alive to the personal equations of his sitters. The best
seances I have ever seen were held when a number of
uncritical and sympathetic people were present. I
recall one made up entirely of women, most of them
"believers," and all of them with someone whom they
had loved that had died. Helpful messages from
those whom they identified were plentiful, gentle
spirits tossed flowers to them and spirit hands gave
them friendly touches. The same medium had little
or nothing to give when a group of critical men were
present. Naturally every report of what happens in
a seance is coloured by the personal equation. I can
not remember any occasion where three or four care
ful observers kept accurate notes of what they saw
and heard and then sought a correlation for their
records. Obviously that is just the sort of thing that
is necessary. Nothing distorts our observation so
badly as the play of our emotions. Be a little appre
hensive, a little nervous and see what a disconcerting
story you will tell your friends. I have known a man

a thorough-going fake; yet, when he heard what pur
ported to be a message from his father, he could not
make a good detailed report of what the medium said
or what he had replied.
There are not many situations so difficult for good
observation as the seance. To begin with the dark
ness is disturbing to many people. They are not
accustomed to it for it is much darker than their
unlighted rooms at night. Some of them carry over
a little of the haunting fears of the dark of their child
hood. Added to this their composure is not improved
by having a clammy finger touch their faces. In fact
the whole setting makes against a good observation.
Things happen most unexpectedly when everyone is
singing or talking. Their minds are diverted. Un
certainty and expectancy become contagious. An
exclamation of surprise or fright easily disturbs a per
son who might otherwise have kept his composure.
Often one waits for ten or fifteen minutes and nothing
happens. Then when he has become discouraged and
relaxes his vigilance a psychic light may flash in one
side of the room, or a trumpet touch him on the fore
head, so unexpectedly that he can hardly describe the
occurrence at all. Constrained positions with hands
joined and feet flat on the floor become irksome. In
deed there is nothing in the seance to help the naive.
If he has no training to cope with the situation, what
he sees, hears and describes are just about worthless.

A GREAT MEDIUM
Mediums
specialize. Some insist upon one sitter
at a time, some insist upon a group. The
technique differs for the two types.
Among the greatest of group mediums that I met
was Cartheuser. On this I have been reassured by
some of the oldest members of the American Society
for Psychical Research. "In thirty years I have not
encountered so excellent a medium," said one of the
wealthiest and most widely experienced members who
had had an opportunity of studying mediums here
and abroad. When I first met Cartheuser, I was
impressed by his appearance, —rather under-sized,
quite retiring, with pale blue eyes, and a harelip.
He was also said to have a cleft palate. In speaking,
his labials were blurred and his gutturals as well.
Nothing could be more dreadful than trying to get a
message from him over the telephone. His voice was
about the usual range for male voices and had no
distinctive overtones that would distinguish it from
other male voices. In conversation he was always
diffident and reticent, giving the impression that he
was nervous and apprehensive.
In private conversations I gathered from this re

mechanic. Acting as a medium was something he
had taken up when he discovered he "possessed
psychic power." He had a wife and two of the most
attractive children I have ever seen. Conversing
about things in general he showed very good judg
ment and in discussing mechanics he displayed some
ingenuity. However, his professional appearance
gave no indication of an alert mind. On the contrary
he seemed rather dull and stupid. A number of peo
ple remarked that he had not the mental ability to
think quickly and improvise "messages."
If you will read the literature, you will find that
many reports describe the medium as being dull or
feeble-minded, implying that any remarkable or bril
liant effects in their works could not be due to their
own ingenuity. Naturally, it is a great help to a
medium to have his followers believe that anything
strikingly clever cannot be due to his efforts.
I must confess that I acquired quite a fondness
and admiration for this able little medium. Time
and again I have seen his talent pitted against the
hostile criticism of hard-headed business and pro
fessional men. I must confess that I did derive some
pleasure in hearing some of these hostile critics ac
knowledge their bewilderment after a seance with
Cartheuser. In particular, one very ingenious young

engineer who was splendidly trained in science
dropped into a seance one evening for the purpose
of explaining how the tricks were done and gloating
over a friend who was badly perplexed by the whole
thing. After the performance he took me aside and
said, "Doctor, what is the low-down on this thing? I
don't just get it. Of course I know it's fake but I
don't see how." Nor was he alone. Keen lawyers,
doctors, and business men often expressed themselves
in much the same way.
A typical seance with Cartheuser, as staged for us,
was about as follows. The room used was my own
study and I knew there were no tricks or gadgets con
cealed on the premises. It was made completely
dark so that you could pass your hand immediately
in front of your eyes and see no change in the dark
ness. From the ceiling hung an electric lamp on a
long cable in such a way that it cleared the floor by
a few inches. Around the light a shield kept all the
rays from distributing through the room and several
layers of paper dimmed the light down so that there
was only a faint illumination on the floor. In this
illuminated area sat a bowl with water. Often flow
ers were placed in it by the ladies. On either side he
usually placed a trumpet. One was surrounded with
a band of luminous paint, which could be seen in the
dark for sometime after the seance started. Around
the bowl some ten or twelve chairs would be placed in

a circle. After all precautions had been taken to pre
vent any light seeping through the cracks, the seance
was ready to proceed.
An average performance would start with some
instruction to the sitters concerning their behavior.
They were assured that the medium could not guar
antee any results at all as he could not control the
powers which governed him. Each sitter could con
tribute something to the success of the sitting by con
forming to rules that had proven practical. One of
these was to sit in his chair with both feet flat on the
floor. Another was to unite hands around the circle
when requested by the medium. A third was to join
in singing when requested. A fourth was to avoid
being tense, to relax and be natural.
No solemn nor lugubrious air pervaded a Cartheu-
ser meeting. On the contrary the attitude of the
people and the character of the conversation were
quite cheerful, sometimes running into hilarity. This
is quite to the credit of the medium. When one
walks through a graveyard he acquires an attitude
that does not make for giving or receiving very sen
sible ideas. Moreover, the messages that Cartheuser
brought were not of the kind to bring tears into the
eyes of a stone image. He refrained from the pa
thetic scenes of a mother's last few minutes and those
harrowing details of the little child's last sickness.
Jokes were not uncommon. Not a few of the cheerful
spirits that whispered through his trumpets would

essay a jeu d'esprit. Such an atmosphere appealed
to sensible men and women.
To a newcomer in such a seance the first surprise
came by way of the trumpets. The luminous
trumpet could be seen by means of the band painted
with luminous paint. The dark trumpet was invis
ible throughout the seance. At the beginning the
luminous trumpet would rise leisurely from the floor,
the mouth of it swinging in the direction of Cartheu-
ser's seat. Apparently the "spirit" lifting it pointed
the mouth towards the medium. Then this trumpet
seemed to float around the room. It could be seen
high in the air. Indeed, it seemed to touch the ceil
ing which was about eight feet from the floor. Then
it would swing around, seemingly darting from one
corner of the room to another. Sometimes it would
sweep around the circle with a loud, swishing noise,
barely missing the noses of the sitters. One could not
help wondering why some nose was not injured.
Such wonder increased as the trumpet settled down
and began approaching different members of the
group. With the greatest nicety it would float up
alongside of one's ear and a faint voice could be heard
whispering through it. Quite remarkable were some
of its antics. Time and again the mouth of it would
stop so short a distance from my face that a little
push forward would bring my forehead in contact
with it. Once in a while it would give me a friendly
little bump on the top of my head by way of repartee.

But its greatest accuracy was displayed in gently
touching one sitter's eyeglasses.
As you sit in the dark and think about these per
formances it may occur to you to reach out and touch
your neighbor's ear or nose, by way of testing how
accurately your hand can move in the dark. I tried
this. Most disconcerting were the results. If I
aimed at an ear I was quite apt to touch a chin or the
back of a head. Even a swinging movement of the
palm of the hand aimed at a nose may net you a chin
or a forehead. It is well to have a good natured
neighbor. It is well also, to have a good deal of
self composure, for you are going to discover in such
an experiment that you have no accuracy at all.
Then you ask yourself just what is steering that
trumpet. Surely the medium cannot see in the dark;
no one can. Even in daylight these movements
would call for a good coordination between eye and
hand.
Following the surprise from the trumpets there
usually came no little surprise when voices spoke
through them. Before the seance everyone had an
opportunity to talk to Mr. Cartheuser and no one
could fail to notice how badly he articulated. Those
who had made any study of the voice and expression
noted at once that the harelip gave the characteristic
blurring of the labials. This was very apparent.
Added to that the difficulty he had in pronouncing his
gutturals made his speech so unusual that no one failed

to remark it. However, when the voice of "Dr. An
drews" came through the trumpet no one could detect
any defects in his articulation. He represented a
family doctor of the old school. His voice was as
deliberate and clear as anyone could wish. Quite
amusingly it would conjure up a picture of the old-
fashioned doctor with his inquiries about your ail
ments. Quite a different effect was produced when
"Black Bear," the Indian, dropped in. "Dropped
in" is quite the right expression. This voice came
roaring down from the ceiling. Gruff and uncon
vincing was this ethereal aborigine. His broken Eng
lish was pretty thoroughly fragmented but his labials
and guturals were all right. Happily he did not come
often. One meets altogether too many Indians at
seances.
Far and away the most impressive voice that came
through the trumpets was that of little "Elsie." It
was splendid. Its articulation was clear and distinct
and the range of the voice was that of a little girl of
about twelve or fourteen years. It gave the impres
sion of a girl's voice before it has "changed." When
a boy's voice changes it may drop an octave or more.
This occurs at the beginning of adolescence. Girls'
voices also change but no so markedly. As one lis
tened to Elsie's voice it seemed to retain its high
childish soprano. It did not seem possible that Car-
theuser could stretch his vocal cords to reach such
high tones. Time and again different sitters would

comment upon this unique feature. One singing
teacher told me that the Elsie voice had overtones in
it which were not like those of Cartheuser's voice.
Of course the quaint little German accent that char
acterized it was not particularly convincing but it
also gave a contrast to Cartheuser's language.
Those who heard Elsie speaking through the
trumpet a number of times gradually built up in
their imaginations a quaint little personality. Often
she acted as the go-between for the sitter and some
weak spirit who could not sound through the trumpet.
Frequently she talked on her own behalf, always with
a kindly, friendly manner. Now and then she would
indulge in some bright repartee. Often she would
show an interest and a sympathy for some sitter with
whom she chose to talk. There seemed to be a very
thorough consistency in the part she played. Always
she maintained the same sort of childish, half-playful
traits. I have talked with people some time after the
stances and have found that they shared my impres
sion of having heard a very distinct and attractive
little personality present herself. In fact Elsie dwells
in my mind with a good deal more clearness than a
number of characters in fiction where the author had
the clear intention of giving a good character por
trayal. This, too, must be credited to the art of the
medium. No stupid medium could produce a
personality with the charm and the consistency of
Elsie. Here then is a new form of art. It is neither

literature, painting or sculpture. But it is a por

Occasionally, Elsie would give some startling mes
sages. I recall one that seemed to me quite remark
able. Through the trumpet she held, with a very
intelligent lady sitter, a conversation which ran about
as follows:
Elsie: "An old gentleman is here. He says he wished to
speak to you."
Sitter: "I shall be very glad to talk with him."
Elsie: "The old gentleman says that he is your father."
Sitter: "Splendid. I'd love to talk with him."
Elsie: "He says that you do not believe he is your father and
that you would like some cue to prove it."
Sitter: "That would be fine."
Elsie: "The old gentleman says that the cue is 'shoes and
leather.'"
Sitter: "That's a very excellent cue."
Elsie: "He says, why don't you go ahead and get that lace
dress? Now he cannot stay longer. He is becoming weak —
now he is gone."
After the sitting this lady explained the message.
Her father was an elderly man and had trouble with
his eye-sight sometime before he died. In chopping
wood he missed his aim and hit his foot with the re
sult that he had to have a special, small shoe made for
the injured foot. Being a genial, humorous, old gen
tleman, he contended that it was all for the best —
that he did not need so much leather for his shoes,
an important economy. The lace dress was an in
teresting reference. This lady had been admiring a

lace dress but had felt that lace was unbecoming to
her. In her indecision she told the sales-girl to put
the dress aside. So neat and apt was this short
statement from Elsie that the lady could not help
feeling that there was something more than chance in
its remarkable contents.
On one occasion the trumpet drifted up beside my
ear and the following colloquy ensued :
Voice: "Hello, hello, hello."
Sitter: "Hello, who are you?"
Voice, faintly: "Har-."
Sitter: "Harry?"
Voice: "Harrow-."
Sitter, exclaiming: "Oh, Howard!"
Voice: "Yes, yes, yes."
Sitter: "Well old man this is great to have a word with you!"
Voice: "Sure, 'Howard.' How are the ladies? How are
stocks?"
Sitter: "I guess the ladies are all right but you know stocks."
Voice: "Ha! Ha! Ha! Like old times! So you got a letter
from Fred?"
Sitter: "Yes, at last! Do you know what was in the letter?"
Voice: "Sure! He told you all about his trip."
Sitter: "Where is Fred now?"
Voice: "He's in St. Louis. Well, good-bye, I can't hold on.
I've got to go."

ity. Since the experience occurred I have told that

anything, I repeat this experience. Nevertheless, I
am confident that my own observation of what oc
curred and my memory of it do not accurately rep
resent what occurred. In short I am confident that
I am guilty of the usual faults, namely, remembering
the striking and interesting things and forgetting
items that might explain the success of the message;
for this message was a success. The beginning of the
message carries some suspicion. The voice was very
faint and I guessed several names. Undoubtedly, I
exclaimed "Howard" in a tone that indicated that
name was significant. And indeed it was. One of
my oldest friends whom I had known from boyhood
had died a year or so prior to this seance. A mutual
friend who had gone to school with both of us was
"Fred." Neither of us had seen Fred for fifteen years
and had never heard anything about him. He was
an interesting and eccentric fellow who continually
had unusual adventures. The statement that I had
a letter from Fred was remarkable, for I had received
a letter addressed by Fred to a mutual fried several
months after Howard died. This letter contained a
long account of Fred's experiences in the South Sea
Islands. This impressed me very much at the time
of the seance and stands out in my mind as the most
remarkable thing in the incident. The statement
that Fred was in St. Louis was simply a bold remark
on the part of the medium for I had no way of check
ing up on that at the time. Several years later I

learned that Fred had never been in St. Louis. The
remarks about the ladies and the stocks seemed at
the time peculiarly appropriate. This friend and I
began going to see girls together as boys. We en
couraged each other in our courtship. Later in life
we considered ourselves connoisseurs of the fair sex.
Nevertheless, such a remark could have come from a
number of personal friends. The statement concern
ing stocks was also a propos. Many an argument we
had concerning the merits of bonds and common
stocks. That too, is a remark that many another
friend might have made.
I have always valued the recollection of this ex
perience for I find that it makes me quite sympathetic
toward my fellow-men. When I hear remarkable
accounts of a friend's experience with a medium, I
can understand him better. Even after training my
self in observations of both the medium and myself,
I find that I have fallen into the same pitfall as others.
I was surprised to hear the name of an old friend and
my attention went to the content of the message and
not to the inflections in my own voice or to hesitations
in the spirit replies. If a man who sets himself the
task of making accurate observations can slip up
so badly, we must concede that all seances should be
more accurately reported—if possible, mechanically
reported.

any sort of psychic research and both his tempera
ment and his training led him to regard it as childish
and not even entertaining. Nevertheless he was
somewhat intrigued by the fact that Dr. Crandon, a
Boston physician, claimed that his wife was a me
dium. I had talked the Crandon case over with him
and he showed enough interest to buy a stethoscope
and urge me to put it on Mrs. Crandon's throat when
her control was speaking. So I had him attend a

were so numerous that the doctor was quite puzzled.
The fact that the medium mentioned the doctor in
uniform, named a personal friend who had died dur
ing the war and had gotten the number of his regi
ment partly right was quite impressive. Added to
that was the fact that he promptly spoke the name of
someone very close to the doctor and followed it up
by the name of his mother and sister. These items
stood out so clearly that both the doctor and I rather
forgot the irrelevant and insignificant things as we
talked the seance over that night. Later, the reading
of the stenographic notes gave me rather a shock
when I saw how much material there was not really
pertinent.
Many sittings gave far less interesting material
than this. Indeed, a whole evening could be spent
watching the trumpets and listening to such trifling
things as these, which followed the interesting ma

The liveliest evening we had happened when all
the sitters were ladies. The lamp suspended from
the long cable began to swing. It threw its light
upon the feet of the medium, at one side of the circle
and then, upon the feet of the sitters—at the opposite
side. Gradually, the swings became longer. Then
the lamp swung over to Cartheuser and suddenly
stopped, showing his hands resting upon his knees.

A GREAT MEDIUM 49
There it remained long enough for each sitter to see
that the medium was not holding the lamp with his
hands. Then it swung back and finally rested in its
original position. That was a pretty performance
and one would not be apt to guess how it was accom
plished unless he sat in the medium's seat and tried to
do it himself; then it would become obvious. Just
above the lamp was a long loop in the cable which
could be caught in the teeth, leaving the lamp free
to swing slightly as one moved his head but would
throw the light only in the lap. Good mediums are
alert to seize unusual opportunities in order to make
striking effects.
After observing Cartheuser for a number of sittings,
the Society felt that I should be privileged to try some
experiments with him. My first undertaking seemed
perfectly innocent. It consisted in hanging a heavy
black cloth between the seance and adjoining room,
in order to enable a stenographer to sit with a dim
light outside the curtain. Ostensibly, this was to
obtain an accurate account of the remarkable things
that the medium said. In the s6ance-room we
seemed to be in complete darkness. When the lights
were turned out and before the eyes became dark-
adapted, the darkness was perfect. After the eyes
had become dark-adapted, it was possible to see any
object that moved in front of the curtain. Of course
the medium had to sit near the curtain so what he
said could be heard by the stenographer. By placing

between the curtain and myself, I could see, after
ten minutes of dark-adaptation, the outlines of the
medium. He had acquired a technique for slipping
out of his chair; he did not rise to his full height but
leaned slowly forward and assumed a crouching posi
tion so slowly and gently that you could not hear his
chair squeak, and I had given him a creaking chair.
When he lifted a trumpet, he did it with a movement
of the wrist turning the mouth of the trumpet in the
direction of the chair in which he had been sitting.
As the strip of luminous paint swung in the direction
where the sitters believed the medium to be, it gave
the impression that he was being presented with the
mouth of the trumpet. When Black Bear roared
from above, Cartheuser tilted the trumpet toward the
ceiling and the echo of his voice resounded through
the room and gave a good illusion of a sound coming
from above.
To learn how the Elsie voice was produced I de
vised a simple stethoscope. It consisted of a small
tambour which was attached to his neck by surgeon's
tape and had two long rubber tubes which I could
place in my ears. With this device I could hear his
carotid artery and the sounds in his larynx as he
breathed. The faintest whisper was easily audible
and his speaking voice very loud. Quite a surprise
greeted me when I first used this device. Elsie's
voice clearly came from the middle of the room and

not a sound came through the stethoscope. This
occurred a number of times. Then I noticed that
just before Elsie spoke I could hear neither pulsations
of the artery or the sounds in his throat. That would
indicate that he was pinching the tube to shut out the
Elsie voice. But I could not detect the sound of
his finger on the tube which was exceedingly sensitive
and transmitted the sound of the slightest touch.
The situation was intriguing. Elsie and Cartheuser
conversed. Sometimes it seemed that one continued
speaking after the other had begun. Suddenly
through the stethoscope I could hear Cartheuser
change the register of his voice so that the illusion
occurred even there. Then the Elsie voice in the
instrument could be heard with perfect clearness and
it frequently seemed to carry several syllables over
into the sounds of the Cartheuser voice. Cartheuser
had forgotten to pinch the tube! This ability to
vary the tension on the vocal cords
is,

unique. Certainly, the capacity to bring such ten

began to drag. He naively remarked that spiritu
alists often did this and that it did not mean that they
had no real psychic powers. It was rather done in
the desire to give the sitters an enjoyable sitting dur
ing those times when the mystic "power" would not
function. Try as I would I could get no admissions
out of him concerning his art of delivering messages.
It is undoubtedly an art rather than a science. So
at present it is not possible to list the different tricks
that go into the making of messages.
After listening to this little artist delivering his
messages in some sixteen sittings I acquired some in
sight into his technique. The names he used were
usually William, George, John and James. Rarely
did he ever venture a family name. To learn how
many Williams and Georges there are in comparison
to other Christian names I took a directory for New
York City and ran my finger down the page looking
for Christian names. I had to give it up and take a
directory for the remote suburbs before I could find
any Christian names. When I listed them I found
the Williams far in the lead. Then came the Georges,
the Johns and the Jameses. When I had a seance of
my own I told my medium not to get away from the
Williams, Wills and Bills. He did not have to.
Truly it is a curious thing that the medium does not
attempt more Smiths and Browns.
Another feature of Cartheuser's work was the in
teresting way the faint Elsie voice would get a sitter
to accept a name. This was accomplished by giving

a few vowel sounds which could be mistaken for
several different names. When the sitter's voice
showed some interest Cartheuser used the name sug
gested.
To get a sitter to declare himself the voice would
often say, "I see such and such a figure," giving a
general description of a man or a woman, and would
ask if anyone recognized it. Sometimes instead of
describing the person the statement would be to the
effect that "Mary is here." And then the further
information that she passed over some time ago.
Occasionally when the Mary did not fit the require
ments of one sitter she would appeal to another.
One of his neatest tricks was to throw an insistent
sitter off the scent. Some of the men would become
inquisitive and ask critical questions. When the
answers did not come out as they should there would
be a sudden interruption. A trumpet would fall
loudly to the floor or a new spirit in a different voice
would rudely break in. Sometimes a cue would be
dropped inadvertently by a sitter early in the evening
and the medium would attempt to use it in a message
later on.
It would seem, however, that the medium got his
best results from the inflection of his sitter's voices.
Of course with emotional and voluble ladies he could
get excellent results.
All in all he was the most accomplished medium I
have ever met.

CHAPTER IV
AUTOMATIC WRITING
Does
the career of a medium intrigue you?
Would you like to bring messages to your
friends? Has the rdle of the mystic an appeal for
you? If so hark to the words of Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle : "Nearly every woman is an undeveloped me
dium. Let her try her own powers of automatic
writing."
The apprenticeship is rather simple. Take a large
sheet of paper, a soft pencil and two friends. Place
the paper upon a broad table, rest your arm easily
upon it so that you can write with a full sweep of the
forearm. Let one friend rest his hand lightly upon
your hand that holds the pencil. Friend number two
should be in front of you in such a position that your
eyes do not see the paper. His duty is to keep you
in an interesting conversation so that your mind is
not engaged with the writing. Now try making cir
cles; after that is acquired make the letter A, then the
word "an," then the word "man." With some per
sistence the trick of writing and talking at the same
time may be acquired. No guaranty is given that
you will acquire it. I have spent a number of after
noons with a quite charming young lady whose hand

kept a gentle pressure upon mine, but mine refused
to write. However I am a mere man and Sir Arthur
does not suggest that my sex has an aptitude for this
sort of thing.
The best automatic writer I ever encountered was
a very intelligent lady who was well acquainted with
the theories of psychology and the claims of spiritual
ism. With my hand resting upon hers and a news
paper thrown over the hands so she could not see the
writing she would write short paragraphs very clev
erly. At the same time she carried on an animated
conversation with some friends. Whenever I raised
my hand she stopped writing. At first the writing
was in large characters, perhaps two inches tall; grad
ually she brought the characters down to approxi
mately the size in usual writing. She stopped mak
ing the large swings of her hand and used her fingers
as the writing progressed.
Having a theory that the part of the brain which
controlled the movements of her hand was tempo
rarily "dissociated" from the rest of her brain I at
tempted an experiment. It seemed to me that if the
motor area of the brain controlling the movements of
her hand was temporarily free from its association
with other areas, then the sensory nerves should also
give evidence of the same condition. So I stuck my
finger nail into the back of her hand. There was no
response. I continued to jab my nail into her tender
skin until I nearly drew blood. Then she turned to

me with a quizzical expression and said, "Are you
hurting my hand?" I felt that my theory was cor
roborated and that both motor and sensory nerves
in that area of the brain that controls writing were
not functioning in their usual conjunction with the
other nerves of the cerebrum. They did, however,
seem to cooperate in their work in writing, for her
sensory nerves would inform her when her hand had
reached the edge of the table, so that she could bring
her pencil back to the left side of the paper, and they
certainly informed her every time I lifted my hand
from hers.
There could be no doubt about the genuineness of
her writing. Her conversation would lead her to talk
rapidly and interestingly at the very moment when
the pencil was flying across the paper. Of course,
vaudeville artists can do several things at the same
time. In their case it is the result of practice and
acquiring the knack of shifting the attention very
quickly.
For years spiritualistic circles have found auto
matic writing much to their taste. One of the most
outstanding figures in the history of psychical re
search is that of the Rev. William Stainton Moses.
He was a man of fine character, a graduate of Oxford,
who wrote a very great deal, as he thought, dictated
by a group of spirits. At one time he would be re
ceiving messages from "Imperator," at another from
"Rector," and again from "Mentor." These so

called "controls" appeared to have each his own in
dividuality. Each had a message to give to the world
marked with its own character. All of them tended
in the direction of religious teaching and advice.
Other interesting cases have appeared from time to
time. A lady in the Middle West wrote some charm
ing things which purported to come from a spirit who
had lived when Middle English was spoken. Now it
is not easy for a professor of English who has special
ized in the dialects from Chaucer to Queen Elizabeth
to write freely in the terms with which he is so fa
miliar. However, "Patience Worth" is reputed to
have written very freely, using terms she did not un
derstand.
In 1927 Dr. Walter F. Prince wrote a fascinating
book, The Case of Patience Worth, in which he de
scribes the life of Mrs. Curran and gives specimens of
her writing. No one could read these extracts with
out being impressed by their literary beauty. In
deed, her novels and poems have won general admi
ration. The New York Sun commenting upon Hope
Trueblood said that "It is a story that George Eliot
might not have been ashamed to own up to." The
New York Times reviewed The Sorry Tale and stated
that "the long intimate tale is constructed with the
precision and accuracy of a master hand. It is a
wonderful, a beautiful and noble book." The Boston
Transcript's statement about the same book is "the

its power. The impression is that it is the work of a
literary artist."
Dr. Prince quotes some of the poems which he con
sidered attractive. Surely we can all agree with him
upon the poem to the nightingale:
Peace! 'Tis the nightingale! —
Oh moon, silver shod,
Tracking the skies, be still!
Oh stars, cease your pulsing
But an instant! Oh you
Trembling blossom, lean
Against the breeze and rest!
You shuttling moth, hang!
Your intrusions cease!
For a holy instant attend
The nightingale!
Nor is the wit of Patience Worth less striking than
her verse. Guests would suggest topics at her sit
tings and get such quick and quaint replies as these:
the subject "comedy" was given and the response
made, "the fingers of wit tickling the fat side of wis
dom." The subject "hope" brought "the seine each
man flings to the water of the day, and ah, the motley
catch! And yet, and yet, each morrow men do cast
and cast, and e'er shall cast and cast and cast." This
rather unflattering couplet came in response to "Lon

age." Nor is this a trite remark: "Methinks that of

all the gifts from Thy prolific hand, laughter, next to
love, is dearest."
The lady who wrote these charming things did not
impress those who met her with any exceptional tal
ent. Dr. Prince assures us that he has questioned
those who knew her for many years and they told
him that she never had any particular aptitudes in
school and certainly showed no exceptional talent for
literature. She had only a grammar-school educa
tion, and she had not traveled nor read widely. Her
great ambition was to sing and she sought to cultivate
her voice. She had been very much surprised and
mystified by the discovery of her remarkable ability.
It seems that a friend interested her in the ouija
board. After some experiments the board wrote
"Many moons ago I lived. Again I come —Patience
Worth, my name." That was in the summer of 1913.
From then on Patience Worth dominated the writing
and her output has been most prolific.
Naturally such a strange phenomenon as this has
attracted a great deal of attention. Literary men
and scientists have been fascinated by her work. No
one can deny the beauty of her art but this is lost
sight of in the keen interest concerning the reputed
author. Patience Worth calmly stated that she lived
in the seventeenth century in a little English seaport
town, that she migrated to America and was slain by
the Indians. Try as they would her questioners have

town, relatives or friends which would permit a cor
roboration of her story. One would imagine that any
alert intelligence capable of the clever things that
Patience Worth produced could at least supply some
items of seventeenth century England that could be
detected by modern research. Despite this lack of
corroboration Dr. Prince concludes that no theory
based on what we know about automatic writing and
secondary personalities is adequate to explain the
facts. Until someone can suggest a better explana
tion he proposes to hold the one that the fascinating
Patience Worth herself presents. His conviction in
this direction is strengthened by the sharp contrast
between Mrs. Curran and Patience Worth. Grant
ing that Mrs. Curran is a very intelligent woman he
cannot see in her the abilities of a genius and certainly
no one can deny that the writings show genius. He
mentioned an evening with Mrs. Curran and cited a
list of things she wrote. There were thirty- two brief
poems, each started a few seconds after the subject
was given by some one of the company present.
What she said was taken down at once and not the
least striking thing about the material is that no cor
rections were made and the composition was done in
the presence of a critical company watching her. Dr.
Prince quotes Edgar Lee Masters, who was asked if
he knew of any writer who could improvise a number
of poems in the same manner and Masters replied,
"There is but one answer to that question. It simply
cannot be done."

AUTOMATIC WRITING 61
More remarkable is the narrative by Frederick
Bligh Bond, an archaeologist. He was engaged to
make a study of the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey. A
friend had told him of a curious experience. It
seemed that he had felt an urge to write spontane
ously and in trying it out found that the sentences
had a significance for his family. Mr. Bond tried his
friend's ability in automatic writing in order to test
bis "psycho-metric powers." Then he sought in
formation about the buried ruins. To his delight the
instructions he received concerning the locations of
parts of the ancient building proved correct when he
excavated. Later he received scripts from other
sources. One came from a lady living near Win
chester who wrote him concerning the ancient wooden
church which occupied the site of the present Lady
Chapel before the Great Fire of 1184, and said that
the second Norman Abbot, Herlewin, had built a
stone wall around the wooden walls. Later in exca
vating they found a stone footing wall which fitted
the description. Mr. Bond states that about ten
automatists have written concerning the Glastonbury
work. He believes that Margery, the famous Boston
medium, writes under the control of the ancient
"Johannes," and shows a noticeable similarity to the
writing of his friend John Alleyne, who first wrote un
der the control of Johannes some fifteen years earlier.
His account of the finding of the ruins of a chapel
on the north side of the church is very fascinating.

of the parts of these ancient buildings. One dated
from 1534 and stated that a chapel of Our Lady of
Loretto joined the north side of the church. This
was generally accepted. From the script obtained
by his friend quite a description of the founding of
the ancient chapel was given. The story went that
one Abbot Bere, returning from a pilgrimage in Italy
riding a mule, slipped and fell down a precipitous
place. He called on Our Lady to help him. His
cloak caught on a thom bush and he was saved. He
vowed that on his return home he would build a
chapel to Our Lady of Loretto. The script said that
it was built in the Italian style, the first of the kind in
England. It was forty feet by twenty and was not
actually attached to the nave wall on the north but
was some thirty-one feet away, thus contradicting
the ancient description. Mr. Bond states that he
published this material in 1918 and in the late sum
mer of 1919 he sank a shaft and came upon a mass of
stone work that he had missed some seven years be
fore. He followed the whole circuit of a building and
found its dimensions forty by twenty feet. More
over the south wall of this ancient chapel was thirty-
one feet from the old church. So badly fragmented
were the ruins that it was impossible to say in what
style they had been built, but a pendant of a small
niche canopy was of the renaissance type.

the Abbey is really inspired by the spirits of the past.
These he believes to have distinct personality, so
much so that the handwriting of one of them may be
detected. However one cannot help feeling that an
ancient monk who could describe the architecture of
an abbey and who could point out the coming of the
World War and even indicate the day when the tide
would turn against Germany should have been able
to give us a number of facts about his times which
could be corroborated. Indeed, this is just the crit
icism that one hears so frequently concerning these
spiritualist messages. A friend of mine once re
marked that all that was necessary to convince him
of the truths of spiritualism would be a message from
Captain Kidd stating just where he had buried a
treasure and giving an inventory of the knives, forks,
plates etc.
Both of the accounts just cited are by men who be
lieve in the spiritistic hypothesis. Dr. Prince is the
head of The Boston Society for Psychical Research
and Mr. Bond holds a similar position for The Amer
ican Society in New York.
The two cases I am about to present are quoted
from an article by Dr. A. M. Miihl, of St. Elizabeth's
Hospital in Washington. Does the personal equation
enter into the records of these several observers?

England, a graduate of Wellesley College, where she
had taken courses in psychology. She had done
social service work in Boston and had become inti
mately acquainted with some of the misery that at
taches to poverty and crime. She married a pro
fessor of English in a middle Western town. During
a period when she was somewhat tired and run down
she tried the ouija board and found it working un
usually well. Dr. Richmond suggested that she try
to write automatically. With repeated attempts she
developed a great facility for writing and with this
ability there came an increased tendency to "dis
sociate," which finally became so alarming that the
experiments were terminated. During the experi
ments at least seven distinct personalities emerged,
together with several minor ones. These acquired a
name and a handwriting of their own. Each spoke
of himself in the first person, gave coherent accounts
of himself and advice to others. Several personalities
might come at one sitting and interrupt each other
rudely. When a personality was established it would
come with the remark: "So and so is here, what do
you want?"
Miss X with one exception retained her own per
sonality and was aware of what was going on, though
she did not always know what her hand was writing.

of herself very cleverly. This was interesting because
Miss X could not draw. Then Annie told her story.
She had been led astray by a man who had promised
to protect her and she had died in misery, giving
birth to a child. She represented herself as having
lived the life of a prostitute arid had learned to hate
men violently. Annie's writing would be done with
considerable vigor in a coarse, flowing hand with her
arms stiff and the fingers tightly gripping the pencil.
Occasionally she would bang her arm on the table and
pound her feet on the floor. During Annie's appear
ance Miss X's expression would seem to indicate some
fright. She would grit her teeth, press her lips firmly
together, and raise her eyebrows. This expression
grew more marked toward the latter part of the ex
periment.
Mary Patterson was a personality more like that
of Miss X than any of the others. She appeared
rather seldom and would be rudely thrust aside by
the more aggressive ones She used the best English
and her handwriting was much like that of Miss X.
Mary Minott despised the gentle Mary Patterson,
claiming that she was a prig and puritanical. She
would insist that if Miss X would only listen to her
she would become a famous designer. As a guaranty
of this she drew some designs of a number of beautiful
dresses —something of which Miss X was incapable in
her normal condition. Miss X's father who had died
purported to be another personality and assumed the

handwriting of her father. He did not often appear
and when he did he confined himself to remarks about
the family. Alton was a personality of a curious sort
from the spiritualist's point of view, for he was a very
much alive young man, the fiance of one of Miss X's
friends. She had met him the previous summer. He
wrote in very sentimental terms and tried to dissuade
her from marrying the man to whom she was engaged.
He would urge her to give herself up to mediumship
saying that both the dead and living spirits could
speak through her. Surely it would be unique if
we could have a sitting where a living Alton could
read the automatic writing of his own spirit !
A sixth personality represented himself as the spirit
of war and desolation. He sounded dreadful warn
ings and urged Miss X to go in for Red Cross work.
It should be noted that this occurred just before
America entered the world war.
The last personality to develop and the one who
caused the disruption of the experiment presented
himself as "Man." In the beginning he was not at
all distinct, either in handwriting or in the matter of
his messages. He would wander into irrelevant re
marks and would give ambiguous answers. Even
tually he identified himself as Man and would alter
nate with Alton. However, he acquired a dislike
for Alton and finally drove him out of the experiment.
He and Annie McGinnis did not get along at all to

field together, but Man became more persistent and
dominating. He expressed a strong interest in danc
ing. This progressed to such an extent that Miss X
said she could dance spontaneously if she gave herself
up to the impulse. This she did on one occasion;
getting to her feet she began to sway back and forth.
The swaying became more violent, and she began to
wave her arms and make a curious shuffling move
ment. Her body gave a violent wrench and she
cried out in a sharp voice, her face depicting a struggle
of emotions, ecstacy and terror. For ten minutes she
lay stiff and moaning. When she returned to a nor
mal condition she said that she had tried to control
the movements and suddenly realized that she could
not. She was in fear of losing herself and of another
personality gaining control.
The second case is that of a Miss Z. She first
began doing automatic writing during her freshman
year in college as she knew her mother had written,
and thought that she would try. Her automatic
writing differed from that of Miss X, in that it never
reproduced any recurring personality and also in that
it continued after she married. Her work is in the
nature of short stories. The first of these was written
in one evening, purporting to come from one William
Young, who declared that he had been born in Eng
land over a hundred years ago. His was a sad story.
William was a butler to a wealthy family and he drew
a magnificent picture of himself in his livery. All

through, William illustrated the story with clever
pictures. Miss Z, like Miss X had no ability in draw
ing. As the story unfolded, it appeared that the
resplendent William and his brother were both in
love with the same young lady. The story reaches
its denouement and William's exit in a picnic. Here
the wicked brother courteously passed some food to
William, in which was an onion that had been poi
soned. He strangled and died. The lady was ter
ribly grieved but permitted herself to become first
comforted and then wed by the wicked brother.
They lived happy ever afterward to the great annoy
ance of William.
A more intriguing tale is that of Charles You, sent
by the German government to China to make a
geological survey in the interior. He was accom
panied by an assistant, with whom he had a quarrel
which ended in a fight. During the fight he received
an injury in the foot and could not move for some
time after regaining consciousness. Owing to the
lack of proper medical attention an infection started
which resulted in his death. One illustration ap
peared in this story which according to Dr. Miihl
was most remarkable. Miss Z drew a picture of the
bones of the human leg and foot. In the foot not a
tarsal nor metatarsal was omitted and they were per
fectly placed. This impressed Dr. Miihl as she was
then studying anatomy and knew the great difficulty
of drawing the bones in the foot. Miss Z had never

made such a study though she had seen the bones of
a skeleton in the laboratory. When she was asked to
make a conscious effort to draw what she had done
so perfectly in her automatic writing she was unable
to draw anything that resembled the skeleton of a
foot.
Miss Z neglected her automatic writing for some
time; then when Dr. Miihl visited her they attempted
an experiment. Miss Z sat at the table and made
some incoherent records with her right hand. Her
facility for smooth writing seemed to be lost. Dr.
Miihl took a pencil and put it into her left hand, say
ing, "Let's see what that will do." Almost imme
diately the left hand began writing coherent records.
A pencil was placed also in the right hand. There
seemed to be a momentary quiver in each arm and
both hands began writing at the same time, recording
a different message and each denoting a different
sex. In small characters the left hand wrote under
the name of Anita Glane. With bold flourishing
letters the right hand wrote for Daniel Raun. Soon
a conflict arose and the left hand retired from the con
test writing "I want to be strong but I am weaker."
Then the right hand wrote all over the page in huge
letters the word "good."
As we review these remarkable records we are im
pressed by the fact that Miss X studied her own case
intelligently. She had been trained in psychology
and she tried to "introspect" in order to find out how

the curious personalities were built up. She readily
explained Annie McGinnis as a character that de
veloped from her experiences in the social work. An
nie was in part the expression of ideas of which Miss
X had once been acutely conscious. However she
could not at first explain the Alton personality. Only
after numerous attempts at self analysis did she re
call a conversation with her mother. This seemed
to explain the character of his messages and when she
hit upon this explanation he gradually disappeared.
Dr. Miihl believes that the curious personality, Man,
which slowly developed represented a bi-sexual trend
in the subject and came if not wholly at least to a
great extent from the unconscious.
Miss Z presents a curious puzzle in writing with
both hands at the same time. We are not told any
thing about her introspection concerning the two
names that wrote simultaneously though we note that
the first name written by the left hand is that of Dr.
Mtihl. Ihave also witnessed a case of automatic writ
ing where the left hand wrote simultaneously with the
right but wrote the same material. How the centre
governing the movements of the left hand can write
differently from what the right hand is doing consti
tutes a nice problem.
Miss Z's ability to draw the bones of the foot so
accurately brings out a principle which is rather well
known. There are other cases where a subject has
given evidence that he retained very accurately what

he had perceived and could reproduce it in hypnosis.
This makes clear to us that many of the remarkable
descriptions in the automatic writings of reputed
mediums are but the re-presentation of things they
have retained but cannot recall ordinarily.
Dr. Miihl finds the explanation of the personalities
and the clever stories in what is called the "para-
consciousness." It is neither clear consciousness nor
the unconscious. It would take us too far afield to
explore such theories. We only note that there is a
natural explanation and we do not have to resort to
the supernatural.
I do not think we should close this chapter without
warning the ambitious to be careful in their attempts
at automatic writing. Nature has designed the
whole nervous system to act in cooperation. One of
the most important laws in the activities of con
sciousness is that it acts as a unity. Any practice
that makes for a dissociation runs counter to nature
and may result in some harmful effect.

CHAPTER V
WEIRD EXPERIENCES
IF
this world seems too prosaic and you wish for
one enlivened with elves, hobgoblins and errant
spirits just tell your friends you are interested in
psychic research. Surely your desire will be more
than satisfied. Hardly a friend is absolutely bank
rupt of strange experiences. At some time or other
something has occurred that he feels, though does not
admit, lies beyond the explanation of science.
More interesting than anything I have ever said
in the talks which I have given on psychic research
are the stories that my listeners gave me after the
lectures. In this chapter I shall give you a sampling
of the kind of tales that have been told to me. I shall
give only those which came from the people whose
word I should be willing to accept concerning the
ordinary things in life.
A lady of about thirty-five years, a librarian in a
university lost her husband through a violent death.
Some nights after he had been buried he appeared
standing at the foot of the bed. His appearance
seemed quite natural. Remaining long enough for
her to observe not only his features and their expres
sion but his collar, tie and coat, she kept the vivid

recollection of his appearance. The next morning
her little boy who slept in the adjoining room came
to her and said that he had seen his father standing
by the bedside that night.
From a university professor comes this strange
story. His sister was separated from her mother by
many miles. The mother's brother was also some
distance from his sister the night she died but both
had a keen feeling that the one they loved was ex
periencing some tragedy, though they had no reason
to believe her ill or dying.
Practically the same story was told me by a lady
after one of my lectures recently. In this case it was
a mother and sister who suddenly felt a deep concern
for a brother and later learned of his death at approx
imately the time they had their distressing experi
ences.
After a lecture to a group of doctors who agreed
with me that the bizarre happenings in spirit circles
all find an explanation in natural science, several of
them took me aside and started with the well known
formula; "Doctor I know that you are right and I
agree with your point of view but—" Among the
stories they told me one stays clearly in mind. A
number of American officers after the war were quar
tered in an old-fashioned house in the south of Eng
land. One night an orderly came tumbling down the
steps and ran to his officer in a very obvious state
of terror. His story was to the effect that as he

a woman looked out at him from the wall. He was
not enough of a soldier to stand that sort of a surprise
attack. Moreover he swore that some one else would
have to take over that detail. He would never turn
lights out on the third floor any more. The officer
inquired about his habits, especially the kind and
amount of liquor he had been using. No banter or
assurances could send that private to the third floor
next evening. However, when his officer volunteered
to accompany him, he went. Sure enough when the
light went out the lady came in. Straight out from
the wall she stared into their faces. Officer and man
beat a retreat. Inquiries from some of the old people
in the neighborhood brought out a story that ran
back over a century. King George the Third had
kept a beautiful mistress in this old home. He would
occasionally come down and live with her. Then his
ardor cooled and his visits became infrequent. Then
the lady after months of weary loneliness ended her
unhappy life with her own hand, but she never could
free her spirit. Time and again through the century
her unhappy eyes would look into those of men and
women who walked the halls where she once had
been so happy.
Here is another by a British officer. The scene is
laid in Canada. Several young officers are quartered
in a long stone house equipped with creaking stairs.

would creak step by step from the bottom to the top.
Then the hall floor boards would creak as though
someone were softly stepping his way down to the
last room at the end of the hall. Where my friend
lodged, a beam of light from his room would cut across
the hall between the head of the stairs and that end
room. Whenever his door was open at night and the
lamp burning the creaking steps and floor would reg
ister right up to that beam of light. Again and again
my friend would jump out into the hall with his flash
light and see exactly nothing.
Here is something similar with a better denoue
ment. A lady, two daughters and a son dwelt in
Cambridge in the classic shades of old Harvard.
Picture to yourself one of those quaint old American
houses, built in what might be called the Carpenter's
Age, with rooms of curious shape and stairways that
seemed to be an afterthought of the builder. Such
dry and seasoned wood is most hospitable to vagrant
spirits. In this setting the mother of the lady de
parted this life and returned. On many occasions as
the family sat in the library downstairs they would
hear the planks of the front hall and the stairway
respond to the slow step of an invisible visitor. They
did not stop until they entered the room which had
belonged to the elderly lady. In that room they could
hear closet doors opening and closing and bureau
drawers pulled out and thrust back. At first it was
surprising and alarming, then it became amusing, and

then irritating. They did the correct thing for a
citizen of Cambridge. Calling in a Harvard pro
fessor they told him the story. He ventured an
experiment. A medium came and sat in the house
during the evenings. Finally, she declared that the
elderly lady's spirit had returned and was distressed
to learn that she had made so much noise. She
promised to come no more and claimed that she only
dropped in to see that things were tidied up. After
that she came no more. Only those who know the
New England housekeeper can really share her dis
appointment.
This story really gets nowhere. Since it was told
to me by a psychologist for whom I have a great deal
of respect I shall enter it. Here the scene is a lonely
little house covered and surrounded with snow. In
the humble parlour stands a casket. My friend, then
a young man at college, is trying to comfort and help
the family. As the night wears on the members of
the family become very tired. He urges them to go
to bed and assures them that he will watch by the
casket during the night. After sitting in that lonely
room for some time he is violently startled by a
vigorous rattling at the door. Quickly swinging
it open he peers out into the night —deep blue sky
above and broad white wastes of snow beneath. Not
the mark of a footprint anywhere. Then his scien
tific curiosity is aroused. Out he goes and circles the

beast nor is the snow around the door disturbed.
To this day he declares he has found no explanation.
I can think now of but one man who claimed to
have come face to face with a veritable ghost. He
was a sentinel in the German army during peace
times. As he patrolled his beat his attention was
attracted to a white figure coming down the road
toward him. He was quite prepared to enjoy the
joke of a fellow soldier and a sheet. However as it
approached he did not like its gait. Seemingly it
glided along without the bobbing motion of a person
walking. As it approached him he noted that it was
transparent. On its way past him, he reached out
and touched it. Naively he remarked that it could
not have come from hell as it was very cold and quite
moist.
Of an altogether different character is the account
I am about to give. This I have from Dr. Bull and
it dates back to the time when I was working for the
Society. Dr. Bull at that time was enjoying a very
good but most unusual practice. He had been an
intimate friend of Dr. Hyslop, the professor in Co
lumbia University who had been led to accept the
spiritistic hypothesis after a very thorough study of
psychic phenomena. It seemed to Dr. Bull that if a
Christian could believe his New Testament he could
believe that some cases of apparent nervous or mental
disorder are really due to demon possession. His
treatment consisted in having a medium sit beside

sort of an evil spirit was causing his patient's troubles.
Of the many interesting things he told me what I am
about to tell impressed me most.
The doctor became acquainted with a man who had
had practically no educational advantages, but who
did some most remarkable things. At one time he
felt that he was possessed by an ancient Aztec Indian.
He showed me some of the work done by his patient.
I recall some designs for the backs of playing cards.
They were beautifully done. Anyone who had ever
seen the art work of the Aztec could not fail to note
its unique motifs running through the design. Then
the doctor showed me another set of drawings done by
his patient when held captive by the spirit of a de
signer. Here were some very pretty sketches of
scroll work and some designs for screens. Then a
third spirit visited this fortunate or unfortunate man
and it was the spirit of a genius, a painter with imagi
nation and technique. As a sample of this work the
doctor had a large oil painting hanging on the wall.
To me it seemed exquisitely done. It portrayed a
sunset beyond a lake lying deep among towering
mountains. One could see paths running along the
mountainside and these the doctor told me had an
allegorical significance. Follow one and it would lead
you to the heights and out into the light, follow the
other and you would be lost in the deep shadows of

the mountains. So far as I could judge, it was a very
good piece of art, in its colouring, in its symmetry
and in the unity of its conception. Would not it
be splendid if we could have the spirit of a genius
visit us and enable us to do great things without the
long years of tedious preparation?
Speaking of spirit possession suggests a story re
cently acquired. Let me give you a little preparation
for this account. In order to write legibly it is nec
essary to train the muscles in the fingers of the right
hand to make very small and precise movements. It
is no easy task. Long hours are put in by little chil
dren in acquiring this feat. As the fingers obtain
their dexterity a centre in the left hemisphere of the
brain, for right-handed children, is slowly and elab
orately educated. Before anyone can write, this
development must be perfected. Now for the story:
a little child about two years old whose tiny hands
and fingers have the usual childish clumsiness, writes
intelligent sentences, when the old folks are not in
the nursery. Imagine it !
At the time when I collected that gem I obtained
these two. In fact the story of the literary prodigy
brought these two strange narratives to mind.
Again, perhaps a few words of explanation may give
a setting for the stories.
From the most ancient times to the present there
has been a widespread belief that discarnate spirits
could enter into people and even into things. Among

the Babylonians and the Egyptians there are ac
counts of demon possession and methods by which
the evil spirits were driven out. Most of us are
acquainted with the incidents in the New Testament
where evil spirits came out at the word of command.
In the early Christian Era, the Church Fathers tell
us about cases of demon possession and the way in
which they were depossessed. In the Catholic Ency
clopedia there is an interesting article on exorcism,
from which we learn that the present rite of exorcism
agrees with the teachings of the early Church Fathers
and is a proof of the continuity of Catholic tradition.
"According to Catholic belief demons or fallen angels
retain their natural power, as intelligent beings, of
acting on the material universe, and using material
objects and directing material forces for their own
wicked ends; and this power, which is in itself limited
and is subject of course to control of divine Provi
dence, is believed to have been allowed a wider scope
for its activity in consequence of the sin of mankind.
Hence places and things as well as persons are natu
rally liable to diabolical infestation. . .
" This of
course opens up interesting possibilities. Actual ob
jects may be infested with malignant spirits and it
would be necessary to avoid using any such material
in the construction of churches. "The chief things
formally exorcised in blessings are water, salt and oil
and these in turn are used in personal exorcisms and
in blessing or consecrating places, (e.g. churches)

and objects (e.g. altars, sacred vessels, church bells)
connected with public worship." In early times cer
tain men were ordained to exorcise, though anyone
who led a devout life and was a true believer could
adjure the evil spirit to depart by the authority of a
Higher Power.
Out in the wilds among a primitive people, a coura
geous priest is carrying out the duties of his calling.
With a mind stored full of the wisdom and lore of the
past he is trying to instil into the minds of those
simple people the ideals and principles of Christi
anity. Among them he encounters one who speaks
sentences in Greek. This is so foreign to the lan
guage and culture of these aborigines that the good
priest assumes he has a case of spirit possession, simi
lar to those which the church had known all through
the ages. So he proceeded with his ritual to demand
the departure of that linguistic demon.
In spiritualistic circles we sometimes hear of what
is called a "poltergeist." This is a turbulent spirit.
He raises the mischief when he enters the scene. I
once knew a man who thought his father came back
to earth as a "poltergeist." He would do very rude
and uncouth things in the drawing-rooms of cultured
spiritualists. Now it seems that for many years the
Catholic Church has believed that inanimate things
may be animated by wicked spirits and that it is
possible to conjure them away.

her mind to holy meditation she makes little contact
with the outside world. In such an atmosphere as
this comes the "poltergeist" or mischievous demon.
When her meals are brought to her, dishes rise up and
fling themselves on the floor, spoons and saucers
cavort around to the dismay and distress of everyone.
Again the ancient ritual, bearing with it memories
that run back through the Elizabethan Age, when
witches did their wicked work, back through the dark
Middle Ages, with their struggles against the powers
of darkness, back to the early Christians with the
hand outstretched, eyes uplifted and the holy words
of adjuration, comes into action in this scientific
twentieth century.
After those stories about the priests of the Catholic
church, one that I got from a Protestant pastor would
seem to be in order. No starved ascetic was he but
a tremendous man of two hundred and forty pounds,
jolly, good-natured, and thoroughly practical. At
some time in his life he acquired a conviction that he
could trust to his premonitions. Such things as
these would happen : as he coasted down a hill on his
bicycle he had a premonition that the chain was
about to jump off, —after a lapse of a few minutes
off came the chain. Again he had a premonition that
one of the children would hurt his hand, and sure
enough the hand was hurt. His most striking ex
perience happened as follows. With his two boys he

was hurrying to the station in Boston trying to catch
a train for the West, when he pulled out his watch
and discovered that the train had departed. Then
there came to him a deep sense of relief and along
with it a conviction that they had escaped some
danger. He said to the boys that it was a good thing
they had missed the train for he was sure that that
train was going to meet with an accident. Several
days later he happened to meet with one of the
officials of that railroad and told him about missing
the train and the premonition of trouble. This led
to a comparison of notes. And it evolved that the
particular sleeper in which he and the boys had their
reservation did meet with an accident. A freight
train on a siding struck that car and ruined the berths
he reserved. After this he had more confidence in
his premonitions than ever and also he had more
premonitions. Indeed, they became a nuisance; they
beset him all the time. To test their real value he
kept a close record of each premonition and what
happened after. This cured him. He discovered
that he had been taking account of only the few that
came true. These were so striking that he forgot all
about the others.
In sharp contrast with the genial and kindly clergy

names of the horses were listed. There she would
see the name of the winner before it was broadcast
over the country. This advantage of a few minutes
advance information netted some tidy sums to these
gentlemen. Just what went on I could not discover.
Certainly the lady seemed to make a number of
lucky hits, but when she went into her "trance" and
attempted to tell me what she saw my friend doing
some forty miles away, her television apparatus was
certainly out of order.
Even college professors with all their aversion for
superstition occasionally run into a weird experience.
One showed me a clever drawing of his house-front
done by a friend who had never seen the house or
had a description of it. Another told of an aunt who
could gaze into a crystal ball and locate things that
had been lost or misplaced.
Not all of these curious experiences are useless or
impractical. A wealthy gentleman once told me that
he had reason to believe that one of his relatives had
put some valuable papers away very carefully before
he died and had neglected to tell any one where they
were put. Though he had been trained as a lawyer
and was well versed in science he thought he would
take a try with a medium. According to his account
he obtained very specific directions to find the papers
and found them, quite picturesquely, in an old trunk
in an attic. Almost the same story was told me by

CHAPTER VI
MEDIUMS IN GENERAL
When
I assumed my duties at the Society I
began to look for raw material. Nothing can
be done without dependable material. It seemed
that no one in the Society knew of a single medium
whom they could guarantee as honest and trust
worthy. I suggested that we broadcast a letter
among the membership and see what suggestions
might arrive. This, I was told, was too dangerous a
proceeding. Many members had their favorites and
would insist upon a study of mediums who really
had nothing to give. It appeared to be my job to get
out into the highways and byways and discover some
good material.
Taking one of the old magazines published by the
Society I found an interesting account written by one
of the officers of a sitting with a medium. This
seemed to be a good beginning. I found the lady was
a resident of New York and proceeded at once to a
sitting. It was a hot summer night and a very
charming little lady from the South cordially volun
teered to give me some messages. I shall describe
these in a later chapter. My interest was in the
medium: whether her apparent trance was feigned,

whether her replies were spontaneous, whether she
was open to suggestions and would follow the lead
made by my remarks or gestures. Certainly there
was nothing in the situation to command my confi
dence and I left feeling that if this was a sample of
what a high official considered an excellent medium,
I had a hard time ahead of me finding any thing of
interest.
The next experiment was with an English lady
who volunteered the information that she had sat
many times for a London society and had been ac
customed to having a waiting list. It would appear
that Londoners were much more interested in spir
itualism than New Yorkers. She felt that we were
a very mercenary and materialistic people. Her
performance is rather typical of the usual medium.
First, she had to assure me that she did not know
whether she could make any communications or not.
The powers that controlled her were entirely inde
pendent of her efforts. It was also made clear that
if any spirit should begin speaking through her I
should make a prompt reply. Spirits, it seems, are
very sensitive and if one does not get en rapport with
them readily they vanish. After these instructions
she bound a dark cloth around her eyes, breathed
heavily, sighed a few times and began to speak in
what purported to be the broken English of an Indian
maiden. Little Sunbeam undertook to act as a guide
for some friends of mine in the spirit world. Detect

ing my southern accent she furnished me with a
"Mammy." That was a fairly safe venture, but
unfortunately an English coloring entered the picture.
This robust matron was very plump, with shining red
cheeks. She exclaimed, "Do you remember when
you spilled your porridge?" Now that was just too
bad. Several negro mammies who ought to be in
heaven might remember my spilling many things, but
not an English porridge. After this episode I deter
mined to have a little amusement for my two dollars.
Said the medium: "There is a Betty, or a Betsy
here." I sat silent for awhile, looked very serious
and then said in an awed voice, "Is Fred with her?"
This started quite a long explanation of how Fred
had gone over to the spirit land and had met Betsy
there. This apparently caused me a great deal of
surprise and distress. In a whisper I murmured,
"And the baby?" That touched off another explo
sion. Betsy, Fred and the baby were presented in
a happy domestic scene. Fred, it seems, had im
proved his ways and could hardly be recognized as
the Fred who had behaved so badly on this planet.
Needless to say the three characters were fictions of
my imagination. Naturally, I could not make a very
enthusiastic report on this sitting.
Despite the fact that I found this Mrs. Anderson
quite impossible there were several members of the

and correct information that she gave. One very
thorlligent and well educated lady was astonished and
inteoughly convinced by what she heard.
Some sympathetic friends, seeing my despair, in
vited me to some group seances. In this type of
seance the medium has a better opportunity to sub
mit his messages. With a little ambiguity and in
genuity he can say something that must be significant
to some one in the group. His messages come with
much more promptness and certainty when he finds
there are people in the circle who are sympathetic
and responsive. Often he is led to switch from one
hearer to another as someone in the circle exclaims
that that message has a very pertinent meaning and
must be intended for him. In none of these group
seances could I discover anything that any clever per
son could not produce.
Finding New York in the summer of 1926 so very
poorly supplied with good mediums I decided to go
to Lily Dale, near Jamestown, in one of the most
beautiful parts of the state of New York. Here
mediums from all over the country come to a sort of a
Chautauqua. They may be found by the score.
Their signs appear in many windows as you walk
down the cottaged streets. Thinking that seine fish
ing might net me something I decided to go right
down one of the streets, visiting each medium who
had his sign out.

quaint, little, old Irish woman. She had no trouble
in working up a trance. One wrap of a long black
stocking around her eyes and she was ready to go.
She did not bother about working up her trance or
summoning an Indian spirit. She simply settled into
her chair and informed me that my father was there
and had a message for me. He had a great deal of
trouble making himself clear but the upshot of the
matter seemed to be that I ought to go out of the
brick business. By no exercise of my imagination
with symbolism or allegory could I connect this with
teaching psychology in Princeton. However, her
brogue was so delightful that I willingly received
messages from my sainted mother who was enjoying
a vacation at the seashore. This poor, old soul was
simply a humorous Irishwoman who was taking in
a few dollars in an easy way. She was quite typical
of the people on that street, but much more amusing.
At the hotel someone suggested that I visit a
medium whom Conan Doyle had highly recom
mended. I easily found the young lady and read a
letter in her sitting room signed by Conan Doyle,
saying that this medium was of exceptional merit.
Naturally I was prepared for something of genuine
interest. True, she did have an interesting feature.
With her lips very slightly opened she could articulate
very clearly and distinctly. In fact it was very fas
cinating to see her face so immobile and to hear her
voice apparently coming from deep in her throat.

A collar made it impossible for me to see any throat
movements. Of course, the impression she sought to
convey was that she was perfectly inert and that a
spirit was speaking through her lips. The usual
technique was evident. Quite frequently she would
say, "Does this mean anything to you?" or she would
interject, "Do you understand that?" The spirit
claimed to have seen me in a uniform. I decided
to help things along so I remarked, as though rem
iniscing, "That old Captain's uniform!" This was
instantly productive of results. Curiously enough
she promptly gave me the full name of a friend who
had died. She informed me that he had died by my
side in France. There was a slight discrepancy there
as he was a professor in Princeton and had never been
in the army. Keeping this to myself I readily agreed
to his name and his demise. Thus encouraged, she
marshalled a number of men, calling them by their
first names and sketched some gory scenes in France.
One could almost see the gun-flashes and smell the
smoke. This was very diverting to me as I never got
any nearer to France during the war than Mitchell
Field, Long Island, and the only powder I ever smelt
was on the cheeks of the girls in the canteen. Ap
parently Sir Arthur attracted a better grade of spirits.
All of this was very discouraging and I felt that I
had made my trip in vain. However, there was one

correct. Getting acquainted with him well repaid
me for going to Lily Dale.
At the time of my visit there was a very clever
slate-writer by the name of Keeler, who attracted
a great deal of attention. When I visited him I had
on a golf suit and was in quite a cheerful frame of
mind. After scanning my face and figure closely
he said his powers would not work that morning and
that I need not return That was an excellent lesson.
From that time on I dressed very soberly and wore
the mournful look of a man who wants to communi
cate with someone who has "gone before." This re
sulted in a much more cordial welcome among the
mediums.
Another star performer of those days was John
Slater. Apparently he would reach into a receptacle,
pull out an envelope in which a question had been
placed, read the question without opening the envel
ope, give an answer, then tear the envelope open,
scan its contents and toss it aside. He did this with
a great deal of assurance and very clearly impressed
large groups of people. Of course any one who has
read any works on magic knows several ways of
doing this sort of thing.
If you are interested in reading messages in sealed
envelopes to the mystification of your friends, a very
good procedure is this: supply some one in the group
with a single sheet of paper that just fits the envelope,
a soft black pencil and a needle and thread. The

instructions are, write your question on each side of
the sheet, seal the envelope, run the thread through
a number of times and tie the thread in a dozen knots.
You then take the envelope, slip it in your pocket,
where you have a sponge moistened with cologne.
Get the cologne on one surface of the envelope. It
then becomes transparent and the message can easily
be read. I have found a number of people who
wanted to impute psychic powers to me when I per
formed this feat.
On Sundays there would be a large gathering of
people in the center of the place and some medium
would give messages. Here we have much the same
sort of thing that one finds in group seances. Speak
ers can always be confident that what they say will
be true for someone in the audience.
It was my good fortune to sit next to one of the
mediums who gave a long series of messages which
were very well received. She was an elderly woman,
robust, very normal in appearance and very sociable.
Quite easily she drifted into conversation with me,
told me about her life and family. From her early
years she had felt an impulse to turn to anyone and
to say whatever came to her lips. She claimed that
she did not think over what she was about to say but
simply spoke spontaneously whatever occurred to
her. At times the impulse was much stronger and
she had much more confidence than was her usual
experience. I did not have the temerity to inquire

why her messages were all so general and why she
could not mention names or dates in the statements
that came so positively from the dead.
Very frequently I am asked the question "Are
there any honest mediums?" I should say there are
quite a number of honest people who think that they
are mediums. They have some very striking ex
periences. They do see faces that look out of the
wall at them, or appear in the room before them.
They often see figures standing beside the person. In
addition to that many of them hear voices that give
only a few words, leaving them to fill in the meaning.
Some of them carry on conversations with these
strange voices. Before psychiatry had collected and
classified various cases of nervous disorders these
phenomena were very perplexing. Now we know
that there is a gland in the throat known as the
"thyroid" and that it secretes into the blood stream.
Chemical activity throughout the body is largely
regulated by this gland. Physicians can tell whether
it is secreting too much or too little. When it se
cretes too much we have a number of characteristic
effects. Among these is a very much heightened
imagination, which can result in just the sort of ex
periences described. I had an occasion to study such
a case for two years. I found when the secretions of
this gland were diminished that the patient lost the
faculty for seeing faces and hearing voices.

have these vivid experiences and interpret them as
spirit manifestations. It is a quite natural thing to
do. I have a friend who does automatic writing,
an educated and highly intelligent woman. Though
she understands the psychological principle in auto
matic writing, her hand performs so independently
of her thinking that she is often tempted to believe
some other intelligence is directing the pencil. I
venture to say that any normal man who saw quite
clearly a head looking out of the wall would be led
to think that there really was a head there. We all
have ways of checking up on illusions and mistakes
of perception that we make and we can tell pretty well
what is due to our fancies and what is due to facts.
Let something come into our experiences which seems
to come as an actuality and we are very prone to
accept it as such.
Many people in private life admit that they are
mediums and occasionally see a figure that speaks a
message. As they have no mercenary motive and
as they often seem embarrassed by their experience,
we certainly must conclude that they are not frauds.
If one really is determined to study mediums this
would seem to be the best class of people to study.
Unfortunately they are not easy to find. They are
rather sensitive and not particularly keen about
scientific studies.

or awful, one and all they must have a trance. From
a very light trance, hardly detectable, to a condition
of complete helplessness, these mystic states will
range. Some mediums emphasize their trance.
Others put little interest in it; apparently they are
not changed conspicuously by the condition that
allows a discarnate spirit to take possession of their
speech centers! Naturally, among the thinking
mediums quite a little is made of their trance condi
tion. To emphasize the fact that what they are say
ing cannot come from their own minds they will have
various stories to tell about the peculiar condition
into which they lapse. One assured me that he
would lapse into a trance while asleep and wake up
to find himself sprawling on the floor. Another told
me that her trance was very light and that she spoke
her messages somewhat as an ordinary person speaks
without thinking of what they are saying.
Trances appealed to me. Here was something
that I knew a little about, for I had some experience
with the hypnotic trance and had on numerous occa
sions observed the so-called trances incident to some
mental disorders. If there were such a thing as a
medium trance it seemed to me that it might resemble
the kind of a condition that we find in hypnosis. Let
us make some comparisons.

cooperation. Suggest to him that he cannot lower
his upraised hand. Repeat this a number of times.
Then tell him to try to lower his hand. He cannot
do it. Often this simple experiment is successful.
Nevertheless I have seen a professional hypnotist
work for twenty minutes with a medical student who
wished to be hypnotized, but without any success.
Now the only point I wish to make here is that no
one simply drops into the hypnotic trance as a natural
or common experience. It is artificial and induced.
On the other hand, the mediums who have dis
cussed the matter with me suggested that their
trances were something supernormal and that they
had come without the aid of any other person. From
their descriptions it would seem that they had some
peculiar trait, different from that other mortals pos
sessed, and the trance came easily and naturally to
them. Certainly they claimed to drop off into a
trance at any time convenient for them. Only after
being hypnotized many times can a subject hypnotize
himself. Such subjects will occasionally go into a
trance involuntarily. Perhaps they have been hyp
notized frequently with the aid of some bright shiny
object. Sudden appearances of bright shiny objects
will occasionally throw them into the trance. Never
have I heard of a medium who had any troubles of
this sort.
To get a subject out of a deep trance it is often
necessary to suggest to him that he is waking up.

You can note by his breathing how he slowly comes
out of the hypnotic state. Never shall I forget the
first man whom I hypnotized. So deep did he go
that I could not wake him by clapping my hands or
shouting in his ear. It was an awful moment. Prob
ably several minutes were spent in trying to bring
him out. Contrast this with the way in which a
medium snaps out of what is apparently a state of
coma. He may be lolling in his chair, an inert figure
breathing very deeply, but a suspicious movement
of a sitter will bring him out with startling rapidity.
It has not been my good fortune to find mediums
who would allow me to experiment with their trance
states. One, however, I shall never forget. She
had fascinated some devotees of the race track. Her
forte was to go into a trance and to see what horses were
winning on distant tracks. Her advance information
seemed to pay better than the usual "dope sheets."
Voluntarily she undertook to go into her trance and
tell me what a friend was doing in a distant city. I
seated her by a window and told her that the room
was dark and then turned her head to the bright side
of the room to see if my suggestion affected her iris
reflex. It did not. Possibley I should not mention
this as the conditions were all very poor and neither
my suggestion nor the light might have been adequate
to prevent the reflex.

a person is really in the hypnotic trance and subject
to the will of another person. Suggestions which
make a person do things that he cannot do of his own
volition are the best evidence. Thus I have seen a
boy told that he was in the sun on a hot day and he
broke out in a perspiration. Another youngster was
told that the lobe of his ear was very cold and that
there was no blood in it. When a needle was thrust
through the lobe not a drop of blood exuded. These
are rather drastic measures. However, the medium
who insists that his body and brain are at the disposal
of some vigorous spirit and compares his condition
to that of a subject controlled by a hypnotist should
be willing and should be able to prove it by just such
tests.
Comparing the ostensible trances of mediums with
those of hypnotized persons there are some rather
obvious differences. In hypnosis the subject is often
responsive to just one person, refusing to take direc
tions from anyone except the person who has put him

purpose. Mediums, however, slip from the direction
of one spirit to another. Moreover the hypnotist
can make various portions of his subject's skin in
sensitive, or can throw him into a catatonic state with
ease. Never have I seen any spirit attempt such a
thing with a medium, though I have known one me

disposal of the spirit who possessed her and main
tained that she was in a state quite similar to the
hypnotic state.
So far as my observations are concerned I must say
that the mediums whom I have observed do not seem
to resemble, in their trances, any of the genuine
trances I have been able to study with hypnotic sub
jects or nervous patients.
Many of the rules of the seance are very amusing.
One is that a group of sitters shall arrange themselves
in a circle and join hands. In addition to this they
should keep both feet resting on the floor. By way of
explanation, the medium points out that the power
which is to produce the phenomena is something like
electricity. Hence it is necessary to complete the
circuit and let the power flow from person to person.
Inasmuch as electrical currents often have to be
grounded the feet must rest upon the floor. If you
have sat in such a circle you must have noticed that
vou cannot do much exploring with your hands and
feet kept in such positions. Never did I realize the
value of grounding the current so strongly as on one
eventful night. Tired and bored with a seance that
was dragging, I had tilted my chair back and crossed
my knees. The tip of my toe came in contact with
the medium who was crawling about the circle.
Another rule is that there must be music or songs.
Most amazing is the explanation for this. We are
told that psychic power comes in vibrations, resem

bling the Hertzian waves that play our radios. To
catch these waves we must have waves in the air of
the room. To prove this the phenomena often occur
when the songs are loudest. Such a little discrepancy
as the fact that the radio waves travel in the ether
and the sound waves travel in the air does not bother
the spiritualist. Again I learned to appreciate the
value of this rule when I conducted a seance of my
own. If you have to leave your seat and fix a few
gadgets the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" is an in
valuable friend to cover any noises that you have to
make.
Good mediums are artists in timing their phenom
ena. Things happen when the sitter's attention is
directed to a lively conversation or engrossed in try
ing to remember and sing a hymn. I did not dare to
show an apparition in my seance at any other time
than the moments when my group was somewhat pre
occupied. A circle of people all intent and alert to
observe what a medium is doing will kill any seance.
Darkness is an indispensable requirement in many
seances. Sometimes the dark is not complete.
Nothing is more difficult than to shut out every little
leak of light. So a partial darkness where one can
dimly see the outlines of other sitters is sometimes
quite sufficient. Occasionally mediums insist upon
absolute darkness. Then the blackness is so com
plete you can pass your hand before your eyes and
detect no difference in the darkness. Explanations

for this requirement are about as follows. Psychic
forces are akin to light but not so strong and the light
destroys them. Dr. Crandon, the husband of the
famous medium Margery, declared that it was as
absurd to expect psychic phenomena in a strong light
as to expect that you could develop a sensitive photo
graphic plate with the sun shining on it. He main
tained that there is a law governing the psychic
phenomena and we must conform to it if we are to
have results. This, he claimed, is a demand no more
unreasonable than what is imposed upon us in all
branches of science.
One cannot help thinking that, if it is possible for
a spirit or a group of vibrations to take possession of
a medium who delivers messages in a well lighted
room, it or they really need not operate in the dark.
Scepticism of these psychic laws increases when we
note that the movement of trumpets and the touches
of spirit hands only occur in deep darkness.
Darkness certainly has a valuable psychological
effect for the spiritualist. Many people become
nervous and apprehensive in the dark. Once I sat
next to a Chicago business man who seemed to have a
great deal of poise and confidence before the lights
went out, but when the darkness fell his assurance
dropped. The hand that held mine shook as though
he had paralysis agitans. On another occasion a
rather nervous lady about rubbed the skin off of my
knuckes as she twisted her ringed fingers around mine.

they are in no frame of mind to understand what is
going on about them. In one pitch black room I
have known a young college girl to become so excited
that she thought she was going into a trance and had
to be taken out.
Some very clever work and very puzzling can be
done by a good medium in the dark. I have had my
eyebrow gently stroked by a medium who was so
alert that when I thrust my head forward to reach his
hand it was gone. Really it is quite disconcerting
to sit in an absolutely dark room and feel a pair of
cold clammy fingers pinch your ear. I must admit
that the precision of these movements in the dark
puzzled me for some time. When a trumpet can
touch you lightly on the edge of your eyeglass and
then move deftly away you cannot help feeling that
someone who can see in the dark is moving that
trumpet. But you know no one can see in the dark.
When there is no light to be focussed no human nor
animal eye can see. Quite a few of my very sceptical
and critical friends confess their puzzlement about
these experiences. My first insight into how they
were done was supplied by Mrs. Houdini, who told
me that such a knack can be acquired by anyone who
will take the trouble to experiment in the dark. Of
course you cannot see; but, with a little practice, you
can locate a person very nicely by the sound of their
breathing. Then if you are determined to become
an artist in this sort of thing you can by constant
practice determine where your sitter is and where his

ears and nose can be found without fumbling. I
found that by putting a medium's trumpet to my
ear I could locate a sitter quite nicely, as it caught
the faint sounds of his breathing and indicated his
position by the direction it pointed.
Assuming that some mediums are honest and gen
uine it would be interesting to compare them with
normal human beings. Many studies have been
made of the inheritance of insanity, genius and special
talents. Taking my cue from this I made it a prac
tice to ask each medium if there were any members of
his family who had "psychic powers." I was fre
quently told that a parent, grandparent, aunt or
uncle had some such power. I cannot say that there
is anything conclusive in this little investigation.
It is merely suggestive. Everyone knows how diffi
cult it is for social workers to get adequate infor
mation about several generations of any family. In
my cases I was dealing with people who were certainly
not very dependable. Some of them may have felt
that their own abilities would be enhanced in my
opinion if they came from a family of psychics.
However, I did carry away the impression that some
of the more frank and sincere mediums were telling
the truth and doing so intelligently. If it should
prove to be true that the ability to see visions and
hear messages is hereditary, it would seem to indicate
that conditions in the thyroid gland may be of an
hereditary character.

CAN SPIRITS GO CRAZY?
When
I first began reading stenographic notes
of what mediums had said I had a curious feel
ing. Though I had not seen a medium for twenty
years and had no idea of how they expressed them
selves when I began my work for the Society, I found
that there was something strikingly familiar in the
character of the messages I read. At first I could not
quite recall what experiences could give rise to this
feeling of familiarity that I had in reading steno
graphic reports of a seance. Then it suddenly
dawned on me. These disconnected ideas and
strange twisting and turning of the attention from
one notion to another was just the thing that one
noticed with a number of mental patients. When a
case of schizophrenia is communicative and has not
reached too advanced a stage of dementia, one hears
just the sort of thing that many a medium gives.
Here is a sample of the statements of a medium who
was acceptable to so experienced a connoiseur as

SEANCE I
At Dr. Bull's office
October 7, 1926
2.45 P.M.
Present: Mrs. D. (Medium), Dr. McComas, Dr. Bull, and
Recorder.
Mrs. D. (Impressions —Long pause). Very many impres
sions are flowing in, but rather crossed at the moment. As I
first shook hands with the gentleman a little lady of unusual
sweetness manifested, with the remark "A lady of fifty years
ago." I didn't see her in vision, but knew she was small, and
that although very kind, sweet and gentle in her dealings, that
underneath it were the foundations of character and a firm
faith in God, that nothing could shake. She didn't hesitate
to speak her mind in the same gentle way, but decidedly, where
matters of principle were concerned. As I stepped into the
room and sat down, I was flashed an Indian of the early type
in America. When I asked why, the answer was that the ances
tors of the gentleman were almost as much entitled to American
claim as the force. I don't get on which side. The next
indistinct impression was a man saying, "If I offer you an olive
branch, will that connect as a slight cross-reference to some
thing I previously said?" Now that was a little indistinct, and
I would rather go into it a little deeper. (Turns away from
light and covers eyes) A man a little heavier-set than the
Professor, and possibly slightly shorter, dressed in black, with
clothes that show, across the abdomen, a loss of weight, who
was troubled with his breathing and says: "Son, I am trying to
keep my word, my promise." Whether this is in relationship I
do not know. I go now to a study. I am attempting to
compile something and at times, take out volumes quite bulky.
As I enter into this as a vibration, my back tingles, and all
down my arms; and with it also comes a heaviness with my
head. At times everything moves rapidly in this work, and

with amazingly clear glimpses, and insights which I almost
feel are all my own. At other times this heaviness comes over
me and I am unable to concentrate and continue with the
work. I work in two different lines, one in which I am supposed
to be more competent to work and express myself. In the other
I feel unworthy, and yet impelled by a sense of both duty and
an urge; a duty to three people to do justice to these people.
I have read extensively of records, both published and unpub
lished; some concerning a man whom I knew, and others con
cerning a man whom I did not know in life but whom I admire;
and wish to carry on in whatever way I may be able to help.
As one nears the meridian of life one is not so much concerned
of devoting himself to a work that, to certain people, lacks
scientific standards. In the thirties such things loom big;
but around fifty—I hear fifty-six but am not sure—one is more
interested in the vital meaning of life itself; not, as our oppo
nents think, because one foot is slipping. A change of control.
It is J. H.
Compare that with the following stenographic re
port from a patient at the Sheppard-Enoch Pratt
Hospital kindly loaned me by Dr. G. Wilson Shaffer.
"There is something interesting going on here. A little
girl over in the Casino reminds me of some Syrians I knew in
California. One of these did a carving in mother-of-pearl of
the 'Last Supper.' Any one interested in this type of girl
would remind me of these people. The mothers of these Syrian
rug dealers would adopt these girls and try to find their rela
tives. These vibrations are not entirely clear. There are
vibrations in the room all the time. I do not know the purpose
or where they come from. That girl interests me and reminds

when I walked on them and they do sometimes here. The
vibration sounds seem to work around one. I don't hear
definite voices, they just work around me. For instance, in
Harper's Bazaar there is a picture of Eva La Gallienne. This
business has gone on for six months. Sister had to move twice
because of it. I think father's money had something to do
with it. There is that picture of the negress kneeling beside a
bed. I have seen my sister's maid kneel that way. I think
it was her—she said at that time there were what about
that negro woman and the white mistress. The words do not
matter, it is the tone of voice. What about the woman who
had an affair with her negro chauffeur. They trained a big
bird to fly out at the chauffeur. I don't see why they said
that about my chauffeur. My sister fell in love with her Irish
chauffeur and wanted to marry him. The newspapers and
charitable organizations have something to do with it. This
has nothing to do with a chaise lounge or affaire de coeur.
I have heard that for six months through vibrations. The
vibrations come from across the way by means of a music box.
The words are translated to me and ask 'how old are you?'
Have you had your breakfast? They come in layers through
atmosphere charged with electricity. Two types of people are
constantly going in and out, the 'guinea pig' and the 'monkey
type.' All of the larger cities in the country are having trouble
with people copying other people's writing. I haven't written
a thing in three years—everything is printed. I would rather
go to Atlanta and hear the vibrations than not be able to attend
to my affairs. I know they are operating on patients down
stairs without narcotics. I know my mother is downstairs.
My baby is on some ward being tortured. The Russians are
responsible. The 'impressions' say that a Russian nobleman
is the cause of it all. There are poisonous and gaseous fumes
about here. The lost steel plates are important to both the
German Government and the U. S. International peace is

ment. There will be a serious airplane disaster shortly—five

One of three conclusions may be drawn from the
character of messages of this type. First, the me
dium may be cleverly casting about touching upon
all sorts of topics in the hope of catching her hearer's
interest. Second, the medium may lapse into a rev
erie and allow all sorts of disconnected things to run
through her mind. If she is hyperthyroid she may
see faces and hear voices which will accentuate her
peculiarities. Third, if the spiritualist is right, the
visiting spirit has clearly gone crazy.

CHAPTER VIII
A DE LUXE CASE
Nearly
all the interesting cases that appear in
the literature have to do with people in a rather
lowly station in life with little education and fre
quently very stupid. Moreover, it has always seemed
just about impossible to make good and continuous
observations of what they said and did. As a result
we have a great mass of reports that really get no
where. Imagine then the delight of everyone in
terested in psychic research the world over when a
surgeon in Boston announced to the world that his
wife was a genuine psychic. At last there had come
the great occasion that everyone directly or remotely
interested in psychic phenomena had long desired.
Now it seemed that the scientific world could really
get an insight into the curious things that men like
Crookes, Lodge, Richet and James had been writing
about; for surely a man who boasted descent from the
passengers on the Mayflower, who graduated from
Harvard, who had the Harvard medical degree and
was an instructor in surgery in that university for a
number of years could be counted upon to take and
maintain a really scientific attitude. No other r61e
could be played by a man who was known as the

author of a book on surgical after-treatment, who was
a consulting surgeon for several hospitals and a Fel
low of the American College of Surgeons. So it
seemed.
After I had had a few conversations with several
of the leading members in the Society this Boston
case was described to me. I had known something of
it from newspaper articles. The Scientific American
had offered a prize to anyone who could exhibit some
psychic phenomena which could not be explained in
terms of principles which were already known. Dr.
Crandon entered his wife as a candidate and a very
dignified group of men acted as judges: William
McDougall, Professor of Psychology at Harvard,
D. F. Comstock, of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, H. Houdini, the famous magician, W. F.
Prince, then Research Officer of The American So
ciety for Psychical Research, Mr. Hereward Carring-
ton, author of books on spiritualism, and a Mr. J. M.
Bird, who acted as secretary to this committee.
What really impressed the public was that some of
the men whose judgment was respected felt that they
could not declare themselves and that they were
frankly puzzled. That Houdini should declare
against the genuineness of the phenomena was not
surprising. That Carrington and Bird should be
favorably impressed was not surprising. That men
like McDougall, Comstock and Prince should be puz
zled and wish for a further investigation was indeed

interesting. It was the uncertainty of these men that
led to wide publicity for the case and attracted a
number of people to the famous little house at Num
ber 10 Lime Street. Articles appeared from time to
time in the newspapers and magazines and an inter
esting book was written by Bird describing the
strange happenings in the doctor's home.
In Conan Doyle's History of Spiritualism he speaks
with enthusiasm of Mrs. Crandon.
"No account of physical mediumship would be complete
which did not allude to the remarkable results obtained by
'Margery,' the name adopted for public purposes by Mrs.
Crandon, the beautiful and gifted wife of one of the first sur
geons in Boston. The lady showed psychic powers some years
ago, and the author was instrumental in calling the attention
of The Scientific American Committee to her case. By doing
so he most unwillingly exposed her to much trouble and worry
which were borne with extraordinary patience by her husband
and herself. It was difficult to say which was the more annoy
ing, Houdini, the conjurer, with his preposterous and ignorant
theories of fraud, or such 'scientific' sitters as Professor Mac-
Dougall of Harvard, who after fifty sittings and signing as
many papers at the end of each sitting to endorse the wonders
recorded, was still unable to give any definite judgment, and
contented himself with vague innuendos. The matter was not
mended by the interposition of Mr. E. J. Dingwall, of the
London S. P. R., who proclaimed the truth of the mediumship
in enthusiastic private letters, but denied his conviction at
public meetings. These so-called 'experts' came out of the
matter with little credit, but more than two hundred common-
sense sitters had wit enough and honesty enough to testify
truly as to what occurred before their eyes. The author may

add that he has himself sat with Mrs. Crandon and has satisfied
himself, so far as one sitting could do so, as to the truth and
rangeof her powers." (A. C. Doyle, The History of Spiritualism,
Vol. 2, pp. 219-220.)
From this quotation it is easily seen what bitterness
grew up among those who endorsed Margery toward
those who could not agree with them.
In another place in his history Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle, M.D., LI.D., expresses himself even more
vigorously.
"What may be called a collective investigation of a medium,
Mrs. Crandon, the wife of a doctor in Boston, was undertaken
in the years 1923-1925 by a committee chosen by The Scientific
American and afterwards by a small committee of Harvard
men, with Dr. Shapley, the astronomer, at their head. It may
be briefly stated that of The Scientific American inquirers the
secretary, Mr. Malcolm Bird, and Dr. Hereward Carrington
announced their complete conversion. The others gave no
clear decision which involved the humiliating admission that
after numerous sittings under their own conditions and in the
presence of constant phenomena, they could not tell whether
they were being cheated or not. The defect of the committee
was that no experienced spiritualist who was familiar with
psychic conditions was upon it. Dr. Prince was very deaf,
while Dr. MacDougall was in a position where his whole aca
demic career would obviously be endangered by the acceptance
of an unpopular explanation. The same remark applies to
Dr. Shapley's committee, which was all composed of budding
scientists. Without imputing conscious mental dishonesty,
there is a sub-conscious drag towards the course of safety.

escence at each sitting with the result, and their final verdict of
fraud, one cannot discover any normal way in which they have
reached their conclusions. On the other hand, the endorse
ments of the mediumship by folk who had no personal reasons
for extreme caution were frequent and enthusiastic. Dr. Mark
Richardson, of Boston, reported that he had sat more than
three hundred times, and had no doubt at all about the results.
The author has seen numerous photographs of the ectoplasmic
flow from 'Margery,' and has no hesitation, on comparing it
with similar photographs taken in Europe, in saying that it is
unquestionably genuine, and that the future will justify the
medium against her unreasonable critics." (A. C. Doyle,
History of Spiritualism, Vol. 1, pp. 328-329.)
So said Conan Doyle. One wonders what Sherlock
Holmes would have said.
Indeed, the case of Margery loomed so large in
spiritualist circles that it dominated everything else.
Everywhere in psychic research literature one found
Margery the outstanding character. At the Ameri
can Society for Psychical Research it was frequently
said that Margery was the climax. With her the
case for spiritualism would be won or lost. Enthu
siastic believers quoted her seances with conviction.
All that was needed they felt was a fair, scientific
investigation and the cause of spiritualism would be
established for all time. On the other hand, if it
was proven that Margery's phenomena were done by
trickery, psychic research would receive a blow from
which it would never recover. So said one of the
oldest members to me.

A DE LUXE CASE 115
Those who are interested in a detailed account of
the origin and development of the Margery case up
to 1925 will find the book entitled Margery by J.
Malcolm Bird very interesting. It is written from
the point of view of one who believed in the spiritistic
hypothesis. It is written in a style to give the im
pression that the observations are critically and scien
tifically made and that the evidence was so great
that one was forced to the belief that trickery must
be ruled out, at least in a number of important in
stances.
We are not interested to review all the literature
on the Margery case, the attacks and the defense.
Here is presented only my own experiences and im
pressions.
At the Society I met two very able lawyers, men
whose judgment any one could respect. In careful
and guarded statements they described to me their
impressions of the Crandons and what was going on
at Number 10 Lime Street. Naturally I was very
keen to get to Boston as soon as possible. Very
kindly they made arrangements and I obtained my
entree to the famous seances.
At that time a typical seance was about as follows.
One was taken to the fourth floor and shown the room
where the seances were held. On one side stood a
large glass cabinet of sufficient size to enable Mrs.
Crandon to be seated comfortably within it. Small
windows were cut through the walls at a convenient

height so her hands could be thrust through and any
one who wished could satisfy themselves that her
hands were in the positions where they had been
fastened at the beginning of the seance. Staples were
placed in the floor and her feet were securely fastened
to them. When the door was closed the medium was
shut off from the circle except by way of the two ex
posed hands.
Another cabinet made of cloth over a secure frame
work was opened on one side only. This enabled the
medium to make contact with the circle and also with
a small table which was placed in front of the cabinet.
Other objects of interest to the visitor were a small
"bell-box" and an elaborate "voice cut-out." The
bell-box was simply constructed and contained dry-
cell batteries and a little electric bell. The box could
be closed tightly and a flap hinged to the top could
be pressed down against a spring until two contacts
came together, which rang the bell. It was all very
simple and a high school boy could easily understand
it. The voice cut-out was more complicated. It
consisted of a long glass tube bent in the shape of the
letter U, which stood in an upright position. It was
half filled with water and two corks floated on the
surface of the water in each arm of the tube. The
corks were painted with luminous paint so they could
be seen in the dark. Attached to one arm of the U-
tube was a heavy rubber tube, so constructed that it
could not be squeezed to prevent the passage of air.

A DE LUXE CASE 117
When one blew through the rubber tube the water
went down in one arm of the U-tube and up in the
other. In the dark you could easily see the two
corks move from a position where they were side by
side to one in which one cork was much higher than
the other. As long as one continued to blow against
the water column the corks would maintain their
uneven position. Instead of holding the end of the
rubber tube in the mouth a glass mouthpiece, fitted
on the tube, was held in the mouth. This was built
with three openings. Each Up covered an opening
and the tongue covered the third opening. If either
lip or the tongue slipped from their openings air would
enter the tube and the corks would drop back to their
even position. Thus in the dark one could see
whether the person whose voice was being controlled
moved the tongue or lips.
Visitors were encouraged to examine the cabinets
and to experiment with the bell-box and voice cut
out. They were invited to explore the room and to
satisfy themselves that there were no trick gadgets
concealed anywhere.
At seances where there were critical visitors Mar
gery was stripped before entering the seance room and
searched to make sure that she had no reaching rod
or other device concealed on her. Then led by two
investigators she would be brought to the glass cabi
net and her hands and feet lashed with picture wire
which was securely fastened to prevent slipping.

118 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
After she was comfortably seated a small basket
which had been daubed with luminous paint was
placed between her feet in the cabinet. Spectators
could easily see the spots of luminous paint on the
basket, though everything else was completely invis
ible in the dark. After a few minutes the lights
could be seen to rise, sway back and forth, and then
go flying into the back of the cabinet. It was claimed
that this was done by ectoplasm, which came from
the medium's person and exuded from some orifice,
ear, nose, mouth, etc. Then the door was opened
and a small container was placed before the medium
holding a number of carved wooden letters. These
would be tossed out to the sitters in the circle.
A hoarse whisper could be heard coming from the
cabinet which would say, for example, "Here is an M
for you, Dr. Mac." And I would find a little wooden
M by my feet.
More impressive than the basket and the letters
was the voice cut-out. It was placed before the me
dium and the nipple inserted in her mouth. Then
the corks would change position, showing that she
had blown into the tube and was holding her lips and
tongue stationary. During this time "Walter"
would indulge in some remarks, possibly he would
carry on a conversation with sitters in the circle.
After these performances in the closed cabinet the
medium would take her seat in the open cabinet.

placed. Sitters were distributed in a circle around
the table and would often be called upon to "control"
the medium and each other. Such a control often
consisted of someone's sitting next to Margery hold
ing her hand and keeping one foot upon one of her
feet. Then hands were joined around the circle
reaching to the sitter on the other side of Margery
who maintained a similar "control." Frequently no
such procedure was followed and all hands and feet
were free.
While the medium was in the open cabinet a sitter
would often ask "Walter" to ring two shorts and one
long with the box, or any signal which occurred to
mind. Promptly the bell-box responded with the
signal requested. This was done many times to the
delight and bewilderment of the sitters. Then
Walter would say "Turn on the red light, pick up the
box, carry it over to the light, turn around to show
there are no strings tied to it and bring it quickly
back to the table and I will make it ring all the time
it is off the table." This performance usually went
forward just as Walter predicted.
With this same arrangement of medium and sitters
Walter did one of his most choice acts. So convinc
ing was this performance that one of the leading law
yers in New York and a professor of philosophy from
Princeton declared that it was the nearest approach
to something supernormal they had ever encountered
and they were somewhat inclined to think that only

the spiritistic hypothesis could explain it. It con
sisted in drawing a card from a pack which had not
been opened until taken into the dark room and toss
ing it on the table without knowing what it was,
whereupon Walter would tell them what the card was
and to remember what he had said. When the light
was turned on each card would be found named cor
rectly. To introduce a little innovation the professor
of philosophy wrote on one of the cards with a blue
pencil and Walter told him what was written. All
of this was done very promptly in a room which was
absolutely dark. Walter's explanation was that he
felt the cards with his ectoplasmic rod.
Once in a while this arrangement of sitters and
cabinet was used to experiment with the ectoplasm.
A plaque made luminous with a little luminous paint
would be placed on the table and a dark object could
be seen protruding over the plaque coming from the
direction of the medium.
All that is just a sketch of an evening with Marg
ery. In fact it is nothing more than the outlines of
a sketch. It does not carry any good portrayal of
a seance. To get that it is necessary to fill in and
make a more complete picture. Imagine yourself
invited to one of Dr. Crandon's evenings, including
an invitation to dinner. Down in an old historic
section of Boston you would find his house, suggest

yourself face to face with a handsome, middle-aged
surgeon who knew the secret of hospitality and put
you quickly at ease. Something about the pleasant
expression in his blue-gray eyes that looked so clearly
and honestly in yours would suggest to you other
men of his profession of character and ability. If
you had come prepared to be critical and hostile you
would find it hard to keep that attitude towards so
charming a gentleman.
When Mrs. Crandon was presented she would com
pletely upset all preconceptions of the famous me
dium. A very attractive blonde with a charming
expression and excellent figure the "Witch of Lime
Street" proved to be a thoroughly feminine lady with
the best traits of a mother and housekeeper. Her
vivacity, with the doctor's poise and dignity, made
them a delightf ul pair for an enjoyable dinner. Both
had a very diverting sense of humor and the conver
sation would never lag.
After the meal, which frequently involved a little
wine that warmed your heart, you would be invited
into the library. There the atmosphere was that of
literary Boston—comfortable chairs, books every
where. Probably the doctor would call you aside and
tell you that he wished to show you some interesting
photographs. As he showed you some excellent pic
tures of his wife with "ectoplasm" coming from her

things which had been happening in his home. With
a quiet, well-modulated voice he might tell you how
the mediumship started a few years before in a simple
experiment with table tipping. Then he might go
on explaining how the table would rap out answers
to questions. Several spirits seemed to be present,
among them Walter Stinson, his wife's brother, who
had been killed in a railroad accident about fifteen
years before. Gradually Walter dominated the
evenings. After some experiments he succeeded in
taking possession of his sister. He would not use
her voice but managed a device of his own which was
apparently attached to the side of his sister's head,
as the "voice cut-out" made speech by Mrs. Crandon
impossible. If all of this impressed you sufficiently
the doctor might continue by telling you of such
strange things as these:
When a basin of liquid paraffine had been put in
the seance room they would occasionally find a per
fect paraffine glove, as though someone had thrust a
hand into the paraffine, and drawn it out with a thin
coating over it and the wrist. No human hand could
be slipped out of such a glove without tearing the
wrist. Only a hand that is at one time material and
at another immaterial could make such a glove ! On
another occasion they put a chemical scale in the
room, weighted one pan and found that the other
pan, though empty, would be thrust down lifting up
the weighted pan. On another occasion Margery

wrote quite sensible sentences in languages she did
not understand. When all of these experiments had
been carefully explained by the doctor he would prob
ably add that he was delighted to have you share his
interest and would be more than delighted if you
could offer some explanation of them.
Probably while the doctor was talking with you
some of his friends would drop in for the seance of the
evening. You might meet Dr. Mark A. Richardson,
who had some reputation for work he had done on
typhoid vaccination. You could not fail to like him.
A representative of New England's best ideals would
be the impression he would give you. Certainly you
would not be led by what you knew of his career or
by his manner and conversation to think of him as a
magician's assistant. Nor would his wife give rise
to any such idea. Certainly the portly and genial
old gentleman they would present as Judge Hill
would seem the very antithesis of a master of tricks.
Also a Dr. Brown would add to the general impression
that you were in a company of intelligent and respon
sible people. Perhaps if you met Mr. Dudley you
might think him a little too reticent, but if you en
gaged him in conversation you would soon see that
he had the scientific training and point of view.

ing evening. In the dark room you would meet the
most intriguing personality of all. True, he would be
only a husky whisper. But what he could whisper!
The most curious twists and turns ran into his dia
logues. When my full name was given, with the
middle name of Clay, Walter promptly exclaimed,
"No, I am clay." Few people ever dared to engage
in an exchange of wits with Walter. Just as the
Elsie voice built up into a personality with Car-
theuser, so did Walter at Lime Street.
As you would leave late in the evening after saying
good-bye to your new and interesting friends, you
would probably find your thoughts taking one of two
directions. If you had felt kindly toward the spir
itistic interpretation of the things you had read about
in psychic research you would probably say to your
self : "This is the best argument for my belief that I
have ever found." If, on the other hand, your train
ing and habits of thinking made spiritualism impos
sible you would say to yourself: "What under the
sun are these people up to? Are they planning to
make a grand expose of the spiritualists by presenting
the greatest show of all and then explaining it? May
be they are just having some fun, for the evening
was full of amusing incidents, —could that be it?"
Such questions as these were undoubtedly in the
minds of the officers of the American Society for
Psychical Research, for they were anxious to have a
committee to study the Margery case fully and fairly.

They felt that the preceding investigations had not
led to definite conclusions. So I was assigned the
task of making up such a committee. After several
conferences I succeeded in getting Professor Knight
Dunlap of the Johns Hopkins University and Profes
sor Robert W. Wood of the same university to agree
to serve with me. Professor Dunlap is one of the
outstanding psychologists in America with a genius
for experimental work which is second to none, a
man of many interests and the author of numerous
well-known books in his science. Professor Wood
is one of the greatest physicists in America. His
brilliant experiments in electricity and light have
given him an international reputation. Like his col
league, Professor Dunlap, his interests and activities
reach out beyond his science. It would have been
impossible to find two men famous in the scientific
world better adapted for this sort of an investigation.
The Society saw this at once and the Commission was
appointed.
After a conference with Dr. Crandon an agreement
was made to the effect that the sittings should take
place in Boston, subject to cancellations "when the
psychic's health makes it necessary." Dictated
notes were to be taken during each seance of what was
being observed, or of any comments. "Claims or
suggestions of fraud in the production of phenomena
which do not appear in these notes shall be deemed
excluded from consideration." Dr. Crandon, Dr.

Richardson or some other physician was to be present
as a medical attendant to the psychic. No "psychic
structure" could be touched and no light could be
turned on without the consent of Walter.
It is easy to see the difficulties these rules imposed
upon the investigators. With Dr. Crandon or Dr.
Richardson present there was obviously the possi
bility of a confederate to assist the medium in her
performance. With the investigators limited to the
dictation of Walter in the use of light and in handling
the so-called ectoplasm they were badly hampered.
The requirement to dictate everything observed, and
to exclude any observations, not so dictated, from a
final appraisal of the case was very bad. If an in
vestigator noticed something suspicious and men
tioned it to the stenographer, naturally the medium
or the confederate would be apprised. Moreover,
each investigator knew that if he dictated some of
the things he observed the possibilities of his return
ing for another investigation would be very remote.
No one could feel free to dictate exactly as he pleased.
Furthermore, it is a serious distraction to dictate
when making a close observation. In addition to all
that it is not very pleasant to have to put your name
to a document, thus endorsing
it,

caps the Commission determined to go ahead with the

and foot. Notice that this does not appear in the
notes. We simply forgot to dictate it to the stenog
rapher. When I assumed this position I closed my
fingers around Mrs. Crandon's left hand. Nothing
happened. Gradually I released my control of her
hand and let my hand encircle her wrist. This of
course enabled her to use her left hand and I could
detect the play of her fingers by the ripple of the
muscles in the wrist. And now and then those mus
cles rippled. After awhile we were rewarded with
phenomena. Could I have dictated that into the

My control at present
is,
my right knee
against Psyche's left knee, my left
ankle against her right ankle and
my fingers around her wrist.
Dr. Wood suggested that the Psyche's
knees be in contact with each other
and
it
was done. Dr. Crandon said
this would probably prevent the
protrusion of the Psyche's telepathic
rods which are supposed to issue
from the thigh.
The control of the two knees by my
right hand has been discontinued.
Psyche breathing hard, squeezing my
hand.
Psyche's left ankle raised into my lap,
my right hand upon Psyche's knee
and
I
am holding her hand.
Walter said, "No she isn't. Hold your
horses." My control consists in
holding Psyche's left hand and
Psyche's feet are in my lap.
I
am holding Psyche's right hand, rest
ing slightly above her knee and her
right foot
is
now on my left foot.
Walter evidently trying to get force
enough to do something. He says,
"I never saw such
a
bunch of stiffs
in all my life." He also says, "Talk
about dead people; my Godl"
Some conversation between Walter and
different members of the circle.
"Not to be published," says Walter.

Dr. Dunlap 10.26 I have Psyche's right hand in my left
hand, held upward in the air and it

Dr. McComas 10.30 Something cold and moist slapped me
on my hand. Just a moment after,
Dr. Dunlap remarked that some
thing cold struck him on the hand.
I have both of Psyche's ankles in
my lap.
Dr. McComas 10.31 My hand just came in contact with a
small ribbed substance which was
immediately removed from my hand.
I have Psyche's left hand in my right.

Dr. Dunlap 10.31 Psyche's right leg on my lap. Some
thing cold tapped me on the finger.

me on thumb and immediately dis
appeared. Psyche's head constantly

will show you in a minute."
Dr. McComas 10.38 The rod-like structure moved the
doughnut a couple of inches toward
Dr. Wood.
Dr. McComas 10.40 Apparently, rod-like structure is lying
right across doughnut. Dr. Mc

cylindrical something.
Dr. McComas 10 . 42 Psyche reached over and pressed the
back of Dr. McComas' hand on a
cold, moist substance.
Dr. McComas 10.45 Dr. McComas' hand directed to the
substance which he holds between
thumb and forefinger, made some
slight impression on same. It seemed
like a cylindrical substance about 1
inch in diameter with a hard, bone
like center or axis. Just before this
instance, Psyche's voice said, "I
feel bad here" and pushed my hand
up to the point on this cylindrical
substance.

Psyche presses my hand against "it"

My hand was on the table holding the

fell in the palm of my hand, feeling
like a rigid rod covered with soft
leather. It was placed between my
thumb and finger which were holding
the doughnut. I squeezed it very
hard, which produced no ill effect.
The rod then slipped through the
doughnut and raised it in the air.
Psyche reached over and pulled my
left hand over and placed it upon the
teleplasmic structure.
Released control of Psyche's right hand
though the bracelet is now visible
and has been visible throughout. I
now resume control of Psyche's right
hand. During the interval in which
I did not hold her hand, Dr. Wood
did have her hand.
Psyche has taken my right hand and
laid it firmly on the "teleplasm."
The "teleplasm" is now removed.
In this case it was on her hand.

While speaking, felt a touch of
"teleplasm" on my little finger. The
"teleplasm" apparently against
Psyche's right leg, above the knee.
Dr.Dunlop 11.02 Back of my hand touched by "it"
again. It is now touching my

Dr.Dunlap 11.04 My hand was put over and between
my fingers I felt of "it." It is cold,
soft, with rigid ruler-like core. I
cannot say whether it is a single or
multiple core.
Dr. McComas 11.05 Received rather sharp touch on left
hand which is resting on the table, I
should judge, about a foot from her
body, just the other side of Psyche's
two ankles.
Dr. Dunlap 11.07 The teleplasmic rod picked doughnut
out of my hand, held it several
inches above the table, moving it
around. In levitation now.

Dr. Dunlap 11.12 While levitating, teleplasmic rod struck
my fingers. A moment ago, rod
touched my fingers again.
Dr. McComas 11.14 Doughnut has dropped to the floor.
Several minutes levitation of

Apparently it is very firm with a
slightly ruffled effect.
Dr. Dunlap 11.16 I have the rod in my hand. Psyche

Dr. McComas 11.21 During the time that the teleplasmic
rod was striking at Dr. Dunlap's
head, Psyche's ankles were in my lap.
One of them passed out at one time
but came immediately back, then
both of them were out and came
back immediately. Psyche's body
was twisting and turning constantly.
Psyche turned around in her chair
and was apparently over on her right
thigh at the time of the strokes
upon Dr. Dunlap's head.

Dr. McComas 11.32 Just before Psyche came out of the

placed it on her stomach just below
the umbilical region and it remained
there for possibly ten seconds.
Dr. Dunlap 11 .33 We have broken our control.
The stenographer (Miss Barbaro) reported that she examined
and found the psychic unwell before the sitting and found her
still unwell after the sitting.
There was nausea and vomiting of the psychic after the
sitting.
Sitting closed at 11.33 p.m.
■
Several interesting incidents occurred which do not
appear in the notes. After the sitting was over Mrs.
Crandon was sitting in the open cabinet and the lights
were turned on. Some one suggested that the record
should be made trustworthy by having a thorough
examination of Mrs. Crandon and the cabinet at once.
Here occurred the cleverest repartee any medium
ever made. Mrs. Crandon coughed, gagged, leaned
over as though suffering from violent tnal de mer.

bathroom and we could hear a very good imitation
of a passenger crossing the English Channel. Dr.
Crandon left the room to see his wife. We took a
flashlight and examined the floor as we felt that
Psyche had been firing blank cartridges. She had.
Since we had been told that we had the freedom of
the house Dr. Dunlap and I returned to 10 Lime
Street the next day. Being told that the Crandons
were out we proceeded to the seance room to look
things over carefully. We had not been there long
before Mrs. Crandon entered and our Sherlock
Holmes work abruptly ceased. Mrs. Crandon seemed
to be in the pink of health, laughing and talking in
good spirits.
I mention this because Dr. Crandon insisted that
Dr. Wood's rough handling of the teleplasm made
Margery sick for a number of days and caused con
siderable loss of weight. Indeed this incident was
used by Dr. Crandon to terminate any further inves
tigation by this Commission. Perhaps he also heard
Dr. Wood say to me after Mrs. Crandon's hasty re
treat, "Shall I expose her now?" Possibly he also
heard me say, "No, this is not the time." At all
events Dr. Crandon found reasons to rule out both
of my fellow Commissioners, though he retained a
friendly feeling toward me.
Later as the Special Research Officer of the Ameri
can Society for Psychical Research I tried to make up
another Commission but I could never succeed in
satisfying Dr. Crandon. I believe Mrs. Crandon had

the courage and the ingenuity to face another Com
mission. My reason for this comes from one of the
most amusing incidents that occurred at Number 10
Lime Street. I had been urging the doctor to have
another scientific study of the case. Suddenly Marg
ery said, "Let's go ask Walter." Up into the familiar
dark room we went. Margery sat in her open cabi
net, the doctor beside her. Quickly Walter jumped
into the discussion. He was all for any kind of an
investigation anybody wanted. Dr. Crandon ob
jected to everything, but Margery's brother beat him
at every point. While I listened to the dialogue oc
casionally putting in a little argument for my next
Commission, I could not help thinking that here was
a unique way for a wife to manage her husband. It
was simple and effective. So I thought at the time.
However, I never got my Commission and after
months of fruitless effort I finally sent the following
report signed by the entire Commission to the So
ciety:

the delay in the appearance of a report to spread the impression
that the Commission as a whole has not found unfavorably for
the Margery mediumship, and also it has now become evident
that Dr. Crandon will not permit any member of the Com
mission to carry on an investigation of a genuinely scientific
character.
Your Commissioners had several sittings with Dr. and Mrs.
Crandon in the last week of January, 1926, which were reported
stenographically at the time of the sittings. These reports
were sent you immediately after the sittings and it is unneces
sary at this time, therefore, to discuss the sittings in detail.
The purpose of the present report is to give you the conclusions
of your Commissioners based on the observations of these
sittings, the reports of others, and some experiments of our own.
The sittings which were allotted to your Commissioners were
for observational purposes only, and no controls devised by us
were imposed upon Mrs. Crandon and no experiments were
planned and consummated in the seance room. It was our
intention to observe the effects Dr. and Mrs. Crandon produced
and to make our experiments later.
At the first sitting there were many of the friends of the
Crandons present to whom we were introduced. Some of
them constituted what Dr. Crandon termed his Advanced
Circle. It was intended by the Crandons to be an evening in
which the usual effects should be presented for our observation.
There was one effect, however, which they told us was a nov
elty. This consisted in rendering luminous paint, which had
lost its fluorescence in the dark, luminescent. A disc with
a hollow centre had been painted with luminous paint and had
become dark. We were told that "Walter's" terminal would
cause the "doughnut" to glow. When the doughnut became
luminescent the friends of the Crandons exclaimed with pleas
ure and congratulated "Walter" upon his achievement.
Dr. Wood reproduced this effect in his laboratory at the

Johns Hopkins University, using a pocket flashlight and an
ultra-violet filter. This phenomenon is a baffling one to people
who are unacquainted with the action of luminous paint in the
presence of very short light waves. Dr. Crandon had ample
opportunity to employ a pocket flash light in this way, and
actually had a flashlight in his pocket on the side towards the
medium at the sitting.
The bell-box was featured in these sittings as an especially
remarkable phenomenon. Dr. Dunlap noted the change in the
tension of the steel spring during a sitting. He constructed a
box in which the spring was enclosed in the body of the box, and
could be adjusted for various tensions. This arrangement pre
cluded any tampering with the spring. Dr. Dunlap was never
permitted to substitute his box for the one the Crandons had
been using. In two boxes made after the pattern of the
Crandon box the same effects that the Crandons obtained were
obtained by taking the tension from the spring during the
sitting and they prevented short-circuiting the connecting
wires, which are outside the box in the Crandon arrangement,
and which can readily be short-circuited by using a needle,
thus causing the bell to ring.
Your Commissioners were informed by Dr. Crandon that
psychic rods protruded from the body of the medium. He
stated that they were very sensitive and could perceive the
pips on playing cards and could identify various small objects
and wooden letters in complete darkness. At the last sitting
one member of the Commission squeezed the end of such an
alleged rod and neither Margery nor "Walter" were aware of the
fact until it was dictated for the stenographer.
Dr. Crandon had stated that the extreme sensitivity of
these "psychic rods" showed how intimately they were con
nected with the vitality of the medium. He argued that any
vigorous handling of such rods might injure the medium.
After the incident above described the sitting continued for

forty minutes with the rod in vigorous activity. After the
sitting one of your Commissioners suggested that Mrs. Crandon
remain in the cabinet until the light was turned on and that a
search then be made. When Mrs. Crandon heard this she
began to gag and cough as though ill. She bent forward as
though vomiting and hurried from the room. An examination
showed nothing upon the floor and the stomachic performance
seemed simulated.
In the opinion of Dr. Dunlap the "psychic rod" employed
on this occasion, as judged by feeling and by usual observation
in the dim light, was the intestine of some animal, showing the
stumps of some blood vessels and stuffed with some substance
like cotton, through which ran several wires.
The next day Dr. Dunlap and Dr. McComas visited the
Crandon house and did not find Mrs. Crandon any the worse
for her experience; she ran up and down the stairs easily and
seemed in excellent spirits. These details are mentioned be
cause Dr. Crandon has maintained that his wife was made ill
from the squeezing of the so-called "teleplastic rod."
From the time of this incident it was impossible to have fur
ther sittings as a Commission. We had provided in our Con
vention to have any disagreements adjusted by a committee
of three. Dr. Crandon would not have recourse to this agree
ment. He continually refused to have further sittings but
would not give his reasons to the Commission.
In the summer of 1926 your Society engaged Dr. McComas
as a Special Research Officer. He attended a number of sit
tings with Mrs. Crandon but was not permitted to try any tests
with the medium. He succeeded on one occasion in greatly
improving the controls for Mrs. Crandon but was not per
mitted to continue and to impose controls upon Dr. Crandon
and his associates. After several months of effort to experi
ment he abandoned that method of investigation as impossible
while Dr. Crandon had control of the situation. He then

sought to duplicate the "Margery phenomena." Professor
Grant H. Code, of the University of Delaware, reproduced the
levitation effects excellently; he also reproduced the bell-box
effect and the reading of the cards in the dark.
Dr. McComas held two seances in his office at the Society's
building, using a Hindoo for the "medium." These meetings
were attended by members of the Society who had had wide
experience in psychic research. Some fifteen of these sitters
voluntarily signed statements to the effect that these phe
nomena were done by no normal means known to them. Five
of the sitters had seen the Margery phenomena and agreed that
these were quite as good as Margery's. These phenomena con
sisted in the ringing of the bell-box, whistling and whispering
by the medium using a voice cut-out of the Richardson type,
reading cards in the dark and the appearance of psychic lights.
These effects and those obtained by Professor Code are
excellent duplicates of the Crandon performances.
In view of the above findings your Commission submits
that the Margery mediumship is a clever and entertaining per
formance but is unworthy of any serious consideration by your
Society.
We submit further that the unwillingness of Dr. Crandon
to allow the Commission to proceed with the investigation is
a sufficient indication that no investigation by competent
investigators employing the methods and checks required in
all scientific research is likely to be permitted.
For some reason the American Society for Psychi
cal Research did not feel inclined to publish this re
port. It was treated the way Dr. Rhine's report
was treated when he submitted his findings that
indicated the Crandons were playing tricks.
And now we must admit that all the scientific at
tempts to study Margery came to no conclusions as

to just how her feats were performed. The reason
was, of course, that the investigations were stopped
whenever they found a good lead. In my own case
I had urged that a stethoscope be placed on the me
dium's throat which would have told instantly
whether a whisper came from that source. Of course
this was denied me. Then I urged that I might run
Margery and Walter through an association test.
This would very clearly have proved any identity of
the two. That was denied me, as the doctor said
it savored of psycho-analysis. Then I wanted to
cross examine Walter about some of his doings in
this vale of tears. I had learned from an intimate
friend a great deal about the young man, and some
shocking episodes that he could not forget if he had
lived to be a hundred. I never had a chance.
With some amusement and sympathy I watched
the development of this famous Boston case. It ap
peared that the thumb-print of Walter had been
found on an old razor blade. It was a curious print
with a strongly marked scar in it. There would not
be one chance in many millions of another thumb
carrying those lines and that scar. Imagine the
amazement and delight of Margery's admirers when
Walter decided to materialize his thumb and give
them fresh duplicates of the old print. Duplicates
in plenty he gave them. And now the terrible anti
climax. The faithful and long suffering Mr. E. E.
Dudley discovered that it was the thumb-print of a
Boston dentist!

CHAPTER IX
MY OWN SEANCE
For
nearly a year I had been trying to come to
grips with Dr. Crandon. Never could I quite
reach him. Always I was held off. It made me feel
the way I used to when I was a small boy and wanted
to wrestle with a tall boy. Every time I would reach
his shoulder, or swing my arms hoping to catch his
knees, that long arm would hold me off so that I could
never accomplish a grip. So there seemed to me only
one thing to do and that was to reproduce the Marg
ery phenomena. If this were done it would at least
be one answer to the Society's inquiry, "Is Margery
genuine?" Though it would not explain how Marg
ery did her feats, it would at least be a challenge to
Lime Street and would argue that the good doctor
should be more amenable to real tests. Indeed, I
invited the doctor to come to my seance some time
and see if he could explain my "phenomena."
Little did I imagine what I was getting into when
I planned a seance of my own. Positively it is one
of the most exciting experiences any one can have.
I have fished in many waters and have shot different
sorts of game but I have never known a thrill to
match that of saving your medium from an exposure

just in the nick of time. Indeed, there is not a dull
moment during the whole evening when you are con
ducting a seance. Effects must be had and you must
lead up to them. Constantly on the defensive you
cannot let anything suspicious bob up during the
evening. Dull moments there may be for the sitters
but there is never a dull moment for the medium or
the master of ceremonies.
To duplicate Dr. Crandon's seance it was necessary
to get "atmosphere," not a little but a lot, for I was
extending invitations to connoisseurs. More than
that, I was going to have some sitters who had been
to see Margery and it was necessary to give as con
vincing an exhibition as she did. Consequently, I
was puzzled about my atmosphere. I found
it,
how
ever, in
a
most unexpected way.
In New York there
is
a
very wise, little man who
sells apparatus for magicians. He does not show you
all his wares the first few times you visit his unpre
tentious shop. After you have proven that you are
one of the elect you may get into his back room. As
I
was much interested in building an apparition and
had already done some experimenting with luminous
paint, anthracine and the ultra-violet ray,
I
gained
access to the sanctum. There, as
I
explained what
sort of cloth
I
needed and how the paint was to be
applied,
I
excited the curiosity of another customer,
a
Hindoo. He, too, was in the apparition business.
We compared notes. He claimed his apparition was

the best that had been produced. To prove it he
cited a seance he had held for a half a dozen physi
cians, a short time before. According to his account
every one of his sitters were convinced that they had
seen something supernatural. No wonder! This is
what he did. Seated in a large arm chair he dropped
into a deep trance. Then on the wall behind him,
in the darkened room, a face glowed suddenly in clear
vision of all the men. Turning on the light and rush
ing to the wall they could find nothing to account for
the strange appearance. Then I knew I had found
my atmosphere, —this Hindoo.
The next important accomplishment was to du
plicate Dr. Crandon's clever arrangement for prevent
ing sitters' changing their minds. During a sitting
and immediately afterwards a sitter is often puz
zled. Maybe for the moment he is quite convinced
that he has witnessed something supernormal. That
is the time to get him to commit himself. Then he
cannot say, the next morning, that he knew it was a
farce all along. To accomplish this I had my sitters
sign the following memorandum if they cared to do
so. "On the evening of January the twenty-seventh,
Ran Chandra had a sitting at the American Society
for Psychical Research, in which four of the phe
nomena of the Margery mediumship were reproduced.
Cards were identified in the dark. A bell-box was
rung, as Margery rings hers. A voice cut-out was
used, similar to that of Dr. Richardson's, and psychic

lights were obtained. The observers signed a state
ment to the effect that: 'These phenomena were
observed by me and I further state that they were
done by no normal means known to me.'
" Fifteen
of the sitters signed this memorandum and several
of these had seen the Margery seances.
Of course it was not practicable to reproduce all
the things that Margery had done. That would have
taken too long and would have required considerable
rehearsing. So I selected some of the things which
were most frequently done in the famous little room
at Number Ten Lime Street.
After a little rehearsing I felt that my Hindoo was
prepared to do his part. I did not give him any op
portunities to vary the program. Indeed I needed
him only for atmosphere. Any one could have fitted
into his role with a little training. But as a producer
of atmosphere he was magnificent. I introduced
him, after allowing the sitters to examine the room,
and called attention to the fact that the Hindoos had
been interested in occultism long before our civiliza
tion was started. What Margery did, I maintained,
were but kindergarten performances for the Hindoo.
Then to give the situation a Crandon touch I urged
them to be their own observers and draw their own
conclusions. I went further. I stated that I was in
no position to endorse the genuineness of what he did
and that I had always believed that all such phe
nomena should be carefully observed before coming

to any conclusions. This may seem as though a cool
blanket was thrown over the proceedings at the out
set. If that were the case what followed quickly
counteracted such an effect. The Hindoo rose, an
impressive figure. From head to foot streamed a
long white robe, and above his cleancut, Oriental face
was a resplendent gold turban. In a voice that no
one could resist he urged them to bear with him as
he led in a prayer to his own Invisible Spirit in the
ancient Sanskrit language. Even I felt moved.
And I knew that his only acquaintance with Sanskrit
was the alphabet which he had been repeating.
In front of the Hindoo was a little wooden table
around which we were all seated. My place was next
to the Hindoo, just as Dr. Crandon usually sat next
to Margery. The sitters were given a pack of cards
in the dark from which they could select any card
they wished. It was so very dark that no one could
see the pips on the face of the cards. After they had
slipped one out of the pack they would place it on
the table, and in a few moments the Hindoo would
tell them what was the number and the suit of the
card. Then each sitter would retake his card and,
remembering how it had been named, would wait
until the light was turned on to verify it. In only a
few cases were there any errors. Usually these oc
curred with face cards. Indeed, it was a very con
vincing performance; the room was so dark and the
replies were so prompt that it seemed impossible for

anyone to read the cards. The explanation current
around the table was that it must be done by means of
ectoplasm or teleplasm, which could feel the pips on
the cards.
Behind the scenes this is what went on. Just be
hind my chair lay my hat and coat. I reached back,
caught up the hat and handed it to the Hindoo. In
side the hat was a little luminous paint. All that this
modern exponent of the ancient mysteries had to do
was to hold the hat before him, reach out and pick
up a card, hold it near the luminous paint, read it
and slip it back on the table. Simple? Not so very.
Let that luminous paint stand for twenty minutes and
it does not throw enough glow to read anything. So
that experiment has to be done shortly after the
seance starts or you are lost. On the other hand if
you get too much luminous paint it will reflect on
the white robe and then there is nothing to do but go
home.
The next entry was my chef d'oeuvre. On the table
rested a simple bell-box, built on the Crandon pat
tern. It was a small box which contained two dry-
cell batteries and a little bell. Exactly the sort of
thing that everyone has in his house to ring the door
bell. Instead of a push button to ring the bell I had
a broad, wooden flap on top of the box lid. When it
was pressed down from an angle of about forty-five
degrees, at which it was held by a spring, it would
bring two pieces of copper together and ring the bell.

All of the wiring could be traced very easily and any
one could see the whole apparatus in all of its sim
plicity. Everyone was invited to inspect the box and
to satisfy himself that there were no trick gadgets in
it. Then when the light was turned out and all had
joined hands around the table so that no one could
reach out and press the flap to ring the bell the spirit
of the Hindoo would be called upon to press down
that flap and ring the bell as a sitter might wish.
This worked very nicely. A sitter would call for
two short rings and a long one or three long rings and
the box responded according to the request. This
was very impressive as all hands were joined and no
foot could reach the box.
Even more striking was the performance of the
box when a faint light was allowed in the room.
Then it behaved as did Crandon's box. A sitter was
allowed to pick it up, hold it in his hands, swing it
around in a circle and satisfy himself that there were
no threads or wires controlling it. The box began to
ring the moment it was taken from the table and kept
on ringing continuously or intermittently while it was
being held. It ceased the moment it was placed back
upon the table. Each sitter was told that this was
what would happen and when it did happen it made a
strong impression. Then in a good strong light the
box was examined and no evidence of trickery could
be found. Indeed, I shall never forget the expression

fully raised the box and discovered that it rang ac
cording to specifications and also that it stopped as
had been predicted. I was anxious to see if he would
sign the memorandum. He did. That box was con
vincing.
Again let us go behind the scenes. The medium
had nothing to do with the ringing of the box. While
we tried to work up "power" by singing "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic" I slipped out of my seat and
caught a thread around the spring that held up the
flap. The other end I held in my mouth. That
enabled anyone to hold my hands and those of the
medium and did not interfere with the flapping of
the flap. All I had to do was to throw my head back
to produce a signal. Then when that part of the
performance was over I would start chewing on the
thread until I had pulled it off the spring and worked
its entire length into my mouth.
Ringing the bell by lifting the box from the table
was not so simple a procedure. That box was tricky.
It had a very heavy bottom which was not fastened
very tightly. When it was lifted the bottom would
sag down a fraction of an inch. As the wires were
attached to this bottom and ran from there to the
flap, when the bottom went down the flap went too
and the little bell rang. To prevent this from hap
pening when people were inspecting the box I would
straighten the spring and lift the flap so high that
the slight pull of the bottom could not bring the cop

per contacts together. After the signals had been
given it was my nice job to slip out of the chair as
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" was being sung
again and press the spring down to a place where
the pull of the bottom would bring the contacts to
gether. That is where I got some thrills. This sort
of thing has to be done while there is some noise
going on. Consequently there must be a pause in the
proceedings as though the power had disappeared.
To get it back there must be some loud singing and
under the cover of that one can make some unob
served noises of his own. On one occasion I was
groping around the box and my fingers interlaced
with a hand coming from the other side of the table.
Now there is only one thing to do in such a predica
ment and that is nothing. Fortunately the sitter
who was doing this investigating said nothing. After
the seance was over I engaged him in conversation.
I told him that I was doing a little investigating and
had reached out to explore the box. I asked him if
it was his hand with which I had come in contact.
Imagine my surprise when he exclaimed:
"Good heavens ! Was that your hand? I thought
it was a piece of ectoplasm."
That young man was a graduate from a famous
university!
I should have mentioned that we had constructed
a sort of cabinet within which the medium could sit.

some cloths thrown over them and so arranged that
the medium's hands could be lashed tightly to the
sides of the cabinet. Of course we had quite a little
ceremony in trussing up the Hindoo hand and foot.
The fastenings had to be examined so that everyone
was satisfied that he could not get a hand or foot
free. Then it was explained to the group that the
Hindoo had a spirit which controlled him. As Margery
had her "Walter" so Ran Chandra had his "Gogol."
With Margery, Walter chatted alongside her head.
The Hindoo was more canny; he left you to guess
where his Gogol was. Of course it was necessary to
use a whisper, for they are hard to identify. The
voice of a little girl and that of an old man are easily
distinguished; but each, with a little practice, can
develop whispers that no one can distinguish. Gogol
whispered. You could hear him deep in the cabinet
and all you needed to complete the mystery was the
recollection of the "voice cut-out."
This voice cut-out was my own invention. It was
built on the same pattern as that of Dr. Richardson.
A large U-tube stood in a rack on the table in front
of the cabinet. From one arm of the tube a heavy
rubber tubing ran to the medium's mouth. Instead
of Dr. Richardson's nipple I used a simple glass fun
nel. When this was slipped into the mouth and held
between the gums and the lips, with the tongue in
serted in the funnel's opening not a word could be
articulated. To prove that the tongue was inserted

in the funnel it was necessary to blow in the tube,
thus changing the level of the water in the U-tube.
As long as the tongue was inserted the water could
be held at a low level in one arm of the U-tube and
at a high level in the other. While this was done no
one's mouth could be used for any other purpose.
Eash sitter was allowed to satisfy himself that this
was true.
After the Hindoo had been properly secured in the
cabinet so that he could not use his hands or feet,
the funnel was inserted into his mouth. Then the
lights were turned out. Everyone waited with
breathless expectancy. Nothing happened. To help
the flagging power "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"
was sung once more. After its stirring strains had
faded a whisper could be heard coming from the
cabinet. Light though it was it carried some heavy
philosophy. It did not stoop to trivial things. It
did not bring sketchy and ambiguous messages from
the dead. Rather it reflected the deep learning of
ancient India. It was impressive.
It seemed to me that this feat was more convincing
to the sitters than anything else we did. I felt that
it was mystifying and convincing because I had puz
zled for some weeks over this very performance with
Margery. There really was no way the Hindoo could
get his hands free to get the tube out of his mouth.
No confederate was needed for this performance and

me speaking from where I sat. Indeed, I believe a
good magician would be badly puzzled to explain this
phenomenon.
Behind the scenes this is what went on. In that
long, heavy rubber tube were two little valve seats
and a small steel ball rolled between them. When
the breath was blown into the tube and the tube was
either raised or lowered the little ball would roll into
one or the other of the valve seats. Once firmly
lodged in a seat it would stop the movement of air.
All that was necessary to hold the water at any level
desired was to blow in the tube, lower it and allow
the little ball to close the valve. Then the mouth
could be freed from the funnel and messages given at
will. To hold the tube snugly without the use of the
hand, it was only necessary to grasp it between the
knees. It was sufficiently rigid to remain in an up
right position while the funnel was slipped from the
mouth.
One night something went wrong with one of the
valves. Wait as we would and sing as we did, Gogol
would not whisper. Everyone became impatient.
I knew that something had gone wrong but I could
not imagine what. In such a predicament there is
only one thing to do; get more power. So they sang
and I investigated. That valve would not work.
I had to crouch down beside the cabinet, take the

with luminous paint change their positions. There
I remained until the Gogol had told about this life
and the life to come. It seemed an eternity to me.
What could I do if someone addressed a remark to
"the doctor?" Nor was that the worst of it. I had
to find my way back to the chair in the dark after
the messages had ceased.
There was one thing that I was very anxious to
achieve at these sittings. I wanted to go Margery
one better and have a good apparition appear in view
of everyone. On one side of the room I had hung a
large sheet. Upon this the wise, little man who sold
magician apparatus had painted a human face in
anthracine. To make this glow in the dark it is
necessary to throw an ultra-violet ray upon it. These
rays cannot be seen as they stream across a dark
room. In my pocket I had a strong flashlight with
an ultra-violet filter. My puzzle was to get the filter
adjusted to the flash and then make the beams hit
the right place on the sheet. In the rehearsal every
thing went nicely. From the sheet a face glowed
clearly the moment the rays struck the paint. With
a little practice I could make the face flash out and
disappear so quickly that it was impossible to do
more than get the impression of a human face. Ex
posures of about one second gave the best effect.
Longer exposures betrayed the fact that the face was
painted.

chances. That rules me out of their class. I took
a chance by putting a fresh battery in my flashlight
at the first sitting. It made the light so strong that
I had to give up my effort. Try as I would I could
not adjust that light. On the second occasion I did
succeed in having the face show on the wall for an
instant. Unfortunately only a few of the sitters
observed it. To them it was very impressive. Cu
rious things can happen in a seance. Once I left the
filter off by mistake and snapped my flashlight in
the direction of the sheet. For an instant the sheet
flashed white. All that side of the room was illumi
nated. I was sure that I had ruined everything and
that my seance was completely spoiled. Surprisingly
enough, few people noticed it. Those that did were
delighted. Never had they seen such a spread of
psychic light before.
Surely luck was with me that evening, some good
and some bad. Bad luck followed that flashlight
and the filter. At a critical moment, as I tried to
slip the filter over the flashlight it slipped from my
fingers and fell to the floor. I could not find it any
where and I did not dare to explore too far. It
would have been bad technique to bump my head
against some sitter's knees. While I was gingerly
groping about on the floor losing my good disposition
at a rapid rate one of the lady sitters who prided
herself on her acumen remarked:
"Dr. McComas, did you hear something rap?"

MY OWN STANCE 161
Dr. McComas had to seat himself on a chair to
make his voice come from a natural position and
then assume a casual tone,—"Why, what did it
sound like?"
"It sounded like a spirit rap but too metallic. I
never heard a spirit rap sound metallic. Do you sup
pose it was a spirit rap?"
I was not in a position to defend a spirit rap at that
moment, so I took my watch chain and hit it on the
side of the table and asked her if that was the sound
she heard, telling her that it was my watch chain
against the table.
"Oh, that was it," she exclaimed, relieved, "I
could not imagine how a spirit rap could have sounded
so metallic. All that I have heard had dull sound."
Now was that good luck.
You may infer from this last episode that I had
some very good sitters in my circle, and indeed I did.
They not only helped my own performances along,
but two of them staged a performance of their own.
Out of the floor in the midst of the circle two ladies
saw a luminous form arise. Each assisted the other
in describing
it,
the faintness of the light, its curious
movements, its growing dimensions. Since this was

attribute it to imagination. It did not seem that I
could afford to have anything happen which would
cheapen the seance. So I decided to divert their at
tention. Now it never would do to deliberately call
two seers away from their vision. That would lay
one open to all sorts of criticism. It occurred to me
that if they put their minds on anything else the
apparition would evaporate Therefore I suggested
that we try to get a little more power in order to see
what might develop and asked that we sing "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic." To a man who comes
from the South that tune is not an especial favorite.
When he has heard it a thousand times in a dark room
it is apt to jangle his nerves. On this occasion I
enjoyed
it,
for
it
chased away the apparition and
saved my seance.
In numerous seances sitters speak of feeling psychic
breezes. Cool air blows against the cheeks, hands
or ankles. At my seance
I
had made no arrange
ments to produce these effects. Nevertheless
a
num
ber of people declared that they felt them. This
is
a
good illustration of what can happen when you have
the right atmosphere at
a
sitting.
Throughout the whole of the evening
I
had been
dreading the moment when the lights should go on
and
I
should ask my sitters
if
they would sign the

MY OWN STANCE 163
I could not tell what critical attitude might be build
ing up in the minds of some of those present. After
a seance is over and people begin to compare notes
the very good impression that the seance gave as a
whole can readily be dispelled by the remarks of
someone who knows just how to explain everything.
Happily no such condition arose. Over half of my
sitters willingly signed the paper. The others were
not critical or hostile but simply did not wish to com
mit themselves.
Shortly after the seance I wrote to the people who
had participated and told them that the Hindoo and
I had worked up these effects in order to show Dr.
Crandon that what Margery did could be done by
natural means and that Dr. Crandon should permit
an investigation much more thorough-going than
any that he had allowed up to date. Some of my
sitters took it all in good part, others were somewhat
indignant.

CHAPTER X
REPORTED AND REPUTED
One
of the things that first impressed me in read
ing the proceedings of The British Society for
Psychical Research was the apparent correctness of a
number of messages given by mediums. As the
person who received the message commented upon
what "came through" it was indeed surprising to find
so many things that were pertinent to the investi
gator's life. In fact, it remained a mystery to me
until I, myself, began to report upon what a medium
gave me and then the experience showed up the sub
ject in an entirely new light.
As you read the first account of my sitting with
Mrs. Sanders I think you will notice its similarity to
many of the accounts that appear in the magazines
published by Psychic Research Societies. Indeed,
when I returned to the Society and read my notes
with their comments to the young lady then acting
as secretary she exclaimed that it was the most
"veridical and evidential" material that she had
seen during her connection with the Society.
Sitting with Mrs. Sanders, July 27, 1926.
Medium: I get the initial J. Also an L, a woman's name.
She passed out three months ago.

REPORTED AND REPUTED 165
(Note: The pronouncing of the J and L suggested to me the
name of a friend, Gillet, who had died about nine months
previously. However the medium did not get the final syllable
of the name. My friend, however, was a man.)
Medium: The spirit of a gentleman is here. I see an old
house among the trees, part of it is falling down. The word
Illinois comes to me.
(Note: The word Illinois has no significance that I can dis
cover. I always associate an old colonial house with my friend
G, for there we spent some of the happiest days of my life.)
Medium: Also an H. A spirit of a lady, motherly, not dead
long. Abdominal trouble. She comes close to me. Her
name begins with Em or M. Is perhaps forty or forty-five.
Has dark hair, parted in the middle. Had three daughters.
One daughter's name begins with an M, the other with a P.
She asks how A or J are.
(Note: The H is the initial of my first name. The motherly
lady fits very closely my maternal grandmother. She was
very much older than forty-five at the time of her death,
but was very young in appearance. She wore a wig, with
rather dark hair, which was parted in the middle. Her name
was Mary. She had two daughters, one named Mary and
the other Phoebe. My grandmother was very fond of two
men who married two of her grand-daughters, a Jim and an
Albert.)
M: Two parts of the family lived together while this lady
was living.
(Note: My father and mother lived with my grandmother
and her daughter in my grandmother's country home during
the summer months.)
M: Is there a Jim?
Sitter: Yes, there is a Jim.
M: How is Jim? Sends her love to him. There has been
some trouble three months ago. Something was sold. Did
C have anything to do with it? I seem to get a C. Is it a C?

166 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
Sitter: No, it is an 0.
M: Yes, that is right. It is an O.
(Note: The Jim mentioned is the husband of her grand
daughter, of whom she was very fond. When mention was
made of something sold three months before I at once thought
of my brother who had sold it and suggested an 0 for a C as
the two letters are much alike in appearance.)
M: A man passed out near the old house. The name was
W. He was probably shot. I get a Robert, Robert B. Or
is it Robert C? Watkins, Wadley? No, it doesn't come quite
clear. He calls you Henry.
(Note: The following incident was suggested to me by the
reference to the old house: a Robinson C. Waters was nearly
shot by me in a boyish escapade near this old house. Of
course he is not the one who passed out, but while I was there
an elderly man was nearing death and died some time after I
left. "He calls you Henry"; this is the first time that the
medium mentioned my name, and she did so without the least
hesitation, as coming from the lips of a friend who had known
me since I was eleven years old.)
M: Are there five in the family?
Sitter: No, four.
M: Are you the last?
Sitter: No, third.
M: Don't they call you Doctor?
Sitter: Yes.
(Note: Though this came with no hesitation, it cannot be
taken as evidential, for I was referred to in a phone conversa
tion as "Doctor.")
M: There seems to be a woman who might also be called
Doctor. She is with you. She is very close to you. "Don't
know whether you are an M.D. or a D.D. Would her name be
M? Also her name sounds like Laura.
(Note: I have a cousin, a trained nurse, whose name is "Em."

REPORTED AND REPUTED 167
She lived for many years with her mother, Laura. We were
closely associated in the upbringing of another cousin. There
was a member of this family, a sister to Laura, who was often
called "Doc," playfully, and who passed on six months before.)
M: I find you three months ago having trouble. Something
has to be cancelled. She calls "Hebe." She has crimpy hair,
gray-blue eyes. Has very little hair.
(Note: The reference to the trouble three months ago has
been explained. The cancelling probably had to do with a
certain phase of the negotiations. "She calls 'Hebe.'
" The
medium did not get this very clear. If it were the grand
mother, the name could well have been Phoebe. "She has
crimpy hair, very little hair." This description of the hair
is quite apropos as the lady in question had very scanty hair
and wore a wig with a crimpy, wavy effect in it. The gray
blue eyes also fit the picture nicely.)
M: I am speaking of a young woman who is with her. She
died of a fever, due to an accident. Her name is S or B.
Weren't you near death in October or August?
Sitter: Yes, in October some years ago.
(Note: The young woman referred to may well be the grand
daughter of the older woman with the crimpy hair. Her name
did begin with B. I am not informed concerning her death.
I think there was an anaemia. I know of no accident that
preceded her death. My information, however, is lacking in
these details. Several years ago I nearly died from appendi
citis, the attack occurring late in October.)
M: You have a brother who is a doctor. No? Oh, it's a
close friend. His name begins with a T or an F. He has a
relation in the spirit land.
(Note: My brother was not a doctor, but many of my friends
in the academic world are called by the title "doctor." Of
these there are not a few whose name begins with a T or an F.
I do not think, however, of any close friend with these initials.)

168 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
M: Bob says tell you Jeff is with him.
Sitter laughs.
M: Do you recognize Jeff?
Sitter: I wonder. Isn't he a colored man?
M: Yes, that is it. He is a colored man.
Sitter: Did he die of drink?
M: Yes, that is Jeff.
(Note: At once when the names Bob and Jeff were mentioned
my thoughts went back to some amusing incidents involving
the old house in the country, the Robert that I associated with
it and a darkey who was always drinking "giant tonic." I
had not thought of him for years but the name Jeff seemed to
fit it. Later I recalled his right name.
M: An elderly lady is here. Her name begins with an R
or a B.
Sitter: The younger lady's name began with a B.
M: Yes that is so. It is the younger lady. She didn't
want to pass out. You have been doing something for her.
She thanks you and Jim.
(Note: An R and a B look much alike and the medium could
easily have confused them if her visual imagery were not very
clear. The B suggested a young woman in the prime of life
who did not want to pass out. The little service that I had
done her son did not occur to me to be worthy of thanks until
the moment of this sitting.)
M: Did you come to investigate spirits? I mean, to come
near to spirits, some five, six or seven years ago?
Sitter: I nearly died.
M: Yes, that is it.
(Note: Some seven years before this s6ance I nearly died
after an appendix operation. In coming out of the ether I
was much confused and the nurse appeared for the moment
like a wraith.)
M: Is the elderly lady your mother?
Sitter: No, she was not my mother.

REPORTED AND REPUTED 169
M: I put Henry in short pants Did you have a rela
tion who met with an accident which affected his neck? I
can feel him going down, down, down.
Sitter: I had an uncle who was drowned.
M: He is with us.
(Note: I have no recollection of my first entrance into short
pants, but I did have at that time an uncle who met with an
accident at sea and was drowned. I do not remember whether
he was injured before drowning.)
M: I get the name Bert. Does that mean anything to you?
Sitter: No.
M: Perhaps it is Albert.
Sitter: Yes, I know an Albert.
(Note: The elderly lady suggested was devoted to Albert.
I often associate them together in my mind.)
M: An old sweetheart of yours is here. Her name begins
with H.
Sitter: Could it be Helen?
M: Yes, that is it. She has put away the old things you gave
her. You must read "Lavender and Old Lace" and you will
understand.
(Note: I once knew a girl named Helen, though she was not
a sweetheart. Perhaps when I read the book mentioned I
will see some pertinent references. The young lady is asso
ciated with my first attendance at church.)
M: My guide says it seems as if you had been delayed in
doing things you wanted to do, but in September or October
you will enter into a new situation. You are going to get away
from old conditions. Doors will be opened. There will be
even a change in location. You have been released from old
conditions. You are being helped by the young woman who
recently passed out. One that is related to Jim. There is a
spirit who passed out while taking ether. Do you know a
Rodney or a Jacoby?
Sitter: No.

170 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
(Note: It is true that the following September found me in a
new location far away from old conditions and engaged in a
new occupation. I cannot recall a Rodney or Jacoby.)
M: Bessie is here. Sends love. Take care of yourself.
I have not gone far from you. I am taking all the chances
I can to pierce the veil. I will rap on the General; I mean his
picture.
(Note: The name Bessie came in very promptly without any
guessing whatever. It was the name of a cousin with whom
I grew up in boyhood. The reference to the General is not
clear. Occasionally I have been humorously called "General,"
though I did not believe that she knew of this.)
Sitter: We have no picture of a General, but sometimes I
have been called "General."
M: Yes, she knows you were called "General."
(Note: During her lifetime she did not meet the people who
called me General.)
M: She has a message for E. M. She says she has not for
gotten what M has done for her and what she has done for B.
M has brought up B. Says she knows what M is doing for B.
(Note: I have a cousin whom we call M. She has brought
up her brother's child, whose name begins with B, from her
early childhood to maturity.)
M: Name begins with P. I am also hearing an R and an A.
Would it be Prather? Something went to the bottom with
that name.
Sitter: That was the name of the uncle who was drowned,
or rather the name sounded like that.
After these remarks the medium indulged in a little
philosophy and some general statements about my
work, which, with some statements about my health
are not very interesting. The last statement she
made ran as follows :

REPORTED AND REPUTED 171
M: Guide says you are going to have many happy days in
the body because you have not yet finished life's work. You
are now going to begin to accomplish
it,
especially helped
by one who went on before, the young lady who was B. She
says "Little Boy Blue, you will understand."
(Note: There
is
no comment to make upon the Guide's
prediction about the future. The reference to Little Boy Blue
was quite
a
surprise. The morning before
I
went to the seance
I
dressed myself in
a
set of blue overalls and slipped on
a
blue
coat to match.
I
happened to see myself in
a
large mirror and
exclaimed, "Hello, Little Boy Blue with
a
bald head.")
In the foregoing report
I
have attempted to enter
into the spirit of the situation very sympathetically.
Everything the medium said
I
sought to find reflected
in some experience during my life. Occasionally
it
called for some ingenuity to make connections.
However
it
is
quite evident that anyone who
is
thor
oughly convinced that the message "coming through"
has
a
bearing on his life and comes from someone
who really knows his past will naturally find inter
pretations and explanations. In doing this his per
sonal equation can work into his material so smoothly
and easily that he
is
not even aware of the ingenuity
he
is
putting forth to make sense out of the message.
Now let us turn to the same notes taken during
the seance but studied in an entirely different mood.
Instead of trying to find some meaning, obvious or
hidden, in what was said, the attitude
is
to read what
the message presented, think
it
over carefully and
state frankly whether
it
has any application to the
sitter's own life.

172 GHOSTS I HAVE TALKED WITH
Silting with Mrs. Sanders, July 27, 1926.
Mrs. Sanders seated herself in a large, comfortable chair and
wrapped herself in several shawls. She placed a foot-stool
with a cushion upon it at her feet, and covered her knees and
feet with a large shawl. After a general conversation she
placed a thick, blue bandage around her eyes and began to
speak in the rdle of a medium.
M: I get the initial J. Also an L, a woman's name. She
passed out three months ago.
(Note: No such woman known to me.)
It: The spirit of a gentleman is here. I see an old house
among the trees, part of it is falling down. The word Illinois
comes to me.
(Note: Am absolutely unacquainted with any houses in
Illinois.)
M: Also an H. A spirit of a lady, motherly, not dead long.
Abdominal trouble. She comes close to me. Her name
begins with Em or M. Is perhaps forty or forty-five. Has
dark hair, parted in the middle. Had three daughters. One
daughter's name begins with M, the other one with P. She
asks how A or J are.
(Note: I am unable to remember anyone who would fit in
with the above description.)
M: Two parts of the family lived together while this lady
was living.
(Note: Not being able to identify the woman, cannot say
anything of her family.)
M: Is there a Jim?
Sitter: Yes, there is a Jim.
M: How is Jim? Sends her love to him. There has been

(Note: A piece of property was sold about three months ago
by a member of my family whose name began with an 0.
I suggested O. There was no "trouble." Simply a delay in
making the sale.)
M: A man passed out near the old house. The name was W.
He was probably shot. I get a Robert, Robert B. Or is it
Robert C? Watkins, Wadley? No, it doesn't come quite
clear. He calls you Henry.
(Note: The name Henry is correct, but I know of no one
named Robert who was shot and killed. Also my boyhood
friends never called me "Henry."
M: Are there five in the family?
Sitter: No, four.
M: Are you the last?

promptly substituted a friend and then made the broad state
ment that he had a relation in the spirit land. I have no
close friend whose name begins with a T or an F and who is
also a doctor.)
M: Bob says tell you Jeff is with him.

had no significance.)

some broad general statements about life and advice

Her last statement was :

are now going to begin to accomplish
it,
especially helped by
one who went on before, the young lady who was B. She says,

(Note: The one thing in this statement which could have been
significant was the association of the young lady
B
and Little
Boy Blue. If the lady had ever called my attention to Little
Boy Blue either in pictures or poetry there might have been
a
significance. As
a
matter of fact the lady was not young when
she died, she was about forty-five years of age and
I
had seen
little or nothing of her for some twenty-five years.)

is

very marked difference between

CHAPTER XI
WHY WE ARE SUPERSTITIOUS
New
York's famous sky-line expresses more than
the wealth and genius of a young nation. It
is the expression of a great body of knowledge. Each
of those towering buildings is made possible by mod
ern science. Years of inconspicuous labor in hun
dreds of laboratories by a great number of men
evolved the ideas that are built into those structures.
A fairly good measure of the knowledge of a people
is to be found in the things they build. Between a
canoe moored by a Brazilian Indian village and the
Mauretania in New York lie centuries of acquired
information.
In gradually building up the mass of knowledge
that comprises science, the hardest and slowest part
was in the beginnings. Once the right methods were
found and some instruments devised to help in mak
ing observations it would seem that the sciences grew
with astonishing rapidity. Most of the inertia in
getting started lay in the peculiar difficulty of form
ing new habits in thinking. For the sort of knowl
edge that constitutes the civilized man's equipment
calls for an attitude that seems most unnatural to
simpler people. Indeed, the very common ideas of

mathematical accuracy, careful observations, critical
deductions are simply not known among the primitive
people and it calls for long and exacting training for
them to take up the scientists' method of acquiring
knowledge.
Indeed, the way of getting information as well as
the character of the information is so different be
tween the men "in a state of nature" and the men
who live in our artificial civilization that it is quite
worth our while to note these differences. Especially
is this worthy of attention, because a very great num
ber of our citizens are not trained scientists and they
mix primitive thinking with their modern thinking.
One of the chief sources of knowledge among prim
itive people is authority. A few old men or women
have the knowledge which has come down to them
from the years. Their statements carry great weight.
If they have the intelligence to give some valuable
decisions, their prestige becomes enormous. Knowl
edge gained in this way is very congenial to the aver
age human being. He learns to accept his elders'
ideas in his childhood and the habit of taking ready
made conceptions is hard to abandon later. All
through the Middle Ages the thinking world preferred
to take Aristotle's statements rather than to experi
ment and learn for themselves. Today a very large
percent of our people accept opinions from any well-
advertised source. Often an argument is settled
and an opponent squashed by an apt quotation from

some well-known man. A great many people believe
in spiritualism because of Oliver Lodge and Conan
Doyle. An "authority" is a lazy or ignorant man's
best friend.
Another trait that characterizes both primitive
men and children is the mixing of emotion into the
thinking that supplies their information. An un
friendly tribe is hated, therefore they are known as
inferiors or monsters. Dangerous animals are known
to have mystic powers. Children know queer things
about dark cellars and thunder storms at night. We
have just passed through an acrimonious era. Pro
hibition advocates have painted pictures of their
opponents that were based on a hatred of excessive
drinking. Their antagonists developed a propaganda
conveying the idea that all prohibitionists were joy
less, overbearing, and victims of one idea. These
are rather obvious examples of emotional thinking.
As a matter of fact, very little thinking is free from
some form of emotion. Among thinking people who
are careful of their product there is always a caution
against allowing the emotions to enter. Two men
translating the same Latin author have produced
strikingly different results according to their feelings
concerning the odes they interpreted. Two scientists
measuring a bar of aluminum got results quite unlike
because one had a strong feeling that his previous
records showed too short readings. Very subtly one's
feelings weave their way into his thinking and give

it a direction that is due to the emotional tone. Of
course there are many obvious examples of people
who frankly allow their feelings to form their con
victions. Quite sensible young men have solemnly
informed me that they believed in the freedom of the
will because life wouldn't be worth living if they con
sidered themselves the result of the interplay of physi
cal and mental laws. Almost any good Christian
Scientist will tell you that she has embraced Mrs.
Eddy's doctrine because it makes her so happy. Not
a few of the thorough-going spiritualists admit that
their beliefs conform with their wishes, and that life
would be a sorry affair if they could not anticipate
immortality.
Primitive people and civilized adults do a great
deal of group thinking. By that I mean they conform
with the ideas of a group and willingly defend them.
Such convictions are often handed down from genera
tion to generation. They become firmly fixed. Only
the most hardy thinker dare set his ideas up against
the common belief. Seemingly, human nature is so
constructed it unwillingly admits changes in con
victions.
When a group of beliefs have become identified
with an organization, they acquire a great strength.
Rivalry with other organizations sharpens a belief
which is loyally defended. Science has for centuries
combated the beliefs of the organized churches. In
some instances science supplied concepts of greater

dignity and beauty than those the church held, but
the church fought vigorously against them. A reason
for this is to be found in the way that each man or
ganizes his ideas about the values of life. When a
man has satisfied himself that his life is a school and
preparation for a future life and has acquired habits
of feeling and acting in accordance with that convic
tion, it is clearly a personal disaster for him to aban
don such a belief. Here is the reason why men can
not change their thinking to conform with ideas that
are more logical than those they have been holding.
Again the primitive mind makes its appearance in
our present day, by following simple forms of reason
ing. Among men who have not had the benefit of
a thorough education and who possess simply an
average intelligence it is common to find them arguing
from one or two instances to a general conclusion.
Recently I heard a farmer maintain that hunting
dogs could not catch the scent of quail more than fif
teen feet away. This conviction arose from the fact
that our dogs missed a couple of coveys by about
twenty feet. Fishermen are full of stout beliefs that
certain fish do certain things and defend their state
ments with two or three examples. Every political
campaign supplies us with politicians who clinch
their arguments by citing a single case chosen from
history. Obviously this sort of thinking has nothing
in common with science. Since the time of Roger
Bacon, we have had the laws of induction clearly

before us. It is one of the characteristics of modern
science that no general conclusion can be drawn
while contradictory facts may be collected. Only
tentative laws may be established in many cases.
One of the best illustrations of scientific attack upon
a problem is afforded by Jenner before the time that
our modern science had established its methods.
Jenner cited so many cases where cow-pox made its
victims immune to small-pox that neither the skep
tical physicians nor the hostile churches could deny
him. Indeed, if any one thing characterizes our
modern science it is this insistence upon a large num
ber of observations to establish any generalization.
For some years psychologists have made a practise
of reporting the number of cases they use in their
experiments and they show mathematically how the
possibility of chance diminishes as they increase the
number of cases studied. Psychic research has been
deplorably faulty in the reports it has made in defense
of the principles it has claimed.
It is so easy to draw conclusions from simple anal
ogies that we find everyone doing it. With primitive
people it is very quaint and amusing. Loud noises
frighten away dangerous animals and sneak thieves
at night, therefore the evil spirit that rustles the
leaves by your window may be frightened away by
a loud shout. Fearful odors will drive anyone away.
For that reason the sick savage sometimes covers
his body with filth to drive the sick demon into other

quarters. Before we began to study the chemical
action of drugs upon the tissues of the body our an
cestors hit upon some analogies. If there was trouble
with the blood they used blood-root on account of
its red juice; if the liver made trouble they used liver
wort as it has a leaf shaped like the liver; eye-bright
with a spot like an eye was good for eye troubles;
bear grease coming from an animal with thick hair
was entrusted with the duty of growing hair on bald
heads. Since the radio has appeared, we find thou
sands of people believing in telepathy. A few in
stances where two people entertained the same
thoughts at the same time is interpreted as a principle
that one mind can affect another by thought-waves.
Since radio sending and receiving sets may be sta
tioned far apart and one mind communicate with
another by way of ether waves, it is plain that the
electricity in the nerve currents of one brain may
start an ether agitation which will cause the currents
in another brain to stir up like thoughts! To any
one who has dissected a brain this analogy is simply
maddening.
All through the thinking of primitive people and
little children runs a characteristic trait. In the
study of tribal beliefs the world over animism stands
out prominently. The minds of both children and
savages work in the same ways for the same reasons.
Children come into a world made up of things and
other people. Long before they adjust themselves

to things and understand them, they have learned to
adjust themselves to people. A baby of eighteen
months knows a very great deal about people. It
distinguishes between pleasant mothers and unpleas
ant nurses, boisterous fathers and diffident strangers.
Not a little shrewd understanding of human nature
may be seen in these little folk. After they have
fairly well acquainted themselves with human nature
they undertake the difficult task of adjusting them
selves to the myriad of things about them. From
their first training in adjusting themselves to human
nature they carry over habits into their management
of inanimate things. This is the explanation of a
child's behavior when the wheels of his toy stick and
he hits it and cries. This is why children endow dead
things with lively feelings. It is natural to them to
explain the moving cloud as a living thing, to think
of thunder and lightning as the expression of anger
by some feeling agent. This is a trait that easily
becomes fixed. All through life, not a few people
find themselves slipping back into this child habit.
A famous psychologist was caught in San Francisco
during the earthquake and fire. He ran out into the
streets and tried to escape the flames and falling walls.
Every way he turned some danger sprang up to face
him. So baffling did this become that it seemed to
him that there was a purpose in it. He found him

and gravity in terms of a personality. Something

monstrous and vicious with evil design seemed to
him to actuate the dangers around him. Another
scientist swimming in the ocean was caught by the
undertow. Swim as he would he slowly drifted out
to sea. He found that he gained shoreward if he put
forth his best efforts as the waves swept by him.
Soon it became a sort of combat between the swim
mer and the surf. Eventually a large wave hurled
him upon the beach. Slowly he rose and made a
face at the sea. In private he admitted that he had
felt as though the water were an antagonist. When
the struggle was over he had won over a vicious
opponent. This feeling was so strong that he didn't
resist the temptation to express his triumph. Every
day commonplace experiences bring out the same
traits in the ordinary citizen. He gets angry when
the lawn-mower jams, he kicks angrily when his self-
starter won't work, and he blames his luck as a pagan
would blame his god, when his horse loses the race.
Probably no human being ever loses this childish
habit.
Books have been written upon animism as it ap
pears among simple people. The term is derived
from the Latin animus, meaning "thought", "feeling",
"life". Inanimate things are animate among savages.
Naturally this must be so, for what they know best
has to do with human purposes, ideas, and emotions.
When they are provoked they slash out and smash

they fight vigorously for relief. Their tenderest
emotions lead them to care for their offspring. All
of these forces in human nature are thoroughly fa
miliar to them. Forces that flash thunder-bolts into
trees, forces that raise ominous clouds and terrific
storms, forces that gently shelter the hanging fruit
with shady leaves are all totally unknown to them.
What explanation can they give for the activities of
nature all around them? Quite obviously they must
make their interpretations in terms of what they
feel that they understand. This leads them to endow
the objects around them with natures somewhat like
their own.
Sharply contrasted with the sort of knowledge that
primitive people gather is the knowledge that modern
science has acquired. The outstanding distinction
between these two types is that modern science un
covers a principle of orderliness in the universe,
whereas the pre-scientific notions had a medley of
principles. Each stride forward that science makes
lays bare the connections which apparently separated
phenomena. Recently we have seen how the very
fine rays of ether forming the X-ray unite with the
great broadcasting waves of the radio. Each year
gives us a new insight into the secrets of nature. The
atom is slowly giving up its secrets. Twenty-five
hundred years ago, shrewd Greek thinkers claimed
that matter could be separated into atoms. Their

of atoms that our school boys know. Starting with
a simple element like hydrogen he learns that there is
a proton around which an electron circles; the next
element, helium, has one proton and two electrons.
Ninety-two elements fall into their places with beau
tiful precision as their protons and electrons form
different configurations. Search the universe where
we will and these two great natural and simple ar
rangements of waves and atoms are present. Con
ceptions of such beauty and grandeur were impossible
to men who interpreted the universe about them
piece-meal. Indeed, the trained scientist never looks
for sharp or abrupt changes in the principles that
underlie nature. All of his experiences lead him to
expect that the uniformities he has been finding will
continue into whatever realms he explores. This
striking contrast between the conceptions of the
modern trained mind and those of the primitive man
(and the inadequately educated) resembles the differ
ence between the methods of acquiring knowledge
before the time of Francis Bacon and those of our
day. Bacon became disgusted with the haphazard
way of trying to build up information about nature
in ways that were illustrative of all the traits of child
ish thinking that we have just noted. He insisted
that the only way to amass knowledge was by col
lecting a great mass of facts. Let the facts be what
they may, man's only obligation is to assemble them.

arrange them in various ways to discover whether
there is any principle or law that relates them. Of
course this is an ideal procedure. As a matter of
fact scientists usually make a guess concerning some
principle in nature and then search for facts to sup
port it or to reject it. Always the fact is the deciding
matter. That means good observations. Faulty
observation means distorted facts. Not a little of
the marvelous advance in recent years is due to im
provement in observation. The microscope, tele
scope and photography have been enormous aids.
But apart from these the insistence by scientists upon
many observations and especially controlled obser
vations have made for dependable knowledge. Thus
an Austrian monk hits upon a principle in nature
which shows that, by cross-breeding high-growing and
low-growing garden peas, their offspring will appear
with certain characteristics through a number of
generations. After a great number of experiments
and careful observations it was learned that this
principle applies not simply to plants but also to
animals. However, when we attempt to discover its
application to human beings, we cannot make such
accurate observations. We cannot experimentally
mate two people, acquire a lot of offspring and mate
them. Only as we make our observation under good
or controlled conditions can we hope for certainty.

the haphazard hit and miss ways of the average citi
zen. All of the superstitions that characterize our
fellow-men grow up because of the natural propensity
to think as men did before the time of Bacon. A
belief still persists with many uneducated people that
the moon has a great influence over the weather. It
is supposed that the new, full, and half moon may
bring about such changes. Not one of these believers
has even kept a true and faithful record of changes in
the moon and the weather to see whether they tally.
Throughout many sections of the country the people
will gather to pray for rain after a long drought.
Even the most courageous will often pray for protec
tion in a violent thunderstorm. Here is the old prin
ciple of animism, assuming a vague kind of mind
controlling precipitation and electricity. As for
superstitions concerning the sex of the unborn child,
they are legion. Slowly the superstition that the
thoughts and feelings of the mother will influence
the nature of her unborn child is disappearing. This
is because of discoveries in embryology. It is not
due to any careful observation on the part of parents
to discover whether such practices are practical.
From time immemorial men who raised crops have
appealed to their gods, demons, spirits and saints,
because so many chances controlled the growth in
their fields.

is a vague idea that luck is not simply chance. If
he is a firm believer in luck he will often have notions
as to how it works. He can cite instances of certain
days or numbers that have a peculiar significance for
him. Possibly he has a lucky stone or coin or curio
which he feels he must carry with him. This is just
one step above the animism of the savage with his
amulet. It may be exaggerating the notion of luck
to claim that it is animistic. With many people,
certainly, their conception of luck involves the idea
of some mystic plan or purpose.
We find the ordinary individual who has not had
high-school training and who is utterly unacquainted
with the habits of thinking that characterize the
trained scientific mind very prone to explain matters
he cannot understand in the simple ways of the primi
tive man or the child. Perhaps we should not limit
this observation to the uneducated as I have met a
number of college graduates who lapse into the same
sort of natural superstitions. For example I recall
a highly educated and very talented lady who did
automatic writing. I have seen her hand quickly
cover a page with perfectly intelligent sentences while
she was engaged in an animated conversation which
had nothing to do with which she was writing. She
tried to fight off the notion that her hand was con
trolled by an independent spirit. As she had no
explanation for the curious behavior of her hand and
as it seemed to move quite independently of her will
she was disposed to lapse into the type of thinking

which characterizes animism. Another educated
young lady saw a vivid appearance of her dead hus
band and knowing no explanation concluded that it
was an apparition. Many people hear voices speak
ing to them and will dimly glimpse vague faces look
ing at them when they are entirely alone. Com
monly they make their explanation in terms of
primitive thinking. Perhaps it is too much to expect
them to attempt experiments and to study the condi
tions under which these things occur.
It is rather disappointing to an educator in this
twentieth century to find a great number of people
who abandon the sort of mental habits they were
taught and who lapse into childish thinking, when
they receive some surprising message from a medium.
Time and again I meet such people who have had
some insight into scientific methods but who make
no effort to apply them. One or two striking ex
periences are sufficient for them. Indeed, the dispo
sition to lapse into superstition is so strong that
almost anything that is a little difficult to relate to
familiar things brings out the pre-scientific types of
thinking.
Naturally then we must expect to find a very great
number of people who are easily convinced of the
claims of spiritualism. It would seem that the nat
ural propensity to think as human beings have
thought for fifty-thousand years easily over-rides the
acquired methods of the last few centuries.
