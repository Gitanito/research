not failed to imp~e .!~P~~tedly on t.b~. understanding
of the ignorant, and by appealing to·accidental con-
tingencies, which for a n;i.o~t seem to favour their
e~:pirical spe~lations, .they h~ve oc~ionally ~en
by surprise the judgment of better·educatedindhi-

belief that they. ~~ ~e soqnqest facts, become pre-

the most ludicrous and incongruous assertions.
To tr~ the history of such conceits through the

; The attention of the public has !or som~ time past
dwelt with painful interest on tlie atrodties that.have
l~tely been perpetrate·d by Blirke,·and his niisei'abl~
confederate Hare ; and .although the hand of hfun~
nity would willingly draw a veil over the recollection)
of their enormities, yet, as they have been guilty of
.iniquities almost unexampled in the annals of crime,.
tlierecan be littledoubt that theywill long rank among
the most notorious and execrable murderers that ~ver
disgraced the history of human nature. The cruel-
ties repeatedly committed by them were indeed of tlie
niost deplorable and appalling descriptfon. They were
notprompted byth~ excitement ofprovocation,orsug-
gested by ·any frenzied desire·of vengeance ;-they
were not committed hi moments of 'sudden or impe.:
tlious passion, but all, on the contrary, was cold-blood.:
ed, selfish calculation ; and no savage in the remotest
Wilds of Africa ever heard more unmoved, or exutted
niore deliberately, over the repeated death-groans of
tlieir. victims.-" After they ceased crying and·'ma-
king resistance," says:the Confession of nhrke, "Jw~

left them to die of themselves, but their bodie.s would
often move afterwards, and for.some time they W<>Wd
heave long breathings bef~re life went away."
A'S it is stated by Phrenologists, that deliberate.
and se]fish murderers _possess always a large end.ow- ·
ment of the alleged organ of destructiveness, and a8 '
tae atrocities of ~u.rke and Hare are certainly of as
great, or even greater magnitude, than any of those ·
which were perpetr.ate4 by the criminals w:ho.supplied ·
Gall and Spurzheim with the evidence by which th.ey
pretended not only to discover, but subsequently to
eStablish this organ,-so in the cases of the West .
Port murderers, each should, on Phrenological prin-
ciples, possess it exceedingly well developed.

On ~he morning after.the execution of this crimi-..

and popular Professor Dr Monro, gave the same ·
morniDg a public dern~tration of the brain. In the .
course of this dissection nothing remarkable was ob- .
served, excepting a certain degree of softl:lesa of the
cerebral substance, which has been noticed by the

diet some weeks preVious to execution.• It has
been falsely and ignorantly stated to the public, that
the later~l cerebral.lobes we~e unusually developed,
and the skull in that region rendered in consequence
remarkably thin. Having made particular enquiries
on this subject, I am enabled, on the best authority,
to state positively, that no such remarkable develop-
ment was observable. The attenuation of the bone
alluded to refers to the squamous portion of the tem-
poral bone, whichis generally thinner than any other
partofthe cranium; andwere the statement,thereforer,
even admitted to be correct, it w~uld constitute no
pe~uliarity in the skull of Burke. I may add, that
I have examined many crania,.in which, although the
bones were much thinner generally, yet over the re-
gion of destructiveness they were much thinner and
more diaphanous, than in this murderer, without th~
slightest external protuberance. The etfect of any
unusual fulness of the cerebral convolutions, seems
indeed not to produce any elevation on the external
table of the cranium, but simply to attenuate the in-
ternal, which is observable in the indentations of th~
gla.ndula Pacckioni, which never produce any cor..
responding eminenceson the external cranial surface.t

· In this instance, although the cerebellum was sta:.
ted to be small, yet in proportion to the cerebrum i~
bears its appropriate size. The cerebellic cavity
measures in circwnference7.6 inchu ; in length i.5 ;
in breadth 1.9 ;-Total li, which is also larger than
Burke's.
I have now selected two of the most prominent
features in the character of Burke :-Firn, His ne..
structiveness as a cold-blooded, systematic murderer.
Second, His Amativeness, which is admitted to have
been excessive; and, directing the attention of the
Phrenologists exclusively to these manifestations;
have proved them to be directly at variance with his
Phrenological development. It is unnecessary ta
enter into minor details. My counter Phrenologi~
propositions are ;-
Fir8t, The organ of Destructiveness in ·Burke is
absolutely and relatively below the average size,
whilst Benevolence and Conscientiousness are
absolutely and relatively above the average size-.
Seooml, The cerebellum in Burke was also b~
the average siu.

way the precjge capacity of the living head, I find t<l

ted, found on a large induction, that the proportions of
the several organs to the lineal dimensions of crania,

Catholic~ he retorted, With a contemptuous sneer, he
" did not rightly mind what he was." To the ques-
tion, whether his conscience ever troubled him, he
answered, with a laugh, "No, with the help of God."
His whole demeanour was that of a man evidently
devoid of every moral reflection, and he seemed, with
his head adorned, as if in mockery of Phrenology~
with large organs of Ideality, Causality, and Wit, to
be only a few degrees removed from the very lowest
of the brute creation.
The counter Phren?logical propositions deduced
from the case·of Hare, are-
- First, The organ of Destructiveness is in this atro-
cious murderer not above the average size.
Second,·Many individuals of exemplary character,
at the same time that they possess the organ o~
Destructiveness larger than Hare, exhibit ~
__ greater deficiency in the alleged organs of Be-
nevolence and Conscientiousness.
.~ I have not, it may be added, referred to the sup-
posed organ of Amativeness, beingsatisfied that it is
impossible to ascertain its size by any external mani-
pulation. The uncertain and varying thickness of
the muscles at the back of the head and neck, must
alone oppose·a very considerable impediment to any
such. ~tension; in addition to- which, it has been
observed by Sir William Hamilton, that the snperior

served that the internal crucial spine sometimes de~
s~nds as much as an inch below, sometimes ascends
as much as an inch, or more, above the line of the
f;lxternal occipital; and the latter, therefore, is n.O
~riterion by which the manipulator can judge of the
tii$e of the cerebellum.

he was cori.ftned.

stoun fair with two men, his former companions, ha
overtook them on their road homewards, and barba-
l'OllBly murdered them ; after which, he took a knife
from his pocket, and mangled their bodies in a ·moeti
aa.vage manner. " . He was unanimously fuund
gt;rllty, and sentenced 'to be executed as near the 8Jd
where he committed the murders as ~hould be found

VII. Balfour.
This culprit was executed at Dundee, for murder·
ing his wife; in a fit ofjealousy.
.VIII. Gordon.
·This·inurdei:er was found guilty of killing John·
Elliot, a poor pedlar boy, rather weak in his in~
at a solitary place on the farm of Upper Cassock, in
the parish of Eskdalemuir, ·after which he robbed
him of his- pack. From the evidence, it appeal'ed
C4 ·that Gordon fastened himself on the unfortlmate
youth for three days, although they had ·no previoWJ
aci}uaintauce, was ·seen entering with him into the·
wilds of Eskclalemuir, about three o'clock in tl1e af.,.
ternoon, and, on the ·evening of the same day, was
8een emerging from these wilds aklne, 'in possession
of, and selling articles from, the paci4 which waa
identified as having belonged to the murdered bOy"
It was further proved, that the instrument made use
of.in committing the murder was a clog which was
wom by Gordon. The criminal behaved, during the .
address of the Lord Chief Justice, in a very unb&;

IX. Cockburn.
This murderer was executed for stabbing a mal!
with a knife, in a fit of passion. The crime was com-

~iculars.
· X. Lingard.
· This criminal was tried at the assizes in Derby.:.'
sh.ire for the murder of a woman who resided by her.;..
self at the toll-bar at Wardlaw Myres. in the parish ·
of Tideswell, in that county. The murderer was di&-·
covered, by circumstantial evidence, in a ·singulari
manner. He had, it appears, after committing the:
mtirder, taken all the money he could collect in.the•
toll-house, and with it a pair of shoes that had be.·
.
longed to the deceased. When the report of t;hei

XV. · M'Kean.
This murderer was executed in Glasgow. He was
a notorious and atrocious vip.ain, who, from the ear-
liest period of his life, was addicted to every species
-Of vice. He finally consummated his career of crime
by murdering a man named Buchanan, the Lanark
carrier. When under sentence of death, he wrote,
like Haggart, a narrativ:e of his -past life, which con-
tains, like all documents of a similar kind, much hy-

Maxims, remarks, that " Criminals sometimes, at

fect he could not tell ; .but when in the water, Pepe
discharged his piece at him, and·from the shriek that
followed as the poor fellow sank, he supposed it took
effect. Another witness states, that he saw Pepe.
leaning over a man .who .had fallen, and· having ~X·
claimed, " .Ak! not yet dead!" beat the body in a
brutal manner, and threw it overboard. After the .
bloody tragedy was completed, it is stated in the re.
port, ·that·they strided across the deck, exulting in
their victory,and resembling demons rather than men.
Each.contended for the honour of having pe~
red the greatest number of murder8. It is further
added, that Pepe confessed the first murd.er he com-
mitted was on a fellow-classmate at school, when.he
was only fourteen years of age, and he could not re-
collect how many he had since perpetrated.
The secretaryof the PhrenologicalSocietyatWash..

structiveness·constitUtes its characteristic peculiarity;

he·has examined, he.has never met with one so narrow.
in··this diinension. Here, therefore, is the skull of a:
cold-blooded.and"
execrable murderer, not only failing,
to possess a large organ of Destructiveness~ but pos-
sessing it, according to .any standard, absolu~ly and
relatively below the average. So triumphant a.case_

to have all the organs; but it reats on the inoontrove;r.:.
tible fact' of their possessing·i~ both in absolute and

by two measurements; jirat, the distance ·from the
meatus lo Lower Ilid,ividuality, which the Phrenolo-
gists themselves commonly take ; second, the dis-
t.ance from the meatus 1:o Causality, which, being
situatedhigher in the forehead, gives a better idea of
the comparative proportion of the anterior develop-
ment.

· ; The anterior development in the skull of Burke
is also fully proportioned to the general size of the
skull: I have, on this subject, satisfied myself by a
still more conclusive method of estimating the com-
parative quantities of brain before the ear. ·I have
measured·from meatus to meatus, with ·a piece of
string, passing it through the centre of the org8118 of
Comparison and Causality, and found decidedly, that
the crania of murderers exhibit no remarkable defi-
ciency of brain before the ear, or preponderance of
development in the region to which the animal pro-
pensities are referred. ·
In further confirmation of the several positions I
have maintained,Iproceed togive the measurementsof
the cranium of the late celebratedDr David Gregory,
who was Professor of Mathematics in the University
of Edinblll'gh, and subsequently appointed Savilian
Professorof Astronomy in Oxford. He was the dis-
.tinguished friend and companion of Sir Isaac ·New-
ton ; he was·the learned author of several valuable
.works on mathematical science ; and a man of high
moral and intellectual virtue. He died on his·way

·from Oxford to London, in Berkshire ; and the skull
is authenticated by the circumstance of its having
been taken from the place of interment by a gentle-
man, who transmitted. it to a distinguished indivi-
dual in this city, who has it still in his possession.
The capacity of this cranium, or the weight of its
encephalon, is 2177~ graim.
From Destructiveness to Destructiveness, is 5.7
inches ; and its proportion to the encephalon as I to
S820.S50.
The organ of DestructiveneS! in the learned Pro-
fessor is, in its ah1olute size, larger than the Nlite
organ in every murderer included in my induction ;
and, even in proportion to the general size of the
brain, larger than the same in Burke, Haggart, An~
4erson, Glen,Balfour,Pepe, Mortimur Collins,Clydes-
dale, and Divan.
The organ of Combativeness in the Profe8sor me.ii•
sures 5.6 inches, which islarger than the same organ

His organ of Acquisitiveness is 4.95 inclles ; Bal-
four h88 it the same ; and every.other munlerer has
it leas, including even the thieves Gordon, M'Kean,
arid Haggart.
His organ of Secretiveness is 5.7 incheB, wliich'is
larger than the same in each of the murderers.

miscreants, have it larger.
Even in proportion to the size of the enc~phalon,
Burke, Scott, Anderson, Balfour, Gordon, 'Cockburn,

have each a larger organ of Benevolence than the

in the University of Glasgow. I am also obliged to
the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, for the uae

byshire.

ting a fair enquiry into this subject some months ago,

pretended organs of Destructiveness, and of those of
the animal ptopensities in general, or by any defi-

To det.ennine this question, I shall briefly state to
the Society, that I have taken measurements of the
organs of Acquisitiveness and Conscientiousness, an4
at the same time, the general size of the head, in an
unselected class of individuals, English, Scotch, and
Irish, and compared these with similar measurements
from the heads of all the most notorious thieves in the
Edinburgh Jail and Bridewell.
·The number of these convicted thieves proved to be
i2 ; and of these, 20 are Scotchmen. The average
absolute size ofthe organ of Acquisitiveness in them,
is 5.525. The average absolute size of their organ
ofConscientiousness, 4.806 i11Cke1.

imperfect, yet the only one of which even Phrenolo-
gists canavail themselves. In the case of Hare, I have
'.~Ven the proportions of th~ several organs.. to·these

torious thieves, than in individuals of exenipJ.arY
character. .
The only comment I should conceive it necessary
to make on these deductions, is sufficiently expressed
by Mr Combe, who, in speaking of the truth or false-
hood of Phrenology, remarks : " If two individuals
were found to possess a larger development of .Ac..
quisitiveness; but if in the one Conscientiousness
was very large, and in the other very small, and'we
were told that·the one was a thief, and the other.·an
honest man, how complete wou).d the refutation be'
if the one possessing the larger Conscientio\J.sness
were found to be the rogue."• ·
The facts that constitute the present induction
were, I may repeat, taken without selection ;-in li-
ving individuals, I took the measurements of the firSt
who presented themselves, and with 'the several c~
nia adopted the same plan ; nor have I in a·single iri-
etance rejected the measurement of a person or cra-
nium, because it did not appear to accord with ariti-
Phrenological evidence. I have always supposed, and.
am confirmed in the opinion, that practical Phreno-
Iogy is dependent entirely on accidental contingen-
cies ; and when it is considered that we are referred
to thirty-five cranial prominences, which are the oom-
mon conditions of every head, and ~ as many Jacul.:..
ties which are t~e common attributes of every mind,
it may easily be understood, why the alleged·ch~;.
~ris.tic configurations will occallionally correspond
with the manifestations attributed ~ them,.and why

which have always been taken in the presence of im-
partial persons, many of whom will testify, that 86·
completely has this investigation been conducted
on experimental principles, that I did not, and could
not, until the whole had been concluded, antici•
pate the result of my induction. Among other·gen-
tlemen, I have in particular to thank Mr Deseret,
who is a professed Phrenologist, and a member ofthe
PhrenolOgical Society of Edinburgh, for having oc-
casionally superintended my measurements. Also
Mr Holroyd, my fellow-President in this Institution,
who has very frequently acted as·an impartial umpire
on such occasions.

· THE reader·is, in this Table, presented with the
measuiements of. all the certain male crania in the
Collection whieh· Dr Spurzheim sent from Paris to
this city, and which are at present ~n the Edinburgh
Museum. These crania were sent over to this coun-
try for:the purp~se of illustratipg the truth of Phre-
nology. The same evidence, therefore, may fairly
be adniitted in exposing its delusions.
TABLE II.
This Table pre.
sents the measli.rements of the heads
.of Engli.ak11UJR. ·. The. first teR are privates in the
Third ;Dragoon Guards,.quartered at Piershill bar-

Street ; the ten following are privates in the Third
Dragoon Guards ; and the remainingfive, gunners in
the Royal Artillery.
TABLE IV.
In this Table, the measurements of the heads of
Irishmen are presented. The first three are porters
from the stand in College Street ; the following ele-
f1en, privates in the Third Dragoon Guards; and the
remaining thirteen, gunners in the Royal Artillery.
TABLE V.
In this Table, measurements are presented of the
heads of the most notorious thieves at present con-
fined in the Jail and Bridewell of Edinburgh. One is
an Englishman, another an Irishman, and the r~­
maining 20 are Scotchmen.
TABLE VI.
In this Table the reader is presented with mea-
surements of the crania of executed murderers. The
skulls of 13urke, Haggart, Scott, Anderson, Glen,
Cockburn, and Pepe, are in the Edinburgh Anatomi-
cal Museum. That of Lingard is in the Museum of
the Royal Physical Society. The skulls of Macmil-

for the originality of their views, they have only been re-
viving and promulgating doctrines that were taught in the
earlier ages, and which, having been rejected by the most
enlightened of those times, fell into that oblivion, from
whence, within the last thirty years, they have been res-
cued, without the slightest reference or acknowledgment.
Aristotle first assigned di1Ferent operations of the mind
to dlll'erent parts of the brain.• He also speaks of the fa..
culties being indicated by certain forms and projections of
the skull, which passage has been quoted with reprobation
by Pliny,t who seems to wonder why Trogus Pompeius,
bis predecessor, "a most accurate writer," should have co-
pied from ·Aristotle such " frivolous remarks." The ob.
jection.of Pliny was that of a philosopher, and rested on
their induction being founded on the observation of a single
part, instead of the whole system.+ He names the science
"Metopo1copy ;"§ and adds the curious fact of its having
been applied, almost.as w~ see it in modern time11, to the
portraits painted by Apelles. Suetonius, under the same
·appellation, mentions a report, that it bad been applied
to the heads of Britannicus and Titus Vespasian, when
schoolfellows together in the palace of the Emperor Clau-
dius.II It is, however, important to observe, that the
ancients always considered Metoposcopy, or Phrenolo-
gy, as it then existed, a vulgar superstition. The Cra..

niologic diTiner was never introduced by any of the royal
family, not even by the j0cular, good-tempered father of
Titus, but by Narciuus, a manumitted slave. Juvenal
expreealy represents " The Science" as a superstition of
the vulgar only, and satirizes the degrading extent to which·
the higher order of females we~ addicted, ~o the astro-
logic arts. " But if she be poor," (says he) " she will
draw.cuts with straws, or nretch out her faehtotd to the
seer, who generally has a smack for his pains.•·• C~
alludes to the same doctrine, when he mentions " Zopyrus
the Physiognomist, who pretended to decypher the dilJ>O-
aitions and characters of individuals from their penom,
eyes, countenance, and forehead.'~t
In the thirteenth century, Albertus Magnus pointed out
the suppoeed sites of the several mental faculties ; and
·Peter de' Montagoana published a plate, representing
their several relative positions and sizes. Vesalius, writing
in lM!, condemns such notions, as being arrogant and
impious; and denominates the p~renologist of that time a
·" would-be Prometheus," and " a forger upon the great
impress of the divinity."t He quotes Thomas Aquinu,
Scotus, and Albertus Magnus, as the most repreheDBibJe

The phrenological theorists of the present day triumph-
antly assert, that Drs Gall and Spurzheim were the first
who, instead or founding their opinions upon speculative
reasoning, drew their deductions from observation, oom-
paring; as they proceeded, the peculiar appearances of dif.
ferent heads with the dispositions and talents of living in-
dividuals, and also referring to the evidenee of comparative
anatomy, to elucidate further the correctness of their infer-
ences. The opinions to which we have referred were also,
it appears, founded on similar comparisons, and facts aa
important brought forward to substantiate them. Thus,-
" The little forehead denotes a person indocile, weak,
and given to mischief, believing in nothing but his own
foolish opinions. They are compared among the beasts to
the cat or rat of Pharaoh. The Emperor Caligula had it :
so aleo was he an epitome of all cruelty and cowardice, and
would never believe any J>(!rson of authority."t

"A square forehead, according to Aristotle, denotes mag•
nanimity. Those that have such a forehead are courageous
aslions; and are compared tothem,becauseoftheir strength,

the characters, actions, and destiniesof men, by " the sym-
metrical proportions of the body," or" the internal aft'ec-
tions of natural bodies by the external signs thereof.'• Thus
may Phrenology, under thishead, be appropriately charac-
terized as " The art efdi'Dining certain evil propennnea,
flObk aentimniu, and ingmiow powers eflhe mind, by dt-
roers rtmarkabk appearances and protuberance1 on the e:c-
temal S'Urface ef the skuU." Its history is, indeed, un-
walleled in the annals of modem science. Whenever the
phrenological theorists discovered any peculiar enlarge-
ment or prominence on the cranium, and found it existed
in a number of persoos remarkable for possessing any si-
milarity in dispoeition or talent, it was with them, we are
informed, quite sufficient to establish an immediate relation
between cause and effect, inferring from thence that the
protuberance without was occasioned by the development
of the brain within, and that the part of the brain in ques-
tion was necessarily, therefore, the isolated organ of some
apeaial faculty; never, by the way, pausing to enquire
whether such cranial prominences are, in reality, occaaioo-
·ed by the development of the cerebral substance, or whe-

we have adverted, it was, therefore, essentially a doctrine
of ezlemal signs; and, as relating solely to the cranium,
wu appropriately termed " craniology, or cranioscopy."
Dr Spurzheim, however, has, within the last few years,
without assigning any sufficient reason, changed the name,
and dignified it with the·more specious and'imposing title
'
of" Phrerwlogy," .or the doctrine efthe mind, although it ia
one oftheiravowed and reiterated acknowledgments,that the
theory has been devised and established without any investi-
gatian into the nature or phenomena of the thinking prin-
ciple. Bacoo,Descartes,Locke,Leibnitz,Kant~ areall, With
their acute reasonings, formally denounced bythe phreno-
logical usurpers. They, it is urged, contented themselves
with studying only by reflection the several subjecta ·of
Weir consciousness ; they suspected not that the brain w:u
a congeries of so Diany distinct mental organs ; tkefJ were
lamentably ignorant of the exS!lusive existence and mono-
poly of the thirty-five special faculties. The phrenologi-
cal philosophy claims, accordingly, the special ·honour of
being "quite distinct from every other;·•--critical, tran-
1eeodental, or natural. It remains, therefore, for us toex-
amine its several propositions, to determine whether thia
distinction should be a subject of congratulation ·or re-
proach.

· Dr. Spurzheim himself has replied to these remarks;
and, as being one of the founders of the phreDQlogical aya.

has this to do with Dr Barclay's statement ? That·dis-

difficulty in distinguishing one Whe ef the brain from ano-
ther; consequently, this is altogether an ev.asion of the
question. Dr Spurzheim then proceeds,-" In the same

way, I should never confound the organ of amativeneu
with that of philoprogenirivenesa, or philoprogenitiveness
with that ofeecretiveness, or the organ of the desire to ac-
quire with that of benevolence or veneration ; and Dr
Barclay may be ture, if he make it hil atu<l!J to compare
llae conjiguratitma ef the cerebral conoolutiona, and of the
differnit orgam, hewillfind great dijferencea, 'UJhich he ha8
hitlaerlo overk>oked."' This specimen of reasoning ought
not to be passed lightly over. It is a style of argument
no man would have recourse to, excepting as a dernier rea-
aort, when be really knows not what to say. The compa..
rison instituted between the cerebral lobes and the phreno-
logical organs is quite illegitimate, and involves a petitio
principii. The query elicited by Dr Barclay's observa:.
tions is simply as to the identity of the several organs. It
is not, therefore, sufficient to say, study the cerebral con-
oolutionl, as ifevery convolution was itself a distinct or-
gan. How are the numerous phrenological organs to be
distinguished from one another, that are crowded together,
not only in the same lobe, but the same convolution? This
perplexing point Dr Spurzheim altogether evades, and
sums up his unsatisfactory answer with the following most
preposterous assertion.-" Moreover, whe'li 11.e 1hall aee,

Profeuor Rudolphi, in Germany, went somewhat further
~Dr Barclay, and, instead of questioning whether the
organs can be distinguished from one anolber by any dU.
tinctive characters in the brain, restahia objection on the~
possibility of recognizing them when apart. " Shew Dr

aarily destit>yed. According to the phrenological sdiemt;
dilFerent states of mind are conceived to originate separate.
ly, and independently ofeachother, by the supposed activity
of different material organs. Dr Gall attributes to each of
these organs five degrees of activity, occasioning Percep-
tion, Memory, Recollection, Judgment, and Imagination.
On the other hand, Dr Spurzheim allows only three, which
give rise to Perception, Memory, and Judgment. The
brain is thus made an aggregate of so many distinct minds;
and, to reconcile their even acting in conjunction, phreno.
logists must have recourse to a gratuitous supposition, an
hypothetical idea, that, by a law peculiar to each, they
all act in perfect harmony. Neverthe1es8, no osten~ible
reason can be adduced to explain why this should happen;
for, as three degrees of activity are attributed io each or-
gan, and as their functions are all different, it is evident
there may be as many different degrees or kinds of action,
going on in every part of the brain, ~ there are organs,
multiplied by the degrees of activity in each. Thus, 85
organs, multiplied by S, equal 105, and including the 5
senses, which make 15 more, we inay have no less than 120
actions carried on in the same organ, every 55 of which
may be simultaneously in operation.
The supposition, that different states of thought and
feeling originate1
separately and independently from one
another, through the instrumentality of perfectly distinct
agents, will thus be' found incompatible with the evidence
of our personal or mental identity. Identity, says Dr
Brown, is a relative term. " It implies, in every instance,
a double sensation of some sort. The identity of our mind

i1dlte mere COMidwati.on qfthue M nccuri~e."
Upon the phrenological hypothesis, however; inetead ol.
regarding our several thoughts and feelings aa relatioDs of
the same mind to any of its own antecedent stat.et, they are,
we are distinctly told, considered « ~tiom <:A. the simpjt
substa~ mind, to certain ponions of the encepbaloo.,..
It, therefore, ia evident, that, by thia theory, not ooJy it
the relation of one state of mind to another interrupted,
but an absolutely different thinking principle is e1tabliahecl
between them. Thu~ the perception, memory, and judg.
ment, arising from the " three degrees of activity" pecu·
liar to the organ of veneration, must be essentially dift'er.
ent from the perception, memory, and judgment, that re-
sult from the functional activity of every otbeJ' ~ ilt
the system.
The unity of consciousneu, and the evidence of our per.
sonal identity, would hereby neceuarily be destroyed; no't

Dr Spurzheiln, accordingly, perceiving the inadequacy
of this reply, aaautnes a loftier tone, one infinitely more
IUited to the ieal of a theorist, and the dignity of a phre-
nologist. " The explanation of this phenomenon," he ob-
eenes, ·(which is certainly incompatible with our sublime
ditcoveriea,) " may, indeed, remain unknown for ever;
but it is not the less true, that the brain is double, and

In other words, " appearances are certainly very much

absolutely right." Sic 'D<i«J, aicjubeo, atat pro ratione vo-

Instances of partial insanity have been brought forward,
with the view of establishing the phren<?logical principles;
but these, if impartially examined, will, I apprehend, have
a very different tendency. Dr Spurzheim considers that
the proximate cause of all mental ·derangement is disease
in the brain ; and he supposes that the peculiar character
of the symptoms depend on the morbid affections of parti-
cular organs. Hence we are informed that, " in mania, the
organ ofdestructiveness suffers most ; in ·melancholia, that
of cautiousness. When the organ of self-esteem is disor-
dered, the symptoms that arise are very differentfrom those
that characterize disorders of the organ ofbenevolence or of
veneration: accordingly, there are as many sorts of symp-
toms as there are primitive faculties of the mind and their
combinations."• Unfortunately for this theory, those fa-
culties which, in mental derangement, appear to be prin-
cipally affected, are those which, not being considered as
pri!Jlitive, constitute no part of the phrenological system,
and, therefore, have no distinct material organs. These
·are volition,attention, memory, and judgment. Meiaphy-
sicaJly considered, therefore, we find, that, in insanity,fa.

N~ subject is more involved in obecurity than the patho-
.logy of insanity. We have not sufficient data to proceed
uP:m to enable us to establish any relation between the
·conditions of the brain and the different states of men~l
aberration. Numerous are the instances where, after tbe
most complete state of mental derangement bu existed, the
ablest pathologist has been unable to detect the slightest
alteration in the cerebral s~ucture; and, on the other hand,
although no previous symptoms ?f mental alienat.ion have
been manifested, the brains of those who have died of apo-
plexy; epilepsy, orconvulsions, have been found very much
disorganized. We have also many instances on record ofin-
dividuals who have lived for years, enjoying perfect health,
and the exercise of all their faculties, notwithetanding·tbe

suffers·as a single organ ; nor are morbid·appearances pre-
sented to us only in those distinct parts ·of it which are

may, nevertheless, have been principally deranged.
Haslam relates the case ofa young woman, aged twenty,
whose insanity was occasioned by religious'enthusiasm, aod
a too frequent attendance on conventicles. She was in a
very wretched and unhappy condition, and terrified with
·the mo~t alarming apprehensions for the salvation of her
.aoul. She sang, wept, and prayed alternately; and, after
conti_
nuing some time in this forlorn and pitiable state, she
died. Here, we may presume, the phrenologists would
have inferred disease of the organ of veneration. On eU.
.minatiOI), the pia mater was found inflamed, and an extra:.
vasated blotch, about the size of a shilling, was seen upon
-the membrane in the middle ofthe lateral side·of the right
lobe of the cerebrum. There was no effusion between the
membranes, or into the ventricles, but a general determio-
··.uon of blood to the contents of the cranium.•

attained·hs highest degree of development, which ii gene.
rally about maturity, then the mental manifestations ha•e
the 'greatest energy. On investigation, however, it appears
that no ·such Co-relation does ·exist ; and that the brain
attains its fullest complement in size before the evolutioo
of the intellectual faculties. Sremmering, in the explana-
tion of his " Tabula B<Ueoa Encephali," states that this
organ is fully developed at thn;e years of age, which opin-
ion, it appears,.he has subsequently relinquished. The
Wenzels have investigated this subject more minutely·;
and, from the result of their'observations, demonstrate th~t
the brain acquires its fullest increment in size at the age of
seven years, when they ob8erve, " lllo anno cerebntm ho.
minis et qtioad totum et quoad singulas partea absolutum
eue videtur." *-" In no one faculty," they add, " .is a
boy of this age entirely deficient, but all are in a state of
inactivity. He is conscious of sensation, perception, judg-
ment, desire, memory, imagination, fancy, reflection ; but
all of these faculties, if not exercised, are inert and inope..
rative. Habits of observation, and the force of intellect,
grow upon him apace ; in collective trains of ideas be in-
stitutes comparisons, and draws conclusions ; still no ab-
solutely new mental faculty is added, but all acquire •igour

ces them as incorrect : yet we are to remember that the
Wenzels-not the avowed advocates of.any favourite theo-
ory--caine impartially to their ·conclusions after a aeries of
inductive experiments ; whereas Dr Spun:heim, zealous in
the support of his own system, oppoeea them merely with
a gratuitous urtion. The opinion of the W enzels, that
the brain does not increase insize after seven years of age,
is corrobOrated by the experience of hatters, who find that
the bead does iiot enlarge much after that period. we
are, on this subject, inucb indebted to Dr MilligaD for the
following interesting information.

It is therefore satisfactorily provei., that thebrain attains
its full increment in size long before the intellectual facul-
ties are fully developed ; consequently the powers of the
mind cannot be considered as being evolved by the gradual
enlargement of the cerebral subatance. No anatomical re-
search is, indeed, necessary to prove the supervention of
mental energy after the age of maturity. The fact is suf-
ficiently exemplified in the lives of many eminent men, as
in those of Cornaro, Swift, and Walcott.

Daubenton and Bufl'on have shewn, that the brain of
some of the monkey tribe (the Sapajota, or monkeys of
.America) is larger in proportion than to that of man ;
nevertheless, they exhibit no corresponding superiority, but
are inferior in intelligence to those even of their own
~es whose brains are considerably less.
Cuvier remarks, It appears that, all things considered,
the smaller animals have proportionally the largest brains.•
Instance the mole, the rabbit, the mouse : in the cetacea,
the dolphin and porpoise; and, in birds, the eagle, falcon,
blackbird, canary, sparrow, linnet, &c. The sheep, rat,
and field-mouse, have, in proportion, more brains than the
elephant, horse, or dog ; yet we all know how much the
latter excel the former in their powers of intelligence.t
The general proposition which, since the time of Aris-
totle, had been laid down, that man, has a larger brain, in
proportion to the size of his body, than any other animal,
being, by these fact&, controverted, Soemmering has insti-
tuted another point ofcomparison, viz. the ratio which the
bulk of the brain bears to the size ofthe nerves proceeding
from it. His method is, to divide the brain into two sec-
tions,-the one comprehending that part immediately con- .
oected with the aensorial extremities of the nerves, which
receives impressions, and is therefore devoted to the wants
and purposes of animal lift>,-the other including the rest
of the brain, which is to beconsidered the seat of the intel-
lectual operations. t The brain of the horse is cited as an
illustration : and, in this example, the absolute.s.ize of the

The predominant dispositions, and the abilities of the
mind, may, according to the theory we are considering, be
discovered by the relative sizes of the phrenological or-
gans ; but, on this subject, Dr Spurzheim speaks with less
decision than Mr Combe. " We employ," says the form-
er, "the size of the cerebral parts to determine their func-
tions ; but the activity of the organs cannot be measured
by the size alone." t The latter lays it down as a rule,
that " every faculty desires gratification with a degree of
I
energy proportionate to the size of its organ ; and those
faculties will be habitually indulged, the_
organs of which

the arcaM imperil of Phrenology, to indulge in any-ab-
struse disquisition on the relative powers and activitiet oC
particular organs, it is incumbent on us to inquire whe-
ther any of ~eir several dimensions can be determined.
~ The size of every organ, it appears, is to be ascertained by
its length and breadth,-the first being estimated by the .
distance of its surface from the medulla oblongata,-the
second by the extent of its peripheral expansion. We are
to judge of them relatively; that is to say, taking into con.
sidera_tion the general size of the head, ·we are to remem-
ber how many are included in a given region, and each is
then to be assigned its appropriate situation. Yet, how
are their individual ai:tea, then, to be ascertained? · The
founders of the system, as we have already seen, acknow-
ledge, that it is impossible to discover the limits of the se-
veral organs: how, therefore, is it possible to determine
the exact size of their individual expansions ? The .an-
swer of the Oracle is, " They are to be recognized
by experience"--e.rperience !-that experience which has
never failed to quicken the penetration, mature the judg-
·ment, and perfect the abilities of every practitioner in the
art of divination, from the time of theearliest necromancers
down to that of the dildtanti calliper professors of the pre-
sent day.
The activity of the organs, which cannot, according to
Drs Gall and Spurzheim, be determined by their size and
configuration alone, depends, we are informed, on their in-
ternal temperaments, four of which are particularly speci-
fied as increasing or modifying the energy of the several
facultiea.

nological supposition.
When Napoleon beaded the army of Italy,-when he be-
came first consul,-when he-
ascended the throne of France,
-how diil'erent was the temperament of·his constitution to
that which, when a prisoner in the island of St Helena,
arose from the anxiety and remorse of a perturbed mind,
that, like the Promethean·vultUre, preyed unceasingly on
hill' rest ! His disposition, in early lifo, was over sanguine
and aspiring; yet, when the day of his disasters arriffd,
and the star ef his destiny began visibly to decline, his
habits, thoughts; feelings, assumed a different tone; and
he became, in every sense of the word, of a lymphatic
temperament. Assuredly, this arose from external circum-
stances, that affected hie constitution generally; nor can it
be considered, in any case, as an original condition of or-

ness of the vegetative and intellectual functions." ·We do
not, indeed, find that it baa invariably any such effect.
Montaigne and Dr Johnson both lived under its influence;
yet, in neither case, did it impair the vigour or activity of
their mental powers.
Examplea of those who, in early life, possessed the san-
guine temperament in a high degree, are more particularly
calculated to show how incidental circumstances may effect
a complete revolution in the system, and give rise to a di£.
ferent and quite a contrary habit and disposition.

was detained a prisoner at Ferrara, whei:e
he was visited with a series ofpersecutions, that aftlicted him.
with an habitual and profound melancholy, from. which he
never eventually recovered. The bitterness of grief, like
the simoon of the desart, swep~ its withering influence over
his heart ; and no more possessed of that sanguine dispo-
sition, which rises superior to misfortune, he relinquished
every hope of future happiness. " My tears," says he,
" will now prevail no more below. Those who pledge me
their faith, mock my sufferings, and break their own pro-
mises. There will never, I believe, be an end to this un-

feature of his mind and disposition assumed an absolutely
new and different character.

The bilieua temperament, which is characterized by
great "general and functional activity," is alwa,,. excited
by those circumstances that at particular periods call forth
gTeat bodily and mental exertions. It is, consequently,
found to prevail with tboee men who have, by a certain
ooncatenation of events, been enabled to raise themselvea
to high situations in the public state, to preserve which
they have, in a manner, been obliged to signalize them-
&elves by superior energies. Examples, therefore, of thia
kind arefound in Alexander, Julius Cresar, Brutus, Charles
XII., Cromwell, Cardinal Richelieu, &c. The determi.
nate characters of such men are unquestionably the result
of those peculiar and varied causes which contribute to
place them in those oonditions in life that give rise to and
IDOdify their after dispositions. Thus it is too true, that
" men are the slaves of circumstances, when Circumatancea
seem the 11laves of men.''
The nervous temperament, like the preceding, will be
found to be occasioned by 'external causes. This may, io.
deed, be inferred f~m its generally aft'ecting only a cer.
tain class of people,-from its being more prevalent at one
period than at anotber,-from its being frequently the
consequence of some perceptible and accidental derange..
ment ohhe organic functions,-and from its being excited
by long continued or violent mental emotions ; such 81J
love, anxiety, fear, and grief. Even in those cases when

this habit appears hereditary, it should be considered
as a modification of disease, which may, with .a due at-
tention to regimen, be overcome. It is in the fashion-
able circles of society, not in the bumble walks of life,
that we find it principally predominate. There self-indulg-
ence, indolence, and luxuries, that are ever the attendants
on wealth, occasion all that excess of sensorial excitement,
whi~h too visibly diminishes the happiness of those who
have, by the advantages of birth, been relieved from the
necessity of those salutary occupations which Providence
has made essential to our well-being. In those periods
when the progress of art has removed us the farthest from
a stllte of nature, this temperament is most general. ·'Ac-
cordingly, we are informed that nervous affections were
more numerous among the Roman ladies during the decline
of the Roman empire, when the habits of society had be-
come exceedingly vitiated. ·They prevailed also to an un-
usual extent during the eighteenth century, and imme..
diately preceding the dissolution of the French monarchy,
at which epoch appeared the works of Whytt, Raulin, Lor-
ry, and Pomme.· Several of the most eminentmen of these
times, among others, ·Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Frede..
rick, possessed this habit in a high degree ; and the histo-
.ry of their agitated lives sufficiently explains the causes
of its development.•

del'ed as originally forming a part of the organization of

with t1re phrenological organs, appears obviously-a chime-
ra. It is on the hypothesis of their being " organic oonati-
tutioos"only,that phrenologists have beenled toendow them
with the occult power of exciting different degreea of acti-
vity in certain parta of the encepbalon. Thus they have
falle~ into the error of mistaking the effect for the cause,
inasmuch as these temperaments are, aa we have seen, the
ejfectl of the mind acting on the body, and not themselves
o.rganic causes, that excite a mechanical activity of the ma,.
terial substance, with which they.are supposed to be phy-
sically connected.
The absurdity of t.IJis theory consists more especially in
the fact of every organ being endowed with its orm conati.
tutional temperament ; ao that there are aa many tempera..
ments in the brain aa there are organs, all ofwhich being pe-
culiarconditions oforganization, areindependent ofexternal
circumstances, and those stat.ea of the health that may sub.
aeqtJently affect the body. Furthermore, it appears that
there is no possible mode of judging of the activity ofthese
organs. The majority of them may be p<Uaive, or, as D .
Spurzheim termsit, " dormant," wheneverit suits theconve-
nience of the phrenologist ; and, on the i>ther hand, a single
organ may, all of a sudden, become inordinately active, so
as to surmount all possible control, and hurry the fodivi-
dual along, whether he wishea it or not, like the unfortu-
~ate Ancient Mariner driven over the " wide wide sea" by
the " lonesome spirit of the south people," that doubtleas
urged him onwards very much against his own inclination.
More consistent and plausible is the theory of Th~mas
de Troiavevres, who represents the influence of the tempe-

ca~ities, each ofwhich being possessed with its own tempe-

Whatever standard of comparison we may adopt to es-
timate the weight or size of the brain, it is clearly ascer-
tained, and even admitted by the phrenologists, that cer-
tain animals have a larger brain in proportion than man,
and that the degree of intelligence, in no case, depends on
its absolute volume. As, therefore, the law which applies
to the brain fJ8 a whok will apply to it equally in till it8 in-
*'Oidualparts, 80 it must be inferred that the absolute or
relative size of certain portions of this organ can never be
considered asindicative ofany superioror inferior degree of
mental energy. The phrenologists, therefore, wisely have
recoune to an hypothesis which is 80 much " in_double
darkness veiled," that it cannot, on either side, be demon-
strated or comprehended. It is impossible toconceive how
the mechanical activity of certain parts of the brain can
give rise to different states of perception, memory, and
judgment; and the induction from whence this conclusion
has been drawn, resting, as it does, on the supposed orga-
nic cet"ebral temperaments, is so purely imaginative, that it
exceeds the bounds of reason, probability, and common
1ense. Siu is one condition necessary to activity, and the
foncy of the phrenologist himself appears to be the other ;
consequently, there is no definite principle or rule laid

'frith the intern~l configuratio'll of the brain, the impoesibi.
lity of discovering, during life, the development of tlrole
parts of it which -are considered different organs, will be
1Sufticiently obvious. The evidence on this subjectdoes DOt
rest on any abstract or speculative reasonings. To eotae
to a satisfacrory conclus~, it is necessary only to imtitute
\m investigation into facts·' that are within the reach of
'ef'e't'J inquiM'.
The skull coMists of t'tfo layers of booe, an extemal and
aninternal, which are separated hom a.ch other by a diploe,
or reticularnet.work, that iB interspersed between them.
Theinternaltable is that which, properly speaking, form&
the covering and protection to the brain ; while the exter-
nal, which is firmer Nid thicker, gives additional security
to the enclbsed organ, and is connected with the bones of
the face. In proportion, therefore, as the facial bones in-
crease in size, the ext'ernal table is separated from the in-
Google
51
ternal, and the diploe between them becomes m<>~ or le'8
thick and irregular.
The paralleliim of the two tables is hereby destroyed,
and protuberances and enlargements formed on the exter-
Dal table, that have no corresponding representations qpop
the internal.
The action of the mu11Clea has a considerable effect in oc-
-ciuioniog this inequality, tmd in determinini the size~
ClODfiguration of the skull.
In mammiferoua animals, in birds, and some reptilu, the
internal face of the occipital bone represents the general
tize and figure of the cerebellum, and the extremities of
the posterior lobes of the cerebrum ; but the mu&eles that
are attached to theexternal table draw it, to a certain extent,
from the internal, and give ihe bone without an extent ofsur-
fa<ie and form proportionate to the mechanical power they
exert.• Hence aoimale h4lving the head placed obliquely,
in wh001 theee mullclea are very firm and strong, have ~
occipital bone disproportionately large, compared with thf!
rat of the skull. This we find the case in the lion, the
byama, elephant, rhinoceros, &c. Thlil mQscles liave a si-
milar influence over the central bones, which 1D&y be cop..
aidered as forming the arch ol the cranium. In the Afri-
can Negro and Carib, the temporal mu&eles being thickeir
aod strooger than in the European, the crania of those
people are found narrow and ooinpre•sed at the sides.
In the Mongolian nriety, the characters of the bead
are of an opposite description. The cheek bones are pro-

minent, visage flat, and the cranium is of a square form,
with its prominences exhibiting a tendency to lateral pro-
jection.• This difference is accounted for by the deficien-
cy of the compressing force, the effects of which are so re-
·markable in the examples of the African·Negro and Ca..
rib.t
The same cause has a considerable influence in deter-
mining the configuration of the skulls of all animals:
Those with a powerful under-jaw, and large temporal and
masseter muscles, having the subjacent bone proportionate-
ly depressed; those, on the contrary, where the action of
the lower jaw is less considerable, and these muscles do
not exert so great a physical force, having the depression
nearly effaced.t
In the lion, tiger, wolf, &c. the temporal bone is exter-
nally most depressed over the part where the subjacent brain
is most fully developed ; and the zygoma of this bone, so
prominent in these animals, extends over the part where it
is least developed.II
In the centre of each parietal bone is a prominence, not
occasioned by the cerebral development, but by its beir~g
the point from whence the osseous fibres radiate. At the
centre of theunion of these bones, along the median line of
the head, there extends internally the longitudinal sinus,
separating the two hemispheres, so that the brain d~ not
there come in contact with the bone.

CODgeries of phrenological organs, it would still be impos-
sible to ascertain their positions and sizes externally, from
the notorious fact that the convolutions ha\le no symmetri-
cal correspondence to each other in the two hemispheres.
In 18~, Dr Spurzheim affirmed, that they are, " in their
.form and direction, remarkab'/11 regular.''• In 1828, in his
correspondence with Sir William Hamilton, be directly
abandons this position. In the words of Magendie, " the
number, the volume, the disposition of the convolutions,
are variable. In some brains, they are very large ; in others,
they are leas, ~d more numerous. Tli.ey 01re dijferentlg
OUpOled in every individual; and tll08e efthe right aide
Me not dilp08ed like those efthe 'left."t The Wenzels, to
whose authority I may again refer, completely establish
this fact. The organs nevertheless must, in every in-
'tiividual, retain the same relative positions on the external
tables of the skull, although the cerebral substance of one
may frequently occupy the place, or be within the boun.
dary, that is assigned to another.
In the anterior part of the head, the tables of the frontal
bone are, we find, separated from eachother by intervening
spaces, or sinuses, which give the external table an eleva..
tion, and alone have a very considerable effect in determin-
ing the size and configuration of the forehead. It is of
considerable importance to ascertain how far these sinuses

gans they commonly affect. Thia question ia easily deter-
mined hy an appeal to fact. A consid~able number ol
crania have lately been opened with this view ; and it ap-
pears that the frontal sinuses extend over a greater
surface than has hitherto been suppoeed. Sir William
Hamilton, in a lecture at the Edinburgh Unifenity,
exhibited the open crania belonging to that mu~um, wjth
a number of other specimens, and thereby demonatrated
that these sinuses, which are very unequal in their extent
and depth, affect frequently as many, and often more, than
one-third of the principal phrenological organs; and that
the retirement of the internal table, from the irregularities
and protrusions on the external is so considerableas to ren..
der it impossible to discover, b.y any external manipulation,
the general size and development of the particular parts '1
the brain. '
MrCombe, perceiving itnecessary to makesomereply,de-
livered a lecture on the same subject in the Edinburgh Aa-
sembly Rooms, producingall the counter specimenshe CO\lld
find for that occasion. As this question is one which must
ultimately be decided by the number of facts brought for-
ward, and as Sir William Hamilton's collection of crania
was so very extensive, it was incumbent on the phrenolo-
gists to bring into the arena, not only the 1ekct apecimeos
which they have been gathering in their own museum, but
as many other examples as they could possibly collect.
Mr Combe, aware of this fact, and assuming all that plau-
sibility which has, when dexterously managed, so fine a
stage effect, has announced to the public that he triumph-
antly refuted Sir William Hamilton's demonstrations, not

simply by the oollectioo ol aklllls·from the Clyde Street
Hall, but by the wltole of the open crania from a private
museum, which were doubtless,from their 11umher, trans.
f«red to the scene of action with considerable difficulty.
" I mentionedt says he, " to the audience that Mr

Phrenological Society; hereby enabling every individual
pre91Dt, after ocular inspection., to decide for himself on
the parallelism of the inner ud outer tables of the cranium,
as well u on the frequency and extent of the frontal sinus.
By using Mr Syme's specimens, the -charge of aelection waa

this intelligence, whereby we are induced to suppose that
a considerable number of open skulls w~ brought down

by such a miserable expedient?
The truth is, those who have the opportunity of .vi-
siting either public or private museums, and examiningany
number of open craoia, will find, that the·froatal ,siailses
amoog men, as among nations, vary considerably. They
are, in e<rery individual, very different and.unequal in their
height, breadth, and depth, extending most-commonly.ova
aeven, frequently over t'(J)elve, and sometimes over airtetm,
of the most impertant organs of the ph.renological sys-
tem.
· While these .sinuses exhibit.this variety, there is no pos-
sible means of ascertaining, during life, their extent. It
has, indeed, been stated that their.presence is always indi-
cated by a bony crest, while that of the .orgaµs is cha..
racterized by distinct and isolated. protuberan~.; but.the
fact, in contradiction to this assertion, is, that the bony
elevation alluded to never bears any relation to the di-
mensionsor extentofthe sinuses. Eithermay exist without
the other; and where the sinus has been found wanting,

51
the extemai swface has been perfectly smooth, and without
any pn>tubenmees indicative of cerebral developnsent.
· Dr Spurzheim has next aseerted that the frontal sinuses
are generally \venting in children, young penons, and
adults, and that they oocur only in old pel'IODs, or aft.er
ehronic insanity.• The absence of the sinu&efl in young
and -
adnlt persons is, on the contrary, exceedingly rare: ao
much so,·as to ba\re escaped the observation of Palfin, Ber-
tin, Portal, Soemmering, Caldani, and other anatomists.t
Dr Monro mentions it as a remarkable fact, that, out of
fOrty-five skulls of adults cut open, he found three only
where the sinuses were wanting. t Out of the number
opened by Sir William Hamilton:, the poportion is still
Jess.
· Hen!, alto, it may again be reQlarked, that the convo-
lutions do not extend, so as to fill the angle formed by the
Union of the anterior plate of the frontal bone with its or-
lllitar plate ; ne-.erthelt'llS, over this cavity are situated the
organs of form, colour, order, number, &c. The same
objection applies to the organs ·at the base of the cerebrum,
and to a considerable portion of the cerebellum.
The external connguration of the .cranium appears,
therelore, to have no correspondence with the brain it en-
cloees. In mammiferous animals, which are moat favour-
able to such an opinion, as the skull is in them longer in a
cartilaginous and flexible state, the internal table receives

the impression of the brain ; yet, even here, the olfactory
and auditory ca~ities becoming interposed, the tables are
unequally separated from each other, and the whole con-
tour ofthe head is thereby visibly affected. This is parti-
cularly the cue with the elephant, hog, and buffalo. The
air-cells also of birds in general pervade the cranium, and
have a similar effect, which is especially exemplified·in the
ostrich, eagle, and owl.• In many reptiles, and in llODle
fish, the brain does not half fill the cavity of the skull, the
interspace being tilled with a watery or oily secretion.
· Neither in man nor in animals, therefore, is itpossible to
ascertain, during life, the relative positions and sizes of
those organs to which each of the .more favoured faculties
has been assigned " a local habitation and a name.''
Dr Spurzheim, in reply to these objections, has lately ob-
served, " We diJ Mtjudge by the pareicular eletJalicnu and

adrJeraariu are tAe bt1mpi818--but no-look at tAe general

this declaration it is impossible to comprehend; for, in the
same course, nay, in the same lecture, he p.roceeded to
demonstrate the individual bumpsandprotuberanceswhich,
in fact, constitute the system.

·living characters, even to the eighth of an inch? Bul
this is not all. In adverting to the custom which di£.
ferent ~tions have or compressing and otherwiee changing
the Corm of the head, Dr Spurzheim remarked, '~ The in-
'Strument that. is worn for this purpose bas been brought to
·England. I know oot exactly how long it is used, but
have heard about two years. It is curious, and worthy of
investigation ; and I would have you, should any of you

THE EVIDENCE OF ANATOMY.

in general, tenacious of their claims to originality ; they
are unwilling to believe that any of their views could,
by any possibility, have been anticipated; and resemble,

to meritfor having made certain discoveries which were weH
known in the time of Malpighi, is not a matter of the
aligbteat import ; nor is it here requisite toinstitute any in-
quiry into aome controversial points in the structure of the
brain, which, it ia ackno:wledged, have no neceaary con...
nection with the truth or falsehood of the phrenological
doctrine&
The most accurate and minute anatomical investigations
will alone not reveal to us the use of any organ ; yet the
study of anatomy is essential to the progress of physiology,
as a knowledge of the internal structure of an organ will
always tend considerably to elucidate aud confirm our opi:-
nions respecting the nature:of its functions. It, therefore,
remaiDS for us to enquire, Whether the anatomical re-
aearches of Drs Gall and Spurzheim have thrown any light
on Phrenology ?
The object of all their demonstrations is to prove that
the brain is composed of a number of fibres, • which arise

rebro, p. f., 1169.)-The cerebral convolutions are euppoeed by Dra Gall an~
Spunheim to be formed by two fibrous layers, !lightly agglutinated together
by the surrounding grey substance. The experiment to pro_

convolut.iona at the lide1 at :i>ell a1 in the middle; and the convolutions may
thus be divided into layers more or less numerous, and more or Jess thick, at
the pleasure of the demonstrator. Dr Spunhcim affirms that this separation
only takes place whm the stream ia directed on the middle line. " I ban
.never," aays Dr Gordon,·" experienced more difficulty in separating the Ja.
minaoJ at the sides from each other than th~ in the middle; and supposing
the contrary to have been the cue, it would only have tended to shew that the
lamine in the middle adhere to each other less firmly than at the aide, wfiidi
is the opinion actually entertained by Reil." (Obs. on the Structure of the
Brain, 143.)-Tenon, Portal, Sabatier, Pine!, and Cuvier, witneaed Dr
Spurzheim perform this experiment; and, in a similar manner, they report
that, admitting the fact, it only proves " that there is leas cohesion in the

~ons of both hemispheres, they are, by the co.operation
of the fibres of the corpus callosum, brought into commu.
nication, and find, as it were, a centre of union in the oo-
miasurcs.•
. The presumptive evidence that ia afforded by these ana-
tomical views is strikingly at variance with the phrenologi-
cal hypothesis. It is, indeed, impossible to cpoceive any
atructure more illustrative of the unity of.the brain's ac..
tion. lo every part we trace a continuity of the same ma-
terial substance, forming clearly a single organ ; neverthe-
less, by a remarkable perversion ofjudgment, it is insisted
that this continuous structure is a congeries of no less than
r.birty-five organs, the limits of not one of which can be as.,.
certained. This proposition, albeit unsupported by the
slightest vestige of proof, is invariably taken for grant-
~. It is the aJ,pha and omega of the whole phrenologi-
¢al creed, and the petitio princi.pii, on which all their
reasonings depend. " It ia certain," says Dr Spurz-
heim, " that tire brain oonaists efa multiplicity efinstru-
ments performing particu'/ar functions." Yet, on what
does the certainty of this conclusion rest ? How has it
been proved ? Where dcmoolilrated ? Had it been as-
serted that every separate bundle of fibres, or each convo-

equally hypothetical, would have been, to a certain extent,
more plausible; but, .even then, no reaon ct>uld havebeetl
adduced to shew why every part ofthe brain might not still
be essential to the performance of all its healthy functioos,
as every part of the eye or ear has a reference to the sense
of vision, or of hearing.
The physiological speculations of Drs Gall and Spun-
heim are absolutely opposed, therefore, to their own ana-
tomical demonstrations: for by what circuirous mode of
~iog ia it that we are to conclude that the very stroe-
ture, which is proved to be, in every pert, continuous, is
nevertheless a congeries of organs? Is not this inferenct,
in every respect, contrary to the evidence before us ? Had

The proximate cauw of this instinct hae, by some writ-

others, to its experience ; yet neither.of these explanations
will sufficientIy account for itsphenomena. However striking
be the adaptation ofan &88emblage ofinstrumentstoperform

ture of an animal alone give rise to its peculiar habits, all
I

its actions would be invariable, and preserve the same,uni-
formity; nor would it, in any case, vary its mode of action
to suit the con~ingencies of external circu~stances. The
same bird, urged by the same blind mechanical impulse,
would, under every condition, build her nest in a similar
mann~, without being in6uenced by the peculiar ~xigen­
cies of time and place. Yet we have many examples to the
contrary.
The sparrow, when building on a tree, always constructs
a covering for her nes4 for the sake of protection ; yet
never has recourse to this contrivance when building under
a 13bed or roof. The beavers, when they settle by the side
of a running stream, always erect a strong pier, ·or dam-
dyke, to preserve th~ water.at the same height ; .yet they
never think of this operation when they meet at the brink
of a lake. 'l'be actions of many animals have also a rela-
tion to.future exigencies, which is quite inexplicable on this
hypothesis. Many birds remain for weeks together upon
their nests, and, when they leave them, with provident
care cover their eggs, to keep them warm, and conceal
t,hem from danger. The magpie, knowing her eggs are
the food of many birds of prey, covers her nest carefully,
leaving only a sufficient space at the side, to get out and in
at. .Rabbits, and some other mammiferous animals, whose
young are born blind, as a protection, cover the holes
wherein they lie concealed.
Nor will the experience of the animal alone explain
these phenomena, as it is certain they perform many actions
that are independent of all acquired·knowledge. The.in-
~tinctive. perc;eption 'fhich enabl~s the young partridge, al-

moet as soon as it ciomes from the shell, to run about,
without injuring itself, among the long grass and corn,
and the young grouse among the rough heather :-the
skill and delicacy with which the uninformed swallow con-
structs her nest, and the gossamer spider its web, proves
incontestably a knowledge independent of that long chain
of reasoning which Berkeley refers to, as the cause of all
our acquired perceptions of the situations and relative dis-
tances of objects.
While, therefore, neither the organization of the animal
nor its individual experience, will alone explain the source
of instinct, both these contingencies have doubtless a consi-
derable influence in determining and modifying its mani-
festations ; yet, to decide how far they may have open1ted
in affecting the habits and propensities of different animals,
we must venture in.to a wide field of speculation which has
hitherto not been explored.
DrsGall and Spurzheim have,indeed,proposed to examine
the structure of the brain and nervous system, ascending
from the simplest animals up to man. But what have they
in reality effected ? They have hitherto merely described
the nerves of the caterpillar, the brain and spinal marrow
of the chick, and some few mammiferous animals; yet.even
their work on these subjects, on the authority of Cuvier,
Tiedmann, and other .distinguished anatomists, is not ex-
empt from errors. No very extensive view of the animal
kingdom is, indeed, necessary to discover facts that are
opposed to their conclusions, and to perceive that they
have adopted a very unsatisfactory and partial mode of in-
duction.

II. The organ of Philoprogenitivenesa is next represent-
ed as giving rise to parental attachment ; but, on inquiry,
it will be found that the energy of this benevolent feeling
depends on moral, rather than on physical causes. In the ear-
ly hi&tory of nations, when the habits, manners, and laws
of a people, partake of the rude and barbarous spirit of the
times, we find the exercise of this faculty, so far from
being the necessary result of any organic constitution, &0
completely abolished, that we can scarcely recognize even
its existence.
The Phenicians and Carthaginians were, by their my-
thological creed, induced frequently to sacrifice their in-
fants to the gods. The latter had a law which decreed
~hat four children of noble birth should be regularly im-
molated on the altars of Saturn.• History records a me..
lancholy instance of this superstition and cruelty. It is
related they attributed their defeat by Agathocles king of
Sicily to the omission of these sacrifices ; and, in order to
atone for the past negligence, offered up at one time two
hundred of the sons of the nobility.
In some of the Greci~ states infanticide was not only
tolerated but enforced by law. The Spartan legislator ex-
pressly ordained that every child that was born should be
examined, and if found weak or deformed, thrown into a
deep cavern at the foot ofMount Taygetus, called .Apothe-
t<e, " concluding that its life could be of no advantage ei-

ther to itself or to the public, since nature bad not given
it at first any strength or goodness ofconstitution."• The
mild Plato even justifies this practice, and directs, in his
republic, that "all children born with any deformity shall
be removed and concealed in some obscure retreat."t
This barbarous custom was coeval with Rome. It was
authorized by Romulus,t sanctioned.by the law of the
~welveTables,11 and continued until the timeofConstantine
the Great, after which it was exploded by the mild spirit
of Christianity.
The Hindoos, from the earliest peryod, have bad recourse
to this apalling crime. 'fhe Greek and Roman historians
,
noticed it, and referred to the places where they practised
it. Dr Buchanan·states that the number of infantile mur-
ders in the provinces of Cutch and Guzerat alone amount-
ed, according to the lowest calculation in 1807, to 3000
annually; and, by another computation, to 30,000.§ Mr
Duncan, the governor of Bombay, informs us that a sect of
Hindoos was discovered in 1789, who were in t.be habit of
putting to death all their female infants, the mother caus-
ing them to be starved. This sect, called the Rqjekoo-
·mars, lived on the frontiers of Juanpore, a district of the
province of Benares, adjoining to the countr! of Oude.

ditliculty which they find in supporting their families,
and the low and degraded state in which, at such pe-
riods, women are generally held. Hence the Hindoos, in
expiation of infanticide, urge the trouble they have in rear-
ing their female children, and the improbability of their
afterwards being married.• " I wish to God," said a poor
Oroonoka woman, when reproved for this crime; "father,

In all oountries where infanticide is.coanJloo~ women are
literally slaves. ·The Giaga women reap, 11<>w, cut w~
toil in the fields and forests, whµe their husband1 remain
aupinely and indolently at home. The Hottentot young
men are admitted into the company of. their seniors at the
age of eighteen, after which it is considered disgraceful to
Jceep company with women. Dr Barrow describes a race
of theae people called Bqjumam, who, when oppressed. by
hunger, or obliged to fly from the Boors, without any he.
sitation strangle their children, cast them away in th~ de.
aerta, or bury them alive.• In China, women are bartered
for, as slaves, and kept constantly under lock and key.
They have been notorious for infanticide. The late Sir
George Staunton estimated the yearly amount of infantile
exposures in the city of Pekin alone at flOOO, Mr:Barrow
at 9000, and many of the missionaries still higher.
The practice that prevailed in Greece and Rome of men
purchasing their wives, and lending them out afterWards
among their friends, must necessarily have tended to di..
minish.the attachment of a mother towards her children;
far the influence of tyranny, like the pestilentodour.of the
upas tree, never fails to lay waste and destroy every gene-
:rous ~eeJing within its reach. As nations, however, p

ootobvious that the ·relation ol a father towards ·his child
is of a fess intimate and endeering kind than that of the
mother ? He has no reminisoence of the long and anxious
·sufferings that have been endured for its sake; he feels not
that the· vital 60urce of its nourishment is dependent up0n
him ; he mingles with the stir and bustle of the busy
world, and his thoughts are cootinually engaged by.other
cares; whilst the mother, brooding in solitude over ha
infant, . cheri&hei the perpetual oonseiousness of having
ushettd it into existence; she alone feels sensible that ita
feeble life is still dependent upon her support, and day and
·
.night ministei's, with all the tenderest solicitude oi love, to
·supply its little wants and neceasitiea. But, it will be aaed,
are there.no examples among us to the contrary? none of
Google
76
matemal heartlessness? none even ofinfanticide? Itmust
be acknowledged there aresome melancholy instances on re-
cord, in which the unfortunate mother, from a sense of her
own frailty, and the fear of public ignominy, has.been led,
.in the delirium of her sin, to uplift her hand against the
life of her own child. · The apprehension of exposure, the
dread of persecution, above all, the trembling hope that
she may yet save herself from dishonour, would appear, on
1uch occasions, to raise a terrible conflict, in which reason
itself grows bewildered, or only conjures up some new and
more hideous phantom of alarm, urging the perpetmtion
of this revolting crime. Many are the moral causes, there-
, fore, which manifestly excite, diminish, or even obliterate
for a time feelings of parental attachment ; nor has any
evidence been hitherto brought forward to authorize us to
attribute the manifestations of this faculty simply to the
increased activity of a certain isolated,portion of the brain.
Throughout the animal kingdom the attachment of eve-
ry female animal ef the same species to her young is al-
ways uniform ; whatever variety may exist in the form or
size of the head, each will defend her young with the
same savage intrepidity ; nor does the feeling appear to be
at all affected or modified by any difference of cerebral
development.
The ingenuity which some animals exhibit in defraud-
ing the stranger from the place of their young, affords an
additional argument in favour of the opinion, that instinct
cannot be regarded merely as a blind impulse, resulting
from the organic constitution of the animal. When the
hind bears the bounds,. she puts herself in the way of being
Google
71
hunted, and leads them from her fawn. The partridge,
wild duck, ringed plover, and arctic gull, drop a wing, and
feign lameness, enticing the obtruder to follow them, and
leave their young in safety. The lapwing is not less·in-
genious: when a person approaches, she flies about, always
retiring from her nest. Actions of this kind, suggested
clearly by the exigency of the moment, and varied accord-
ingly, can never be considered as the result merely of a me-
chanical cause, the effects ofwhich would, in every case, be
nearly similar, without any reference to the differences and .
peculiarities of contingent circumstances.
The law appears to bold universally throughout the ani-
mal kingdom, that when the young animal is able to pro-
tect itself, the end of parental attachment being accom-
plished, the bond of union is dissolved. When the young
tigers can support themselves, they leave the jungle of the
tigress ; and when the young eagles can secure their own
prey, they are driven from the eyrie. This fact is strik-
ing!y opposed to the phrenological theory ; for how hap.
pens it that the organ from whence this feeling was deriv-
ed all of a sudden, as if by an inexplicable caprice, ceases
to continue its activity ? Again, it may be argued, that
all animals possessing the organ of philoprogenitivenesa
should be endowed with the memmy attributed to it; yet,
in no instance does the parent animal ever afterwards re.
cognise her young.
III. The organ of lnhabitiveness is the next which
_
claims our attention, being highly characteristic of the spe-
culative genius of the phrenologists, who have, with the
Google
78
most aingular acumen," been enabled to determine exactly
what are the primitive faculties of the.mind, and have~
gislated on their several capabilities and varieties, with as
much confidence a8 if they had been a_dmitted prime mi~
nisters into the cabinet councils of nature, and were per..
fectly conversan·t with all her most secret operations.
.As ev"
ery flower and herb is' indigenous to acertain soil
and climate, so every animal is the inhabitant of some par~
ticularcountry, "
axid pursues that mode of life for which, by
its general structurE.", it is visibly destined. The bear and
the wolf would not live in the climate of the lion ; nor doe9
the rein-deer thrive when transponed from its snowy ·re-
gions into the sunriy valleys of thesouth. ·Certain animali,
from the peculiarity of their conformation, are indisposed
to mu.ch activity, and, like the sloth, move heavily along;
or remain for a considerable period in a state of indoleDCe
and repose. Others, on the contrary, having the extremi-
ties light and flexible, are seen, like the wild goat or ·ante..
lope, bounding playfully along the sides Of the steepest
rocks. Sc>1ne, as the deer or sheep, browse quietly ia
the fertile vale; others, like the pacos, live only on the
tops of the highest mountains. .There are. some birds
which, like the dodo, from their general structure,·are In-
capable of flying; whilst others, like the eagle, rise very
high into the heavens. Such habits result unquestiOnably
from the genertil organization of the animal. It is, for ex-
ample, remarked, that birds which live on earth, as our do-
mestic birds, and those which climb trees, have the poste-
rior enlargement of the spinal marrow much greater thaa
the anterior; whilst those which fly in the air, and mf..
Google
79
grate,. present an inverse· arrangement.• But the struc-
ture of the brain or spinal marrow al.one would' not lead
animals to adopt these peculiar habits: we must always
look to their general conformation. Thus, the chamois,
the inhabitant of the Alps and Pyrennees, is, by the
light·and tendinous .structure of its limbs, peculiarly and
visibly destined to ascend and descend the steepest and
utost difficult rocky paths ; and there is every reason to
believe, that animals preferring the summits of the highest
mountains are led to do so from the difference of climate
which is, in such places, more congenial to them. Hence
~e are informed, that the pacos, which seem to require a
more purified and rarified air than is found even on the
tops of our highest mountains, never thrive if confined to
the valley, and invariably die when transported into a warm
climate. ·
The phrenologists, in their theorizing mapia, conceive
that no bird can ri~ into the air, nor any animal a6cend
a few yards up a mountain, without being endowed with
a peculiar cerebral structure, disposing it to seJf-eleva-
tjon. Yet we kuow some birds of the same kind adopt
thus far very opposite habits, without it being possible to
discover the supposed difference in the conformation of the
brain. The sky-lark, for instance, mounts high into the
heavens, and pours forth its " stream of song," from a
height that is dazzling to the naked eye ; whilst, on the
other hand, the tit-lark perches on the branches of the
• Lawrence's Blumembach, 2.51.
Google
80
hedge-row, and the ground-lark rests upon the green-
sward. Again, the golden eagle builds her nest on the
inaccessible summits of the loftiest cliff's, sometimes shel-
tered behind a jutting crag, often exposed to the wi~d,
rain, and all the changes of the inclement weather. The
sea-eagle, on the contrary, living chiefly on fish, invariably
builds her nest down upon the sea..shore. Were even the
possibility of the existence of such a pre-determinate facul-
ty as that under consideration, for a single moment to be
admitted, there would be no end to the phrenological spe-
culations. Thus one organ would lead the bat tofrequent
ruinous cathedrals and towers ; another of a different kind,
the owl, to the gloomy precincts of the church-yard; and
another, the ostrich, into his wild and solitary deserts.
Like the sage and immortal Martinus Scriblerus, the
phrenologists appear to have been wandering in search of
the sublime when they discovered this organ ; but as there
is only one step between the sublime and the ludicrous,
urged by an untoward phrenological impulse, they have,
it would seem, unfortunately overstept the fatal boun-
dary. Some opinions, indeed, may be maintained, that
are so absolutely ridiculous, that they deserve no se-
rious attention; and be who would begin gravely to con-
trovert them would only resemble Smollett's honest pe-
dant, who sat down to prove, by mathematical demon-
stration, that it was wrong to do evil, and was laughed
at for· his pains. Thus, when Dr Spurzheim tells us
seriously that " ane set·ef rats, [JOSSessing this organ,
morent into corn-lo.JU; and others, possessingit not, descend

81
inlo cellara.~ When he assures us this primitive feeling is
first manifested by leading little " children to climb up on
chair1, in order to be cm a keel, with adJul.tper.tom',"f there
is something in the supposition alone so exceedingly ludi-
crous, t~1at its nonsense and absurdity can be aggravated
only by the gravity with which it would doubtless be
defended within the walls of the Phrenological Society. .
IV. The organ of Destructiveness, originally termed
thatof" murder,"is considered by the phrenologists·as haV'-
ing been completely established ; yet the manifestations of
the feelings attributed to .this faculty wil1 invariably be
found to result from those external circumstances and mo-
nl causes, which alone appear to determine all the darker,
as well as the brighter, traits of the human character.
With every nation the effects of climate, and force of
example, are remarkable; hence the inhabitants ofnorthem
countries have been represented to possess more apathy and
indift'erence than those in more southern regions. A tribe
of northern Indians has been described, who view, with the
most perfect complacency, scenes of the grea~t distreM,
and even find an enjoyment in witnessing such spectacle1.
" I have been present," says Hearne, '' when one of them
would imitate the groans, distorted features, and contracted.
, positions of a man who had died in the moat excruciating
pain, and put the whole company except myself into the
moat violent fit of laughter." t .Even women in these re..

as being the princ~pal oonstituents oftheir natural character.
''ID this territory," continues the same traveller, " they
desire their husbands and friends to bring them home the
prisoners taken in war, that they may themselves enjoy·the
savage ·pleasure of putting them to death."• ·
With many tri~s revenge is made a favourite and cherish-
ed passion, and its indulgence forms the leading feature of
their character. Among the Kookies, or Lunctas, it is cus-.
tomary, if one of their number be killed, by falling from a
tree,'for the rest to assemble, ·and cut it down ; and, what-
ever be its size, convert it into chips, which ·they scatter to
the wind.t If one ofthem become the prey of a tiger, the
whole tribe is up in arms; and the family of the deceased
remains in disgrace until, by destroying the animal, they
can give afeast of its flesh.! There are many entire tribes
on the western coast of Africa, with whom it is an avowed
maxim "neve~ to forgive or let an injury go unrevenged,"
alledging that "'the'forgiveness of injuries is incompatible
with the nature of man."11 The duty of vengeance is held
to be imperative among the North American Indians. The
illstance is related by a traveller of a young Chactaw, who,
having been reproved by his mother, " took so ill as, in
the fury of his shame, to resolve on his own death."· He

.Circassians, a similar principle prevails. When oQe man
· ~s been killed by another, the relatives of the deceased
consider it necessary to avenge his death by the blood of
the murderer, which they conceive can alone give rest to
.bis and their own souls.t The superstitious notions and
habits of such people, without any reference to the pecu-
-liarities of _
cerebral development, invariably give rise to
and determine their individual dispositions: and a.s nationa,
therefore, emerge from a state of barbarity, different cir:-

ings and principles ofan opposite description, and produce
in every respect a striking revolution of character. .Thus

The.organ of destructiveness was originally discovered,
by the phrenologists noticing the difference that exists be..
tween the skulls of carnivorous and herbivorous animals ;
for as the former, it is argued, exhibit greaterferociay than
the latter, and prey on living animals, so they must be ex.
cited by an internal propensity to destroy ; whereas herbi.
vorous animals, browsing quietly on grass and herbs, are
more gentle and docile, and manifest not this fatal propen..
sity.• Now, the fallacy of this reasoning is very obvious.

fumiabed with long pointed teeth, and strong, curved, and
sharp claws, enabling them to seize and lacerate their food ;
they possess great muscular strength in the jaws, neck, and
limbs; and have a short alimentary canal, visibly destined for
the reception and quick passage only of animal substances.
Herbivorous animals present, on the contrary, an op~te
structure : their teeth are flattened at the surfaces; they
have no claws, less muscular strength, and·a stomach of.a
peculiar and complicated mechanism, adapted to the double
process of mastication. The general and pE'Cllliar struc-
ture of the two species of animals, renders a dift'erent mode
of life essentially necessary to each.
What is meant by the destructive propensity of a carni-
vorous animal? He is, by hunger, instigated to seek, tear,
and devour the prey, on which alone he can subsiat.
Urged by this instinct, the wolf, who is said to be naturally
a coward,becomes courageous from necessity, and will even
attack the buffalo and animals he would otherwise avoid.
The bear having gorged himselfwith food, retires with his
hide distended, and passes the greater part of the winter in
a state ofabstinenceand repose; when again, however, wast-
ed away, he piowJs abroad, a mere skeleton, and the sa..

vageness of his disposition is always proportionate to the
inconvenience he may be enduring. Thus caniivorous a1*
mals are urged by an instinctive power to seek and destroy
whatever may be necessary for their support, whilst a si-
milar principle actuates equally the herbivorous animal.
The sheep, thegoat, the deer, the camel, tear down fence.,
destroy grass, herbs, foliage, &c. and manifest preciseIy the
same faculty of destructiveness, in order to gratify their
wants and desires. The same propensity that prompts
th~ lion to spring upon his prey, or the tiger to plunge his
head into the body of an. animal,-the same instinctive
power that guides the vulture to the field of slaughter, and
the jackall to the grave,-leads the antelope to the moun.
tain-herb which be prefers, the plover to the corn-field,
and the humming-bird to the flower from whence, with its
~lender bill, it extracts the nectar on which it lives.
Nor is the analogy in other respects correct. Carnivorous
,animals prey on otheranimals, yet never, in their wild state,
on the individuals of their own species; whilst the excessive
activity of this unfortunate organ urges mankind invariably
tO murderone another. Its manifestations in the human spe-

'l'HE EVIDENCE OF FACTS.
W HENEVE& the phrenologists find themselv.es in danget
of being defeated by a philosophical argument, they inva..
riably change their positions, and, retreating from the field
of rational controversy, appeal, with empirical dogmatism,
to the testimony of their facts. Overlooking for a time
the insuperable difficulties that beset the theory, let ua
meet them on these grounds; and, first, we are entitled to
enquire, whether a sufficient number of facts have been
brought forward to establish the system ?
The doctrines of Phrenology have been before the world
upwards of thirty years, and, during that period, its pro-
mulgators have been unremitting in their exertions to pro-
cure all the -:vidence they could possibly collect, in support
of their view11. In 1796, Dr Gall commenced lecturing at
Vienna, and continued his demonstrations there for five
·years. He was then joined by Dr Spurzheim ; and, in
1800, they set out upon their travels to pursue their r~
searches together.· They were now seen travelling over a
va.St tract of country, from town to town, from village to
village; visiting public schools, prisons, hospitals, and
madhouses,-zealous, assidious, and perseveringin the pur-
suit of their anticipated " new discoveries." Considering
the variety and extent of their opportunities, bow many
facts ought they by this time to have accumulated ! How
long a ca~ogue of them should at present be on r~rd !
Instead of this, on examining th~r works, we find page
after page replete with glimmering metaphysical specula-
:w
Google
tions; argument succeeding argument on the existence and
the subdiv~sion of occult faculties and primitive feelings;
tedious, long, and frequently incorrect, anatomical descrip-
tions ; the whole interspersed· with ·the observations they
made, and the anecdotes they met with, which induced
them to determine the exact situations of the several organs.
tl'hey have given us no account of having taken, as the
Edinburgh phrenologists have done, the measurements ol
the organs of different individuals, to compare them with
their ascertained characters: they inform us only of having
noticed, in a few cases, certain cranial enlargements, or confi-
gurations of the head, which induced them to assign to
those parts the faculties in question; and no cases in addi-
tion are recorded to confirm the truth or falsehood of their
conclusions.
Viewing Phrenology simply a.' a " scie11ce effacts,'" it is
quite obvious, that the facts, which indeed constitute its very
existence, should be numerous, striking, and unequivocal:
they should not be "few and far between," with ever and
anon a confusion and doubt as to theif identity ; they
ahould form a strong and irresistible body of evidence, suffi-
cient to silence the objections of the most scrupulous of scep-
tics. The doctrines of Phrenology having been for many
years industriously promulgated, in 18~, ·ai:c gentlemen ·

grest outcry that bas been raised of the many evidences in
favour of Pbrenology,-notwithstanding the zeal of its ad-
vocate. and their united perseveraoce,-they have, in this
country, only been enabled to concentrate, within the pages
of their leading works, trDmty..eight facts in support of
their thirty-five organs.•
Even these being aekcted partially, and measured only
by the phrenologists themselves, cannot be admitted, as
strictly speaking, impartial evidence. Why do they
not have recourse to a more extensive manipulation?
One half the reports alluded to are of murderers, and the
majority of them invalidated by the following simple fact.
-When the criminal has been executed, the body is cut
down, and thrown upon its back ; the uocoagulated blood
then distends the muscles of the back, neck, and the pos-

large; whereas, were the body thrown upon its face, they
would be as unequivocally small. In addition to this, we
shall find that the same phrenological report will admit of
any interpretation, and apply·to almost-every variety of.cha- ._,;
acter. In the Table opposite, I have contrasted the develoi>/- U
mentsof 'l'hurtell, Haggart, and Pallet, with those ofMiss
Clara Fisher, a child of eight years of age, Raphael,
Sheridan, and Voltaire.
When the organs of acqui.titiveness, secretiveness, com-
bativeness, and destructiveness are large, they are supposed
to indicate the disposition of a thief and murderer; but
their activity may be restrained by the counteracting
influence of the organs of benewknce, and ronacientimu-
mu. On referring to the Table, it will be seen that
Sheridan was as good a murderer as Pallet, in as much
as, while they are both alike deficient in' benevolence
and consc.ientiousness, that excellent Dramatist possesses
the organ of destructiveness as large as Pallet, and that
of combativeness larger.
Voltaire, it will also be seen by the phrenological
indications, was a better murderer than Pallet, Hag-
gart, or Thurtell. Pallet has the organs of combative..
ness and destructiveness large ; in Voltaire they are
very large ; in benevolence and conscientousness both are
deficient. ·
Voltaire should also have excelled Haggart as a thief.
Both have secretiveness very large ; but Haggart has
acqusitiveness only mcderote, whilst, in Voltaire, ii is large.
The philosopher of Femey should also have been a more
atrocious murderer, because his organ of destructiveness is
Google
'larger, and he hu the organ of benevolence leas developed
than Haggart.
Again, it is really impossible to look at the develop-
ment of Thurtell, and seriously believe he murdered
Weare; the poor man must surely have been innocent,
and executed. by mistake; for he possesses the organ of
adheaiveneBS, which disposes to " fervour and constancy
ef a:ffecticn" very large, (and it is unlikely, with such
a development, be would ha~e murdered his friend,)
that of veneration, which gives rise ·to " religioua senti.
ments," and " respect and deference to persons,"• 'large,
and benevolence, (the source of every generous feeling,)
very 'large. How is it possible, therefore, to reconcile
these indications with his real character? ~he difficulty
is solved by the phrenological report, which shall speak for
itself. " The murder committe<l by Thurtell was a pre-
determined cold-blooded deed; nothing can justify it. Re-
venge against Weare for having gambled too succes&-
fully, and, as he imagined, unfairly with him, prompted it;
but there is e'Very probahility that Thurtell laid the unwar-
rantabk uncti<m to his soul, that he 'WOUid do a ser'Cice to
other1 by destroyi11g Weare. He considered Weare a1 a
complete rMctil, one who had robbed many aa weU as laim-
aeif, and one who, ifhe livtd, wauld have robbed many
'fTWre :"t thus the organ of benevolence is made to excite
the organ of murder; and the phrenological deduction is

chararleristic of all the beauty, excellence, and purity a(
its philo5ophy !
By·this Table it will also be observed that Voltaire should
b:ive been a more atrocious murderer than Thurtell, because
Voltaire has the organs of combativeness, secretiveness, and
destructiveness, all fJery 'large, and is deficient in·the moral
sentiments of benevolence and conscientousness, .which
Tburtell possesses in a higher degree, 10 that Voltaire, in
point of fact, had less to restrain him from committing mur-
der than Thurtell, who, it would appear, ought to have
been a mild, benevolent, and religious character.
The histrionic abilities of the celebrated Miss Clara
Fisher, are next considered to be ~tisfactorily indicated by (/)
the organs of ccmcentrativeness, secreti'Oeneaa, imitation,
and ideality ; whilst the other organs of the system are
supposed to exert, whenever it is necessary, their co-operat-
ing pow.er. Haggart and Pallet, it will be seen, might
have worn the buskin, and been an ornament to the Bri-
tish stage. Both possess the organ ofCOl}Centrativeness larg-
er than Miss Clara Fisher; both equal her in secretiveness
and imitation; and all three are deficient in that ideality,
which, we are informed, " adds splendour to the perform-
ance.'' Thurtell, however, possesses this latter organ in the
same degree that she does, and the majority of the other or-
gans concerned larger; so that, in early youth, he should
hne shone a Roscius, or, in more advanced life, a Kem-
ble.
The abilities of Raphael are referred to the develop-
ment of com;tructiveness, form, size, and imitation, which
were, it is said, the " whole elements of his future great-
Google
96
ness."• Now, the organs of constructiveness, form, md
imitation, are all in Haggart reported to be 1'1.rge and
.and.foll, and size is moderately developed; whilst, in .Pal-
let, the latter is full, and the others referred to all of good-
ly dimensions; so that Nature probably designed the one
for a Michael Angelo, and the other for a Salvator Rosa.
Miss Clara Fisher, were it inconvenient to notice the or-
gans of combativeness and destructiveness, (and it would
be ungallant to compare her development,.in every r~t,
with that of the evil company she has met with in the
Phrenological Journal,) might be shown to approach very
nearly to the genius of Raphael ; so that the phrenological
report of the few facts that' are on record may very clear-
ly be made to correspond with almost any character.
The most expert. phrenologists have not, however, al-
ways been so fortunate as to return such an account of the
developments as will, Jike the above, admit of any expla-
nation; they have occassionally announced indications of
character precisely the reverse of those manifested by the
individual. Thus Voltaire, who, in France, rearet;I the
standard of infidelity on the ruins of every moral and reli-
gious principle, possessed a 'large organ of veneration;t

Voltaire did not bow to hia 1uperiora, either in rank or wealth ; anll wu,

In the Edinburgh· Museu~ is the skull of a' Malay, a·
native of the Bali Islands, who was a notorious robber and
murderer. His head will be found .to indicate, by the de-·
velopment of thephrenological organs, that he was a good,
an intellectual, and a benevolent man. The skull will be
f~mnd of a greater capacity in size than are the crania of
~ny Europeans with which it may be compared. The
organs of combativeness, destructiveness, secretiveness,.&c.
are comparatively small, and the intellectual organs, abso-
lutely and relatively, very large. Sir William Hamilton
contrasted the phrenological measurement of this skull with
that of the celebrated Buchanan, by which it is seen that
the Bali murderer, who was executed for killing his wife,
by sawing oft' her head, possessed the organs of veneration,
benevolence, &c. in a higher degree than Buchanan, and
those disposing to combativeness and destructiveness in a
less degree ; whilst, on the other hand, Buchanan, one of
the most intellectual characters Scotland has produced, has
all the intellectual organs less fully developed than they
are found in the Bali robber. So far as it goes, this com-
niah anything from his reputation. As weU might it be argued, that
Gray waa no poet, because he composed with hesitation and labour ; but
we have, in Moore's life, the testimony ofFox, that Sheridan waa one of the
wittiest of his contemporaries, (m1 the Life of Sheridan,·chap. Ti. p. 211,)
a paaaage passed o•er in silence by the candid spirit of the phrenologiats,
who insinuate that all Sheridan's wit depended entirely on the excellence of
his tMniory; yet, :were this to have been the case, the difficulty, ao far
aa Phrenology is concerned, would only be aggravated, because the memory
of wit ia euppoeed to be dependeni on the very organ which is ao deficient

pariaon affords a very triumphant refutation of Phrenolo-
gy; and the authenticity of both skulls, and the atrociom:
character of the Bali murderer, is, I undentand, sufficient-
ly asce~ned.•
·· Considering Phrenology merely as a doctrine of chancee·
apd contingencies, we know that those cranial enlargements·
which are termed organs are found invariably in almost:
every human head ; and all the propensities, sentime?ts,
and.intellectual faculties ascribed to them, are the common·
and natural att1ibutes ofevery man; so that, while tbere·are
few skulls without such prominences and signs, there are
still fewer individuals who do not possess, in a higher or
Ie8s degree, some of the mental endowments, which aresup-
posed to result from their activity. The chances are there:
fore always in favour of the phrenologist-finding, that the
individual who manifests a certain number of those facul-
ties will have, at any rate, some of the developments, or
signs, to correspond. In other words:-" Supposing there
was but one eminence on a given cranium, and the phreno-
logist had to infer, from a knowledge of the faculties, the

an indication, which chance is greater in proportion to the
frequency of theeminence, and maybe expressed by a fr.-ao-

Bod they may be reducoo.in.to the following aote-phreoo-
logical propositions.
1.-0n examining the brain itself, no evidence whatever
is found to exist in favour of its being supposed a mugeries
of organs; ·its structure, on the contrary, is everywhere con-
tinuous, and strikingly illustrative of the unity of itsaction.
II.-The form, size, and extent of the supposed organs
are determined by no appearances indicating the limits of.
their individual expansions: the division of the brain is ar-
bitrary and unfounded ; nor could the phrenologists, were
the organs dissected out and set apart from one another,
recognise them individually by any characteristic distinc-
tions.•
111.-No pathological evidences, from cases of partial
insanity, can be adduced in favour of Phrenology.t After
the most complete state of mental derangement, the ablest
pathologist has been unable to detect any morbid appear-
ances in the brain ; and when such have been presented, no
relation has been found to exist between the aberration of
a certain faculty, and any peculiar condition of that part of
the brain to which it is ascriqed.t

IV.-The brain attains- its full complement in size hefi>re
the evolution of the mental faculties, so that the powers of
the mind cannot be considered to be evolved by the gradu-
al enlargement and development of the cerebra'·substance.•
V.-The size of the brain, by whaw.rer standard it be
estimated, is not indicative of any superior or inferior
degree of intelligence, or mental ability ;t and the law
which applies to this organ as a whole, will apply to it
equally in all its individual parts.t
VI.-The four temperaments, which, it is alleged, form
panied with what they term " diatlaaed action" of the organ to which it ia
referred. Thus, ])T Spunheim states, that he once saw a man witneu
the death of his own child, by its being accidentally drowned, whereupon
he immediately applied his hand to the organ of philoprogenitiveneu,
which suffered pain I In support of this proposition, however, I might
accumulate the authorities of Morgagni, Dr Greding, (who made no leM
than 216 dissections of maniacal patients,) Pine!, Haslam, Meckel, and a
number of other eminent authors who have puraued with peculiar ardour
this investigation.

VIII.-The phrenologists have not so far extended their
researches into the inferior animal creation as to warrant
their drawing any analogies or inferences in favour of their
theory. Hitherto they have made but few investigations,
and their inductions from those are very limited and partial.

delicate organization, which, from itspeculiarstructure and
activity, gave rise to perception, memory, and judgment,
falls into decay, the mind, it must be presumed, will in-·
evitably perish with it, and sink into the blank and
dreary void of hopelesa annihilation.•
How can the pernicious consequences of these doc~
trinea be better illustrated than by the fact, that the
phrenologists themselves, in the blindness of their credu-

PREFACE.
From the time Phrenologywasfirst made known
to the Author, he has repeatedly endeavoured to
d~over whether it were built upon thatsure foun·
dation, which should induce him to adopt and
advocate it ; but the more he examined, the
more he felt convinced of its fallacy, and con·
scientiouslybelieving that the diffusion and prac·
tical application of its principles will produce
consequences injurious to society, and quite con·
trary to what its promulgators anticipate, he has
not scrupled publiclyto avow himselfanopponent.
He does not expect to bring those over to his
opinion who are already strongly wedded to the
system, but he does hope to prevent others from
becoming converts to it.
To Phrenologists he would say, that having no
desire to impugn the purity of their motives, he
only requests them in return to give him credit
for equally good intenti~ns ; also to remark, that
as Dr. Spurzheim, when speaking ofthe apathy
which medical men shewed for the science, hoped
to be excused if any severe expressions should
escape him,• whilst endeavouring to convmce

them oftheir error; so the Author, in his endea-
vours to convince Phrenologists of theirs, looks
for a similar indulgence.
As it might appear strange to many, that no
notice has been taken in the following pages, of
a recent work, entitled " Evidences against the
System of Phrenology," the Author begs leave
to state, that his Manuscript was quite prepared
for publication prior to his having heard of it.
Hehas since perusedthe Evidenceswith pleasure,
and considers them to bear the impress of deep
research andgreattalent. Inthese, Mr. Stone has
fully detailed the his~ory ofthe science, in order
to prove that Drs. Gall and Spurzheim have
not any claim to its discovery ; a pointwhich the
Author.never contemplated as necessary, from
its not being essential to the main object of his
inquiry (namely) whether the doctrine be in.itself
true or false. If it shall be found to give the
true exposition of man's understanding, the Au-
thor's opposition cannot prevent its progress,
upon the principle, that "Magna est veritas et
prrevalebit, " on the contrary, if erroneous, he
trusts that his exertions will not have been alto-
gether fruitless.

ANTI-PHRENOLOGY.
The Philosophy Qf the human understanding
is now supposed to be broµght to an unpreceden•
ted degree of perfection, by a system which the
March of Intellect has prooqced·, and which
professes to teach all its intricate operations in
a superior manilei:'. To tlie aiscoverers of this
new light, the science of mind mtist.be almost a
"reading made easy,'' since they avow an inti·
mate acquaintance with all mental manifestations
and their respective organs, so as to·d~monstrate
unerringly where they severally reside within
the skull.-Perspic~ty, Precision, and.Truth are
said to characterize it; hence'we may presume
that it will soon claim a ninli among 'the exact
sciences.
This novel and in every respect singular doc·
.trine, received its ear~est publicity, in any
tangible and regular form, froni the pen of Dr.
Gall, a German, who named it Craniology ; but
.as this title could only confer a superficial char·
B
Coogle
acter, since it merely implied the skull or bony
covering, and not brain, which alone is the organ
of mind, it was deemed expedient to substitute
the word Phrenology, a term more justly expres-
siveof the desired object: but even this improve-
ment does not appear sufficiently comprehen-
sive, because its etymology bears no reference
whatever to the cranium or skull, which is un-
questionably the Phrenologist's mind-gauge, or
sole index of mental organs. I should therefore
say, with all due deference,(" et fas est ab hoste
doceri")that the compound·appellation of Cra;.
nio-phrenology was preferable to either, beca~
it embraces every instrument which the Artist
employs.
It is now fully before the Po.blic, and at the
optionof any individual to canvas~and serutinU:~,
advocate or oppose, as he may think proper; and
should a little freedom of animadversion be in-
dulged in, the Phrenologists must not forget
that they have delivered their opinions on all
Metaphysical writers who preceded them, with
no sparing hand.
Phrenology is a plant that bas not thriven
kindly on the Continent, although indigenous to
that soil, and an attempt is making to naturalize
itin this fertile c.Jountry, Scions ofwhich, spring-
ingfrom n:urseries,calledPhrenologiCal societies,
are thence propagated through the kingdom.
.John Bull has often perfected inventions that
Google
have been made by his·continental neighbours,
and probably he hopes in due time to elevate his
German discovery from a speculative to a prac-
.tic.al purpose. Should he succeed, all will be
.well, and he may have much reason to rejoice;
.ifnot, he has·only to disregard-the being ~ghed
·at for an excess of credulity, in fostering a delu-
.sive chimera. Some ofmy readers may coincide
with, others oppose thjs theory of the human
.mind, but I take it for granted that all are
desirous of discovering truth or error in any
branch ·of knowledge, and of wel~oming ·the
former from whatever source·it springs ;.(" the
flower 's divine where e'er it grows") and .there-
fore that they keep themselvesopentoconviction,
without any fear orshame ofpractising retracta-
. tion. At present I candidly· confess myself an
.opponent, being unable to admit the soundness
and truth of its doctrines ; but it does not follow
that because I oppose a question to day, I might
not upon good reasons advocate it tomorrow,
without meriting the name of a changeling.
With this open unprejudiced feeling, I purpose
·offering a few remarks upon the system, which
in my opinion has a tendency to operate in ex-
tremes; either by doing the gr~atest service or
. dis~ervice to mankind, according as it may prove
to be right or ·wrong:· and since, if fully recog·
nized; its operation could not be limited, hut
must ramjfy through every department ofsociety,

I am persuaaed that the ub~ost caution and
judgment should be exercised before so irdluen-
tial an agent obtains universal acceptance.
T~e Phrenologist does not, lilly·more thari the
·Metaphysician, attempt to explain tlie Essence
of our reasoning intellectual faculty. Both, in
the construction of their individual systems had
·an eye simplyto the manifestations·8f operation5
of mind ; but whilst the latter lias laboured tD
convince m~kind~ that these result from an unity
ofaction ofone entire Brain upon every external
object presented to it through the media of our
five Senses, and effected by some unknown
.hidden process ; the forriler has taken atotally
opposite view, contending for a perfect divisi-
bility of action, and asserting that the human
brain is composed of a determimite number of
distinct organs, ( thirty-five ) whfoli represent as
many faculties or powers ; and further that every
individual organ cari be pointed out and deline.
ated upon the outside of a· skull. The Meta.-
physician does not presume to say that his own
view admits of positive proof, but from certain
rational arguments, he esteems it the moSt
probable and 'correct; still he will not dogtnati-
cally affirin itsinfallibility. The Phrenologist's
language,on the contrary, possesseslittlecaution;
H boldly declares that his doctrine te~hes the
only true Philosopny of mind, for that under such
and such portions of the skull, such and such

organs are constantly seated. Dr. Spurzheim
says "'With respect to many individual parts I
have been certain of their functions for a .long
time, and I could challenge any one to bring me
an exception, but of someothers I will not speak
so d«:idedl,y•.,,
Had Phrenologists not delineated on the head
any other organs than what they knew.to acer.:
tainty, one might be only induced to think them
rather dogmatical, but when we find them depict-
ing as exactly, organs whose nature and even
existence are doubted, then we have a legitimate
right, to question and distrust the accuracy and
soundness of the whole science ; for surely it
evinces great imperfection to map out a brain
into so many distinct faculties, name them defi-
nitively' and then be uncertain as to the reality
ofma.ny. Whatshouldwe think ofa Geographer,
who, having clearly delineated the several places
of a newly discovered country, afterwards informs
us in his work, that he could not speak decidedly
as to some of them ~ Would his Chart be worth
a groat'?
•Dr. Spurzheim's 3rd Lecture- Lancet Vol. vii.
I may here remuk that a course of Lectures on Phrenology
was delivered by Dr. Spurzheim in London in 1825, which I
perused, and from .which I shall frequently quote with confi-
dence, in consequence of.their correctness being allowed .by
the Dr. himself, as stated in No. 275 Vol. I . 1828-9 of the
Lancet, in the following terms. "Dr. Spurzheim's Lectures

i;upporlers Dr. Gall, Dr. Spurzbeim, Mr. G.

~have been obtained for it, yet I think
they will be transitory, for n0. discovery ever

and freely exculpate its advocates from any
iutention .or wish to imp.ose upon the public a
system, which they themselves do not firmly
believe scmnd, and pre-eminently superior to all

power and bury all other systems in oblivion, and
thereby assume full authority to model and regu~

promulgation, a most talented abettor being very
desirous of learning the opinion of that distin-
guished. German Physiologist Blumen~ach, as ·
to the merits of his favourite science, requested
it, upon which the venerable Professor is said to
have replied in the following pithy distich :
" What is true is not new,
"And what is new is not true.,,
This salutary _
check did not operate at all in
dampingordiminishinghis ardour. In Edinburgh
very considerable interest became early shewn
for this new study, and a Phrenological society
was formed under the auspices of Mr. Combe,
whose talents appear " digna meliore fato."

condemned to utter worthlessness by the Phre-
nologist, I shall simply examine theclaims which
he has set up for superior accuracy and merit.
Most of my readers have doubtlessseen either
plates or plaster of Paris casts of the humrin
skull, intersected with numerous lines and fi..
gores, denoting the different sitesand boundaries
ofvarious organs. In this way the Phrenologist
bas divided each side ofthe head into thirty-five
distinctcompartments; onesidebeing said to af-
ford an exact counterpartofthe other. Each of
these compartments represents a separate organ
or faculty appertainingto thesame sized portion
ofbrain whichlies immediately underit; nota su-
perficial layer only, but the whole substance of
that extent and form down to its base. " Many
people think," says Dr. Spurzheim, "that be-
cause theorgansare marked onthe surface ofthe
skull, that they are really situated on the surface
ofthe brain, immediatelybelowthe place marked;
buttheorganitseljoccupiesthewholeofthatpart
ofthe brain situated belowthe marked place."•
This declaration conveys an idea that every
organ runs a vertical course; ifso, I aver that
.the anterior, lateral, and posterior organs can
have little or no brain; On the other hand,
should the anterior, lateral, and posterior be
intended to pursue a_
horizontal direction, then

these must woefully break in upon the bra.in of
those which are situated on the summit of the
head, since they must take a perpendicular di-
rection, and, as we are told, quite down to the
base. So that although this nice apportion-
ing of brain to each organ from superficies to
base, may appear very plausible on paper, and
seem upon the surface of a skull quite demon-
strative ofa plurality of organs ; yet when an-
alyzed, there will be found a direct anatomical
interference and contradiction to this dogma.
Their classjfication of organs is into two ORDERS,
called FEELINGS, and INTELLECTS ; the fonner
beingsubdivided intotwo genera, namedPropen-
S'ities and Sentiments: and the latter likewise into
two, called knowing and rejkcting. These form
three groups onthe Cranium. lst, Propensities
which are common to man and- other animals,
situated in the lower parts ofthe head, laterally
and posteriorly : 2nd, Sentiments, a few ofwhich
are common both to man and beast, occupying
the central and upper stories of the head : and
3rd, Intellects, taking possession ofthe forehead.
Each organ is considered as being endowed
with an independent action, and yet in some ob-
scure, undefinable way to be under .each other's
controul, according to the superior degree of
power or activity which either may happen to
possess ; such superiority being in great measure
indicated by what the Phrenologists term full
Google
u
developement orsize, which causes a prominence
ofthe skull overany organ that islarge, and part-
ly by a natural language.
This view of the human mind is stated to be
a science of observation, not made exclusively
upon man, butdrawn promiscuously from various
kinds of animals, according to their known in-
stinctive propensities suited the purpose, hence
it is emphatically pronounced to be founded on
nature: and from very many passages in the
writings of Phrenologists, we are desired fo go
to nature, and make enquiries of her, to satisfy
our minds as to the correctness or error of their
views. To this request I most willingly accede,
in order to discover whether nature and the
Phrem~logists are true to each other, or rather
whether t/u>:y have interpreted her so accurately,
as to find her yrelding them brains moulded into
a congeries of definite organs, each answering
the express purpose or function which t/u>:y have
assigned to it. They take for the ground oftheir
argument, that in an animal body there is a dis-
tinct apparatus for each sense, as for sight, hear-
ing, &c.; likewise peculiar organs for each secre-
tion, asthe liver, kidney, stomach, &c. ; therefore
say they, particular faculties, intellectuiµ as well
as animal, must be attached to particular instru-
ments; from which deduction they began to
parcel out the brain into so many distinct organs
with separate function5, and as these are said to
c 2
Google
12
proceed from the surfacedownwards to the base,
nothingcanmore clearly imply a real divisibility
of substance.
Their proof, then, ofplurality of organs in the
brain, is drawn from analogy with othercorporeal
parts. Itiswell known that analogical reasoning
can seldom be depended on for the foundation of
any science, and is not exactly the inductive
modeofphilosophizingrecommended by Bacon.•
An analogy, to be at all valuable, should bear
a striking resemblance in the comparison ; such
however is by no means the case in the present
instance. The organs of sight, hearing, and the
different secretions, which have been adduced as
analagous exan,ples, are very unlike phrenologi·
cal organs. Each of the former can with great
ease be dissected from the body, and shewn as
purely individual organs. AnatOmists can also
demonstrate every musclein an animal ; can di-
vide, and distinguish one membrane from ano-
ther; butthe most expertdissectors ofthe brain,
even Drs. Gall and Spurzhiem, (who I admit
evinced more dexterity in this work than many
others) have not been able to divide it into sepa-
rate parts, answering to their mental faculties.
They cannot remove organ after organ, clearly

and distinctly, so as to present them to ourview,
like the eye, tongue, kidney, liver, or stomach ;
· and no Physiologist presumes to recognize a va-
riety offunction, as proved, unless he can de-
monstrate a divisibility of structure.
Phrenologists attempt to defend this position
by saying, that we must acknowledge hearing
andseeingto be two verydifferent functions, and
yet that we cannottraceany structural difference
of their nervous endowments within the brain.
Certainly we cannot, for which reason we are
not warranted in asserting that there is any ;
but we do perceive a very different machanism
or construction of each organ outfli<k the brain,
and there, I think, the chief distinction resides.
I will ask any advocate for Phrenology, whether
he might not with as much reason infer analo-
gically, that becausemilk, bile, saliva, tears, and
many other secretions are all different, there
must be as many different kinds ofblood to pro-
duce them.,, Will he say that such is the fact,
when he knows the-
same arterial blood to be
constantly and regularly supplied to every organ
for preparing those divers fluids, and also that
the only appreciated difference is found ·in their
individual structure ~ If then one fountain of
blood suffices to form different fluids, why should
not one undivided brain be adequate to afford
nervous influence for a multitude of animal ·and
intellectual .purposes 'l Seeing therefore no

proof of plurality of organs mthe brain, deduci-
ble from their own data of anatomical analogies,
I say that nature is at variance with this phreno-
logical position. But supposing for a moment
that the brainis divisible into a seriesofindepen-
dentorgans, I would askany person of evencom-
mon sense, whether it is at all probable, that the
very limited numberlaid down by Phrenologists,
can provide for the innumerable propensities,
feelings, sentiment.s, and iritellect.s of the human
mind ¥ A northern reviewer has very pertinently
asked, why ·there may not exist three hundred
and fifty~ or three thousandfive hundred, as well
as thirty-five faculties to answer all the various
tastes, habit.s, accomplishment.s, and propensities
of man ~ The answer given, is, that action
here is confounded with power, or faculty, for
says Dr. Spurzheim " a small number of powers
may produce an infinite number of actions by
their combinations,"• and he adduces the alpha-
bet as an illustration of the power of numerical
increase by combinations,.and concludes by ob-
serving " I see no reason for believing therefore,
that there are too many, or that there are not
enough."t This being his opinion, it appears
rather singular that after the whole superficies of
the skull had been preoccupied by thirty-three
organs, he should think more necessary, and
particularly that he could possibly find room for
• Leet. xiii. Lancet. t Leet. xiii. Lancet.

15
them ; yet he afterwards added two, and hence
we may conclude that room will easily be found
for others, when future discovery shall produce
them. One of these newly discovered organs,
called Marvellousness, is situated on the head, at
an angle where theorgans ofIdeality, Hope, and
Cautiousness meet, so that one or other ofthese
must have surrendered a portion of brain, or
each subscribed a comer to make up this mar-
vellous faculty. Without enlarging upon this
principle ofaccommodation, I am quite at a loss
to perceive any·analogy between ·the alphabet
and the human brain ; the one, arbitrarily com-
posed of twenty-six letters, and of human inven-
tion, the other, one and indivisible in nature.
The idea likewise of combinations between dif-
ferent mental organs,inorderto form newactions,
is quite incompatable with that anological rea-
soning which Phrenologists took for their guide,
since we discover no combinations among the
corporeal organs in order to produce new func-
tions, each having a specific duty to perform. Do
any two organs of the senses combine to form a
third function ~ or any two secreting organs to
make a new fluid ~ Why then should the phre-
nological claim such a privilege ~ Let us how-
ever bring this combining power to another test,

all-sufficient. We observe among them an

love of parents for their offspring, an instinctjve
feeling belonging to man and other animals,
which nobody questions; but nature has endow-
ed us with another feeling equally undeniable, in-
stinctive, and strong; namely, A love of chiklren
<Yr ojfipring f <>r theirparents; yet the Phreno-
logists have not afforded us any organ to answer
it; and I challenge them to produce this feeling
with any combination of their famed thirty-five.
Fraternal love is another equally distinct, natu-
ral feeling; butthey have given us no Philadel-
phic organ, neither will any two or more combi-.
ned, produce it. A portion of brain has been
discovered for a new organ called Mirthfulness,
but other passions, equallyinfluential, as sorrow,
fear, anger, revenge, envy, hatred, malice, &c.
have none allotted to them in this new enclosure
act; nor will any combinations ofothers suffice
to form them. This combining principle also
tends to undermine the very foundation -of their
system, which declares, that every faculty or
"particular 'lllnriRJrstanding" must have a "par-
tic'lilar instrument " to represent it. By this
instrument they mean a portion of brain, which
cannot be obtainable upon their combining plan,
every inc~ of it being previously engaged by the
thirty-five organs. It seems therefore absurd,
to suppose that these thirty-five organs can en-
gender every other animal and intellectual feel-
ing, unlessthe composite faculties are allowed to

be brainless, a thing in direct contradiction to
their own rule.
In support ofthisdividing system, we are told,
that " the doctrine of plurality of powers is very
ancient,"• that Philosophers have not been sa-
tisfied with one single power of the mind, but
have divided them into imagination; memory,
judgment, association &c. True, they have
admitted thesediversities ofoperation,butalways
oonsidered them as so many attributes, states,
or modes of acting of an entire brain, and never .
dreamt of assigning particular portions of it to
each. They saw a reflecting or reasoning prin-
ciple at work upon every minute occurrence
afforded by the external world through the
medium of'the senses, and formed their opinions
from the resulting phenomena; for not being
able to find any division ofthe brain into organs,
they did not allow themselves to be home away
by visionary hypotheses upon the existence of
such a structure.
Anotherstrongunanswerableargumentagainst
plurality of organs is, that all consciousness is
tringk. We cannot imagine or think of two
things at the same instant of time, neither can
we reason upon two subjects at once : for how-
ever rapid the transition from one thought to
8,nother, we are always consdous of that trans-

ition; and it matters not whether the subject.be
trivial ormomentous, simple or complicated, the
whole mind must be employed in thinking of it.
If such were not the case, if separate parts of
the brain were end~wed with separate and inde-
pendent intellectual faculties, we should have a
right to expect the power ofemploying as many
of them .as we please at the same .moment:
Further, was the brain in truth composed ofdis-
tinct organs, we ought not by any analogical
.reasoning, to find the whole of them affected,
when any individual becomes injured. Thus
facts shew us that one eye, one ear, one kidney,
or one limb may be affected, or even lost by
injury or,disease, without the,other at all suffer-
ing; but what is the case with respect to brain ¥
here the analogy will not obtain. Remove a
portion of the skull over whatever assu'TMd
organ you please, press upon the brain beneath,
and instantly all consciousness disappears; ·t!Ver'fJ-
mental faculty becomes inert, anc;l the pers.on falls
senseless to the ground. Take away your press-
ure, and both the intellectual and animal powers
return. Surely, upon the phrenolog~cal princi-
ples of plurality of organs extending from the
surface of a brain to its base, 9f there-being a
duplicate ofeach, oftheir possessing an indepen-
dent action, we have a right to anticipate a ·very
different result; for example, if the organ of
language was pressed on, the person ought only

might have acquired; ifnumber, only the 1>9wer
of calculating ; or if tune, that it would only
spoil his fiddling: but not finding this partial
effect, we are justified in doubting, and almost
denying, the truth ofthe whole system.
Exclusively ofthe arguments already adduced
against plurality of organs, I must not omitto ·
state, that by their own admission great discre-
pance of opinion prevailsamong themselves,as to
the number, identity, and application offaculties.
Ifyoucomparethe thirty-three organs ofDr. Gall

we observe in nature, so far as regards the actions

Dr. Spurzheim; whilst his organic vocabulary of
Conscientiousness,·Form, Space, Resistance, an~
some others, find no place .in Gall's list. Gall
denied an organ of Hope, Dr. Spurzheim (as we
.might expect) entertains it strongly. Gall spoke
of an organ of Religion and Holiness, asserting
that it indicated a proof of God's existence ;
whilst Spurzheim calls the same Veneration, but
thinks that it is not necessarily indicative ofa

ever, individuals who have had this cerebral part
very much elevated, and yet have not been rel?,.
gi,ous ;"• and' againt the middle part (meaning
the or~n in question) is that which gives rise
to feelings moral and religious, to pay respect to
beings around us, and pay veneration to super-
natural, beings, or to saints.'' Some may be dis-.
p<>Sed to deny any difference of opinion on this
important organ, between these two eminent
Phrenologists. Prwccptor and Pupil ; but I wish
them to consider, that a purely religious feeling,
or worship of an Almighty Creator and Ruler of
the world; as intended by Dr. Gall, is totally dif-
ferent from that which pays homage to beings
around us ; and on beholdit;ig a finely developed
organ of veneration, we must be quite at a loss
to kI:~ow whether its possessor entertains any re-
ligion, and a belief in holy writ, or whether all
bis veneration is to be expended upon sUhlunary
imortals, in other words whether it is idolatrous.
To admit an unison ofsentiment upon this organ
between the two Professors, is allowing-too great
a latitude of function ; and moreover when I read
tliat "wemay steal from others, and cheat others,
and yet be benevolent,"t I am utterly at a loss
how to reconcile such glaring contradictions and
perversion.of language. By this phrenological

have ·merely to remark, th~ insanity of every
kind, is an unnatural, morbid state, and quite in-
admissible as evidence ofthe trothorerrorofany
mental manifestations. A court oflaw never en-
tertains for one moment an'idea of correct evi-
dence being give by a lunatic of any description,
and a· Philosopher never acts wisely in bringing
him forward to substantiate sound doctrines.
· I have hitherto been combating the principal
tenet ofPhrenology, namely," plurality of organs,
andendeaV<>ured to shew that it ba:s no founda-
tion either in anatomy, physiology, pathology, or
analogy. An~ther tenet has been broached equal-
ly hypothetical ; they assert that the.brain is OOU-
ble, yielding_a duplicate ·or eaeh organ, inferred
by their favourite mode ·of reasoning, froin their
being two.eyes, two ears, and likewise from the
nerves being given off in pairs. By this ingeni-
ous device they in some measure overcome an
argument, which must· ·otherwise completely
refute their system, (to wit) that considerable
portions ofbrain may be lost from 'injury' with-
out any apparent diminution of intellect upon
recovery ;. and their explanation of this is, that
the corresponding organs on the opposite side
remain sound. There are however no solid
arguments in favour of a double function of the
brain, nor even ofa perfectly double structure.
True it is, that the brain apparently consists of
two halves ; that it sends off from its base the
Google
nerves in pairs; one to each eye, to each ear7
and so on; ·but it should be particularly borne
in mind, that there is an union or commissurebe-
tween the two halves, and that their function is.
single. Themotionofboth eyes isquite synchro-
nous, and their vision one; we have no doubk
hearing, smelling, or tasting; and it is not be-
cause one eye may be lost, orone senseofhearing
gone, orone limb removed, that we are to infer a
double structure and action ofthe brain; for the·
analogy to be just, should extend farther. Thus.
every one knows that man can exist and officiate
with only one eye, one ear, or one 8.nn &c., and
since Phrenologists inform us that when one or
'!IWre otgans on either side ofthe brain are lost
from injury, theirfeUows supply the defect, they
oughtupon this principle to make him exist, and
perforin all intellectual and animal functions with
only one half 'of his brain ; when they can
demonstrate this, by showirig me the man that
under such a condition can " live, and move, and
have his being," all my opposition shall cease.
They seem to have erred at the threshold, in
comparing an organ which is apparently com-
posed oftwo halves, with those that have dupli-
cates, and many examples·of eachare observable
in an animal .frame. To the former belong the
heart, tongue, nose, skull, and its contents the
brain : to the latter arms, legs, eyes, and ~rs.
So that the two classes of organs are very dis-
Google
similar and distinct from each other. Dr. Spurz-
heim informs us that "one of Gall's friends, a
Physician, often complained that he could not
think with the left side of bis head ; the right
side is one inch higherthan the left."• :Before
this I never heard ofany sane pe?Son making so
singular a complaint, and it would have been
desirable to know what his peculiar sensations
were, which led him to make this discovery. If
it depended upon the less perfect developement
of organs on the thoughtless side, its existence
shoUld have been perpetual, but we are not in-
formed that this was the case.
Two otheranatomical objections to thissystem
demand our notice ; the one is a difference of
parallelism between the brain and outer surface
ofthe skull, and the other a difference in form,
( often very remarkable ) betweenthe two halves
of a skull, supposing a mesial line to be drawn·
longitudinally from 'the nose backwards to the
nape of the neck. As regards the first objection,
I must be·allowed to state, for the information
of non-medical readers, that the skull is compo-
sed of two tables or plates ofbone, united to each
other; consequently, the surface of the inner
plate cannot possibly be parallel with that of the
outer, any more than the least oftwo circles can
be parallel with the larger; hut I shall not cavil
Dr. Spurzheim on Phrenology, 1816~
Google
about the difference that obtains between the
brain and superficies ofthe skull at many parts,
because it is slight; yet in one, where several
intellectual organs are situated, there isso strik-
ing and unequivocal a disparity of parallelism,
that it cannot pass unheeded. This part is the
forehead, immediately above the nose, where the
two plates or tables of the skull ar~ separated
from each other, thereby forming cavities called
by Anatomistsfrontal sinuses. These cavities
are ofdifferent dimensions in different persons,
and often of considerable size. Dr. Spurzheim
himselfadmits his having seen them "aninch"•
in diameter, which must have separated the in-
ternal and external plates to the same extent,
consequently the brain must have been at a like
distance from the outside ofthatskull; and since
brain, and not bone, is the seat of intellect, how
can it be possible to know with precision, or any
pretensions to accuracy, its actual develQpement
at this part ¥ and yet directly over it are placed
several organs. I am notacquainted with any ana-
tomical fact which speaks morestrongly against
Phrenology, and even Dr. Spurzheim's admis-
sions on this part, speak volumes. He says,
" There are difficulties above difficulties in the
forehead."t "Injudging ofthe powers situated
hereabouts, there is the difficulty of the frontal

sinuses to overcome ; I grant that, but they do
not interfere with the organ of Colouring, al-
though they do a little with Individuality and
Size." Just in proportion to the magnitude of
these sinuses, will the brain be nearer to or fur-
ther from the outside of the head, from which
alone we can possibly judge of large or small de-
velopement. With a full developement or pro-
minence hereabouts, the Phrenologist is bound to
admit, consonantly with the terms of his art,
(since a priori he cannot know the size of the
frontal sinuses) that the organs under it are well
developed, although it might be that the brain
does not approach within an inch ofthe surface;
whilst on the other hand, there may be scarcely
any fullness here, when great developement must
be denied, although the brain may be found
nearer the surface, and, in fact, be better devel·
oped than in the former case. With this struc--
ture in the forehead, how is it possible tO judge
from mere external inspection, whetherthe brain
protrudes much or little ; and as the superficies
of a head is made the Phrenological index of its
brain and powers within, was it not preposterous
to place organs in a part ofsuch variable and un-
certain structure 'l Ingenuity is seldom wanting
to support favourite theories, or overcome diffi-
culties. A staunch supporter, and author ofil-
lustrations ofPhrenology, admits that in marked
cases of large frontal sinuses, the external table
Google
of·the skull is not a wrrect index ofthe shape -0r
quantity of brain behind it; but he asserts, that
"while.a man is in the prime oflife, and healthy,
and manifests the faculties of the frontal organs,
auch a cavity seldom exists. It is <ml;y in old
age, or insubjects that have not manifested such
faculties as are referred to, ( or have manifested
them only in a low degree, owing to disease or
natttral conformation) when it is fwmed; the
·brain retiring, and, by -a wise provision, the
inner tohk ofthe skullfollowing it."!!*
I have ~ reason for calling in question the
learned author'sabilities, and general scientific
attainments, but I presume that he isno practical
anatomist, otherwise he woul!l have known that
although the frontal sinuses are sometimessmall,
and·occasionally wanting, yet that they are nei-
ther peculiarto old age, (being fully developed
in the vigour oflife) nor are they by any Anato-
mists accounted a diseased structure. He would
have known that purely on account oftheir ge-
neral occurrence, medical students are always
taught to expectthem, and regard them as parts
ofthe skull, upon which they are not to apply an
instrument used in trepanning : and as to the
brain retiring, and internal table of the frontal
bone following, I believe it to be purely hypo-
thetical. I never heard or read of such athing

as a retiring brain, even in old age ; and why it ·
should recede from the forehead, in preference
to any other part, it is impossible to imagine,
since we very frequently observe the i'lltel1ecU
remain strong, and clear, after the animal fao-
cultieshavebecome very enervatedand decrepid.
If the brain does shrink or become somewhat
less in old age, which I will not dispute~ we
should rather expect to find its diminution
general ; consequently, if nature was desirous of
following it with the inner table ofthe skull, she
would most probably cause a g;enwral, not par-
tial separation of the two tables, or else an
universal thickening ofthe bones. The contrary
ofwhich almostinvariably occurs in old age, the
intervening cellular part, or what Anatomists
call the diploe being then obliterated. On go-
ing to comparative anatomy, we observe .the
young and healthy calf, sheep, and other brute
animals with conspicuous frontal sinuses, and we
may presume that in these the brain will not be
deemed retiring, since old age is esteemed a
necessary condition for that process. I there-
fore maintain that the frontal sinuses are a per-
fectly natural structure, neither morbid, nor
peculiar to old age, nor to those who have not
manifested the faculties prescribed to this part
by Phrenologists. Shouldthat view of the deye-
lopement of the frontal sinuses be correct, as
recently given.by .Dr. Milligan in his edition of
Google
!9'
Magendie's Physiology, it is very clear that old
age has nothing whatever to do with these sinu~
ses.• The last anatomical objection that I
shall adduce, is the difference of size and shape
which often exists between the two halves of a
skull. This I admit is frequently small, but in
very many instances remarkable : as a case in
point I shall adduce Dr. Gall's medical friend,
who could only think on one side of his head,
and the right side of which was one inch higher
than the left; and unless my eyes greatly de-
ceived me when at Edinburgh some years ago,
an eminent pillar of this new schoolappeared to
have a most marked difference between the two
sides of his head posteriorly. To those who en-
tertain the opinion that the two halvesform one
brain, with an unity ofaction, these differences
are of no moment; but to the Phrenologist, who
advocatesa duplicate oforgans, and that those on
one side have an accurate counterpart in the

other, it must be a matter of regret and embar-
.rassment to find a want of uniformity between
bQth. ·To detect these differences of shape and
size, a front or back view of a person•s head is
necessary.
In order to form a more mature and correct
judgement of the merits of this -conjectural
science, a few more partjculars remain for obser-
vation. These are, First,the influence ofsize or
·full developement of organs, together with the
.great disproportion of brain observable between
Intellects.andPropensities: Second,the admission
ofbrute instincts and propensities in determining
the mental faculties of man, as exemplified in
manyorgans; and Third, the applicationofPhre-
ROlogy to education and the callings oflife.
In tracing the Phrenologist's reasoning with
respect to the influence of size ofbrain, we dis-
cover many discrepancies and apparent contra-
dictions : at one· time he labours to prove that
size is of the first consequence, and at another
of little.moment.
Dr. Spurzheim observes, " I shall be able to
shew you, that a person having a very small
brain does not and cannot display muck mental
power;"• in illustration of which, he produced
models of two brains ofidiots very small, and a

I will appeal to the good sense of my readers,
an~ ask whether this offers to our view that just
comparison, on which we can fonn a correct
judgment ; for original deformity or disease to
be placed by the side ofsoundness and great per-
fection '? In fairness, ought it not to be a com-
parison between small and large heads, where
the owners of both have not evinced any signs
of mal-formation or idiotcy ~ Independently of
this, all idiotic heads are not deficient in frontal
developement, (I know an idiot with a very well
formed head) and there is also much diversity in
their size and shape.
This unjust comparison brings to my recollec-
tionanother very similar. One evening I visited
the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh, and
there were exhibited by the side of each other"
for the sake of contrast, and as evidence ofthe
correctnessofthe science, three skulls;an idiot's"
a CaITibbee's, and that of some fully developed
unknown. · The Carribbee•shead beingflattened
on its forehead was exhibited together with the
Idiot's to exemplify deficient or total want of
understanding. Itis howeveran accredited.fact,
that certain of the Carribbee tribes are in the
habit of making the forehead flat by artifi~ial
pressure during infancy and childhood, yet with;.
out loss of intell.~ct, and I have seen such a ·head
ofa very clever Carribbee Indianchief; the exhi-
biting them therefore as exemplars ofweak minds
Google
was incorrect. Dr. Spurzh~im seems inclined
to distrust the accounts of any artificial cause.of
this depression, and cannot well imagine how
pressure can be applied to a forehead by any ap-
paratus without producing a counter-pressure,
and counter-flat, on the back part ofthe head.
He says " If there be pressure applied to the
forehead, I should like to know how the apparatus
is applied without producing counter-pressure ~
I find the anterior part ofthe head much depress-
ed, .and I find the posterior part v.ery much de-
veloped, ~ow if a string were tied all around the
head, it must prevent developement all around.
I cannot conceive of there being pressure with-
outthere beingcounter-pressure. "• Unquestion-
ably pressure requirescounter-pressure, but each
may be ofsimilaror dissimilar kinds, and very lit-
tle.mechanical ingenuityis requisite to effectthat
pressure and counter-pressurewhich will produce
exactly what Dr. Spurzheim represents in his
Carribbee heads(namely)an anterior depression
with a posterior developement. If you apply a
ligature of tape tightly round a head, it must
~nevitably produce equable pressure on all parts,
and ofcourse equally prevent developement; but

theirvarious exami.Dations of heads, have diBco-
vered many superior intellects and cleverfeijo'WB
withsmallor moderatelydevelopedorgans, which
would greatly tend to undermine their·
.system,
and therefore sought to modify.the meaning of
size• .Be this a.S it may, they have thought it
neces8ary to introduce a quality or condition of
organ, tantamount to ·full developement, which
is termed act-tui.ty; a quality very undefinable, in
the sense used, and difficult of detection·, .for we
are told " the study of determining the nature
ofa function-is more easy than it is to determine
the.degree ofactilvity ofa function.• "

If a combination of full developement is per
ceived in the organs of self-esteem, firmness, and
love ofapprobation, then they consider the posses-
sor to be veryconceited, and touchy, and that one
must take care of him in society. Ifthey see a
person with a large organ ofself-esteem what do
they learn from it '? " I know (says Dr. Spurz•
heim) that the person has a good opinion of
himself, and that is all. "•
To aid and illustrate phrenology they have
brought physiology, which Dr. Spurzheim prefers
calling" naturallanguage." This language may,
and often does prove serviceable to us in .the
study of character, but although so much has
been written on it by Lavater and others, who
ever thinks of confiding on its a.oouracy in the
present artificial state of soeiety, and from the
difference it assumes in different countries :
The natural language therefore of man must
be at all times most fallacious, particularly as
he can dissemble and play the hypocrite. In
applying this principle to the different organs,
·Dr. Spurzheim when speaking of Secretiveness,
says, "How can I know when this power is
active '? By the natural language, by the appear-
ance of the whole countenance ; such a perso~
looks sideways, looks about the room, but never
·looks you in the fiice."t Very plausible indeed !

adduced, I intend remaining a sceptic.
· Having disposed ofsize, I shall advert to the
use that Phrenologists have me.de of brute ani-
mals in the formation of theirsystem, and which
appears to have been carried to a ridiculous
extreme. When we compare man with brutes,
in the common possession of certain sentient
and instinctive ·principles, the comparison is
legitimate and just, because we know the facts
to ~st; but when we proceed to assert without
proof, that particular parts of a brute's brain
answer to certain organs, and impel him to per~
'form certain known propensities ; and that if
man has any thing like such a conformation of
brain, as shewn by the head, he must also have
the samepropensities; then I say the comparison
becomes gratuitous, weak, and unphilosophical.'
I shall exemplify this in one organ only : " ex

greater developement ·or ·Width of head in the
carnivorous animals. Onconsideringthe instinc·
·tive appetite of these rapacious creatures, we
·find it solely for flesh and blood; to obtain which
they must often have to contend with other ani-
.mals ofmuch superior size. Forexample, wea-
sels, destroy rabbits and hares, though very
inferiorto them in size. This then seems to
imply a need for some remarkable muscular
power or appropriate weapons, or both ; and in
examining these destructive animals we find
both. The falcon tribe require great strength
ofjaws and neck, to hold and tear in pieces their
·prey. The wolf, fox, weasel, and polecatdepend
upon these powers for similar purposes. Now,
we invariably find, that where great power is re-
quired, more numerous or stronger muscles are
essential, the attachments ofwhich necessarily
require a broad surface; and here we have it for
receiving those muscles on·the back part of the
' neck, which are used for bearing off prey' for
tearing it pieces, or for shaking it ; and illustra-
tionsareseen in the tiger, which with the greatest
ease bears offa man in its mouth ; in the kite,
whilst tearing in pieces a lamb; and in the dog,
which gives its victim a most terrible shake, ·as
well as gripe. The herbivorous animals on the
other hand, as the bare, rabbit, and roe, (Dr.
Spurzheim's·own selection ) do not·require great

Google
strengh of muscles in the posterior part of.the
neck~ and consequently there was less breadth of
head necessary for muscular attachments. Few
,animals are more weak in the neck than the rah-
·hit and hare, and their heads are narrow, whi.1$
the cat, an animal of no larger size, has great
.power of neck, and a broad head. This expla-
nation adapts means to ends, and appears more
rational than the onegiven byPhrenologists, who
must be as ignorant of what part of brain gives
·the impulse to destroy~ as the animal itself. But a
;fact which has still more strongly impressed on
my mind·, the delusion of comparing man. with
brutes in mental orgtins, more particularly in
·reference to the one under cmisideratioh,, is.this;
we never find it to be the natural inclination or
.act of any carnivorous animal, however savage,
·to·destroy its fellcnv ; but it kills other animals
in order to satisfythe·appetite ofhunger implant-
ed in its nature, and not:fromanyevil ~le:

fellow-creature, not to 'satisfy hunger, but either
under an insane impulse, or what ·is far worse
.under a most depraved moral principle; from a
:want ofthat fear and love of God, which causes
him to despise his commandments.
Man, in the commissionof this foul crime, has

perhaps be here, reminded;.that the rabbit some-

nologists themselves, and most school-boys know
that this proceeds from their officiousness in dis-
turbing her when approaching the period of par-
turition. I will ask any candid person whether
the destruction of life by a carnivorous animal,
committed in order to satisfy the call of hunger,
and the murder of man by man, bear the least
analogy to each other' and whether if Phreno-
logists knew the seat of that organ in brutes
which impels them to destroy, as well as they
know their alphabet, they had any reason for
identifying. that action with murder'# To the
comparison of man with man.mentally, I cannot
possibly entertain·an objection, but for the rea-
sons which I have just stated, I enter my protest
against instituting analogies between the reason-
ing faculty of man and the instinctive propensi-
ties of brutes, for the purpose of founding a
system of mental philosophy.
It will probably excite the surprise of my
readers to hear that Phrenologists do not always
consider theorgan ofdestructiveness contributory
to the perpetration of murder, at least they do
notalways look for its being large, butaccording
to circumstances, they bring others in as acces-
sary, even those of a superior order. "If I am
told (says Dr. Spurzheim) that an individual
Google
&I
has committed murder during his insanity, do
you suppose that in every case I should look for a
large organofdestructiveness~ I would enquire
as to the motive, and ifI found that a person had
dispatched another in order to save him eternal-
ly, having sent him away that he should sin no
more, I should rather look for the organ of con..
1cientious·ness to be large thanthat ofdestructive-
ness."* Upon this principle, the organs ofvene-
rationt and benevolence may be similarly af-
fected and equally implicated in the praiseworthy
deed of saving sinnerseternally, by despatching
them, and in this most singular way be still
instruments of good : so that three of the most
humane and exalted faculties ofour nature, may
by phtrenowgical reasoning, be made indired~
ly conducive to a most horrid act : three organs
whose excellent functions have obtained the title
of controuling powers, inasmuch as they are said
to counteract the evil tendency of those that are
base, bad, and inferior. Immediately the.Doctor
admitted the presence of' insanity, he shouldhave
di~regarded every species of organic develope-
ment, whether small or large. Can we for one
moment calculate upon what actions a madman
will cpll)mit, or when and how he will commit

them 'I Certainly not. Consequently no depeli•
deuce can or ought to be placed on the motivea
which he himself assigns for those actions, and
hence it must be esteemed no great mark of
wisdom to be inquiring after them.
I am now led to the consideration of another
Phrenological tenet, namely, the presence of a
modifying, antagonizing, or correcting principle,
by which some orga.nS are said to possess a con·
troul over others, so as to check their evil incli•
nations. Dr. Spurzheim says" an essential.thing
to bear in mind respecting the feelings, is, that
they are blind. No feeling judges. There is a
difference between the feelings. Some give im-
pulses only, others modify them. Such as give
impulses are called in Phrenology propensities,
whilst other feelings are styled sentiments, by
which the propensities are modified."• In physics
I readily admit blindness and want of judgment
in regulating powers, as in the safety-valve of
a steam-engine, but in living .mental organs,
I feel at a loss how to comprehend a power
of controul or regulation, . unconnected with
some judicial capacity. The ·higherfeelings of
conscientiousness, benevolence, and veneration
are said to modify, counteract, or controul ·the

centrativeness not being able " to act of itself ,.
Dr. Spurzbeim says "all the powers which I

seemed more a propos or operative than the in-

fifteen memories ; not one power ofimagination,
but fifteen. These.advantages and acquisitions,
which have been so liberally bestowed on the in-
tellects, are, without any assigned reason, denied
the Propensities and Sentiments : neither are
there any organsofthis kind specially appointed
for their use : yet, deprived as they are of such
advantages, we never find the Propensity of Ac-
quisitiveness in want of perception to see the
various modes of gaining riches, nor of memory
to remember them ; neither do we find that of
Secretiveness forgetting when and where to con-
ceal its pelf; the former ofwhich is well exem-
plified in a Pickpocket, and the latter in a
Miser.
In perusing the Phrenologist's descriptions
· ofthe individual organs, whether animal or in-
tellectual, we meet with inconsistencies and ab-
surdities at every page, and many things to excite
laughter; how therefore could they expect their
opponents to be so very grave, as not to indulge
that vein moderately ' The shaft of ridicule
alone would amply sufficeto overthrow the whole
system, butwhere plainarguments are abundant,
they are far preferabl~, although there can be
no objection to the employment of both.
The organ of Amativeness (which here im-

whom he attended in hysterics. Why his atten-
tion should have been directed to this propensity
at that particulartime, I am at a loss to conceive,
but having previously considered its probable
seat, he might merely take that opportunity of
examining this part of her bead. The idea was
suggested by animals which are supposed to be
excessively amative, and fond .of " billing and
cooing " as the Pigeon, Sparrow, Rabbit, and
Cock, in whose heads he had observed a great
posterior prominence, and .immediately noted it
down as the seat of this propensity ; accounted it
an establisMd fact, and then transferre,d it to
the human cranium. His notions also were, that
the developement of this part was not co~picu­
ousbeferethe·age ofpuberty, and Dr. Spurzheim
speaking of this organ, says, "Examine the
.heads of children, and you will find .this part of
the head veryflat, verylittk ti.eve~."• Know-
ing that children could not possibly feel this
propensity, I was. the more induced to examine
.this part attentively, and if I have any tact at
all; ( although I scarcely think it will be admitted
thatI have the Phrenological " Tactusemditus")
I will take upon me to say, that dev:elopement
of this organ is as great proportionably in
.children as in adults, and as to comparing man
in this respect with a cocksparrow, is it not truly

In closeunion and just above the last-mention•
ed organ is Philoprogenitiveness or love of off-
spring; awell-known instinctive feeling common
to man and brute. It does not appear that any
sounder reasons were employed in determining
the abode of this faculty. · Dr. Gall, was five
years in consideringwhat this protuberancecould
mean, when in the midBt of his difficulties, " a
Clergyman who attended him, observed that
monkeys had a strong attachment· to their prog·
eny."• ·His own observations prior to this were;
that " he observed a distinct protuberance on the
posterior part of the heads of·women ; and in
comparing the skulls of his collection, he found
a smaller elevation on the skulls of children, and
even on those of !Ilonkeys."t This apparent
agreement of protuberance between the woman
and monkey, and the hintfrom his pupil, induced
the Doctor to fix the seat ofthis organ in perpe•
tuity ; reasons which exhibit more caprice than
sound judgment. The heads of children are in
every part less developed than those of adults;
let their shape be what it may; but since it is
quite clear that the propensity in-question never
can be felt by them, that part of their heads
answering to it should upon phrenological prin·
ciples be veryflat, as is said to be the case with

amativeness,yet Dr. Gall admits that it was de-
vel,oped.
Dr. Spurzheim fully concurs with his precep-
tor's opinion respecting this organ, and entertains
an idea that females are more attached to their
offspring than males. To make this dogma of
any value, such superior attachment should be
t?-niversal throughout the whole animated nature,
and likewise invariable at all ages ; but number-
less examples, both human and comparative,
might be adduced to prove that parental attach-
ment to their progeny, as a law of nature, is
perfectly equal. Very many male birds feed
their young, and pay them as much attention in
every way as the females ; pigeons and sparrows
are among these, and they even sit on the eggs
alternately during incubation, so that these birds
are amative in every sense. Male and female
foxes, with some others, are ·admitted by Dr.
Spurzheim to participate equally in this feeling.
I grant that in most animals, particularly the
mamrniferous, it is the female's peculiar province
to be in·constant attendance upon their offspriµg
during infancy, for several obvious reasons, and
therefore a greater attachment might be inferred,
but surely this is an insufficient reason for deny-
ing the male eq~l affection. Is the father of
children to feel less· love for them than their

The absurd sentiments which have been put
forth by Phrenologists respecting this organ are
sickening. We are told that "Gall possesses
the skull of a woman, who being S'ick, had the
confirmed notion of being pregnant with five
childlren, and in this skull the corresponding
&rgan is extremely developed."• What an
exceedingly clever illustration this ofthe infalli-
bility of their system. These Philosophers.have
often warned others against drawing compari-
sons and conclusions from diseased conditions,
and yet bring forward the fancies of a sick, and
perhaps delirious woman to corroborate their
views. The infei:ences drawn from a small de-
velopement of this affectionate organ are strange
and unnatural. Dr. Spurzheim observes "a-
mong mankind this Phenomenon must be consi-
deredas a circumstance indirectly conducive to

Infa'lttidde. We have examined the shape of
the head in twenty-nine women who were lnfan·
ticides ; twenty·
-five of them had the organ of
Philoprogenitiveness very small."• · This asser·
tion does not absolutely amount to a positive
avowal that a mother, who has this organ small,
cannot avoid destroying her children, but it ap·
proaches within a line, and supposing that with
this confonnation of head, her organs ofcontroul
are likewise small, and that of destructiveness
large, how, according to Phrenology could In-
fanticide be well avoided. We are toldhowever'
that in four of these unfortunate women, the
organs of Philoprogenitiveness were not found
small, hence they must have loved their child·
ren; then we ask, why murder them, why com-
mit so cruel an act ~ When we read...of women
perpetrating this foul and unnatural deed with
organs of affection for their offspring very dif-
ferently developed, the cause assigned by Phreno-
logists, even as indirect, must be fallacious.
Butto shew how woefully mistaken these Literati
sometimes are, I will give a paragraph which
appeared some months ago in one of the London
Newspapers, I believe in the Courier, brit not
having particularly observed, whether it was the
Courier, Times, or Globe, I was ·then perusing,
will not positively state which. " The unfortu-

ago for destroying her child, has been examined
by Dr. E. a distinguished Phrenologist; who
(not knowing her history,. and therefore free from
all intention ofbringing discredit on the execu-
tive) on inspecting the head, pronounced the
organ of destructivenessto be impe;rfectly tkvelo-
ped, whilst that of Philoprogenitiveness was very
str<mg " and the Doctor's words were, she had a
great attachment" for her children."
This to me is satis swperqiu to root up the
the doctrine, for here an act is committed, al-
though the strongest phrenological reasons con'!'
curred to prevent it. In furt.h~r support of this
organ, Dr. Spurzheim mentions the fondness of
some savage and fierce tribes for their children,.
and then exhibits the very full developement.of
Carribbee heads at this part. I have before en-
deavoured to account for the posterior fullness.of
their heads mechanically, and the fondnettJ of
savages for their children argues nothing toward&
establishing this organ; for do we notfind u ar·
dent a love ofoffspring. in the fierce and rapa-
cious·tiger~ Then why not expect it equ~y in

The next organ on which I purpose making a
few observations, is Inhabitiveness, situated close
to the one just commented on, but higher in
the head, and concerning which the most emi-
nent Phrenologists are at variance. Sir George
Mc'Kenzie observes "but we are not satisfied
there is such a faculty, because itsfunctions would
he too general perhaps for a single faculty ;"•
whilst Drs. Gall, Spurzheim, and Mr. Combe
maintain the contrary opinion, but unfortunately
for the science, all three differ respecting its
functions. The first pronounced it as giving the
propensity to hold high places, and identified it
with pride ; whilst the second endows it with ~
peculiar inclination for certain habitations, and
hence terms it Inhabitiveness, and the $ird as-
cribes to it a totally dissimilar function (namely)
Concentration of Ideas. It would have been
wiser, had these eminent Phrenologists held a
c~uncil for making ~ome amicable arrangement,
rather than give the world such opposite conclu-
sions, and expose the weakness of their doctrine.
In order to shew what singular illustrations are
brought forward in defence of it, I sball cite a
curious passage from Dr. Spurzheitp. After

speaking of the determined action of thiS power
in various animals for peculiar abodes, he says,
" Even among rats, some are better pleased with
the higher parts ofthe house, this is the case
with the old English or blue rat, whilst the Nor-
wegian rat or brown rat is most fond ofthe lower
parts ofthe house; howeversince the Norwegian
rats have been imported, they have nearly de-
stroyeil the ancient inhabitants : and we find a
cowtiderable dijference in the organization of
their heads."
Both kinds of rats we are informed delight in
their respective abodes, one· in the garret, the
other in the cellar, each therefore must possess
the propensity in question ; but as considerable
difference is observed in the organizationoftheir
heads, we have good ground for inferring that
each inherits a differently shaped organ. Ifthere-
fore two ofone genus differ so materially from each
other in th~ir organs of Inhabitiveness, what an
extreme diversity must obtainthroughout nature,
knowing thatan almostinfinite variety ofpredilec-
tion for particular dwelling places is inherent in
different animals; consequently, howcould Phre-
nologists assign correct locality or form to such
a Proteus like organ 'i But does not the total de·
struction of the English rat by the Norwegian,.
carry strong conviction to the mind that the
dwellings of both are similar, since they must

either in the upper or lower stories of the house,
for had each remained in that dwelling appointed
him by Phrenologists, with that invincible attach-
ment* which belongs to many animals for parti-
cular haunts, the war of extermination could·not
have been waged. It therefore intimates plainly
either that the Norwegian must have gone to
the upper story, or the English descended to the
lower, or else that their halints are exactly similar.
Land rats in general are more partial to sinksand
all underground dark holes, yetthey feelno reluc-
tance to ascend into store rooms, warm thatched
barns, com stacks, or wherever their wants can
be well supplied, and I believe that the difference
of organization in their heads has not the least
connection with their inhabitive propensities.

in height somewhat proportionate to the physical

this fact, in·contradistinction to the roe; butwhat
degree ofweightshall we attach to this argument,
when we behold the eagle whose dwelling is
exalted above .that of most animals, with a
head very low at this particular point, and the
woodcock, which lives in woods upon the mossy
swamps, with this organ remarkably prominent:
By Mr. Combe this faculty has been called
Concentrativeness, or the power ofconcentrating
our thoughts; an opinion quite unlike that ofhis
two brethren, not being in the least allied either
to Pride or lnhabitiveness. No doubt this gen-
tleman had grounds for dissenting from the views
of his coadjutors. According to the Edinburgh
Review, 1826,• he possesses this disputed organ
in a high degree, and knowing that his thoughts
have been exceedingly concentrated on the study
of Phrenology, he might be allowed to claim a
deeper acquaintance with its Phrenological na-
ture ; still .from such conflicting testimonies, but
more so from its naturally diversified structure, I
am constrained to say with Sir George Mc'Ken-
zie,t " we are not satisfied that there is such a
faculty."
Both Dr. Spurzheim and Mr. Combe have

agreed that whenever a faculty is in a state of
activity, the individual must make motions or
gestures in the line or direction ofthe external
organ. " Whatever the situation of the organ ·
may he which is active, there the head is canied
in that direc:tWn, whether laterally, upwards or
downwards."• Now whilst the former strenu·
ously contends that concentration of ideas takes
place in the forehead, which would cause a per-
son in deep thought to incline his head forwards ;
the latter as strongly maintains that ittakes place
in the hack part, and causes the head to be
thrown backwards : but in order to rec<>ncile
these differences and accommodate such diame-
trically opposite conclusions, as well as actions,

tO any individual who has ever reflected intense-
ly' whether a concentration of ideas, .commonly
called deep thought, does not induce perfect still·
ness of head and composure of body ~ We are
constantly in the habit of nodding assent, the
organ for which, according to the above rule,
ahould of course be situated in the forehead, but
as yet none has been delineated.; being however
quite as habituated to signify dissent by a hori·
z-0ntal shake of our heads, whereare we to search
for the active organ which. represents this oscil·
lating motion ? I shall probably be told that there
are n-0 organs of assent and dissent. Ifso, I ask
what internal powers impel us to make those in·
telligible motions ofthe head; which appear quite
as significant and characteristic of the activity of
~me organs, as those of ooncentrativeness.
In every remaining organ are to be s.een many
traits ofvague hypothesis, gratuitous assumption,
and erroneous induction; I shall not,.however
analyze the whole, but limit my observations to a
few, and conclude with some general remarks.
Passing over the faculties of adhesiveness and
combativeness, we cometo thatofdestructiveness.
This was called by Dr. Gall the organ ofmurder
Google
70
which bis ·coadjutors finding exceedingly injuri·
ous to the cause of Phrenology, softened down
to destructiveness, but this was only a change of
name, not nature; since its.habitat is exactly on
the same spot of the cranium to which Gall first
· affixed it, and they endow itWithsimilar functions,
for we are told by Dr. Spurzheim, that it gives
" the propensity to pinch, scratch, bite, cut,
break, pierce, devastate, demolish, .ravage, burn,
massacre, strangle, butcher, suffocate, kill, poison,
murde·r, and assasS'inate!!!"•
I have had occasion to observe that its situa-
tion and function were wholly derived from the
heads of carnivorous animals, and, in my humble
opinion, upon very shallow grounds. For several
reasons I altogether deny the existence of an
organ of murder.
First : Because no proof exists ofthe portion
of bra.in assigned to this organ ·by Phrenologists,
being that which impels animals to destroy life.
Se.cOnd: Because I conceive murder and de-
structiveness to be two totally different principles.
Third: Because I do not believe that God
ever created any organ with so diabolical a
function.
Every being under heaven is endowed with an
instinctive appetite for particular kinds of. food,
commensurate with which are its meansofobtain-

71
ing it. Some are impelled by this natural feeling
to subsist on flesh, and these have certain corpo-
real instruments fitted for procuring it~ by
destroying other animals ; they have lik.ewise
stomachs capable of digesting it, and it alone.
With such an union ofappetite and digestive a?'
paratus, the law ofnature clearly points out that
the destruction of life becomes necessary and
allowable. But there is another law of nature
evinced in an equally strong and instinctive feel-
ing, which is the absence ofall propensity in an
animal to destroy·its own kind ; even ravenous
wolves under the most pressing hunger travel in
large companies without destroyirig each other.
This shews what the principle and limit of de-
structiveness are in carnivorous animals. Is such
a propensity in any shape allied to the act of
murder committed by man ~ He, in common
with many other animals, has the carnivorous
appetite implanted in his nature, and in' lieu of
certain destructive corporeal weapons, is gifted
with other powers for a similar end. With these
natural feelings and endowments, and with the
additional express permission that all living crea-
tures should minister to his wants, and be to him
for meat, destructiveness is in him also an allow-
able, legitimate principle ; but from his instinctive
repugnance to destroy and devour his own kind,
consonant with that of all other animals, and
from his having reeeived an e.xpres1 prohilnl:Um

aga.insl the s'Mdding man's blood; murder be;.
comes an unnatural, unlawful, and wicked deed;
bearing not the most distant affinity to destruc-
tiveness.
I have already adduced reasons to account for
a greater width of head from ear to ear, in car·
nivorous than in graminivorous animals, and one
proof of theirjustness is, that they shew an adaP6
ta.tion ofmeans to ends ; but no arguments are
brought to convince us, that the portion of brain
over each ear, gives the impulse or disposition to
destroy life.
Judging from all Creation, from that harmony,
perfection, and good, which pervade the structure
ofevery individual creature, I can never suppose
God to be the Author of any evil work ; and
therefore infer that he never created in any man's
brain, an organ which would prompt or impel
him to murder a fellow-creature. Neither am I
so uncharitable, as to think that Phrenologists
seriously entertain a different opinion ; but when
we pereeive the two functions of destructiveness
and murder embodied in the same organ; and
when we know that Phrenologists believe that
the carnivorous animals destroy others in con•
sequence of having this organ, and that those
which have it not, do not destroy life ; bowcan
we entirely divest our minds of the idea that
murder is committed upon a similar prinei·
pl-e, and likewise that the doctrine ·of F~.

tnakes a component of their system. They deny,
however, the charge of Fatalism, and say, that
Phrenology contains no suchviews. They wish to
be understood as speaking only of the powe;rs <Yr
.organs, and not oftheir application, saying, that
" good and bad cannot be applied to the powers
themselves, but to their actions."• They admit
innate powers, but not irresistibk actions. Let
us examine a few of their expressions, and see
whether good and bad qualities are not attached
to the organs ; whether their applications are not
virtually, ifnotformally admitted; also, whether a
necessity for those actions is notimplied, and free
agency, either directly or indirectly subverted. '
Some oftheirorgans are called superior,higher,
and more noble, unquestionably importing good;
such are Veneration, Benevolence, and Conscien·
tiousness. Others again are termed inferior, igno-
ble, base, which must mean bad; these are De-
structiveness, Combativeness, & Acquisitiveness,
or the obtaillll1:ent of any thing upon·earth in an
honest or dishonest way. " I never (says Dr.
Spurzheim) choose for my intimate friends ·per-
sons inwhom the inferi<YT' organs are very large,
and the superior very small."t These terms
indicate the admission ofgood and bad powers or
organs. I would also observethatall their organs

were derived from and f<YUnded on some swppo-
aed function, and the distinguishing epithets of
good and badhave been applied to these. Ifthen
a function be bad, its organ or representative
cannot be good. " A Tree is known by its fruits.u
Was not the organ of murder founded on the
function or propensity to destroy life, and has not
this been admitted by Phrenologists to be in ma-
ny respects low, base, and bad, ergo the organ
must be low, base and bad : for did the organ it-
selfalways remain quiet, inactive, and unproduc-
tive, then I should esteem it inert and inopera-
tive, consequently useless, neither good nor bad;
but when declared prone to act in all the vile
ways which have been described, we must justly
consider it a bad organ, from its functions being
bad, in which all that is worthless or valuable
essentially resides.
The mind ofman is applied in a great variety
ofways, principally to the impelling and direct-
ing the corporeal organs or instruments accord-
ingly as it wills. This impelling agency is
granted by Phrenologists to their several facul-
ties, more especially to the Propensities.• Thus

sitiveness to beg, borrow, steal, or gain by honest
means-and Destructiveness to kill. Here then
is diStinctly an application oforgansto particular
purposes.
Let us now examine whether their language
does not go far'to demonstrate irresistibility of
action.
"Ifany being has only one power, he acts in
one way and can have no c/wi,ce.''• This clear-
ly indicates a determinate undivided action in
any power, similar to what obtains in the eye,
ear, stomach, liver, &c.; which ifexercised at
all, must be in one specific way, and unexercised
is useless, and might as well not exist. Apply
this rt>..asoning to the brain ofman, which Phre-
nologists have divided into many powers, each
having a distinct and different function : must
not each act in its own way and have no choice '?
Ofwhat benefit would the organs of Veneration·
and Benevolence be, if they did not prompt us

to the exercise of devotion, and the shewing
kindness one towards another '? Could other or-
gans perform their functions '? or could they
officiate for Combativeness or Destructiveness '?
seeing that " every faculty is confined to its own
organ."* An eye is notexpected to digest food,
nor a stomach to see; either of them may be at
rest, but when employed, it must be each in its
proper function, and brainular organs beingcon-
sidered analogous in having special faculties, we
should expect each, when in action, to perform
its own duty. Dr. Spurzheim further says, " It
is beyond a doubt, that he who is dragged into
criminal actions by very strong internalpr<Ypen-
S'ities, rarely feels any natural repentance. In
such a man, the inclinations which lead to evil
are energetic : they constitute, if I may so ex·
pressmyself, his principal character; and hence
all his actions which result from them are in
harmony with his inclinations."f In this para-
graph we perceive the actual appli,cation ofpro-
pensities, expressed in the strong language of
forcing or dragging a person into wicked acts,
and which certainly bears more the character of
necessity than choice of action, in addition to
which, the Doctor afterwards mentions it as a
circumstance generally known, "that every one

excuses his frailties, by saying, it is my nature;
itis stronger than I am, I cannot help it ;"• and
when speaking ofthe necessity of artists imita-
ting nature in theirconfigurations ofheads in por-
trait painting, he applies this unhappy expres-
sion, " Do you suppose, that if an artist were to
represent a person he intended to be sentto hea-
ven, and anotherto be sent to hell, that he would
give them the same shape,d, heads,'?"f Here
likewise is a virtual acknowledgement, that·good
and evil actions, are dependent on, and must
proceed from certain configurations of the head,
a knowledge being implied ofthe precise form
which is likely to send a person either to heaven
or hell. Lest the language of Phrenologists,
already adverted·to, should not be considered
sufficiently·demonstrative of an irresistibk ac-
tion, I adduce two more quotations, in which it
appears still more palpable. When speaking of
the organofdestructiveness DrSpurzheim assures
us that, " In man this propensity presents diffe-
rent degrees ofactivity, from a mere indifference
to the pain of animals, to the pleasure of seeing
them killed, or even to the mostirresistibk tkswe
to ki/,l. This doctrine may shock sensibility, butit
is notthe less truef" "Aperson endowed with the
faculties proper to man in the highest degree,

and with very small animal faculties, will act by
natwre conf<YTWUJJk to the faculUes which give
the law when the animal faculties act with
energy. He has no occasion for any law,
either putting in action the superior faculties, or
preventing the abuses ofhisanimal faculties, and
is really elect."•
I wish my readers to judge with candour and
impartiality ofthe precedingquotations, and say
whether the quality and application of organs,
are not plainly evinced in their pages; also whe-
ther the doctrine ofnecessity or fatalism is not
promulgated by this modern exposition of the
human understanding. Let us not be lulled into
any ideal security that it is not, merely because
we are told so, when a little investigation will
discover ample evidence, tendingto subvert free
agency, and fritter away the whole principle of
moral responsibility.
This isthe system which is now preachedabroad,
and held up to public view as the perfection of
mental philosophy. By its loose but dogmatic
rules do the Phrenologists desire education to
be conducted, institutions to be formed, and so-
ciety to modelled. So long as it employed men's
minds theoretically only, as a curious and amu-
sing speculation, no great mischief arose, but

the crime oftheft, that " as it exists, it was not
against the will ofthe Crea.t.or,"* mustinevitably
apply to murder and other crimes, than which
nothing can be more erroneous and revolting.
We know that God does, for some wise purpose,
permit the commission of crime, but he never
wills nor sanctions even the least. The willing
and pennitting an act are totally different. The
former attaches itself most intimately to an act
by desiring it ; whilst.the latter has no necessary
connexion with it, and may be even averse to it,
yet aJ,l<no its perpetration.
Is it possible to look with apathy and in·
difference, upon a wide diffusion of such princi-
ples, which not only tend to excite great suspicion
and distrust among society, but to throw off the
yoke ofmoral responsibility 'I Beingacted upo~
in one department oflife, it may be expected to
extend its operation through every other, civil,

will venture to predict that interminable dis-
trust, discord, and confusion, would ·be the un·
happy consequences.

Spurzheim mingles many sensible observations
with numerous fanciful and impracticable rule.s,

eighteen hundred years, or he never would have
said, that " many books have been written on
education, whole libraries have been compiled,
various institutions established, yet very litt'le im-
provementhas takenplace."• Accordingto this
sentiment, the. whole intellectual world has hi-
therto been nearly at a stand still; but now, that
Phrenology is brought into existence, and redu-
ced to a complete system, '!e are taught to anti-
cipate the most brilliant success. All mankind
must begin ~ novo, make it their polar star, and
pursue every branch of literature, art, and sci-
ence, under its splendid and unerring.light.
In the Doctor's exordium upon education, he
throws out hints in an unconnected way, on
the principles and doctrine of propagation in
improving the breeds of cattle, plants, trees, and
fruits, by attendi~ to certain conditions ; and af-
terwards intimates that the intellectual as well as
corporeal conditioilll ofman may be improved by
similar attentions. He observes, that " If the
time snould come when the laws of propagation
shall be attended to, more good will be done to
perfect man, than hitherto has been done by all
the institutions, and by all the. teachers of the

eases· which descend from one generation to
another, andof promotinga vigorous and healthy
body ; hence so far I heartily concur. with Dr.

tain improvement ofintellect, and likewise, that
by a nice attention to phrenologicalrules, we may
judge accurately of the presence ofsuch superior
mental manifestations ; I must begleave to d.Hfer
from him upon the following grounds.
First. Because we are every day witnessing
genius and very strong minds in conjunction
with deformed and unhealthy bodies, of which
fact, our two distinguished poets, Pope and Cow-
per are · striking examples: also great precocity
oftalent in very rickety, unhealthy children ; and
conversely men ofthe mostsymmetrical frames,
sound health, and herculean bodily powers, with-
out any strength of understanding, or with a very
moderate share.
Secoruily. Because children are frequently
much inferior in abilities to their parents--and
ThirdJ,y. Because we are not in possession
ofany true phrenological index to guide us : be-
lieving that its outward signs and internal divi-
sionofbrain intospecificorgans, are all conjecture
and da~k uncertainty.
At the same time I will not attempt to disprove
that clever children may and often do proceed
from clev~r parents, yet that we are not to rely
on it as a necessary consequence.•
• Since we seldom, if ever, hear of Idiots marrying, I may
instance them in illustration of Parents with aonnd miDcla of-

In a highly civilized and dense population,
among whom disease bas found entrance in a
thousand different enervating forms, and from as·
many different causes, obstacles are continually
presenting themselves to counteract those whole-
some regulations which would conduce to physi-
cal perfection; and ifto these are to be added a
host ofothers, arising from phrenological views
of the human mind, mankind will become so
surrounded with difficulties that they will scarce-
ly know how to form proper matrimonial con-
nexions.
Were phrenological rules once recognized as
applicable to propagation, we should find both
ladies and gentlemen very particular in their
choice of partners, often very whimsical, and
more nice than wise respecting mental endow-
ments. As it is not yet proved to demonstration
.that a wise father and mother shall be sure of
having even a sensible child, much more an im-
proved offspring, or that parents possessing the
organ of tune, colour, ideality, or causality, shall
give birth to a Handel, a Titian, a Milton, or a
Newton ; I suspect there would be many castles
built in the air, many high expectations formed,
and but few realised.
I do not impugn the motive which has actua-
ted Phrenologists in endeavouring to extend the
laws of propagation fu mind ; I believe it to be
pure and commendable, because it certainly aims

means of attaining this _
whichI oqject; as be~ng
fanciful, imaginary, and without any sdlid ba&is,
therefore delusive, worthless, and dangerous·.
It is, ot ought to be, unquestionably a p8?8-
mount object in every nation to preserve a vigo-
rous and healthy race ofsubjeets; which we know
may be promoted by certain lawsand institutions,
the chiefofwhich is the ordination of matrimony,
intended in part to guard againstinter-marriages
oftoo close a consanguinity. This is of a public
nature, but there are many considerations ofa
private kind, to which it would be wise in indivi-
duals to pay more attention t~an_ is generally
done. I allude to the contracting of marriage
in familie8, where insanity or other hereditary
diseases of a very fatal tendency are known to
prevail, and which are not unfrequently entailed
upon generations. These circumstances having
been duly weighed, the unmarried lady and gen-
tleman may endeavour to obtain as great a con-
geni~ty of tastes, aentiments, habits, education,
ai;id ral)k in society as they please, the m_ore the
better: but to be paying and receiving·addresses
phrenologically, eyeing, feeling,,andscrutinizing
each other's heads, in order to discover whether
certain faculties are well ' developed, and'a mu-
tuality of sentiment existing, so as to guarantee
much connubial felicity, would be, to say the
least of it, very absurd.

Bring this system into general Use, and all

The reason for giving this caution to the fair,
respecting the angry man, is, because Dr. Spurz-
heim tells us that " at Spandaw we (meaning
himself and Gall) saw a man who had assassina-
ted his wife in a paroxysm of anger; and this
man was unhappy during his whole life. Indeed
he was a good natured and generally considered
as an honest man."• Although therefore we are
again and again assured that a person having a
lower organ is not obliged to make use of it to a
bad purpose, yet this is poor consolation, when

we see it so rapidly and violently excited by an
ger, even in a " goodnaturedman " as to induce
him to commit the deepest criminal act.
After eulogizing the benefits which would ac·
crne to mankind, by attending to the laws of
propagation, both in mind and body, Dr. Spurz·
heim affords us a very equivocal and unsatisfac-
tory rule to accomplish those ends. He says,
'' A villain does not like to see an honest man,
and a just man does·not like to see one that is
unjust. Every one must know his own powers,
and he must look for the same powers in another,
and then suchpersonswill live inpeace."• What,
pray, would this effect towards producing a ge-
neral improvement among mankind '? It would
undoubtedly, ifpracticahle, be separating the
just from the wijust, the wise from the foolish,
the wheat from the chaff, i,tnd although improve-
ment in wisdom, goodness, and happiness, may
possibly be progressive in one class; degenera-
tion in vice, folly, and misery would be equally
progressive in the other. Superior organs mar-
ried to superior, may live in peace; but inferior
united with inferior, would, by the same rule,
live in discord. If great improvement of the
human mind, is to be placed on a footing with
that of breeding cattle, similar regulations ought
to be strictly pursued. Many physical points of

what their cranial developements would lead us
to expect, as in the case of Infanticide by the

this lamentable infirmity, or of the causes which

will notbe difficult to shew that the very princi..

also with Conscientiousness, Pride,t Benevo-

ence from which must be, that largely developed
brains are rrwre prone to become insane, conse-
quently the very rule which Phrenologists advise
for increasing intellect, namely an union of fully
developed powers, (in orderto ensure a similar or
increased size ofthem) goes to augment the pre-
disposition to insanity. The two extremes then
appear to have their attendant disadvantages.
Very small brains are either idiotic, or very dull
and not susceptible of great mental improve-
ment; and very large have capacities for the
highest intellectual, moral and religious attain·
ments, but unfortunately are more liable to be.

small; thereby ensuring sufficient talent to an-
swer all the purposes of life, and at the same
time diminish our liability to insanity.
If Phrenology be so essentially important in
unravelling the causes, and in determining the
precise seats of insanity ; ·likewise in bringing
this malady to a more speedy and happy termi-
nation, why, for humanity's sake, have not some
eminent Phrenologists afforded the world a prac-
tical proofof it, by establishing Lunatic Asylums
upon their own system, and thereby given us ex-
amples ofits superior value '?
When medical men behold Phrenologists sure
and unerring, or even eminently successful in cu-
ring the different species of insanity, and other
diseases ofthe brain, under the guidance of their
art; when also by the application oftheir prin-
ciples, education shall assume a decided improve-
ment, and produce a striking augmentation of
intellect, I am sure that they will not withhold
their meed of praise, but will press forward, one
and all, to hail with joy so great a blessing, and
bestow every honor upon itsdiscoverers : for then
may they expect to see old heads upon young
shoulders, England one great modern Athens ;
