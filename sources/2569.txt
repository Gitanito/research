PREFAC E. «
The following Tables are calculated according to
the present obliquity of the ecliptic, 23° 28', and
are adapted for persons who may desire to calculate
a nativity upon the modern and improved rules of
Astrology, as set forth in the latest elementary work
on Genethliacal Science, the Grammar of Astro-
logy.
The Table of Houses for the latitude of London
51° 32 N., contains the Right Ascension of every
degree of the zodiac in hours, minutes, and seconds.
The Table of Houses for the latitude of Liverpool,
53° 23' N., contains the Right Ascension of every
degree of the zodiac in degrees and minutes of a
degree ;
therefore, by referring from one to the
other of these Tables, the student will at once perceive
what is the Right Ascension in degrees and minutes
of any amount of time within the 24 hours, and
vice versa. The former of these Tables will answer
for any part of Great Britain which is south of the
2T PREFACE.
latitude of 52 degrees and a half ;
and the latter
Table will answer equally well for anyplace between
Liverpool and the borders of Scotland. The im-
portance of this Table, which has cost the Author
great labour, as it required the taking out 12,600
logarithms, will be instantly perceived, when it is
considered that the longitude of the ascendant at
Liverpool is sometimes three degrees different from
the longitude of the ascendant at London. The errors
that arose from erecting figures of the heavens for
the northern parts of the kingdom by means of the
Table of Houses for London, must have been very
great. Even in horary questions it is very im-
portant to have the longitude of the ascending degree
correct ;
and in nativities an error of three degrees
would throw out a secondary direction of the Moon
to any aspect of the ascendant not less than three
months
;
and so create error and confusion in the
judgment of events. As, for example, if the primary
directions were such as to denote danger of drown-
ing, and the Moon came to an opposition of the as-
cendant in the secondary direction, it might be judged
that the greatest danger would be during the week
when the Moon came exactly to the opposite degree

and minute of those which were ascending at birth ;
but if the ascendant were wrong, even by one degree,
this time could not be ascertained to within a month.
To persons who can erect a figure by trigonometry,
it is of less importance ;
but this is seldom done for
horary questions.
The Table of Right Ascensions contains only
twelve pages instead of twenty-four, as usual, but
the extra expense of twelve additional pages is avoid-
ed by this means ;
and it only requires to pay strict
attention to the direction at the head of each page,
and either add or subtract 180°, as may be required
thus, if the Right Ascension of 10 degrees of Scorpio
with 3 degrees of South latitude be required, learn by
the table what is the Right Ascension of the opposite
point of the zodiac, viz. 10 degrees of Taurus with
3 degrees of opposite latitude, and then add 180
degrees, and you have the Right Ascension required.
Thus, Right Ascension of 10° 8 with 3° North
latitude 36° 35'
To which add half the circle 180 0
And you have the Right Asc. of 10° rq
with 3° South latitude 216 35
VI PREFACE.
Again,, if you require the Right Asc. of 5 deg. of
Aries with 2° South latitude, find that of the opposite
point, viz. 5 deg. of with 2° North latitude ;
which is 185° 22' by the Table ;
and by taking away
the half circle, 180°, you have 5° 22' for the Right
Ascension you require.
The latitudes in these Tables are carried only to
7 degrees, which is the utmost any planet reaches,
except Venus. When those rare occasions happen
in which Venus is found with latitude exceeding 7
degrees, it will be very easy to see what difference of
Right Asc. or Declination one degree of latitude
creates opposite the longitude of Venus, and then
compute the difference of her Right Asc. &c. As,
for example, if Venus be in 20 degrees of Virgo,
with 8 degrees and a half of North latitude, and I
require her Right Asc., the difference of Right Asc.
between 6 degrees and 7 degrees of North latitude,
opposite 20 degrees of Virgo, is just 24 minutes of
a degree ;
therefore to the Right Asc. under the 7th
degree, which is 173° 37', I add 24 min., and it
gives 174° 1/ for the Right Asc. of Venus, with 8
degrees of North lat. opposite 20 rt%
;
and for the
PREFACE. Vll
half degree I add 12 min. more, and it gives 174° 13',
the Right Asc. of Venus in 20° and 8° 30' North
latitude; and by adding 180° to this, we have
354° 13' for the Right Asc. of Venus if she had
been in 20° x with 8° 30' of South latitude.
On some rare occasions the Moon’s declination
will exceed 28°, the limits of our Table of Ascensional
Difference ;
but the difference between 27° and 28°
being found, and the proportion allowed for the next
degree, it will give the Asc. Diff. of the Moon suffi-
ciently near. For example, the Moon’s declination
at noon on the 17th February, 1806, was 28° 12';
required her Asc. Diff. in latitude 55° ? The differ-
ence between 27° and 28° of declination is 2° 43' of
Asc. Diff. in that high latitude ;
then say, if one de-
gree gives 2° 43' — 163 minutes, what will 12
minutes give ? Answer, 33 minutes ;
which, added,
to 49° 24', the Asc. Diff. for 28° declination, gives
the Asc. Diff. required, viz. 49° 57'.
The great interest evinced in the examination of
Astrology in the present age, as shewn by the ready
sale of a large edition of the “ Grammar of Astrology,”
has induced the Author to put forth these Tables ;
by
Till PREFACE.
which means still farther facility is offered to those
persons whose sense of the value of experience will
induce them to place more reliance on one fact than
on a hundred crude arguments,, or a thousand idle
assertions. Feeling that the question of the truth or
falsehood of Astrology has never been discussed in
the present day by such arguments as science would
acknowledge* the Author has no hesitation in de-
claring* that ignorance of its principles and practice
is the chief foundation of the prejudice which exists
against the science ;
and he trusts that these Tables
will assist to overcome much of that ignorance* and
thereby overthrow one obstacle in the path of
truth.

A perfect acquaintance with the Local History and internal Advantages of
oar Native Country is certainly one of the most useful, ornamental, and desirable
branches of human knowledge; and it will readily be admitted that there is not
a nation in the world more generally interesting to the scientific observer than
that of Great Britain.
COOKE’S TOPOGRAPHICAL LIBRARY forms a complete PICTRE of the
BRI TISH EMPIRE, and contains a particular Account of the
Situation,
Extent,
Towns,
Roads,
Rivers,
Lakes,
of all the Counties in England, Wales, and Scotland; the whole interspersed
with a variety of Information, entertaining to the general Reader—highly
beneficial to the Agriculturist, Trader, and Manufacturer—and particularly
interesting to the Traveller, Speculatist, Antiquarian, and, in short, to every
Man of the World.
The Work is highly illustrated with a complete Series of County Maps, accu-
rately Coloured, and Embellished with upwards of Three Hundred Picturesque
Views of Towns, Castles, Churches, Cathedrals, Natural Curiosities, Noblemen’s
and Gentlemen’s Seats, Druidical Remains, &c. &c.
The division of the Work into separate Counties affords great accommodation
to the Public, in selecting such portions as may be wished; thus the Western
Circuit of England comprehends Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wilts, and
Hants, and forms Four interesting Volumes. The other Five Circuits of the
Judges may be selected and bound up in the like manner.
To each County are prefixed a List of the Markets anil Fairs, an Index,
shewing the Distance of every Town from London, and of Towns from each other:

“ An Essay, and an Historical Notice of the Rise and progressive Improvement of this mighty
vapour power, has been just published, which may be considered the most complete account of it that
has yet proceeded from the press, inasmuch as it not only traces back its origin, but examines and
describes all the various discoveries that have been made up to the present moment, with the view of
further developing its almost infinite capabilities. The author of this work is Mr. Alderson, Civil
Engineer ;
and for it he received the Prize last year from the Mechanics’ Institute. It is not difficult
to conceive that he merited such a distinction, for he takes a very clear view of his subject, and
explains himself with scientific lucidness and intelligibility, although with unaffected simplicity.
The question regarding the expediency of establishing Rail-Roads and Steam-Carriages to run on
the common highway he discusses with much impartiality. At the present moment, such a work,
and its dimensions are very moderate, should be generally consulted.”

“ This is unquestionably the most practical work on the subject in our language, and the informa-
tion is conveyed in plain and intelligible terms. The convenience of a small poultry-yard ;
two or
three pigs, wilha breeding sow, and a cow tor cream, milk, hatter, and cheese*, i‘n an

English
country-house, appears indispensable ;
and to point out how these may be obtained, at a reasonable
expense, seems to have been Mr. Moubray’s object. He is evidently a good practical farmer tho-
roughly conversant with rural economy in all its brandies; his boo'k is written in a li»i!t fively
Kitchener style; and, like the works of that celebrated gastronome, conveys, at least” as much
amusement as information. Were any testimony wanted as to its practical utility, it* would be
found in the declaration of an eminent rural economist, Sir John Sinclair, who pronounces it ‘ the
best work hitherto printed’ on the subject of which it treats. It is particularly calculated for the
Colonies, Canada, and United States, the West Indies, New South Wales, and Van Dieman’s Land.**

“ As a book of daily reference the FAMILY CY CLOPiEDIA is really invaluable;
it forms a portable Library of Useful Knowledge, of easy reference, and contains

and of greater magnitude.”
“ It contains a large mass of information on subjects connected with the Domestic
Economy of Life. In matters of Science and the Arts, the selections are all from

“ This may be considered as the book of physical Education, and embraces a subject of the highest
importance to every mother. Although the volume appears to have been written en des bouts de temps,
there is, nevertheless, ‘ much method in it;’ and, what is of some importance in a work of this kind,
a degree of freedom, which shows it to have been written, * con amove,’ with a perfect knowledge
of the subject by the author. The duties of a mother and wet-nurse are succinctly and briefly laid
down; and the chapters on the early detection of infantile disease are calculated to afford mnch
valuable information on points of vital importance to the young. A philosophic and Christian spirit
breathes through the work : and there are none who are, or who are likely to become mothers, but
will be interested in its contents ;
we therefore cordially recommend it to all ‘ sorts and conditions’
