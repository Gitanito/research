note attached to the prophecy in the fecond edition
of The Strange Effeftsof .Faith, yhere you will find
that the Spirit which infpired tod di&ated this pro.
phecy, was Joanna’s own judgment*
When I read this prophecy in the firft edition, 1
very much (tumbled at it, (fpr in that edition-there
Is no-fuels marginal bet *thc ^iebmcy is
recorded as dictated by the Spirit like all tne reft) ;
for it being mantfeft that the prophecy had failed, I
was fure it was not dictated by the Spirit of Gpd*
But wbei> I found by the marginal notc in thefjaoond
Edition, that Joanna confeffed it g^me from her pwm
judgment, I was very angry, being three faTUvCftfV}

ftitute it a djWok prof>hciy, as xhbehas any one pro*

of prophecy is no other than
Own judgment; and this is exa&ty the fame as our.

* I believe the reader h a little incenfed as well as

{ball go on. and endeavour, by more prophecies, to
convince him that my anger is not without a caufe.

From this prophecy we learn, firft, that the fulfil-1
ment ot the prophecies was fo (anguinely expend
in 1804* 6° particular, was the time ExesL, that
tj*ebelievers were almoft certainof the day and hour*:
Secondly, that the ihadows were all to end in 1804,
aad the fuoftsnce mpft aSuredly to be in .the next
year* But, iyhat» let me elk, what in the name o t
God did there happen in 1804 and 1805, that in any
fenfe anfwered to the prophecy?. Reader, how can
you for a moment, think of thefe bkfphcmous lies,
that this abominable woman placesto God’s account?
how can you think of it, without feeling the greateft
indignation ? Was 1 not angry at fuch blafphemy, I
believe God would be angry with me*

All thefe prophecies undeniably teftity that awful
judgments would take place in 1804, but yet that
thele would be but the (hadow of what would
happen in the two'following years, when the dread­
ful fubftance would be fare to come* 1 (hall now

• Thefe prophecies fromThe StrangeEffc&sof Faith,
were evidently intended by the Spirit, (if any fpirit
concerned), and expe&ed by Joanna to take place
yery foon after they were given, which was in 179a*
and the years following; and it cannot be denied
but that the frequent occurrence of the word mow,
and the term at ha nd, in a great many of Joanna's
prophecies of the Millenium, plainly indicate, that
it was expc&ed, and intended to take place immedi­
ately, One prophecy more of this kind from the

Now I am very fure that every reader of thefe pro­
phecies, diip fed to fpeak the truth, will own that
they have every one of them literally failed: and
every one that does not own it. and (hew his con­
tempt of every fuch falfe prophet, evinces that he
has no regard either for truth, or its Divine Author,
A zeal for God and truth is a duty enjoined all
men even by nature, and can no more be negle&ed
with impunity, than the duties ofjuftice and mercy.

this, (in(lead of tolerating indifference) demands,at­

The prophecy therefore is without meaning, of
the events of the winter were not the beginning ef
the judgments.
Not only fn, but the judgments do not come on as
feported, and expe&ed: they were to come on in
the moft rapid manner, and were to inereafe with
the months and weeks, but this they do not; and I
have every reafon to believe, from the manner of the
fealed people, that they are verv much afraid and
apprehenfive, that they fhail again be duped-
in order to perfuade the people, that the .judg­
ments are coming on, the newfpapers are kept and
ranfacked; the calamities of different nations and
different times, are collected together, ana fet forth
in a mafs, with ftrong emphafis, and terrific ahimad-
Verfions, by which artifice, the people's ex peftai ions
lire kept alive; but I am much inclined tothinx, that
the fealed people will more and more find them*
fclves difappointed.
There is a prophecy or twb in fh*e book bf The
Trial, which I think is likely enough, inTbfne
fure, to be fulfilled, viz. that Joanna will (fbttfe
iime or other) be tried by the civil "power. Thft

Joanna was, according t >her prophecies (or ra-

pretended Trial, in 1804% at Bermrtfidfey ; for that
Trial was predifted as well as that which is dill ex-

fi in anyrefpeft as foretold. *
She was to have been in a trance then, and Mrs.
Beacraft bought oil and flannel {in confequence of

up ; as you wfllAnd inthe book of The Trial, page

to be fulfilled, Joanna (finding it not quite fo eafy

be agitated; as you may fee., with a little 'difcern-

and delufion.
This anfwer of the Spirit, in the firft inftance,
proves him to be a changeable being. In was the

knowledge of the prefent ftateof things, from which
it is fometimes more likely to prtdi& the truth than

'Ip conclude, it plainly appears.that Joanna’s pro- *
phecies, for the moft part, have failed; tiSat her af- :
cribing fuch prophecies tothe unerring Spirit of Ood'^ •-
is the greateft blafphetmy; and that, they moft have
proceeded from her own judgment, qr from the devilj

. even owning that they have feveral times been de­
ceived ! It is a general max m with other people, if
a man deceives me once, I will not trud him again ;
but the friends of Joanna, though deceived feveral
times already, dill catch and hold fail the enfpared
bait, in fpite of every remondrance.
The bait,' I fay, is dill held out, and the people
are dill deluded. The awful and drange events that
were to take place in 1805, *806, and 1807, ^ °9 ***
now to be in 1810, and 1811, when England is to bc
fully redeemed, and made completely happy.
Thus the people are towed on from one time to
another; ana the running after Joanna’s prophecies
is like purfuing one’s own ihadow, that can never '
be caught.
Joanna's fcheme in proceeding thus is very difeem-
able. She knows.very well it is a delufion, and ihe
knows that ihe mud keep it up as long as ihe lives,
or fall a prey to the people’s fury, which ihe very
much dreads, and not without reafon. This evil ihe
thinks ihe ihall efcape, if ibe can (by the opium o f
her witchcraft) keep the people’s minds in a date of
infatuation, till the end of her days, and Which from
her great fuccefs in deceiving, ihe is perhaps in fome
hopes of doing: 1 fay, from her great fuccefs; for the
people have been deceived more than once; the
things that are dill looked for, were prophecied of
in 1792' and were expefted to take place immediate­
ly :— then in ten years. This will be evident to any
one that will take the book, called The Strange
Effe&s o f Faith, and read firft, in page 145, next 70,
then 37, and lad 34, and this is corroborated alfo by
that prophecy mentioned above, and to be found in
in page 128 of Strange EffeQsof Faith, “ It is s a id

the fealed people that have the leal of fafetv, faf
it is calle'd) are to be defended from thofe dreadful
calamities, thus— About one week pteviou* tothofb

which has confefledly fometimes beegi the cafe.
The fealed people are then* to leave their homes to
the protection of providence, till the height of thb
trouble is over, when they are to return, and find
every thirffif as they left it. While Joanna and her
people are thus depaiting from the feene of .trouble
to a place of fafety, they are to fee ten thoufand fall
on their right hand, and on thein left. . j
1i was n*>t known till *807 that the fealed people
wodld He favoured with their mother, to lead them
away; for fhe was expe&ed in that year to.have died,
as haying but fifteen years added to her life in 179*;
~but when ihe fifteen years were expired, and fhe did
not did, fhe thought pfoper to have a communica­
tion, importing that fhe was toliVetofoadher follow-

had died at the time appointed, it would have been
a greater proof to me that her caufe was good, than
her living to lead the people forth ; while, her not
dying at the time appointed, proves her vifiiing
Spirit to be a changeable being, and (he herfelf to be
guilty of blafphemy, in robbing God of his immuta­
bility.
} ' Thofe of Joanna’s followers that choofe to wait a
little longer, to fee once more the event of the pro­
phecies, before they will decide on her miflionr will

The fealed people will then begin to work m*racks,
and many will go from England into all other coun­

to work miracles, and relate what the l ord has done

Next year Buonaparte is to land in England, and
to be put to death by the fealed people. As for
Joanna, (he is to die before the very heavy judg­
ments of all comettti, not bemgable to bear them*
Now the reader will obfervfe, that according to
thefe accounts (of which Joanna is the author) there '
is a great deal to be done in a little time; the fword,
peftilence, and famine mail go through the land.
Joanna mud lead the people from the feene of trou­
ble to a fafe retreat. After they return, Joanna’s
awful trial is to come on, when (to prevent her re­

were to have been fulfilled in 1807, that being the

remains vet to prevent its downfall, I mail leave for
the believers to determine. The principal fupport.

Secondly, we find Joanna characterized in verfe

cejving, infomuch, that If it were pollible, the very

Joanna’sfollowers will be ready to own that if fire is a

that fhe bears an unblfcmifhed chavafter; that flie

Now. it should be particularly noticed, that false prophet* .

artful, they cannot deceive mahy, aod unless they have every

word) such false prophets must route, that are exceedingly art­
ful, and yft appear to be.perfectly simple, and without any art-
fulness at a ll: then Joanna’*simplicity is no argument, that the
Is a true prophet.
. f t will be demanded—Ifofalse prophets are thus artful and
deceiv:ng; by what means are they to be distinguished from
true prophets ? Towhich, Mat. vii. Id, is a proper answer. Ye
shall know them by their fruit. Now let ns apply this teat to
Joanna. If all her fruit corresponded with her soliciting for a
trial* aitd investigation, it would be very well; but It does n e t:
for several have investigated, and have endeavoured to convince
her, that her visitation was .not of God: but she has treated
their endeavours with scurriliity and ridicule. I remember read­
ing in Joanna's writings, that when she received, from an un­
known friend, a .letter that pointed out her faults and danger*
riie observes, that she and her friends made themselves merry on
the occasion. 1 have observed already, that In the midst of
laughter, the heart is sorrowful: here let me add, and the end
of that mirth is heaviness. Although Joanna pretended, that she
wished to have her writings investigated and proved; yet by ,
her using every one ill that opposed her, itwps evident, that what
she really wished for was not to have her writing proved,
but approved. As for th° Rev. Mr. Pomrov, her own ac­
count of her conduct towards him deserves the greatest ridi­
cule : she informs us, that he was chosen of God to beher judge ;
that the Lord gave liim five talents of wisdom on purpose to
qualify him for that important office; that he did this with con­
summate wisdom, and paternal fillings: yet, notwithstanding
all this, she rejected hisjudgment, because lie did not believe her
calling was of God. This, together with her three trials, proved
to a demonstration, that it was not an impartial investigation she
wanted, but a flattering approbation. Now these fruits are
neither grapes nor figs, but the genuine marks of a false prophet.
Thirdly, I am inclined to think, that Joanna a little corres­
pond* with what is said of false prophets, Matt. vii. 15. Beware
f f false prophets, who come to you in jbeep’s clothing, but

Inwardty; thrr*fe ravening wolves. That Joanna torn** fn *
sheep’* clothing, on one will deny; and as she is very fond of *
receiving presents, and also that help which the earth bestows on
.the women* she might be said to answer, in some degree, the det«
vripiion in tW latter part of the verse, as well asthe former,
I mnst now draw to a conclusion,'
When my Friendly Address came out, assoon as Joanna had
read it, a command was‘
given, that the sealed people should not
purchase i t ; and a desire expressed, Unit they would out read
it,-but at Mr. Field’s, This despotic command, and mean*
spirited desire; was, in general, most religious^ attended to
though, 1 am inclined to think, that some were naughty enough
to smuggle*little* having, perhaps, the presumption to think*
tbqt they were capable of judging for themseWe?; and also ‘
that, peradventure, jeanna might not be St, -Peter’s successor,
althongb she peted with papal authority, 1
- Whether this Book of Prophecies wiW share the same fete, I ,
know* not * but I am constrained to say, that that command v
proceeded front the most illiberal principle. It ttas an act o f
injustice to me, and tui insult to the believers, as it is evidently
implied, that they had not senseenough to judge fer themselves j
while the people who yielded to it that obedience so unjustly r e -',
gaiied, manifested the most slavish vassalage and contemptiblt
duplicity.
‘On Joanna’s part ft was ah evident proof that her cunningly*
deyfsed fable would not bear .the light, npd that her professed
approbation of free enquiry, and willingness to have her, cause
investigated, was nothing but hypocrisy.
For the leaders of sects to fetter the liberty of their follower*,
and hinder their acquaintance with the arguments of their oppo- *
neats, is mean* unjust*and derogatory to every libera! sentiment, .
I have now made It manifeft, that Joannais a falfe
prophet; and obferve, alhatjoever doth make manifejb,
is light. Eph. v. 13, Obferve'again, Every or^t
that doeth evily hatetkthe light, neither cometh he to t&*

AS it has been surmised, that one of the sealed people assists n#
in my proceedings against Joanna, much to the prejudice of the
' person en>pected ; this is to certify, that there is not a person
existing to whom a single sentence in my writings is known, tilt
the last word is written 5 neither would my pride allow me to
make use of any such aid ; what I do, I do single-handed ; har­
ing ntfvassistance from any person, of any kind whatever, except
my little boy 5 who, when I have finished my writings, looks it
over to correct the spelling. This being all the correction the
writings receive ; if there should be any imperfection in the dic­
tion, the generous reader will bury it in the importance of the
subject. I present myself to the public, not as literary character,
but an advocate for truth, and an opposer of delusion : and if l
succeed in this, I am well satisfied. As for Joanna’s cause, I am
convinced it is a delusion of the first magnitude; and I hare, in
the name of God, and by His assistance, undertaken its ruin, and
that without the least fear of success.
Some of the sealed people are very angry at my proceeding!,
hut this is very inconsistent, as they acknowledge the time they so
much wish for^cannot come till there has been a violent oppose
tion to Joanna’s cause.
N. B. I believe I have brought many prophecies to tight,'
that have not been much noticed. The prejudiced will therefore
take heed to John iii. 19. A nd th is is t h e c o n d em n atio n , t h a t
