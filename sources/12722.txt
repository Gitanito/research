  		              		Experience Description   

        At the time my experience happened, I had been diagnosed with heart trouble. One day when I was standing in the living room, I started not feeling well and collapsed on the floor. I was alone in my apartment.

    While unconscious, I found myself in an empty space. Then I started watching my whole life being reviewed in front of me. The emphasis seemed to be on good and bad events. After the presentation ended, I was asked one question, 'On which side are you?' And I had to choose between the good or the bad side.

    At that moment there was no chance to manipulate the answer. You had to tell the truth. It felt like my soul answered this question. I answered, "I love God with all of me." Then I sent these feelings of love to our Creator. After a moment my soul received Love from the other side! It was so huge that if God's love were the ocean, my love would have been one drop of water. It felt like if I were to have moved any closer to that love, it would have absorbed me!

    This experience was a good lesson for me. I can say now that I know that our Creator is real. I no longer have any doubts.

    I have also experienced other mysterious events. For example, I saw my own birth! I was born in a hospital, and I saw a doctor pulling me out of my mom's body. At that moment, I was holding the cord connecting me to my mom and was fully conscious of what I was doing. As I was being born, I was thinking about what was happening!

    With time, I started seeing people that had left this dimension and sometimes they would ask me to pass messages to their relatives. It is interesting to know that very first time the spirit of a friend of mine asked me to pass a message to her family, I didn't do it. Instead, I asked somebody else to do it. And they didn't do it, although I did not realize it until later.  What happened was that a few days later, my friend's spirit showed up in front of me again while I was sitting in my apartment.  As she was looking at me and I was looking back at her, I understood that her message had not been passed to her family. So I did it the very next day and at from that time on, I have never hesitated to follow through with a request from a spirit. 

    However, this contact with spirits comes at a price. Negative energy used to attack me from time to time. But now I can see them coming, and whenever I do, they get paralyzed. It is a nice feeling to bring fear to fear itself. Another reason for the attacks might be that I am able to heal some people by sending them positive energy. When that is going on, I feel like many needles are touching my hands. Distance doesn't exist. Sometimes it has been shown to me that an ill person is going to die even though the doctors have said that that the person is going to be O.K.

    In one example, I was shown how sickness spreads within a human body. Also, one time I saw a sign that turned out to be an indication that a person was going to commit suicide in a few days. This is what the message looked like to me. My wife, myself and another couple were sitting at a table and all of a sudden the head of our lady-friend seemed to disappear. In place of her head, I saw a human skull. I turned my head away and looked back at the lady.  And I saw the same thing again, lasting a few more seconds. I kept trying to figure out what this might mean.  In a few days, I found out. This lady's cousin had hanged himself in Poland.

    Sometimes although we may know what is going to happen, we cannot change somebody's destiny.
