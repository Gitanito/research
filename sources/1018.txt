George Avetoom Marterus Zorab was born in 1898 in Surabaya in Java, formerly part of the Dutch East Indies. In his early teens his family moved to the Netherlands.

Zorab became interested in spiritism after attending a séance which made a big impression on him.1 &nbsp;He joined the Dutch Society for Psychical Research and in 1932 started experimenting, mainly on spontaneous paranormal phenomena and extrasensory perception with psychotics as subjects. He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1938. He was the first editor of two Spiritualist periodicals, Life after Death and Know Thyself.

Zorab was honorary secretary of the Dutch Society for Psychical Research from 1945 to 1957. In 1956 he was invited by Eileen Garrett to direct her newly founded Parapsychology Foundation European Research Centre at St Paul de Vence, France, occupying the post until 1958.

In the 1950s Zorab came into conflict with WH Tenhaeff, who had been appointed professor of parapsychology at the University of Utrecht and was carrying out experiments with the psychic Gerard Croiset. Zorab criticized what he considered Tenhaeff’s lack of methodological rigour, and dissented from his quantitative approach, preferring qualitative methods. In 1960 he and Jan Kappers, a doctor, founded the Dutch Association for Parapsychology with its own magazine, Spiegel der Parapsychologie, which Zorab edited until his death.

In later life, Zorab ceased experimenting but continued to be active in parapsychology as a writer, critic and popularizer. His books include a study of the nineteenth century medium DD Home, and bibliographies of parapsychology. He also acted as mentor to younger researchers.2

Zorab wrote of his friendships with parapsychologists such as Eric Dingwall, Molly Goldney, Emilio Servadio and Robert Thouless.3 But he often engaged in controversy with them, for instance over his suggestion that paranormal functioning has a biological origin, with which many of his colleagues disagreed.4

Zorab was honoured by the publication of a Liber Amicorum in 1986 that detailed his contributions to psychical research as well as listing his several hundred articles and books.5  Select Publications  Books
