  		              		Experience Description   

    I felt heart-attack pain and went unconscious. I went to surgery right afterwards. 

 Everything was very clear.  I was extremely euphoric, happy and relaxed.  I walked through a tunnel lined with white tiles. At the end of the hallway, there was a bright pink, rectangular light. I was calmly  walking toward it when I awoke to extreme pain from the burning of a defibrillator on my chest.

 I immediately described the experience to the doctor. He said, 'Don't go into the light.' 

The memory still vivid.
