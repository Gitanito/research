what i would like to do now is just do a
an experiment taking you through these
steps that you can then apply to remote
viewing an object in a box
doing the uh emotive listening
doing this with your team
doing
what&#39;s called psychometry where you hold
someone&#39;s object and sense
information about them
there are you know you know that
technique or you hope
this is just going to be a technique but
i&#39;m going to take you carefully and this
is going to seem a little more laborious
than what you actually need to do but
it&#39;s because i want you to understand
the steps
does this make sense
and the process and then you can do it
more and more rapidly so
the idea is you don&#39;t have to do it this
in this detailed and slow away
when you&#39;re in your team or by yourself
but you need to understand what the
steps actually are that lead to
effective
remote viewing on a reproducible
reproducible basis
one other comment is that the reason i
teach this approach rather than some of
the others that
basically tricked the mind
intellectually
a lot of the things the techniques that
are used by
the military
remote viewing projects
don&#39;t actually
utilize
the development of consciousness as the
main paradigm they&#39;re actually
doing
techniques that trick the monkey mind
so that people can remote view
what&#39;s the difference it&#39;s huge because
i remember the head of army intelligence
telling me about taking a bunch of his
guys through
um
the monroe institute who were young uh
army intelligence fellows
and they didn&#39;t have any real
understanding
of trans-dimensional physics
consciousness
non-locality and they were just put
through the course
and they actually were very good got
very good at the remote viewing of a
target in the soviet union or whatever
it was
however so many of them ended up having
mental breakdowns committing suicide
becoming alcoholics etc because
this this city this ability was
unleashed
in a kind of a brutal way to get a test
done
without the concomitant
or contemporaneous
development of consciousness and wisdom
and understanding so it just basically
blew their minds
does this make sense
david morehouse when i was with him
years before he had his book come out he
was one of the really adept remote
viewers
that the military had he said every
single one of us
ended up becoming alcoholics
mental breakdowns institutionalized
divorce suicide because the approach
they were taking
was one that didn&#39;t allow for this
holistic development of higher
consciousness
that then spontaneously leads to the
unfolding of the cities
so
this is why you don&#39;t want to just force
there are things i could do to teach
people
that would just boom get them there but
if they haven&#39;t developed this higher
consciousness ability two things happen
one it becomes an asymmetric development
of their internal
environment
very important to realize this
and that causes perturbations in their
stability and they got unstable
the other thing that happens is that
without the development of higher
consciousness
there is a tendency to use this ability
for selfish or harmful reasons
and in an enlightened state
because you enter into this
deep understanding of consciousness you
don&#39;t want to
harm someone else because you know
you&#39;re actually harming yourself
because you are all beings
this is the heart of compassion that the
buddha speaks about
does this make sense so that means that
you&#39;re not going to have this proclivity
to to learn an ability and then apply it
to
do a psychic assassination or something
like this or the project amethyst at the
national security agency where they
train people to use consciousness and
other technologies to kill people in
their sleep you know about project
amethyst
oh well i just spilled the beans on a
big one but so that kind of thing
and
i knew a man who was in the project
oh boy
really interesting
a magnetic magnetic field meter
well that is what i said i mean it was a
project where they had people who
utilized both
technologies that were trans-dimensional
and conscious interface with
innate abilities to
do selective assassinations
and that those systems have been
available for a very long time
so everything i look at this as the
field of consciousness
and you can use it for good
or you can
take your ego
or other people and try to do something
that is forced and damaging
and so the path of safety
not only is it more effective in a
faster way of doing it but a way of
doing this safely
is to develop
higher states of consciousness and
enlightenment so that these cities
evolve spontaneously
and are used only for the good
a lot of people are shocked that i think
it was 1993 or four a man who invented
an electronic system that was a tac
yesterday i&#39;ve been talking about cat
consciousness assisted technologies
where the consciousness assists the
technology in doing something
like these random number generators but
there are also technologies
that actually you can hook yourself up
to
that assist the consciousness in
attaining remote viewing and non-locat
locality and applications
uh
and those are
of course
interstellar civilizations have both
this man who was i guess in his mid 80s
when i met him
in the 90s
who since passed away
had developed such a system
around 1956
where you could hook yourself up to this
electronic system
and anyone doesn&#39;t matter how
enlightened enlightened they were would
get into a state of consciousness where
they could remote view accurately
anywhere
and he offered it to me
for the c-seti teams i said no thank you
because if the people develop have that
ability but they haven&#39;t developed
a non-violent consciousness
enlightenment
and aren&#39;t doing this for the purpose of
universal peace
it would be
very dangerous
moreover almost certainly i would have
been killed at that time to take
possession of such a technology so i
said that&#39;s all right thank you very
much for the offer
and i asked him i said well what
happened to he says well i developed it
because i think this would thought this
would be something great for the public
and would demonstrate the true nature of
consciousness and reality this is in the
50s
if adam curry is listening this would be
great for him to hear this and and dr
john at princeton
so about i was about one year old when
this was out
and
a toddler
so
but he said what happened is that a
corporation that was a front company for
the cia
bought it out
and it was basically you sell it to us
or we&#39;re going to take it anyway and
you&#39;re dead
so this has happened for many many many
decades
and
the the safer approach
is this
very ancient and innate ability
to connect to the quiet mind
and develop
this so that your entire internal
spiritual
reality
is enlightened
and from there
you develop
the cities
consciousness
assisted technologies
remote viewing
bilocation
interstellar contact all that&#39;s
emanating from a paradigm that is
innately from this enlightened field
where then
it&#39;s very hard not that it can&#39;t happen
but it&#39;s less likely for the ego to spin
sideways out of control and use it in
harmful ways
so that&#39;s why i teach it this way
does this make sense to folks you know
i dropped these little vignettes just to
give you illustrations of
the risks of doing things unwisely
not everything that can be done should
be done
and there are wise ways to do
do things and there are unwise ways
there are life-supporting ways in ways
that are incredibly dangerous
and this is gets to the question that of
how are we going to go forward as a
civilization
that with this kind of knowledge both
technological and in consciousness
we need to have the wise elders
so instead of a bunch of
misanthropic sociopaths
running these covert programs
and dealing with the e.t presence we
need the dalai lama and paul hellyer and
you guys and some other you know we need
to have the best of humanity not the
worst
and
yeah
and i think you know those of you in the
room are really represent the best of
humanity
and those listening
and the average person on earth are
basically very very good people
um living in the middle east i i came to
realize that it takes very few fanatics
to ruin
it for everyone
and people who live in latin america
mostly wonderful people it takes a very
small percentage of people who are
psychopathic drug lord gangs to ruin it
for guatemala and honduras and mexico so
it really takes a very small percentage
of the population but that only happens
when we give up our power and people are
intimidated
and
shirk off the responsibility
so this gets into this whole question of
how did we get here
and i think this this is where you get
into the idea of uh spiritual courage
and
if i were to name one thing that has
resulted in the world being in its
 state
where we&#39;ve lost 100 years of conscious
and technological evolution
it isn&#39;t because of some boogie man in
cabal you want to hate
it&#39;s because the average person has
given up the responsibility
to do the right thing over and over and
over again and i have witnessed this so
rather than blaming someone else look in
the mirror and say what can i do
and do it with courage
that&#39;s why i left medicine
to do this
because i realized
after many meetings with people like the
cia director and the senior officials
and senate intelligence committee
members and doing briefings for
presidents those folks weren&#39;t going to
do it
they didn&#39;t have the courage to do it
so having the knowledge isn&#39;t enough
having the information isn&#39;t enough
having power isn&#39;t enough having money
isn&#39;t enough you also have to have the
courage to do it
and again getting back to what i was
sharing last night a little of this this
state of consciousness that&#39;s the dawn
of the what&#39;s called the shambhala
warrior
and not warrior in the sense of violence
but true inner
courage that comes from spirit and heart
where you&#39;re not intimidated and you do
the right thing no matter what
we need more people to do that and
there&#39;s it&#39;s become a very sadly rare
commodity on earth to find people who
will do who live their life that way and
walk that talk
and and really that&#39;s what we need
and we need a lot of them not not me by
myself or you we need millions of people
who get this and just simply are not
going to be intimidated uh anymore and
will stand up to the bullies and the
thugs
so you know sort of like getting back to
the i call the you know the the these
gangs
but you have the gang banksters
all right in the financial system and
they&#39;re puppets in the military and
intelligence services
um so but it&#39;s a relatively small number
of very powerful
sociopathic people
and we don&#39;t have to give up our future
to that
but we will unless we come together in a
united and clear way to make a change
happen
and as the chinese saying goes unless we
change directions we&#39;re likely to end up
where we&#39;re going
i love that because it&#39;s so it it&#39;s
obviously true but no one thinks about
where the hell are we going
so we have to think about this and where
we are headed
is uh not in a good direction
but we can change that direction
through mass field consciousness and
mass action
doing this all together which is another
reason why all these technologies and
sciences have to be brought forward with
the whole
world watching
you know if you had a 100 million dollar
venture capital fund you better spend 40
million dollars of it on pr and
advertising like you would for a movie
so and the other 60 goes into the
technology development and you&#39;d have it
because you need to have stakeholders
who aren&#39;t just money people but are the
men and women of earth
who because if those folks are on your
side
these these other interests can&#39;t do
anything about it
and the more you give into the impulse
of fear
and do things secretively like when
people come up to me and whisper
i said
forget about that shout it from the
rooftops
because doing things in that furtive
secretive way you&#39;re playing on you&#39;re
on their dance floor
remember they own the night we own the
light disclosure out boom
it doesn&#39;t mean i don&#39;t keep confidences
when asked to i do
but i&#39;m talking about what we have to do
as a culture
is to reverse that dynamic
of secrecy into openness
and on technologies that deal with
consciousness even more so
but there has to be people who can
people need to speak to this in a wise
way
so that it&#39;s understood that
like all tools
you know you can have a knife and you
can cut your
uh you can cut your steak with it or you
can slit someone&#39;s
throat with it the knife doesn&#39;t care
it&#39;s the consciousness that
wields it
and so those we have to understand
there&#39;s a responsibility
to wielding this kind of
information knowledge power whether it
be in consciousness or energy generation
or
electromagnetographics anti-grav
now just so to be record clear we are
not interested in pursuing the z plane
right now the vertical plane things that
fly because those are obviously quickly
weaponizable there&#39;s a
a delivery system for a missile and the
world isn&#39;t at the point where that can
should happen
we&#39;re wanting to bring out
the knowledge of the sciences of
consciousness for positive mass
conscious change
as well as
the sciences of zero point energy
generation that run your house and car
things that fly that&#39;s phase two
that&#39;s later i always tell people who
don&#39;t bite off more than you can chew
or as the people on wall street say hogs
get slaughtered
so you know we don&#39;t want we need our
whole civilization is really on its back
so we want to
walk before we levitate let&#39;s take this
one step so that we want to get up and
moving and get to a
a level one or two
civilization
first
where did that come from
somebody&#39;s phone
strange
okay
oh okay
interesting so that&#39;s that&#39;s uh
sort of the paradigm you know which i
could teach you this technique to to
realize that the consciousness
techniques
and the technologies all need to have
the same impulse of doing
uh being in the good and doing for
others and being at service for
and not something that should be
centered around
self-aggrandizement
or selfish purposes
and
it isn&#39;t that you can&#39;t do that army
intelligence folks certainly did it
the intelligence cia folks certainly
have done it
but just because it can be done doesn&#39;t
mean it should
be done or that it&#39;s helpful in the long
run it&#39;s actually very counterproductive
in the long run and actually this is
what this general was telling me it was
actually an incredibly counterproductive
effort
and ingo swann said the same thing
and that&#39;s why i try to uh to the extent
i can share a paradigm of consciousness
and consciousness technologies and
techniques within a paradigm of
universal peace and something that moves
society forward
and that&#39;s how i would ask that all of
you continue to utilize this
so are you ready to do a little
meditation and uh
yeah
and then we&#39;ll do
so i&#39;m gonna
see if i can do this is when i scream
nurse help me
oh
well there are 300 technicians here and
no help
okay
are you all right
no
you
you don&#39;t ask a doctor to do something
mechanical like that
a chest tube no problem this
forget about it
is that good you hear me oh wonderful
okay
so
we might want to dim
you know this is lit up like a
crazy place
that&#39;s the
most sensitive level of the magnetic
field meter
doing this just as i started to say
we&#39;re going to ring the tibetan prayer
bowl go into meditation together and do
this remote viewing exercise
there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s moved over there
that&#39;s an electromagnetic device it&#39;s
very strange
we&#39;re going to get into some really cool
stuff tonight about all these
electronics
i&#39;m not doing this this is an
unscheduled bizarre thing
it&#39;s like r2d too chattering
and be quiet
yeah i know
but
it&#39;s because we&#39;re wired in
i&#39;m going to explain what just happened
tonight or later today on that
so let&#39;s sit quietly and close our eyes
i&#39;m going to ring the tibetan prayer
bowl
and this can be used just like a mantra
when i ring it you&#39;ll hear the ringing
tone
and the the correct way to use these is
to use them as a
met like you would listen to chanting or
a mantra
or music is to let your mind rest on it
however
with your eyes closed and have your mind
become centered on the tone
and then become aware of the mind
watching the tone and at the point that
the tone fades away at the end you are
left with just the contemplation
of the mind itself
um
uh
alright
as we sit here in silence
let us take some deep breaths
in with our nose
and out with our mouth
and as we breathe in with our nose
see our third eye
and our awareness expanding
and our body filled with light and
energy
and as we exhale
allow ourselves to release and let go
of all of our limitations and concerns
and all doubts
and all
that holds us back from the ocean of
consciousness
teeming within each of us
and with each inward breath
we draw in the prana
the chi the life force
that is conscious
and we are more awake
energized
and harmonious
and with each exhalation
we become more relaxed
and peaceful and calm
and our entire body
from their toes
all the way up to the top of our head
is at once
enlivened and relaxed
energized
but steady and calm
and now let us breathe normally
and gently watch the breath
and as we breathe in
and breathe out
we become aware
of the mind
watching the breath
and it is awareness of awareness
and all perceptions whether they be
sounds physical feelings
thoughts
the breath
we allow them to come and go
and feel the joy and the ease
of just being aware of the mind watching
the breath
perceiving
all things
and as we gently become more aware of
the mind
we behold it as a vast and infinite
field
of consciousness
and that each of us as individuals
are apertures openings
vessels
in which this indivisible field of
consciousness is present
in its totality and fullness
at all times
and that the nature of the consciousness
the mind
when we are deep and silent
and calm
is that it is unbounded
infinite
eternal
it transcends the boundaries of space
and time
and yet is present at every point in
space and time
in its fullness
just like a quantum hologram
and so now let us dive into this quiet
mind
settling into this vast ocean
and becoming deeper
and more quiet
and the breath becomes very faint
and as we go into the quietness of mind
we recede
from the turmoil of perceptions
and the perceptions of thought
self sound
all that we perceive
are like distant ripples and waves on
the ocean
of this infinite mind within us
and so each of us
as drops of individual creation
allow ourselves to merge into this one
mind
that is the true nature
of the self
and we go now
more deeply into silence
peace
and we feel the joy
and the serenity
of the place
that is the placeless
this eternal home
that resides within each and every thing
and every being
so let us sit in silent meditation for a
few moments
if you become distracted return to the
breathing technique
or you may use the mantra
and let us just meditate
and go into deeper appreciation
of the quiet mind
and know its true nature
is infinite
and unbounded
and omnipresent
now in this relaxed state
let us affirm to ourselves
with no doubt
that the nature of consciousness
is that is omnipresent
not
limited
just ourselves or this place
it is always
a field
of indivisible
pure consciousness
and very gently
let us bring into our awareness
the geography of north america
and very effortlessly
since the mind is omnipresent
and instantaneously we float over to the
east coast
and crossing the appalachian mountains
we come into the area
in virginia
near thomas jefferson&#39;s home
and the university of virginia
and we see the great rotunda
in the center of the campus
built by thomas jefferson
and the city of charlottesville
virginia
and then as we come
west
towards the blue ridge mountains into
the countryside
we see my home
and it sits on about 65 acres on a knoll
overlooking the blue ridge in shenandoah
and as we descend
from above
we see
the entry to the property
and we see the house
and we see
two dogs
that are outside
a female named rosie
and a male named chance
and without straining or guessing
remaining in this quiet state of mind
we take a tour of the property
and we float around the house from all
directions
the front entry
the back the sides
and we see these two dogs
and we see what they look like
their color their size
their personalities
and we do this
like a child
would approach any
joyful thing
something that is fun
and easy
and if we find at any moment we are
straining or guessing
we just go back to the contemplation
of the mind
the breathing
the mantra
and become centered and calm
and then we return back
to the farm
to see the house
and the dogs
and so each time we find ourselves
intellectualizing or guessing
we stop the process
and return to centering into the vast
silent ocean of awareness
and allow the image
of these dogs to pop into our minds
and what the property and the structures
look like
and it unfolds effortlessly
as if the mind is an infinite screen
and anything you wish to perceive within
it
can be
played
or emerge onto the screen
and so i will be silent
and we will continue to
remote view the property and the dogs
and practice this technique
of meditation
going deep and silent within
and then gently intending to know
or see or feel
the two dogs and the property
without straining or guessing
now
as we begin to return to this room
we send a light of
guidance and protection
to that property
and
say goodbye for now
and we return here very gently
we become aware
again of this space
here in
desert hot springs
and then when you&#39;re ready
you may slowly open your eyes
and as you open your eyes affirm
being mindful
that the nature of the consciousness
within you
is always
omnipresent
non-local
not limited by space and time
and so even as i begin to share
what the property
and the dogs look like
you can continue to remote view
the property and the dogs with your eyes
open
because your mind is channel one and
your eyes and all other senses are
secondary
primacy is with consciousness
