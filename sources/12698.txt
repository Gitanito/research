On a very cold night in Canada, in November 1974, I was involved in a very severe high-speed head-on collision accident, whereby I was thrown one hundred fifty feet from my car. I traveled at mid-air seventy-five to one hundred miles per hour, which ended with my head hitting the hard ground. When I literally came back to life, after I was officially medically declared as brain dead. I remember at first not knowing where I was, who I was, or why I was even in hospital. The whole left side of my body was paralyzed. Later I was told that I had officially been brain dead for six days. After I remembered my name, I started to pray, to ask for help, in reference to why the whole left side of my physical body was paralyzed. I requested healing from God. After an excruciatingly slow, yet miraculous recovery process of about one week, I was finally able to walk. I continued to have disbelief, about what I was continually told by parents, relatives, doctors and friends, about why I ended up in hospital to start with. I could not even spell my own name yet. 

I continued to be in an overwhelming shock-like state of disbelief, and felt none that had happened was real. Or surely must have been a dream. Despite many telling me what had actually happened, I felt strongly that my car was in the hospital parking lot, when in actuality, it had been totaled. I was sitting in a junk yard. I ended up leaving the hospital in my confusion and disbelief, and even got into another car, believing this car was mine. I started it with the keys that had been left in it. I drove this car back to where I had lived, sixty miles away and then back to the hospital as well. How I survived this whole ordeal was nothing short of miraculous. At the time I was driving this car, I was only capable of double-vision, and was driving on a snowy, slippery, slick highways. So many weeks later, I was released from hospital, and ended up staying with relatives. Five years later, in 1979, I had moved to Florida, and was hired as a medical hemodialysis technician, working in Intensive Care. I had also met and married my wife.

Twenty years later, in 1994, I finally remembered, where my spirit (soul), went during the six days when I was temporarily brain dead, on full life support. This story is not to be confused with a near death experience or out of body experience, since my death was very real, although temporary. You see, the terminology, ‘brain dead coma’, is really a contradiction in terms. The definition of any ‘coma’ is solely unconsciousness, not indicative of death. The definition of ‘brain dead’ or ‘brain death’ is permanent cessation of the function of the brain stem, which controls the vital functions of breathing and heart beating. Even The Gospel according to John, Chapter 11, verses 38-44, refers to Lazarus' dead body as having a decaying-like odor, after four days of being dead. This is indicative of a very real, however, temporary, death. John 11: 38-44: ‘…Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, ‘Lord already there is a stench, because he has been dead four days... the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped up in a cloth…’

Anyway, going back to when I finally remembered where my spirit was. I remember my spirit seeing the most overwhelming and wondrous light. While I was being drawn towards this light, this light became larger. Then I found myself in a lit tunnel of tremendous bright light, and other spirits moving past me. I stood still. Midway between the entrance and exit of this tunnel, I actually reviewed my whole life and existence. I contemplated whether I would want to go back to my life on Earth. It was then that I received an incredible amount of knowledge of a great many matters. Knowledge concerning life, death, and the after-life. I can no longer remember what was shared. God told me that I was not going to be allowed to retain this incredible amount of knowledge after I would be sent back into my physical body. God told me also that I would not return for a very long time. I remember being in the tunnel, with the ever so wondrous bright light, as well as any conversations with God. When I did remember this, so that I to this day might remember, I wrote it all down. 

I also recall how it was emphasized by God. I was told how hard it would be, to once again live out my life in my physical body. Even so, I promised God I would tell as many people as I could about this temporary death experience. I believe it seemed like it was my decision, which God allowed me to have, to return to my physical body. However, at the same time, I somehow already knew that I would be returning. This was before I was even made aware that God was allowing me to make this most crucial, significant decision. While God was talking to me, I heard Him address me, by my middle name, ‘John.’ Only God could know that ‘John’ is what I would have preferred to have been called by my parents. While I was still in the brightly lit tunnel, I possessed the knowledge that if one (a spirit), were to have exited this tunnel, there would then be no chance of ever being able to return to one's former physical life on Earth.

Since remembering, my wife and I strongly feel that we have been led by solely God to believe, that it in any matter of our earthly lives it is always Gods decision ultimately. We have read (from Dr. Ken Vincent's near death experience research and Universal Salvation), that are seventy seven verses to support the Doctrine of Predestination, from the New Testament. (Hastings, Grant, and Rowley 1953). Our favorite Bible verse to support the Doctrine of Predestination is in Psalm 139 verse 5: ‘You hem me in from behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.’ Jesus himself backs up the Doctrine of Predestination, in John 5:19, as well as John Chapter 6:44 and 6:65.

I’ve had three miracles since 1982, as if being back here after 1974 is not one in and of itself.  These miracles are clearly not possible to us. Here below are two that happened on the same day: 

While driving my new motorcycle on the autobahn in Austria I over revved the engine, and then the engine stopped, dead locking up the rear wheel. I came to a screeching stop. There was smoke coming from the motor, and when I tried to kick start the engine it was jammed. I was scared to death. There were no off ramps for forty miles and cars/trucks were passing me at one hundred thirty to one hundred eighty miles per hour. I prayed and less than ten seconds later, I tried to start the bike. After the first kick, it started and ran like it did when I first bought it. On the same day, on the way back, and on the same autobahn, exactly across from the other side of the road wear the engine failed, I completely ran out of gas. I did have a half tank when I started out. I’d had already used the reserve tank of gas. I looked in the tank to see it dry put the gas cap back on. I prayed, and again in less than ten seconds, I checked the gas tank and seen it was filled to the same amount that I had put in that morning. All of the above is very true!

God bless!

Rick
