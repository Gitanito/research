  		              		Experience Description   

    My father and I were  in his room when I went into the bathroom. My blood sugar began to drop. I experienced a heavy dizziness.

 I was moving at full velocity, like free falling into an endlessly spiraling tunnel. In that fall, all my life's memories began to appear in photos.  I saw them one after the other and appearing from the left to right. The photos came along with a very strong 'blowing' sound every time it passed me. Later I exited the tunnel and was lying on the bathroom floor beside my father.  He told me that I had fainted.   
  
  One year later, I fainted again.  During that time, I experienced something that made me feel as if I were in another dimension.  

  I fainted at a bar although I hadn't drank more than one beer. I was talking with a friend. All of a sudden, everything began to get dark and I told my friend I was about to faint. Then, I began to walk in a city of darkness that was illuminated by weak lights. I floated inside a sphere that was full of rays of energy.  There were people who passed by around me.  they had shadows covering their faces.  It seemed that they could not see me.
