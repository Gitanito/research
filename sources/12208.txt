  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 6 weeks pregnant and went to the Clinic for an abortion. The doctor gave me an overdose of lidocaine to the womb and I passed out immediately. I awoke to a panicking nurse standing above me with paddles and in a panic. What happened to me during that time  forever changed me. 
  
  I was taken to a  beautiful meadow with yellow flowers everywhere. I’m not sure what kind of flowers they were. For a while, I was just ‘walking’ around in this meadow taking in all of the feelings. I say 'walking' because I didn’t really have a body. I was just sort of floating around.
  
  I remember feeling the best I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I know that I will never feel as good as I felt on that day and that place. For the first time ever, I felt whole,  complete and like I belonged. It’s so overwhelming and  hard to describe how great I felt. I remember thinking ‘Am I dead?'
  
  After awhile, I noticed to my left a line of evergreen trees. I knew not to go to the trees because once I passed, I would be in another realm.  I wasn’t ready for that yet.
  
  Then I was in complete awe and happiness because I saw my deceased Grandmother above the trees. I was in shock because she looked the same age as when she died. She never said anything, but we were happy to reunite. She had a glow and I could only see her from her shoulders to her head. I remember thinking, 'Thank God, she is o.k.!  I’m in Heaven and  must tell my family.' 

  Then Jesus appeared beside Grandma. Nothing was said or implied, but He began to fade and change. The next thing I knew,  was  that the nurse standing over me replaced Jesus.   I realized that I was back.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I had no sense of time whatsoever. It could’ve been seconds or days and I wouldn’t have known the difference.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Everything was bright and glowing.

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It was like Earth in that it was a meadow with trees, but also it was not like earth. No place on Earth can do justice to the beauty of this place I saw. It was like viewing the TV in 4K before 4K was invented.

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   Non-practicing  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I’m more spiritual.  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated   Spiritual  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was a non-practicing Catholic and  was  skeptical about the afterlife.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I definitely believed in an afterlife after my experience. A few years later I saw a special on Dateline that said NDEs were a result of electrical impulses in the brain, so the program  made me doubt again.  
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I saw my deceased Grandmother and Jesus.

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   I saw my Grandmother and I was so excited to see her because I knew then that she was in Heaven and everything was going to be ok.   I also saw Jesus but so briefly and He started to fade.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I saw Jesus. He had the long hair just like depicted here on Earth.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I felt special and privileged that I was the one chosen to see Grandma.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife probably exists     Yes     Seeing Grandma and Jesus was proof that there is more after death.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The emotional feelings are nothing I’ve experienced. They were same as here but much, much more intense.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I was a drug addict/alcoholic at the time, so life in general was very fuzzy and out of focus. But I sure do remember everything about that day at the Clinic.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     When my Grandfather died last week, I asked for a specific sign from him to tell me he’s ok . I almost fainted when I got what I asked for!  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Seeing Grandma brought great comfort.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    About 4 years. They looked at me funny.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was so vivid and spectacular, it had to be real.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I still feel it was real, how else can I explain it? Nothing like it has or will happen to me like that again.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Best moment of my life.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Doesn’t work well on phone.
