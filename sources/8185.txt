I closed my eyes and suddenly I saw this intense light that was everywhere. The next moment I was in a place and it was kinda fuzzy and in the background I could see light again. I also saw a figure who was standing in the light and reaching his/her had to me. I tried to walk towards him/her, but I couldn't because there were an invisible wall between us. And when I tried to walk through it I couldn't because it hindered me. Then I saw the exact same light as at the beginning of the experience. The kind of light which filled everything. And I opened my eyes.
