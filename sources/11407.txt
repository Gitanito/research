While I was rushed to surgery, I was telling the doctor about things that were going to happen next and they did happen. After the surgery, my doctor explained that I had reached the stage of heightened awareness and so was being able to tell what was going to happen next. At one point during the surgery, I remember having no air inside me. I believe that was the time when my lungs had collapsed (as told by the doctor later). They had lost me for about eleven seconds. 

At this time, I remember very clearly, what I felt was something like someone wanting to place some blocks on me - like a jigsaw puzzle - but they didn't know where to fix it. I knew and wanted to let them know. I was screaming to tell but they could not hear me. I lifted my arm but suddenly realized my arm was in two places on the operation table and trying to reach the doctor. At that point, I gave up but strangely, I was not at all sad. I accepted it almost, lay back feeling satisfied with a feeling of a lot of peace and calm around me. I felt happy that the doctors had failed to fit the puzzle piece. Then suddenly I felt a gush of cold air filling my body which may have been the ventilator starting. I woke up the next day.
