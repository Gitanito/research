    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Psychic Studies.
 A Monthly Publication Devoted to Spiritual Science--Spiritual Phenomena.
 Know Thyself
 1889--1890  Monthly
 San Francisco, CA.  Editor: Albert Morton, editor and publisher.  Succeeded by: Psychic Studies, Cincinnati, OH

 1/1, June 1889-1/12, May 1890.  $1.00 a year, 32 pp.  Morton was a very early spiritualist and his transformations mirror those of spiritualism itself.  This journal was an interim project apparently devoted to Morton's recollections of the mediums he had encountered, including Susan Grimshaw of Milwaukee in the early 1860s, the Davenport Brothers and William Fay, Helen L. Palmer (Wiltse), Charles H. Foster, Henry Slade (with whom he lived for a time), W.H. Mumler, Henry B. Allen ("The Allen Boy"), and others.  The journal reflected the broader interests of spiritualism (and Morton) at the time in articles like "Pre-Natal Conditions and Heredity," "Magnetic, Mental, and Spiritual Healing," "The Power and Proper Exercise of Will," and "Conservation of Health and Life Forces."  Morton presciently predicted the future in opining that "Southern California presents the most favorable conditions for the development of mediumistic powers, and . . .  it may yet become the Mecca of Spiritualists."  The journal also featured prominent advertisements for the Summerland Colony, for which Morton was an agent, and for his wife, who was a "Spirit Medium for Diagnosis of Disease; Psychometric and Prophetic Readings."  The journal ceased in May 1890 but was revived in June 1895 under the auspices of Light of Truth in Cincinnati, still with Morton listed as editor.  The restored journal was published bi-monthly with 132 pp. for $1.25 a year, and reprinted material that had appeared in the earlier journal.  On Morton, see the note under Summerland.  NSAC Lily Dale has 1/12, May 1890 only (the last issue of the original journal).       Issues:Psychic Studies V1 N12 May 1890 Psychic Studies (Light of Truth Series) V1 N2 May 1895      </p>
