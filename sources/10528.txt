  		              		Experience Description   

  I died when I was little, but can't accurately remember how old I was.  I might have been 8 or 9 years old. I do remember that I was in grade 2.
  
  It was an accident.  My brother and sister put a pillow over my face and smothered me.  They didn't see it as bad. At the time,  they were trying to stop me from winning a game.
  
  I remember clearly and I felt in such peace.  I was suspended on the ceiling,  which seemed higher than the actual ceiling.  I watched them below and realised that I better go back because they might get in trouble if I didn't do so.  I did wonder if I should stay, but decided to go back.
  
  I sat up and told them what happened.  They never believed me and nor does anyone I tell to this day.

  Since that day a lot of strange things happened.

  I am at peace with  all the horrific things that have happened to me since this experience.  I have this strange understanding that it's all for me to grow as a spirit, to learn what I can, and teach others in a non-direct way. For example, I feel I need to guide and teach people about good because when they come back and they've been evil,  a long and scary life awaits until they learn how to be spiritual.  
  
  I am now 52 and although I still struggle emotionally and spiritually, I am consciously aware that I have purpose.  I know there are spirits around us.  I know about making a white bright light protection bubble around myself and those I love.
  
  I didn't go to 'another place' when I died. But I know I was dead and I knew of the other place,  the real place.  I chose to come back by myself.  Although nobody can confirm that I died, I know I did.

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I'm often in communication with my spirit self and I'm always aware that those who have passed may be nearby, whether they know me or not.  Also I am often aware that I have timely help from spiritual realms  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   I believe in the Source  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I knew about religions etc. but was not even surprised that I was aware there is actually no real religion.  There is the source who is part of us, there is love and that is all you need.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Despite being abused, being bullied, being poor and struggling, I believed and still believe I am not fully alone and I am protected and loved

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     There is a 'Source' and it exists aside and among us, with us.  The source can be reached through discussion in your mind or verbally or just through emotions  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I knew I had to go back and chose to go back.  I know I need to learn everything I can and share what I learn.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I had to go through experiences (unknown at the time) to find something I need.  I cannot say what it is or if I have found it or what it is  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     We live forever.  Our spirit/soul/essence lives on forever as we gain experiences that feed our spirit/soul/essence.  Time isnt really there and we are all special and amazing and learning always.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     We are all here temporary and if we don't get what we need spiritually, we will be back in one form or another

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     Many hardships which resulted in me being confused but confident, caring, compassionate, wanting to help, believing people are more wonderful and special than they know.  I have recently become vegan and I believe it's the right thing.  We should not harm.  We should love  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I remained loving throughout all abuses.  I realize nothing lasts forever and people don't mean to be jerks.  
  
After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Not anyone believed me and people still have problems believing me today.  I was made fun of  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Like it just happened  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I'm extremely perceptive and sometimes even prophetic  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I wasnt aware of any body parts.  I was a thought, or idea or spirit  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Not a single person took me seriously and I've been made fun of  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I knew it was real and tried to tell my family but everyone made fun of me and said I was lying  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It was as real as me filling in this form  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No thank you  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Simplify your questions.  Don't use red and green - it is distracting.  Keep your explanations short, I skipped over the long ones.  Other than that, its fine.  Again, good to tell someone
