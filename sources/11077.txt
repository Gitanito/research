  		              		Experience Description   

    I was on my way home from work. It had been raining and I didn't know it had rained before I left for home. I hydroplaned around a curve going 50 mph. My car  took a small flight,  went two-feet into the ground, flipped 3 times. By the third flip, I  was ejected out of my vehicle and through the windshield. I thought it was a dream, until I was told that I was fully conscious the whole time. 

  Before I woke up, I was in a pure black room that had invisible walls that revealed stars. The room was cold and dark, but  it felt so nice. I felt a presence behind me. I felt the presence was too comforting,  as if something was wrong. I was in my childhood body.  But, I was pure white. The crease of ceilings connecting to the walls and the floor were like a shiny, overlapping, silver string . Due to the presence of the figure, I wanted to leave. So,  I immediately got up and ran to the wall. It revealed a door to be opened. There was a bright light shining through the door. 

  As soon as I went through the door,  I 'woke up' in the ambulance covered in blood. When I found out the true details of my accident, I was fully conscious and talking to the first responders. But I had no memory of that.  I just remembered that dream. The first responders I had met after my accident, all said they were sure I would have died from how bad the crash was,   how much blood was all over the vehicle and myself, and with how bad my injuries were. But I only had a small brain bleed, a neck fracture in my C2 vertebrae, and five gashes on my body. I left the hospital in 3 days and was  fully walking.

Did the questions asked and information that you provided accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?         Uncertain     I want to know why I have an hour unaccounted for, why such little injuries caused it even without surgery, why I can't remember things, and why the presence couldn't face me
