  		              		Experience Description   

  I started to feel very cold, as if I were having fever chills.  It was -30 C outside. I was in my car with the heat  running at full power. But, I was still ice cold, like a corpse. And then, I  separated from myself. I was standing next to the car. I watched  how my boyfriend was worried, so I laid down on the seat next to him.  

  I was quickly pulled upward. I didn't get a chance to look around, but I knew a bright,  warm light was carrying me. After getting up, I walked in a foggy place where there were people that I had never seen before.  I didn't know where to go. Suddenly,  through the fog, my relatives began to appear. I was walking with them and  talking to my mother. I felt like I had been there a long time, almost all day.  My mother told me what would happen to me in the future. She then told me that it was not my time to be there, and that I had to go back.  I badly didn't want to go back because I wanted to stay there with them. They had their own world there. It was light, airy, weightless, and without evil or pain. My relatives started to walk away from me and disappear into the fog and mist. After that, it became dark. The darkness was pulling me down, more and more.  It was difficult and unpleasant, like I was being born all over again.  I returned to my body.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw myself from the side and didn’t feel anything that I had been feeling while conscious. Here   there was a lightness, but I didn't understand what was happening.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it 
    
    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   Life here is completely different from there. It's like everything there is better.

    Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast    

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning    

    Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My vision became better. I saw things that I could not see in my everyday life, with completely different colors and contrast.    

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      At the beginning it was muffled like wWhen I was being lifted.  But the higher and higher I went, the more distinct my vision became.    

    Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out    

    Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes         

    Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them

    What emotions did you feel during the experience?         At first, there was a feeling of not understanding and of being lost. Then, after entering the other dimension, there was a feeling of bliss and peace. I t was warm and bright, both inside and outside of me. 

    Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness    

    Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy    

    Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world    

    Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others         

    Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     I saw how I had lived and how I was living. When I saw how I was living, I understood that I was not living correctly.    

    Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future.     My mother told me about what awaited me in the future; about my children, career, and life in general.    

    Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.      

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     It's like I can see through people and I can read minds.

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real         

    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No       

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         If it would not jeopardize my life, I would like to go through this again in order to see the relatives I no longer have in life.    

    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No
