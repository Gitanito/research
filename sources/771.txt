T. Ephemerides Explained, which is
the firſt thing that the young Artiſt muſt *
be acquainted with after he hath lear-->
nedtheCharadiers of the Signs, Planetſ, .
and Aſpecif.
N Ephemerides ſignifies a Day-Book, and
A in this Science it is to be underſtood on
ly for the Accidents of the Stars, as their Mo
tions, Stations, Latitudes, Aſpećts, Eclip
ſes, &c. and therefore to all theſe Purpoſes,
the Hebrew word is more Significant than ei
ther Engliſh, Latine, orGreek ; as ºnloºr,
Almanah, derived from the Radical word
Tijo,i.e. numeravit vel diſtribuit; but by the
Greeks it is called 'Eºſiuseus, from "Huáez,
dies, and ’Eri, in or ad; and by the Latines
Diarium, a Day-Book: and thus much for its
Definition. - -
In every Ephemiris there go two Pages to a
Month, as you may ſee in our Example; the
left hand Page always ſhews the Motion of the
ſeven Planets and the Dragon's-Head, and is
uſually divided into tenColumns ; the firſt of
which, is always the day of the Month ; the
ſecond, the place of theSun, ſhewing what de
gree he poſſeſſeth of that Sign in the top of
the Column, which is here G) × ; that is, in
Piſces; The next is the Moon, ſhewing what
degree ſhe poſſeſſethin theSign, either againſt
the day, or next above it, which againſt the
14th day, is Sagittary : The fourth Column
ſhews the Moon's Latitude 5 thatis, according
as ſhe approacheth or declines the Dragon's-
Head or Tail; S. fignifying Northward, D.
deſcending,
* -
|
º:#:
-
- deſcending, M.South, and A. aſcending: The
… fifth Column ſhews the Motion ofthe Dragon's-
Head , which is generally Retrograde ; the
* other Columns are underſtood after the ſame
*
manner, only where you find S. it ſignifies
Stationary, if D. Dire&, but if R. Retro
grade; The Sun and Moon are never ſo, the
Head of the Column ſhews the Sign, and the
D. M. under it, the Degree and Minute that
each Planet is in at Noon every day; and un
der theſe ſix Planets is their Latitudes to the
firſt, the eleventh, and the twenty firſt daysof
every Month.– -
The right hand Page,hath alſoten Columns,
which are all eaſily underſtood by this one
Example, in the firſt Column I find the four
teenth day, and againſt that, in the fourth,
fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh Columns, I alſo find
ºf 20 under the Charaćter of the G), án &
II under h, a A 20 under 3: , a >k 16
under 3 , which ſignifies that the Moon
comes to a Sextile of the Sun 20 hours
P. M. or afternoon, toan Oppoſition of Sa
turn, at II hours P. M. and ſo of the reſt in
theſe ſix ſmall Columns; over which, where
you find Qc, it ſignifies Occidental, but Or.
Oriental; in the tenth and laſt Column againſt
the 14th day, I find k, 3%, Q 13 p. that is,
a Sextile of fupiter and the Sun 13 hours P. M.
and where you find & Elong Max & G), that
is Penus in her greateſt Elongation from the
Sun the D Apogeon, is when ſhe is in the
Remoteſt part of her Epicycle, and fartheſt
from the Earth; the D Perigeum, is when ſhe
is neareſt the Earth.

Thirty equal parts, called Degrees; and each

Ofthe Terms of Art uſed both by the
Ancient and Modern Aſtrologers.
A*.tatton,is when two Planetsapproach

and this may be three ſeveral ways : Firſt,
when both Planets are direét, for Example, Yº
in 11 deg. of Y, and 3 in 9 degrees of Y,
both of them dire& ; here 3 applies to a
Conjunction of Nº. - -
* The ſecond is when two Stars are Retro
grade, and apply to each other by a Retro
grade motion; thus, it in 9 degrees of Y,
Retrograde, and 3 in 11 degreesof the ſame
Sign Retrograde alſo, here 3 applies to the
body of it by Retrograde motion.
Thirdly, when one Planet is Retrograde in
more degrees of a Sign, and another direét in
fewer; as ſuppoſe 3 in 12 degrees of Y. Re
trograde, and 2 in 10 degrees of Y, here 3
applies to ? and º. applies to 3, and this
kind of application is of great force and effi
cacy in all manner of Aſtrological Reſolutions;
but this muſt be remembred alſo, that a Supe
rior Planet cannotapply to an Inferior one un
leſs hebe Retrograde. . - - -
separatton---is when two Planets have
been in Conjunétion or Aſpe&t, and are going
from it, as T. in 6degrees of Y and 6 in 7
degrees; here 3 ſeparates himſelf- font.:
(20)
but yet he is not quite ſeparated from him,
till they are diſtant from each other 8 degrees
20 minutes, which is the moiety of both their
Orbs; what their Orbs and Aſpects are, ſhall
be ſhew’d in theChapter following.
39;obtbition,---is when two Planets are
applying to a Conjunétion or Aſpećt , and be
fore they can attain it, another Planet comes
to the Conjunétion or Aſpe't ofthe Planet ap
plied to, and ſo prohibits theformer ; as ſup
poſe h in 12 degrees of Y, \! in 19 degrees
applying to a Conjunčtion of h, and 3 in 8
degrees of the ſame Sign, here 3 by the
ſwiftneſs of his motion, comes firſt to a .
Conjunótion of h, and ſo hinders and prohi
bits the thing ſignified by M.. . . . . . . )

comes Retrograde, and is thenſaid to Refrain
his Aſpečt or Conjunětion, ash in 12 deg.Y.;
and 3; in 9 degrees of the ſame Sign, and be
fore his Conjunétion he becomes Retrograde 5.
and that is called Refranation, . . . "

more but this, the ſeparating of oneStar from
the Body or Aſpećt of another, and carrying
his Light and Nature to a third; as for Ex- \ .
ample, h in Io. degrees of Y, and Y, in 7.

The

The A Trine is when two Stars are diſtant
120 degrees, and is called by the Greeks Tef

The & Oppoſition is when Stars are diame

Theſe Aſpe&ts are dexter and finiſter, right

as you may ſee in the Table, Y is the Day
houſe of d", as D denotes ; and 8 is the
Night-houſe of2 as N ſhews you in the ſecond
Column, being direéted by the Title in the
head of each : So likewiſe the G) is exalted
in 19 deg of Y, and the D in 3 deg of ¥,
as the third Column informs you, ſo in the
fourth Column the G) governs the fiery Tri
plicity by day, and 3; by night ; ; go
#%,
verns the Earthy by day, and the
Night, as the two Letters D and N over
head ſignifie; but of governs the watry Tri
plicity both by day and night : alſo 3:

Q ſuffers detriment in Y, becauſe it is op
poſite to cº her houſe, and H hath his fall

Th: Table Explained.
This Table is only uſeful to the Phyſician
to know what Part of the Body is moſt affli
&ted, and where the Diſeaſe doth chiefly re
fide ; becauſe the Planetsſignifie various things
in various Houſes: to know this, Firſt find
your Significator by your Figure, and then
enter with your Planet in the head of the Ta
ble, and with the Sign in the left hand Co
lumn, and in the Angle of meeting you have
yeur deſire.
For Example.
Let fibe Significator, and he in SS, I enter
with h in thehead of the Table, and againſt .

The uſe of this Table is this, in the Co
lumn againſt Y, you find 8, 15, 30. and in
the next to it 9, 22. which tells you that the
firſt 8 deg. of Y are Maſculine,the 9th Femi
nine, from 9 to 15 Maſculine; from 15 to 22.
Femininefrom 22 to 30Maſculine; and thisis
very uſeful in matters of Theft, Conception,
and the like: So the8th deg.of Y is light,and
the 3d dark, the 24th void, the 6th pitted or
deep, the 19th a degree Increaſing Fortune 3
and ſo of the reſt.
This is uſeful in Theft, to diſcover the Sex
whether Male or Female, by obſerving , the
Poſition of the Lord of the Seventh, the 6
and the Significator of the Thief, and what:
degrees of the Signs they at the time of Inter
rogation are poſſeſs'd of, whether Maſculine:
or Feminine, and ſo Judg accordingly.
withtheſe things we alſo conſider in Judg
ment, Antiſcions andContra-antiſcions, which
are neceſſary to beknown in this Introdućtory
part, before I come to inlarge upon the De
ſcription of the Houſes of Heaven.
Theſe Antiſcions are Degrees in the Eclip
tick, beholding each other with equal diſtance
from the Tropicks, viz. GS and Wy; for ſo.
much as your Planet falls ſhort of this Tropick,
ſo much is the Antiſcion diſtant from it in .
Signs and Degrees; and theſe Antiſcions are
obſerved to fortunate any Planet that caſteth,
his benign Rays thereunto,
The Contra-Antiſcions are as much unfor--
tunate, and they are found always direétly op
poſite to the Antiſcions.

In this ſecond Table you muſt enter(for De
grees) the two firſt Columns, in one of which
you ſhall find the degree of your Planet, and
againſt that, the degreeof your Antiſcion.---

that the firſt and ſecond anſwer one to the

C H A P. VII.
Sheweth bow the Heavens are divided into
Twelve equal Party, called Houſer.
Efore you cometo ſet a Scheme or Figure
of Heaven, it will be convenient to let
you know what a Scheme is ; and therefore
be pleaſed to take notice, that a Figure or
Scheme is nothing elſe but a Delineation of
the Heavensin Plare, according to the diviſion
of the Sphear—Thus, -The Zodiack
is divided into 12 equal parts, called Houſes,
which Houſes the Signs of the Zodiack do al
ways poſſeſs, the principal Angles of theſe 12
are theAſcendant and Mid-heaven, with their
Oppoſites; theſe 12 Houſes are divided by the
Horizon into two Hemiſphears, the one su
prA terram, theother Infra terram ; that Hemi
hear above the Earth is divided by the Me
ridian into Oriental and Occidental, Eaſt and
Weſt: But of all parts of the Figure the Aſ.
cendant or firſt Houſe is moſt obſerved, being
eſteemed by the Learned in this Science, the
moſt Energical point in the whole Scheme,and
in Nativities it is the principal Significator of
Life; and to that end it is always direéted to.
its Promittors.
*** - Erom:
(39)
f
... From thisAſcendant they reckon the Houſes
forward, by which account, the 6th, 8th,
and 12th are accounted inimical or unfor.
tunate, as having no Aſpe&t to the Aſcendant:
they alſo reckon them backward, and ſo they
divide then into four quarters: The firſtquar.
ter or quadrant beginsattheCuſp of the Aſcen
dant, and terminates atthe Cuſp of thetenth,
containing the 12th, 11th,& 10th Houſes,and is
called the Oriental:Maſculine,Sanguine quarter,
and repreſents the Infant Age of Man.
The ſecond begins at the tenth Houſe, and
ends at theCuſp of the 7th Houſe, and con
tains the 9th, 8th, and 7th Houſes,and iscalled
the Meridian, Feminine Cholerick quarter,and
repreſents the youthful Age of Man.
The third quarter begins at the Cuſp of the
ſeventh Houſe, and ends at the Cuſp of the
fourth, and challengeth the 6th, 5th, and 4th
Houſes, and iscalled the Occidental, Maſculine,
Melancholy quarter; repreſenting Manhood
and well-grown years.
The fourth and laſt begins at the Cuſp of
the fourth, and ends at the Cuſp of the firſt
Houſe, containing the third, ſecond and firſt,
and is called the Northern, Feminine, Fleg
matick quarter, and repreſents Mans old Age.
Hence you may .. , that the firſt,
tenth, ſeventh, and fourth are called Angles;
the ſecond, fifth, eighth and cleventh, are
called Succedants; the third, ninth, ſixth,
and twelfth , are called Cadents; the Angles’
are the moſt Powerful ; the Succedants next
in Virtue and Power; but the Cadents the
weakeſt of them all. The better to be under

Of the Signification of the Twelve
Houſer.
He firſt Houſe containeth all that ſpace,
from the line where the figure of 1 #.
eth, to the line where the ſecond Houſe be
inneth (the laſt rule being remembred) and
lath ſignification of the life of Man', the
Stature, Complexion, and ſhape of the Que
rent or Native; it is called by the Greeks
'oejokorg-, and ſometimes'oeſ&y; becauſe
when the Sun or any other Star comes to that
point, they ariſe and become viſible in our
Horizon and Hemiſphear.
In Eclipſes and Mundane Revolutions it
ſignifies the common People in general, and
the ſtate of the whole Kingdom, and in a Na
tivity, if 3 behere it infillibly gives a wound
in the face; if b or Ry be here, they give al
ways ſome great deformity. In Horary Que
ſtions from this Houſe we give Judgment of
things belonging to the Querents Life; and
Origanus tells us, fol. 428., the Conſignificators
of this Houſe are Y, and h , this being the
firſt of Houſes ; h the firſt of Planets, and
Y the firſt of Signs; 2 joyeth in this

Law-Suits, Quarrels and Contenſions; it fig
nifies the Querents Friends and Aſſiſtants in
Eclipſes and Mundane Revolutions; it ſhews
the Kimi. Allies and Support of the
Kingdom; as alſo its Megazine. -
It iscalled by the Greeks, ºraçoe; it go

What the guerent & Queſted if , and
how tofind their Significator; 5 with an
Introdućiion to the #.ofall man
ner ofgueſtions.
Fºknow, that the word Querent, ſigni
fies no more, but that Man or Woman,
who propounds any thing to an Artiſt by way
of inquiry; the word comes from the Latin
#.and ſignifies the ſame with the Greek.
Zſlºw, to ſeek or inquire; ſo the queſted
is no more but the thing ſought , and that
doth ſpontaneouſly emerge from the ſame Ra
dix, and it is the ſame word by a Participle
of the Perfeót Tenſe, or Aoriſt.Prim. ZºlnSły,
queſttum, a thing ſought. -
In all manner of Queſtions, the firſt Houſe
fignifies the perſon inquiring, and ſhould ac
cording to the Rules of Art (and it will if the
figure be Radical) repreſent the Corporature,
Complexion, and Condition of the Querent, as
it is at the timeof asking, according to the
Nature of the Sign aſcending, and the Conſti
tution of the Lord thereof.
The Queſted, is liable to any one Houſe, as
if it be a Brother inquired after, then the
third Houſe and his Lord are his Significators;
if it be of a Sweetheart, then the ſeventh
Houſe, and hisLord are her Significators; if -
it
- (49)
|
it be of the Portion of the Wife, then the
eighth Houſe and its Lord, and ſo of the reſt ,
as you may obſerve by the Judgment of each
articular Houſe inthe precedent Chapter;and
in all Queſtions the Q is a general Significa
tor, both for the querent and queſted ; be
cauſe ſhe conveys the Influence of the other
Planets from one to another, and by conſe
quence to all perſons as they ſtand related to
the good or bad Influx of their Stars, and
for oneand the ſame Reaſon doth º and the
G ſignifie Foot-men , Letter-Carriers, and
News; not becauſe they have nothing elſe to
live upon, but becauſe they be the ſwifteſt
among theStars; and therefore they havebu
ſineſsin every ones Concerns; by which you
may ſee that Motion is the Author of
Aćtion.
Whether the Figure isfit to be judged.
Firſt, Conſider, that if the firſt or laſt de;
grees of a Sign aſcend, eſpecially in Signs of
ſhort Aſcention, the Artiſt ought to defer his
Judgment; for if few degrees aſcend, themat
ter is not yet mature for º:but if the
laſt degrees aſcend, either the party hath
been with others, or elſe the thing is not
ſerious. -
Alſo if the C be in via combuſta, themat
ter is dubious , and difficult to be Judged;
alſo if the D go to a DJ or 3 of h or dº,
either of them Lord of the ſeventh Houſe,
, eſpecially ifthe Aſpečt befrom Angles, let the
Artiſt take heed he doth notgetmore diſgrace
D by
r (50) .
by hisjudgment than heis willing to own; or
ºthelº of the ſeventh .*. , it
ſhews the Artiſt is not capable of giving an
authentick Judgment at that time.
If theſe thingsare not, the Artiſt may pro
ceed to Judgment, eſpecially if he find the
Figure to ſuit to the Queſtion propounded.
Some likewiſe ſay, that if the Lord of the
Aſcendant, and Lord of the Hour are of one
Nature, the Figure then Ere&ted is Ra
dical, &c.
How things are effečied or not effečied,
that are inquired after.
- All Queſtions unded carry with them
(if §:trº either a Negative
or an Affirmative ; and things are brought to
paſs divers ways, -
Firſt, when the Significators are applying
to each other by a cſ,Sk,or A Aſpećt (chiefly
with Reception) from amicable places of the
Figure,the thing inquired after is then brought
to paſs; itis alſo performed by Tranſlation,
and Colle&ion of Light, and by dwelling in
Houſes; and if theſe Aſpe&ts happen to be
from Angles, the matter will quickly be effe
&ted; if from Succedants, it will be more te
dious ; iffrom Cadents, after a long time and
much trouble. -
Secondly, by Tranſlation of Light ; that is,
when another Planet ſeparates from one, and
tranſlates his or her Light by good Aſped to
the other Significator ; and here note what
Houſe that Planet is Lord of, that ſo erº
- an
(51)
!
and applies, and that ſhews you what manner
of Perſon that is who ſhall perfeót the Buſ
neſs; if of the ſecond, your Money ſhall be
the beſt advocate; if of the third, a Brother
or Siſter; ifof the Fourth, a Father or ſome
cla Manor Woman, &c.
Thirdly, by Colleótion ; that is, when the
two Significators do caſt their rays by good
Aſpečt to ſome more weighty Planet than
themſelves; eſpecially if there be any Recep
tion between them.
Laſtly, although the Significators apply to
each other by D. or £5 yet if there be Re
ception between them, the matter propounded
is like tocometo a good Concluſion, although
with more difficulty and labour.
On the contrary, ifthe Significators do not
behold one another, and be in abjećt, places
ofHeaven, Combuſt, Cadent, Peregrine, or
in D or ſº, without Reception, orin of [] or
dº of the Infortunes,it isaſhrewdSign that the
matter propounded will be ſucceeded with an
ill Conſequence, or whenthe Dragonstailſhall
be in the Houſe ſignifying the matter ; theſe
things ſhew the matter cannot be affected.
How to vary your Figure accordingto the
matter propounded.
The Aſcendant or firſt Houſe ſignifies the
fife, &c. of the Querent; but being the ſe.
cond from the twelfth, the ſubſtance of your
private Enemies, and being the third fromthe
eleventh, the Brethren of Friends, and being
the tenth froſſ the ºr;the **:
... º. 2 -
y
(52)
ty, and Preferment of the Father; and ſo of
the reſt. - -
As, ſuppoſe a Man asketh concerning his,
wife; the ſeventh Houſe is her Aſcendant,
theeighth her ſecond, ſignifying herſubſtance;
the twelfth her ſixth , which ſhews her Diſea
ſes; the ſecond her eighth, which ſhews her
Death ; and ſo of the reſt. -
How longe're the Buſineſ; will be accom
pliſhed—if Probable.
Takethe diſtance ofyour Significators,either
of their Bodiesor Aſpećts,and turn the diſtance
into time,thus; ifthey are in Fixed Signs,every
degree gives a year or month ; if in Common
Signs, a degree gives a month or week ; ifin
MoveableSigns, a degree gives a weekor day.
Angles are equal to Moveable Signs, Succe
dants to common, but Cadent to fixed : So
that if you find yourSignificators in Moveable
Signs, and in Angles, you may be poſitive of
the Speed ofthe matter. -
Of the Moles andScars ofthe guerent
and gueſted.
The principal uſe of this, is only to help to
provea Figure Radical, when other Rules are
dubious; therefore,having ereóted your Fi
gure, obſerve the Sign aſcending, and what
i. in Man's Body that repreſents; and ſay,
n that part the Querent hath a Molé, Scar or
Excreſcence 3 if Y aſcend, it is about the
Head
(53)
}
Head or Face, if tºp on the Belly, &c. Theat
obſerve where the Lord of the Aſcendant is,
and there is another ; a third is diſcovered
by the place where the D is poſited, a fourth
in that part repreſented by the Sign of the
ſixth Houſe ; and laſtly, where the Lord of
the ſixth is poſited, there is another. -
If the Sign and Planet ſignifying the Mole
or Scar are Maſculine, then is the Mark, &c.
on the right ſide; if Feminine on the left ſide.
If the Significator of the Mole is above the
Earth, then the Mole or Scar is on the fore
part of the Body, and viſible; but if under
the Earth, thecontrary.
If few degrees of a Sign aſcend the firſt, or
deſcend on the ſixth, the aforeſaid Mole is in
the upper part of the Member ſignified by
that Sign ; but if the latter degrees of the
Signs be there , it is in the lower part of
that Member; and this is a certain Aphoriſm
that dº in the Aſcendant, either in a Queſtion
or Nativity , gives the Native or Querent a.
wound or Scar in his Face. -

for if an Infortune be in the ſixth, or in

the Lord of the ſixth caſting the ſame Aſpect
tothe Lord of the Aſcendant or the g, it is
to be feared that Servant is not honeſt, that
the Queſtion isasked of.

Then obſerve the application between the
Lord of the Aſcendant, the D, and the Lord
of the ſeventh, and the Planet to whom the G.
applies, as alſo the application of the G) and
g; if theſe apply to each other by a ¥or A,
the Marriage will be effected, chiefly if there
be Reception between them; but if they ap:
ply by tº or & without Reception, it will
never be effected without a Miracle ; if the
Figure be Radical.
Or if the Lord of the Aſcendant, the D or
9 are in the ſeventh Houſe, and the Lord of

great probability of effecting thematter.

if the Lord of the ſecond be in the ſeventh
Houſe, or on the Cuſp of the eighth, in * or

fourth Houſe, the Goods are not ſtoln, but
miſlaid or taken away in jeſt; by obſervin
what Planet the Lord of the Aſcendant la
ſeparated from, will ſhew how it was loſt or
miſlaid; if he ſeparated from il, it was
through much buſineſs; from h through
careleſsneſs ; if from 6', by reaſon of ſome
Paſſion or Quarrel, and ſo of the reſt.—
But if it be ſtoln, then obſerve theſe Brief
Rules; the Aſcendant ſignifies the Querent-,
the Lord of the ſecond the thing loſt; a Pe.
regrine Planet in an Angle or ſecond Houſe, or
Lord of the ſeventh, if they afflićt the lº,
º
(69)
of the ſecond, or GB, are Significators of the
Thief, if two or three are ſo poſited, and in
bicorporeal Signs, they ſhew more Thieves
than one ; if the Lord of the ſeventh be Pe
regrine in the Aſcendant, the Querent is the
Thief.-For hisAge, if hisSignificator be
Oriental in the beginning of a Sign, and the
& increaſe in light, he is young; if Occiden
tal, toward the end of a Sign, and the D de
creaſing, he is old.
For the Sex of the Thief,the Arabians teach
us, if the Sign aſcending, and Lord of the
hour are Maſculine, it is a Man, the contrary,
a Woman ; but I think it is beſt to examine
all the Significators, how they are poſited, and
judg by the moſt Teſtimonies, as you were
taught in the Judgmentof the fifth Houſe—
The Arguments of Recovery of the things
loſt, are the G) or D in the Ioth, in A to a
Planet in the ſecond, the G) and D above the
earth in Aſpe&t to the Lord of the ſecond, the
Lord of the 8th in the Aſcendant, l, Q, or
&b in the 11th 5 and I have known the Lord of
the 7th in 5’ to the Lord of the 8th, hath
reſtored the Goods again; but the Signi
ficator of the Thief going to Combuſtion, the
Thief is taken, and all diſcovered. . .
The greateſt Arguments of Irrecovery, are
T; , 3, or Q5 in the ſecond, the Lord of the
ſecond Combuſt in the 8th, in D or f to the
Lord ofthe eighth. . . -
But I would adviſe all young Artiſts to be
very careful how they meddle with things of
this kind; becauſe in matters of Theft, peo

//hat a Mativity is.
Nativity is nothing elſe but the exačt
A time of the Child's Separation from the
Womb of its Mother, and is called by the
Greeks Tévion, a beginning 3 and that part of
Aſtrology that doth exhibit this kind of Judg
ment is called by ſome Tevzºxtaxopia, becauſe
ir doth Predićtively diſcourſe all the Accidents
common to Mankind , diſcoverable in a Natu
ral way ; but becauſe no Nativity can be ta
ken ſo exačtly, but we find it admits of ſome
correótion by Accidents; therefore the Aſtro
loger always correóts his time , by his Acci
dents, and then conſtrućteth his Figure, which
he calls the true one, and then, proceeds
in his work; which is our following Buſineſs
to give Judgment of —- -

C H A P. II.
Of the length or Brevity of the Na
tiveſ Life.
Aving ſeriouſly conſidered the Figure of
H a Nativity, and the ſtrength and Debi
lities of the Planets, as you are taught Chap. 5.
Part the firſt,--the firſt Inquiry is , how
long may the Native live 2 for it is a piece
of madneſs to ſpeak any thing of Riches,
Marriage, Children, Honours, &c. when the
Native ſhall not live to a convenient age for
ſuch ačtions and injoyments. .
Therefore firſtconſider whether your Birth
be Diurnal or Noëturnal; if it be Diurnal, and
the Sun be found in the 7th, 9th,Ioth,or 11th
Houſe, he ſhall be giver ofLife, called by the
Greeks 'Acélow Aphata ; but if your Birth be
1Noćturnal, and you find the D in the 1ſt, 7th,
9th, 10th, 11th Houſe, ſhe ſhall be the giver
of life: But if both the Lights are under the
Earth, then the Horoſcope ſhall be admitted
giver of life, and what Planet hath moſt Digni
ties in the Horoſcope, place of the G) or D,
being givers of life, ſhall be the Alchocodin or
giver of years, ſo called from ºn Stella,
and the uſe of it in Nativities is this, ac
cording to the ſtrength or weakneſs of your
Alchocoden , ſo will the years of your life be
moreor leſs, which may be obſerved by this
Table, only by Inſpection.

The Arabians took the Alchocoden, i.e. the
Diſpoſitor of Hyltch or giver of life; for the
Principal Significator of life, -and Ptolomy
accepted of the Hyltch it ſelf for the ſame end,
and the diſtance between that and the moſt
dangerous interficient point,toſhew thelength
of the Natives life, I,ſaith Leovitius, am gene
rally uſed to dirtù the Aſcendant according to the
Succeſſion of Signs, to the *:::::::::::::: that
is, the malignant Planets or their ill Rays, and
not only to the malignant Stars, but to the
envious Radiation of any other, Planet who
hath power to kill, ſo that the degree of Di
rection ſhall happen in the term of that Planet,
who in the Radix was Significator of Death ,
i.that Planet is ſaid to ſignifie Death
who,

ether points and places which have power to:
... kill; that is to the Terms of the Malevolents,
or ofthem that be placed in the eighth Houſe,
or the Lord of the ſame. -
when it ſhall happen therefore that the
Aſcendant ſhall come to any of the aforeſaid -
places that have power to kill, that ſhall be
eſteemed a dangerous year to the Native;
hence it comes to paſs that there may be ma
ny dangerous years, if the Aſcendant may
cometo many of thoſe Interficient points, of
which years, that only ought to be accounted
the moſt dangerous, when the Promittor in
the Revolution, ſhall be joyned to the Lord
of Death, either by Body or Aſpe&t; and who
he is, you may learn by the three Rules fore
going.
Of Children that dyein their Infancy.
when the degree ofthe Aſcendant at Birth
is poſſeſs'd by a Malignant Star, having South
Latitude, eſpecially if he be Lord of the

Mºy (faith Leoviti) are the Opinions
--- of the Ancient and Modern Aſtrolo

in particular is moſt Authentick or better con
firmed by Phyſical and Philoſophical Reaſons,
I will not here diſpute ; but briefly call to
mind the chiefeſt of them, beſides my own.
Opinion, that it may be free for every man
to uſe that which he beſt approves of
Firmicus doth pronounce that Planet to be
Lord of the Nativity, who hath moſt Digni
ties in that Sign which the p enters into next.
after the Birth, St. and GS czcepted, wherein.
the Luminaries themſelves bear moſt Rule ;
as for Example, if the at the time of Birth,
were in til, then 3: ſhould he Lord of the
Nativity; becauſe, z is the next Sign, whoſe
Lord is 3%, this is an eaſie way to eleēt the
Lord of the Geniture; but I leave it to the
Judgment of others, to be lik'd or diſlik'd, as
they pleaſe.
Many do think that Planet to be Lord of.

five Hylegicals, that is in the Place of the G

opinion concerning the matter... that whar
ſoever Planet is found ſtrongeſt in Eſſentia H.
Dignity, and Poſition in the Figure, ought
to be eleēted Almutin or Lord ofthe Geniture;
but if one of thoſe Accidents only happen
to any Planet; ſo that he be in his Eſſential
Dignities, and yet ill placed in the Figure,
then you muſt accept of ſome other, who
by his good Poſition you ſhall Judge able to -
fhare with him in Government.
This Reaſon (beſides others which for bre
vity I omit) confirms this Method to me,
that thePlanet who is ſo conſtituted in the Ra
dix as aforeſaid, ought to be eſteemed Lord
of the Nativity; becauſe the Luminaries ſo
Poſited in their own Houſes, are not accepted
or taken for Lords of the Nativity, becauſe
of a ſingular propriety they have in the Judg
ment of almoſt all the A&tions or Paſſions of
Man's life : and as ſome Aſtrologers ſay, they
are half a Nativity. -
CHAP. Iv.
Of the Temperature and Complexion.
of the Body, -
T. is well known what the Natural Philo
ſophers. call Temperature or Complexion,
and that is according to the Dogmatiſts, an
ingenerate mixture of the four primary Hu
mours, i. e. Blood, Phlegm, Choler, and Me
kancholy; but according to the Learned §
- ! - - girl
(85)
giriſt, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, and of
theſe Humours there is an agreeable Compoſi
tion made, in ſuch ſort as it may agree to ſome
ſpecial kind,—and thereforethere are diver
ſities of Complexions, agreeing both to ſpe
cial kinds, and particular things.
Hence there is an Infinite diverſity of Hu
mours in Man's Body, both good and bad,
cauſed by the Conſtitutions of their Parents,
and the manifold mixtures of the Stars: Ne
vertheleſs, as there are four principal humours
in the Bodies of all living Creatures ; ſo there
are four principal Complexions correſponding
thereunto. Firſt, Sanguine, which is mo
derately hot and moiſt. Secondly, Phlegma
tick, which is cold and moiſt. Thirdly, Cho
lerick, which is hot and dry. Laſtly, Melan
cholick,which is cold and dry; and theſe four
Complexions are known by the proper qua
lities and natures of the Significators of the
Temperature, by their equal Compoſition, in
Collééting by a certain order, the Teſtimonies
of every one of the qualities, viz. of Hot Cold,
Moiſt,and Dry,as ſhall quickly be more plainly
ſhewed,—Therefore the Significators of
the Complexion are,
1. The Aſcendant and his Lord.
2. The Planet or Planets placed in the Aſcen
dant, or beholding the ſame with a Partile
Aſpect; among which the Q, and R5 are alſo
numbred. . -

6. The Lord of the Nativity.
The quality of theſe Significators, and of
the Signs in which theſe Significators are
placed, muſt be examined according to the
Doãrine following,— in which obſerve this,
that h, G', or the ºy beholding the Aſcendant

obſerve which exceeds, and Judge according
Iy of the Complexion; for if heat and moi
ſure doth exceed the other Qualities in *:

r
ber of Teſtimonies , the Native ſhall be San

f heat and dryneſs, Cholerick; and laſtly, if
cold and dry,Melancholick.
— Caution to the Student—In Col
letting the Teſtimonies of the four Qualities
aforementioned take this advice : When one .
Planet ſhall be Lord of the Nativity, and of
the Aſcendant, and placed in the Áſcendant,
he muſt be ſet down thrice in the Colle&tion
of Teſtimonies; ſo the -D, if ſhe ſhall be
placed in the Aſcendant, ſhe muſt be ſet down
twice; and ſo of the reſt. -
C HAP. v.
Of the Manners or Behaviour ofthe
Native.
Here is no doubt but that the Manners
! and Motions of the mind, and a great
part of the chief Aëtions of Men, and Con
tingeneies of this life, do follow the quality
of Complexion and Diſpoſition, and the old
Adage was true, which faith, every man fol
lows the firſt diſpoſition of his Nature—
Therefore in Judging the Manners and Con
ditions we obſerve, the ſame Significators.
which before are ſaid to have dominion over
the ‘ºwn-ºringt is Method:

:
Firſt,-If any Planet is really and locally
in the Aſcendant , in the ſame Sign, or any
other, Sign in the Aſcendant , from five de
grees before the Cuſp of the firſt Houſe, till
within five degrees of the cuſp of the ſecond;
the ſame ſhall be principaſ Significator of
Manners, yet his Diſpoſitor ſhalſ ſhare and
partake with him in the Signification there
of-Conſider alſo, that Planet that is Signi
ficator, with his Diſpoſitor; for if they ſhall
be Benevolent Planets in good Aſpeãs with
Benevolent Stars, and they fortunate, it ſhews
the Native is inſpired with a moſt gentlecour
teous humane Nature. -
But if thoſe Significators ſhall be Malevo
lent Planets, infº&ted with the Malignant Rays
of ill Stars, it giveth an evil moroſe Inclina
tion, with a Pºſy to evil;-alſo if a
Planet benevolent by Nature ſhall be Signifi
cator or Configurated with the Beneficks, and -
they weak, it makes the Behaviour and Condi
tions laudable and vertuous in their kind; yet
they will be obſcure, dubiousand ſimple,:-
ifa Malevolent Planet be Significator, and yet
ſtrong and well-placed, he gives good Manners
and a generous Spirit; yet for the moſt part
it .# the Intelle&t with ſome motives to
ill ačtions. - -
t; giveth Manners of the Nature of that
Planet he is in d with 3 but if he be in dº
with many, he partakes of his Nature who is
ſtrongeſt among them; but if he is joyned
to no Planet by Body or Aſpect, he takes the
lºſs of him in whoſe Eſſential Dignities
Č IS. - - --

the Q, followsthe Conſtitution of 3: , the
35 of H and 3; the Luminaries placed in
the Aſcendant, their Signification is general,
and partake of the Nature of their Diſpo
ſitors. -
Secondly,–If many Planets be in the
Aſcendant, they ſhall be all Significators, and
they will give variety of manners; yet he
who is ſtrongeſt ſhall exceed the reſt in the
effects of his Nature , and his Influence only
will be durable in the whole progreſs of the
Natives life ; the Nature of the others will
paſs away when the effe&ts of their Dire&tions
are paſt. -
Thirdly, if no Planet be in the Aſcendant,
ſee who is joyned to the D er 3, and Judge
accordingly; if many be ſo joyned, Judge as
you were taught in the precedent Rule
of many Planets in the Aſcendant; for he
who is ſtrongeſt ſhall be moſt durable in
his effects.
Fourthly, When no Planet is in the
Aſcendant, or joyned to the D or 3, take
the Lord of the Aſcendant, and according to.
his Nature, Judge of the Natives diſpoſition;
confidering alſo what Rays he receives from
his Diſpoſitor , or what Dignities either
of them have in the placeof the D and 3.
Fifthly, The Significators joyned to the
principal fixed Stars, of the firſt or ſecond
Magnitude, and near the Ecliptick, are won
derfully ſtrengthened in their Influence, and -
both the effe&s - of the Planet and Star
ſhall appear with a greater Splendor, in the
manners and Conditions of the Native,

Laſtly,–when theſe. Rules ſhall be ſo
equally balanced that a certain Judgment
cannot be given; the Lord of the Nativit
ſhall be Moderator, and according to his
“Nature, good or evil, frame your Judgment;
alſo if the Lord of the Aſcendant by Poſition
and Aſpećt fºall apply to the Significators of
his own Nature, the effects ſhall be the more
certain; for in ſome Nativities ſeveral oftheſe
Rules may beapplied at once : For Example,
If a Planet be inthe Aſcendant in A or k
to the D or º, or both , and beholding his
Diſpoſitor, here by reaſon of divers Teſti
monies, the Judgment is the more perfeót,
and the effects the more certain ; but if thou

From theſe Planets and their equal mixture
is the Judgment of Manners and Diſpoſition
produced ; but although the Luminaries are
not claſſically inſerted , É the conſideration
of them doth much explain and expound the
Inclination of Men and Women ; ſo the D.
agreeing with the Significators, ſhe increaſing
in light, doth illuſtrate their effečts; yet the
D Combuſt, or in her extreams of Latitude,
gives variety of Effečts, the G) ( correſpond
ing) with the Significators of manners, and he
, fortunate, gives gravity, fame, and renown;
but if weak, feeble and dull.
The great Cabaliſts of this Science tells us,
it is better to obſerve the Diſpoſitors of the
Luminaries, than the lightsthemſelves; for to
them they do commit (inthis thing) the Ef
fečts of their Nature. -
Hence it doth appear, that mans fate is not
neceſſitous and abſolute, but contingent and
voluntary;
(96)
voluntary; for the Stars work not upon the
Intelle& immediately, but upon the Humours,
and they communicate to the Senſes, and ſo
the Intelleå is inform’d, according to the old
Philoſophical Axiome, Nihil in Intellettu quod
nos prius fuit in ſenſu; and therefore if Man .
runs into an extream, it is not by compul
ſion of the Stars, for Agunt non Cogunt , but
from the Curſe upon Adam's Sin, that now .
lies heavy upon our Shoulders, our Senſes,
I ſhould have ſaid; but I muſt remember,
that I am now an Aſtrologer, and ſo I ought
to ſhew my ſelf: And therefore to my Bu
ſineſs. -

Of the form and Stature of the Body.
H*.finiſhed thoſe things that belong
to the Mind, I will next add ſome Con
ſiderations of the form and Stature of the
Body, which |..". is at this day darker
and more abſtruſe than the former ; becauſe
the Conſtitution of the form and favour of
-the Native, depends as well upon the Parents
and Progenitors, as upon the Coeleſtial Bodies;
and beſides that Seminal effect, the place of
Birth, Education, Diet and Exerciſe, doth
: alter the favour and form of the
Ody. -

Yet it is indubitable, but the well placin
of the Planets, do add much to the beauty an
luſtre of the Body; and on the contrary, the
ill placing of the Significators do disfigureand
as much deform the ſame.
I ſhall here omit the Deſcription of the
Planets and Signs of the Zodiack at large,
having given you that in the firſt Part, and
come dire&ly to give you the Rules, which
are as followeth.
The Stature of the Body is deſcribed by
the Aſcendant his Lord , and the Planet or
Planets beholding him, and the Planet or Pla
nets in the Aſcendant, together with the Lu
minaries and the fixed Stars, Take theſe
Rules for the Planets.

§ whether Oriental or Occidental partakes
of the Nature of his Diſpoſitor; but if hebe

the Houſes of the Lights, he partakes of the
Nature of the Sign he isin; and ſo of the Lu
F 2 mºlnarićS,
(1oo)
minaries, yet the Sun gives a large Body, the
.6 increaſing, gives a pretty tall ſtature , but
decreaſing a ſhort ill compoſed ;
The Stature of theSigns are briefly thus:
Y, 8, 2-, and in, give a mean ſtature, in
clining to tallneſs. -
Su, rºt, and 2,-tall.
ss, VP,and 9%, ſhort.
II, a tall ſtrait Body. -
::, a mean Body, rather ſhort. --
To this add theſe Cautions; Firſt, Q or §
from their Houſes or Exaltations, beholding
the Lord of the Aſcendant, give a tall ſtature;
in their Detriment and Falls, the contrary.
Secondly, h, 23, or 3 in Houſe or Exal
tation, give one kind of ſtature; Peregrine,
and Retrograde another ; therefore you muſt
mix your Judgment accordingly. ... "
And here I muſt diſſent from the Opinion
of the Learned Leovitius, who ſaith we ought
to negle&t the Sign aſcending in this kind of
judgment, and except only of the Lord of the
Aſcendant, and his Diſpoſitor ; I take, the
Sign aſcending,his Lord,and the (, , for princi
pal Significators, and I have good reaſon for
ſo doing. -
Concerning the Corpulency of the Body,
Authors are of divers minds and Opinions;
Ptolomy thinks it comes from South Latitude,
leanneſs from North Latitude. —I envitius
attributes it to the Signs, to which end heap
points the firſt half of Y, &, Sl. for groſs
neſs, , the latter half for leanneſs ; ſo II and

, the firſt part mean, the latter tending to groß
neſs; ?, the firſt part lean, the latter fat 3
tºp, ºr, &, and 96, give a mean proportion,
yet the latter partof: inclines to groſsneſs.----
But my opinion is, that fatneſs is cauſed by
the Q and the other Significators being po
ſited in moiſt and aery Signs, ingood Ray with
*l or ? ; , from whence is produced a good
digeſtion and fermentation; by which means
the Chyle is ſoon converted into an inflamable
Sulphureous ſubſtance.
Leanneſs is produced by thoſe Significators
poſition in earthy, Signs, in Aſpect with h .
and 3, from which is produced a ſharp accid
juice which cauſeth moſt ſtrong digeſtion,
and at ſome times, a violent fermentation ; ,
by which means the more inflamable part
of the thymus, in the 'ſecond and third di
geſtion is conſumed, and the other part.
precipitated , and is one cauſe of Obſtru
&tions: Hence it is that lean men have ge
nerally great Stomachs ; and all this may
appear by the preparation of Tartarum. Wi.

CHAP. VIII.
Ofthe Birth in general, and of ſome
* uſeful general Ruler,
Ecauſe the Effe&ts of the Stars are divers
and various, in producing mirth or miſe
ry toevery Native, I ſhall here #: you ſome
Rules (before I come to the re ºr
ſes in order) to know whether the Native will
be generally happy or unfortunatein the courſe
of É. life, and when ; for ſome live ſplendid
ly in their Youth, and beg in their old Age;
others live meanly in their Youth, and are
glorious at their Ends;butothers live famouſly
both in wealth and honour all their Days.
Therefore obſerve, –If in a Nativity four
Planets or more are Eſſentially ſtrong, in Houſe
or Exaltation ; or in mutual Reception from
the ſame Dignities; it ſignifies a moſt excel.
lent Fortune, and the Native ſhall be generally
fortunate in the ačtions of his whole life;—-
on the contrary, if many Planets ſhall be in
their Detriment, Falls, Peregrine, Cadent
and without Reception ; it makes the Native
Hive obſcurely, miſerably, and poor without
a Miracle.
Next let the Luminaries be conſidered, for
from their Poſition may the Artiſt drawnota

upon the cuſp of the tenth in 36 or A to 3:
or 9, and they ſtrong; but if Ó be then in
19 deg. of Y, it works wonderfully : theſe
are , all great Arguments of . Fortune ; but
if they are otherwiſe placcd, judge the
contrary.
But if ſome Stars are well dignified, and
others are ill dignified , , it gives a various
and unſetled fortune, chiefly if they are in
moveable Signs; the Q, Q , and 3, with 3:
and 9 above the Earth, makes the younger
years moſt fortunate ; but if under the Earth,
the latter part ofthe life will be more glorious;
But this chiefly depends upon the Direétions
of the moſt eminent Significators, to the
ſtrongeſt Promittors of wealth and Honour:
But remember this laſt Rule ; for it is moſt
certain, that h or 6 Peregrine in the Tenth,
or the Dragon's tail is in that Houſe, deſtroys
the Natives Honour, Credit, and Reputation;.
eſpecially if the Sun and Moon are in D to:
each other; but if this Poſition happens in.

Of malth and Rishº, the judgment of
the ſecond Houſe. .
He Ancient Aſtrologers have differed
much about the Judgment ofthis Houſe ;
Ptolomy takes his Judgment from the GB, and
from thoſe Planets who have dominion in the
place thereof; but the Arabians uſe otherMe
thods in this Judgment, whoſe diverſities of
Opinions I ſhall here omitt, I being in this
place deſigned rather to perform things for
Frofit than Speculation ; and therefore I ſhall
endeavour to lay down the moſt authentick
Rules, delivered both by the Ancient and Mo
dern Aſtrologers in theſe particulars.—
And for the Benefit of the young Student ,
I will be more large in the Judgment of this,
Houſe, than any before me have been ; be
cauſe it is the moſt uſeful part of this Science,
in all kind of Predićtions; for there can be
no great advancement, but Riches are annexed
as a Companion to it: Hence it is that Riches
are but the Produćt of Dignity, Honours,
the favour of Princes, Marriage, &c. There

What is the ſignification of the twelve
Houſes, I have already ſhewed you at large in
the eighth Chapter ofthefirſt Part; and there
fore Pſhalfforbear all further mention of them
here, and refer you to its proper place.
Now to return to our laſt Queſtion propo
ſed, i.e. By what means, &c. and ſo improve
this Dočtrine laſt mentioned.
Therefore if you would Judge by what
means Gain, or Loſs of Eſtate ſhall happen to
the Native, Behold the Significators as you
were dire&ed in the firſt Propoſition, and ſee
if be fortunate or unfortunate; if all the
Significators are fortunate (which isvery rare)
then Judge the Eſtate or Riches ſhall come by
ſuch Perſons and Things which thoſe Planets
fignifie, and the Houſe they are in; alſo the
Planets that behold them with good Rays,
and what Houſe or Houſes thoſe Planets are
Lords of.--So on the contrary, if the Sig
nificators are unfortunate, Judge of the loſs
of Eſtate, or that theNative ſhall be kept Poor
by ſuch Perſons and Things which thoſe Pla
nets and Houſes have Signification of.-
For Example.
Suppoſe 6 to be Lord of the ſecond,
frong in the ſecond, in A or >k with Recep
tion of T. or $ in the eleventh Houſe, the
Native ſhall have very Honourable Friends,and
ſuch as ſhall vigorouſly endeavour to advance
his Intereſt, and that the Native ſhall be im
ployed as a Steward or Treaſurer to ſome
Prince er Nobleman ; or in a more *::::

fice, &c. but if the Pars fortune ſhall be in:
of with 3, and both in D to their Diſpoſitor,
and ſhe $, and in the fifth Houſe ; then the
Eſtate is conſumed by Drinking and Whoring,
and ſuch like 5 but if with h, and he in the
ſixth Houſe, then by Melancholick Diſeaſes, ill.
Servants; loſs by ſmall Cattle, if a Countrey
man; and ſo of the reſt of the Significators;
If you find them fortunate, Judge Wealth and
Riches; if unfortunate Poverty : But the time,
when theſe things ſhallhappen muſtbe known
by the good or bad Direáions of thefive Hyle
gicals to their ſeveral Promittors, eſpecially of
the GB , and take good notice of that dire
&tional Body or Aſpećt which falls in the ſe
cond Houſe; for whether the Significator be.
the Aſcendant G), ), or GB, it ſhall have great.
Signification in the Eſtate of the Native,
according to the Quality of it, whether good
or bad.
Sometimes alſo it happens that the Signifi
cators are equally balanced in the terms of
good and bad; in ſuch a Caſe the Native ſhall,
live ſtruggling with his fortune all his days,
ſometimesunder a good Direčtion, he ſhall get
ſomething, and by and by, under a bad one,
... he ſhall loſe all again.
PROP.”
(113)
P R O P. III.
Shall the Native gain Riche, by juſt
- or Unjuſt meanſ ?
Tº Judgment of this Particular alſo, is
: taken from the Poſition and Quality of
the Significators, whether good or evil, and
that Significator is called good or benevolent,
which is placed in the Dignities of a Benefick
Star, althcugh of his own Nature heis evil—
when the benevolent Planets are Significators,
and not afflićted with the Malignant Rays of
Th or 3, nor in cſ with any violent fixed
Stars, it ſhews the Native ſhall gain Riches by
lawſul means; -- but, if a Malevolent Star.
ſhall be Significator, and not indued with
benevolent Rays, it ſhºws the contrary; eſpe
cially if it be one of the Superior Stars, and
either Retrograde or Combuſt. -
If a fortunate Planet is Significator, and
yet placed in the Dignitics ofan evil one ; it
ſheweth the Native to get Riches both by law
ful and unlawful means; if Retrograde or
Combuſt, the ſame; Likewiſe if a Malevolent
be Significator, and yet placed in the Dignities
of a good Planet, it ſignifies the ſame:– thus
far Leovitius, the truth of all is indeed,
if the two Infortunes h and 3, , or either of
them happen to be Significator of ſubſtance,
and ſtrong; and there be other Arguments of
greatneſs in the Nativity, and the two Infor.
tunts

º
(114)
tunesarethe moſt potent Stars among them,
affiting thefortunes it or Q fromfiery Signs;
the Native ſo born ſhall be Prodigious in his
fortune, laying about him on every ſide, and
asking no Queſtions for Conſcience ſake; but,
trfas autnefits, if it pleaſeth his humour it is
lis own; ſometimes it is a point of Equity,
othertimes it is for Neceſſity, Religion, Secu
rity of his own, &c. on the contrary, if x:
or 2 are Significators of Riches, and free
from the ill Rays of h, and 3, and in their
Eſſential Dignities, or the Q well placed and
fortunate in g or good Aſpeč of the Lord
of the Aſcendant; the Native is juſt, mer
ciful, anda hater of all baſe unjuſt ačtions.
. Many more Rules are delivered by the An
cientsin the Judgment of this Houſe, which
becauſe I judge them rather burthenſom than
uſeful, I do here omitt, and think this here
delivered to be ſufficient, if carefully con
ſidered. —
P R O P. IV.

T this caſe you muſt obſerve—

ſame Dignities, it promiſes a peaceable and
quiet enjoyment of their Eſtatesall their days,
but if he be weak and unfortunate, it brings
many Troubles and Perplexities.
If it be an Infortune in the ſecond, yet if he
be fortunate and ſtrong there (the ºf except.
ed) it preſerves the Natives Riches by a kind
of imperious violence ; eſpecially if he be in
a Regal Sign 5 but ifhe be weak and unfortu.
nate, it diſſipates the Natives Eſtate ſtrangely,
according to the nature of the afflićting Pla
net; as if 8, by Diſeaſes and common Croſſes
in the world ; if 3, by Quarrels and Con
tentions, perhaps Whoring; if the Dragons
Tail, by ſlanderous Reports, from whence
come Quarrels and Law Suits, Et ſic de
Četeriº,
But if many Planets, are in the ſecond
Houſe, then you muſt ſeriouſly examine who
be Fortunes and Fortunate, and who Infor
tunes and Unfortunate; and alſo the ſtrength
and poſition ofthe Lord of the ſecond Houſe;
for I know a Perſon now living, who from
nothing got ſome Hundreds, and yet had h
and the ºy in Dowo ſecunda, and H Peregrine
there alſo. - -
Secondly, if you find no Planet in the ſe
cond Houſe, ſee to the Lord of the ſecond
Houſe, and the Diſpoſitor of the 633 for if
they ſhall be ſtrong and fortunate, in good
places of the Figure, and in good Aſpett
with x or Q, and they ſtrong, it ſheweth
the continuance of Riches to the lifes end ;
on the contrary, if they are in ill Aſpetts.
of the Infortunes from obſcure places of the
Figure, ſhews, the Native ſhall never *:
- 3.
**
(116) º
able to get an Eſtate, nor yet to keep what
is given him. -
Sometimes it happens that ſome ofthe Sig
nificators are ſtrong, and yet that may be
over-balanced by ſome evil poſition that may
obſcure their Energy, and from thence will be
produced a continual influx and deflux in the
Natives Eſtate, what is gotten under a good
Dircótion, is loſt under an evil one, and his
labour is only continued to his lives end with
hopes. - . -
But to know in particular when theſe
things, ſhall happen, you muſt obſerve the
Direétions ; for they are the only digiti to
point out the quando, when ; yet for thoſe
who require a more general way to know in
what part of the Natives life the Eſtate ſhalf
approach or decline, let itbeobſerved in what
quarter of Heaven the Significators areplaced;
for if they are between the firſt and tenth
Houſes, it ſhews the Native to get an Eſtate
in his Minority, perhaps by gifts; if between
the tenth and ſeventh, at Man's eſtate, or full
grown years ; if between the ſeventh and
fourth in his declining years; but if between
the fourth Houſe and Aſcendant , in the laſt
part of his life, not long before Death. Like
wiſe the Significators Oriental direét, ſwift in
courſe, and in the Oriental Quadrants ſhews
Riches to come in the younger years; but if
Retrograde, ſlow in motion, and Occidental,in .

Sheweth the judgment on the fifth
Houſe.
°. Tº: Judgment of this Houſe gives an ac
count of the Natives Children, whether
few or many,long liv'd or ſhort ; and I will di
vide the Judgment hereofintotwo Heads,viz.
1. Shall the Native have Children, or not *
2. Shall they dye young, or live to years
more ripe and perfeót 2.
The Significators are the Aſcendant and fifth
Houſes with their Lords, and the Lord of the
eleventh; theſe duely conſidered, you may
give an Anſwer to the firſt §.
The Cuſpsof the firſt and fifth poſſeſt by fruit

many Children.

The Lord of the fifth in Aſpećt with ?,
and ſhe and the D in L1 to dº, gives Children;
but they ſometimes prove Baſtards, 3 inthe
eleventh (which is the fifth from the ſeventh)

pable of bearing Children quomiam deftius ºft

Houſe, the Native is barren, whether Man or
Woman, non habens vim generandi ; but the
Ilord of the firſt, fifth, or the eleventh, with
the D in fruitful Signs, gives the Nativea ve
ry plentiful Iſſue; eſpecially if they are inany
of their Houſes, or in good Aſpect with Re
ception. -
But beſides Radical poſitions, there ought
to be conſidered the Parents of the Native,
good Directions eſpecially of Q , which
oft-times provokes the aëts of Venery, with
viſible ſucceſs. --—
Secondly, Shall they dye young, or live
to older years.
' ' The Significators before-mentioned in good
Aſpe&t with the fortunes from good places of
Heaven, the Natives Children live, thrive, and
are ſolike to continue; but if weak and affli
&ted, the contrary. -
The Lord of the fifth in D or 5’ to H or
{6, or Lord of the eighth or 12th, the Chil
dren" ſive not long; h, 3, and Ry in the

fifth or eleventh, the ſame; the G) or D in
the fifth, in Li or & to h or 3, deſtroys
the Natives, Children; if x or ? hap to
Lords of the fifth , and in 5’ to H or 6,
the Children dye in their Minority.
But to know whether the Natives Children
ſhall be Males or Females, you muſt colle&
the Teſtimonies ofthe Significators, and judge
by the greater number; for if the Sign aſcend
ing, and the Sign of the fifth are Maſculine
Signs,
Signs, and their Lords Maſculine Planets, and
they and the D in Maſculine Houſes and Signs,
the Natives Children ſhall be Males; if in Fe.
minine, the contrary. -
C H A. P. XIII.
Shewing the judgment belonging to the
fixth Houſe , i. e. of Sickneſ; and
Servantſ.
LL Men that live in the world are ſub-.
jećt at ſome time or other to Sickneſs
and Diſeaſes; and all Diſeaſes, in a general'
way , are to be known by theſe Significators
following:
1. The Aſcendant and his Lord.
2. The Luminaries, but chiefly the D.
3. The ſixth Houſe, and the Lord thereof:
4. The Planet or Planets poſited in the ſixth.
In every one of theſe Significators, two
things muſt be conſidered ; Firſt, whether it
be fortunate or weak ; Secondly, whether it
be free from the Malignant Rays of h and & 3.
for if all theſe Significators, or the greateſt
part of them ſhall be ſtrong and free from
the Malignant Rays, of the Malevolents, it
ſhews a ſtronghº conſtitution of Body;
but on the contrary, if they ſhall be afflićted
and oppreſſed of the Malevolents, they make
s - G 3 the
the Body ſickly , unhealthful, and a perfeót
Repoſitum of Diſeaſes.
The Lord of the Sixth fortunate, the p
ſtrong and in good Configuration with the
Lord of the ſixth , and both beholding the
Aſcendant and his Lord, 3% or Q in the ſixth
fortunate, give a moderately healthful Conſti
tution of Body; but if the ſixth Houſe, his
Lord, and the Q ſhall be Combuſt, Peregrine,
afflićted of h, g’, or Q3, it ſhews, the contra
ry,-—in which obſerve,"—that theſe ill Con
figurations hurt moſt in, or, from Angles,
and a Partile is worſe than a Platick Aſpect ;
for Example, the Q , in ſº in 3P to h in Y,
if the 3’ be Partile, it gives the Gravel in the
Kidneys, or perhaps the Stone, if there are
other Arguments of Petrification ; but if it be
a Platick Aſpect, it gives only a weakneſs in
the Reins,Hypochondriack Melancholy, &c. if
from Angles it is the worſe;but worſt ofall from
the firſt and ſeventh , and theſe ill Aſpects are
more Malignant when they are applying, than
when they are ſeparating; and ſo in the reſt.
The kinds of Diſeaſes are known from the
Nature of that Significator, which is either
weak or afflićted of the Malevolents. Secondly,
by the Nature of the Sign that Significator
poſſeſſeth. Thirdly, by the Nature of the
Planet afflićting the Significator , either by
Body or Aſpect. And Fourthly, from the Nå

The young Artiſt' muſt not think that any
Planet, being Significator, will give all the
Diſeaſeshegoverns; but he muſt examine the
Nature ofthe Sign, the place of Heaven, and
the Aſpeã to the Luminaries. For Example.
h Significator of a Diſeaſe Combuſt of the
Sun in the ſixth Houſe, doth only give the
Leproſe, Canker, or ſuch putrid Diſeaſes, and
ſo of the reſt : it cannot be expe&ted I ſhould
be particular in a ſpecial Judgment in this
place; let it ſuffice that I endeavour to ſhew a
Íhort way how to frame Judgments fit for all
Nativities.
By this Method (theSigns being conſidered
... which here for brevity I omitt,
and refer you to the firſt part) you may judge .
in general what Diſeaſes the Native is like to
ſufferby. Eut thoſe things that have a parti
cular reference to violent accidents or parti
cular Calamities; as falls from on high, fire,
blindneſs,vices ofthe tongue,lame,crooked,3-c.
require a ſpecial conſideration, and arejudged
by Aphoriſms; of which I hope to ſpeak in
its proper place. --

6f Marriage, it being the principal judg
ment of the ſeventh Houſe.
B’.Marriage, I mean that dual Unien of
which we have an Example in the Con
jugality of our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, and
may infer a Mandate , ſince our Saviour ſaid,
Ltt every man have his own Wife, and every
woman her own Husband ; and it is ſaid plain
ly, that two ſhall be one fleſh, inſeparably
joyned- But beſides this Holy authority, the
reading of MoraſHiſtory informs us, that the
more every Nation had of honeſty and whol
ſom Laws, by ſo much the more they reſpe
&ted Marriage, and with the greater ſeverity
puniſhed outragious Luſt and Whoredom ;
thereforethis Judgment of Marriage is only to
be underſtood of this before-mentioned Sacred
Method of Union;––– and not of that con
fuſed order praćtiſed among the Barbarians,
Turks, and the greateſt part of Africa, that, -
one Man may have many wives; nor doth it
relate to thoſe Countries or Perſons who are:
conſtrained to live an impure ſingle life ; to
ſuch Places and Perſons this, Dočtrine is uſe
leſs ; and therefore it takes place only in thoſe
Countries where the Law allows Man's arbi
trium liberum a choice, freely either to Marry
one Woman, or forbear all. -
And: .
(134)
And this Judgment of Marriage hath many
Circumſtances, and differently pertain. to
Men and Women; and I ſhall accordingly
dividethem into twoparts, and firſt intreat of

3. Shall he Marry in his Youth, or his

But in the Configurations of fi with the
Significators, obſerve whether they or he are
ſtrongeſt ; for if h be ſtrongeſt, then, the
Rule isonly applicable; but if the D or Q,or
the other Significators ſo Configurated be

cation is, if h be elevated above the D and 2,
and the contrary 3, the Reaſon is this, becauſe
the D and 2 do virtually advance thoſe Vene
real excitements which incline Men to Marry,
and therefore eitherof them unhappily joyned

This Rule is general, for you myſt obſerve
all the Significators of Marriage, which if you i -
find them in fruitful Signs, as GS, in, X, not
afflićted, they uſually give many Wives; but
if in Barren Signs, the contrary, but above
all the Significators obſerve the Cuſp of the
ſeventh Houſe; the D, and Q ; for theſe two
Planets have the greateſt ſway in the Mar
riages of Men; ſo that either of them in
, the 7th in a double-bodied Sign, in a good
ray with the other in a watry Sign, gives
many Wives.
The ſeventh Houſe a fruitful Sign, the Lord
ofthe ſeventh in a fruitful Sign, in 33 or A

w Queſt. 5. How Qualified ?
. Thisjudgment is grounded more uponApho
riſms and ſpecial Precepts, than upon a uni
verſal Dočtrine; yetthus much in general ob
ſerve, when the number of Wives ſhall be
known, by the Planets beholding the , );
within Orbs, and the D, yet applying ; then
conſider the Nature of the Planet or Planets,
ſo beholdingthe D by d or other Aſpect; and
- according
(139)
according to the Nature of thoſe Stars,judge
of the Quality and condition of the wife; as:
followeth:
h Significs one (if fortunate) whois grave,
reſerved, full of knowledge,abórious and pain
fu! ; but if unfortunate, froward, ſuſpicious,
jealous, cnvious, and ill-conditioned enough.
3: fortunate, ſignifies a Wife meek, chaſt,
modeſt, diſcreet, juſt and faithful, governing
her houſe with prudence ; ah, how few men
are ſo well-wived but unfortunate, ſhe is
unperfºt in all theſe Vertues; yet not bad
enough to be vicious.
3 fortunate, gives a Wife of an imperious
Spirit, one that can bear nothing of wrong ,
deſirous of revenge, willing to rule, nay,
rather than fail, her Husband; haſty, &c., but
unfortunate, evil-minded, proud, though beg
garly, ſtubborn, inſolent, never quiet Cxcept
ſhe is aſleep, given to ſcolding, and ſhe is a
true Emblem of Xantippe, the contentious
Wife of poor Socrates. -
2 – fortunate, gives one beautiful, courte
ous, gentle, mild, honeſt, pleaſant in her car
riage and language; unfortunate, the ſame in
a leſs degree; but if joyned to 3 by [1, 32;
or cy, and both Peregrine, it gives a damn'd
drunken Whore.
§ fortunate, ſignifies, a Wife of an ingº
nious fancy, apt for any buſineſs, witty, well
ſpoken, circumſpe&t, and skilful in things bc
longing
(140)
longing to one of herplace; unfortunate, craf
ty, ſubtile, a lyar, diſſembler, ſaying one
thing, and meaning another , unſtable, ma
licious. -
The Luminaries are not confidered in this
kind of Judgment, for theſe things here de
livered, have Signification of the Inclination
and mind of the Wife; but the G) and D.
beingthe great and only Lights of the world,
have Signification of more popular ačtions:
But if the Artiſt is willing to examin the
form and ſtature of the Wife, let him con
ſider the Dočtrine of the ſeventh, Chapter,
where he may find Satisfaction without fur
ther Inſtrućtion. - -j
For the Wealth and Riches of the Wife,
conſider, the ſame Configurations which are
laſt mentioned, viz. thoſe Planets which by g.
or any other Aſpećt, behold the D, ſhe being
fill in application; for if that Planet or Pla.
nets ſhall be beneficial and ſtrong, they de
ſign a Wife Rich, of good blood and de
ſcent, &c, but Malevolent and weak, the con
trary. Likewiſe, Benevolent Planets in
the 7th Houſe,ſtrong and fortunate, ſhew rich
and famous Wives; but if weak, honeſt plain
Women; the Malevolents in the 7th Houſe
ſtrong, ſhew rich Wives, but they are Women
of depraved minds; and this is the moſt Con
ciſe way ofjudging the Quality of Wives in
generalſ, and the moſt exact way in common
Pračtice; but beſides this, there are ſome
ſpecial Rules, and they are as followeth,
The Lord of the ſeventh in the tenth,or the
Lord of the tenth in the ſeventh, do promiſe
famous Wives, -
The
(141)
*
The Lord of the ſeventh in the ſecond, or
the Lord of the ſecond in the ſeventh, give
rich and wealthy Wives.
The Lord of the ſeventh in the twelfth, or
the Lord of the twelfth in the ſeventh, gives
a poor ſervile Creature, andone of no Eſti
tºmation. -
The D or 2 in Y, 8, Šl, WP, X, ſhews
a laſcivious Wife, eſpecially if ſhe be in ill
Aſpećt of 3 ; in the other Signs Continent.
The D and $ in Signs of Pulchritude, as .
II, 7, &, X, ſhews one fair and beautiful 5
in Signs of Deformity, as 'Y', 8, §5, §l, mº,
WP, one more foul and uncomely.
b, Lord of the 7th, and in the 7th, give
an old Wife, or one in years.
D. ſeparated from 3 and applying to 2 in
the Occident, gives a plurality of Wives, D,
in the Aſcendant in a malefic Ray of of the
ſame ; ſo Y and Q afflićted.
The Luminaries beholding one another with
beneficial Rays, ſhew Concord and Agreement
between Man and Wife.
Queſt. 6. Of the Agreement between the
Native and his Wife.
f
In this Queſtion, Conſider the Planet or
Planets that ſhew the number of Wives,
by the Dočtrine preceding; which if they
are Benevolents, and behold the (, with a
good Aſpećt, they promiſemutual love, plea
ſant and humorous converſe, good will, and
general content: —Butifa Malevolent behold .
- - h trary. ..
the Q withan ill Aſpe&t, the con {ikewiſe
(142)
Likewiſe if a Benevolent Planet beholds the
j) with an evil Aſpett, or a Malevolent one
with a good Aſpe&t, they are equal in effect,
and do give great diſcontent between the Man
and his Wife. -
There are many other Rules to judge this
particular by ; which becauſe they are more
prolix than profitable I here omitt; becauſe
my deſign is brevity, and will inſert only one,
which is to compare the Nativities of both
Perſons together ; for if you find F. and gº in
one Nativity affićting the places of the Lights
in another, thoſe perſons ſeldom or never
agree; but where both their Nativities cannot
be had, this kind of Judgment may be ſer
viceable. -
Of the Marriages of Women.
And their Significators are, -
1. The G) and 3 , for theſe two bear the
greateſt ſway in the Marriages of Women, and
have the ſame Signification that the 9 and 2
have in Mens. -
2. The ſeventh Houſe and his Lord.
3. The Planet or Planets in the ſeventh
Houſe. ~ : * > -
Hence is your Judgment drawn after the
Method as you were taught in the Nativity of
a Man ; only obſerve, that here you muſt al
lowthe G) and 3 the ſame Energy and Power,
which before was attributed to the D; and Q,
and then your Conſiderations and udgment
will emerge in the ſame Method as you were -
before direéted in the Marriages of Men,_
But -
!
(143)
But above all, both in Mens and womens,
obſerve the Strength and Debility of the Sig.
nificators, their agreement and diſagreement
withor againſt Marriage; always remembring
that a Planet in the Houſe ſignifying the mat.
ter, if he have any Dignity there, or Recep
tion with other Planets, is to be preferred
before the Planet, who is Lord of that
Houſe and weak; but if the Lord of that
Houſe be there, it exceeds all, and admits of
noexception. ." -

In this Queſtion conſider the ninth Houſe,

Lord of the , ninth in the firſt; or if they
are in 3 in the firſt or ninth, the ſame—
when theſe Significators ſtall be in the
Houſes of the Č and g; it likewiſe ſignifies
Travels.
Therefore (according to this Doãrine)
where many Significators of Travel are ap
parent and applicable, that Native ſhall under
take ſeveral Voyages or Journeys; but if con
trary, few or none; for if none of theſe Rules
take place , then will the Native dwell at
home, and ſpend his days in his own
Countrey.

2. To what Part of the World 2
If you find the Native ſhall Travel, then
this Queſtion is reſolveable; to which end,
obſerve,
-

obſerve, the Planets who ſignifie Journeys, and
the Signs of the Zodiack where they are pla
ced, with theSign of theninth Houſe.
If the Significators are in Y, Slor £,in the
Oriental part, he Travels Eaſtward. *
If in II, º, or :, in the Occident, he
Travels Weſtward.
If in 8, 1%, or vp, near the Meridian, he
Travels South ; but if in SS, in, or 36, near
the Inum cali, he Travels Northward. -
But if g is your principal Significator, ob
ſerve what Planet he is joyned to, for he is of
a convertible Nature, for joyned to Planets,
and they Oriental in his Dignities, ſo is he 5
and ſo of the reſt;—But if he is joyned to
the Luminaries, it is not ſo but the contrary,
that is, hepartakesof their Nature, if in their
Dignities; and having colle&ted all your Ar
guments, judge by the greater Number of Te
ſtimonies. -
Thirdly, Shall his journey be Fortunate
- or 'Unfortunate 2
when the Significators ſhall be with Bene
volent Stars, or in good Aſpećt with Reception
or in Reception without Aſpečt, or in good
Houſes, they give Proſperous, Honourable,and
Happy Journeys ; But if they ſhall be joyned
to the Malevolents by Body or envious Ray,
or in bad Houſes, they involve the Native
into many Dangers and Troubles both of Bo
dy and Eſtate.--—
If h or 3 are the afflićting Planets, they
ſhew peril by Thieves, Cheating, Captivity,

unlucky Navigations, Rains, great Waters; if,

Of the Natives Religion,
I do not mean by Religion,to diſcourſehere
concerning the Myſteries of Grace and Faith ;
nor yet to diſcover whether heſhall be a Soci
nian , an Arminian, or a Calviniſt; but to
ſhew how the Native will be inclined by the
effe&ts of ſecond cauſes, to Honeſt, Pious, Vir
tuous, and Religious ačtions, or on the con
trary to baſe, perfidious, unchriſtian-likeirre
ligious courſes in his common Society among
men.
... For it is manifeſt by Examples in many
Nativities, that h. 3, or 35 in the 9th or 3d
Houſes, in Moveable Signs, x beingthen Pe
regrine, in his Fall, or Detrimeut afflićted of
the Infortunes, the Native then born ſhall not
perſevere in one Religion, but often waver
from one to another, and never continue long
in any, nor yet dye a Martyr. But if 33, Q,

one that is zealous, conſtant, and faithful, and
a lover of good , and good men,-But the
G), ( , g, and 63 in theſe places, ſhew but

ſlothful, ſluggiſh, if 3 he is proud, imperious

if the D or #, he is Idle, Crack-brain'd, a
Drunkard.
In my Praćtice I do not oppoſe theſe Rules,
but obſerve a proſpect beyond theſe, and that
is of the whole Figure in general; for with
out doubt, if three or four Planets are eſſen
tially ſtrong , the Native cannot be poor nor.

ever his Significators are poſited, this is my
way of judging Gain and Advancement after t

Of the Natives Friends,
A'. we may for the more eaſe to the
TA Readers Memory, divide the Judgment
into three Queſtions.
I. Shall he have Friends or not 2
2. How ſhall they be qualified ?
3. Shallthey be faithful and durable 2.
Firſt, Shalſ he have Friends or not 2 and in.

Lord the Planet or Planets poſited there, and
: Ray they caſt to the Lord of the Aſcen
ant,
3, G), º, ø, or C, ſtrong in the eleventh
gives many, and thoſe eminent and faithful
Friends,the 4% is counted for a Fortune in
this kind of Judgment, and by being in the
eleventh, doth augment the good Signification
of the other Planets.
But iftheſe Planets are weak,they give many
Friends, as before; but they are poor and
unable to help in time of Neceſſity, having.
will, but wanting power toaſſiſt the Native.
The Malevolents hand 3 in the eleventh
ſtrong, ſhew many Friends ; but for the moſt
part feigned and Counterfeit ; but if they are
there weak and unfortunate, they ſhew but
few Friends, and thoſe moſt wadiº
(161)
faithleſs, and to them ſo qualified, the Dra
gons rail is equal. -
Mean Planets, as the G), D, 3, and gº in
the eleventh fortunate, ſhew many Friends of
a mean ſtate, but yet faithful; but if unfor.
tunate, few Friends, and thoſe unfaithful and
unſtable.
If many Planetsof a contrary Nature, ſhall
be in the cleventh , they ſignifie a mixture
and diverſity of Friends ; but the principal
judgment is taken from the ſtrongeſt of
them -
When no Planet is in the eleventh or firſt
Houſe, conſider the Lord of the eleventh,
whether he be a Malevolent, or a Benevolent,
ſtrong or weak , and what Planets he is in
Aſpeat with , and thence judge of the Num
ber of Friends. . -
-
Secondly, How ar. they qualified ?
This is known from the Nature of the Pla
net or Planets in the eleventh or firſt Houſes,
if any be there, and from the Lords of the
firſt and cleventh Houſes. . . º:
If h be in the eleventh ſtrong, or Lord of

Thirdly, Willtheir Friendſhip bedurable?
This is knownfromthe Sign or Signs in the
cleventh Houſe, whether Fixed, Moveable
or Common, or in what kind of Signs the
Significators, or the Lord of the eleventh is
poſited, whether Fixed or Moveable;—for
if they ſhallbe in Fixed Signs, in good Aſpeat
with the D or Planets in Fixed. Signs, the
Natives Friend will befaithful; otherwiſe not;
The Lord of the firſt in good Configuration
withthe Lord ofthe eleventh from eachothers
Dignities, or by Reception, whetherin Fixed
Signs or not, the Natives Friends are kind and
loving to him, and ſhew Reſpeſt ſuitable to
their quality.
But the beſt way in my Opinion to know
the Agreement or Diſagreement, is by compa
ring the Nativities of two Perſons together,
and thence judge, for if the Aſcendant of one
is the eleventh Houſe in the other, or ºl, in
one, on the place of the Sun or 6 in the

ofthe Natives private Enemieſ.
Tº: twelfth Houſe gives Judgment of pri
vateEnemies, and Impriſonment of the
Native; and I will divide them into theſe three
Heads or Queſtions,—viz.–
1. Shall he have private Enemies?
2. Shall the Native, orthey prevail? ..
3. Shall the Native be ſubjećt to Impri
ſonment, or not 2

in the Judgment of the ſeventh Houſe, which
takes notice of publick Enemies in general; H
ſhall therefore give you a full account in the
Judgmentof this Houſe, how to judge of both.
| publick and private Enemies, and I do the ra
ther give you the Judgment here 3 becauſe
private Enemies always hurt more than pub
lick ones; ºbeing known, aman is able to
provide againſt their malice; butprivate Ene
mies are like the Plague, (but of a worſe Con
ſequence) which flyes in at our Windows in

he
(164)
Houſes, he ſhall have Enemies alſo, but
he is wounded; therefore the aſſiſtance of A
ſtrology ought not to be contemptible in this
particular; for although it is not able to name
our Enemies, yet it can give us ſuch an ac
count of their Stature, Complexion and Qua
lity, that by the help of care and obſervation,
we may be able to know them ſufficiently for
our own ſatisfaction, and then the old Adagy
adviſeth us how to uſe our knowledge premo
nitus, premºnitus.
Firſttherefore, Shall the Native have
Enemier * * -
This Judgment of Enemies is taken from
the ſeventh and twelfth Houſes, from their
Lords, and the Planet or Planets poſited in
ºne, with the Planets in 5’ to the O
and D.
If many Planets ſhall be in the ſeventh or
twelfth Houſes, it ſhews many Enemies to the
Native; but if no Planets are in theſe Places,
and the Luminaries free, they ſhew few or no
Enemies.
The Q5 in the ſeventh Houſe, always gives
Troubles and Vexations, and that to pur
poſe, if at the ſame time the G or ) ſhall
be in d', C , or 4 of h , and he Pe
regrine.
b or 3 in the ſeventh or twelfth afflićting
the Lord of the Aſcendant, or the Q , the
Native is ſubjećt to have Scandals caſt upon

they ſhall rather do him good than harm.
The Lord of the Aſcendant or ) in Recep
tion with the Lord of the ſeventh, or in good
Configuration with him, the Native hath but
few Enemies.
When one of the Infortunes ſhall be in the
twelfth Houſe, the other in the ſixth, and the
Lord of the firſt in theeighth afflićted by them
both, the Native ſhall #. by the Conſpiracy
of Enemies. -
But the moſt general way I obſerve in my
Praćtice is this, that if the firſt Houſe or his
Lord, the ſecond and the Lord thereof, the
G) or 9 , or all of them are afflićted, Com
buſt, or in bad Houſes, the Native never wants
private Enemies, nor Troubles.
But if you would diſcover what the
quality of theſe Enemies are, then obſerve the
afflićting Planet or Planets, and judge from
thence; for if h be the afflićting Planet, then
they are Old men, Inferiour Perſons, Hus
bandmen, &c. if &, Souldiers, great Offi
cers in the Army, Chymiſts, and all workers
in the Fire, &c. then conſider the Houſe, for
if they are in the third, or are Lords of the
third, they are Brethren, Kindred, &c., if
the ſixth Houſe, Servants; if the ſeventh
the Wife or Perſons dealt with; if the tenth,
Men of great Fameand Authority, and ſuch as

Aſtly, I have reſerved this Diſcourſe of
L Death towind up the whole Judgmentof

here at laſt, becauſe there is nothing after
Death. " . . x
As in the Judgment of Life they obſerve
the Hylich, or giver of Life; ſo in Death, they
obſerve who is the 'Arattºrnº, Interječiar,

(169) -

r But Death is twofold, natural and violent;
the laſt of which I ſhallfirſt inſiſt upon, which
being throughly examined, the other will be
more eaſily underſtood.
1. The Luminaries in violent Signs of con
trary quality, whichare Y, 8, Šl, ut, 'W',:,
and part of f and ::, theſe are called violent,
becauſe the violent Stars have Dominion or
Exaltation in theſe Signs,— ſhew a violent
Death.
2. The G) and D, with violent Fixed Stars
within five degrees, threatens a violent Death,
— Such Stars are, Caput Algol, Aldebaran,Her
tu'ts, corm ; for whoſe Longitude and Lati
tude, you ſhall find a Table affixed at the end
of the Book.
Theſe two Rules have their effects only, and
chiefly confirmed when the Lord of the firſt
or eighthſhall be corporally joyned to one of
the Lights, or when one of the Lights ſhall,
have Rule in the firſt or eighth.

There may happen anativity when none of

Finally obſerve this general Exception, al
though two or three or more of theſe Apho
riſms ſhould take place in any Nativity; — .
nay, when many Teſtimonies ſhall appear in

(172)
If the Nature of the Sign and Planet do
agree, the thing ſignified is much increaſed 3
As fºr Example. 3 in fiery Sign ſhews Death
by Fire orfiery Inſtrument,without any Com
cation. - ---
Ifthe Nature of the Signs and Planets diſ
agree, and are different, the judgment muſt
be given according to the abounding Influx of
theSignificators mixed together; for itis not
f.to lay down Rules for all Nativities ;
utthe variety muſt be left to the Ingenuity
and diligence ofthe Artiſt. ,
But if no Arguments of a violent Death
offer themſelves, the Nativeſhall die a natural
Death; that is by a Diſeaſe, in his Bed; that
is, he ſhall live till Nature being either o
reſſed by a Diſeaſe, or extream old Age o
liging it, againſt which there is no defence,
Nature then having finiſhed its Courſe, the
Soul expires , and returns to the place from
whence it came, and all the A&tions and Paſ
fions of Nature ceaſe, but the Peripateticks
define Death thus, Mors ergo eſt omnium anime
funětionum ceſſatio , propter cºmpoſiti diſſolutio
mem. Magi, fol. 617. but the Hermeticks define
it better, thus, Quidem mors, nil hiſ Septra
Atio, Divulſie & Conſumptiofift iftius & Ra
dicalis vitae balſami tſ: , d quo ſolo anima cum
Corport colligatur & preſtat.
But there are ſome who interpoſe ſudden
Beath between a Natural and a violent one;
yet they are willing to acknowledge that it
comes near a violent Death, becauſe of the
ſudden and violent means by which Nature
expires
-
(173)
expires; whether it be by Suffocation, or
Apoplećtical Accidents, 7 Convulſions, Syn
copes, &c. or any other Natural violence
which parts the Soul and Body; I ſhall not
undertake to diſtinguiſh the kinds of Death
into ſuch curious terms; but only ſpeak to it
Aſtrologically, as indeed my buſineſs is at this
time; → And thereforebe pleaſed to conſider,
that a ſudden Death is but an unperfeót violent
one, as you may obſerve by conſidering the
the ūdand fourth Aphoriſms preceding per
haps the Q and ) might neither of them be
inviolent Signs, and yet perhaps both afflićted
by the Malevolents; ſo both the Lights ma
be afflićted by h or 3, or both, and yet .
therof theMalevolents is in a violent Sign,not
with violent Fixed Stars: So likewiſe ºr and
3 may be in d in the tenth Houſe, and yet
not in aviolent Sign, noryet afflićtingthe Lu
minaries; and yet when the M. c and Aſcen
dant comes by dire&ion, the one to the Body,
and the other to the ſquare of h or 3, the
Native ſo born, ſhall perhaps dye in Priſon, or
perhaps Mad, or elſe by being ſtarv'd : for
theſe Direétions to the M. c. always ruins a
Man's Reputation, and that is the way to be
ſtarv'd. Hence it may appear that ſudden
Deaths are indeed violent ones, and they
only differ in force of Killing; for Suffo.
cation, Self-Murther (I mean Hanging) and
publick Execution "in the ſame manner,
#. all be from the ſame Cauſe, and yet
differ in their Effeds, and that for the
Reaſons before-mentioned, my room is too

Of the Effeis of Direáions.
A Direétion is but a certain number of De
grees between one of the Hylegical
Points, and any Star or Aſpečt, which we for
diſtinétion ſake call the Promittor, and the
Hylegical Point, the Significators; for in the
Projećtion of future A&ions, four things are
uſeful, 1. Direáions. 2. Revolutions. , 3. Pro
feations. 4. Tranſits ; All which ſhall here
after be handled in their order, and firſt of
Direáions.
The Aſcendant direfiedto his Promittorf.
The Aſcendant or Horoſcope is dire&ted for
Life or Death, for the affečtions ofthe Body
and Journeys ; which if it come to the Bene.
ficks, it ſignifies good , if to the Maleficks
evil. — * -

ill placed.

and renders him unfit for Buſineſs; and this
is to be underſtood as well of his evil Aſpećts
falling in theſe Signs, as of his Body to be
direčted to ; the evil Aſpects of h or d in
any part of the Natives life are dangerous,

A Revolution: in Aſtrology, is no other,
thing but the Return of the O or any
other Planet to theſame place in which he was:
at the Birth; that is, in the ſame Sign, De
greeand Minute, and there are divers ways to
obtain it: Firſt, by Calculation, which of all
others is the beſt, if your Tables are true.
Secondly, by Redućtion from an Ephemerides.
And Thirdly, by a continual adding of five
Hours, 48 Minutes to any Revolution, truly
obtained, according to Argol's Revolutional
Table. - - ... --
The Figure of the Revolution being obtain

on, and is my next buſineſs.;
There are many Rules laiddown by Schonºr,
Origanus, Argol, Bonatus, and others in Latin,
and by my Honoured Friend Mr. Gadbury in

exped but little or no change in his life and . .
affairs; and that this particular of Revolu-- . .

ſider with theſe things, theſe Aphoriſms fol- ºl

dered, and doth wonderfully, ſhew the exačt
time of a Direétions Primordium ; and firſt
what a Profe&tion is.
Profečtion is nothing elſe but an Imaginary
motion of the Heavens, by the uſe of which,
we come to a more perfeót knowledge of the
inception of a Direétion, and other things;
the word is really Latin, and was I ſuppoſe
derived from the Greek’OJºurneia, a Jour
ney, from 'Ogºt the way, and weſpa to paſsa
and it is indeed but the progreſſion of the
M. c. Aſcendant, @., (, or GB to the ſame
degree of another Sign, ſo that there is thirty
degrees allowed equally for one years motion.
For Example. Suppoſe the 20 degrees of tº
ſhould aſcend at Birth, then 17 degrees ofII
will be on the M. c. and when the Mid
heaven (at the beginning of the ſecond year)
is 17 degrees of gº, then the Aſcendant is 20
degrees of 23, and ſo in the Sun, Moon, and
Part of Fortune, all of them making their
Profeótional remove in the ſame manner; and
in what Houſe ſoever you find any of the
Planets, in the ſame Houſe of Heaven they
ſtill remain, and only change their Sign year
ly to the ſame degree they poſſeſt at the
Radix. - . . .
And not only thefive Hylegicals, but alſo
the Cuſps of the Houſes, and the reſt of the
Planets are ſubjećt to this Profe&tional order ;
which being performed, and your Profestio
nal Figuré finiſhed, affords a Judgment as

There needs no long Direáors for Judg:

to obſerve the Promittor and his quality, and
in what quantity of time the Significator
comes to the Body of Aſpe&t of the Promlttor
by Direétion.
Profe&tional Dire&tions are thus performed ;
Subſtraćt the Sign, Degree, and Minute ofthe
Significator, from thoſe of the Promittor, and
what remains is the Arch of Direétion , which

I need not explain this Table, it is ſoeaſie
and familiar; for if youcannotfind your exadt
number of Degrees at the firſt entrance,enter
the ſecond time, and add thoſe numbers toge
ther, and you have your deſire, & fic de
Caeteris.
The Principal uſe I hitherto have made of
Profečtions, is firſt to obſerve the Harmony
of Nature; for if upon an ill Direáion there
ſhould happen an ill Revolution and Profe&ion,
that year doubtleſs, will be dangerous to the
Native, if not fatal. . . * -
.Secondly, to find out exa&ly when a Dire
&tion begins to work, whether it be good i.

evil; if it be for Sickneſs or Death, by taking
the diſtance of the Promittors Body of Ray,
from the @, D, or Aſcendant, or all of then,
if it ſohappen; but of the GB or ſecond Heue
tºº
Honour. . - *
Thirdly,to diſcover the Climaterical years,
for beſides the bare notion of Numbers , there
is ſomething to be ſaid for it in this Science;
eſpecially when the Aſcendant happens to be
giver oflife, and in Signs of equal or ſong Aſ
cenſion; for then at four years age the Horo
ſcope comes to the fourth Houſe, at ſeven to
the ſeventh Houſe, at eight to the Houſe of
IDeath ; ſo that when the Giver of Life comes
in a Profečtional Figure to any of theſe
ill Houſes, or to any good Houſe where there
happens to be a Conjun&ion of the Malig
nant Stars; this is the only true Climaðteri
eal year, and thence they ought to be reck
oned ; for I do not believe this (ſo long
approved). Magical myſtery of Numbers , it
carrying with it nothing ofviſible authority,as
the other does; and therefore I would humbly
requeſt all the Sonsof Art to conſider carefully
the Dočtrine laid down by the Antients: for
I think verily there is a great deal of truth not
in theſe only, but in the Alfridaries too,
which without doubt was the firſt ground for
our, Septenary Clima&ericals, and are ſtill
well worth our conſideration, and perhaps
better than ſome things we more eſteem and
embrace. -
And I am alſo of Opinion, that he who
hath h in p of 3, from the firſtand ſeventh,
will die in a Climaðterical year, and that a
of Eſtate, and the M. C. for .
(224)
Septenary too. But of theſe things e
nough. - . . . . . . .
The Aſcendant G) or ) , to the place
of the Body [...] or, 3 of 6 or 3, or h or
d’, to the Radical place of them, ſhews an
unhappy year.
The M. c. to the Radical place of 3% or Q,
or to their Benefick Rays, ſhews a plea
ſant, profitable, and honourable year to the
Native. - ->
When the Aſcendant, G) or, D., comes
to the fixth, eighth, or twelfth Houſes; it
ſhews an unhappy time, crazy and trou
bleſome.
when the M. c. comes to the place of .
the Dragon's Tale, it proves a year full of
Slander, loſs of Honour and Repute 5 and if
Th at the ſame time Tranſits the M. c. it
proves bad to the Fº And thus
much ſhall ſerve for the Dočtrine of Pro-,
fečtions,

C H A P. XXVII.
Of Tranſity.
Th; word Tranſit, is really Latin, from
Tyanſeo, and ſignifies as much as Mála
gaſya in the Greek , that is, to paſs by or
over; and indeed, a real Tranſit is only by
Body, and in effect hath moſt force and ener
gy ; but Artiſts uſe others, and ſo will I, di--
viding them into two ſorts; that is, ,
1. Corporeal."
2. Irradiant. .
... A Corporeal is, when any Planet paſſes by
the Radical placeof any of theSignificators,as
the Aſcendant, M. c. G), D, and GB; but if
the Malevolents h or of tranſit any of the
fore-mentioned Significators, and are at the
ſame time Stationary, it much increaſeth the
malignity of their effe&ts; ſo on the contrary, .
if x; or 2 tranſit thoſe places, and areſta
tionary, they increaſe the force of a Benevo-'.
ſent Direction or Aſpect, and mitigate the evil
of evil ones. -
An Irradiant Tranſit, is whén any Plahet -
paſſeth by the Rays of any other Star, by ºs
ii, A., &, or when any Planet caſtethany of :
thoſe Aſpećts tothe Cuſps of any of the Hou
fes, he is ſaid to tranſit that Houſe by that :
Aſpećthe then beholds it with ; but of allthe

---
(22 6)
ečts, the ºp is of moſt force in this parti
cu#., becauſe it caſteth its Rays direétly op
ofite.
p The Tranſits of the Planets are alſo of two
qualities, good and bad ; for the Body, k or
A of Žºor 2, are, good and Benefick 3 but
the D and 3’, are Thurtful and unkind; ſo
the 3¢ and A of h- and 3, are indifferent –,
good; but the Body, D or & are malignant
and hurtful...
# tranſiting the Radical Aſcendant, inclines.
the Native toMelancholy, Diſcontent; it gives.
the Head-ach, and a general ill habit of:
ºſtirs up Cholerick humours, and incites,
theNative to Quarrels, Contentions, and ſuch
likepaſſionateeffečts; the ſame is the effect of:
their D and 5°, but in a leſs degree, the like
may be ſaid of the § when it tranſits the .
Aſcendant; for that having no Ray, affords.

things being before conſidered) obſerve theſe
Rules following concerning the Moon. w

the Commencement of a Direčtion, and of the
fortunate and unfortunate days in the whole

damnable endeavours of thoſe, who make the
worldbelieve they can ſhew faces in a Glaſs ;
fetch People back, when they are run away;
cure Diſeaſes by Charmsand Lamens, and tell
a hundred pretty Lies of this kind, to make
their modeſt hearers believe they are Devils

MIX POR AN AXTP tº N:
O R T H E
PADA MFCuM continued;
upon the Dočtrine ofElections.
C H A P. I.
Of Election; , and firſt what an
- Eleåion is. . -
LECTIONS, as they were underſtood by
T, the Ancient Aſtrologers, were a certain
Obſervation of days and hours, whichby rea
ſon of every Man's Nativity (if it may or can
be known) and by reaſon of the motion of
the Heavens, &c., Times are either lucky or
unlucky, according as they agree or diſ
agree, with the Nativity of the Perſons who
deſires an Ele&tion to be ; and they are
called Eleótions from &Aéºw or &Aoyń,
Eleštio, a chufing or picking out, &c. and of
Eleåtions thereare two kinds... -
firſt,
º
(236)
Firſt, Univerſal.
Secondly, Particular.
. I call thoſe Univerſal Elečtions in the hand
ling of which, a particular Nativity is not
Concerned, nor required; as in the Founda
tº of Buildings, the LaunchingofShips, the
Felling of Timber, or Tilling of Land. T
And I call thoſe Particular, which have Rela
Hººto any one Man's Nativity, whom an E
lcáion may concern; as followeth,-
Letting of Blood, Entringupon anyoffice
Taking ofPhyſicé, or Dignity,
Theundertaking fany’Yriginning of journeys
£hyrurgical care, or Fmbaſſies,
Going into Baths, Beginning ofSta Voy
cutting offHair, &c,* 48.63,
Marriagii, . ..., \ Staling.ofDeeds.
For theſe kind ofa&ions and undertakings,
may Elečtions be made, ſeeing they are Natu
ral, and managed and º: by the
Courſe of Nature, and ſecond cauſes; and
therefore may be either furthered or hin
dred by the Poſitionor confideration ofthe
Stars, -orieanus. - - -
And the time to beobſerved in Ele&tions, is
twofold; firſt, in ſome it is fufficient to chuſe
theday only, in which the Moon isjoyned to
a Planet, who hath Rule of ſuch buſineſ; for
whichthe Elećtion is made, or in which the
ºrof the Buſineſs being placed in his Dig
nities, doth come toa fortunate Aſpečt of the
Benevolent Stars, - -
But
-
-
-
;
(237) w
But in other Ekötions, it is notſufficient to
know the day º but alſo the hour is to
be obſerved, and the Coeleſtial Figure muſt
be ſo ſet, that the proper Significators
may be fortunately placed inAngles,
And firſt,
C.H. A.P. II.
Of Univerſal Eletiionſ.
Irſt, in all Ekāions let the Angles be well
. Tº fortified, and the Significators well placed
in their Dignities, and let the Moon be as
ſtrong and fortunate as may be, and ſhe and
the Lord of the Horoſcope in a good Aſpe&t,
and both beholding the Aſcendant with ami
cable Rays; and to this purpoſe, Haly fol. 303.
tells us, that the Moon may be unfortunate
ten ſeveral ways; Prº WRENTREETCOmbuſ.
Secondly, when ſhe isin three Degrees of in,
her fall. Thirdly, when ſhe is in Oppoſition
to theSun. Fourthly, whenſheiscorporally
joyned to the Infortunes, or in D or dP to
them. Fifthly, when ſheiswithin 12 degrees
of the Head or Tail ofthe Dragon, ſhe being
then within the Limits of Eclipſes. Sixthl
when ſhe is in the laſt degrees of the Signs.
Seventhly, when ſhe is Cadent from#";Or
in the via combuffa; that is, the laſt half of
Libra, and the firſt half ofScorpio, and this,
ſaith he, isthe worſt of all Impediments, eſpe
cially in Marriages, and all matters of Wq.-
~ - men,
(238) -
men; in buying and ſelling, and in Journeys,
Eighthly, when ſhe is contrary to her Houſe,
or # not behold !. º: ; a good
Aſpe&t. Ninthly, when ſhe is ſlow in mo
*whitäääkiogerscall the motion of S4.
turn; that is, when ſhe moves 12 degrees or
leſs in 24 hours. And the tenth is that which
is called Void of courſe. -
Alſo let the Significator of the thing be
ſtrongand fortunate, but above all, the Aſ
cendant is the chief; let that be fortunated
with the preſence or good Rays of the Lights
or fortunate Stars, eſpecially if it be a thi
deſigned for duration; as Cities, Houſes ,
Ships, &c. in which caſes, let not H or dº
behold the Sun, Moon, or Aſcendant; but in
Sowing and Tilling of Land; the D in good
Aſpeãof h, and he ſtrong, is a Poſition be
fitting ſuch an undertaking; becauſe H, is the
Patron of Husbandry, and other ſuch like
things and perſonsas ſhall be hereafter ſpoken
ofin their proper places; ſo that the things
that I deſign to bring under this Judgment of
uniºralElečtions, are theſe following:

In the Conſideration of theſe Particulars,
take this Obſervation, that in Planting, Sow
ing, Grafting, Cuttingand Felling ofwood;
beſides
{
(239) -
º
}.
r
beſides the Figure and face of Heaven, you
muſt conſider the Univerſal times, the nature
of the Ground , the quality of the Seed, the
diſpoſition of the Graft, &c. afterwards con
ſider theſe things in this order following;
which for diſtinétion ſake I will divide into
Sečtions.
Sećt, 1. Of Sowing and Planting.
Times fitting for Planting and Sowing, are
taken from the motion of the Moon; which
ifſhe be in Y,95,"p,ºi,or VP (ſaith Leovitius)
ſhe is in places fit for Sowing, provided ſhe is . -
not unfortunated there; but if ſhe is placed
in Y or 8, ſhe is then fit for Planting only ;
alſo, if the Ground be moiſt, which is to be
Sqwed, or the Seed be of a moiſt Nature,
then it is fitteſt to Sow that Seed in the de
creaſe of the Moon; but for dry ground, and
dry hot, Seed, it is beſt, to Sow it in the in
creaſe of the Moon near the Full; and here.
it may be remembred, and hence obſerved,
if you pleaſe, that Peaſ, and Beans ſet or
Sowed upon, a new Moon, and ſhe in good
Aſpect of \, or Q, from aery or watery
Sigris, they never leave blooming till they be-,
gin to wither. . . . . . . . . . . in -
. But ſeeing that bhath a natural Significa
tion of Husbandry, Planting, Sowing, ºr, it
IS ; neceſſary to let the Moon be in a good
Aſpećt of Saturn, and he well placed in the
Figure , and let 8, 95, º, º, ø, or wº, be
in the Aſcendant,and 3 weak andin no Aſpett
either to the Moon ofHoroſcope. Sečt
€Ct. 2,
3
(240) I
- Scół. 2. ofoulingor Felling ofWoºd.
The common times for Felling of Timber
is known to all , and therefore I ſhall omit
that; but to fell Wood that it may wax dry i
and maſſy and be durable a long time, let the .
Moon be decreaſing between the Full and the
laſt Quarter, and let her be in good Aſpećt
with saturn , and if poſſible, let him be
frong and fortunate; for upon this depends
its duration.
Scćt. 3. Of Hunting,
For this Paſtime let the Moonbe in Y, &l,
or 7 in good: Aſpe&t of 3, let a Moveable
SignAſcend, and place the Moon in the tenth
Houſe in good Aſpeã of 3 or ?, let 2 be ..
in the ſeventh; and h fallingfrom an Ångle ||
no ways beholding the Aſcendant;-but if ||
you deſire to hunt Savage. Beaſts, as Wolfs,
Bears, &c. let not dº be in an Angle , and
... the Moon out of the fixth Houſe, free from all
Impediments ofthe Malignant Stars, neither
let a Quadrupedian Sign be in the Aſcendant;
and Haly gives this reaſon for it; for thenthe |
Hunters ſhall be killed, or be in danger by the
Beaſt they purſue. . . . - - - i

Scćt. 4. Of Fiſhing.
Fiſhing is moſt convenient when the Moon
isin 95 or 36, in the tenth Houſe, in >k or
A to Venus in the ſeventh, the D applying
and not ſeparating ; Let not the Moon be un
fortunated by h or eſ', neither let them be in
the Angles of the Figure, eſpecially the firſt
and ſeventh.
Sečt. 5. OfFowling. - -
Fowling is moſt pleaſant and ſucceſsful,when
the Moon is in ſome of the aery Signs, as II,
*, *z, applying to 3, and he and the Moon
in Reception, and both fortunately placed in
the Figure, to which you may add 2, if it
he poſſible, this makes the Fowler ſucceſsful
in his Paſtime; but if the Moon be unfortu
nate of f, or 3, he ſhall Catch nothing, that
he deſires. 3. º - 2
Sečt, 6. Of entring mpon Poſſeſſions.

of Horſ, or Foot-Races, &c.
Aſtrologically, and Experimentally han
dled from a worthy Friend and an
Excellent Artiſt.
º His Subjećt is to be conſidered two man
y ner of ways: Firſt, By way of Ele&ion.
Secondly, By Interrogation, or Queſtion.
In Eleåionſ ofthis kind,
'You are to obſerve this general Rule, i. e. to
‘put a Sign of the Superiour Planets upon the
Horoſcope, and let the Lord thereof and the
Moon be ſwift in Motion, and in good Aſpett
of each other from good Houſes of Heaven.
Secondly, you muſt carefully debilitate the
Lord of the ſeventhas much as maybe. 3.Let
, the Lordofthe hour, and Lord of the eleventh
# be the ſame, or elſe of the ſame Triplicity.
4: Let the Diſpoſitor of the Moon and the
Planet to whom ſhe applies be in their Digni
ties, or 1n laces of the Figure. 5. Let
Stars of a Benevolent and Commanding Na
ture be upon the Angles of your Figure, ac
cording to Ptolemy, Aph. 28. , 6, For Foot
Races,let a humane Sign Aſcend, or the Mº
-
*
* M 2
(244)
be in one. 7. For Horſe-Raceslet a Quadra
pedian, or Beſtial Sign aſcend,chiefly 7.8. Let
the Mid-heaven and Horoſcope be fortunate,
and the Lord of the eleventh Houſe aſſiſted
alſo, and a Benevolent Planet Lord of the
hour; for theſe are aſſured Arguments of Wi
&tory. 9 Let the Moon be in 2 or 2-, in
good Aſpect of Mars, Sol, fupiter, or Pinus;
and the framer of the Elećtion wins the Race.
Io. The Moon increaſing, and the Planet aſ
fiſting being inhis firſt or ſecond Station, and
in a Sign agreeable to his own Nature,is always
good. 11 The Lord of the ſeventh ſtrong,
and better fortified than the Lord ofthe Aſcen
dant, brings damage to the deſign. , 12. The
Moon ſlow in motion, and afflićted of h or
g, or in an ill part of Heaven, or in Azimen ||
or pitted degreesof a Sign, eſpecially in fixed
Signs; is very prejudicial. 13. The Lord of
the Aſcendant or twelfth Retrograde,or other
wiſe afflićted of h or 3 , the Rider and
Horſe both come to damage and hurt. 14.Let
neither the Moon or Lord of the Horoſcope be
Combuſt, Retrograde, in Fall, Detriment, or
in Cadent parts of the Figure; for all theſe
are very ill accidents to the Elečtion. 15. Let
the Lord of the twelfth in Horſe-Racesbe more
powerful and ſtrong than the Lord of the ''
fixth, which ſignifies the Horſe which is to
run againſt him, according to the aforeſaid
Rules. 16. In Foot-Races look to the Lord of
the eleventh Houſe, and weaken the Lord of
the fifth Houſe; for that is the hopes of him
you wager againſt. 17. In Foot-Races make
& your Friend, as much as may be, i.e. by
making him Lord of the eleventh, or Pºiº
lin

t
Him there, or clſe in the Horoſcope or tenth
Houſe, in good Aſpect of the Moon, or Lord
of the Aſcendant. 18. In Horſe-Races make
, 24 your Friend, and place him, as you were
taught of § before. 19. When the Planets
cannot be found in ſuch a poſture as to ſerve
you, according to any of the aforeſaid Rules,
make uſe of Fixed Stars of their Nature for
your purpoſe ; ſtill fortifying the Moon.
20. To avoid Treachery , let not the
Moon in your Ele&ion be in any ill Aſpe&t
of h, 3, or §, or they in any ill. Aſpe&t
one to another, or the Qy in the Aſcendant
or with the Moon; neither let 3, §, G),
or h, govern the hour in which the Race
is begun. -
And thus much for Ele&tions of this kind.
Of gueſtionſ belonging to the ſame.
In Queſtions, you have this difference from
Ele&ions; for in your Eleåtions you exerciſe
the freedom of your will, and if you take
good heed to your Rules, you appoint the
Iſſue of the Race as you would have it ; –-
But in §. you have no ſuch libºty,
the buſineſs being appointed before, and you
by them defire to be informed of the iſſue, .
whether good or evil, loſs or gain, by the
thing Interrogated.
For the clear underſtanding of which, you
are firſt to obſerve whether the Figure be Ra
dical, and fit to be judged or not ; and it is
then ſaid to be Radical when the Lord of the
Aſcendant, and the Lord of the hour are the
| M 3 fame,
(246)
ſame, or of the ſame Triplicity, or if the Aſ.
cendant and his Lord do well perſonate the
Querent, and that the Horoſcope is between
the fifth and twenty-fifth degree of any Sign,
or when the ſeventh Houſe is not afflićted; for
when the ſeventh Houſe is afflićted, the Artiſt
doth naturally commit Errors according to
the fourteenth Aphoriſm of Ptolomy, §.
quantiſ; Aſirolagus implicatur erroribus, cum
Septima domus & tius Dominis Imptdiantur 5.
becauſe the ſeventh Houſe doth ſignifie the
Artiſt. 2. Obſerve the Significator of the
Horſe ( which is the Lord of the twelfth al
ways) the Lord of theAſcendant and the D 3
for if they are free from. Impediment, and in
good places of the Figure ſwift in motion,
Öriental, or in their Eſſential Dignities, theſe
betoken the Querentſhall win. 3. If the Lord
of the ſeventh be in the Aſcendant, or Lord of
the eighth in the ſecond; the §erent will
gain by the Race. 4. If the @ be in the
tenth, eleventh, or ſecond in good Aſpett of
the Lord of the Aſcendant, it is good, chiefly
if ſhe is near eminent Fixed Stars, 3 ff.
the Lord of the Aſcendant is Superiouf to
the Lord of the ſeventh, and the iord of the
twezh Superiour to the Lord of the fixth,
and neither Retrograde hor Cadent, the
erent wins, 6. If the Moon transfers the
Light of the Lord of the ſeventh to the Lord
of the eleventh or Aſcendant, or to the Lord
of the hour, with other Teſtimonies; this is
very good. , 7. The Lord of the twelfth, and
the Moon in light and Maſculine degrees,
near 2, 3, 32, or dº the Querent's Horſe,
or the Horſe he lays on, gets, a famous Wi
- &ory,
(247)
&tory. 8. The Lord ofthe twelfth a Superiour
Planet , above the earth, in [] or ò’ to the
Lord of the ſixth or ſeventh, promiſeth Wi
&ory to the Querent, and threatens great
damage to the Queſted , and the beaſt he in
gag-th on. 9. The Lord of the Aſcendant
and twelfth , and the (, , and the Planet to
whom ſhe applies Angular, and the Lord of
the ſixth and ſeventh , and the Planet from
whom the D is ſeparated, is Cadent; ſhews
the Querent ſhall win. , 10. The Signific
tors of the Querent, and the Horſe he wa
gereth on , in commanding Signs, and the
Significators of the Quefited in Signs obey
ing ; are arguments of Vićtory. , 11. Many
Planets in the ſeventh Houſe, ſhew a Con
federacy in the Race, and Cautionary to the
Qūcrent. 12. The Lord ofthe Aſcendant and
Moon, and Lord of the twelfth and ſecond,
or their Houſes afflićted of h, d", or ‘U),ſhews
2 the Querent will certainly be cheated of his
Money; eſpecially if the Lord of the ſeventh
# be a Superiour, and the Moon give him virtue.
13. Obſerve the Planet afflićting, who if it be
the Lord of the eleventh , a Friend betrays
him; if Lord ofthe third,a Brother or Neigh
bour'; if Lord of the ſixth, a Servant, &c.
14. If the ſixth and ſeventh Houſes, and their
f Lords are aſſiſted; the Querent will certainly
! loſe his Money. 15. An Infortune in the
Horoſcope with the Q, and h, d", or o, .
Lords of the hour, is very evil for the Que
j, rent ; and therefore dehort him from going
on with his Wager. 16. The Lords of the
fifth, ſixth , and ſeventh in good Aſpećts
with the Benevolents and Reception alſo, and
- M.4. the
- (248)
the Lords of the eleventh, twelfth, and Aſcen
dant no way befriended , the Querent will
(according to natural cauſes ) moſt certainly
Joſe. 17. The Moon in [] or & to d", $, or
H, or in g with h or 3 ; it ſhews much
fraud is deſigned in the Race , and that they
do Confederate againſt the Querent. 18. As
you have been taught to judge of the Lord of
the Aſcendant and twelfth, &c. for Horſe
Races ; ſo judge of §, and the Lord of the
eleventh for foot Races. 19. An afflićted
Horoſcope or Mid-heaven, commonly cor
rupts the Queſtion, and renders it ſucceſ:-
leſs ; but if they are befriended and aſſiſted
with Benevolent Rays; the Queſtion hath a
proſperous iſſue. - -

fortunate in his own Houſe, may be allowed a

cauſe of his durability, Haly, in loco citato ;
but above all, let Mars be Cadent, and far re
mote from the Luminaries and Aſcendant and
the Lord thereof, and from the Lord of the
hour, and from the Lord of the terms aſcend
ing , likewiſe remove Mars from the GB, and
let not the Moon be with either ofher Nodes,
eſpecially the South Node ; but let her be aſ
cending in her Latitude, and that North; and
if poſſible, let her be in her Exaltation, or in
the Exaltation of YL, and as before is mcm
tioned of h : if you put him in good Aſpect
or Reception with Yi, he then ſignifies the
durability of the Houſe or City, the peace, qui

It isgenerally obſerved in Nativities, that:
the Moon in 3 of the G), and [] of H, ſhews
that ſuch a Nativity is not Vital; and indeed.
ſo it hath proved in the fate of this Fabrick.
It may be obſerved, that this Figure nearly
agreeth with the Nativity of thatgreat Prince,
whoſe hand gave a beginning toitsbeing, and
doubtleſs it was by him premeditated ; for he
had the ſame Figure almoſt at the laying of
the Foundation of the New Exchange in the
Strand, which was done a Month before this,
and the Moon then in Scorpio alſo ; butin that
Figure, although the Moon was in 3’ of l ;
yet they both caſt their good Rays to the Ho

(251)
and 2 in Reception with Mercury; Lörd of
the tenth and firſt , which indeed was a great
deal the more advantagious Figure for glory:
and duration, although there are ſome ill acci
dents in that Figure, as well asthis 3-But
to ſpeak of this Figure in particular, obſerve,
* Lord of the Aſcendant is in 8 almoſt Pere
grine, (he having nothing there, but the leaſt
of all Dignities). Cadent, and in [] of h in
the ſixth, and he and \l the ſtrongeſt Planets
in the Figure, the one Lord ofthe ſixth, and
the other of the eighth Houſe , and 2 Lord of
the Horoſcope is going to Combuſtion in the
tenth, and the Sun,who is fons vite is afflićted
by 3%.Lord of the eighth Houſe; and YL who
is in part Lord of the fourth Houſe, which .
ſignifies theend of a thing, is Combuſt, (oras
ſome will have it, in Cazimi) and the Moon
in the fourth is afflicted alſo by the [] of Hº ;
hence it may beconcluded, that the Reaſonsof
its Ruine was from its º: and that
Buildings as well as Bodies,havetheir Apheta's, .
Alchocoden's,and Anareta's.
I ſhall not ſtand to innumerate the Rules
before-mentioned, and how they take place in
the Ruine of this Fabrick; but leave them to ,
the Reader, to ruminate upon, and to ſharpen
the edge of his fancy in the applying of them
to the preſent purpoſe, and ſo proceed tothe
next Example, which is of the Royal Exchange
in London, whoſe Foundation-Stone was laid
by our preſent Soveraign King charles the Se
cond (whom God preſerve) it having been
burnt by that dreadful Fire 1666. and now to .
be Rebuilt in 1667. Ottob. 23. at Noon, the
Figure followeth. - .
Its
(253)
while the City is in being ; for here is H.
Lord of the Horoſcope, in V*. his greateſt
Dignities, and placed in it (accordingto the
forementioned Rule of Haly, fol. 309.) in A
to the D, and ſhe in 8, her Dignities, caſt
ing her good Rays to the Horoſcope; next,
here isthe O and 3 in the tenth Houſe, and
both within Orbs of the Conjunction of 2,
and Mercury in Reception with & , Lord of
the tenth Houſe, and the GB in the ſeventh
Houſe in the Dignities of ¥ and the D, and
3. and the D ſtrong, caſting their good Rays
ither. -
Thus you ſee, here are all, the advantagious
Poſitions mentioned by Haly; for here F.
Lord of the Horoſcope and Figure, alſo in A.
ofthe D, and Q Lady of the hour upon the
Cuſp of the tenth, caſting her A to the Horo
ſcope alſo ; and g who is in 6 with the Sun,
in the tenth Houſe, is in Reception with 3
Lord of the tenth , and the tenth and fourth
Houſe are Fixed Signs, and the Horoſcope by
the preſence of Saturn-, is cqual to a Fixed
Sign alſo.— ... º.
Here is one thing to be obſerved in the
Building of this ſtately pile; for h Lord of
the Hour is in [], to \l , and in 3’ to the
GB ; ſo it ſhews ſame trouble, hinderance or
impediment in its Building ; and as 24 is a
general Significator of Wealth and Money ;
ſo it ſhould ariſe from ſomething fignified by
fupiter; and the rather becauſe he is Lord of
the ſecond, which ſignifies the ſubſtance of the
Place, or Money ; the truth is , as Iºny ſelf
ſaw, (the Building being half finiſhed ) the
Sheriff of the City came to ſeize all upon the
. . Premiſſes 3.

Premiſes; but the owners having a timely . . )
warning ſhut up the Gates, and denied them
entrance, and ſuddenly after made up the dif

ingdid again go on ; yet thiswas ahinderance
and diſparagement, and did a little impede
their work ; and this, as I remember, did
happen, according to the diſtance of Ł from .
the [] of TL.
The next Experiment that I ſhall preſent

Whoſoever ſhall examin this Figure, will
have no cauſe to admire that this Ship had no
longer a Being in the world ; for here is g
who is Lord of the Horoſcope, is Combuſt in
the eighth Houſe, in Y a violent Sign , and
Mars who is in the Horoſcope, is in ſm. to the
Moon in theninth , and ſhe according to her
Longitude is near violent Fixed Stars ; he is
alſo in dº to Y, in the ſeventh, hebeing Lord
of the ſeventh and fourth Houſes; Saturn alſo
is in D to the Sun in the eighth Houſe, and
the Sun is afflićted by the preſence of Venus,
who hath Dignities in the eighth Houſe.
alſo.
Hence ſhould we examin this Figure by .
the Method and Rules of Nativities, there was
no probability of its long duration, becauſe
the Lord of the eighth is a Malevolent, and
in the Aſcendant, andthe Sun who is giver of
Life, is in the eighth affiićted by h, who is
Lord of the fixth ; and indeed all the Signifi
carors areafflićted either in the eighth, or b
**
the Lord of the eighth ; the effe& of whic
to that Rule before given , fol. 82.
which you ſee, is the ſame in effect here, as
in the Nativity of a Child, they both being
doom'd to the fate of Oblivion, and that in
their Infancy too; and thus you ſee what the
Sun in the eighth in a fiery Sign, and º Lord
of the Aſcendant Combuſt there alſo, and the
D in tº to 3 in theHoroſcope, can do in a
Ship's Nativity; but if we may examine what
Direáions were the cauſe of this.Accident, it
may have ſome power to prevail with thoſe,
who are willing to diſcern and ſeparate truth
from falſhood; therefore if we ſhould *:

but a miſtake of 15 minutes in time, and
make the Horoſcope i8 degrees, odd minutes;
the Aſcendant at this time came by Direétion

Of Particular Electionſ.
N ſuch things as belong to particular Ele
&tions and Perſons, let this Rule be diſi-.
gently obſerved , that the Ele&tion may be.
cffećtual for the purpoſe deſigned, and to this.
end, you muſt obſerve the Figure of the Na
tivity; for indeed theſe Elcáions of them
ſelves without regard to the Nativity , are.
fruitleſs and Ineffectual; For example, if a
man would eleēt a time to take Phyſick, the
uſual time is when the D is ings, or 343 but
if h or 3 were there, or oppoſite to it , in
that man's Nativity, inſtead of his Phyſick
working kindly, perhaps it may kill him, or
what is leaſt , ; do great prejudice to his
health. –– So if a man would make an Ele
{tion for Marriage, and place Q. very well in,
her Dignitics, and in D, in good Aſpºt of his
. - - yet -
\
**.
:
º
:
(257)
yet if they were unfortunate places in the Ra
dix where x and Q are placed, the Election
will be without effect, -again, he will not
only err in not placing his Stars in good pla
ces of the Heavens ; but alſo in expećting a
good effe&t from a good Ele&tion, when per
haps the Nativity threatens him with the con
trary, (as perhaps in Marriage with a bad
wife) and alſo in expe&ting thoſe things he
deſires,before Nature isripe to produce them ;
for he orſhe who hath h in the ſeventh, or in
ill Aſpe&t of the Moon or Q, and two of the
Significators in Barren Signs, eſpecially the
Moon and 2, that Man very rarely Marries
before thirty ; which if he doth, he muſt
have ſome extraordinary Marrying Direáions
to perform it; and ſo in Health, Sickneſs,
Honour, &c. the Direétions muſt be conſ:-
dered; for if the decreed time is not come, it
will profit nothing to make a happy Elečtion,
and indeed theſe things ought to be confi
dered as the foundation and ground of Ele
&tions. . . . . -
And ſo I come to ſpeak in particular to eve
ry diſtinët part, each of which I ſhall diſtin
guiſh by a Sečtion, -- -
Sečt. I. Of Elwº-lating.
. This is fit to be confidered by all that are
obliged to uſe Phlebotomy; in which lettheſe
Rules be conſidered. -
Firſt, The Age and Complexion of the Per
ſon, the weather, time of the year, &c. unleſs
you are compelled to let Blood ; *:
(258)
ſuch caſes, the wife and Judicious Phyficians
have more reſpe&t for neceſſity than for Ele
&tions; becauſe delays are dangerous.
Secondly, TheConfiguration ofthe Sun and
Moon, the Moon increaſing in Light is moſt
convenient for young Men; but for old Men,
or ſuch as are well grown in years, it is beſt
to have the D decreaſing.
Thirdly, The Sign the Moon poſſeſſeth, and .
what Rays ſhe caſteth to the good or the evil
"Stars; and alſo let no Artiſt uſe any Inſtru
ment upon Man's Body for Inciſion, the Moon
being in the Sign governing the Part which is
to be Cut, Lanced, or opcned; for the Moon
affords that Member a greater quantity of
Humours, and what danger any Member is in,
when a current of Humours runs to it being di
ftempered, every Chyrurgeon knows ; what
Signs govern the Parts of the Body, hath been
already ſhewed,
Fourthly, Let the D be free from Impedi
ment by the Malignant Stars, and let her be
in good Aſpeat with Y, and $2, for this doth
much profit, yea, without the Nativity; but
if the Nativity may be had, kt not the G be
upon the Radical places of h or d, neither
let either oftheſe be in the Horoſcope, neither
let the Horoſcope be the Sign of the fixth,
cighth, or twelfth in the Radix, nor where
h, d, or ºy was , , and if poſſible , not any
Sign upon which they ſpread their Malignant
Rays.
ūb, Let the Lord of the Aſcendant at
the time of Blood-letting, be in the fourth
with the Moon , or Configurated with the
Lord of the eighth Houſe; let the Malevolents
fall
(259)
-
fall from Angles, and let not theſeventh Houſe
_be unfortunate; for that ſignifies the Chy
rurgeon.
Scćt. 2. Of Pillº, Potions, &c. and
other Phyſick.
Firſt, Let the general times be conſidered,
when it is moſt convenient to take Phyſick ;
for in Spring time our Bodies are more eaſily
Purged, than in Summer or Winter: Again,
Purgations are more Nauſeous and Dangerous
in the Canicular days, as Riverius, and others
have ſufficiently proved ; and ſo they are in
other very hot or cold days.
Secondly, You muſt obſerve the D ; for if
ſhe be decreaſing in Light, and not afflićted
by the evil Rays of the Malevolents; or if ſhe
be in g with a Retrograde Planet , not near
the Sun, it is a very good time to Purge the
Humours.
Thirdly, Let the D be in SS, ſit, or X ,
theſe being moſt fit to Purge Malignant Phleg
matick Humours; but to Purge Melancholy,
let the D be in II, º,or 2: ; to Purge Chol
ler, place the D in ſig, and ſome ſay 8 ; but
I think that is more fit for Vomiting ; ſome
there are who Purge all Humours, the D, in:
SS, in, or 36.-Thus,
Scorpio or Piſces, $9. Purge Choler.
The 6 in cancer :3. Purge Melancholy.
in >k or 4X to > 0 s:Purge Phlegm.
Yet
(260)
ºf
Yet I cannot be of the opinion that the Di
in of with YL, is fit to Purge any Humour,
the Phyſick being at that time almoſt digeſted
into Aliment, and doth not work like Phyſick,
eſpecially in carrying off Humours. ...
Then let the Configurations of the other
Planets with the Moon be conſidered ; for the
Moon in ill Aſpećt of h or 3 , gives Phyſick
an evil Conſequence, & in good Aſpećt with
the Q and Y, doth further the kindly work
ing of Phyſick. If you are to take or give a
Vomit, let it be when the Moon is in a rumi
nating Sign, and ſuch are Y, &, Su, VP; but
if it be a Purge, let the D be any where elſe,
but there,the former Rule's confidered ; Like
wiſe, for Purging, let the D be joyned to a
Planet under the earth ; for by that means
the humours will paſs the eaſier downwards,
and the Stomach beleſs ſubjećt to Vomit.
Sect 3. Eletions for Bathing.
Baths are uſed either to Mundifie the Body.
from uncleanneſs, or to reſtore decayed health
and ſtrength; ſuch as belong to the former are
good when Phlebotomy is ſo; namely, when
the Moon is in tº or 36, indſ or friendly A
