welcome everyone I&#39;m Dr Stephen Greer
I&#39;m the founder of the disclosure
project I&#39;m an emergency doctor retired
now emergency medicine and Trauma
I have been working in this area for
about 33 years as a volunteer and as a
provider information to people in the
United States government
if you&#39;re seeing behind me a moment ago
this event 22 years ago on May 9 2001 at
that event there were 22 folks who came
forward
and that information is all on our
website and on YouTube and those were
folks who actually some of them who
handled extraterrestrial
bodies called evens extraterrestrial
biological entities handle craft
we&#39;re on retrieval teams all kinds of
witnesses now that got a certain amount
of attention in Congress but they
weren&#39;t ready at that time to do
hearings which they&#39;re preparing for
um I understand from people in the house
government reform and oversight
committee and so over the last 16 months
I&#39;ve been asked to provide as much
intelligence as I can to folks who have
been working to get to the bottom of
this since the Congress passed a law
requiring the Director of National
Intelligence to come forward with
information to the extent that he had it
now one of the problems with that
process
is that and I discovered this in 1993 in
December 13th of that year when I
briefed the director of the CIA at the
time R James Woolsey for then President
Clinton
he and the president had been waived off
and not given information on this
subject that&#39;s when as a young doctor I
realized that this was for being run
outside appropriate oversight and
supervision by the Office of the
President and the Congress and that is
just a fact so at that point of course
it sort of upended my life in many ways
but we began to try to get information
to the executive branch further do
research provide whistleblower testimony
but it was all done very quietly I then
started providing information to folks
in the Congress such as representative
Dan Burton who was chairman of the
government house reform and oversight
committee Senator Dick Bryan of Nevada
ironically home of Area 51 on the Senate
intelligence committee and many others
those proceedings went forward as a
volunteer effort and all of this is
still a volunteer effort we are unfunded
volunteers and I do want to thank every
one of the people people here made this
happen all these military whistleblowers
coming forward and our staff and most of
my wife Emily I will tell you if if my
wife Emily hadn&#39;t been a rock we
wouldn&#39;t be here she&#39;s amazing so
um
foreign
we got married 44 years ago in August
this coming August so we have four kids
12 grandkids so ironically
the the my grandkids are the ages of my
daughters when I started this process
so it&#39;s
beautiful but like really why is this
taking so long so in my young years I
thought okay the
we&#39;ll get this information to the
president and key people in the Congress
I&#39;ll go back to my normal life taking
care of shootings and savings and what
have you and off we go well that didn&#39;t
happen as you all know or you would have
known and I think the media has played a
very key role recently in covering this
uh and or whistleblowers beginning to
come out in other settings besides this
and I applaud them and I think more
should do so
uh now the history of this
is important because if you look at the
testimony we have already
it&#39;s something like 70 to 80 people that
we have debriefed videotaped have their
transcripts and it&#39;s available to the
media and the public through our website
and our YouTube channel we&#39;ve very
transparently put out everything we can
uh but to the extent
a not-for-profit uh entity can do it
with Volunteers in no office and new
staff so I don&#39;t want people to not get
too Grand here this has been a volunteer
effort for 33 years and those people are
heroes as are these men up on the stage
with me today
now
foreign
just a quick trip through some of the
previous Witnesses we had Sergeant
Clifford Stone he was on an NBC team
nuclear biological chemical back in the
60s was actively involved in retrieving
extraterrestrial vehicle embodies what
have you they were called evens
extraterrestrial biological entities we
have his testimonies there for anyone to
see we have people like John Callahan
who is the top accident investigator at
the FAA when the Japan Airlines event
happened uh in in the 1980s during the
Reagan years and they tried to cover it
up he took the original FAA tracking
tapes the disclosure project have the
originals and you&#39;re welcome to see them
those of you in the media we can try to
get those to you so all of these sort of
testimonies and Witnesses have come
forward already but now we&#39;re at the
stage where there&#39;s real utility because
the official law now is that the
government has mandated the Pentagon the
intelligence Community to research this
and report back to Congress
now this problem we&#39;ll get into a moment
with that whole process which is
important that you understand and
particularly the media understand but
first I want to tell you what we&#39;ve
handed off this week to the Congress and
to the White House and to the Pentagon
Aero office the aaro office is tasked
with investigating this so we can go
through the list of the material in the
archive it has government documents in
the tens of thousands from the all those
countries United States Canada Australia
Russia
Soviet Union United Kingdom and others
we have 145 top secret facilities some
of which are black sites that are named
and on a map and you&#39;ll see them in a
moment the supporting documentation of
it are in the archive meaning the
witnesses testimony who they were when
they were there where the locations is
sometimes up to where the gate is and
that&#39;s been handed over to the United
States government this week
there are
752 and Counting whistleblowers who come
forward over the years some of them are
now deceased but what&#39;s important even
the ones who are deceased if you go to
their history and their command and what
they provided there is an investigative
thread to follow back in very important
there are also files with all these
witness testimonies that have been
provided up to date in the archive or
121 we learned of another one last night
from a very high level whistleblower who
is not ready to come forward so there&#39;s
actually 122 crash retrieval cases of
these uaps and those are documented uh
Michael schrat who is an aerospace
historian and is working full-time with
us beginning in November had worked for
Lockheed but not the Skunk Works on
conventional operations and he is doing
those investigations for us and also the
beautiful
illustrations of what these Witnesses
have had to share and you will see those
then we also have
the documents that include Clues names
of Witnesses in other words government
documents that are not Declassified that
we have now we&#39;ll get into this in a
minute and there are many uh so-called
deep throws who provide Intel on the
background who are working with us some
of whom are very senior in these
operations others are people who have
just incidentally been involved
okay next
so this is just a thumb
pictures of all these guys that we
already have come forward they&#39;re there
for you to see they run from NASA folks
and all that it&#39;s in the YouTube channel
it&#39;s in the archive those were done uh
all these were up to
2001. so we&#39;re talking a long time ago
but those exists it&#39;s perhaps a tree
that fill in the woods a lot of you
didn&#39;t know about next
and I want to go through this very
quickly this is just a scrolling list of
the the witness list each one of these
Witnesses has a file where they have
either been interviewed or provide
intelligence and corresponded with me
and that I have debriefed personally
over the last 30 years so you&#39;re going
to see this goes on for about a hundred
named persons and then it becomes a
Black List it just has to be blacked out
why I&#39;m not holding anything back except
what I&#39;ve been requested to by people
whose confidence I have told them I will
keep so I&#39;m a medical doctor we
understand patient
yo doctor confidentiality like an
attorney understands that but until
these guys want to be unmasked and come
forward we will not disclose their names
except
either redacted list is something
available to the media and to the public
now
in addition to that it&#39;s very important
the unredacted list and the full files
including all my correspondence files
are in the unredacted archive it&#39;s about
let&#39;s see uh
isn&#39;t it cool that you can put it&#39;s
terabytes on something like this
this is all it is but it&#39;s about
terabyte we have about eight terabytes
of information we&#39;re in the process of
scanning it and trying to put it into a
searchable database this has been
provided to the intelligence Community
as I mentioned Pentagon Congress and the
White House
it is also the redacted version would be
available to the media if you can help
us fit in a hard drive we&#39;re really not
funded properly in each of these costs
several hundred dollars so we gave it a
thousand of them it&#39;s more than we&#39;ve
ever had but nevertheless it is an open
archive eventually we want to have it on
an Internet site but the names that
you&#39;re seeing now you&#39;re going to see
all their information is blacked out and
it&#39;s because they&#39;ve asked not to be
named now they can be known by people
who are working in a skiff
and have a vault and who have the
ability to then pursue it in the
interest of National Security that has
been provided to these key offices
so I just wanted to give you that as
sort of an overview of how the list was
constructed It Is by no means complete
we have a new whistleblower coming
forward every week or two now at this
point and uh Michael Stratford nodding
his head yeah this has become a torrent
and so we want to set up a mechanism
we&#39;re recommending that you&#39;ll hear what
our recommendations are for the
president and Congress to resolve this
crisis next
so I wanted to mention
that these bases if you look at them
let&#39;s go to this is where all these
illegal operations have happened I&#39;m
saying illegal because we can prove that
this information as Senator annually
said you&#39;ll hear his statement in a
moment
has been run by a very shadowy
deep black operation and we&#39;re not
talking to legal black budget of the
United States we&#39;re talking about
projects that presidents and CI
directors and secretaries of defense
members of the Congress who have a need
to know and are clear tssci and Skiffs
secure compartment information
facilities have been blatantly either
gas lit denied access that is the
foundation of everything we&#39;ve done is
that these projects are a priori illegal
and therefore unconstitutional and have
to be reined in because not doing so is
a threat to the National Security
so here is your list
I&#39;m not going to go through 145 sites
some of them are black sites some of
them are bases you know about like
Wright-Patterson Edwards Nellis Area 51
so-called but all of them are based on
witness testimony and intelligence we&#39;ve
gathered over the last 30 years and it&#39;s
time for it to be disclosed and so now
you have it next
here&#39;s one and people go just go out in
Mojave Desert Michael schret took this
picture when it was okay to fly near it
and across small private plane it is the
site for the Lockheed range underground
entrance
what&#39;s in there well there are man-made
and this is the big story no one&#39;s
telling you
a large number of the uaps are in fact
deep black budget electrical Vedic
electromagnetic field propulsion devices
based on the study of extraterrestrial
vehicles that began in the 1940s that is
a fact we can prove it so when you see
these sort of places just remember many
of them
I want to be careful what I&#39;m saying
here someone who is in charge of the
black budget in the United States in
2022
and went out to the Lockheed Skunk Works
based on some information he had he was
shown a bunch of old jet aircraft he
knew he was being gaslit and they
reached out to me and I said what do you
want I&#39;ll give you everything we have
and that&#39;s what&#39;s happened over the last
16 months so I cannot name this person
but they&#39;re a wonderful person of
enormous integrity and hero of our
country
so I want to just go through quickly
some of the new ones who aren&#39;t here now
the reason these have initials they&#39;re
waiting to be cleared for a coming
forward publicly they&#39;re afraid and let
me explain to you why they are this man
here&#39;s just his incoming letter we get
these every day now uh he&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll
lose his pension he signed an 80-year
non-disclosure agreement he has been
threatened and some of these have
seriously had their lives threatened
it&#39;s a very thuggish situation going on
that the Department of Justice and FBI
need to drill down on very quickly next
here&#39;s an illustration of one event that
he was involved in back when there was a
extraterrestrial vehicle that crashed
and then ultimately ended up at Lawton
Oklahoma near Fort Sill this man has
been in a skiff with these objects these
illustrations are based on his direct
testimony and hours of discussions since
2016. here is a small extraterrestrial
body about 39 inches long that was
retrieved in that operation there are
extraterrestrials of various sizes the
last known count I had of different
civilizations involved with this about
60 to 70 in that range and I think there
could be more next
this is one of the underground command
centers that he was assigned to in the
from the Pentagon uh he was with
technical management office and then
some other offices and investigated some
criminal activities that occurred with a
three-star General uh related to this
subject that the Department of Justice
was basically unable to prosecute
because they were denied access to the
operations next
and here&#39;s one that was also in this
another facility as an extraterrestrial
vehicle he actually was there very close
to it this gentleman wants to come
forward he needs to be protected and
this is why we&#39;re calling for explicit
witness protection and explicit pension
and asset protection for these
whistleblowers next
and this is just an indication of a type
of electromagnetic system that actually
can cloak any tank or any object that
we&#39;ve developed over the years and he
was read into this as well next
so there&#39;s another gentleman I&#39;m going
to run through these very quickly we&#39;d
be here for 30 hours if I didn&#39;t I&#39;m
just giving you a tip of the iceberg
right
this is a guy who was at The dugway
Proving Grounds very key facility Ms we
call him he was a work for C Martin
Corporation contractor and he was in a
facility that had an extraterrestrial
vehicle that had was being studied by
scientists he noticed a chief scientists
involved he has named that individual to
us and they can all be subpoenaed now so
this object was there in 2009 he didn&#39;t
know the date of acquisition but he
thought it was fairly recent
next he also was read into and had the
chief scientist show him the location
which we now have of a dumb deep
underground military base that is in the
dugway sector so-called Avery sector AV
ery and it has huge capacity for parking
you go in and it was a vast underground
complex in that location that location
has been handed off to investigators
with the U.S government next
this gives an illustration of the size
of this you could put easily on the
platform that goes down the Air Force
One it&#39;s a very large elevator goes down
Underground
connects
and then we have this gentleman he was
not long ago in the Nellis range in the
Nevada Test Site north of of Nellis Air
Force Base and he next slide was on a
retrieval team now let me explain how
this guy got involved he was on a
recruited out of Fort Campbell to be
somebody to be on a retrieval team with
a top secret clearance to pick up when
we have an accident with a Hilo
helicopter or jet because there&#39;s
classified technology on those often and
this our YouTube pilot here will explain
that perhaps but the point is he went
from there and that was Preparatory to
being on a retrieval team for this so he
was involved with this operation it was
a man-made a so-called alien
reproduction vehicle is called by some
people or at a lot of people just call
them Advanced Technologies of the
euphemism but it&#39;s based on studying the
electrobovitics and magnetic field
propulsion system items of the
interstellar vehicles that involve the
science of quantum entanglement and you
know going you know basically you want
to go from one point in space and to
another say this is one point this is
another
you&#39;re not going through a straight line
you&#39;re folding space-time that&#39;s how
you&#39;re doing
we&#39;re not going to do a physics lesson
here you know had enough of that in
pre-med but anyway so this is an object
and I&#39;m not a physicist we have a
physicist here uh but this object was
retrieved because it became disabled
some of these retrieval operations are
not extraterrestrial but they would like
sometimes the public to think maybe it
was because the bigger secret I&#39;ll tell
you right now is not the
Extraterrestrial issue it&#39;s these
Technologies which an unsupervised and
frankly illegal operation have which is
a threat to the National Security
period
this we will prove and this is a bigger
threat the existence of these in the
hands of unsupervised operations
that have escaped the oversight of the
president the Office of the President
and the Congress for since
1956 to 1960. hence Eisenhower&#39;s speech
beware the military industrial complex
this is actually what he was talking
about I know people who have since
passed away like our witness Stephen
lovekin who was the White House with
Eisenhower who said Point Blank the
president lost control of these projects
and that he was very upset and angry
about it but these projects became so
compartmentalized that he no longer
could control them so this is one you
can see there are rivets and what have
you uh and it will go through this later
after our fine gentleman and
whistleblower speak but I want to give
you this overview really quickly next
so this is actually an extraterrestrial
vehicle very large one that was at the
Nellis North range we have the location
of the Hilo pad it&#39;s Delta Force manned
this occurred back in that same era
around 2009 about 65 feet across is
seamless but it has sort of a clamshell
part of it there was a
a ramp that wrote out like he said like
a fruit a roll up that came out of it
and there was a a r a RV above it that
was headed in lock it was an
electromagnetic lock on this object I
think it was stunned and that&#39;s how it&#39;s
brought down
this is not infrequent uh not every day
but not infrequent I said over the last
80 years at least
122 have come down so there are
helicopters he was on the team to pick
up debris this one was of course intact
it began to pulse and operate and came
back to life as it were and uh the
entire uh group that was there
basically we&#39;re putting some kind of a
stasis electromagnetically
sounds like science fiction teleported
back to the Hilo pad
instantly but before that happened he
had this meeting with two of these
extraterrestrial biological entities a
male and a female and this is a very
accurate according to the Whistleblower
who needs to come forward when there&#39;s
adult protection they had no apenna the
ears are outside
and had no hair and there was a male and
a female and it was made very clear to
him by these beings that they were
completely non-hostile all
extraterrestrial civilizations are
non-hostile if they were hostile the
Technologies they have would have
been made quite clear to us in August of
1945. we&#39;ll get to this in a moment
so this later he had an event when he
tried to leave that command where there
was a fake what&#39;s called a program life
form alien these have been used and what
you hear in the fabled lore of
abductions and stuff in the UFO lore
this is actually a man-made creature but
it&#39;s not living per se it has a covering
the skin like
it tried to take him with the one of
these arvs in command and some people
camouflaged in the ground near his truck
after he got out of this command he was
disgusted with what was happening he no
longer going to be part of that project
but they weren&#39;t happy he left I told
him it&#39;s a miracle that you live to tell
this Tale
and so what happened is that his pickup
truck went into sort of complete lock
motor died because of this man-made UFO
UAP he opened the door because he saw
this creature which he thought was an
alien it&#39;s not and he hit it it fell he
kicked it and it split open this outer
and he saw the
integrated circuits and fiber optics and
what have you this man I&#39;ve dealt with
quite a bit he was ready to come to the
Arrow skiff he had a nasty encounter
with people who threatened him directly
this is recent uh and so we have not
been able to bring him to the Aero
Pentagon briefing next
and this is one that came in
2009 we had a witness SL we call him
Coast Guard and he was this is his
incoming letter to me the redacted
information and then he told us about an
event off of Guam where his Coast Guard
ship which is a buoy servicing vehicle
out there was caught in on a mutual
assist and he got there and you&#39;ll see
known the next picture there was an
extraterrestrial vehicle that we had
downed but got lost in the Deep Waters
there in the Marianas Trench and uh they
had gotten caught and Tangled Up and
oddly a fisherman net from Japan a
trawler big one big trawler and so they
were called in to retrieve this he went
and did retrieve it he was part of the
crew that most of them went
down quarters but with blacked out
windows he was there above crew above
ground took a very sharp object to try
to scratch it and penetrable could not
scratch it could not penetrate it these
are very Advanced Metallurgy Nano
molecular material Interstellar Vehicles
next
so
what&#39;s going on with this all of you
have seen over the last four or five
years these uh footage the footage come
out in the pentagon&#39;s confirmed are
three-dimensional objects with sensors
and what have you
the so-called Tic Tac and others now
I&#39;ve spoken to one of the pilots who
chased these objects you&#39;ve seen it on
CNN 60 Minutes all these places what
hasn&#39;t been told when this event
happened over the or in the early 2000s
is that these objects which you&#39;ll see
in a moment
particularly one of them we have
matching top secret witness testimony of
them being a man-made object that our
jet pilots and Military don&#39;t know
exists this is dangerous in terms of
deconflicting operations so let&#39;s go to
the next and play this
yeah
this is a [ __ ] drone bro
there&#39;s a whole Fleet of them look on
the essay
oh my gosh
they&#39;re all going against the wind the
wind&#39;s 100 point out west okay dude
that&#39;s not our LNS though is it
well if there&#39;s a good thing
it&#39;s rotated
this is the so-called Tic Tac now
one thing
now
of course this has been called an
unknown uh UAP what have you uh we can
excuse the Pentagon and most of the
military
and the White House and the Congress for
not knowing what this is because the
operations that have been building these
are deep black illegal and they are not
disclosing it properly to the
authorities in our constitutional
democracy and Republic this is based on
a sighting of a group of people is
basically the same object uh in the
1960s 1967 let&#39;s go to the next slide
and it&#39;s sort of a sketch here the
so-called vintage steam boiler these
have been seen in multiple places around
since the
1950s and 60s next here&#39;s one that&#39;s a
very good color illustration of it
notice the probes on it extraterrestrial
Vehicles do not have those these these
electrostatic discharge objects we&#39;re
not going to get into all the physics of
this our team understands it and we&#39;re
welcome to share that in a longer brief
with media folks and here&#39;s the 2004 off
the coast of San Diego go Tic Tac it&#39;s
fundamentally the same object
next and here it is we have a top secret
whistleblower came forward a few months
ago in 1991 so now we&#39;re talking quite
some time ago way before the 2004 event
uh that is offloading off a C130 one of
these uh uaps but it&#39;s actually a
man-made one and here you have the color
illustration this man is very afraid to
come forward he was warned not to and at
one point was told he would be quote
executed next
so here&#39;s what we need to go through
very quickly
it&#39;s a lot to unpack this is not
intended to be you know we just did a
two-day
conference right next door
the media are welcome to get that entire
event with all the details for you if
you wish to have it or people get it to
you but basically there are two types of
these so you call uaps and I&#39;ve said
this summer extraterrestrial vehicles
etvs and some are ATS or arvs Advanced
reproduction vehicles or alien
reproduction Vehicles people use
different terms the Extraterrestrial
groups are absolutely not hostile
however
screaming caps they are increasingly
concerned about human hostility and our
weapon systems which include nuclear and
scalar the so-called with Dr zahari
shared this this weekend about what
scalar electromagnetic fields are but
just to give you a sense of it you all
know an electromagnetic pulse is that&#39;s
at the speed of light
the scalar systems are instead of a wave
is a point that goes out longitudinally
some call them longitudinal waves these
have been studied Tesla talked about
scalar systems
they have been weaponized and those are
the primary systems used to Target and
hit these electromagnetic field
propulsion craft that cause them to fall
like a rock out of the sky you do not
travel from another star system and
cannot navigate a thunderstorm in New
Mexico
that ain&#39;t going to happen
so even at that point these had been
early
systems we have a FBI Memo from a field
agent that we release that&#39;s now one of
the most watched viewed documents on the
FBI website of the fact that a field
agent at the Roswell after Roswell said
to J Edgar Hoover that a disc was downed
because we had switched on a new radar
system so let me explain the euphemisms
that are used in in this field radar can
track an aircraft by bouncing a wave off
of
the fuselage
but it also can have piggybacked an
active system to not to hit it so you
can have an active weapon system
embedded in a radar system so that&#39;s
what began to be experimented with and
this is why from the mid 40s forward
there were a number of these downed
objects that we&#39;ve been able to document
if we&#39;ve documented 122 of them I
suspect there have been multiple numbers
of that
so the organ is this what&#39;s very
important about this these Technologies
are unsanctioned they are illegal
operations and this can be proven in any
court of law and we&#39;re about to launch a
massive civilian Rico action racketeer
influence corrupt organization action
against the corporations and the
individuals involved
these Technologies would immediately
solve The World&#39;s energy environmental
and poverty problems why
these are what people call a senior
executive with a big Fortune 100 company
contacted us
they&#39;re called some people say free
energy but there&#39;s zero point in Quantum
vacuum Energy Systems pulling energy out
of let&#39;s call it the fabric of
space-time these begin to be developed
Tesla knew about this so I think Elon
Musk doesn&#39;t have a Tesla as a musk a
real test so we didn&#39;t happen to plug in
I had one little battery in it but the
point is is that these Technologies
would have a huge revolutionary effect
macro economically there would be some
losers oil industry public utilities
nuclear power now wind solar surface
roads eventually would be obsolete so
it&#39;s a very significant technological
advance and for
nearing a century they have all been
withheld we just released an educational
documentary film you can all see called
The Lost century and how to reclaim it
it&#39;s a two-hour expose of this I suggest
everyone look at it if you have a chance
tonight
so these organizations have also been
targeting and successfully down into ET
Vehicles the covert group has
Technologies to launch a convincing
false flag operation detrimental to the
National Security this was the chief
topic of my briefing for three star
general Patrick Hughes uh at the
Pentagon during the Clinton years
because he was not read into this there
were some events that had happened where
you could trigger a World War because
your top folks in the Congress the White
House the Pentagon and CIA many of them
if they&#39;re not part of this covert group
this deep black group illegally they
have no idea what&#39;s going on because the
nature of TS SCI the hyper
compartmentalization that happened in
the 50s
so these actions really are a threat to
World security and National Security and
they have to be reigned in immediately
I won&#39;t choose my words carefully here a
clock I understand has been put on this
getting resolved through
hearings and other means and by the end
of this year it needs to be resolved and
that&#39;s all I will say at this point
so these actions really are dangerous
they are crimes against humans worldwide
we&#39;re going to get into that and some of
these crimes need to be referred to the
international Court some of them involve
as you&#39;ll hear from our attorney
crimes against humanity
we applaud the current actions of the
Congress and the president to sign the
bill to get to the bottom of this they
have very courageously stepped forward
we&#39;re trying to get them everything they
would need to know and I will tell you
the disclosure
project intelligence archive literally
has everything they would need to know
to get to the absolute end of this it&#39;s
been handed to them
so the chief characteristics of this
illegal secret government called the isg
projects that they&#39;re the legal the CIA
folks and Pentagon people and most of
the people in the government are victims
of this they&#39;re not culpable and people
say why is the government hiding all the
well the government is very complex and
it&#39;s highly compartmentalized these
operations have been run by a
clandestine unsanctioned group and
therefore our military and our
intelligence community and our political
leaders are in fact victims of the
secrecy I want to refer very briefly to
one of the very first CI director admir
Roscoe hillenketer who in 1961 wrote to
the New York Times and said the secrecy
around UFOs is a threat to the National
Security not the UFOs so what has
happened is it&#39;s all been turned on his
head where they&#39;re trying to say
uaps were a threat well the man-made
ones are the Extraterrestrial ones are
this has to be made crystal clear to the
American people so we don&#39;t stumble into
a absolute disaster
of Epic Proportions so these operations
that I&#39;m referring to in the United
States we have parallel projects in
Australia at Pine Gap there are projects
in the United Kingdom these are all very
Subrosa off the radar I have done
briefings for the minister of defenses
of Australia Canada and the Great
Britain none of them were read into
these projects and yet we had evidence
they were ongoing
so they also Act without acknowledging
any national boundaries what do I mean
by that
so we have an operational facilities in
other countries that we move in and out
of with alacrity
without any knowledge or approval of
that government
so this is also not good obviously and
dangerous but because of the nature of
our operations which can be cloaked that
have these eight T arv Vehicles they can
move off radar they can go in and out of
areas and we have witnesses who can
prove what I just said
um blackmail bribery and intimidation is
the stock in trade and it&#39;s the
operational core of this illegal secret
government program many of our
whistleblowers have been
threatened and have been blackmailed and
in the case of some of us attempts at
bribery including myself
next
so these are the actions we recommend
immediately now that this is all coming
out by the Congress
and the government next
and I want to remind everyone who&#39;s in
office and all military know this I do
solemnly swear to affirm or a firm that
I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States
against all enemies foreign and domestic
that will bear true faith and allegiance
to the same that I take this obligation
freely without any mental reservation or
purpose of evasion and that I will well
and Faithfully discharge the duties of
the office on which I am about to enter
so help me God
next
so this is quite a list I want to go
through very quickly these have been
conveyed over to the government
in various offices this investigation of
the UAP issue and based on the
intelligence archive should happen
immediately and be increased in its pace
and scope the presidential executive
order needs to occur immediately to
stand down all targeting of these
extraterrestrial Vehicles by these
covert projects because it is dangerous
and it is an existential threat to
security for the entire world not just
our country the executive order
requiring all military intelligence
contractors and other agencies of the
U.S government to disclose to Congress
and White House all information materiel
and Technologies and locations and
related assets if not come complied with
within around six months we think that
the offending party should be prosecuted
criminally for treason and other crimes
against the United States
the executive order
we need an executive order where the
state department and Pentagon coordinate
a global diplomatic as opposed to
military response to these
extraterrestrial civilizations should
have happened Barry Goldwater Center
Goldwater told me it was a excuse my
language God damn mistake then and
goddamn mistake now that this was ever
kept secret like this he was not allowed
in
this project when he tried to get in
general Curtis LeMay told him he could
never ask him about it again we have
that whole trail with former Senator
Goldwater
so the we also need to have a
an executive order so that the U.S
patent office that has seized these zero
point and related Technologies under
bogus application of the National
Security
laws and we have a copy of of an
inventor had one of these happen to him
those have to be reversed those patents
have to be released and inventors and
scientists around the world that have
come across these look the laws of the
universe are Universal and they&#39;ve been
discovered by folks they get grabbed
either put on a black shelf or they get
this National Security order slapped on
them those have to be reversed and those
should be released open source to the
public
thank you we also need an executive
board to immediately require that the
U.S space force and Pentagon coordinate
assets with the state department the
United Nations and other governments to
initiate further open communication with
these civilizations the space force
could be very useful in this regard if
it&#39;s deployed properly all of the
military would be very important and I
want to emphasize both the people who
work in most of these corporations and
in these agencies and the Pentagon have
no knowledge excuse me of these illegal
operations and and we should not paint
them all with this the brush of being
culpable it&#39;s not there&#39;s these are the
Rogue elements
an executive order to immediately
disclose Advanced Energy generating
Technologies should happen these are
held by some of these corporations and
agencies this would within 10 to 20
years end all pollution on Earth and all
Global poverty this is not a pipe frame
those Technologies are extant they have
been around for a while and we need them
and we need them 60 years ago 70 years
ago
Sports
next
so you know these are going to continue
and we don&#39;t have time to go through all
of these so the reason I&#39;m going through
these is that there&#39;s a specific action
plan that we have you can read these
they&#39;ll be in the Press briefing
materials if you need them and I think
it needs to happen very quickly because
this is all going to come out and there
needs to be an organized response next
the Congressional recommendations
Congress should immediately pass a 50
billion dollar research Bill to develop
and bring forward these safe
Technologies related to zero point and
Quantum vacuum Energy Systems we
provided 50 some billion for the chip
industry this is way more important and
frankly it needs to come out very very
soon given what we&#39;re facing with the
climate and Global poverty issues that&#39;s
something that needs to be put on the
front burner it is certainly a more
important agenda than the partisan
bickering that we see today
amnesty Provisions need to be passed
explicitly
uh four people wanting to come forward I
have a major number of folks who are
Executives corporate also with
whistleblowers some of whom have been
involved in activities that are not
legal if they come forward they should
have immunity so that this can all be
Unwound in a orderly and peaceful way
that needs to happen very quickly and it
should be included in a bill this year
the Congress should also convey to open
hearings on this I understand from
discussions with a member of the House
Government reform and oversight
committee that this has been discussed
by the chairman and the speaker of the
house I think that should be put on the
front burner and move forward very
quickly we will provide all information
and have already provided all
information they will need there are I&#39;m
sure other archives that can be brought
to bear and other whistleblowers are now
going to be coming forward probably
several a week at this point uh Congress
should also pass legislation to
explicitly protect the personal safety
like a witness protection program it is
not an exaggeration to say that in the
30 some years I&#39;ve been dealing with
this I have dealt with multiple people
who have been flat out threatened with
execution
uh one of them is sitting here at this
table perhaps more
next
so this next slide
one of the things I just want to mention
is the Lost century was crowdfunded
and look at the subtitle how to reclaim
it
because there&#39;s a century of
technological and scientific progress
that would greatly benefit all of
humanity not just United States we all
live on this beautiful sphere floating
through space together it needs to very
much come forward it&#39;s a hundred years
is long enough for secrecy next
so I want to introduce someone I&#39;ve
gotten to know we first met some last
year by the way all of these military
guys have been and corporate folks have
been to the Aero skiff
the secure compartment information
facility the disclosure project has
funded all of this for for their
personal needs and travel that&#39;s why we
appreciate your donations and
contributions but Colonel Heckert
he is a retired and very decorated
United States Air Force command pilot
during his extensive career Colonel
Heckert flew over a hundred combat
reconnaissance mission including 11
years in high altitude aircraft
developed by the Lockheed Skunk Works
these were not the healing reproduction
vehicles such as the U2 and the tr1 and
flew alongside the famed SR-71 Blackbird
in the late 70s and early 1980s Colonel
Heckard commanded the nation&#39;s largest
nuclear monitoring facilities and
radiological processing lab and was
responsible for the Airborne collection
of debris from nuclear explosions
worldwide later he was commander of
classified operations in the Middle East
and subsequently served as a special
Project Director at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Ohio
where he was involved with countless
classified development operations
Colonel Heckard also spent time working
at a groom Lake Area 51 where he
conducted flight operations and project
management evaluation and research
please welcome my friend and hero of our
country Colonel pepper
please please
well thank you for being here and
listening
I need to establish just a couple facts
I&#39;ve been involved with SCI vaults and
code words since 1964.
and my last access with the Air Force
and other agencies was 1967.
for the last
eight months I&#39;ve been involved again in
FCI
discussions thanks to this gentleman and
all of these people sitting next to you
and all of those volunteers
the things I want to share first just a
little bit of historical information
quickly you know the name Kelly Johnson
Kelly Johnson and the gentleman Ben Rich
who succeeded him I I got to know very
well
I&#39;ve got a
1953 UFO report signed by Kelly Johnson
and his engineers and in that same UFO
thing
about four hours later it appears ore&#39;s
house
and I Dr Greer has a letter that Kelly
Johnson sent to the National director of
intelligence
saying this is real this needs to be
investigated
I am a
very fortunate to have been a pilot
I&#39;ve got over 7 000 hours of time
I currently live in Alaska with my wife
Alice
and a whole bunch of grandchildren and
that&#39;s a real blessing
the two documented encounters and I&#39;m
sorry that they have that up on the
screen are they just shown that on
I I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s available but
these are the two airplanes that I flew
that I had UFO encounters the first one
was during the latter stages of the
Vietnam War
I was flying an operation called
linebacker three going into Leos I was
in an orbit at 14 500 feet just south of
the ocean border and my two armed
escorts because the RF is unarmed and
they&#39;re there to protect me we&#39;re
delayed on takeoff so I&#39;m doing just a
racetrack type of orbit
there are things that monitor in Warfare
called GCI sites these are radar sites
that Vector in the fighters to the the
people that are intercepting you
what happens next is that I get an alert
from three GCI sites and the early
Foreman a-wax
that I&#39;ve got traffic that is a fast
mover near Mach 1 coming out of North
Vietnam Laos heading for me in orbit
that concerns me because my armed escort
isn&#39;t there
now I&#39;m completing about halfway down
this next pathway
and they tell me oh don&#39;t worry that
Target is above seventy thousand feet
and you know it can&#39;t get at you at this
point
so I&#39;m a little relieved but then I
finally get to see it and it&#39;s on a
wavelength of light that I&#39;ve only seen
one other place and that is in a nuclear
pile on an active nuclear
power generation and it&#39;s called teller
light it is very unique very white very
very bright
so we look up and it&#39;s an 11 o&#39;clock
and over here off my left shoulder about
10 o&#39;clock
my back seaters is stumbling to make
their emergency detection systems and
our defensive systems active
we watch this thing and it&#39;s way above
there and I&#39;m a little relieved
until all of a sudden through the
midterm
mid term of the
the orbit
it comes from seventy thousand feet down
to twelve thousand five hundred feet in
two seconds
and now it&#39;s tracking off my nose
and staying at five nautical miles away
that sets off everything in my aircraft
the three gcis and the a-wax are really
concerned about me at this point and as
we go on Parallel with this thing flying
at five miles an hour
I&#39;m really concerned and then they asked
me will you intercept this if you can
well the
airplane the rf4c is a Mach 2 plus
airplane
I&#39;ve been in flight for a little while
and so I&#39;ve probably if I go to after
Bernie only have about 15 minutes of
fuel left but I agree to intercept the
reason I did was I have a new
one-of-a-kind IR infrared sensor but
it&#39;s on the bottom of the airplane
so
my backseater and I agree hey this is
important we can see this we need to
document it I go to afterburner
and we accept
accelerate very quickly through Mach 1
go up to about Mach 1.2
and I close to within three nautical
miles of this UFO
and we&#39;ve got it now on our radar we&#39;ve
got it pegged the guy in the back seat
can&#39;t see it on his display because that
sensor is pointing down so I pitch up do
a super sonic climb up and he says we
got it we got it we got it
that white light
at three miles goes out of sight within
less than two seconds
and they say don&#39;t worry about it it&#39;s
above 80 000 feet in those two seconds
I
go back to the home base because I&#39;m out
of fuel land all that material all the
mission material is confiscated and I&#39;m
told don&#39;t talk about it
well what happens next is I&#39;m not happy
with that answer because I&#39;ve seen
something very very real I call the GCI
site
on What&#39;s called the Audubon or
telephone system I talk I say hey I&#39;d
like to talk to the senior controller
that was on duty tell him that&#39;s the UFO
pilot that they were just controlling
and he comes on the phone and says hey
we&#39;re all really excited about this
and then I hear him see yes sir okay
says buy click
I couldn&#39;t talk to the other two GCI
sites and that goes away and I never
know anything about it until later
the next one is on a u2r and that&#39;s a
blackbird I&#39;m at 70 000 feet above that
on the DMZ of Korea this has been a
combo Mission which means I&#39;m taking
photo intelligence during the daylight
and I&#39;m doing what is called an elent
comment mission in a butterfly track
three miles off the DMZ
we have a sun shade that protects you
during the daytime in the U2 because the
sunlight&#39;s so intense you&#39;re about
above
98 of the atmosphere at that point
anyway I have that sliding back
everything&#39;s looking good and all of a
sudden I am blinded by that same
frequency light from above
it turns my black Airplane White
and the U2 as the last ditch
saving message method to avoid a missile
can do a turn at less than seven
nautical miles at the same altitude the
SR-71 is at
SR-71 takes 160 miles to do that same
u-turn
there is nothing to my knowledge in the
world that it is man-made that can stay
with the U2 at that altitude turning the
max turn unless it&#39;s another U2
this light tracks me from above
I can show you later missiles that come
between me and my other rf4
my airplane&#39;s got holes in it they never
made me abort a reconnaissance
operational mission
this scared me so bad that I had to
abort but when I land normal debrief
does not take place they just say
go shower and go to your room
okay
so what happens next in my career
is that uh
because of my wife&#39;s concern
she says hey we gotta take a respite of
this by the way she worked
at air America at
udorn Air Force Base in Thailand for the
CIA
anyway
she says we&#39;ve got to get out of this
you know you&#39;re getting a little too
sense and now we have two children and
I&#39;m worried
so I take an assignment to what&#39;s called
avtac
and avtech was established in its
predecessor in 1945 due to the
development and the concern of little
boy and fat man the two nuclear bombs
those are important because we have a
detailed history of air sampling
pollution sampling and it was primary
pollution that they were concerned about
radiologically
from 1945 on
at that point I&#39;m assigned as a base
commander level I have sights all over
and I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t show you a slide
of that but we&#39;re involved in things
like the raising of k129 it&#39;s a video
that&#39;s been uh put out about five years
ago that shows my site at attu detected
the breakup of that submarine
that same site at attu and my seismic
sound will do will sense a nuclear
underwater deep underwater test out of
South Africa and that&#39;s called the Vela
v e l a incident
and my boss at headquarters is fired
over that instant but two years later
because the administration denied that
that test ever took place
the vice Chief staff the Air Force
General Mathis the chief scientist for
the White House and the Secretary of the
Interior come to my vault
and they want a briefing on our data and
if we really think that that happened
they left leaving it really happened and
as a result South Africa destroys four
nuclear warheads they had
Israel will never admit that they were
part of that joint venture
from there
I go to Europe as the first one of the
first four in the tr1 program
and
through just accidental events again
because of the
sickness that our Intel officer goes
through I&#39;m the only one that has a code
word clearance
and so I&#39;m assigned to do his duties
while he recovers
and I&#39;m exposed to all of the peacetime
aerial reconnaissance data in Europe and
Africa
I&#39;m in charge of scheduling those events
and trying to get us integrated with the
tr1 into the peacetime aerial program in
the European theater
from there this is supposed to be a
four-year assignment at the 14th month
of my tour in Europe
I am required to or I was asked do I
want to fly a high flyer again and of
course I said yes they do a process when
you go to a classified site
called Sheep dipping and so they put
fictitious orders
in your official files
I go overseas and work in the Middle
East and actually work with Delta Force
on a hijacking in June of 1985
during that tour
and we lost a soldier on the ramp but
this is in direct
coordination with MI6 because it&#39;s the
British base and that&#39;s now Declassified
but uh
it was quite an experience the only
problem is that there was a conflict
in the chain of command I was supposed
to be the chief test pilot for the
YouTube program back at Edwards that&#39;s a
follow-on assignment they promised me
instead that assignment&#39;s canceled I&#39;m
held in that remote location for 10 days
my wife was about to disown me
and I am told I&#39;m going to write
Patterson Air Force Base
the new job for the first six months is
director of high altitude test for the
Air Force
the next job and this is through the end
of my career is the program director for
the U2 tr1
SR-71 and other Advanced classified
programs
I need to transfer to this and tell you
about a recovery that we did called
project morning light it is a
reconnaissance satellite that comes down
and eventually parts of it end up in
Gray slate Lake and there there&#39;s
radioactivity that&#39;s
cleaned up from that that also involved
a U2 or pardon me in a UFO
the
the other thing I wanted to just share
with you is the three events in area 51.
and
those events themselves
are first a security breach
and the reason I&#39;m there is because we
some of my funds and my black programs
and I was required to justify those that
blood black budget to the the House and
Senate intelligence select intelligence
committee on a quarterly basis
some of those funds are not being spent
my projects aren&#39;t going forward I&#39;m
there and I overhear two people talking
about using
Navy sensors to photograph an aerial
vehicle that&#39;s flying at night and
they&#39;re going to make a lot of money
well I report that immediately those
people are arrested and I don&#39;t know
anything more about that event except
none of that imagery they took got
released
the next one is that uh I have a number
of cost overruns in my projects I&#39;m back
and I look and
I&#39;m finding that other programs are
using my funds diverted for their use
and that&#39;s what&#39;s slowing my
developments and I&#39;m very upset about it
the last part and this is uh
gosh
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m having my senior moments
if you&#39;re giving
but uh
I will let you but I&#39;m available
afterwards I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve taken so long
I know this is a tiring briefing
thank you
very little hero
thank you
thank you lieutenant colonel Heckert
there&#39;s a lot more I say each of these
Witnesses have stories to unpack from
for example Area 51 and what have you it
would take hours but I want to give you
a sense that this is really the tip of
the iceberg these represent point five
percent of the disclosure project
witness list
so the next gentleman I&#39;d like to
introduce has become a a figure of of
great support for us he&#39;s a Marine who
in 2009 in Indonesia had a direct
encounter with one of the man-made
operations and he is Michael Herrera he
is very courageously come forward the
first time he contacted me because I
know of these sort of operations that he
came across on his mission
I told him that every single person I
knew who knew about what he had seen had
not lived to tell this story he is
enormously courageous
thank you and welcome to Michael Herrera
well thank you all for being here what
I&#39;m about to tell you hasn&#39;t been
something that I&#39;ve disclosed until
recently in the help of Dr Greer among
other people so I appreciate your help
with this
in 2009 we were my unit which was the
most decorated infantry battalion in the
entire Marine Corps which was second
Battalion fifth Marines was called in to
do humanitarian assistance operations
out in the Philippines which was
Operation kitsano
which we were attached to the 31st
Marine Expeditionary Unit which conducts
maritime operations all throughout
southeast Asia in conjunction with the
seventh naval fleet which houses one
Landing Hilo deck or lhd among lpds
which is what I was on called a USS
Denver ironically that&#39;s where I&#39;m from
so kind of felt like home
now during that operation in quetzana in
the Philippines
they had actually heard that a tsunami
and earthquake hit the western part of
Sumatra which is Western Indonesia
Padang City more specifically out of all
the ships in the southern Fleet the ship
I was on was the only one that was
routed to that location which was oddly
strange but then again this is my first
humanitarian operation so I don&#39;t know
the logistics of it but if the skipper
the ship would probably know that
information
so this happened September 30th we end
up getting called and dropped anchor
around October 8th we are briefed in the
ward room which is the officer&#39;s mess
where they eat like their cafeteria per
se
and we&#39;re briefed that there is some of
President Obama&#39;s family members that
are present on either in the city or
somewhere near there they had a seal
platoon that was ready to go to retrieve
those people
um us knowing well that uh Indonesia is
also the second largest terrorist
Capital where they train these guys and
they&#39;ll send them up to whatever theater
of operation where anybody wants a piece
of the United States they can they ship
them up to go handle it so we know that
well and um we were then brief that we
were going to be armed during this
operation just to also provide security
for the transportation coming to
basically drop off medical supplies
Sheltering items food purified water
things like that
so they ended up selecting certain
Marines to go ahead and do this we were
only in sticks of six six Marines so it
had ncos on top of other Marines to help
with that so they we again boarded ch-53
Super Stallions which are gigantic
helicopters that are roughly 100 feet
long I love the design of them it&#39;s my
personal favorite
um we&#39;ll end up boarding this on the
ship and we flew to the South Western
part of the city which is pedang looked
a lot different through satellite
imagery that I&#39;ve recently seen back
then is a lot different especially
because most of it was decimated on fire
Rubble flooded you name it basically the
worst kind of scenario you could ever
see
from then once we touched down on this
Landing Strip it took probably about two
minutes
and then again the Pilot&#39;s got radio
confirmation to go ahead and drop us
into certain parts so we again dropped
to a hasty LZ which took probably about
six seven minutes to fly to from that
position
and uh we dropped to aclz we got off the
bird and what we&#39;re instructed to do at
that point through the briefing was to
push to a high ground at least to get
better observation as a marine the
Tactical advantage that you get from
having a
you know observation from a top point is
you see everything clearly you could
also you know coordinate from there at
that time we had did a tactical column
which we were able to get eyes on pretty
much everything especially with six
Marines so we have the effective uh
communication at that point if we need
to engage we can properly do it within
the amount of ammunition we&#39;ve got as
well as the weapons that we got which
were only m16a4s
so at that point we decided to push
forward we tracked up about 300 meters
at this time I have a Panasonic camera
that has ability to take photographs it
has a you know ability to take videos
obviously
when we got to this high point I was
taking video camera and I had actually
turned to the north which just kind of
slopes down
and right there was something that stuck
out like a sore thumb especially with
jungle terrain things like that junk you
know vegetation very green stuff was
something that stuck out so well it&#39;s
always going to be basically imprisoned
in my mind for the rest of my life and
it has been for 14 years was something
that was rotating
and it was transitioning between colors
like a light matte gray as well as a
dark matte black so in between that&#39;s
what it kept it was very smooth
we had all looked at each other as we
got online and we decided to investigate
the further thing I want to say is that
I actually took pictures and video of
this before we actually trucked down we
had a dump pouch where we basically if
we expend ammunition we want to retain
our magazines so we put those there
so I dropped my camera in there and we
decided to go down we didn&#39;t have any
Communications which was weird and that
was a very odd thing and it&#39;s something
that either could have been good that we
didn&#39;t or it could have been something
that could have been very bad
um and it just how however you want to
look at that once we got down this slope
we were approximately 150 meters away
from this craft when I got to the when
we all got to the point where we could
see it just like behind here again Mr
shrat phenomenal job
you can see that the craft here actually
had uh roughly about 300 feet and the
reason why I know this is because you
could fit three of the helicopters that
we flew in on underneath this craft it
was rotating a clockwise motion the
panels here that you see the black ones
at least three of them was like avanta
black very dark I have no idea what that
was
on the very top there was like a pyramid
structure that you could see the
shadowing of it which would elicit that
was a pyramid structure
and it had an audible hump to it kind of
like a guitar amp if you were to unplug
that or like a Transformer it&#39;s very
audible if I was to hear that sound
again I could tell you okay it&#39;s
probably this thing or something similar
to that it&#39;s very distinct and the way
that it was floating which was about 10
you know 15 20 feet off the ground it
was kind of a very eerie thing to see
because I&#39;ve never seen anything like
that in my life when we got up to that
point
we were then intercepted by a team of
soldiers or Rogue military force if you
will the most concerning thing about
this is they all had American dialects
they had American Gear they had otvs
black they had black camouflage they had
very similar setups to what we have but
more high speed something what you would
see special operation Operation groups
these days have they had no insignias on
they had no ranks they had nothing that
would signify who they were they had
black ball caps they had m4a4s that were
equipped with acogs which was a step up
from what we were currently issued as
well as PEC 16 IR illumination devices
that you use for night vision and night
patrols things like that
so we were engaged we had eight of them
drop put the drop on us we could audibly
hear them flow the safety selectors off
they basically started screaming at us
telling them what we were doing we were
not allowed to be there who were we with
what were we doing there threatened that
they could kill us right then and there
we could get lost in the jungle they
could throw us out of a helicopter if
they needed to it was very
nerve-wracking at that point especially
looking to my fellow Marines and seeing
their reactions on their faces too we
were all freaking scared to say
nonetheless
so with that being said each Marine was
then patted down along with myself we
were had our weapons taken from us they
were basically cleared in condition for
which means they had no round chamber no
magazine in they dumped our magazines
out of our mag pouches as well into the
deck and then again because the Marine
Corps Order how things are with that we
were told to keep our military ID in our
left breast pocket so they knew that
they asked for our military
identification we gave it to them
obviously because they have guns in our
face so provided that to them they had
something that looked like modern day
smartphones but this is 2009 so it&#39;s not
really as high tech compared to
obviously today so they took some
pictures of our military idea and then
they had something to remind me of a bat
system which a Biometrics tracking
system that we have we would use this is
for insurgents or any things like that
it would take fingerprints it would take
retina skins it would take pictures of
them and document them so if there&#39;s
other militaries that were coming to
relieve our post they would actually
have this information too to know who
they are dealing with that&#39;s what it
reminded me of and I had trouble
scanning the IDS
as this is going on we&#39;re going back
between these guys as well as what&#39;s
going on in the background at that time
there was four of these trucks which
were f-350s they were up armored they
were pretty beefy they had weapon cases
that I&#39;ve seen before because of
something that we&#39;ve actually loaded
weapons into they had two of them that
were in the back of each truck
they also had these containers that was
Illustrated right here which come to
find out through recent relevations from
yesterday from uh somebody who came
forward to Dr Greer I don&#39;t know who
they are but what they had told him and
what he has told me is that this
gentleman knows exactly what these were
used for because they had like a
cylinder on the front which is either
for oxygen or what I have hypothesized
was for vacuum sealing which believed me
to suspect that they were smuggling
narcotics or drugs come to find out it&#39;s
more disturbing than that this gentleman
has first-hand account with this and
says that it was for people
it&#39;s very disheartening especially
because that part of the world have
already gotten ravaged and is something
that is very hard to see right now
because of what I&#39;ve witnessed and it&#39;s
very disheartening and this is why I&#39;m
up here
so they loaded these onto this platform
that you can see right there
and as I got up there like I said I was
going back and forth these guys are
still searching our stuff they&#39;re still
you know pointing their weapons at us
and after the last two trucks that I saw
that actually gone into that platform
unloaded they had four guys on each
truck that would unload everything
however they did it I can&#39;t tell you
because again I was focused on this as
well and these trucks drove off as that
happened this platform actually rose up
off the ground itself
the top part of the craft actually met
it down in the middle like this
and I formed in one solid piece
it floated right above the tree line as
soon as it was able to break that tree
line it actually had the on the corners
of each of these which was an octagonal
shape craft by the way on each corner it
emanated a light it was either red
yellow green or blue only those four
colors I can distinctly remember it
didn&#39;t make any additional high-pitched
sounds when it rose up once it got past
that tree line it shut over to the left
basically where the ocean was at uh so
fast I would estimate probably three
four five thousand miles an hour
instantaneous like that there was no
rotor wash no exhaust that would disturb
the trees vegetation the Coconuts that
were on these trees were not even
touched it produced no Sonic Boom this
thing was so fast
so as that happened they basically had
told us to turn around as we turned
around kind of a couple things that went
through my head at that point was that
we&#39;re done
they actually started loading our
magazines into our vet back into our
vest in a way that would be hard to get
them to put them into a weapon and to
actually you know charge the weapon
actually put it around in a chamber so
um they put those in they actually slung
our M16s on their back for us but when
they did it million of course not really
issued the best gear especially at that
time so the slings back then where I
would say subpar quality cut my neck
pretty good and they you know kind of
went in that motion and made sure they
were secured so we couldn&#39;t really get
them as easy and they always courted us
back up this slope and they won they
told us they were not gonna we were not
allowed to look back
two that we were not able to talk about
this they were actually two of the guys
were actually talking about either hey
should we smoke these guys right now you
know that&#39;s what they kept saying it was
kind of feeding more into the fear at
that point because again I don&#39;t know
who these guys are I know they had
American Gear they had American sidearms
as well
um
if these guys have um actually taken
oath like we have and then why they&#39;re
going against people like us and even
willing to kill um servicemen who just
even stumbled onto this is just blows my
mind and it&#39;s very sick
so as we broke atop this hill we decided
to book him and we ran back to the LZ
there was a gunnery sergeant that was
attached to the ship I don&#39;t know this
gentleman personally but I know he&#39;s
very unhappy with seeing us because we
had actually had our weapons slung we
were not combat effective at that point
if we needed to be they asked he asked
specifically why we were we didn&#39;t tell
him exactly why we just came up an
excuse and then
um we waited for the next ch-53 to
approach and we got on board flew back
to the ship we turned our weapons in
Back to the Armory we took our gear off
back in our birthing and we went
upstairs to be debriefed by an admiral
that I&#39;ve never seen before and it was
kind of somebody who&#39;s out of place I
don&#39;t know if he has any kind of
relevance to this at all but if that&#39;s
the case if he does I hope he comes
forward with that information it&#39;d be
very helpful
so as we&#39;re going to go ahead and fast
track to a couple days later which we
end up in Subic Bay which is like the
Party Town in Philippines
so we had three days there of Liberty
the first night I come back because we
had to report back to the ship each
night we were not allowed to stay out in
town
my rack was on my cam or my camera was
on my rack
and the memory card that was in it was
out and my battery was out of the camera
missing as well so all of that was
missing the only thing that was there
was the camera mind you I had my locker
secured I had other stuff that was
basically piled on top of that camera so
whoever did it knew what the hell
happened
so
um after that
um the other thing that was also notable
with that was each of the Marines that
were with me also had their cell phones
taken that they brought even though they
didn&#39;t bring them on the ignition all
their stuff was missing the other stuff
the other people in actual platoon never
had their stuff touched it was only a
six that were affected
so
fast tracking back when we were turned
back to Okinawa
one day I got a call from the duty that
was in the barracks each Barracks has
like a duty of Marines they&#39;re you know
making sure they&#39;re still order things
like that he had been told that I needed
to go up to the CP so he informed me so
I had hightailed it up there
and oddly enough there was nobody in the
building except for one gentleman who
was wearing Air Force dress blues that
was missing a name tag which I
understand in Air Force policy or
regulations that they were supposed to
wear a name tag and he did not have that
again the proper gradient of the day
getting the salute he had pulled me into
an office and he has said you are not
allowed to tell anybody in your chain of
command I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a general I
don&#39;t care if it&#39;s anybody you are not
allowed to talk about what happened you
can go to prison for this or you could
be killed
so he slid over a non-disclosure
agreement and it had two things that I
can recall to this day as I quickly
skimmed through it because again I had
thought we were going to forget about
this whole mess and uh one was said
tssci
and the other said Indonesia there&#39;s
only two things I can recall out of that
so
I was forced to sign that I signed it
and I had got the hell out of there as
quick as I could I before I did that I
tried to ask him who he was and he would
not tell me who he was so I hightailed
it back and I have not spoken about it
ever since I was able to recently
because what the law passed but that is
my account for you guys this is also an
urging for anybody in Washington DC
who&#39;s a political figure
please get this under control because
there are people who are either being
hurt or killed by this and it&#39;s
something that needs to be addressed
please
thank you Mr Heckert I do want to share
that also when we reached out to him we
have the names of the other five people
in the platoon of course these will not
be disclosed because they have requested
their names not B but there&#39;s
corroboration one of them wrote to Mr
Herrera when we asked that Mr herrer
reach out to the other uh folks involved
in this horrible incident which now is
quite clear from other sources involves
a type of human slave trade used in
covert programs very criminal operations
he said hey man this is asking too much
and it&#39;s not worth the risk my family a
military career far exceed anything you
are asking of me is not worth my life
or jeopardizing my family I know we go
back but this is asking too much you
need to get out of whatever you are in
and don&#39;t get me involved with this mess
my career isn&#39;t worth helping you don&#39;t
ever ask me to do this [ __ ] excuse my
language again
this is from a marine platoon member now
many of the people in the disclosure
project intelligence archive are folks
who have been had that response because
they need protection and their career
some are still in the military one I&#39;m
dealing with still has a TS SEI
clearance who who contracts with one of
our agencies uh here in outside D.C so I
think that this has to be dealt with in
an orderly fashion immediately by the
Congress and by the president next I&#39;d
like to introduce Stephen digna Jr he&#39;s
a U.S army of veteran disabled due to an
incident he also was a witness to a
Raytheon Corporation event at Fort Irwin
California his story is very involved
he&#39;s just going to give you a few of the
highlights and the interest of time but
thank you very much
good afternoon everyone I&#39;m going to
look down and read this uh I have a
brain injury so it gives me a problems
so I apologize
our room
my name is Stephen Michael digna Jr uh
doctor I&#39;m sorry these are slipping my
hands here
that&#39;s okay
my name is Stephen Michael digna Jr the
following testimony is true and
inaccurate that as it can be at this
time to the best of my ability and I
prepared to swear this testimony under
oath before the Senate and Congress
I&#39;m a former Sergeant in the United
States Army I began active duty service
in 1999 and I served until 2002.
I was used assigned to the U.S army
training center W4 j9 alpha alpha for
Irma California located in the Mojave
Desert inside uh Death Valley near The
Barstow California in 2000.
I was assigned to Alpha Company group
live fire combat engine near division uh
computer Sports systems and basically
for civilians it&#39;s management for live
fire operations I acted as a hub between
the operations group intelligence
planners ground Team Air Force and Star
Wars programs
oh thank you doctor
in July of 2001 I was observing a live
fire practice at a level from an
observation deck at approximately three
stories high from the desert floor I saw
a craft in the distance at approximately
200 feet off the ground measuring 107
approximately 172 feet across strongly
strongly remembers resembling a hovering
B2 spirit
upon first glance my eyes were adjusting
to the darkness I could see seven lights
in a v-shape
after that I closed my eyes for
approximately 30 seconds to allow them
to adjust lighting conditions
we were running red lights throughout
the bunker due to the current live fire
exercise the range was hot that means
rounds were being fired and lives are at
risk at all times
uh
this was interrupted by a very very
ominous call netcall said ceasefire sees
fire seize fire came from one of our
Observer controllers on the ground it
was about 20 27 teams out there uh and
they they kept soldiers alive and
trained them
um
sorry thank you doctor
once my eye is adjusted I can make out
the general shape of The Craft
there were two men from Raytheon present
I pulled out my night vision goggles to
get a better look
at the craft uh it appeared to be
generating seven lights along its wings
and underbelly I noticed another smaller
craft oriented on the right side and at
the same height as the first craft
approximately 75 feet to 100 yards to
its right
the second craft was jet black v-shaped
pointed towards the first craft
this craft had equally joined spaced
rectangular sections forming the hull
the craft head a gimbal rack on that
deployed from the bottom of the craft
approximately five to six holographic uh
lights uh holographic emitting lights
were pointed directly at the first craft
that was my assumption uh due to the
fact that they were displaying a strange
color within my mvg goggles anyone that
knows the old school you know to the
Circa 2000 mvgs they don&#39;t emit color
they give you green Grays and blacks
I was seeing colors within my night
vision goggles this was not normal
and uh it was my assumption that perhaps
this was a hologram being projected from
the other craft I can&#39;t confirm that
however that was my assessment at the
time and my suspicion at the time I
wanted to throw a baseball at it but I
didn&#39;t have one just to see if it was
tangible and solid
the second craft was jet black v-shaped
uh
oh I&#39;m sorry jumped a little space here
thank you for the bullets uh Raven the
craft in the gimbal rack were deployed
from the bottom of the craft and
approximately five or six lights sorry
Dr Greer guys I I goofed up and that&#39;s a
part of the brain injury I suffered
during explosion on the live fire range
one of the two men on the observation
deck uh observation deck from Raytheon
noticed the night vision goggles I had
he went from chattering cheerfully they
were pretty relaxed they&#39;d seen these
before it wasn&#39;t abnormal to them uh he
looked at me with a very very severe
look of disapproval and anger that I had
at that point we both they both went
calmly inside probably a little bit
angry and uh I felt it as though I had
crossed the line
I took another look with my night vision
goggles
the reason this event was not uh
reported was due to the fact that it was
not unidentified I&#39;m gonna repeat this
very clearly to the cameras this craft
was not unidentified this was on our
birds and uh to The Observer controller
they called that out on the Range I&#39;m
not going to put his call sign out uh
Roger up eyes on Hands-On confirmation
that&#39;s our bird but she doesn&#39;t need
wind to get lift she was hovering
stationary
uh
this was uh I&#39;m going to interject here
sorry guys this was very dangerous this
light this craft showed up on
unscheduled I got no notification my job
was to maintain command and control and
to be the Hub and uh top Observer
controller for the Tactical operation
consent uh Command Center for live fire
desert warfare that&#39;s the largest live
fire Warfare Center for Desert Warfare
on the planet and uh in history
so uh any any moving objects that are on
that dinner on that desert uh floor or
in those guys are supposed to be
coordinated between myself and another
group that I directly worked with with
the civilian Personnel to Raytheon and
the air United States Air Force uh
so to get back to the statements here uh
the reason this the event was uh not
skip
all right well this is going to jump in
a little I was the fastest promoted
soldier in 25 years on the post and I
was the youngest number one control seat
holder uh at Ford or an NTC facility in
history
uh that held the title the voice of the
desert uh when I queued my mic at my FMB
station it shut down all radios and I
could shut down the range for safety
reasons or for medical back calls safety
reports weather reports and any other
thing that was commanded by Me by my uh
superiors
uh
that&#39;s I skipped over that but I filled
it in good approximately five to seven
uh days later the
sorry guys this is personal uh this
affected the rest of my marriage my life
and uh my relationship with my child
approximately five to seven days later
following the following incident took
place
um Fordham and road it&#39;s the one road
leading uh into the base during uh
weekend pass after the show
uh
my wife and I had uh taken a pass to go
see a movie
um
and it this this took a place right
after the live fire bunker about five
seven five to seven days afterwards
we skipped the second movie or halfway
through I was really tired just got back
from running the range uh 78 hour shifts
with no relief
we passed a dry lake bed on the right
hand side I&#39;ve got that exact
information already turned into the
proper authorities thank you Dr Greer
and all of his team people out there
please get ready to come out
saying they got an old uh old friend of
mine well new friend but uh he reminded
me of an old saying they have at Fort
Benning Georgia it says follow me
there&#39;s another saying we have at the
signal Corps Academy
it&#39;s uh
it&#39;s on the badge it says propatriot
vigilance or vigilous that means
watchful of the nation
and there&#39;s another group of men that I
served with and I tried to keep them
alive every day to the best of my
ability same guys that blew me up
and I still love them today and I ask
for amnesty for all of the information
I&#39;m going to save from here on in is uh
these boys are on the ground on the
hottest spots in the planet along with
these other soldiers and they&#39;re dying
out there
they&#39;re out there killing people
under false pretenses I&#39;ve also turned
information in that may be able to prove
that to the proper authorities thanks to
Dr Greer and his team his team so far
has been accommodating polite honest
respectful
and this man is my new general
he leads the way
so rally up rally on me this man is the
way he speaks the truth he is sound
apologize Dr Greer I&#39;ve been waiting to
say that for a long time uh I thought
they would laugh at me and look at me
like I&#39;m a lunatic however I brought my
data I brought I brought the information
they stripped my information said I had
a driver&#39;s badge
and a Service ribbon I had two
accommodation medals and I had total
seven certificates they put me in for an
arcom which is the highest award you can
get for uh
for a non-deployable base I&#39;m a
non-combatant
but I&#39;m as close as you can get to being
one
those boys out there we receive kit
reports every day that means killed in
training had I been in a real tactical
operation Command Center uh or bunker on
the Range like the one that just got hit
in Ukraine
then I&#39;d be sending men out to die every
day those guys hated the voices of the
desert
because we gave them to commands to send
their troops into danger into death
even if we knew that they were just the
decoys for the real Mission so I&#39;m gonna
have to jump back to this I apologize
Raven and everyone for for going off
track but that had to be said
um
back to the story in hand this isn&#39;t a
story it&#39;s my story this is a real story
and uh
don&#39;t forget that this is real this
can&#39;t be made up and I can give you the
exact locations I can drive Dr Greer and
all of the command Congress everyone
there to the bunker so we passed a dry
lake bed on the right hand side my
driver&#39;s side mirror reflected a
powerful white light into my eyes
I saw a bright white light pop up out of
the canyon that I just come from I
looked over my my left shoulder and saw
a zipping light
oh
that zip through the the curves uh in
that bend mimicking my exact uh my Exact
Track and exactly the speed that I had
had
suddenly all I could see was a bright
light through all of my windows and at
that exact same time my car&#39;s power
steering and the engine&#39;s electrical
Association everything died completely
died
uh
when uh
when I exited the vehicle I rushed
towards the front of the car believing
there was someone pointing a floodlight
at us I had some words to say to that
man
I stepped through a thick field of white
plasma that encompassed encompassed a
spheroid craft
as they turned to go inspect my uh the
craft my wife opened the door and she
ran out towards the front of the
car and she was yelling Steve no
she was instantaneously locked in place
in a bright white field of plasma
as I looked at her
I thought to myself
it&#39;s okay she&#39;s a stasis lock that that
plasma enveloped her body with about six
inches
I heard a female voice call me State
felt like it was in my head it said she
is in stasis lock it was a confirmation
thank you Dr Drew
relieved that she was safe I started
approaching the craft for further
inspection
the craft and the car uh
the craft in the car were nose to nose
at a 90 degree formation if you looked
at it from a bird&#39;s eye view it&#39;d be in
an l-shape nose to nose
the craft was uh
there was a plasma field emitting
approximately 12 inches off for the
craft
inside this white plasma field the craft
seemed about Trump approximately 23 feet
long I stepped forward with my left hand
extended and slightly reaching out to it
the crafter responded to my movement
this startled me slightly but I took it
and stood still just in case by moving
back and pivoting the nose away from my
hand like a cat or a boxer and it felt
like a cat to me uh
okay sorry I lost my place the exterior
looked like uh polished black onyx
as I approached the craft I noticed
ambient temperature not hot or cold
uh I kind of leaned down and touched the
craft and as I swiped my hand up the
craft starboard side
also towards the front of the craft uh
it was as smooth as glass however
when I drew my hand back
towards me
it felt like shark skin or a cat&#39;s
tongue
that was followed by a reaction the
reaction followed my hand and uh
as I
oh it&#39;s slightly off here so I&#39;m gonna
have to do this with my hands just to
describe it for you as you can see here
in the uh the the picture I I put my
hand on the craft like this
and I kind of push my head forward I
can&#39;t do it here because of the mic but
I wanted to swipe my hand up and look at
it like I was planing a piece of wood uh
as I drew my hand back that&#39;s when I
felt that this this strange texture felt
like a tiger skin or a tiger a shark
skin or uh like I said uh a cat&#39;s tongue
as I drew my hand back pixels jumped off
the craft uh they were like micro
shavings I would call it they they
resembled graphene
or magnetite shavings and uh Nano sized
particles as I did that and as I swiped
up first I guess to get back to as I
swiped up the craft emitted a tiger
stripe Pat him up up the starboard side
of the craft as I&#39;ve Drew my hand
backwards the pixels popped up
and as I did the craft purred it
bellowed through my body I could feel it
resonate my body cavity and uh it was
very intense I felt like I was in
contact with a living creature
yes sir
um
the reaction uh okay I&#39;m already done
with this thank you
as I uh as I drew my hand back
a lattice work opened up underneath
there was a very vibrant colors coming
out of the craft the underskin this is a
very thin Nano layer and there was a
meshwork honeycomb Style
uh and it was like a lattice work that
was like a frame around this and beneath
that was uh well there were filaments
flowing
they looked like a neural network uh
there I tried to see any any uh
Universal bus system or any computer
systems as the Analyst job that I had I
saw none of this
uh as I drew the hand closer to myself
uh trying to peer through all these
bright Wicked beautiful lights that were
pinks blues and every light color you
could think of in the Spectrum I wasn&#39;t
able to see anything through it so as
I&#39;ve Drew my hand this way
I kind of pressed off the vehicle the
vehicle was stable I mean this thing was
locked in position it&#39;s not like Star
Wars when you jump off of something and
it moves this thing was solidly locked
in place solid I&#39;ve seen a shape right
here under my through my elbow
as I as I leaned my face down and I
could see up into the sky above my car
a mirage which was like a silhouette or
a heat foil on the road and uh the the
stars shimmered in a straight line in a
very long distance there was a curve so
it looks seemed to be curved either way
right when that Ripple hit in the sky
uh the Stars Then refix back into place
I realized I was looking at a cloaking
device on a very very large craft that
seemed to Encompass the whole desert
area that I was under
uh at that moment in time I then uh I
glanced and panned my view just to try
to get the you know fathom the
dimensions of this craft and I saw a
giant white bright white light uh
floating in the sky and it was a hangar
bay door opened uh
you couldn&#39;t see doors it was just a
bright white light
and it looked like a window floating
through the sky maybe even a portal
people might from a distance think hey
that&#39;s a portal but I obviously knew it
was a craft so this is a hangar bay door
and there was a female silhouette
standing there
at that moment in time I seemed that I
heard that same voice and it said very
clearly you were not supposed to see
that
that you weren&#39;t supposed to see it all
of a sudden
I began feeling a thud thud thud sound
uh this was a resonant frequency being
pulsed through my body
as I felt this
uh it increased in speed the the the the
it was very rapid you could see the same
type of thing in the movie Interstellar
very similar when he falls through the
black hole
too similar
too similar
uh
as these this thought resonated my body
I felt my molecular or my cells maybe
the quantum level of my body feel like
it was being resonated I felt like maybe
I&#39;m gonna be microwaved uh or something
to that nature either way I seen some
bands coming through I began lifting up
off the ground
my vehicle began lifting with me also as
this happened my body tipped back and I
could see the underbelly of The Craft
you&#39;re going to see that design right in
front of you
uh this the rectangular shape right in
the center there looked like a docking
socket for an electrical Port if you&#39;re
going to take a you know a big big uh uh
male end
um this would be the female recepting
receiving end for an electrical charger
to skip through that there were some
very very uh there&#39;s some highlighted uh
Parts here and as you can read them
there I&#39;m going to let you read that for
yourself just for time sake
however as this happened uh
instantaneously I queued in and I was
flat on my back
and I was staring up at the ceiling uh
and my vision queued into a very very
bright white light
my vision panned over and there was my
wife flat on her back on a table it was
smaller than the table I was laying on
slightly lowered and she still had the
same exact expression on her face like
she was screaming no however however she
was no longer stuck in the running
position she was flat
as I pinned a little a little more in
front of me to kind of gauge where I was
at and this all happened to milliseconds
guys this was whole crap um what&#39;s
happening so this is a very short
encounter here as I panned over I saw my
vehicle with the right the right uh
passenger tires and uh lifted up I saw
some people in some white suits fully
fully garmented masks with some
breathing apparatuses they were working
on the vehicle slightly next to that was
a strange blue rack that looked like it
could have been an automotive rack could
have had another purpose that was my
quick assumption as I as I
oh yes sir thank you sir
uh yes sir so uh after that had happened
uh I saw a female right next to me she
was taking some samples for me it was a
human female she had red hair
uh she had very fair skin uh and uh
after that moment I also as I panned
over I could see the window and the
desert behind me I realized we were not
in space I could see the desert floor I
could see the exact two rock formations
and one far off into in the distance so
this is pinpointed by by GPS coordinates
so uh after that uh I panned a little
more over and as I seen this open up uh
and the bay the bay door behind her open
or maybe just transparent and I could
see out uh I I also seen that craft
right here docked in the ship and that
came through me after trying to get
these schematics done on paper while
talking to Michael Scratch so thank you
sir this man went through PTSD with me
so thank you
great
yes thank you very much they&#39;re
obviously a great deal more to all these
accounts I&#39;m sorry to have to cut that
short but we&#39;re sort of at the past our
time we were going to wrap it up but I
will tell you that this is not a typical
the craft he was referring to are ours
that was Raytheon objects those are and
he said yes they are it&#39;s key Point
needs to be made absolutely they have
been used and simulated quote unquote
abductions in this case a very decorated
and heroic man was essentially tortured
by this this is a crime that must be
investigated and brought to Justice
quickly the next witness is DC long from
Fort Bragg he was involved in an
incidental
event many of these Witnesses at this
point were people who saw something they
shouldn&#39;t and there were reprisals and
things that happened it&#39;s a pattern the
ones that were read in for a number of
years like one man that I shared earlier
10 years in those operations those are
the ones right waiting for greater
protection for themselves before they
step forward but we have many of them so
with no further Ado I welcome my friend
D.C long
I promise mine&#39;s going to be much
quicker than some of these other guys
and this is the way I talk
so I apologize for that as well everyone
that I&#39;ve met here I would love to go
through every name I would love to go
through every situation what these
gentlemen have
we could spend years talking about it
just get into all the moments and
everything that meant the most to us and
unfortunately I have a very short amount
of time to do that
my military service began in 1997 and
it&#39;s stressed to 2013
until I was medically retired
injuries received in the combat jump
ironically enough the quick story that
I&#39;m going to tell you guys has virtually
nothing to do with my military career
until it got to the very end of the
story
long story short
my father
grew up
as a contractor
that was his entire life he could build
anything with his hands he could tear it
down and build it again for you
I stay away that and the only reason I
bring him up is because my father is how
I got tied into this story as a
government contractor on Fort Bragg he
met some people
he got friends with some people in the
upper echelons in the military the tip
of the spear the guys who didn&#39;t need
the Army Corps of Engineers permission
to build anything that they wanted
these people that I met I met when I was
13 years old we would go on hunts
together we would go on fishing trips
together riding their planes it would
take us all over the continental U.S
just to enjoy their time together people
that I thought were my friends but I
didn&#39;t know that they were in the
military until years after I had been in
myself
we meet up at 18th Airborne headquarters
by my father&#39;s request from me he asked
me if I could help him assist we didn&#39;t
know where the project was
we were told that we were going to be
met by an escort from the JFK Warfare
Center he shows up I recognize him as
one of my father&#39;s friends
I&#39;ve heard that the place we&#39;re going to
be going is range 19. I&#39;d never heard of
this place before hadn&#39;t since
they put us in a van no windows no
partition to the front
so we were joking what did you say
because we&#39;re taking you to Leavenworth
we show up at range 19. the only thing
that was directly in front of me
looked like a bunker 45 degree inches
from a concrete bunker covered in trash
looked like an actual dump
we open up there&#39;s another escort and
they&#39;re waiting on us
they take us to a freight elevator we
take the elevator down at that time we
were instructed keep your heads down
keep your eyes on the heels of the men
in front of you or you&#39;ll be fired upon
I&#39;ve heard plenty of messages of
military jargon people like to Jive each
other I didn&#39;t take it as a joke but I
knew enough to just do what he told me
to I didn&#39;t want to risk it
as soon as the the freight elevator open
the first thing that I could see were a
few personal contacts is to the right
and a large Hangar maybe twice three
times the size of the area that we&#39;re in
now
there was a monolithic slab directly in
front of me that was being held up by
nothing
the closer that I got to this lab I felt
an intense vibration inside of my body
I never felt anything like that before
in my life
never anything since but it left no
sound the loudest thing in that room was
the silence and the footfalls of the
people in front of him behind me
as I got closer my natural Southern
curiosity took over oh my shoes are
untied so I go down just to take a peek
and there&#39;s absolutely nothing up
underneath this monolithic slab that if
I had to estimate would be well over 100
tons absolutely nothing holding it up
you can see by the picture there&#39;s
another Boulder directly behind it it
was flat on the ground there were two
other people beside it I could only see
Hills and feet
to the right
you could see what looked like a boulder
in all three of these that I could tell
had this box on top that was black with
spiers that came off and I couldn&#39;t tell
where it was connected but it obviously
had something to do with the levitation
the one to the right was being spun by
the Personnel that you could see in the
picture
at this point from my knees the escort
needed me in the back said let&#39;s go we
follow on go downstairs to our appointed
place
to take measurements for an underground
farm facility for a live fire range
when it was all said and done
less than 15-20 minutes later we make
our way back to the surface through the
same Hangar that we had noticed the
monolithic slabs and the boulders and
there was absolutely nothing there
was no noise for anyone taking anything
out it was one flight down to our
appointed place but you could still hear
that there was nothing going on in the
facility that we were in
we make our way out we get back in the
van
and they take us back to 18 everyone
headquarters so we can retrieve our
telephones
our IDs
something was said to my father
and they retrieved
all of the notes that were taken
everything that he had that he recorded
from whenever we were downstairs they
took it from him I didn&#39;t think much of
it I go back upstairs help him wrap up
in the G5 war room
and it was at that time there was a
gentleman sitting at the desk everyone
was cleared out
and he had two pieces of paper said I
need to sign you today in the I need you
to sign this NDA absolutely not you know
we didn&#39;t so much take it as a joke but
we just didn&#39;t feel like the things that
we had witnessed although I did realize
it was something that I never should
have seen in my life
we weren&#39;t going to say
didn&#39;t think anything of it
I leave I get a call the next day less
than 24 hours later hey man you need to
come down we&#39;re trying to go to work and
everything&#39;s locked up everything&#39;s gone
everything that my father had worked for
from the time that I was a child until I
became a Man became a soldier and the
company that had my name on it
everything was seized
absolutely everything was seized the
pencils that he would use to make bid
submittals to the Army Corps of
Engineers was even taken because it
contributed from the business
everything was taken I can&#39;t illustrate
that point enough
my father went from being a very humble
millionaire to absolutely broke bankrupt
and destitute in 24 hours
now I try to I wish I could tell you
more about how much I love this man not
just because I have his name not just
because he&#39;s my father but he was my
best friend he led me through every
battle when I came home to let me know
that it was okay to feel the things that
I felt
this man and I
we were always together the only thing
that could separate us was the
deployments and the uniform that I wore
when I got done with my fight I found my
father when I was scared I found my
father Etc
this man that was my best friend
looked me in the eye when I found him
again and said hey man do you think this
had something to do with range 19. the
police pardoned my language my father
looks at me and says don&#39;t you ever
that was the last time that I heard my
father&#39;s voice
in this life
that was the last time that we ever had
any peaceful interaction and that was as
peaceful as it got
shortly after
I continue on
and we had a jfx
any of my old paratroopers they know
what that is it&#39;s jump field training
exercise Battalion wide it&#39;s a big deal
there&#39;s only 12 men in my stick getting
ready to go out of the bird I&#39;m the
first man looking at the Horizon waiting
for the John Master to give me the
signal his hands raised I noticed at the
right side someone coming up to my
shoulder and it&#39;s one of the escorts one
of the men that I knew personally from
the time I was a child till I was a man
and a soldier
he hooks up he looks at me gives me a
wink I didn&#39;t think much of it to me
there was no danger at that point
green light goes off I get a hit in my
back and then something hits me in the
side of the face and it&#39;s a static line
the gentleman to my right the man that I
knew threw his static line
intentionally
and it snapped my neck
I go to fall out of the aircraft deploy
my combat Pack full oscillation the only
thing that I heard after that was the
sound of my body made when it broke
when I woke up a month later I was told
that I was not fit to be a ranger
it was not fit to be airborne it wasn&#39;t
fit to be a soldier my career was
effectively over
even throughout all this time I could
not reach out to my father he wouldn&#39;t
take my calls he was homeless I didn&#39;t
know I just thought he didn&#39;t want to
talk to me
eventually I ended up in the same
situation
this follows further down the road
to about two years ago whenever I
finally was saved by someone
who I didn&#39;t even deserve to hear the
sound of The Voice
I intentionally grown my hair past my
shoulders my beard down to my stomach
that was 135 pounds just because I was
hoping I could hide
I was hoping I could get away from what
put me in that position to begin with
I get a phone call
it&#39;s two years ago
we found daddy he&#39;s in the hospital
I go down to see my father
he couldn&#39;t speak
the man that was 6&#39;4 240 pounds a
superhero in my eyes not just because he
was my daddy because he was a tough son
of a [ __ ]
he was laying in a hospital bed 98
pounds
when the people who I encountered after
the fact that had actually spent time
excuse me and got my father out of his
homeless situation to help him get back
on his feet to give him the drive to get
back to doing the only thing that he
knew how to do was to be a government
contractor
they put him back in contact with some
of the people that he thought could help
him
I can&#39;t illustrate this fact enough
in the time span of three months my
father went from 6-4 to 40 to 98 pounds
dying in a hospital room and he couldn&#39;t
even speak because the chemo was burning
his lips
I told him I love you
don&#39;t worry about us we&#39;re Square
I&#39;m going to make you proud
for Dr Greer and I came in contact with
each other and I&#39;m almost done
I wrote my story
and I entitled it I&#39;m afraid to say
and people have asked me why did you
wait so long it&#39;s obvious why we waited
so long to send it
nobody knows this my family doesn&#39;t know
this Dr Greer obviously doesn&#39;t know
this
when I sent that I was planning on
taking my life
because they took every damn thing from
me I could handle this in my career I
was willing to die for my country I was
hoping like hell I would somehow I
survived
and then they try to take me again they
can have all that I knew that when I put
these around my neck
but my intention was to take my own life
because I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore
I heard this man&#39;s that spins words with
Sean Ryan if good men do nothing then
evil men will prevail
I am damn tired of doing nothing
this is the absolute last thing that I&#39;m
going to say to you
I was trained to never fight excuse me I
was trained to fight never give up never
stop as long as you had a breath on your
body I gave my breath away
the people in this room everyone that
I&#39;ve had the the Blessed opportunity to
spend time with
I&#39;ve heard you say that we&#39;re Brave that
we&#39;re heroes and It embarrasses me
because I personally felt like I don&#39;t
deserve to be in the room with all of
you Heroes because I would not have the
words in the breath that come from my
body if it wasn&#39;t for the strength that
you give me when you shake my hand when
you hug my neck thank you so much
Godspeed
thank you
so I&#39;d like to introduce and thank you
very much again these I to men are
courageous and um I I it&#39;s very
emotional
and it should be
should be
I&#39;d like to introduce Eric Hecker he&#39;s a
Raytheon contractor based for about a
year at the South Pole he and it was
involved in a neutrino light array he
has an enormous amount of information
but in the interest of time we&#39;ll be
brief thank you Mr Hecker
hello everybody ladies gentlemen members
of the press I&#39;m very happy that you&#39;re
giving me this attention and this
information attention because it needs
to get out to the world I will start
since we have to be brief I have already
given all pertinent information and
supporting documentation to the Senate
intelligence committee and arrow they
informed me that all of my information
will be recorded for public record and
shared with Congress it is that
important
in 2010 I was selected to go down to the
South Pole station in Antarctica for an
entire year by Raytheon polar Services
as an employee of a third party
contractor for the National Science
Foundation I function in a dual role
capacity as a Tradesman and a
firefighter my responsibilities required
me to be more informed than most of my
crew and offered me complete access to
the facilities
what I learned from this unique
experience needs to be shared with the
entire world the technology at the South
Pole station certainly can do what it is
presented as its primary purposes and
unfortunately much more
the Ice Cube neutrino detector is
presented as a passive listening device
for the purposes of the science as
presented but I&#39;m going to skip right
through the chase folks I have provided
documentation that proves that the
5160 what they call Doms that are
embedded in the ice can actually
transmit at 2047 volts each
that gives us a long list of things to
consider it is effectively a
multi-faceted directed energy weapons
platform that I will list rapidly a few
things that it can do
vehicle detection we&#39;re learning that
these off-world Craft on Worldcraft ours
or other nations are also emitting
neutrinos so this makes the South Pole
station effectively an air traffic
control station for this new level of
equipment that nobody&#39;s discussing
in addition to the ability to detect
neutrinos and the Exotic vehicles
I&#39;ve provided documentation that shows
that this is also a system for faster
than light Communications in the past
Gary McKinnon has hacked NASA found the
off-world fleet the list of captains and
it&#39;s apparent that if we have faster
than light vehicles moving throughout
the system we&#39;re going to need faster
than light Communications this is that
facility
unfortunately I have other bad news
the season that I was there 2010 to 2011
we converted from construction to
operations and maintenance in both the
elevated station and the detector array
unfortunately when they first fired it
up
that was when we had the earthquakes in
Christchurch New Zealand there&#39;s two
incidental shots before they were able
to Target it correctly this is an
earthquake generating device as well
this is the weapons of war that we have
to deal with now and what raytheon&#39;s
hiding
there&#39;s an elf system at the South Pole
station when I was arrived I was told it
was off dismantled and completely
defunct in my work I will rapidly just
tell you I had to figure out the
circuitry for certain other repairs and
I found that this system is in fact
completely energized up and running and
being utilized with the other systems
for nefarious purposes as well
the atmospheric research Observatory is
uh
in what we call the Clean Air sector I
witnessed myself a very powerful green
laser shooting out of the top of this
facility into the cosmos
this I believe is a secondary form of
long-range Communications and or a
defense system
I am not saying that we need to be
scared of anything that&#39;s out there but
please understand the military
industrial complex is happy to invest
all of your money in alleviating their
fears
a question of power comes into play for
all of these facilities that are present
I assure you I knew what was going on I
knew the load demands of the facility
and all of these new items exceed the
demand for the systems that I was
presented
by doing due diligence and research I
believe there is either a secondary
power supply there that is either
nuclear that uh was there prior to the
start of the Antarctic treaty which
prohibits such things and or that there
is some sort of exotic power supply
system there that just is not in the
verbiage of the treaty so it negates the
responsibility to the parties involved
I think that pretty much covers it for
time if anybody if anybody wants to find
out more I have a website where all this
information is at for brevity I&#39;ll wrap
it up but you can go to deciphering.tv
I&#39;ve documented all this stuff and
information is available
we are running a little over and I
apologize but I think it&#39;s worth hearing
as much as we can from these very
courageous uh men one of the things I if
I had time I would run through we can go
through very quickly I think people in
the military and in Congress and the
American people know that need to know
the difference between the man-made
Advanced Technologies and how they look
and the Extraterrestrial Vehicles we&#39;re
going to run through a side by side you
can look and see
E.T one on the left seamless it is
actually created in a Material Science
and Technology we don&#39;t have time to go
into but we understand that versus the
man-made ones that have components Parts
wires and what have you next
and again
next
and again
and then you hear on the right that is
the Norton Air Force Base 1988 Air Show
classified
we have a witness who was in there and
these on the right are man-made they
were late Mercury era of 59 through
early 60s in their construction because
we had mastered gravity control in
October 1954.
so these have been in the solar system
by the time my uncle who&#39;s Northrop
Grumman had worked on the lunar module
out on Long Island to put Neil Armstrong
on the Moon next
this is again an ET vehicle
on the left
one with struts Parts pipes and often
humming a transmission sort of
Transformer sound on the right
next
and again won this extraterrestrial and
a vague copycat that&#39;s man-made next
and again
and again
next
now the one on the right
this is a little bit ton pack it takes a
couple hours I&#39;ll go through it quickly
you can look up the Cash Land room case
back in 1980 outside Houston and Texas
the one on the right is actually an at
craft it was being on they were unable
to figure out how to get its energy
system to work they I think rather
foolishly put a nuclear energy system on
it it malfunctioned and as it did so it
radiated innocent people in their
vehicle underneath it it later was
escorted by kilos to a base west of
there the man who debriefed the four
human Pilots of this and to brief them
we know and we have his testimony he&#39;s
Air Force office of special
Investigations out of Kirkland Air Force
Base so the cashlander case
involves civilian injuries they tried to
sue the government the government denied
they had any knowledge of it but the
constitutional government of the United
States doesn&#39;t know this this is the big
problem next
and this I want to just play this for a
moment here we&#39;re in Washington here is
an esteemed senator
from Hawaii and listen to what he said
in the 1980s
a shadowy government with his own Air
Force
his own Navy
his own fundraising mechanism
and the ability to pursue his own ideas
of the national interests
free from all checks and balances
and free from the law itself
free from all checks and balances and
free from the law itself
now the media often wants to portray
this issue conspiracy people and of
course at this point if you disagree
with someone anywhere you just call them
as conspiracy theorist okay
this man knew what he was talking about
a shot
oops
so he absolutely knew what was going on
with this he was denied access not just
on the Iran Contra issue but on this
specific issue and how do we know that
we have an attorney
Derek Garcia here he is now heading up
the disclosure project legal defense
fund and we have as of about two hours
ago
90 plus attorneys and legal
professionals to represent disclosure
project Witnesses and to ex to pursue
racketeering influence corrupt
organization lawsuits against various
corporations and individuals that are
liable
the United States Congress and President
need to act but we will act pending
their action I&#39;d like to then welcome
Derek Garcia to the podium
good afternoon
my name is Derek Garcia I&#39;m a civil
rights attorney from New Mexico I&#39;ve
been in practice for 13 years
I&#39;m admitted to practice in the district
of New Mexico the federal district the
United States court of appeals for the
10th circuit as well as the U.S Supreme
Court
I&#39;m joined in the audience by my
colleague and attorney Paige Fox from
Illinois and numerous attorneys who have
now joined our legal team Nationwide
and internationally
we are dedicated to ending Decades of
UFO secrecy and releasing vital
Technologies which will bring an end to
our current environmental and energy
crisis
on May 23rd we announced the creation of
the disclosure project legal team over
Dr Greer&#39;s YouTube channel since our
initial announcement we now have over 90
legally Affiliated individuals
different practice areas and expertise
paralegals law students law clerks
members of law enforcement and criminal
investigators legal professionals from
over 23 States and nearly all relevant
jurisdictions and a growing list of
preeminent in attorneys internationally
we continue to make the call for pro
bono attorneys
all volunteer at this point and legal
professionals
and add new members of the disclosure
project legal team on an hourly basis
we have assembled a one-of-kind and
strictly non-partisan
Volunteer Legal team for the purpose of
moving disclosure forward once and for
all
our goals are to legitimize the
essentially tapos and promote public
awareness as to the numerous related
constitutional and legal implications on
this issue
we wish to support the constitutional
government in regaining full operational
control
over these secret illegal
black budget Beyond black budget
projects
and we will gain control
over this issue for the first time since
President Eisenhower
we will see truth about propulsion and
Advanced Energy Technologies capable of
solving world hunger poverty and the
energy crisis
we will seek Justice for those who have
been harmed
by non-disclosure and Technology seizure
through filing civil Rico actions Bivens
claims and numerous and multiple legal
theories
aimed at getting to the ultimate truth
on this issue
the competence under oath testimony
already developed by the disclosure
product team Dr Greer and these
courageous Witnesses
and represented in the disclosure
project intelligent art intelligence
archives developed over 30 years
of Dr Greer&#39;s work
may also be used in Criminal
prosecutions
by United States attorneys or criminal
prosecutors across the globe
indictments on the numerous Rico crimes
which have been committed on this issue
with the aim of keeping the issue buried
just a small sample and I know we&#39;re
short for time
of the crimes that are directly related
to this issue disclosure project
Witnesses have and gathered intelligence
has established the following Major
Crimes
treason against the United States of
America
murder
mass murder
torture
kidnapping and abduction
embezzlement of government funds
embezzlement of private funds
bank fraud money laundering illegal
surveillance insubordination and
Insurrection against the United States
false imprisonment
witness and whistleblower intimidation
theft of intellectual property
trespassing burglary
framing of innocent people government
corruption blackmail bribery and illegal
use of the government and Military
property
and many many more crimes
we hoped to support the civilian
government criminal prosecutors any
evidence that we develop and continue to
develop
can be used for that purpose
my personal experience in coming to this
issue was as a young senator
excuse me a young intern for senators
bingaman and dominici in the summer of
2001.
on Capitol Hill in Washington DC
the disclosure project press conference
had just taken place on May 9th of 2001.
during my internship I distributed
numerous copies of the disclosure
project executive summary and briefing
document and other written materials to
various members of Congress and their
staff including direct submissions to
Leading members of the senate in the
underground subway system
waiting in the hallway of the heart
Senate Office Building I encountered
hero of our country Senator Daniel
anyway
walking back from his office
I gave Senator a copy the senator a copy
of the disclosure project executive
summary and asked him if he had heard
about the disclosure project
and what he thought of UFO&#39;s
extraterrestrial intelligence and the
possibility of these intelligences
actually visiting Earth
Senator anyway responded by hand
signaling me to follow him back to his
private office
he shut the door of his private office
Senator Anyway said he dealt with the
UFO issue extensively while he was
chairman of the Senate intelligence
Committee in 1976.
Senator anyway
confirmed that he had seen the May 9
2001 disclosure project press conference
here at the national Press Club and that
the testimony provided by those
courageous Witnesses at the time was
substantially accurate and correct
based on his direct experience and
briefings on this subject
Senator anyway confirmed that many UFOs
and projects related to such represented
genuine extraterrestrial vehicles
and that this issue as portrayed by Dr
Stephen Greer and the 2001 disclosure
project Witnesses was real genuine and
absolutely not a hoax
I asked Senator anyway if it was true
that a secret unacknowledged entity or
control group operating illegally inside
the United States government
internationally and or within the
private sector among defense contractors
and corporations had Direct operational
control of the UFO ETV issue
Senator anyway confirmed his statement
that there exists a shadowy government
with its own Air Force its own Navy its
own fundraising mechanism and the
ability to pursue its own ideas of the
national interest free from all checks
and balances and free from the law
itself
as stated during the Iran Contra
hearings in 1987.
I asked whether he was exaggerating
when he made the statement
I asked if perhaps he was speaking of
another government
I asked
many questions that day but he looked to
me and he told me directly
that he was not exaggerating
that the illegal Shadow government
did exist
at the time he made his statement in
1987.
and continued to exist in 2001 during
our conversation
and that the entity had thus far escapes
complete scrutiny control and oversight
by the legally authorized and
constitutional government of the United
States
further corroborating documents and
details to my personal testimony on this
issue is available in a signed affidavit
that I have executed concerning what uh
Dr Senator anyway told me directly for
members in the media I can definitely
get you a electronic copy we encourage
you to uh join our legal team by
visiting uh our YouTube channel or the
disclosure.legal gmail.com and we thank
you and all those in our nation and
worldwide who have volunteered their
legal talents so far as we continue to
develop a strategy and approach that
will stand the test of time
show up suit up stand up for the future
of your country and for your world
thank you
thank you
so I would like to thank very sincerely
Mr Garcia for his work when he first
contacted me he was a 20 year old
student at Wesleyan now he&#39;s the age of
a couple of my daughters he&#39;s now an
attorney and we&#39;ve gone full cycle where
now he is stepping up with all these
other uh wonderful
attorneys and legal professionals to
represent what we were doing uh pro bono
since we were at present and unfunded
operation I would like to also just
quickly go through we&#39;re not going to
have time to go through everything here
but there is a history of hearings on
this subject going back many decades you
know we have blue book Robertson report
the Ford Gerald Ford hearings the Condon
report and Etc these have all been
unfortunately submarined and corrupted
by influences that it prevented the
truth of this coming out we have to be
very careful
because Eisenhower said only an informed
citizenry
can prevent the loss of our freedoms and
democracy I would like to acknowledge
how important let&#39;s go through these
signatures the 16 members next of the
Senate who have written for the
Pentagon the pick up its pace and
further fund the investigations but they
have to have Watchdog external folks
looking at that that&#39;s what the
disclosure project has to do he also uh
chairs and co-chair of the Senate
intelligence committee have written to
arrow with concerns about the feedback
there are people I know who have been
through the Aero office and the skiff
and they have contacted me explicitly
saying that some of their their
information is not getting back to the
members properly this cannot happen the
Congress has passed the law the Pentagon
and this office must comply and the
people of the United States must insist
that they comply with the law that has
been passed next
we won&#39;t have time to go into this in
depth I just want to mention
I want to be extremely careful what I&#39;m
about to say because it will be
misconstrued by various folks out there
there are civilizations extremely
Advanced that are concerned with what
we&#39;re doing this station at the South
Pole is a much later version of a man
that I worked with for a number of years
in the 90s who invented the neutrino
light detector system on the satellites
up in space
he knew then that these were being used
and this was in the 70s to track Target
and Destroy extraterrestrial Assets in
space and also around the earth now
these civilizations given their
extremely Advanced state had they wished
to punch back
they would have
however they are inordinately peaceful
they are organized in a group and we
need to come forward as a people instead
of looking at everything as a military
threat and see that there&#39;s an
opportunity here and there has to be
diplomacy and Science and disclosure of
the truth in order to avoid a
catastrophe my understanding is the
technologies that are in these covert
programs have become so Advanced that at
some point they could be a threat to
these other worlds as such it puts our
entire planet at risk because of the
unchecked power and Technology of the
illegal secret government projects this
is a much Graver national security
threat than China Russia Iran or
anything the news media is currently
covering
next
I want to give you a call to action all
of you listening the citizens of the
world not just the United States
if you know someone who is a government
contractor a government employee
military what have you who has
information on this please have them
contact us at this email address
please write your members of Congress we
live in a democracy still
you should write to your two senators
and your representative and the
president of the United States
expressing your concern and calling for
open hearings
we need to network with our friends and
families and get them to support this
effort you need if you can to contribute
to our effort I am retired as a doctor
so you know
I can&#39;t fund everything at this point
like I had if you can assist with the
energy research lab that we are
proposing in the Lost Century you&#39;ll see
that then please contact us we are have
a 50 million dollar funding need to
stand up a open source energy lab what
does that mean we were developed these
Zero Point Energy Technologies and they
would be released free of charge open
source to the entire world so we can
quickly solve the environmental and
poverty problems we are facing
foreign
acquire
or develop a zero point Quantum vacuum
system no later than 2026.
that&#39;s very fast
so we need your help if you&#39;re a
scientist who knows these Technologies
or in other capacities can help us
hoping we get funding we will call on
you to be part of this multi-centered
lab in other words we would have this
lab streamed continuously all
breakthroughs would be blockchain
distributed in real time and there would
be other Affiliated labs around the
world working on this so it could not be
invaded and shut down in one place
next
and when wrapping up I&#39;d like to share
something that I learned from Colonel
Philip Corso prior to his death when I
was
involved and he came forward as you all
know wrote the day after Roswell he had
been involved in some of the technology
transfer and he had an experience out at
the White Sands Missile Range back in
the 50s pretty sure it was 1956 but I
don&#39;t want to be I don&#39;t quote me on
that and he was par he was a colonel he
was involved in these projects there was
an E.T craft that came in daytime and
came down over the range he went out
there
with a couple of his guys
and this craft it would be
three-dimensional and then vanish like a
heat wave like Stephen digna explained
and then back again finally it stayed
there was an E.T that emerged
extraterrestrial biological entity
and he said the ET was communicating
please don&#39;t hit us with these radar can
you get these radar systems out you know
and was asking because they were
operational of course at that time they
were operational at Roswell
and being he missed being a brass young
you know a Air Force Colonel and he says
what&#39;s in it for me
and the ET says a new world if you can
take it
now I was one
now you know I have uh 12 grandchildren
what kind of world are we going to leave
them if we don&#39;t fix this problem
because it involves peace and we have to
work towards contact that is in a
peaceful Paradigm we have launched a
very controversial project as I get
attacked the most for the ce5 or close
encounter the fifth kind a contact
program as sort of an experimental
community-based Outreach to these
civilizations we have had a number of
extraordinary contact experiences this
is sort of a prototype that the French
government during the presidency of
Sarkozy asked us to demonstrate and we
set an operation in France that was
protected where we did have events take
place I think we have to begin to ask
what can we do as a civilian government
where we don&#39;t try to militarize and
weaponize everything we don&#39;t understand
because here&#39;s the problem if you&#39;re a
hammer
the whole world&#39;s a nail
and so we have to get this disclosed
properly so that our
brighter scientists
are academics our political leadership
and our diplomats and the citizens can
take the lead on this issue rather than
an illegal and clandestine operation
that is a threat to National and World
security thank you for your attention
I I am told we have to be out of here at
five we&#39;ve gone over about an hour I
apologize for that but if there are any
members of the press here that have a
question you can ask them and we&#39;ll be
happy to answer them briefly
any members of the media yes
he&#39;s asking about our safety look if I
was worried about my safety I would have
never walked on on down this path
I have been threatened and we&#39;ve had
some losses on our team I&#39;ve had a few
people over the years that worked with
me who have been killed it&#39;s it&#39;s
difficult
but yeah
I just think
the mission of what we&#39;re trying to do
is more important than one life mine so
you can&#39;t worry about that we do have
good security now and I think that there
are people frankly in these very
classified projects who do want to help
us and protect us and they have been
since about 1998 and that&#39;s pretty much
or is there another
thank you
oh you&#39;re welcome
my name is
yes he&#39;s asking about my comment about
gravity control being accomplished in
October 1954 a member of my team for
many years was the top scientists at the
Naval Research Labs here in Washington
so one of the major department defense
Labs he was
one step down after the director of the
lab and uh he had been in a vault where
he saw the document and skiff and saw
the documentation that we had mastered
gravity control meaning that we had had
experimentation with it earlier but
mastering it so it was stable occurred
in October of 1954. his name was is
Richard fosh f-o-c-h he has deceased uh
but he he worked with us for many years
and was very much in the inside he also
introduced to me to some folks down near
the Redstone Arsenal and a man who is
under contract with atnt but he actually
is working through for the CIA and he
has developed these Technologies also
beginning in the 70s and I&#39;ve been at
this man&#39;s skiff he&#39;s been at my home
when he was going to develop on these
systems for us some thugs went down and
threatened he and his wife&#39;s a lot his
life so you know he had to back down at
that time we didn&#39;t have a momentum to
in a way to secure his safety so yes I
mean we do know that this goes back a
long time I know that we have Senator
John Warner&#39;s son here who his father
was involved with this committee it&#39;s
the majority
joint intelligence committee along with
George H.W bush who is the one who told
Clinton to back down off of looking into
this and I was very involved with that
there&#39;s a long story here we&#39;d be here
all night but we do know that Paul
Mellon the grandfather of John Warner IV
who is here today went over and
retrieved a German disc at the end of
World War II that was their prototype to
develop a a so-called anti-gravity
electromagnetic gravitic system but it
wasn&#39;t fully operational by the time the
war ended but that became something that
then was pursued later through
operations that were highly classified
in the United States and in the very
black
Aerospace world and we have this very
well documented by the way this was a
great deal of History here of the United
States and after World War II that we
don&#39;t the public doesn&#39;t know about but
but it&#39;ll come out other questions
yes ma&#39;am
for your bravery and covering what many
of us journalists in the truth movement
see is bringing the alarm for the most
critical topic on the planet right now
and you know we&#39;ve really learned that
we the people that they that we&#39;ve been
funding unbeknownst to us with our
taxpayer money these Black Operations
what can you tell us that we can do I
know you had a call to action but for
not just the journalists but everyone in
this room and everyone tuning in what
can we do to help support and really
flip this movement right now and help
save you know our planet Humanity have
access to the free energy that we have
been funding as well what we need
networking support we need people like
Sean Ryan who had me on his show and got
this message out to so many uh members
of the military Delta Force guys Navy
Seals others uh and and are now coming
forward we need significant funding
because it&#39;s an unfunded project
everyone who works with it is a
volunteer has been for 33 years
um but I also think that we need people
to network with friends and it needs to
be a Grassroots movement of the people
and people need to also take the action
I mentioned with their members of
Congress most importantly I think
everyone who knows the truth about this
needs to work night and day this is what
I did I basically gave up about 12
million dollars in earnings as a doctor
to do this but my view of it is that we
need people who understand what&#39;s at
stake and walk the talk it&#39;s not you can
need to go beyond just gas up and we
need action and I think the timeline for
it is now this is all emerging I just
heard from a very important figure in
Australia this morning he said the
defense sector there is following this
there are multiple people there kind of
come forward there&#39;s a big asset base
there in their Pine Gap and the members
of the Australian Senate are also open
to pursuing this so this needs to be a
worldwide effort not just United States
foreign
yes all of this is available
um
assuming we can get it to you that can
be emailed to you the redacted one
obviously the unredacted one is very
sensitive I am not going to disclose the
names of the hundreds of men and women
who want to not be disclosed publicly
now it&#39;s very courageous of these guys
to do it I know what it&#39;s like to be put
in the crosshairs of this subject and
ridiculed and defamed for 30 years so
these are very courageous people but
that list you can actually receive
as well as the entire facilities list
now the facilities list just gives you a
location doesn&#39;t tell you quite
everything that&#39;s there gives you a
little bit of a little blurb but it&#39;s
what we can provide at this point again
remember any requests like this are
being fulfilled by volunteers who have
day jobs and lives so be patient with
your requests and please communicate
that to our staff our email address that
I provided
yes other
yes
the illegal secret government well look
I know a number I
actually met with a few of them over the
years
um
he&#39;s deceased now General stubble Vine
offered me two billion dollars not to do
what I&#39;m doing in 1992. there were
witnesses to this
the level of corruption is almost
unbelievable we do have a man who&#39;s this
former chairman of a major Fortune 100
company who wants to come forward but he
and his family have been threatened in
the last month
so I&#39;ve had these conversations and this
man by the way confirms that Corporation
has free energy
he regrets what he&#39;s done he is retired
and he would love to see this come
forward for his children and
grandchildren he&#39;s
a decade or more older than me so I I I
at this point the ones who are not
wanting to be named I don&#39;t name
uh however if there&#39;s a proper
investigation out of the White House in
the Senate uh we will name them and if
they need to be subpoenaed they will be
subpoenaed
um but I mean this is a process where I
don&#39;t want to burn Bridges to people who
are actually sympathetic to what we&#39;re
doing but we have not provided enough
protection including immunity from
seizure of their assets this gentleman
has several hundred million dollars he
doesn&#39;t want to have that confiscated he
doesn&#39;t want his family threatened and
so it&#39;s complicated issue it&#39;s nothing
it&#39;s blurting out a bunch of names
other folks who have been named on this
group or Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who is
still living
and and other folks so I think he was
Director of National Security Agency
deputy director CIA moved over to
science applications international
corporation we know which corporations
are involved we know where many of their
plants are and bases are and I think
those have to be put under the control
of the president and the Congress
immediately and I think that&#39;s more
important than you know the
personalities involved but ultimately it
does come down to people all of it comes
down to people and I think we need to
have a number of those folks who are now
out of their positions out of the
c-suite step forward but we need so I
keep emphasizing this clear protections
for them because this is no laughing
matter
uh I mean when I when you&#39;ve heard
what happens and these many of these for
people who incidentally came across this
and it destroyed their lives imagine if
you were read in for 20 years
I mean there are wet works of kill teams
that will be deployed and so this is
very very serious it needs to be taken
seriously and I will not be you know too
Cavalier about what I&#39;m going to require
for those folks who do want to do the
right thing now the ones who don&#39;t want
to do the right thing I said this we put
a clock on it
the Congress and the president puts a
clock on that and then at that point
they get prosecuted or by any means
necessary this gets resolved
yeah Dr Guerrera can you give any I&#39;m
over here I see yeah Gavin McLennan can
you give any clarification on the Van
Allen radiation belts there&#39;s a lot of
dissension about the Van Allen radiation
belts give any clarification on
Transportation through them
no I don&#39;t have any specific information
on on that issue
I do know that these technologies that
we&#39;re talking about would have no
problem going through
frankly solid matter ocean
Etc
is there another member of the media
president wait for the mic please
thank you very much
Dr Greer can you tell us more about the
program life forms that are involved in
the so-called abduction phenomenon
please thank you yes were those you know
they&#39;ve been around for a very long time
as you know from our Air Force office of
special investigations witness who
appeared and unacknowledged that
document in 2017
in the early days and I actually have
met with people on the Tactical teams
from the good old days where they would
have people who are short looked
whatever and it was stagecraft like a
Disney set and they would be on these
electrogravidic devices using various
chemicals and what have you to abduct
people the purpose for that is to
present a false threat from space this
is what Werner Von Brown who invented
the rocket with or for the Germany in
World War II told Carol rosin on his
deathbed and begged her to try to
prevent the weaponization of space and
Etc he knew this was going on in 1974
when he made that warning and you can
see her testimony in the disclosure
project
website on YouTube however it evolved
from that point to where they have very
sophisticated robotic objects and beings
that look exactly like a gray or this or
that and I&#39;ve met with multiple people
who have constructed them operated them
or been victims of them who are military
Mr digna was actually abducted and taken
into this craft through technologies
that sounds like science fiction but
remember what Ben Rich told my friend
James Goodall who is here is an
aerospace historian right before he died
and he said
anything you can imagine that they&#39;ve
done on Star Trek is out in the desert
he&#39;s not talking about Area 51 he&#39;s
talking about the Lockheed assets and
we&#39;ve already done it we have it it
exists and we&#39;ve either used it or
decided not to use it he also wrote the
reply to one of his friends that Mr
schrat obtained where the man said do
you think UFOs exist and are they
extraterrestrial or ours he said they
are both and that is from the director
and the head of Lockheed Skunk Works Ben
Rich legendary so I always tell people
we have all this in the archive please
don&#39;t just take my word for it I&#39;m a
never had a clearance never been the
government I&#39;m an emergency doctor doing
this as a to help the future of our
planet but we have all the information
that proves every bit of this and under
oath these courageous men and hundreds
of others will tell the truth
yes
yes
I couldn&#39;t understand the question the
U.S sovereignty is it is it threatened
because of the Shadow government and
other forces I will tell you that
effectively
the constitutional government of the
United States at least in this area has
been nullified since about the late
1950s and we have tracked this
it&#39;s a huge problem Center anyway knew
it now in other regards it&#39;s business as
usual but remember this organization is
transnational it operates globally with
alacrity as I mentioned and so this is
not just a U.S problem it&#39;s a global
problem but the center of gravity of it
is here in the United States
other questions before we need to move
Cassandra Joan Butler from
Pathfinder news Dr gear thank you this
has been mind-blowing but uh are there
international groups such as yourself
similar to disclosure project across the
globe others networking with other like
Minds well yes we have people involved
with what we&#39;re doing in various other
countries including Russia
in their space program and other places
we recently obtained the testimony of a
Russian general that back in the Soviet
era where an extraterrestrial vehicle
and beans put some of the people at a
intercontinental ballistic missile site
kind of in stasis so they could go in
and fixed an overheating missile that
wasn&#39;t being detected that could have
blown up and could have triggered World
War III now I will tell you there are a
number incidences that involve nuclear
sites weapon storage areas Etc where
there have been and power plants where
there have been ET craft because there
is there&#39;s energy being given off from
those systems that are beyond the
electromagnetic pulse spectrum that Dr
zohari Who was here this weekend who&#39;s a
physicist described in in the scalar
range so I think that the interstellar
civilizations these extraterrestrial
civilizations have a profound concern
because those could be a threat to them
those is energy for us but they know
it&#39;s a threat existential to the earth I
actually honestly believe these
civilizations regard the Earth as
precious that humanity is filled with
promise and I think they have been
trying to warn us and keep us from going
down the path of either geophysical
disaster or or that that would be using
these sort of weapons the most dangerous
weapons are unacknowledged they&#39;re not
the nuclear ones they&#39;re the ones that
Mr Hecker is talking about and others
and uh we have a great deal of
information on that I have folks who&#39;ve
worked for the NSA and also Raytheon who
have used some of those in horrific ways
to trigger deliberately
earthquakes and other problems so this
is something that is very serious and it
has to be gotten under control and I say
that these projects need to get under
supervision and control by some sane
folks who aren&#39;t sociopaths it has to
happen fairly quickly at this point yes
hello
Oh
Billy Carson Forbidden Knowledge TV hey
there coming in line
with regards to the civilian Rico
uh can we foresee if this process is
successful any potential prison time for
any of these corporate execs that are
behind this
look an eye for an eye leaves the whole
world blind I think what we want to do
first is to gain their cooperation with
the effort we hope we can exert enough
pressure both through what we&#39;re doing
as civilians who are civilian Rico and
other actions as well as what&#39;s
happening in the Congress that that gets
resolved what you don&#39;t want to do is
just throw down with folks who have
Technologies and I will tell you this is
sensitive but when I was briefing
Admiral Tom Wilson who is the head of
intelligence showing Chiefs of Staff in
1997 26 years ago I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s
been that long
um he at the end I asked you know we
need your help to get these projects
under proper control
and he says well does the Secretary of
Defense I can&#39;t do it without his and
and he&#39;s not giving me that order he
says what about the president I said no
the president has been waived off this
is Bill Clinton and I know exactly how
that happened
uh so
because I was very involved with
Lawrence Rockefeller and all the Clinton
uh issue so the question becomes very
quickly and he said to me how would we
take on
a group who have Technologies A Thousand
Years beyond what I know we have which
is the best thing I can deploy is a B2
stealth bomber so this is a very serious
issue strategically how do you approach
this now the constitutional government
of the United States has the rule of law
and I think if it&#39;s disclosed properly
the support of the populace and the
people and the rank and file and I want
to point out
virtually all the disclosure project
Witnesses except some of these few that
are very much at the top were just
obeying orders they were at a site they
were Delta Force or a Navy SEAL or what
have you they didn&#39;t know that the
management of it had escaped
constitutional control and I didn&#39;t know
that until 1993 and that was of course
my coming of age when I realized my God
the president the director of the CIA
are being denied access and then
multiple senators and congressmen that I
met with privately so I think that what
we want to do is resolve this in a
peaceful legal fashion and we do not
want to just go straight to you know
Defcon one right we don&#39;t want to go to
to that so I I think we need to do that
in the next six months however the
information I have I don&#39;t want to go
further than that is that a clock has
been placed on this it must be resolved
within this year early next year
and then things are going to deteriorate
significantly
you know I don&#39;t want to really go into
I mean let them speak for themselves
when I take meetings I take them if
they&#39;re confidential they&#39;re
confidential
I&#39;m not important in this it&#39;s not
supporting me you know you know I&#39;m 68 I
was 34 when I started on this path of
double my age I&#39;m not going to live
another 30 years probably so you know my
point is I want to be a means to get the
intelligence the information put the
Coalition together to move this forward
and I think it&#39;s going to need uh but
you know the members of Congress who
come forward about this already such as
Congressman Tim burchett of Tennessee
who has called for these open hearings
he&#39;s on the house government reform and
oversight committee there are many
members of Congress who are Awakening to
this problem the issue is they&#39;re moving
much too slowly you need to contact
these members of Congress and also the
White House and the Office of the
President and say this needs to be dealt
with expeditiously because they now have
in their possession the entire
disclosure project intelligence archive
and what I have to say about that is no
more excuses no more excuses they have
everything they need
Dr Greer as a special operations back
over here you&#39;re left
there we go there you are yeah first and
foremost thank you for everything you do
we we appreciate that
um I&#39;m a my name is Justin Wilson I&#39;m a
former Special Operations operator and I
currently own a media company called
praetorian uh two-part question the
first one being is there no hostility
from another species because there&#39;s a
higher governing species or is it just
the fact that
there there is no hostility whatsoever
how can we be sure that first question
everybody who I know who has dealt
directly with those beans have told me
our own experience and that is they are
completely non-hostile they have been
portrayed as such because how do you
reunite the world around a military
response you create a false alien threat
is what Werner Von Brown warned about
and we are very much at that point
unfortunately so I think that calmer
Minds need to Prevail but there is no
evidence they are hostile now let me
make one other point as I said one time
to a general I&#39;ll see who it is because
that
if they were hostile and given the
galactically
foolish things we have done targeting
them striking them now these systems
that are faster and speed of light
moving out in the space the Technologies
they have
in a fraction of a second could shut
down all those systems
and everything else they have not why
have they not done that because they are
essentially very peaceful highly
organized socially evolved
psychologically and emotionally evolved
civilizations one other point common
sense if you possess those sort of
weapons and you&#39;re still of the
consciousness of violence
you&#39;re going to blow yourself up
uh or some nearby planet with you
because we&#39;re not talking about let&#39;s
forget science fiction you&#39;re not
talking about boom boom with a laser
beam right or a kinetic missile
or even a thermonuclear missile you&#39;re
talking about it affect the fabric of
space-time
and then if those Technologies are
weaponized it&#39;s over in a fraction of a
second so the proof I said to one senior
military guy that they are not hostile
is that you and I are still breathing
the Freer of Earth if you know what
we&#39;ve been doing it&#39;s quite clear that
this is uh actually proof that they&#39;re
not hostile if you understand what those
Technologies are and if you understand
what covert illegal projects have been
doing
here&#39;s a question
any you know intervention
by the aliens or the people you know
there is this power and there&#39;s people
in control if we don&#39;t fix this
ourselves is there going to be any kind
of intervention from
from up there if we continue to destroy
the Earth as as we are
well that&#39;s what I spoke to a moment ago
I think that
there are two clocks ticking
one is operations within the
constitutional government United States
uh
that are not going to put up with this
any further more than another six to
nine months the other is the fact that
these extraterrestrial civilizations
cannot afford for this progression of
Technology being deployed against them
these have been revert much of it&#39;s been
reverse engineered from the ET Vehicles
right and so at a certain point where do
they have to do something to protect
other places because there&#39;s a universal
principle of self-defense so far we&#39;ve
just been cruising along getting away
with this foolish and childish behavior
but uh I can&#39;t give you a timeline on
that but I think that I honestly from
what I&#39;ve heard from very senior
intelligent sources inside the so-called
illegal operations is that it&#39;s thought
that it would not be able to go on
Beyond 2026.
so maybe within three years
yes
well I think that at first there&#39;s
denial shock it&#39;s like the stages of
death frankly
um but I know the people that I&#39;ve been
with in in the last year and a half and
providing this information which they&#39;ve
then confirmed it has been an
existential crisis for them
psychologically organizationally
Etc I won&#39;t say who I&#39;ve been doing this
with but it is traumatic one of the
chief folks they started help working
with us on this he asked me to give them
everything we had I did very senior
intelligence person and you know we had
two black hawks over his house shaking
his house with his kids in it the next
day with just hovering there very
threatening this is a very courageous
man a hero of the country who is unnamed
uh but what I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s
going to be a process because there&#39;s so
much to know and it&#39;s so shocking and I
think most people in the media and in
government cannot believe what Senator
annually knew in 1987 and confirmed to
Mr Garcia in 2001 and I think that you
want to sort of go into denial this just
can&#39;t be I did have someone years ago
who was uh
member of the Canadian
military say this is the hottest potato
in the universe nobody wants to deal
with it and this is another problem it&#39;s
easier just to go
this is too difficult
too dangerous I&#39;m just going to pay
attention to what the next tax bill is
or whatever it is and I understand that
I mean honestly I sometimes wish I&#39;d
never found out what I did
about this issue I got kind of dragged
into
getting involved at this level and I
never thought I would have to in my
navite as a young doctor I thought well
you know you tell the right people this
you provide the evidence and they fix it
but you know and they should have they
should have but I think at this point it
just becomes very difficult for them and
this is why what we&#39;re trying to do if
we can get some help from guys here and
listening is that we need someone who&#39;s
a very good data scientist and data file
uh person to take this entire archive
finish and only part of it&#39;s been
scanned in
we have enormous amount yet to do and so
it can be organized and then I would do
briefing modules maybe I don&#39;t know a
dozen 20 of them that would connect all
that evidence and testimony into
intelligence assessments now I&#39;ve done a
number of these when you know back in
the day I provided intelligence
assessments to folks because ultimately
the comprehensive assessment based on
multiple terabytes of data hundreds of
witness testimonies thousands of
government documents that has to be put
together in something sensible but
that&#39;s a very heavy lift by the way but
I think that&#39;s what we need to do so
that if you&#39;re the National Security
advisor or the president or chairman of
a committee in the in or their members
that they can go from understanding it
in a methodical way because it&#39;s so much
to unpack and it&#39;s so overwhelming and
but that&#39;s just something I haven&#39;t had
time to do on my free time we&#39;ll work on
it together yes
yes thank you very much I understand
your proposition of benevolence uh I&#39;d
like to follow up a little bit with the
gentleman over there said about hostile
intention one of intention of our uh EBS
have you ever had any information or
relate to you towards a genetic
manipulation of the species that have
been ongoing or previously talked about
which would of course construe a
national security threat uh to The
Republic has any of that ever come your
way
well I&#39;ve certainly heard about it but
what I&#39;ve heard is the reverse
that are classified projects have taken
genetic material and altered it for
various purposes including cloning
projects in these program life forms so
in reality it&#39;s probably flown the other
way from the folks I&#39;ve heard look I&#39;ve
been told we have to be out of here at
five I thank you for your patience I
know we went over about an hour but help
us if you can and God bless all of you
we&#39;ll see you soon
thank you
