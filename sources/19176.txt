my name is Larry Warren and in December
of 1980 I was assigned to the 81st
Tactical Fighter Wing here in suffolk
east anglia at the nato air base has
been waters in woodbridge twin base
conflicts at the time and i was security
specialists in that men I worked with
securing the Arsenal the nuclear arsenal
we secretly housed here at that time
tactical weapons battlefield grade
against terrorist attack on December
11th 1980 my security clearance known as
PRP came through and I was approved for
it my clearance was a secret clearance
at that time
when it comes to the UFO incident that
took place near Aria food bridge which
is our sister base six miles apart
separated by a pine forest known as
Rendlesham forest I was into my second
week in on the flight line working the
night shift we had just come off a break
the previous flight C flight had I did
not realize this but on boxing night
Boxing Day morning early in the hours
two nights before my event because I was
off-duty and things were clamped down
what happened is is that a security
policeman named John Burroughs and an
airman Parker were at the east gate of
RAF Woodbridge that phaeton if you look
from the gate out to the forest it&#39;s a
pot course again pine forest beyond that
about nine miles away is the Orford Key
and the North Sea with the orphaned
lighthouse on it I will qualify that we
were all familiar with the beam the
lighthouse which people have tried to
downplay these events as saying we
missed identified airman Burroughs saw
what appeared to be an object in the
forest at the east end of the runway
just within the trees multicolored
lights it he suspected maybe an aircraft
had crashed but there was something
wrong with that he called him the
central security control on Bentwaters
reported what he was seeing a shift
supervisor named Jim Penniston responded
he was a staff sergeant responded to the
scene a few other personnel arrived I
wasn&#39;t involved in this but this is what
I know of it they pursued the phenomena
into the woods they definitely thought
there was an air crash and when started
to begin those procedures we were not
allowed to take arms off the base due to
our treaty with Great Britain at the
time any incidents outside of the base
the British military or console area
would take care of these men got
permission to proceed on foot into the
forest to investigate these lights
according and there&#39;s a lot of
information on what they saw in
the MSN Network Jim Penniston has given
terrific statements on the computer you
know of his experience with Burroughs
and there was a another airman named
cabana sac there and then a fourth
person who I don&#39;t know whose name it
was they pursued the phenomena they
found that it was not an aircraft but a
triangular object about six feet at the
base that rose to a nine foot point it
was black like glass
or fabric they described it as a great
density to it black they didn&#39;t know if
it was on a tripod or on legs of some
sort but it had multicolored lights
around and each of these individuals
have given somewhat conflicting
statements as their perception of what
they were looking at I do know this
based on his own testimony that sergeant
Penniston at one point these men did
bring their side arms which are 38
calibers that the law-enforcement people
carried we carried m16s none of them
were brought to the forest sergeant
Penniston drew his revolver when they
encountered this object and saw clearly
it wasn&#39;t anything they were familiar
with these are all highly trained
observers as we all were at that time
for aircraft or unusual things sergeant
Penniston drew his revolver and aimed it
at the phenomena at some point his n&#39;t
his next memory and I&#39;m trying to
paraphrase here he approached this
phenomena very close to it observed a
panel on its side with some sort of
language similar to hieroglyphics it was
somewhat familiar to him but he couldn&#39;t
identify the script and it was raised
from the surface he touched it and felt
the surface it felt warm to a degree and
the contexture of glass almost the
consistency and hardness and he they
sensed there was movement with him
through this opaque kind of glass
sergeant Penniston heard a voice and
this is some recent testimony obviously
they feel easier he&#39;s a retired man from
the Air Force now honorably retired and
probably very willing to talk about this
on the record
a voice came into his head so we
perceived and I don&#39;t know what it will
how this went but from what I understand
he asked the phenomena who are you and
it responded we are you and it gave a
number of half a million years down the
line and biological things all this
information flew through his head that
there was a biological need to come here
and all kinds of things he probably
would say it much better inaccurately
but it gives a dimension of the high
strangeness of this event these men had
four hours of missing time the radio
communications had failed with the base
luckily enough some other personnel
obviously did respond to see what was
happening with these people and some
brought cameras but observed this
activity much in shock and stabbed some
photos part of my story unwillingly is
that in the last year and a half because
of the book I wrote left at his gate
some of these witnesses contacted me and
a gentleman released some of these
photos they&#39;re not spectacular but they
do show light phenomena that needs
further work these men were debriefed
the next morning they were retrieved
dazed in the forest they made statements
immediately they were debriefed they
were given injections of what were they
were told with sodium pentathol by some
element of the Air Force so airman
Burroughs told me directly John
Burroughs who lives in the state of
Arizona I&#39;m not sure his location right
now but is Arizona originally from
Chicago told me that he knew the next
day within the next two days that this
phenomena was going to return and it
indeed did their shift it ended that
thing my shift came on there was
evidence left by this encounter pot
indentations on the ground
the British Suffolk Constabulary
responded to this the next morning
because it was an incident it was
reported to them from the base security
police operations desk they came and
they these triangular and Charles Hall
can explain this very accurately because
he was present on site for the
investigation was that these pods were
in a perfect nine-foot separation of a
triangle they represented something two
and a half metric
tons sitting down there was a break in
the canopy of the Corsican Pines was
something clearly came through it there
was background readings and Nick Pope
can actually offer some more information
on this via the Ministry of Defense is
that the background readings were 25
times higher than the normal natural
background radiation in that area how
these readings came up is that sergeant
nevels who was the disaster preparedness
man on the base at that time had the
geiger counters and knew how to read
them and these readings were taken from
this Ground Zero area there was residual
on the trees and everything I was put on
a very remote post at the end of RAF
Bentwaters flight line called perimeter
post 18 it was an alert man position so
it was normally not manned in this
dugout or bunker I went to my position
was uneventful for about an hour and a
half what I noticed first was some an
animal disturbance where some deers ran
down to a rather low fence we had at
that time surrounding the base and these
deer herd of deer jumped the fence and
ran past my position right over the
runway and they seemed spooked or I had
that feeling suddenly from the WUSA we
had an 80-foot tall tower which oversaw
the facility also could see overt RAF
Woodbridge and the Rendlesham forest in
that it&#39;s called speak ads and that&#39;s
all the electronic monitoring by highly
trained specialists and security police
particularly to watch over the ordinance
and all kind of and I started to hear
chatter on the open frequencies we had
motorola radios at that time we had four
channels of security police operational
active channels I started to hear
commentary about lights over the forest
toward Woodbridge those lights are back
again and I was looking up and suddenly
at this point I get a call from
lieutenant Bruce England who was a
security police officer former Army
Special Forces I think in went of the
Air Force called up and he was the shift
commander
that time and said airman war and
deactivate your post you&#39;re going to be
picked up by a govt which government
operated vehicle a truck and pulled up
and Sergeant Adrian Adrian vez tenza who
is my reporting official was the driver
lieutenant England was in the passenger
seat and there were other personnel new
personnel like me in the back I was told
to get in
we went immediately to the Bentwaters
motor pool we refilled we were fueling
up light all switch maintenance people
would have done that they threw all of
them out they weren&#39;t around there was a
lot of chatter about people trying to
find the base Co and just a lot of
frequencies they were saying change
frequencies put all the radios down all
of this I must tell you was recorded in
CSC on the the tapes they make of that
night those were stolen and so were the
logs of that period that Charles hull
can confirm also they came up missing in
a few days when he went looking at that
listed personnel on duty and a lot of
different things incident reports and
everything they were gone but we had
fully autumn you know we had our NATO
rounds in the weaponry which is very
unusual and there was an urgency among
senior people went down a logging trail
into the forest there was an armored
vehicle after about a half a mile into
the woods I haven&#39;t talked about this in
a while because I wrote it and thought
I&#39;d never have to the feeling in the
forest is very strange movement was odd
perception was odd the minute we entered
the forest I will tell you this there
was a problem something was wrong we
pulled out there were some other
vehicles there was an armored vehicle
they took our weapons off as each weapon
is assigned by number anyway and it&#39;s
with you for your whole assignment and
that was taken away from us we broke up
into four-man units I could we headed
down a trail into the forest Charles
halt was out there at that night with a
smaller party of senior people who tend
to England join them at one point I saw
there was a lot of radio contact we had
to maintain radio silence the lower
ranking guys but I could hear on other
open channels them staying you guys
coming in have to avoid those hot spots
we don&#39;t want you walking all over them
I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s the
far
as fire what&#39;s going on and in reality
they were it was more site investigation
going on at that period I think they had
anticipated these objects return
sergeant burrows by the way from the
first night knew it was coming back and
arrived at the field off-duty in
civilian closed abscessed to get back
near the phenomena you can hear on the
actual tape Charles Holt made that night
one of the people on the perimeter
securing and access to the forest
calling Charles hold on the radio saying
airman burrows and two other individuals
wish to rendezvous at your location and
Charles Howell responds tell them
negative at this time will tell them
when they can come out here we don&#39;t
want anyone out here right now this tape
you will have and this tape should be
heard by all interesting parties mr.
Hall can come in and on it further
though we differed greatly on a lot of
perceptions we were on the same side a
lot of ways what I saw isn&#39;t a pretty
you know I I talked about it earlier I
wish it was much simpler than what it
was we as we moved through this forest
in this small group I was with sergeant
Pistons a it was Robert ball was their
shift supervisor so Masterson and a lot
of other people came to a clearing
called cable green at the end of the
course again pine and there was a
phenomena on the ground in this field it
was like a mist it looked like a fog on
the ground there was a cinematic film
camera a movie camera present and there
was a very large egami type video camera
they were very large at that time these
came from public affairs on Bentwaters
there was anticipation of the return of
the phenomena there is a fill a trail on
this film that is established not just
this isn&#39;t just me talking I think I&#39;m
telling you I can can pretty much be
backed up in any court of law and
especially with the body of the evidence
and I&#39;m willing to do I was observing
this and of course I can describe this
in a way it sounds like a bad science
fiction movie but I will say that my
senses were not as they are now or as
they would have been hours before I was
present there and others felt the same
it was like watching a
this mist was on the ground it was being
observed there was disaster preparedness
present there was a house off to the
left farmer&#39;s house I&#39;d never been out
in as far as before there was a light on
in this house so those people were home
there was a dog barking I remember
clearly I saw a light come in we could
see the beam of the Orford light house
in this clearance by the clearing by the
way very clearly this case has been
written off as a misidentification of
this lighthouse an exaggeration or
whatever in reality that it was there
for over 100 years and was no surprise
to anyone this object a red basketball
shaped object a min from the North Sea
area over the trees I thought it was a
tail light on an aircraft it moved so
quickly that it was it would it came in
over the trees I go to this site all the
time and I see it as clear as day did a
downward arc over Capel green which I
didn&#39;t know the name of this plot of
land at that time came to a point over
this mist now it&#39;s been misrepresented
it was a mist on the ground it&#39;s sea
appeared to have structure was 50 foot
across this basketball-sized
amber light it didn&#39;t seem solid I
couldn&#39;t tell you what it was was 20
feet above the object this mist as soon
as I got a fix on that and everyone else
did but I will tell you the cameras were
up on it these people were reacting but
everything was like hello and very slow
there was an explosion this is described
it&#39;s very hard for me to describe it it
was a this thing broke up into multiple
shards of extremely bright light I
another suffered and I have documents of
this because I stole them from Bev
waters because an officer advised me to
because he said your military record is
going to vaporize soon as you&#39;re gone my
eyes were damaged flash burns to the
retinas and all this is established as
if I stare at an arc welders torch for
about 10 minutes which is unadvisable
everything was very bizarre at that
point in the place of this explosion of
light very silent there was no sound
anything was a structured solid object
rather large probably 30 feet at the
base
to a pyramid type shape no windows flags
on it was very rough raid it was it
would distort it as you looked at it
with a rainbow like effect and yet
through peripheral vision you could get
a fix that all this is dreamlike I will
tell you there was severe evidence for
this plate thing where it&#39;s at to this
day and this one won&#39;t let anyone down
this case believe me then and this this
thing was there on the ground and it was
filmed and it was photographed there was
in British bobbies present on Charles
Hall&#39;s tape you hear the Suffolk
Constabulary pull up in the forest with
their British police vehicle because
their siren was on for a bit and we
didn&#39;t have that horn and that&#39;s proved
to me that they were there these police
are unattainable that they won&#39;t talk to
anyone they had a camera and one was
taken off one of the British police
already an international incident was
brewing here our Wing Commander Gordon
Williams who was at a party I believe
that night for the wing arrived on site
with other senior people there were
British military present they could have
been at the party and I will say they
seemed to know how to deal with an event
like this I have no recollection of any
sound emitting from this it was almost
like a mirage and yet I know it was
solid because I left trace and evidence
at all but it was so beyond anything and
it&#39;s right in front of us it was at
least 30 feet away from it at one point
to close there was a life form in
association with it this all I can just
cut to the chase which we perceived I
perceived I remember thinking and you&#39;ve
heard other witnesses say this and my as
children what are these children doing
here and the mind starts scrambling but
they were almost there was in light
there was bright light and there was
movement and these things had a an upper
body I clearly saw within when I saw an
arm when I perceived to the arms move
I&#39;m like Mike you know you just you&#39;re
in another place at that point what I
saw was on the right side Delta of this
bizarre object machine what
this bright light move dad was bluish
gold it was about a foot off the ground
it split and it was only about four feet
in height from the ground up but it
split away and three individual kind of
oblong cocoons of light with this thing
in it these in three individual things
inside of people or things like human
they were humanoid you know they were
humanoid there was near the height of
them yeah they would have been about in
high private of four feet really I mean
the child Rijn the light diminished and
that&#39;s where they&#39;re you could see what
was in it and I&#39;m thinking about the I
don&#39;t know what I thought really know
they would hairless but there was
clothing there was an apparatus attached
I can&#39;t describe a dark thing and I
could not see the lower extremities
because the light these these were not
walking on the ground these things and I
wish I never saw this but there was a
white membrane around what our eyes
large eyes and the white membrane was
moving adapting it was like your eyes
adjusting the light and the the thing it
was just doing this the movement of
these lights therein was just kind of a
wavering thing the commander was there
and this is where I I swear there&#39;s got
to be a protocol and if in the event of
something like this I don&#39;t know as a
feeling of opinion and he moved forward
and at that point we were called out of
the area by rank in fact a lot of lower
ranking people were involved in this and
sent back to the vehicles on our way
back there was a lot of phenomena in the
forest these lights these light beings
or whatever there were other crafts
around in the tree above the trees
almost as if they were guarding this
thing and backing it up and I will tell
you that airman burrows and he needs to
be spoken it speak to someone and he
needs to be
in in front of a responsible body this
man can make a big difference was in the
parking area all the vehicles where they
would not let him out to the sites
Charles Hall was pursuing other light
phenomena with getting beams fired down
to the ground right in front of him
literally pencil-sized beams from this
these Crescent light phenomena making a
recording as it all happened for hours
of audio you&#39;ve got 18 minutes of
dynamite my event was happening about a
half-mile away in fact on that tape you
see here at the beginning of my event I
will clarify this I was on the record
long before the whole tape became public
and I was the one that made the whole
tape go public and I turned it over to
CNN I&#39;ve never taken a penny for
anything I&#39;ve done with this ever I
never have as we left I will tell you
verbatim because airman Burroughs told
me this or John Burroughs is that this
another object appeared right in the
midst of a lot of security personnel at
the motor at the parking area or other
trucks were and personnel that backline
personnel and appeared right in the
midst of them Airmen Burroughs grabbed
this object and it moved over the ground
ten meters with him holding on to it
it&#39;s an absolute fact he physically
touched it he moved with this thing on
it it took off it got away from John
another beam of light came down there
was one guy a security personnel in a
pickup truck this thing was following
one of these beings in the the light
literally falling he jumped in a pickup
truck slammed the door and it passed
through the glass right in front of mini
freak then kicked the windscreen right
out of the truck this thing went out the
other window I know this person this was
happened in front of many people too
went out the other window which was
rolled up it&#39;s December turned away from
the vehicle a blue beam of light came
down from above the trees this thing got
on it and ran right up into something
that was dark and looked like a pine
cone with white pins of light on it was
a dark against the night sky above it
was watching over this another officer
has said that he felt that these objects
had been there looking for something
they were conducting grids
the night before there were three nights
of activity but they were there for a
reason and it was kind of like okay
we&#39;re here for a purpose
you guys are bothering us so we&#39;re going
to show you what you need to show but
we&#39;re going to accomplish what we need
to do I will tell you on that night and
this is from Charles Holt himself on the
record we&#39;re off the record actually but
he did say it we interviewed him at
length
but he did tell us this and my co-author
that he a said to me were you aware that
on that night these objects over here on
the tape we have one object hovering
over Woodbridge Base and Bentwaters
there&#39;s a witness witnesses are coming
out now saying unbeknownst to us there
were three massive triangular objects
over the base over the forest and over
the Woodbridge base the whole time and
there was missing time with so much many
personnel over this period it was
amazing I didn&#39;t see that phenomena but
so much to this it never gets simple my
roommate came in and talked to him he
wasn&#39;t working that shift in law
enforcement I noticed I had a shock of
gray hair that did fall out but
literally a shock of gray hair on the
right side my eyes were watering
profusely I had a metallic taste in my
mouth and I was almost hallucinatory I
was having him the room was warping and
everything and sweating I was sweating
profusely and head coach chills we had
secured phones on the base obviously but
being rather young and naive I didn&#39;t
pay attention to the COMSEC rules
communication security and we had a
phone where I knew they&#39;d always listen
in on your calls but I went to a public
phone box would may used to have them
here on the base reverse the charges to
my mom and I said mom you won&#39;t believe
this I got I remember answering she does
too so you&#39;ll never believe this greg
was right with me I said last night so
it was actually hours earlier I said
last night a UFO landed on base and we
saw everything and you wouldn&#39;t believe
and I&#39;m just thinking she&#39;s not
responding uh she&#39;s gone I looked at
Greg oh my god I got cut off I call the
operators and listen and you reconnect
me she goes are you calling from the
base I go yeah she goes I&#39;m sorry you
were cut off from the base and hung up
on me didn&#39;t even offered her and I
looked at Greg I said man I think I&#39;m in
trouble
so we ran back to my dorm Malcolm
Ziggler it was a major was the chief of
security police&#39;s underling was major
carl Drury all involved in one or aspect
or another of these events major
Ziegler&#39;s from West Hartford Connecticut
originally and we had some common ground
I&#39;d live there and we get to the office
there was a Jaguar outside there was
another expensive card remember what it
was now and I thought oh here we go the
debriefing well first of all there were
all the lower ranking guys there were no
people above sergeant in my group we
were debriefed in a compartmentalized
way which I understand now that I didn&#39;t
I said oh my god they&#39;re going to tell
us to shut up I know it because I
suspect you heard rumors then of that
you know went way beyond that they&#39;ll
name names
there were person people in plain
clothes
going in and out of the the security
police law enforcement desk and that was
unusual civilian looking people and I&#39;m
like oh boy while we were gone over with
a civilian looking not disaster
preparedness with a Geiger counter and
they said did any of you retreat remove
anything from the forest while you&#39;re in
there anything Rock twig anything they
kept asking this over and over and they
said if you have and are not going to
tell us now you&#39;re subject to the UCMJ
all these article 15 beyond that jail
Leavenworth everything and we were young
we&#39;re all new or like oh my god we
haven&#39;t even started here and were in
trouble
there was one returned on one of the
guys and he something was taken out of
his pocket this guy was removed very
quickly and I will swear on my life I
never saw him again he was removed this
happened to a lot of people it led to a
suicide that the Air Force is
responsible for there&#39;s a real person
with a real name that base by the way
after that eventually adopted the
highest rate of suicide and NATO this is
an established fact one of the captains
involves was found hanging in his back
garden from a tree married with children
everything all these people started to
shoot kill themselves I mean this is
absolutely at the movie JFK but I lived
it and I&#39;m amazed they got out of there
alive keep it very simple and focused on
me and I apologize for going off in ways
is that we were brought into the office
there were roses see it&#39;s a very small
law enforcement desk and he no one was
being held there the law enforcement
operators that they were kept out the
office it was everything was different
on that base now brought in we were
there were sheets on top of the law
enforcement desk we went in filed it in
a line there were about ten of us one
two three four five six seven stacks of
documents pre-typed one was a pre typed
statement all generic of what we saw
which was not what we saw it said we
were off-duty and saw only unknown
lights flipping amongst the trees
clearly remember that I said wonder if
we don&#39;t sign this major Ziegler knee
goes you have no choice and he goes I
have no choice but to ask you to do this
I kept seeing these other personnel in
his office because we&#39;re him they&#39;re
next he said you will sign I think there
were four documents one was the UCMJ
secrecy thing I forget janap one
something whatever and that clearly said
Gienapp it was a traditional thing but
there were other things that we couldn&#39;t
read you&#39;ll be able to read them later
put your signature on social security
number we were filed into his office
there was a movie screen set up there
were two rows of chairs metal chairs
folded out major Ziegler left and what
was looking at me as I walked through
were two gentlemen in civilian clothes
big people very business looking
American they had plastic ID with a
photo thing and it said Armed Forces
security services I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s
air force we have been told that is a
field arm of the National Security
Agency and they were intimidating people
and they didn&#39;t smile or anything they
just you know we&#39;re like what do we do
and they&#39;re like this we were in uniform
and they asked us specifically where the
uniforms we were wearing in the in the
field and I think that was for the
Geiger counter thing we sat down and a
naval commander that came from US Navy
oh ni London his name was Richardson and
it was a command
Richardson was his rank yeah the rings
he was in uniform and was very affable
with us basically it went like this
I am sitting next to a friend of mine
from Alabama we called Alabama and
Alabama was religiously already at this
point so unwrapped that Satan had
encountered him and that he had a
handheld Bible and was just under us
there was like speaking in tongues
almost reading this he was gone and
being so young at 19 the human condition
isn&#39;t apparent to a lot of people in
people&#39;s pain and trauma but I was
watching what this guy I knew melting
down next to me he&#39;s one guy that didn&#39;t
make it and he is a name and he had a
family and everything they didn&#39;t care
about that but what he did say is that
when we&#39;re all numb but this was very
clear he said in a nutshell you Airmen
have been exposed to something that we
have known about for longer than any one
of you in this room are aware of and he
said like this it was all matter of fact
there was no hot lights on us we&#39;re just
hearing and I wasn&#39;t surprised and he
said there is a phenomena that has been
coming here for many many years some of
it comes and goes some of it is a
permanent presence they didn&#39;t say a
phenomena they said various
civilizations advanced civilizations and
there was a lot of techie words that I
wasn&#39;t familiar with but I put this kind
of my own interpretation a lot of
militaries and the read there was a lot
of the reasons for secrecy national
security your best to go on with your
lives
and one of the one of the guys in the
room said wonder if we say something and
he goes notice now your mail will be
monitored for as long as you were in the
military to have a good career in the
military and phones by the way he said
the best way to go about is not
discussing this with anyone even each
other from this point on go about your
lives forget about all this move on with
your lives with the knowing that you
have seen something that few people will
ever get to see and he said and he said
but it was all new
the other word was loyalty to national
security our oath serving the country
and it was brainwashing his office and
it was repetitive lines and there was a
drone to his voice this was brilliant we
were shown gun they showed a film they
said we were going to show you a film
that might help you best put into
perspective what you wear what you
gentlemen have witnessed and help you
maybe put it to bed a little bit for
yourselves we were also told though if
any of us have any unusual dreams we we
were as a number we were to call daily
for the next month any unusual dreams if
anyone was trying to pry information out
of us they said that there would be a
possibility of Soviet infiltration of
the area to try to get information from
us at that time it was the Cold War and
they said be aware of anything we were
to report that immediately but even if
our fellow Airmen asked us well we were
shown a film and they ran the film I
mean it was just a film and a reel it
was non narration he did not narrate it
it began with gun camera footage what I
can only assume from maybe the 40s it
showed some aircraft property of an
aircraft broad daylight look like
Florida Keys with a fleet of silver
disco under at broad daylight like the
movie camera was coming out of the
canopy that was one of the first frames
Korea era a MIG flying a lot of Rocky
Mountains a black-and-white footage an
object coming by this big and the MiG&#39;s
spinning out and hitting the mountain
and exploding and the camera pulls away
and there was a howitzer or something
and a people running this way clip
changes this thing went all the way up
to the space program the best clip on it
showed the beret of the 5th Special
Forces Vietnam on a red clay Hill low
scrub brush guy with a camera a lot of
them had shirts off or whatever and the
care I don&#39;t know if it was Laos
Cambodia or what I don&#39;t even know the
year but it was in color turn the camera
and this giant green kind of
delta-shaped thing rises out of the
brush very slowly and deliberately below
where they are up to face level camera
level and then continues but shrubbery
and brush is
falling off this massive thing and a
flock of big kind of pelicans or Birds
go right under it and I&#39;ll never forget
that my life I remember that better than
the incident in the field the space
program it showed and I swear to God it
showed structures on the moon
these Box kind of things that looks
tan-colored it showed that lunar car
moving around
I remember those clearly because I&#39;ve
ever being a child when all that was
happening but then at a distance
pointing astronauts pointing at these
box looking things structured objects
moving off the surface of the Moon film
by definite Apollo missions and what did
the structure is coming off the moon the
structures on is I know this is the moon
because was the Apollo error looked like
a continuation of the color of the moon
but they were structured to it like huge
box kind of things very Square and
angular structures without windows or
any kind of thing like that but they
were artificial clearly and they were
being filmed too great and then when
there were lights and weird things on
top of hills and whites dish oh yeah now
they look pristine and we&#39;re they look
like giant shoe many UFOs very clearly
in different scenes where a lot of it
was with the lunar car that mission some
of it was the astronauts on spacewalks
and something dark coming right up near
them with red points of red light I
remember that all of this is very quick
they never showed it again the Apollo is
the kind of the era where it kind of
ended I immediately after getting back
to the dorm with Greg bathroom after
calling my mother her getting cut off
being told by this operator were you cut
off from the base and I said were you
cut off and I said yes because you were
cut off from the base click I knew I was
in trouble I was called to the
communications section of Bentwaters I
knew it was coming a staff sergeant was
there in a captain it was a black man
and I know I can&#39;t think of his name
right now it is in the book and that is
his actual name I was a debrief man I
was asked questions there was a Teac
reel-to-reel present in the debriefing
and they kept asking me have you given
sensitive information not classified
sensitive information out over the over
landlines and over and over and I said
no no and they said do you want to go
with that and I said no i mean the s i
was lying through my teeth and they
played the tape and here&#39;s me hi my you
never believe and they said they said
airman Warren you have to understand
every phone on this base is monitored
all the time anyway I was told that I
would I was not given an article 15
because that&#39;s traceable I would be
fined $300 and if I did any other breed
any trouble I&#39;d lose my stripes there
was a paper trail on that fine and no
explanation
and even as late as 99 ever paid it
because I got out I paid they&#39;d would
deduct some out of my pay but even as of
1986 they tried to retrieve and
threatening me with the IRS and
everything
madness their crazy the machine is crazy
and a lot of guys have been through the
event and sergeant Penniston was sitting
right there and someone Steve on jro
asked me goes what the hell happened it
was last night
and sergeant Penniston who was senior he
goes shut the [ __ ] up Warren shut the
oh my god I threw my tray down just
walked out it was all downhill from
there my friend
later that night sergeant the stims and
myself and I swear it happened two
others received a phone call
sergeant Pistons in I were to meet this
vehicle at 5:00 p.m. that afternoon was
dark at that point in England we both
walked up I said I said hi busty how you
doing he goes all right and we both walk
toward this vehicle the door was opened
there was a guy sitting there but there
was a lot of construction material as a
barrier where this thing was in reality
what happened as two people came up
behind each of us and I do remember
someone heading toward him and I heard
the sound of what sound like an air
assault and I went black but I my memory
conscious for years was that the
interior lights of the car were too
bright and I just blacked out in reality
it was much clearer as in the last few
years a lot of that is broken we were
hit with an aerosol of some sort
I literally could see I could hear I
could not see and my nose ran profusely
and I had my chest out tight I obviously
was not getting into the car properly so
I was beaten literally hitting in the
ribs and pushed and I was resisting and
I know sergeant Estanza was doing the
same thing I had identified myself as a
problem it turns out years later that he
had made some phone calls to we were
taken somewhere on the Bentwaters flight
line I knew this by the sound of where
we went when I was removed from that car
I cut my face because I fell out of it
obviously being a mobile and hit a patch
of concrete and ice was lift carried
literally bodily face down and I
remember my nose running so profusely
and I couldn&#39;t wipe it or anything I
didn&#39;t know if it was bleeding or what I
know we descended I will tell you there
was an underground facility on that base
that is to this day if someone would do
some work on this it&#39;s there and
someone&#39;s got to know about this but
also reality have more memories of it
being a very clinical situation we do
know at this time a lot of people on the
base there were teams in the forest
aircraft came into Woodbridge that even
the commanders of the base had no access
to get near or asked why they were there
teams in white coveralls were going
throughout the forest there were
intelligence people on the base that
were never there before these are all
things that can be established as fact
for many other people but I think also
screen memories were given us because my
conscious memory of that is that I would
I&#39;m down I have 20 minutes a recall and
I&#39;m gone for a day and it&#39;s established
other people people said I was on
emergency leave or on leave or off the
base other people would verify it I was
just under it there were other people
there
I remember being brought into a there
was a lot of high tech and machinery
huge vaulted glass like ceilings panels
of glass walls I D like a subway wall
but huge glass panels we were brought to
one area and I have a conscious memory
whether it&#39;s real or not of looking into
a very dark void
having someone to the side of me
explaining that there were tunnels that
connect the bases there are tunnels from
the bases to the North Sea
these tunnels that were lit tunnels I
can still see them in my mind were
massive and they entered they led out
into the Orford Key the North Sea near
low stuff clearly was told that and
there was phenomena in this huge void
that we were separated from from this
molded glass type area with rails and I
believe that was our record way before
the all the stuff in the late 80s I mean
and I never wanted this and other people
were with me with this and have verified
parts of it whether this is a screen
memory though I don&#39;t know this could be
the MK ULTRA I don&#39;t know and I saw
technology down there that they we were
told all kinds of things but this was
non earthly non earth-based technology
that they were based there and I swear
to God I was on way before the pop
culture of this with this I&#39;d rather
this not be the case my I have another
memory of being in a room where there
were red aircraft like seats we were I
was myself a number of other Airmen were
unable to move I&#39;ve talked heads could
not turn but you could see there was no
pay screen and somebody they&#39;ve said in
alien told us this there was a person or
something that we couldn&#39;t see or eyes
couldn&#39;t focus and there was a
telepathic communication with all of us
but I couldn&#39;t hear the other ones and
I&#39;ve talked to other guys and went
through this thing where all kinds of
things about religion about how religion
was Korean all the old thing but was
created for us that these things can
become human I mean they they they&#39;re
there in society and all these kind of
like just God was gone and it knew
things about me that were personal and
it was amazing but I saw the guys having
reactions trying to move and know what
none of us could my next memory
conscious memory of about 20 minutes 10
minutes 15 minutes of conscious recall
of these bizarre scenarios my next
recall is just literally broad daylight
walking out into the
sunshine from the base photographic lab
what did come out which I don&#39;t
consciously remember what they come I
was very terrestrial thing where we were
hit with an air with an exotic aerosol
and I&#39;ve been told that kind of thing
can happen causing paralysis I remember
a very clinical I pulled my I wanted to
get out of the situation being in this
facility but more on an underground
facility but being in a very clinical
like ER setting being against the wall
and then having to sit and wait seeing a
colonel down there oh I don&#39;t recognize
him a lot of other people but a lot of
younger guys I went through this with
and being on a table and having Air
Force seeing Air Force senior people and
some other unidentified people talking
to down to me I know I was looking up at
them with bright lights and I had marks
by the way from IV or something when I
came out of there I had the bruise and I
had a bandage I will admit that that&#39;s
for real I had it I&#39;m terrified to know
or think of what might have happened so
I&#39;ve only pursued it a little bit I
wrote my mother a letter and I wrote the
letter to a week and a half before
Charles halt authored the actual halt
memo which was gained by the freedom of
information it was a document that reads
like science fiction Air Force
letterhead that he wrote it&#39;s a
minimization I believe intentional but
it reads like science fiction and was
released in 1983 through citizens
against UFO secrecy based on information
I supply them after numerous denials
that it existed from the Air Force
itself there&#39;s a whole paper trail with
that the site is also the air part of
the site of the 1956 Bentwaters
Lakenheath radar visual contact case
which is considered still to this day
the best contact case of its kind
documented so there has a history
already when it comes to the physical
trace evidence to the the capable I
don&#39;t know what happened to the earlier
incident with Burroughs and Penniston
because there was a lot of evidence pot
and podcasts were made for the
indentations Charles Holt still has
possession of one of them and does show
people this and would show it to any
congressional body I think
these were plaster cast for me and I
think a couple said so that most have
ended up missing but from my night and
also soil analysis was done on that but
it was all swept away all these years
later from 1988 to 900 spoil analysis
many of this stuff analyzed by
springboard environmental labs in
Massachusetts by accredited scientists
and the results of this we have the
published findings we will a lot of it
isn&#39;t left at Eastgate there was a
further result that did not make it but
is phenomenal of an absolute phenomena
to place only in that spot to a level of
three feet down and as a layman all I
can best tell you that the evidence
scientifically analyzed shows that a lot
of the investigators ignore the capable
greensight yet it bears the most fruit
in a lot of ways is that plant
alteration plants do not grow in this
one spot no matter what crop we&#39;ve
talked to the farmers for 20 years
however the soil is darker it does not
absorb water it has a totally almost
crystalline mixed with a very dried dirt
like freeze-dried coffee and I guess
some of the analysis that we have the
results turn over to anyone gratis is
that something sat there at one time it
was in a theoretical way heating the
soil to a degree in a microwave
industrial microwave oven to a super
high heat and then dropping it instantly
into a sub-zero freeze in almost a
conical direction down but I do know
this for a fact is that Gordon Williams
we were told was dead some years ago in
1988 by a fellow flight commander on the
base al Brown who was a very good friend
of his al Brown whose wonder would tell
you well I never knew a thing never
heard a thing we know that whole
squadron was B braved the pilots and all
but Allen trained all of them but never
knew a thing except he heard a few
things on the golf course very close
friend Goren Williams calls him Gordo
and Gordon Williams was gotten off that
base so quick as I was his bodyguard at
his change of command ceremony and
1881 March I knew who he was I&#39;m
familiar and I know he was the man I saw
in that field but Gordon met Williams
allegedly has lost his memory from 1984
previous because he was bitten by a bug
in the Philippines and was given surgery
by the Air Force the type of surgeons
that work on the brain it affected his
brain and he has no recollection before
that point because of a bug bite and I&#39;m
glad he made when it comes to were there
radar returns on all nights in question
RAF wotton on the third night and the
first night picked up their Eastern
radar by the way picked up an object
over Rendlesham forest descending into
the forest
the next day US Air Force went awry of
what and talked to the air traffic
controllers told them that an alien
spacecraft they swore they were under
the Official Secrets landed in
Rendlesham forest there was contact with
the base commander and they were
confiscating the tapes the tapes were
never returned these are all real people
that are apparently talking now I also
know that one of them one of the nights
in question when it comes to where
they&#39;re beings a small object appeared
near the perimeter of our EF wot not far
from our base of course they had higher
security because the IRA threat at that
time a Royal Air Force police dog
handler canine team was doing perimeter
patrol where the dogs went flat down on
the ground these people were talking now
when they saw these two beings near the
fence line prodding it next to a
triangular object prodding the fence
with these light like objects when they
saw the RAF dog handlers they fled
toward this machine that took off and
headed off toward our base there was
something very strange in the whole
region there was Tracking&#39;s the tapes
were taken when people asked about the
film and photographs there&#39;s
confirmation this Anna story I came up
with captain mike verano verifies on the
cable news network program UFO the
Bentwaters incidents from 1985 that
indeed he drove the Wing Commander
Gordon Williams the
next morning to an awaiting F 15 or 16 I
don&#39;t know it was available at that time
that we didn&#39;t have on the base that
flew and specifically opened the pilot
opened the canopy they had a satchel in
he said I asked Gordon Williams what do
you have in there and he said I have
actual mote film we have actual film and
photographs of the UFO Gordon Williams
personally handled this material in a
satchel to the pilot the canopy closed
ie quote/unquote says I on the program
by the way I asked where the film was
going and I was told Germany that was
Air Force command at that time from
there we know that there was a paper
trail that it was eventually sent off
back to Washington back line that way I
was an honorably discharged security
policeman I have an honorable discharge
I&#39;ve heard a lot of nasty things said
about me but I have my records the only
reason I have my records is because I
was advised to take steal some of them
by an Air Force colonel or copy them
because he said they would vaporize he
said they&#39;re going to fireproof you I
don&#39;t know what that means
and I was looked at almost like a Frank
Serpico kind of guy I was not a team
player because I was talking everyone
but he looked at me there&#39;s a guy that
should have no knowledge and we going
what are you talking about your own
cracker what on drugs or whatever and he
like this you&#39;re going to learn there&#39;s
nothing you can do about it
so why push it my friend Alabama went
able a wall - uh back to O&#39;Hare Airport
was captured by the FBI they&#39;re
intercepted returned to duty immediately
all he wanted to do was go home he was
put back on flight I was riding with the
Senior Master Sergeant our vehicle
patrol just totally depressed with
everything when Alabama : is a real
person call down radio and said he was
going to kill himself even good see his
go home and this guy turned the pickup
truck quick and was heading toward the
Posey said you stay on the goddamn radio
and all this and there were units
I saw the units across the flight line
responding and everything I never hear
mr. Hult comment on this at all and
that&#39;s why I won&#39;t stand with me in a
place because I bring up things
that maybe they feel bad about as he
says the airforce were on the sidelines
for at all but he had a GI you and of
short m16 and them in the mouth and took
the top of his head off his first time I
ever saw death violent death at 19 and
at they all this did we were different
as night baby in this kid you know his
the South I was the North iver
irreligious I respect that but not
income it was a nice guy and his they
did not do anything to help us a calling
psychiatrist that played head games are
you having any dreams dreams was so
important however we were talking to on
these phones what are your dreams do you
or do feel compulsions to do anything
you have to tell us and it is dangerous
not to tell us so I went to go back in
the air for saying well maybe I&#39;ll do
something else everything was great
it all began suddenly saying with the
guy that put me in he goes Larry I got
bad news for you he goes like this we
can&#39;t touch you their computers at that
time word processes would come up when
you put my information and do not
process nothing follows I talked to
their off in Glens Falls recruiting
station the senior master sergeant that
ran it and he&#39;s and I said guys I got to
tell you what happened I told him the
thing - beings and all and they said
like this Larry you can&#39;t surprise
military people with this and I&#39;m with
you it goes like this you&#39;re never going
to get back in you&#39;re more of a threat
inside than outside because I&#39;ll tell
you to give it up right now what got me
even more bad and they basically said we
can&#39;t go further I went they showed me
do not process them like this can&#39;t be
I&#39;m honorably discharged but except by
reenlistment code and I asked you to
check this out is a for em now you think
it means medical there was no such
existing code on the books and even
Charles Holt said I&#39;ve never heard of it
but it has a lot of pull for EM it does
not mean a medical thing I got to
Connecticut and my father was my
father&#39;s Lawrence weren&#39;t he was a
highly-placed executive and American
industry decent man a friend has a
golfing buddy was the commander of the
Connecticut National Guard he said you
why because I was looking for help
ecology this I&#39;ll take you out to this
guy named dick and he&#39;ll get you he said
well if you want to do that
we went out now this is a friend of my
father&#39;s he said oh no problem not
telling about anything else a few weeks
go by my father runs into him and he
ignored my father he said Larry I can&#39;t
do a thing I have had unbelievable phone
problems for years the typical things we
have all the mail my mail is still
intercepted in this country it was four
years open and resealed with in plastic
with the letters of apology many of our
packages don&#39;t get where they&#39;re going
obviously my passport was coming up for
renewal and I sent it in it was it would
have expired by the time I was coming
but soon after sending it in for a new
one I got a letter back saying mr.
Warren your passport was altered or
mutilated and you need to reapply for
another one I said oh my god what the
hell was that so I just feel like I&#39;ll
find filled it out next response have
all this by the way mr. Warren you must
re-establish US citizenship I&#39;m like
what I&#39;m calling all these people
finally in Portsmouth New Hampshire at
the National passport Center they said
to me this woman I got talking to her
for three weeks and I said she goes I
can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s happening here she
but after I said listen I&#39;m writing a
book called after these gauges the
Bentwaters thinks you happen to be a
person into this but had access she
called she said like this he called me
at this number her home number in
Lebanon New Hampshire called her and she
said the may and I have the official
printout this individual passport is
being revoked under some classification
speaking of sensitive defense issues
public forum foreign soil and then some
coding do decoding under it and there
was n NS C things and all I have it all
and it is just bizarre our agent at that
time Harry Knowlton in New York City was
friends with Ramsey Clark former US
Attorney General you guys know and he
set up a meeting with us and I met with
mr. Clark in person Peter first sent my
letter outlining our work and
we&#39;re trying to do what I&#39;ve been
through and he said Kenan now I was a
make meeting this guy anyway and he said
to me cuz I&#39;m going to make some phone
calls for you but I&#39;m going to tell you
this after knowing everything in his
opinion I think you&#39;d really stand a
1-up sure he would he&#39;s very decent man
because I did a lot of did bunkers try
to say well it was because you talked
about nuclear weapons that&#39;s all in a
low-level action
well mr. Clark said he goes people in
England suspected there were nukes there
all the time he goes I will tell you
this your passport was suspended because
of the other things you&#39;ve talked about
and he wouldn&#39;t elaborate any more he
made two phone calls and the Department
of State with apology said it was an
error we&#39;ve tried to do our best I&#39;d be
willing to speak and swear to this in
everything in front of any congressional
body of great respect for my country and
I think it is the people&#39;s right to know
and a lot of guys suffered through this
and I am an advocate for the witnesses
from other civilizations that it
behooves us in case some of these people
in the future or now should turn hostile
to find out who they are where they come
from and what they want this should be
the subject of rigorous scientific
investigation and not the subject of
rubbishing by tabloid newspapers
