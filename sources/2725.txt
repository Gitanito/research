Introduction
T H E hieroglyphic inscriptions on the temples of
•*• Egypt, though in existence for centuries, re*
ni;iincd a mystery to modern man until the discovery
and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone which became
a key to their meaning. The Rosierucian Carder,
though in active existence for centuries, is also not
known to some persons, institutions, or organiza-
tions as it should be, because of the lack, heretofore,
of a concise work referring to its objects, practices,
and history. A number of recognized literary ref'
crencc sources, such as the encyclopedias, refer to
the organization, but they are not always available
and it is for this reason that this brochure is pre'
pared. It is hoped that it will also be a key to the
solution of any mysteries which, it may seem to
some, surround the world wide activities of the
Rosierucian Order.
This brochure has been published with an appre'
ciation of the need of editors, publishers, authors,
and research workers, for brief, relevant facts per'
taining to the subject of T h e Rosicrucians. There'
fore, all unessential information has been deleted
and left for elaboration to the larger bound works
on the subject. For further convenience, this hro'

PART ONE
What Are the Rosicrucians?
v
Nature of the Organization
The Rosicrucian Order is, broadly, a world-wide
fraternal organization, established and operating on
a lodge system. It expounds a system of meta­
physical and physical philosophy intended to awaken
the dormant, latent faculties of the individual where­
by he may utilize to a better advantage his natural
talents and lead a more useful and happy life. It
accomplishes this end by a method of personal in­
struction and guidance. The member is taught the
significance and application of the Cosmic and nat­
ural laws which are found manifest in the universe
around him and in himself. It unites into one
liv a b le p h ilo s o p h y , metaphysical idealism and such
practical sciences as physics, chemistry, biology,
physiology, and psychology. It also seeks, by its
educational campaign, to rid society of the enslav­
ing influence of superstition.
The Order, throughout the world, is divided
into jurisdictions, in each of which there are
established Grand Lodges with temples of instruc­
tion. The Supreme Temple for the North and
South American jurisdiction is located in San Jose.
California. (For history, see page S.)
What Does the Name Mean?
The word "Rosicrucian” is the Anglicized form
of the original Latin name of the Order Rosae
Crucis, which means of the rosy cross. The name
is derived from the Orders centuries-old symbol-—
the cross and a single red rose. Although the sym­
bol consists ol a cross, it has no sectarian or strictly
religious significance, but an allegorical meaning
ol its own.
"Rosicrucian" is pronounced: Ro'-zi-kru'-shan.
[ 4]
The initials. A. M. O. R. C., are an abbreviation
of the words, "The Ancient Mystical Order Rosae
Crucis.’ which is the complete name of the Order
throughout the world. In Latin, the full title ol the
Order was originally: Antiijiuur A r c a n u s O r d o R u s a e
R u b e a e ft Auretie C r u e t s . In various lands at vari­
ous times the Order has been known by slightly
dilferent abbreviations ol the original Latin title.
The initials, A. M. O. R. C.. usually following the
popular phrase, The Rosierucian Order, to desig­
nate authenticity.
Is It a Religion?
The Rosierucian Order is absolutely NOT a
religious movement or sect. It is non-sectarian in
every respect. As its membership is world-wide, it
of course includes persons o f e v e r y c r e e d and de­
nomination. as does any other world-wide fraternity
of a cultural nature. Many leading clergymen of
Protestant denomination, rabbis, and priests arc
members: but tile Order itscll. in the past and at
present, is fr e e o f religious a llia n c e s . Although its
ethics adhere to the principles of Christianity, its
must not be considered a religious movement or a
Christian sect. Tlu- teachings and philosophical
doctrines of the Order do not interfere with the
religious freedom of its members.
Is It a Commercial Enterprise?
The Supreme Grand Lodge of the AMORC (The
Rosierucian Order) is incorporated in the State of
California, and its subordinate bodies are incor­
porated elsewhere, as a n u n - p r o fit c o r p o r a t io n . None
of the funds of the Order enure to the personal
benefit of any officer or member. There are no
stock- or share-holders, and all funds of the Order
arc held in trust to further its purposes which arc
defined by its Constitution and Statutes. The Fed­
eral Department ol Internal Revenue of the United
States, the State of California, and the Dominion
of Canada, recognise the non-profit status of the
Rosierucian Order by exempting it from the pay­
ment of income tax.

What Does It Teach?
An individual listing of tile subjects included in
the membership curriculum would be too lengthy
fur the space provided here. In main, it includes
such topics as the mysteries of time and space: the
human consciousness; the nature ol matter; per­
fecting the physical body: the effect ol light, color
and sound upon mind: the ancient philosophies:
the development ol w ill: human emotions, instincts,
and their relation to personality: important dis­
coveries in Rosicruoian chemistry and physics: ex­
planation of the phenomena of intuition, etc., etc.
The organization maintains an extensive editorial
and research department composed of men and
women of its membership who arc authorities in
specialized fields of science and literature, as well
as being well versed in Rosicrucianism. The in­
structions arc either delivered orally in temples of
the Order to the memhers, or sent privately to them
in manuscript lorm. The subjects are accompanied
by experiments which the memhers must conduct in
order to remove the material from the realm of
theory and make it entirely practical and applicable,
by demonstration, to his or her personal life. Highly
speculative, fantastic, or improbable subject matter
is n o t included in the teachings of th e R o s i c r u e ia n f .
Who May Become Members?
Any law-abiding citizen of either sex and over
twenty-one years of age, of good repute and having
a firm conviction in a Supreme Being, is eligible
for membership in the Grand Lodge of the Rosicru-
eian Order regardless of creed or financial status.
Thus, the o r g a n iz a t io n includes in its membership
a cross section of all classes ot peoples. Its mem­
bership includes humble manual laborers seeking to
better themselves, and also prominent business men.
directors of industries, physicians, attorneys, sci­
entists. artists, editors, educators, and authors, who
find the teachings stimulating and very livable.
Those desiring membership may write to the
Rosicruoian Order at its Grand Lodge in San Jose.
California, requesting free literature which fully ex­
plains membership and its benefits.
What Rosicrucians are NOT
v
Not Affiliated with Freemasonry,
Theosophy or Any Other Organization
The Rosicrucian Order (AMORG) has always
been and IS an independent Order. It never was
and is not sponsored by or a part of any other
movement, society, or organization. It has at times
during the centuries of its existence entered into a
federation of orders or fraternities of like nature,
but it has never submerged its individuality in such
a federation or forfeited its independent functioning.
Regardless of the similarity some persons may believe
exists between the honorable b'reemasonic Order
and the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC), there is.
in fact, no relationship between the two orders.
Does Not Teach Astrology, Fortune Telling
The Rosicrucian Order docs not teach, indorse,
or practice astrology, fortune telling, crystal gazing,
numerology, or any other past or present supersti­
tions. or similar popular pseudo-scientific practices.
Furthermore, it neither teaches, practices, nor recom­
mends spiritualism or hypnotism.
N o Strange Practices or Rites
Rosicucianism makes no demands upon its mem­
bers that would obligate them to conduct themselves
in any manner that would bring them incu public
ridicule or condemnation. The members are not
required to dress, cat, or act any differently than
would be expected of any intelligent and morally
responsible man or woman in the conduct ot Ins
or her ordinary affairs. The members resort to no
practices or rites which in any sense are injurious
to health, family relationships, or morals.
m
History of the Rosicrucians
v
Traditional History
Traditionally, the Rosicrucian Order traecs its
origin to the m y s te r y s c h o o ls o r secret schools ol
learning established during the reign of Thutinose
111, about 1500 B. C., in Egypt. Though he de­
voted himself seriously to an investigation ol "the
mysteries"— in other words, natural phenomena-
Thulmose 111 still clung to the ancient religions of
the period. His descendant. Ainenhotep IV, 13 55
B C., known as the heretic king, also became leader
of the mystery schools: but, being extremely pro­
gressive, he abolished the polytheistic religions of
the time to advance in their stead the world's first
doctrine o f m o n o t h e is m . The Rosicrucians lo o k
upon Amcnhotep IV as their traditional first Grand
Master.
From Egypt, the secret teachings nl the brother­
hood spread into Greece, and thence into Rome.
During the Middle Ages they were concealed under
a variety of different names.
Chronological Records
Chronologically, the Order is mentioned as far
back as 1115 A. D., in a hook of the collection of
Brother “ Omnis Mariar” in Germany. It rose to
considerable prominence during the Sixteenth Cen­
tury when, following the invention of the printing
press, a small pamphlet entitled “ The Fama Fra-
ternitatis” was issued and given wide circulation.
It was said to have been written by a theologian,
Johonn Valentine Andrea ( 1586-1654). The pam­
phlets were part of a campaign for its revival. The
Order first came to America in 1694. locating in
what is now Fairmotint Park, Philadelphia.
For a detailed history of the Order, refer to the
fourteenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica:
current edition of the Encyclopedia Americana:
New Standard Encyclopedia: and “ Rosicrucian Ques­
tion? and Answers with Complete History of the
Order." by Dr. H. Spencer Lewis, available in
public libraries.

Theatre of the Sky," because it presents the greatest
drama of all the ages, the mythological traditions
and Cosmic roles of the planets and stars, revealing
their surprising astronomical mysteries and giving
young and old a clearer conception of the wonders
of the heavens.
The foyer of the Planetarium building houses a

The Institution Behind
The Organization
v
Integrity
The Rosicrucian Order (AMORC) is proud to
refer inquiries as to its administrative practices to
the San Jose, California, Chamber of Commerce.
The organisation in its present form has been
established in the United States for several decades
and enjoys an enviable reputation in whatever com­
munity its branches or headquarters arc located.
It jealously guards its ancient landmarks and customs
which keep its administrative conduct above re­
proach .
Foundation and Stability
The ability of the Rosicrucian OrJcr to nialft good
on its promises to provide members with certain
study material, and to perform the various services
and provide the facilities held out to them, is pos­
sible because o f th e in s t it u t io n behind the orguni-
sation. It owns the real property upon which its
buildings stand, and there arc no outstanding obli­
gations against either its real or its chattel property.
Financially, the Rosicrucian Order is quite capable
of meeting any obligation it assumes.
