I was very well-known as her child and she would let me 'run around' backstage and to and from the concession stands. One evening before the show, she gave me some change for popcorn, but I had this horrible habit of putting things in my mouth - like change. Subsequently, I accidently swallowed a nickel and it closed off my esophagus. I started to choke and a crowd gathered. They called for the on-site emergency medical technician team and when they arrived my lips were blue and I had not breathed for several minutes.

I distinctly remember myself (my body) hovering above the scene that was taking place below. My vision was in black and white and there was no bright light or light at the end of the tunnel. I could draw you a picture of exactly where I was lying right now to this day without question. The emergency medical technician did not extract the nickel - but my mom had now arrived and before the emergency medical technician could perform the tracheotomy needed, my mom pounded on my back like a mad woman and the coin came flying out.

I believe now that I have a very heightened sense of awareness and I am an extremely intuitive person. I know beforehand (from a fleeting image in my mind) just before something is about to happen and I can 'read' a person in a matter of minutes from meeting them, if that makes sense. There is more, but this is just a small example of what kind of person that I believe I have become from my NDE experience.
