 11/1, September 1901-1914(?)  16 pp., $1.00-$2.00 a year.

  From the repetition of volume numbers, the journal seems to have had a hiatus and then been started again.  It consisted almost entirely of Gaze's sermons and addresses on Life Culture, Invincible Mentality, Perpetual Efficiency, clippings on his lecture tours, and physical immortality ("Old age is a disease caused by a lack of co-operation with the laws of change and growth. This disease can be prevented or even cured by proper methods"), bulked out with advice on healthful diets (preferably fruitarian) and the like.  The journal carried few advertisements  (The Order of Christian Mystics, a vegetarian cafeteria in Los Angeles, etc.) but all of the "valuable works for Life Culturists" advertised, except for Gaze's own How to Live Forever, were by Alice B. Stockham. It prominently featured Gaze's Church of the New Thought and School of Life Culture, with Sunday services by Gaze and daily healing by Mrs. Florence Hewitt Callender.  Advertised in Humanitarian Review, February 1903.  On Gaze see the note under Physical Immortality.  INTA.     Issues:Life Culture V4 N1 Sep 1904 Life Culture V1 N6 Jun 1914      </p>
