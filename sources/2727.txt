The songs in this book are dedicated in
Eternal Loving Gratitude to the Ascended Mas­
ters, asan opening for the Music of the Spheres
from Their Octave of Life, to come into the
physical use of all who want the Constructive
Way of Life.
We trust that through these humble efforts
the New Music may come through to heal the
people, bring harmony, prosperity arid joy to
every human being on earth; and to release the
Victory of the Light for the Blessing and Free­
dom of all.
F O R E WORD
T
HE Ascended Masters ask all under this Radiation to
keep all the Music and Decrees bright and happy in a
rapid tempo. Then, the energy released goes forth charged
with a quality which the Ascended Ones can use, amplifying
it with the intensity and power needed to produce Perfect re­
sults.
The Music and Decrees should all be sent forth through
a joyous FEELING, consistent with clearness of speech, Per­
fect unison and good rhythm. They should be kept dignified
and powerful, yet charged with an enthusiasmand Lovewhich
is the release of the Mighty Power and Victory from the Oc­
tave of Light.
The Ascended Masters have requested the students to use
ONLY the songs in this book in all their activities under this
Radiation, asthrough them a uniform activityisbeingbrought
about, to act throughout America and the world. The reason
for holding to these melodies isthe same asthat forthe Study
Group Outlines, until certain work isaccomplished for Amer­
ica’s protection.
Every time one of these songs is sung by the students, a
definite quantity of energy and substance rises into the at­
mosphere, qualified harmoniously and having definite form
and color. It is taken up by the Ascended Masters, charged
with Their Ascended Master Consciousness, Feeling, Quali­
ties, Power and Light. It is then expanded, intensified, ampli­
fied and consciously directed by Them, to render some
very definite Service for America and all mankind. It is
many, many times used to dissolve discord, to heal, to harmo-
r
nize, to protect and to strengthen all constructive activities.
All original music will be brought forth by the Saint
Germain Press at the earliest possible moment and notification
will be given in the Voice of the "I AM.”
The Ascended Masters never use any kind of slowdragging
music, nor any melody which contains the feeling of sadness
or suffering. Those are records of discord which the Ascended
Masters cannot and will not use.
We thank all whose music or lyrics have been used inthis
song-book,and we enfold them in the Mightiest Blessingfrom
the "I AM Presence” and the Ascended Masters, as wellas
ourselves. We call forth every good thing without limit to
Hoodthem and their worlds, until there is not room to receive
the blessing poured out.
We understand that, all who have contributed lyrics or
music herein used have given them unconditionally, as aglad
free gift of Love to the Saint Germain Press, to be used inthe
Service of the Light/as that is the ONLY CONDITION on
which we ever accept anything in this Ascended Master Ac­
tivity.
We wish to thank Mr. C. C. Birchard of Boston for the
use of several numbers and wherever possible use his "Twice
55 NewBrown Book” arrangement of melodies given, asthey
areinthekeysmostsuitedto large audiences.

Once again we feel Thee near,

In the Cause we now engage
Ushering in the Golden Age.

Always ready at our call,
Striving to illumine all.
Helping us to understand,
That our Freedom is at hand.
In the Presence we abide
As we walk close at Thy Side.
Thou dost always us inspire
To blaze up the Violet Fire,
That we purified may be,
And ASCENDED, soon, like Thee.

Great Divine Director of humanity,
All the world shall render praises unto Thee.
Bright Celestial Envoy sent from out the Sun,
Thou art with the God-head, ever joined in One.
Through Thy Master Powers’ Full Activity,
Guide and guard our Nation’s blessed Destiny.
Banish from her Children, thoughts of time and space,
Strong Walls of protection, ’round her boundaries

Great Divine Director, in this Cosmic Hour,
Thou dost stand triumphant in Majestic Power.
To Thy Holy Presence, Universes bow,
Yet Thou dost enfold us in Thine Own Love now.

When our True Awak’ning comes.

Oromasis, Oromasis,
Prince of the Fiery Elements,
O’er all the earth release Thy Flame,
Emblazon all in Thy Light’s Name.
Through Angels of the Violet Fire
Release the help we do require;
These Angels hasten at Thy Call
To give Thy Fire of Love to all.

(Melody: ALOHA OE) Key of A
I feel my God Flame touch my brow,
The Breath of Love— eternal now,
I raise my eyes and Lo! I see,
My own Great God Self over me. 4
A Dazzling Cloud envelops all,
I hear my Real God Presence call! ‘
I feel a surge of Love’s Great Might,
I enter deep Its Breath— Its Light.
I see within this Pulsing Flame,
I listen and hear my Secret Name!
I feel the Glow— the Great Flame Breath,
"I AM” the Victor over death!
I stand forth free— ASCENDED NOW!
To my Heart’s Light all things do bow:
”1AM” a Being of Cause alone,
And that Cause Love— the Sacred Tone!
I pour out Life— I lift, I raise,
My Heart o’erflows and sings Its praise;
My Power strengthens and inspires,
My Great Light Rays are God’s Own Fires.
"I AM” a Sun! My Love Its Light!
All else grows dim— earth lost to sight: t
I know that "I AM ” GOD— the ONE!
The Source! the Great, Great Central Sun!

OriginalWords and Music published by Saint Germain Press)
I dwellin the H eart of My Presence,
I breathe in Its Breath of Light;
I hold Its Blest H and in mine always,
I live alone in Its Height.
So Radiant, so Real and Resplendent,
In Glory all dazzling bright;
MI AM” clothed in Its own Pure Substance,
Its clear blazing Ess’nce of Light.
I call to the hearts of earth’s children,
I sing with the Voice of Peace;
I give ALL the Love of my Being,
That discord ever may cease.
So come and abide with me always,
And visit these Temples bright;
They are HOM E, blessed ones so precious,
Your Home and my Home of LIGHT!

(Melody—Original:published bySaint Germain Press)
Tonight, I wearmy Robe of Light,
My Crown of Love and Sunshinehair;
I wield my Scepter of God's Might
And all obeys me everywhere.
I wear God’sJewel,His Di’mond Heart
And through It pours Love’s own BrightRay;
I liftmy wings unfurled to heav’n
And human clouds are cleared away.
I live within my Realm of Light
Its CitadelisLove’s Great Tower;
I know all thingsand bless all things
The "I AM” is my Mighty Power.

Dedicated to Me. Nada Raybom

(Published by Saint Germain Press)
I come on the Wings of Light, dear hearts,
On the wings of a radiant morn.
The Love of my Being floods forth in full joy
Likethe glorious burst of the dawn.
All glorious and blazing, all dazzling and clear,
All radiant resplendent and bright,
The Love of my Great Cosmic Presence goes forth
To enfold all the earth in Its Light.
I come on the Wings of Light, dear ones,
On Light that has substance and form.
On Pinions that blaze as a rainbow bright
My Love to the whole earth is borne.
On song I come winging, in melody singing,
In harmonies lovely and rare,
I come as a Force, from the Infinite Source,
On Wings I speed on through the air.
I come on the Wings of Light, Oh earth!
On the "Light of the World” I ride.
On my outspread Pinions of God’s own Light
"I AM ” and do abide. "I AM” and do abide.
