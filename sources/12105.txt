  		              		Experience Description   

    I was age 15 and  having an operation. 
  
  During anesthesia, I went into another state of existence and I was at home there. I was floating in a long pink tunnel that was twisting in different directions.  I was  flying forward and feeling  total bliss and Happiness.  All the life here on earth was like a dream, long time ago, that did not mean much. 

  Then I remember seeing an operating light and realizing that I was still alive.  I was very annoyed and frightened that I had to go back to my body. When I  slowly woke up, I was  stressed out and asking people to let me go back because I did not want to be here in this life. Eventually, I had like a switch and I was more here on earth and actually frightened to go to tunnel. I was holding people's hands and asking them to hold me here. I thought that it was drug effect for years until I read a book by Raymond Moody called, 'Life after life'. 

  The experience in a different reality was so real that  it changed my worldly perception. I am not afraid of death at all. I am still not sure what I am doing here on earth and if I get the chance to go back home, I would go in a second. But I guess there is a reason for everything. Once you go there, you cannot forget it. After my experience,  I was not able to wear any watches as they would stop or show wrong time.  This happened with even the most expensive watches, until I had my i-watch that is working ok now. I have lots of vivid movie dreams. I was experimenting with my dreams for a while trying to control their content. It was like having dreams in dreams, but I do not have much time to do this now.
