24 Human Pe1"tJonality. [Oct. 29,
And. furthennore, I suggest that while we habitually use our ainiatro-
cerebral character-centres with the same unconscious choice as leads us, for
instance, to catch a rope Hung at us with ollr right hand and not with
our left, there are nevertheless certain statea-supemormal as well as ab-
nonnal-in which our Ego (whatever that may be) expreaaea itself more
readily tlu-ough the dextro-cerebral centres, and aaaumea, therefore, a com-
paratively savage character.
H this be so, much light will be thrown on almost all that claaa of
Spiritualistic manifestations which have been ascribed to diabolic agency.
And if we are not ashamed of poaaesaing a digestive system which includes
the rudimentary "vermifonn appendix,"-a motor system which includes the
comparatively defective motor innervation of our left bands,-then surely
we need not be ashamed of poaaesaing an emotional and ideational system
which includes dextro-cerebral elements some twenty generations or so in
arrear of the epoch to which our bmin, taken as a whole, entitles us to
belong. For those who believe that our evolution has no aaaignable limit,
there may even be something pleasing in such a token as this of the rapidity
with which we are mounting on the endless way.
