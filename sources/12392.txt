I sat down on a bench on the street and then my arms went numb. I knew right away, what was happening. I ran into a store and they called 911 for me. As I was waiting for the ambulance, I was very frightened and prayed that I did not want to die. Once I was on the stretcher and in the ambulance, I could feel a presence and I was no longer scared. At the hospital, I went into ventricular tachycardia and passed out. Immediately I went through a tunnel. It looked like I was flying a million miles an hour through fireworks. I felt no fear, only peace. I then remember being resuscitated and waking up from a very peaceful infinite void. Once I was stabilized and in my room I received a message that I did not meet the being of light because 'I needed to figure out some things for myself, and the answers would not be just handed to me.'
