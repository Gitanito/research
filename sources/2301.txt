PREFACE.
Tms Pamphlet has been put together in n. hasty manner, as
a reply to a series of profe$sional attacks, decrying the \ Vater
Cure as an imposition, and all who practice it as impostors.
In so far as it may be considered a per~onal defence, I have
entered upon it with unwillingne;;s, and in deference to the
wishes and opinions of others. I have come into court with
witnci!Ses, and the reader i · at liberty tn cro :o:-qnestion them,
while I claim the priYilcge granted to per::son::; 1.mder such cir-
cumstances:-the pri\'ile!!·e of speaking in my own defence.
To account for the ~tylc in which the pamphlet is written, I
may remark that it b intended for non-profec::~ional persons,
although I am pcr.-uadcd that if medical men would take the
trouble to read the:,c page~, they would find facts, which it
would be worth their while to consider, albeit they are not
clothed in a lean1c•l dre83.
Popular works on the art of healing a-re considered infra
dignitatis, but I may be allowed to think profe;:,:-;ional dignity,
-even suppo~ing it infringed upon-to be of secondary con·
sidcration in thio matter, ~ccing that !t will not assi~t in res·
toring a shattered con~titution: make a man lsn ppy in the pos-
sessinn of sound dig~t:;tive orQ'ans, cure gout and rheumatism,
or prevent apoplexy and consumption.
To write on the ' Vater Cure for medical men alone, would,
' t the present moment, be a w~te of good ink and paper ; in
•
lV P.KEfAC£..
this I was confirmed by s. recent visit from an old medical friend,
whose first complimentary question was, "'Veil, arc you here
still, and is there really something in the Water Cure?" I
asked if he had not had the curiosity to read any of the works
written on t11e subject ; " Not a syllable," was his reply. In
the lllCantime the multitude are suffering, and to a great ex-
tent unnecessarily, under a variety of diseases, an~ if medical
men will not inquire for them, they shall have the opportunity
of inquiring for themselves. Facts are simple as well as stub-
born things, and they can be well understood by persons to
whom their rationale cannot be fully explained.
In addition to the statement of cases,-to show that I am not
solitary in some of my opinions, I have introduced those of
several eminent English practitioners. I have also thought it
advisable to give a sketch of the history of the Water Cure,
with an account of the processes used in the treatment, and
some explanation of the ma.nner in which they act on the hu-
man body. If this volume should have the effect of producing
in the reader even a slight interest in this important subject,
ny first object will have been gained.

THE
PRACTICE OF THE WATER CURE.
lllSTORY OF PRIESSNITZ, AND THE INTRODUC.
TION OF THE \VATER CURE.
THE name of Priessni.tz may already be said to belong to
history: it is a name that may now be heard in almost every
town in Europe, coupled with the grateful remembrance of
those who have experienced the health-re:-.toring powers of the
'Vater Cure, or who have learnt from this method how to avoid
suffering. Gifted with the moral and physical attributes of
men of genius and talent, this originally "humble countryman"
has providentially been so placed and surrounded by circum-
stances, as to work out a great and lasting sy:,tem of treatment,
for preventing, alleviating, and curing diseases; and genera-
tions yet unbo!~ 'Xi!! reap the benefits of the steady untiring
labors, the undeviating honesty and temperance. and the crea-
tive genius of the peasant philosopher of Graefenberg. How
well and appropriately does the motto apply to him, "In nulla
re hominem ad Deos homines accednnt, quam salutem homini·
bus dando." l\Inst truly, man cannot approar.lt more nearly to
the beneficent Creator, than hy Tcstor ng the health or afford-
ing relief to his fellow-creature~.
By entering into some brief details vf the slow and progres·
sive mode in which the '\-Vater Cure was con~tructed, and b)
relating some of his sayings and doings, you will be able tc
form some opinion of this extraordinary person. It is thirty
years since he commenced using water as a remedy, and he is
now fvrty-nine years old. His birth-place was on the moun·
T H E P It A C T I C E 0 F'
tain called GraefenberO'. a )Out a mile above the little town or
villa o-c of Friwaltlau
0
in Austrian Silesia. J3cfore he wa.s
twctrt\' he wa8 called ~pan to manage the small farm on which
his faini}y lived, in conseq.uence of the S~IU~en IJ}indne:::S of his
father. \Vith rcgnrd to lm; appl'arancc, 1t Js that of a resp.ec-
tablc fa.nnf'r, who if it were nece:=;sary would not be above takmg
an hour's ~alutary cxerci:m at the plough. He ~tands about
five feet E.'ight. and is stiff in hi~ carriage; although 8trong,
robuc;t, anti hcalthv, looks lllUCh older than he i~, and care-worn.
He is capable o( crrea.t e.:\ertion, and from the last twenty-six
years his only bcv;rage has been water. l\Io~t of his obf-ierva-
tions are dictated by reflection and ~OHHd common :::.cn::5e, but
he is resen·c·tl to a 'rault, and talks as little as he by po~sibility
can. !lis motin.• for carrying his taciturnity so far, is to avoid
fatio·ne autl excitement; being aware of his highly nervous
temperament, he has cultivated the habit as a means of tran-
quillity, in the midst of the never-ceasing occupation and tur-
moil caused by the great nmnber of patients by whom he is
surrounded. That ~nch i~ his moth·e. i:-: shown by an obser-
vation that he made, viz., '·if I had talked as mueh as people
wished and expected, I should ha\'C lt:t\'C been a patient my8elf,
or perhaps dead long ago.'' Thi i · likP-ly enough, when it is
consitlered that he is engaged from six in the morning uutil
ten at night, and ha:o; barely had a clay's relaxation for twenty
years.
The first idea he obtained of the healing: power of pnre wa-
ter, it b said, was from a man in !'orne neighboring iron-works,
who used it in diftcrent way::; for burns and injuries. He wa~
at once struck with its superiority to oily aud grl'asy applica-
tions, and that there wns t'Omcthing morP to be done with so
potent a remedy. His <tttcntion hccame fixed on the subject,
and from it }JC began to retlcct ou health and disea~c. In
doing this he tirst. remarked that the ploughman with hi~ rud-
dy face and bare feet. dirl not complain of ~tomach-ache or
headache. or of the delicacy of his nerves. that·· he w!Ji~1led as
he went for want of thonglit,, anti ~eemcrl perfectly unar.quaint~
cd with what, in a refined state of ::;oei(•ty: i.;; r·a11etl Pimui,
anxiety, or the blue d-Is. And moreover, that after haYinrr
been wetted to the ::;kin for hours. he diu not ~hiver or take cold~
Again, he oh:;crvcd indiYiduals of another complPxion. who for
years had ,rrouc throngh all the rlbsipations of Vienna, or who
had passed a studio11s life m warm ro0ms. He a.h;o obsetTcd
the dairymaid. the scmpl"trC:::>S: and the fine lady \Yho seldom
wa1ks. From the striking contra::;ts observable between all
THE \\'ATER CUfl£,
these jndiYidual:-., he furmeu his fh;:-,t notions of life= health, and
disea"e. He cmuml·twed bb practice by lr('ating the injuries
and slight ailmenb of hi::; nl'ighbon~; applying his compresse3
warm or cold, according· to the state of intlanunation or other
:symptoms. To this he s~1ou added sponging difihcnt part::;, and
sonll'times the whole body with water, rccommcndin~ plain diet
and drinking water at the same time. In the mid~t of this he
met with a ~enuus accident. A heavy wno-S!_on '' ent over him
• e~
and broke several of his ribs, and as the two practitioners of
the village gave him little hope of hb recovery. he took the re·
solution of trying his own plan. He reco\'ercd rapidly, and his
cure, after the unfavorable opinion that had been given, made
a sensation in the neighborhood. .l\Iany now applied to him
for ach·ice, and he was very snccessful in tnany cases. Thig
gave him an opportuuity of studying on n. larger ~cale the phe·
nomena of disea~e and the difterent efiects produced by water,
and h ·soon formetl a theory: and C<'ntrh·ed ne\·; modes of apply-
iug- his remedy to produce the results he required.
The powerful aid of obtaining at "·ill ~o ~nlutary a process
as that of sweating- dwelt on his mind, and his fertile imagina-
tion soon contrived the :;iwple and admirable plan of enveloping
the patient in blanket::;. This an::>wered all hi~ views on that
point, finding that whcu properly used and fi.,llowed by a bath,
it was not attended bv debility; that it relicYed the internal or-
J!ans: and strengthened the :-:kin and the cou~titntional powers.
The Rw;::;ian m•J.le of c::we:1ting- with steam. as well as the
mode by using h•::>:~tetl air for the !'arnC' purpo:--P. he had long be..
fore heard ot~ bu~ he at once dt:tccted the fallacy, and saw that
it went directly again~t the 1ir::lt principles of his sy~tem, hav-
ing the insurmom,table objection. that of wettkening the powers
, ofthe whole skin and ncn-ou::: sp:tem, ami producing only a Ekin-
deep sweating." The following anecdote wil1 ~l10w ltow con-
vinced be is on the point, and that he will h(':tT of no compro-
mi:-.c. Captain Raven, one of his mo...t iutimate frieuds, who
wa~ kind enough to inten··=-t ]Jimsclf in my proceedingti, wi::;hed
him to a5sist me jn tny rc"'earchec; : he replied, '·You remem-
b.,r Dr. - of St. Petersburgh, I devoted myself to him for a
long titne, and l1e went away under~tanding- the Cure; he i8
now, I hear, :;weating- all his patients by npplyiug hot-air to the
skin and lungs:' The Captain observ<•d, "that no doubt he
had the long-established prejudices of the people to conte~d
with that he \\-as obli m!d to f'la\- up to them, and that wa~ h1s

sole reason ;.. then baid Prie:::snitz, " \Vell: then. it is not hon·

opposition to a principle 'vhich he nnderstan~s; he k~.owt~ bet-
ter and I cannot forcrh·e him, or take any mterest m any of
' ~
them again." ..
He was still much puzzled how to treat many of the strtkmg
critical phenomena which take place during the Water treat-
ment, and here it is, that the Water Cure bas gained by his
being thrown on his own resources; had he known how, or had
he been licensed to usc medicines, in many of his dilemmas he
most probably would have had recourse to them, inst~ad of ?nd-
ing out a surer and safer plan of treatment by the atd of dlVer-
sified modes of using water. He was also dissatisfied with his
imperfect plan of treating fevers and inflammations, but by
continued reflection, and like Newton, " en y pensant toujours,'
he arrived at the process of enveloping in the wet sheet-th~
crowning discovery of the Water Cure. With the aid of this
invaluable remedy, he was enabled to graduate and modify his
treatment as he pleased. He soon after discovered its power-
ful and extraordinary effects when used in the treatment of
chronic diseases. The use of the different local baths, and the
douche, had preceded the discovery of the wet sheet.
All this, however, did not go on smoothly or without obsta-
cles and opposition. He was denounced as an unlicensed and
dangerous impostor,-fined, and his treatment suspended. Con-
fident, however, in the goodness of his cause, and backed by nu-
merous patients, he appealed against the sentence, and it was
set aside. Priessnitz and his system of treatment had now be-
come of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the Pa-
ternal Govenunent of Vienna ; and in its anxious care for the
health of its subjects, a commission of medical men was sent to
inquire into the real state of affairs. Fortunately for the \Va-
ter Cure, old B~ron Turkheim, the head of tl:e medical depart-
ment of the empire, was also at the head of tlns} a man celebra-
ted f?r his independent. spirit, hi? great ~earning, and scientific
acqwrement~. He st~Id some tune at Graefenberg, and on his
return to VIenna, bemg at a medical society, he was asked
wha~ he. t~ought of "the new cha:latanism ;" he replied,
" Pr1essrutz 1~ an honest man, and no Impostor; and his mode
of treatment Is more successful than ours; believe me, gentle-
men, you have muc~ to lea.rn from this countryman." This
ma.de the sages of V1~nn~ st1ll more angry and violent against
the. Water Cure. and lts.founcler- .shutting up the avenues of
the1r undcrstandmg a.gam;::t the evidence of their senses. not-
withstanding the accumulated facts which presented them·
THE WATER CURI: .
•elves among their patients, who leaving them with little hope,
returned in perfect health.
The commi~sion analyzed the water to discover its mystic
virtue ! bul they were disappointed to find thnt it was nothintr
more than p1tre spring wate1! The sponges he u~ed wer~
also examined with great care~ to see it' they contained any
secret remedie~. After this Priessnitz threw away the sponge~,
and has never used them since, finding that rub!,iug with hands
- "flesh to flesh"- was better. At t11e time I speak of he was
called the Schwamm, or sponge doctor.
He was now taken under the protection of the Government,
and additional police placed at Friwaldan, to note the number
of patients, and report the deaths and other results of the treat-
ment. 'ro 1841 he had treated 7:219 strangers, and there had
b~en 39 death::;. Some of these I found by the registry had
d1ed before commencing the treatment, and ~ome others wert~
reported in a forlorn state before anything was attempted.
Although Priessnitz is a kind-hearted man, there was a time
when he was not sufficiently philanthropic as to wish that his
mode of treatment ~honld be understood by others, and he ob-
jected to having works \vritten explanatory of its theory and
practice; howC\·er, many small works were published and
widely circulated, and the numbers of hi::; patients \vere in-
c:reased in~tea.d of Lcing diminished, as he expected. The
work that had the greate.:;t cfiect was one by Professor ~Iunde;
this was followed Lv another from the :-:amc author, as a hand-
book on the \Vater ·cure trc:-ttment~ which has ::-ince appeared
in an English dre::s: with :::omc alterations and additions.
The renmvn of the ::)UcceFsful trcatm,mt of disease by the
\Vater Cure, hat! gone on r(Jr some time before Priessnitz had
any imitators, with the exception of I\fr. \Veiss, \Vho was at
that time the farrier of the village. At the commencement of
Priessnitz's career, \Vci~:3 and he had ~omcllaing to do together,
but they soon disagreed, and have been at enmity for many
years.
Pricssnitz has had eight children, the fir:-.t was a boy, those
that followed all girls. There is an intcre~ting fact con-
rwctecl \vith this which I shall relate. \Vhcn first married his
wife had no great faith in the \Vater Cure; in truth, it wns
then in a rude state, she therefore in::;isteu that the first child-
the boy- should be treated in the ordinary way; this he pro-
mised, and when it was attacked with measles, the practition-
ers of the village were called :n, but it died. All the other chiJ-

Prir .... ~ . i' z :;·w that f'lJC had ncyer had a moments ~pprchen810ll
aLout thl:tH. • Thi:-~ fact certainly does not tell agaml::it the \Va.
ter Cure. I \vas present during the treatment of one of his
children in fever. The child being fi·01n home hau teen neg-
lected anu when brouo-ht home had severe fever with delirium i
on th~ third day it ,;as convalescent, and carried out in tl1e
muse's arms. Another of his children was very delicate from
its infancy, and snpposed to have been in~ectcd by an i.mpuro
nurse his wife having been prevented nursmg. It was nckety,
and there appeared little prospect of its livi nP." : this child was
two years under a regular system of water o·eatmcnt, and when
I left Grufenberg had nearly recovered, and promised to be a
fine healthy child. On several occasions during this long pe-
riod a crisis had taken place of a remarkable nature. During
ten months that I observed the child, the changes in its consti-
tution and appearance were very marked, and there was every
evidence of its growing up to be strong and healthy. .l\Irs.
Pricssnitz, after her last confinement, had a severe attack of
childbed fever, induced by the excitement of being visited fm
several dnys after her confinement by a number of ladies of
rank. She was enveloped repeatedly in the sheet, followed Ly
a tepid bath-: and the fe\'er \\'as completely remo\·ed in t,,-o tlays.
Priessnitz ob::;en·ed, " Our enemies can do us but little harm,
it's our friends "ho kill us;:' referring. I dare say, to fea:::.ting
and drinking companion:->~ as \Yc·ll as to ]tis wife·s case. Some
year:=; before this, and before his reputation was established, he
wonlt.! go an~ dist.ance to treat n.. patient; he went, not being
well at the ttme, man open car, m the depth of an almo~t Si·
berian winter, to visit a patient in a dbtant villacre; he was
then req nested to go on fnrther, so that by the timebhe reached
home late at night, his lower limbs were frozen. The next
day his legs were swollen, accompanied with fever and inflam-
mation in the s!ornach .and .uowclf:l. After some prclimjnary
~reatment, he satd to Ius Wife, '' I mnst now go immediately
mto the ~Jwll?w bath, anti be rubbed, or I shall be laid up with
a dan~·erous Illness, perhaps a fatal one ; do you see that it is
proper1y ~hme, and the prope~· effect vroduccd before I get out."
H~ remamed sever~! hours m the bath, two bath servants car-
rymg on the ablution, and rubbing without intermi$sion until
the circulaticm was equalized. Two hours after the bath a
profus~ spontaneous perspiration set in, and the next day he
was wttho~t a symptom of anything wrong, and feelin~ only

very weak and tired. 18 it then to IYJ \rondercd at, that he
shoulJ hare snch confidence him.::elf in the remedi:1l power~ of
water. cr that his patient-,, \\hen they sec ~imilar re~nlts frc·
qucntly takiwr placr-, ..:hould IJ:o inspired with the same feeling?
'rhc- lollowin!.!· f.tct. and I conhl rdate mauy bimilar ones, will
show. that lte b not without ome kindnf'-;::; ami !!Cnero-.itv. A
Pru~sian lieutemmt, abont thirty year~ olJ, came to cou uit J1im,
with exten...irc disea:,.c (carie~) of'the hone::; or the tlligh and hip.
On hi~ arri\'al, I wa~ told. that he was emaciated, atHI had hec-
tic fever; the disea::-e extended from the lowe to the hip, and
there \Yere four openings which discharged above n. pil"t of
matter U3.ily; there was con;;;tant cough aud other symptoms,
showing- that the constitution wa.;: giYing W<ty. He llild a tea..
cup full of splinters or bone which had come away. A few
months after he had been umlcr the \Vater Cu:c 1 s·tw the pa-
tient ; be had gained lle.::h, was able to take acti\'(! exercise on
crutches. and wn.s one of the mcrrie:-;t men in the crowd. I
went into his room frequently to examine and probe the wounds,
and extract pieces of bone. He complained of little or no pain
since he hnd worn the compres;:,e~: and got into a regular sys-
tem of treatment ; and all the function::; of the body had become
perfect: although the discharge was :::till very great. At the
end of six months his funds failin~. he was preparing to take
his departure: when Priessnitz told him t.lia.t it would take
eighteen months, two years; or perhu.p.:) longer, to cure so ex-
tensive a disease of the bone~, and that he might cat at his
table al;; lon(J' as it wa;:, necessarv. free of expense. I left him
~ -
there enJ·ovincr him::;eJf and in pcrfed hc·tlth, and the di:;ease.

althoucrh ..;till extensi\·e. certainlv better.*
That :. a man is no prophet iii his own country," the follow·
ing fact \Vill sutilcicntly show. Some three hnndred yards be-
low the I trge honse in which Prie.;;:::.uit::t: lives, there is the cot-
tag-e of a miller; his wife was ln.id np with typhus fever, and
attended by the two village practitioners. ~~bout the twelfth
' cby they tuld the hu~uand that they dc~paircd of her rccoYery.
At this juncture he bethought hirn to ask Priessnitz to see her.
H e irnmcJirttely complied, ami commenced the water treatment;
in a few da.ys the patient was without a bad syrnptolll, and re•
covered rapidly. 'Vhen the \Vater Cure treatment \vns com-
menced, she ha.d a dry black tongue, muttering delirium, and

the evacuations were passed without her kt.Pwleclg~,. ~elore
the miller had recourse to the \Vater treatment for Jus w1fc, ho
had heard that Priessnitz had treated some dm:cns of ca~es of
fever nnd had not been known to lose one, but '"'n the other
11and'be could not forget that he had been a working man, or
that water was not pli)..sic.
A servant maid, about nineteen years old, who had attcnd0.d
the miller's wife, was laid up with a severe fever, ju~t a::; her
mistress was recoverincr from it. Her sister was one of the
bath servants, and called my attention to the case; I attended
throughout, and witnessed the whole treatment. The fever
continued for eighteen day~, but during the whole time the
tonaue remained moist; the effect of the different proce.;:-\es
wa; beautiful, and every bad symptom was avoided. On the
twentieth day she was sitting out~ide tho door, convalescent,
and with very slight debility, which was gone by the end of the
week. I haYe several note bool\s filled with case:; and inci·
dents similar to those I ha,·o related, but I dare say I have
already written as many of them as you will read. I have only
now a few more remarks to make.
It is said that Prim~snitz owes the fir~t idea. he obtained of
some of the original processes of the 'Vater Cure, to hints from
intelligent patients during their treatment. Be this as it ma.y,
he has under!')tood and availed him::;elf of them to a good ac-
count.
Before the discovery of tho wet sheet, and before its use in
the treatmentofchronic disease w;ts uudcrstood, great mischief
must have been done iu many casrs by the misapplication and
too frequent U~:iC of tJ10 s\\·e:·ting pwce::;~. )lany mnst have had
their nervous sy~->tems much injured. vVhen l was at Graefen-
be;g a great change for the better had already taken place in
thts respect. Ji'rom the mfcct~ I experienced in my own person
as w~ll as observ.ed on other:.-) tram the wet sheet, I saw clearly,
·and mdeed predicted. abo~e two years ago, in my '' ork on the
\Vater Cure, that Pru'ssrutz would become le::.s mecha.nical in
his notions, and .s~eat his patients still less as he went on. 1
h3:-Ye heard that 1t ~s so, and it could not have been otherwi~e
w1th a man who 1s always observi11g and reilectina It ha"
b.een re~arkeu that Priessnitz l~as ?een a long time i~ getti~;
nd of lus own errors and adopting Improvements, but we can-
not wonder at the slowneo:is with which knowledge is gain ")d
and salutary changes of opinion come over the mind when ~~
all ~eel more or less.how strong is t,he force of habit and the

I have wished good-bye within the la~t three years to several
hundre<l~ nf ladies and gentlemen, who declared that the time
they had spent in the 'Vater Cure, had bt>en the mo...t cheerful
and happy period they could recollect,-the one in which they
had experienced the greate:;:t amonnt of the feeling~ of well-
being,-and that they took their departure with reg·ret.
Bnt I hold that the \Vater Cure is after all the shorte~t cure~
when the nature and extent of the clis('ac:f'd states that are sub-
mitted to it. are taken into consideration. If a patient is cureJ
in six month5 of a complication of ailment..., "·hich had r<:'c:i~ted
every variety of treatment for Eeven: ten, or, a..; it often happens,
a greater number of years, it cannot be ca!letl a long cure.

THE WATER CURE. 17
AN ACCOUNT
OF THE VARIOUS PROCESSES USED
IN THE
PRACTICE OF THE WATER CURE.
WATER AS A BEVERAGE AND AS A REMEDY.
IT is a matter of congratulation with all those who know and
feel how great the beneficial result will be, that the conviction
is daily gaining ground amongst the enquiring and enlightened
part of the community, that water is the best beverage for man,
and moreover that it is the only one necessary to keep him in
the highest state of health and strength.
Iu "An Essay of HEALTH and LO~G LIFE," by that real and
most estimable physician, the celebrated Dr. Cheyne, written
some hundred and fifty years ago, he says:-" Drink is the
other part of our food. The common drink here in England
is either water, malt-liquor, or wine, or mixtures of these.-
Without all peradventure, water was the primitive, original
beverage, as it is the only simple flu.id, fitted for diluting, mois-
tening, and cooling ; the ends of drink appointed by nature.
And happy had it been for the race of mankind if other mixed
and artificial liquors had never been invented. It has been an
agreeable appearance to me to observe with what freshness and
vigor, those, who though eating freely of flesh meat, yet drink
nothing but this element, have lived in health, tranquillity, and
cheerfulness, to a great age.* Water alone is sufficient and

cient beverage. It wa.::: the Jrink provided bv the beneficent
Creator for our fir::.t par~nts. \Vhen the kin~ of I::;rael made
"great provisions'' for the Syrian army, the drink was water.
\Vhen Abraham sent away Hagar, he gave her a bottle of
water. The angel that came to Ilao·ar in the wilderness,
pointed her to a place of water. "'hci~ Rebecca received the
offer of mnrriage, she gave to Abraham'::; ~en·ant water. Gid-
eon's three hundred vc.diant soldier::. Jranl\ water. At Nabal's
feast of !'beep-shearing, the drink provided was water. Elijah,
when fed by ravens, drank water; and when he came to the
widow of Zidon, a::;ked only for water. When ·the angel
brought him his provisions for the journey to Horeb, the liquid
in the crui~e was water. Good Obadiah fed the one hundred
prophets on bread and water. Job'~ tr~n·eller went to the stream
for water. The king of As::;yria promised the Jew::;: that on
submission they should cat their own vine, and drink the water
of their own cisterns. The IsraelitcR promised the Edomites
to purchase water. Timothy's usual drink was water, the
"little wine'' being pres~ribcJ medicinally. John the Baptist
took water. At the \YCll of Samaria. both Jacob and Jesus
drank water. King Saul in the cave had 1cater. ~arn--on and
his mother drank water, and WATER is the element chosen by
God to typify the choice:-t blessings of the heavenly world.
Notwithstanding that theory and practice have dcmon~trated
in e\·ery postiible way th:tt water is best: yet the majority of
mankind have vet bnt a faint idea of the extent of its salnbri-
l)us effects when taken in proper quantity internally, or applied
in different ways externally. In the former this ari~cs from
the practice of tal~ing bot tea, coffee, wine, spirits, and irrita·
ting medicines, &c., from an early age. 'fhe long iudulgcnce
in these fictitious habits produces an unhealthy 1'tnte of feeling,
attended with the fear that cold water would produce unplea-
sant sensations, and :.;ome injury to the stomach ; there is
therefore, a barrier to its use, made np of fear, dislike, preJU·
dice, and custom. But when this formidable barrier can be
leaped over, or broken down, by a little reasoning and rcflec·
tion, after a few essays the individual finds, and is convinced
that he has been depri\·ed of a great source of pleasure, and of
one of the most powerful conducers to health. By the great
change in the feelings, the greater aptitude for mental an.d
bodily exertion, the marked accession of ~heerfulnes~ and gat·

rrhe water is rapidly ab:mrbcd by the ~tonwch, not digested as
many suppo:ie : an(l pure water does not escape into the ali-
mentary canal. When it is all sucked tlp by the stomach, it
goes into the general cnrrent of the circulation; mixing with
the blood, it if' first carried into the lung~, and then sent on by
another set of tnbe:::, the arteries, to the tips of the fingers autl

benefits, giving new life and activity to everything it has come
in contact with. It is then in grettt part thrown off, (mixed
with waste matters,) by the :skin, in invisible stca1n; by the
kidneys and by the breath. When a glass of water is swal~

leaving it at n. more natural temperature, and giving it a more
healthy color.
It appears almost incredible with what rapidity cold water is
taken np by the healthy stomach. I once, by way of experi-
ment,* S\vallowed thirty tumblers of water from the spring
before breakfast--each equal to half-pint-two of which I
sometimes took at once. I was nearly three hours about it.
At nine o'clock I was so hungry that I could hold out no lon-
ger, I had intended to haYe tried another <.lozen. \Vhen I went
out at sh:, I had a wet bandage on the stomach tightly applied,
and covered by a thick dry one. \Vhen I went to breakfast,
the abdomen was diminished in size, for my bandage no longer
Rtuck so clo:se. I never enjoyed a morning'~ walk more, and
during the day felt perfectly 'Yell. At fir~t, when the stomach
is much out of order~ and the patient has not been accustomed
to drink water, it is well to begin as gradually as he plea-
ses. He soon gets to like it, not from thirst as is supposed,
but from itc; refre:,hing effect~. just as people take wine or
spirits without being thir::oty, to relieve a Jmv feeling, or produce
!l. tipsy one. Often when sitting down to my bread and butter,
milk and strawberries, with an appetite that would ha,re made
dry bread delicious, I could not help comparing my state to that
I conld vividly recall, after taking two pills over night, and a
white-no, a black draught in the morning. What a contrast
in every sense of the word- in the moral as well as the physi·
cal man--one as unwholesome, irritating, and depressing, as
the other was cleanly, refreshing and exhiiarating.
It is nece~sary to ob~erve, that most per~ons "·ho are delicate
or ailing~ by getting up before their usual time, and walking
before breakfast, proclnce lassitude, headache, and other disa-
greeables for the rest of the day; this unpleasant state does
not occur if part of what I have described is done beforehand,
and followed by n. few tumblers of water.
Simple as the mere act of drinking water may appear, there
are a varietv of diseased state~ in which its u~e requires dis-
cretion and ·manaaement. There are cases in whjch it produ-
::-:
ces great disturbance, and others in which the progress towards

THE SWEATING PROCESS.
THis is effected in a very easy and simple rr o.nner. The
bedding is removed and a blanket of the largest size is spread
out on the mattres::;. The patient lying down at full length: is
em·eloped in it a:; comfortably as possible1 and so as to fit well
about the neck ami feet. The best covering over this h; a
small feather or down bed, with a light ticking, which must be
tucked in about tho neck and shoulders, and all the way down
to the feet. It i:; well to elevate the head as high as the pa.-
tlent finds it couvenient, or comfortable. In this state he is
left till perspiration comes on. It is then allowed to continue
for a longer or a shorter time, according to circumstances. It
generally takes t\vo or three hours before the patient is in full
perspiration; but it is a good plan when it is slow, after the
first hour, to begin rubbing the hands gently against each other,
and up and down the sides, doing the same with the feet, but
not so as to fatigue, or affect the breathing. As the packing-
up takes place ear1y in the morning, not to lose any part of the
rlay, the patient has generally a good sleep for an hour or more.
\Vhen perspiration has fairly set in) tlv=- window is sometimes
thro\VD open, particularly in summer, and, from time to time,
half a tumbler of cold water is given to drink. "\Vhen it is
con"idered that ~:>ufficient perspiration has taken place: the bed
and blankets are thrown oft~ and the patient bteps into a bath,
(ifit be in his room,) containing about a foot and a half of cold
water, where he is well washed and rubbed, as~isting himself
as much as possible, but without being in a hurry. It is well,
in some cases, to have a basin of cold water at the side, in
which the patient just gives his hands, face, and breast a rub
before he sits in the bath. \Vhen the large bath is used, the
patient walks to it still enveloped in the blank£;;t: a doak thro·wn
over if necessary ; here he plunges in at once, if it is lcnge
enough. Sometimes it is necessary to have t\\·o baths. onr•
'.Vith cold, the other having water with the chill taken off or
even tepid. In this case, he enters fir!"t into the warmer bath,
and afler a goo 1 rubi.Jilw, transfers hjmself qnickly into the
colder one; where the sa~ne thing takes place for a minute or
two, returning again to the wa.rmer one. vVhere the douche
is in the house, it is sometimes made use of instead of the bath.
Af~r all these proce~ses: he dresses quickly, and goes out to

walk for an hour or longer, drinking from time to time a tum.
bler of water.
This mode of producing per:spirntion:' followed by the cold
bath, was at first thought the greatest discovery, and the_ n:ost
essential modification of the 'Vater Cure treatment. Stunng
up the system, and producing purgation and waste by the skin
-strengthening this again, as\.Yell as the internal organs, by the
bath, was considered by Priessnitz and his partizans so power-
ful, simple, and harmless an operation, that-combined with
the other salutary adjuncts of the Cure,-no diseased state
could resist it. For a long time this went on, and although in
many cases, the results answered their expectations, in many
others some disappointment, not to say mischief, took place.
Priessnitz, however, was too keen an observer not to see in the
end that he had been mistaken, and had carried it too far. There
is now a numerous class of patients in which he does not use
the sweating process, but be has not yet made all the reforma-
tion that I believe he will ultimately find necessary. Not so,
many of his imitators in different parts of Germany, who con-
tinue to this day to practise the serious errors, which he has
been gradually removing for several years. Conscious of the
errors he has fallen into, and always reasoning and observing,
he is more cautious, having learnt from experience that errors
are more or less the lot of every system, and that an approach
to perfection is only to be attained by constant thought and ex-
ertion. But he does not like to be reminded of the change in
his practice.
The application of tJ1e cold bath after a profuse perspiration
is thought by the many, and even by most medical men, to
be highly dangerous ; but, in fact, there is nothing more inno-
cent or exempt from danger when directed by a competent
practitioner; it is on the whole not more dangerous and cer-
tainly not as disagreeable as "two pills over night, and a black
draught in the morning." The practice of taking a cold bath
after sweating is of very ancient date, having been practi~ed
by the Russians and other northern nations from time imme-
morial, b~t with this imp?rta_nt difference-that they produced
the sweatmg by the apphcatwn of :hot vapor. This makes a
great difference from producing jt by the effort of the internal
organs and the concentration of animal heat ; one is much more
debilitating than the other, and the re-action after the bath is
not so good or permanent. Added to this, there is the great
objection of taking hot air or vapor into the lungs. I took a
great many Russian baths at Vienn1.,-in ~orne measure for

cxperiment,-and I am convinced of the immense difference of
the two processes, when they come to be frequently repeated
as in the 'Vater Cure. The safety of this process, as I hav~
described it, (the contt·ivance of which is dne to Priessnitz,) is
owing to the comparative calm and absence of irritation in all
the internal organs, or exhaustion of the nervous energy ; the
fresh air alone being inhaled by the lungs, and the co~ liquid
being introduced into the stomach,-both of which increase the
determination to the skin, and the sweating, when the latter
has once commenced.
\Vhen the body is in a state of perspiration, heated and ex-
cited by dancing, walking, ~ingiug, or talking, there is nothing
RO dangerous, more cspecin.Hy if the individual is weakly, or
has chronic disease, than drinking largely of cold water, or en-
tering a cold bath. \Ve have numerous examples of the fatal
effects of this imprudence. At Xnples, during the extreme
heat, and while the body is in a state of per~piration, one ob-
serve:,; the inhabitants drinking iced water freely, at all the cor-
ners of the streetc::, hut the perspiration they arc in, is in a
great measure a pas~ive one, arising from, and kept up by the
heat of the climate. A Polish gentleman told me that one of
his countrymen: a young physician,having heard from so many
quarters that hundretls were in the habit or taking the cold
baths in a state of p~rspiration, he,-withont thought or ac-
curate inquiry,-aftcr a long ride, exhausted and wet with per-
spiration, went and bathed in a river; he "·as attacked with
apoplexy, which carried him off in a fc\v days afterwards,
:showin" that he did not understand. or was not a\vare of the
0 •
different Etate the body is in; according to the moue of producing
the pcr:'piration. There is the same objeetion to the cold bath
after James's powder or any sudorific mcuicinc.
Per!:ipiratiou once set in, is allowed to continue from a period
of half an hour to an hour. As a general rule, this perspiration
mm;t be put a :;:top to, as soon as the patient feels a sense of
fati"ue, and before any feeling of debility comes on.
It would be but natura1 to suppose this process, continued
day after day for months together-as has been the case with
hundreds of invalids,-would cause great debility, and pull
down the individual to "the shadow of a ~h:tde ;'' but such is
far from beinO' the result in the majority of instances, where it
is proper it should be 11sed. Prince T.ic:htcnstei11 told J?e tlmt

that is proJuced by mercurial ::.alivation. \Vhen the:;,e mcrbid
phenomena appear, the per~pir<Ltion may be· considered of a
critical nature. As a gPneral rule~ where there is no evident
reason why this proce::;;:, ;:;hould not be u--c·l, ::-wcating followed
by the cold bath, i~ not debilitating; what is lost in one way is
repaired in another. The appetite b so much increa~cd, and
tbe functions of the skin and digestive organ::> so improved, that
the lo:-)s of a little fluid by sweating has only a f'alutary effect.
Fat is replaced by hanl elastic flc~h, and languor and debility
give way to a state of cheerfulne~s and acti\.-ity.
Great, how·ever, as the remedial powers~ ofthis natural means
of relieving the body and throwing oft' disease, may be made,
much injury has in many instances occurred from its abuse:
more particularly when combined with the plunge-bath and
douche. l\:Ir. Mayo mentioned a case by letter to one of my
patients, in which the most sPrious injury was suffered by the
nenous system, and the brain put in imminent danger, by the
misapplication of these pO\verful remedies. On my way to
Graefenuerg I was tempted to vbit ,m establil"hment beauti-
fully situated; fortunately I only remained ten days. I was
sweated, plunged} and doached, regularly, and !mowing little
practically of the ~y~tcrn at that time, I obeyed orders: the re-
3nlt wa:3 a seriou::. aggnwation of all my distre:-:;,ing symptoms.
During a period of above twelve months that I continued the
\Vater Cure: I did not sweat once, as a pre::;cription, and mo~t
properly so.
It is necessary to bear in mind that it i:; not the mere pour-
inu ant of sweat that relieYes or cures dbease. \Vhat is dc-
si~d to be June by the sweating process is to ronse the system
to tho:se efforts of cure which constitutes the p( culiarity of
treatment by the \Vater Cure. The sweat poun·d out i::; only
an indication that these effort::, have been made~ in the same
sense that the crisis is only n.n indication of similar efiorts on
a more continuous scale. Hence, if we find that the procpss
taxes the patienf:-1 power~, and especially hi::; head, it is proper
for the first time or two to take him out of tbc blankets and use
the bath, when a considerable heat has accumulated in the skin,
and before any sweat has flowed. In this manner we are en-
abled to coax, as it \vere, the skin into sweating, \vithout ex-
citincr the brain and nerves in a Larmful way; for after a few
trial;of this kind, the skin open::; and gives out its fluids, with-
out any injurious straining of the system.
Another way to counteract the headache, which sometimes
attends sweating, is to place a towel well wrung out of cold

it i:-' generally better to ubtam th~ sweat Without tho~~ atds; 1t
is th:n more entirely the work of the system ; there 1s less of

erallv unad\•i::;able, what .:-:hall be said of Uwse means that arc too
com{nonly ha.c.l recour~e to, to procure a speec.lier per:-pira.t.ion ?
I allude to the n:,.e of hot air u.nd hot vapor. \Vhy, that they
actually mar the aim of the treatHumt, fatliug to rouse the in-
ternal organs at all, a.ncl leaving the ~kin in an enfeebled and
sensitive ::;tate. The truth i~, tllat tile heat which causes the
sweat should be of the body·::; O\\'H acct~mnlatiou, aud proceed·
ing from its innermost part:s; whcn.:a::. tlti::. air or vapor is arti·
ficial heat applied to the ::;kin only, and going only ~ldn deep in
its eflects. .By Priessuitz':-:; method tho blood is uri\'Cll to the
surface; by the hot a.ir \'apor it i.:; dr.t'.\'11 to the :-:;urtitce from a

blood liable, on the application of the t:old b.1tb, to be dri\'en in

ceive and react upon the ~hock.
A further result of this mi:--ta.kcn mode of forcirw ::;,.,.·eat is

the actuiJl decrease of the appetite iH:-;tead of the increase of it,
which follows that by the blankets; :mel on the back of this

the impatience or invalids, who lll:.ty 1\::)t a:s:sured tltat it is a

The inhal:ttion of hut and dry air, (:--uch a::; patients arc made

This wa:::l the leading objection to the use of Arnott's ~.c ve in
chamuers, as all may remember; and it was a \'cry valid one.
But farther, it is in complete opposition to the principles of
the 'Vater Cure to inhale heated air at all. Rightly }Hoceecl·
ing on the doctrine that the blood is to be rendered healthy so
a:::l to permit the body to \\'ork its own restoration, the admission
of pure cool air into the lungs for the purpose of oxygenizing
that fluid is above all essential. Now, hot air being rarified,
docs not contain one half the oxygen that cold air does, and the
blood consequently loses just by oue half its vivifying and
strengthening agency: the dark blood from the veins is not
sufliciently changed by the air, and a blood unfit for the pur-
poses of life is allowed to flow through the body, and especially
in the :BRAIN, \vhere it congests, and produces the tense head-
ache that attends the inhalation of hot air. The consequence
of all which infallibly is, that when rheumatism, and one or
two other complaints, are relieved by this hot air sweating,
(and they have been so relieved,) their retmn may be relied
upon; no cure has been affected, because the very first princi-
ple of cure- the formation ofa healthy, rich blood, to enable the
body to effect its own restoration-has been sinned against. It
is one of the abuses of the \Vater Cure that ought to be depre-
cated by all who understand that cure and wish its success.
THE \VET ~HEET.
THE application of a wet sheet, as it is used in the Water
Cure, is, I believe, one of the most extraordinary and valuable
remedies that has ever been discovered ; whether we look at it
in its admirable effects, or the extensive range of diseased
states to which it may be applied with benefit.
The bare idea, however, of lying in a wet sheet, staggers
people more, I find, than any part of the Water Cure. There
are many who believe that some of the processes of our treat-
ment may be of service, and can imagine that water has some
virtues notwithstandina that it is only "simple water that we

notwithstanding- the puzzle, the wet ::;beet, and it~ acculupnJti·
menb, will rctnO\·c and cure all the cfJccts atlriuuted tu the
"damp sheet/' or ~heets.
\Vhen a person lies all night in damp sheets, the air not o."iug
completely excluded, and being at the same time more or !~·~~
derancrcd in his internal economy, there is great dangf!r tl!at
illnes; in somP. shape or other will be the re~ult; the equiliuri-
um of the vital functions has been interfered with, tl1e inscn:-:i-
ble perspiration checked, and the nervous sy8tem put iuto an
lmcomfortable and irritated state. Priessnitz thinks (for a.
friend of mind asked him the question) that the alkali u~ecl in
the washing has Romething to do with the unpleasant con~e­
qucnces; but there are sufficient reason~, added to tho:;e al>o\'e
mentioned, to account for the danger of sleeping in damp ~beets,
without the one mentioned by Pries~nitz, even supposing it had
anything to do with it. The wet sheet used as a remedy is
something very diflerent from a damp one; the one is danger~
ous, the other a life preserver.
It is an application which has often, and will full oft again,
save many children's tears, many a father's grief, and mother's
lamentation.
I shall now describe how it is made and applied, and its
effect~. A strong linen sheet is dipped in cold water, and
wrung till no more water can be expressetl without difficulty.
At Graefenberg they have a good plan of doing 1his : the sJ1eet
is thrown round a pole, or round rail, and the two ends meet-
ing, it is easily twiRted into a cord: aud the water wruncr out;
when this is done, the :-;ervant enters the room, and the patient
jumps up ; the bedding is thrown oft; an.d a large blanket laid
out on the mattress; on this the sheet is smoothly placed. The
patient, lying down full length, nearly on his back, with his
head as high as he p1r.ases on the pillow, has the sheet \\lapped
round him, fitting close just above the collar bones and down
to. the feet, wl~ich ~rc includ.cd; the blanket is then quickly ap-
pltctl, by drawlllg flr~t. one ~tde ancl tucking it in well auout the
neck, under one sltoultler, and romul the Jeo·R and then thn

very agreeable, but it goc:; o!l' very quickly, and then it i~ •my-

being al>le to e:::cape, it b at 1irst rapidlv taken up by the cold
s:1eet; if in a few minntcs the ham.l be pa~seu over the bouy
and then applied to the ~hcet, the former will be tuunu to be
cold anu the latter quite warm. .Matters arc now changed-
th~ ::;urface of the bouy is cool, and the sheet warm, anu ::;o the
struggle goes 011 between the two, till both arc warm; wheu
this takes place, the patients take the culu or chilled, the half
or full, bath as may l>e, ure;:;::; quickly, turn out Jor a Wi-dk of an
hour or so. and drink :;ome tumbler::> of water, '·and then to
hreakf~lst with \\'hat appetite they have." The aluerman that

Independently ot the Cttlming etlect that tlti::> IJlotlc of applying
a wet sheet has on the ncn-ous sy:stPm and the iuternal organs,
it. has a great power in improving the tone and texture of the
::-kin, increasing its react1vc power, and lessening the unfavor-
able influence that cold and damp, or :::.uutlen changes of tem-
perature have upon it. It has a peculiar cnct:t on the pores,
which is uitlicult to describe. The cold lnth is much more
agreeable, and taken with much less reluctance after the wet
fiheet, for it removes that ~tate of the :snrfacc which produces
a sense of chill or a ::,light shudder on the applic 'tion of cold
Witter; it prevents that dry or rough ~tate or the :-.kin which
sometime;:; take£ place from applying cold water frequently in
the day and for a lrmgtl1 of time. After a. Jong journey, or
travelling day anu night; a wet sheet and cold or chilled bath

Scientific medical practitioners are aware that there arc two
ways of giving 1wa1th and strength to a frame laboring under
disease; viz., by relieving the irritation of some particula; part,
which disturbs and oppresses the other organs; and by dJrcctly
giving tone to the really enfeebled body.
The curative and strengthening operation of the wet sheet
mainly consists in the former of these ways. In all chronic, as
in all acute disorders, there is one organ, or series of organs,
whose irritation or inflammation proves oppressive to the other
organs, and the cure is to be found in the reduction of this irri-
tation. The fact goes far to explain the very extensive, almost
universal, employment of the wet sheet in disease. Its extra-
ordinary power in allaying hritation, is one of the most curious
facts of the Water Cure, and of which it is really difficult
to give a full and sa.tisfactory rationale. vVhen properly
modified to meet the actual state of the patient, it may be said
to be the most soothing application that can be administered to
the external sentient surface. Jt may be compared in its calm-
illg effects to a poultice placed ttll over the body, but this is only
stating a fact in othN words. It carries oft' 1everisb heat, and
this heat is employed in convertilJg the moisture in the sheet
into vapor; so ti1at the patient may be said to Le in a ~team
bath of his own making. This \Varm vapor settling on the skin,
ma_kes it soft and moist, and is very often tnistaken for perspi-
-atwn; but the wet shePt, used for the purpose of reducinO' irri-
tation, is not, as a general rule, allowed to remain lono- e1~ouo-h
to induce sweating,-which is a di~ectly opposile pro~ess a~d
intended for a ditlcrent purpose from the wet sheet. But ,~hat­
ever be the physiological }Jrinciple upon which the wet sheet
acts, it will be found unring the treatment of most diseases by
the Water Cure, ::m inuispeusable remedy, a.nd one on which
the practitioner can safely rely.
Being applicable where there is morbid irritation it is an in-
valuable remedy in all internal and external inilamm~tion acute
an~ chronic.. In acut.e disease it .is.frequently chang~d, the
patient not bemg permitted to rema1n 111 it lonaer than suffices
to warm the sheet, which in fever; for instance~may be a quar-
:'HE WATER CUltE. 33
ter of an hour or c,~en less. It is thus changed several times
consecutively, increasing the time as the heat is reduced, and
the shallow-bath, cold or chilled, follows. In this proces~ two
evident effects are produced, an immense quantity of heat is
carried off from the surface, the pulse becomes soft, and falls
in rapiuity.
After this, wheu the patient has been some time in bed, the
heat on the surface again accumulates: but as the internal or-
gans have been relieved, and the skin placed in a more favora-
ble state for perspiration, this last commonly ensues, and na-
ture relie\·es herself. Should, however, perspiration not take
place, and instead of it, a return and continuation of the dry
feverish skin, the wet sheet is recommenced as before ; and so
on every fh·e or six hours perhaps. It should be remarked, that
in complaints, which a high degree of fever accompanies, it is
generally necessary to employ only three or more blaukets for
a covering.
This is the ordinary mode of applying the wet sheet in acute
disease; and its application is only moditieJ in frequency, ac·
cording to the intensity of the feverish or inflammatory symp-
toms.
Among the advantages of this safe, simple, and refreshing
means of reducing fe\'er anJ inflammation, i~ that of not caus-
ing any actual loss of strength to the patient, as by bleeding
and strong medicines, and, as a necessary result, it is not at-
tended by long convalesc~nce or debility. lt may be compared
to putting out a tire by throwing \vine-glassful after wiue-glass-
fnl of ,\·ater on it, insteaJ of raking out the coal and cinders.
The fire by this gentle method. ln::; l.Jcen extinguif'hcd without
making a du!')t: or pToclucing any injury to the surrounding fur-
niture.
But in chronic diseases of long stanuing, a variety of modi-
fications are called for, both with reference to the symptoms
originally presented: and to those which arise in consequence
of the \Vater treatment.
Patients often present themselves in whom the vital energy
is so \VofulJ3 lowered by long disease and bad nutrition, with
ba.d bloou, that any considerable amount of stimulus would
prove too much for their powers. These persons woul~ ne.vcr
a.t fir.-3t get warm in a cold wet she?t, becau.se, as tins wtth-
dra.ws the animal heat from the surface, the mternal parts do
not possess vigor enough to labor to supply that which has
been abstracted. The patient, therefore, remains cold and mis-

as by the aid or drinking water, and by the rC'tluction of irrita-

the patient acquire~ appetite and power of blood-making; the
temperature of the sheet is then lowered until it comes to be ap-

For a. similar rv..t~on, it is neces::;ary in ~orne instances to
apply the wet sheet only over the trunk of the body, lea'lincr

dry towel over the rc~ion of that organ i:-:: f(Hlnd to render the
5hcet bath bearable and enicient for good ; when the r-:hcet.
becomes warm, the dry towel can be put at the side in some
cases. But this only applie~ to neryous disonlc>rs of the con-
tents of the chest; all inflammatory disease~. there, from a sim-
ple catarrh to the rnost ~erious statQs, require that the t-:hect
shomld be in immediate contact with the surface of the cheRt.
There is no case in which this indirect application of the
sheet to the stomach and bowels is dc~irnbh• ; it wonld seem
that that part being the starting point of nlmo::it all ailments,
both bears and require::; the full operation of this mo::;t powerful
and wonder-working agent in the 'Vater Cure. 'fhc sheet
will always be found fir::;t heated over this region.
The time inwhich it is neceRsary to remain in the wet l->heet,
mu~t vary with the power::; of the individual submitted to it.
Snppose a patient to be forty or forty-live minutes before he
feels thoroughly warm in it, it is generally aclvhmble to leave
him for an hour and twenty minute~. or an honr anti a half
from the first packing. T.he acl'l.unnlation of warmth then
produces sufficient circulating p<.nYer in the skin to re-act upon
the subsequent ablution iu the shallow-lmth or dripping sheet.
l\lorcover, this siowness in warming in the ::5heet implies an
inveterate degree of irritation anJ oppre~sion in ::-ome internal
organ, which therefore requires a full qn:mtity of the soothing
and der nttive eflccts of the remedy in qnestinn.
·WheH, however, the patient sp~edily-that i!4: in ten or fif-
teen minutes-gets thoroughly warm in the paeldng, an hour is
the outoide time rcquh;ite for him to rcmnin. '!'here are some
cases where e\'en this i:l too long, and they are known by he:td-
ache, swimming, and sensation:; of faintiltg showing them-
selves. In the:)e cases the irritation to be reuto\·cd, not bcin"
of that inveterate kind which iuterferc~ with bloocl-maldnD' ana
heat-making, caloric soon accumulntt's, and to tinch an e~tcnt,
as to cause the sheet to pa~s from it:-; soothinu' to its irritatinrr
and depressing etage of 11gcncy; and the pnl~c falls so low a~
to cause irregular circulation in the brain, and the phenomena
above mentioned.
Between these extrm.1cs of pecu!i:uitv as regards the action
of the wet (•1ect, theu~ are numerous ·shade:;. But to detect
T H I:. ,,. il T C I< C U R E • 37
any of them.. and thus to obtain all the good available from
the remedy, requires not a small ::tmount of mcd.ic:tl knowl·
edge, and experience in the practi-2c vf the \V;.\tCr C~ue.
As one great result of the wet sheet is lo produce augmen·
ted and healthy srcretions from the mncou::s membrancs-espe·
cially the digestive-the state of those membnmc:.S should he
accurately examined previous to ordering it and during its use.
In the cotu-:!e of its employment, in a gTeat number of cases,
that portion of the mucous membrane which lines the ducts of
the liver pours out a great quantity of bile and mucu~, giving
rise to the phenomena conjointly called "biliousness., It is
by virtue of tbis power that it cdtccts such wonders in cases of
inveterate constipation, with obstructed and"turgid livers; and
thong~1 this peculiar action is desirable in so many j nstances,
there are others in which it is important to avoid it. Of those
the practitioner must judge by the practice of his medical
acuteness.
The secretory agency of the wet sheet alluJeJ to, points out
its impropricty.-or the care with whirh it must be used,-in
all cases where the feebleness of the bowels readily leads to
exhausting diarrhrea.
So long as there is internal irritation to remove, the patient
goes on daily gaining power of speedily warming in the sheet,
and the time for his remaining in it consequentty diminishes.
But when irritation i~ subdued, the wet sheet, if continued too
long, tends to produce the symptoms of depression already
mentioned; the patient does not f~el comfortable in it, though
it be 'vann ; he gets out of it weary and weak ; and his head
begins to suffer.
From the few preceding observations, it may eaf'i]y be im-
aD"ined how admirably the etlects of this remedy must be, in
c~ses where there is constitutional irritation following surgical
operations, or where the body has received any severe shocks
or injuries.
Many suppose that the \Vater Cure is a lowering system of
treatment, and that the wet sheet is intended as a lowering
remedy. '£here is no doubt that it has this effect in some cases
when too freqnently repeated, and when its use i:s not properly
regulated. The idea, however. of its being a lowering reme?y,
has arisen in a great measure from many persons loaded w1th
fat) becoming thinner under its application ; but as a genc~al
:ule, the lowering is in weight rather than in stren~th ; for m·
stance, when the patient is bloated, encumbered With fat, am]

that of its becoming a b0antifnl ro<;;C color. ThiR will ~onw­

thank;:; of all tho3e who ha\·c experienced ib b •nciit:". and the
honors with which he will be remembered by postl.!rity.
Many f.inppose that he hit upon this novel application by
accident, bnt there i~ no doubt that he arrived at it by a reg-
ular conr~e of inductive rea!'ouing. The 'vet compre;;s applied
to local injurie;:;, to parts intiamed ex~rnally, to di~ea~ccl skin,
and over the seat of internal inflammation, acute and chronic, he
had long u"ed, before he thought of applying the ~:1.me rem-
edy in a more extensive fonn. ..\pplied loc<tlly, he observe(l
that it relieved the part::; from hcu.t aud pain, extracted morbid
secretions, aucl produced many othPr remarkable and salutary
effect:;. Ob~en·ing the hot and dry ::;kin, the accompanyin,,.
feeling::- of wearine.:,~ and often of pain in fe\'Cr, he rnu~t ha\'~
said to him->elf, why not apply the :->a.me remedy to the whole
body which I find so serviceable when applied to loca.l pa.rts
laboring under hea.t, pain, &c. He tried it-and when he saw
the result of the opel\ttion of the wet sheet in the first case of
fever, I can easily imagine him to have cried out like Archim-
ede~, "Enreka !" l''or a long time he only applied it to fevers
and inflammations. but latterly he dit5covered tlmt it was a valu-
able remedy in the treatment of chronic diseases ; the nse and
extraordinary effectR producerl by it in these sta.tes after a
time opened his eyes more fully to the abuse which i1a.d been
committed with the ::;wea•ing process. more pa rticnlarly when

THE DOUCHE BATH.
THE douche is one of the processes of the vVater Cure
that requires much judgment in prescribing. Its powerful
effects as a remedy has been known for agcg, but it is only of
Jate years that it has been fairly ::;tudied, its many valuable
properties fully- appreciated, and its application reduced to a
rational system. The reason \Yhy this has been the case (and
the same remark is applicable to other modes of using water)
is sufficiently obvious. To obtain aU the rcmedia"i action re-
s::~lting from any one of the processes of the \Vater Cure, it is
necessary that they should be used conjointly,-the effect of
one hanging upon the other, and thus increasctl, lessened or
modified, in their ultimate operation. Until the time of Priess-
nitz. no man of genius bad devoted all his powers exclusively
to the study; many had a knowledge of the virtues of certain
applications of water ; other physicians of gren.t talent, learn-
ing, and experience, predicted what has since been established,
-that \Yater, from the varied efrects it cu.n be made to produce:
i.:;, as nearly as possible, an universal remrt!y, resembling many
of onr mo::.t potent drugs, including blcediug and blistering:
bnt with this great advantage, that it is rnorc certain in produ-
cing the effect desired, and not followed by the destruction ana
mi!:)chief which so often follows the long-continued use of
stronCT medicines, whether drawn from the mineral or vegetable
kingd~ms; and the same remark applies to blistering and
bleeding.
The douche is formed by a column of water, descending per-
pendicularly from ten to twenty feet, and from one to four
inches in diameter. To prevent its separating into a shower
bath, when the fall is great, it is necessary to condnct it
t1 rouCTh a tube for some distance in its descent.
Th~ best time for takinCT this bath is after brea.l\fast, from
ten to twelve o"clock) it is ~sed, however, before breakfast, and
in the evening in ce1,:~in cases, sufficient exercise being takei'

tem. It shonlu be t.ak1'll fir:;t on the palm:::. ol .tl1c lnwd:-;, fol-

to fall on the shoulder~, lup~, antlloms. tllc·n tlu• arms and legs
may be subjected to it for a time. The stomach unrl abdomen
must not be pla.('ed utu.lcr it. The duration of thi:; b:lth i::; gen-
erally from fh·e to ten minutes.
\Vhen a patient is somewhat ad\·anced in rccoveJT, after a
few minutes' application of the douche, the whole surface of
the body a:;sumes a be:mtifnl deep rosy color, which last:< du-
ring the period of dressing; accompanic<l by a feeling of activity
and well-being, producing courage in the mind, and strength in
the muscuiar system, with an inclination to active movement.
There is slight apprehension at fir:'t when the splash of the
descending water is heard, but after the fir:-;t C!'say it goes off;
nor does the patient ever willingly return from a large douche
1o a smaller one. Taking the douche is not attended by the
disaCTrccahle sen:;ntious c.xpPrienced during a shower bath, and
is ]o~ked forward to with pleasure.
The douche is a powcrfu] auxiliary to the general treatment,
but its Ui':le requires great discrction,-a carcfnl inquiry into the
state of the con::;titution of the patient, and a knowledge of the
pathological ~tate he ma.y be laboring nntler. It puts th1~ whole
E'ystcm into a state of activity and excitent.cnt: forcing the blood
to the surface, acting- on the !:'tomaclt allfl bowels, and increas~
ing the actiYity Of all the fnnctions. \\"}wn HSt'd at the proper
time, it forwanL; the cri:::b that the ~.r~tcm mny be preparing.
It is never applicabl~ ns long as ~·ny amount of local irrita-
tion exi:...ts; and to ascertain the exact point at which such irri-
tation being about to c.ea~c, the system rcrptirc:-. to be stimulateu
and aided in its cfiort:-; to throw it on the exterior, some tact
and experience is required. If a patient be sent under the
douche in whom there is an inflammatory coudition of the stom-
ach, for instance, this will certainly be exa~pcratctl: and the
head will simultaneous!\• suffer. For, as the ~hock of the fall-
ing \Vater is first impressed upon the extremities of thP nerves
wlJich proceed directly from the brain, it is cmweyed immecli·
3:tcly to the latt~r organ, which, sympathising strongly at all
tlmcs (and especwlly 111 the &upposcd case) with the stomach
transmits to the inflamed digestive organ the shock it:;elf
received from the skin; and thus brain and stomach arc
thrown into disorder nt once, and headache, trctnblinCTs of tho
legs, somnolence, and S)metime~ nansca, arc induced~

apoplectic fullness of the head, though not always so in con-
gestive or atonic fullness of that org~m. And great care is
requisite in determining which of these states predominates.
In pure congestion of the bra.in, unaccompanied with any in-
flam"!natory condition of the digestive canal, well-regulated
do11Cbing is of the first benefit, and will prevent the palsy of
the limbs, which more or less extensively follows> if it be left to
itself. vVhereas the same in apoplectic fullness, would in all
probability hasten a seizure; and unfortlmately such l1as been
the result iu some establishments where the advise of compe-
tent medical men has been dispensed with.
So also when that species of indigestion is present, in which
the nerves of the entire abdomen have lost their power of con-
trolling the circulation there, and now the liver, now the stom-
ach, and again the bowels, are the seats of transitory inflam-
mations, and the constant symptom is an irritated or depressed
state of mind, the douche is rarely applicable, or requires to be
used with reference to the passing condition as shown by the
pulse, tongue, &c.; it may thus be beneficial to-day and inju-
rious to-morrow, and the physician must exercise his attention
and discrimination accordingly. Such cases are but too fre-
quently those which come for assistance from the Water Cure,
~fter seeking it for a long time in vain from other plans of
treatment.
On the other hand, the douche is highly beneficial and rnay
be freely employed when, by fomentations, wet-sheeting, and
sitz-baths, &c., local inflammations of the muccus membranes
of the digestive or urinary canals, have been subdued, and the
tonic effects of the treatment alone are required. This is the
reason why it is so seldom used in the OLlt~et of the treatment ;
for the inflammatory states in question form the basis of the
great majority of diseases that are presented to the vVater Cure.
Again, when the malady of the solid organs of digestion,-the
liver, spleen, and sweetbread,-consists jn a sluggish retention
of blood in their substance, which impedes their function, aud
thus generates slowness and imperfection of digestion, torpid
bowels, &c. ; the state, in shortJ to which the term "oustruc-
tion" is commonly applied; in such cases, a stimulus applied
to the extremities of the nerves, and transmitted tlu-ough the
whole nervous system, rousing the circulation, is what is
wanted, and is well supplied by the douche. .
\Vhen a similar state of" ob~trnction" exists, and has ex1ste<.l
for a long time in some portion of the brain or spinal cord,

douche plays a powcrfnl p:trt in re-producing that action of the
joints themseh·e::;, which atlunl.._, the natural lnbric<Lting fluid in
them, as well as rousing that action in the nervous system,
which enables the mn-.cles of the limbi' to rc:-;ume their func-
tion, and thus as~i:->t in getting the joints into play again.-
IIere too the internal inllarnuntiou must be iir:::-t of all got rid
of; in every case this b a sine qua 1lon.
In patients who,-from the Jeva~ta.ting cftl:!cts of mercurial or
iodine course~,- have that portion of the nerrous ~ystem
which regulates the circnlation and Recretion, shattered; and
the functions of dige:-;tion aud blood making a.re rendercJ
vicious, and the blood therefore j mpure and unlit to nourish
the body in a healthy manner, the douche! by powerl'nl!y rou~­
ing the flagging ner\'es in qnc:-;tion, and thus causing improved
circulation and Jigestion, is e:;sential ; in conjunction, howerer,
with other appropriate part::; of the \Vater treatment.
Ruch is a very brief outline of the conditions of body which
Tequire or are opposed to the employment of thi~ powerful agent
of the \Vater Cure. Circumstances of the pulse, the nervous
energy, and of the skin, may and do from time tu time arise in
the course of a geneml m·d:u.ly, which call npon the pra.cti-
tionr.r to use the donche for a few day:; and then stop ; but it
is irnpos::;lble to detail tho:-:c circumstances in any book, how-

cess, or after the envelopment in the wet sheet. In this bath
the patient is in a sitting postnre, and remains from two to ten
minutes, being employed in rubbing and wa~hing tha difcerent
parts of the person; the attendant p~rforming the same office
on the back. Once or twice during the bath, fresh wat'er may
be poured over the head and shoulder£, or the patieut may do
this with a washhand jug, or a large sponge.
From the sitting position in which the patient is pl<>ced, tne
feet and hips are necessarily more cooled and powerfully act~d
upon by the water than the other parts of the body. After tne
bath, the determination of blood is .greatest to the lower f. x-
tremities, and the great nen·ons centres of the brain and diges-
tive organs are relieYed by their sympathy with these part.~.
By the general ablution and rubbing a chill is prevented, an.l
the circulation equalized on the whole surface of the body.
When used alone, it is simply for the purpose of maintaining
vigorous circulation on the surface, ami the best time for taking
it is on getting out of bed in the morning.
Employed after the envelopment in the wet sheet, it operates
by indirectly fi.'1:ing the circulation on the eA'tcrnal skin. The
wet sheet has the property of equalizing the circulation of
blood when it is congested on the mucoL1S membrane or in any
internal part, and an increased quantity of blood flows towards
the skin. But as the warm vapor, which has been for some time
surrOtmding the body when em·eloped in the sheet, renders the
skin soft am.l sensitive: it becomes neces::-ary to obviate tllis by
stimulatina the skin with water, and inducing a slight shock,
the secondary effect of \Vhich shall be to send a rnsh.ing tide
of blood to the surface, and render·it independent of the exter-
nal atmosphere. Thus the blood is first of all gently drawn to
the ~mrtace, by the soothing and gradual action of the wet sheet
and the vaporous warmth that is generated, the skin at tl~e samo
time beinD' rendered sensitive; taking advantage of wh1ch ~en­
sitiveness~ you, in the second place, induce by friction. in the
shallow bath, a rush of blood to the skin ; and by repe~tmg t~1s
doubl~ process day after day, a healthy aud equable ctrculntton
is induced throughout the botly; the blood bemg at length per..

shallow bath requires in ~orne cases to be persc' ered in for a
length of time, after using; quickly repeated wet sheet:-;.
The temperature of the shallow bath, after one wet sheet,
will be recrnlatcd by the considerations that have been noted
when speaking of the wet sheet itself. (See lVet Sheet.)
As a sequel to the s\veating proces:-;, the shallow bath is
employed to obviate the relaxation of the skin which would
infallibh• ensue, were that surface merely dried after the out-
pourina-of sweat bv its blood-\'csseh;. To the~e la:-:t the cold
acts as
0
a grateful and beneficial tonic and stimulant; but the
~econdary effect is still to fix a good quantity of blood on the
e.:\:terior. The duration of the bath after sweating varies from
t\YO to eight or ten minutes. 1'he temperature, as a general
rule, is always cold; the frame that is ~uited for sweating
being in mo:;t cases able to bear the common temperature of
water.
For the purposes aimed at in using· ablution and friction after
the sheet or blankets, the shallow bath is in almost every par-
ticular preferable to the plunge bath. The plentiful friction
produces an equally great ant! fixed circulation of blood in the
skin; ",·rhilst the shock of the water being more gradnally ap-
plied, no risk is to be apprehended of the brain :-:uffering from
the sudden and violent revulsion which accompanies tlw plung~
ing up to the throat in cold water, the ~kin ~till glo\\·ing with
heat. A physician should well examine l1is patienf~ powers
and be well certified of the integrity and ~trength of his brain
circulation, before he orders the plunge bath.
'Vith the shallow bath and frictions the patient i:; completely
under the control of the practitioner, and I am conviuced hy
experience that all the remedial intentions are equally weil
fulfilled, without any of the risk of the plunge bath. A gen-
tleman under my care la::>t summer, (Sir J. .M- ,) told me that
he hnd su.fiered se,·erely hy going into the plunge bath; he used
the :-liallow bnth here with the grentcst beuefit. Even where

THE SITZ BATH.
THIS bath is a most important part of the 'Vater treatment,
and the occasions for its employment are to be found in almost
every disorder whether acute or chronic.
'Vhen ::;cated in the bath, the water shonld reach to the navel,
and the patient must use friction to the abdomen, f-rom time to
time with the hand. A tumbler of water should also br placed
at the side, nnd a portion taken at intervals ; it adds to the
refreshing effects of the bath.
The sitz bath is used either as a tonic or a derivative. In the
former case it i::; taken cold, and for a time, varying from five
to fifteen rninntc5, seldom exceeding the latter period.
The rationale of its operation in this character is sufficiently
simple. The stimulus of the cold cause::; the blood ves~els of
the part aml neighborhood to which the water is applied, to
contract and thereby rid themselves of any excess of blood:
and as this stimulus has not been carried to a great extent,
there is very little subsequent return of rela.""<ation in those
vessels ; still there is some ; and it is for this reason, that it
becomes nPccssary to apply the stimulus ngain after E'l10rt in-
tervals; short sitz baths always require frequent repetition,
sometimes as often as ::;ix or seven times in the twenty-four
hours. It will appear from the ab0ve, that the ::;hort or tonic
sitz bath, is applicable in all cases where there is an enfeebled
or congested state of the parts contained 'vithin the hips, for
instance, in excessiYe menstruation, leucorrhcea, loss of mus-
cular tone, and protrusion of the lower gut, &c., &c.
It is, however, more especially for it::; derivative effect that
the sitz bath i:s most frequently employed. The class of dis-
orders for which such eflect is desirable. is far more numerous
than those in whkh the tonic result is '~i~hcd; and it includes
some phases of brain congestion, obstrlH~tions o( the 1iver, con-
gestion of the stomach and its nerves, stoppage of courses, and
THE PRA~TICE OF
constifJatiou of the bov·:el.-; -tlisea~cd states whicl1 include all
the forms of di(J'estive and 1;ervou.s complaints. Here the stim-
ulus of the cold i:-; applied so long that the blood vessel::; of the
parts contained "ithin the hip!:), after a. violent tonic contrac-
tion fall into a state of great consequcnt exhanstion and relax-
atio~, whereby a gren.t quantity of blood is admitted and retained
in them. The result is doubly advantageous; for first, a mass
of blood is drawn from the upper orgaus of digestion, the liver,
stomach, &c., and eveu from the head, whose obstruction and
congestion it therefore relieved; and secondly, this blood so
made to congest in the lower organs of digestion and in the gen-
ital and urinary organs, secretes the matters peculiar to those
parts, and thus the bowels are made to act, and the monthly
evacuation of females is removed, and the ftmctions of the kid-
neys and bladder is promoted.
The temperature at which it is fit to take the sitz bath is
important. Its tonic effect, as already explained, i::J best, and
indeed only obtained by the cold degrees, that is, under sixty
degrees. The degree at which to obtain the derivative eftect
will vary with the organic capabilities of the patient, and these
the physician must ascertain by previous investigation. It
must also have reference to the patient's power of taking exer-
cise aftm· it; for if he remain cold for ·waut of exercise, the
tonic and not the derivative result will ensue, ami it has been
shown that the cases for these are diametrically opposite. Pa-
tifnts in a very low condition of vital activity, but in whom it
is rlesirable to produce derivation of Llood to the lower organs
of digestion, shonld in the first instance be submitt:~d to water
of a tepid temperature or nearly so, and the degree shonld be
lowered as the strength increases. The amount of derivation
in such event is not so great nor so permanent as when water
at forty to fifty degrees is used; but a judicious practitioner
will suit his remedies to his patient's power, and not go by blind
rules. The Water Cure is the cold water cure only in time
and place, and where the individual peculiarities permit, or th(
patient has been brought into a state to benefit by it.
The sitz bath is a powerful antispasmodic ; it removes :fiat
u1cnce, colic, and vomiting, of the most violent and obstinate
nature. In the treatment of dysentery it is an invaluable ad
junct, &c.
1. H F. \V A T E R C l. R E • 47
THE WET SHEET BA,.rH, OR DRIPPING SHEET.
Tms is used as follows :-The sheet is steeped in cold
water, and wrung just sufficiently to prevent its dripping too
much. In this state it is thrown ove1· the patient, 'vho, embra-
cing the fore parts with his arms, and hands, commences rub-
bing his chest, face, and fore part of the person, at the same
time that the attendant pursues the same process on the back,
loins, and lower extremeties. This may be continued for two
or three minute~: or more, when it is replaced by a dry sheet,
when the same thing takes place, till the patient is well dried.
This is an excellent portable bath, yery useful as a daily ablu-
tion, and very convenient in travelling. It is always followed
by a pleasing general warmth~ approaching a glow, and has
great advantages 0\·er the usual mode of washing. By its
daily use, it renders the surface le~s sensitive to changes of
temperature, and removes the disposition to take cold. After
the first instant, it is not a disagreeable application.
In some cases it iR repeated freqtlently in the day, and may
loe made a powerful stimulant and tonic. It is a very refresh-
.ng application, and carries off feverish heat.
THE HEAD BATH.
THE patient lies full length on a mattrass or on the floor; a
dish, containing abont four inrhes of water, is placed so that
the back part of the head rests in it; the head is sometimes
turned on the right; sometimes on the left side, as may be in-
dicated. This bath lasts from five to twenty minutes.
THE FOOT BATH.
THIS bath is taken in a vessel containing from two .to five
inches of water, and continued from five to twenty-five ~wutes,
according to the effect wi~hecl to be prorlnred. Dnnng the
48 T Jl E P 1: A t. T 1 1; .E 0 F
period one foot must be rnbbcd ngaint't the o~hcr, or an atten-
dant mnst u~e fri ction with han·l::;. The bram and the great
nervons centre at the pit of the ~tomach, sympathise s~rongly
with the feet. I have seen a violent attack of hystencs, at-
tended with insensibility, removed in throe or four minutes by
the cold foot bath. This bath is of great use in the Water
Cure.
THE ELBO\V BATH.
THis is taken in a basin containing from six lo ten inches
of water. It is of f,rreat service in injuries and diseased states
of the hand. It may continue from ten minutes to half an hour
or longer. To illustrate the nse of this bath, I may mention a
duel with sabres which took place at Graef(mberg, and a.t vvhich
I was requested to g·ive my assistance. One of the combat-
ants, after a severe wound, lost his presence of mind; ana
instantly put out the left hand to defend himself; he immedi-
ately received two cnts dovvn to the bones, one on the wrist,
and the other across the palm of the hand. Ile was taken to
his room in a fainting sta.te, and after the surgical part of the
busine::;s, a wetted compress and bandages were applied, and
the elbow was then placed in a basin of water. The patient
soon experienced a diminution of pain, and in twenty minutes,
declared that he was hardly conscious of the existence of the
wounds. In the evening there was some cerelm.tl excitement,
which was removed by a sitz bath. The next mornin.cr he was
enveloped for an hottr in the wtung ~heet; it prod~ced the
most tranquillizing effect, and freed the pa.tient from some irri-
tative fever. All the wounds healed rapidly, and without any
pain, drawback, or confinement.

Eun sure would not be credited by many, without ocular demon.
stration. It was in a great mea~:ure by using their" charmed
water" that the number of "miraculous cures" we read of in
past times were performed.
Dr. :
Macartney, the late Professor at Trinity College, was
the first in Great Britain to call attention to the admirable
effects of water applied in this way. He called it his c: water
dre~sing." Thfr. Liston, of London, and nlr. Symes, of Edin-
burgh, t\vo of the first surgeons of the day, have adopted it. in
preference to all lotions and ointments, in the treatment of
wounds~ ulcers, &c.
The application is of two kinds-<me, in which the wet linen,
when applied, is left exposed to the air, producing a cold or
a cooling sensation, by the free evaporation of the moisture
which it contains, or by renewing it frequently. The other,
from which the water is completely wrung out and carefully
protected from the air by a covering of dry linen. This is a
warm application, all free e\·aporation being prevented.
The first of these, or the cold fomentation, is used when
there is active superficial inflammation going on. It reduces
the heat, and diminishes the qnantity of blood sent to the part.
It is applied to the head when there is a determination of blood, .
inflammation, or delirium. It is assisted by the partial baths,
and wet sheet. It is used in compound fractures, and all cases
where a le:::;:::;ening of action, or the prevention of inflammation
b indicated.
The second, or warm fomentation, is the most soothing
application that can be applied to the external sentient surface.
In larcerated wounds, a.nd other injurie~, ulcers, &c., it has the
most healing influence of any application known.
The heating compre~s or fomentation is usually applied to
the abdomen in the treatment of nearly all chrome diseases,
more particularly where there is diseased action going on in
the liver, stomac.h, bowels and kidneys, or in the large ganglionic
nerve3 behind the pit of the stomach. It is used in the follow-
ing way :-A bandage sufficiently broad to reach from the pit
of the stomach, to an inch or two below the navel, and long
enoucrh to meet when passed round the abdomen; after being
dipped in cold water, it is :vru~g as ~early <~ry a.s it~c~n be; <;>Ver

In some instances it produces hysterical syrnptom::i in delicate
and excitable female~; in such cases, if it be otherwi::;e nece::.-
aary to wear it, i.t ::,hould b~ kPpt 01~ only for a~ hour or two at
a time, or wear 1t only wlule walkmg. By th1s management,
the nervon~ system of the digestive apparatus becomes gradu-
ally accustomed to its action.
Compresl:ies are worn on the chest for cough ; around the
throat for different forms of sore-throat; on the nape of tho
neck for inliamed eyes, &c., &c.
When this continued fomentation or ponltice has been
applied for some time, it draws to the ::;kin and general cover-
inG' of the abdomen, any undue action in the lining membrane
ol'the stomach and alimentary canal, reducing the irritation or
sub-inflammation; also by its soothing and sedati\'e properties,
and the renewed reaction on the skin each time it is replaced;
it regulates the bowels, by increasing the peristaltic motion,
and facilitating the expulsion of fc.eees. It relieves heart-burn,
spasms, and the train of symptoms accompa.nyng bad digestion.
After a time, more especially when there is a tendency to cri-
sis, the bandage, when washed, i:; fonnd to be saturated with
different secretions from the skin, making the water thick ami
turbid. And frequently a cnrious phenomenon takes place,
which bas not yet been explained. Arter the bandage has
been worn some weeks, there is a secretion thrown out on the
skin of the etomach and abdomen, of a beautiful dark blue
color; this continues fur a week or two; sometimes ceases sud·
denly for weeks, and returns again. It is of f1·eqnent occur
renee, and I have always found it of precisely the same color
As yet I have only s8en it in bad dyspeptic cases, and whe1~
mercury had been taken at some ]Jrevious period.
ThlS water-dressing is applied to eruptions, and different
kinds of local affections that appear during the crisis, to gouty
hands and feet, & '..
After a time, various forms of eruption appear on the skin,
from which exudes a glutinous liquid, accompanied with a
strong, disagreeable odor. l\ledicinal Rubstances formerly taken
are sometimes detectable in the secretion in question.
Similar phenomena take place on the application of com-
presses around the different joint~. The smell and color of
ointments and other applications that had been used a lon(J'
time previously are brought out by the compre~~ef;. ~
A patient under my care, in whom some of these strikinCJ"
effects occurred. was visited bv .Mr. Travers, an eminent and on~

pointed and had nearly reached the snrt:tce, the bandages were
found to be marked all over with yellow matter, although the
skin was perfectly whole. This continued for some weeks,
and the swelling disappeared.
There are a number of circumstance::; which guide in the
application of the compress as a remedy for immediate and
local uneasiness, or for the general disorder. Into these the
character of this work does not allow of entering upon.

DETAILS
THE 'NA'fER CURE.
WATER DRINKING.
WE now come to those details which more immediately op-
erate in changing the quality of the blood; and these are wa·
ter drinking, food, air, and exercisB.
A great n11muer of cases-of nervousnel's, for instance-de·
pend on irregular distribution of blood alone. In such, large
quantities of water are decidedly injurious, they augment the
nervousne::;~ tenfold. In another set of cases-those with
blood tending towards the head-they are decidedly dangerous.
Again, when the patient has a very irritable pulse, and is con-
stitutionally a person of vivid sensations, large water drinking
is rarely admissible. From three to six tumblers daily are the
limits in such instances as the abo\·c ; and that should be taken
in very divided quantities, a wine-glassful at a time being often
as much as is good. In all these cases, as \Vell as in some of
the worst instances of nervous indigestion, the great centre of
the nutritive nerves is so exquisitively sensitive, that the shock
of even half a tumbler of cold water npon the stomach is trans·
mitted to the brain and there causes giddiness, confusion, ner·
vous aching, &c., and this the more certainly the lower the
temperature of the water. On this account I have now and
then raised the water to 55° or 58°, when the drinkino· of it
was indispensable, until the nerves of the stomach b~came
more able to bear the natural temperature; and have been con·
BOled f0; the heresy therein implied by the benefit therefrom
THE WATER CURe 63
obtained. Por, as the external remedies d.euve from the inte-
rior to the exterior of the body, the stomach becomes less sen·
sitive, anu both the temperature and the dose may bl.! carefully
increased. Thi-.; stimulating properly of colu water taken in·
ternally should a.lway:3 be kept in mind. l\Iost of those who
know nothing, but assert a great dea.l, about the water cure,
say that water drinking lowers the powers of the body, whilst
many profes::::,ors of the water cure order such extravagant do·
ses of it as to make one think they consider it a very weak
agent. Both err in not recognizing the stimulating character
alluded to, and which requires due apportionment to individual
cases. The cold. of the water stimulates the blood-vessels of
the mucous membrane, and expels the blood from them. For
this reason it is that it is necessary to drink some wat~r after
every bath, this last always causing a flow of blood, for the
time, towards the internal membranes, to remedy which, cold
water is drunk and exerci:::e taken immediately. Indeed, with·
out these precaution~, the eA.iernal processes would fail in half
J1eir good effect, or be positively harmful. But if the blood-
vessels of the mucous membrane are excessively irritable, this
stimulation by the cold may cause violent reaction in them, ami
thus actually increase the quantity of blood in them. Here,
then, is a rea:-;on for care in the quantity of cold conveyed by
the water to the stomach. Further, the cold of the water stim·
ulates the extremities of the nerves which come from the brain
and spinal cord to the muscular coat of the stomach, and con·
vey sensations to and. from those parts. The result of tlus
stimulation is contraction of the muscular coat, and this con-
traction constitutes hunger, one of the well-known conse·
quences of cold water drinking. But here, again, if too much
cold be applied, thi::; contraction will amount to spasm of the
stomach, an event I have witnessed in not a few instances of
persons who treated themselves by cettain Water Cur~ tr.e~·
tises, which record the wonderful effects of wonderfulimb1b1·
tions of cold water.
Added to the stimulus of cold is the stimulus of \Veight,
which so hea\'Y a liquid as water cannot fail to afford; and to.
gether \Vith tlie weight, the bulk should be considereJ. It is
true, that absorption of the water speedily takes place ; but it is
more or le::;s speedily, according to individual pecul.iar~ties.
Very many suftcrers from nervousness .and ner~ou~ md1ges·
tion will give mark~ of very slow absorptiOn, by t'eJ~ctu~g a por·
tion of the water after an hour or more. Absorptwn IS qmck-
ened by exercise : but if the patient be distressed by too large
64 THE FRACTICE OF
a quantity of water taken at once, exercise. bec~mcs a ~ain1 ul
vr impossible thing to him. Between the mordmalc stllnula-
tiun of cold and of weight. and bulk, the stomach dt:-:tn•.;sl':-;, and
almost paralyses, the brain and seat of the will; wJJcrcas, if
taken in proper quantity, water is one of the most ctlectual su:;;-
tainers of the animal nervous system and of locomotion; rn:my
persons, whom walking before breakfast would clistre:;;s, arc
enabled to do so with comfort and alacrity by taking smalJ
draughts of cold water. Here, then, is another reason for Jis-
criminating in the prescription of water drinking.
Supposing the water absorbed and carried into the circul:t-
ting blood, it then proves a stimulus to every capillary bloc [-
vessel in the body. It thus quickens the great functions of n t-
trition, of deposit, and of waste, which are carried on in thel e
minute and mysterious extremities of the wondrous circulating
system. Quickening their office, it also quickens that of the r
great centre--the heart, and the pulse becomes more rapid wit 1
copious water drinking. But as a large proportion of the C:i·
pillaries of the body exists in the brain and spinal cord, their
increased function in those organs proves a source of augment·
ed nervous phenomena, the sensations becoming general)y
more vidd, and processes of digestion, &c., going on in the
viscera being felt, which the brain had previously failed to re-
cognize. Some excitation of the nervous system is unques-
tionably unavoidable in the course of rousing the self-restora..
tive power of the body; but the expositionI have briefly offered
of the mode in which water drinkmg operates on the nervous
and circulating systems may warn persons, as yet uninformed
of the science of the Water Cure, from the folly and hazard of
prescribing or taking the lmge doses of water which were at
first thought and taught to be essential in all cases of disease.
Still, as I have all along repeated, there are cases of torpid,
obstructed function, in which it is both safe and necessary to
prescribe copious water drinking. In these, nothing short of
considerable stimulation of the nervous and circulating sys-
te~s by the cold, the bulk, and the action in the capillaries im-
phed by the water, suffices to bring into pla.y the conservative
power of the body. But there is nothino· to fear for the head
or heart in such case~ ; the functions of both are far too much
oppres:;ed to be suddenly drh en to the other extreme. Yet in
no cases is it desira.b'e to swallow the twenty or thirty tum-
blers before breakfast "hich we are told are so delightful and
refreshing ; it is to be r.oped they were tumblers of short mea-
sure.
THE W.~TEl! <.:UllF. .
From wnatpreccrlcs, it is plain that water should be drunk in
that state of the stomach which best fits it to receive a.nd to
transmit its stimulus, as \Yell as to absorb it most readily. If
the stomach t.loe::~ all th,~se readily, a. sm:.1.ller quantity of wa-
ter produces a.n eqn:tl result with a larger quantity. lll o. less
favorable condition of the stomach. \Vhen the stomach is
empty. and ha~ been so for several hours, its nervous as well
as its absorb,•nt energy has accumulated, and the water stimu-
lates. and is ab~orbcd \Vith alacritr. \Vhen the brain has been
at rest for several honrs: it and the whole nervous system are
in the best state for receiving stimulation from the stomach.
Accordingly, these conditions obtaining for both organs in the
early morning, after sleep and before breakfast, that time is
best fitted for water drinking, the principal portion of which
should therefore be practised then. In other parts of the day,
for a like reason. water should be taken three or four hours
after meals, and after e,·ery bath or process whatever. Exer-
cise of some sort :o:;hould follow the drinking, iu order to pro-
mote absorption. If vPry much heated with exercise, the wa-
ter should he drunk very slowly. In mo:-t cases ofmucous in-
digestion, a tumbler of very cold water taken in sips an hour
and a half after a meal, or e\'en earlier, a.~si:::;ts the stomach,
heated and jaded by the process of digestion, in its laborious
function: this i~ the only exception that I a.m a.wal'e of, to the
rule of drinking with the stomach empty.
AIR AND EXERCISE.
As in the preceding article, so in this, I am compelled to
animadvert on the indi:.;criminatc rule, or rather no rule, that
has been imported into this country. Of air, indeed, it may be
said, that au invalid cannot have too much, provided it be of the
right temperature and hygrometric quality; ~catc~ o~ exerci~­

like ,, courlling" shoul<.l be avoided ; patients should have abun-

the day. The air of town.: i,:; inimical to the cure of chronic
disorders, except ~orne rare instances of that protean disea~e,
asthma. That of hill~ is the best, becan~e the most dry and the
most lStimulating; and it thereby aflects the greatest changes
in the blood. Low sitn'ltions, and even high situations with a.
clayey, retentive soil, mar very mnch the curati\·e process.
'fhe air of rooms in whic.h patients under the \Vater Cure
sit, should never, even in the winter, excet!d 55° or 58°; and
even lower is desirable. 'rhat of their bed-rooms should be ten
or fifteen degrees lower, and indeed can scarcely be too cold.
\Vhen the body is \\·arm with bed-clothes, air at 35° or 38° is
much more comluciveto sleep than that at 65° or 70°, to which
temperature some pcrr;ons raise the atmosphere of their bed·
rooms. Everybody, (especially excitable neuropathic invalids)
sleeps better in winter than in summer.
\Vith regard to exerci:)c, it must be regulated entirely by the
state of the patient'::; nervous system, and by the food he takes
and digests. H there be none of thzt uervommess which be·
gets tremulou~ness of mind and body, a•1d if the stomach allows
of the digestion of a. fair quantity of meat and other nutritious
articles: the patit~nt ought to walk a good deal in order to dis-
sipate the nervous energy and the aliment. To tell persons to
live low and take con:--tant exercise, or, on the contrary, to feed
them highly and keep them on the ~ot:t, with the view of
strengthening them (as I Jmvc lmown to be attempted,) is an
absurdity of which one would imagine an educated physician
incapable, did we not hear sometimes of the injunction to
"walk, walk, walk," being laid indiscriminately upon all pa·
tients ali~e. Only consider what part~ are drawn upon in the
act of walking. You bring into play the :-;cat of the will, the
brain, and spinal cord; exawine; therefore, what is the condi-
tion of those part-;, wbct!Jer it be one of irritation a.nd excessive
function, or of oppression and deiicient function; if tho former
you most unquestionably increase the irritation by exercise of
the wi1l in long walking, ju;;;t as you would infiame yonr ~ves
by prolonged use ofthem; if the latter, you do ri(J"ht to urrre"the
will into acti?n, in orJ~r to ov~rcome the opp~c~Eion. o But
\~hen you exc1te the bram and spmal cord by \valking, you ex-
ctte, by sympathy the great organic centre at the digesti\'e or
THE WATER CUl{E. 57
gans; so that it behoves to consider the state of those organs,
whether it be one of irritation and excessive function, or of op-
pression and deficient function. Now it so happens, that these
c<.nditions of the digestive organs correspond with similar
states of the brain and spinal cord, and that therefore the same
rule, as regards exercise, applies. Thus, in nervous indiges-
tion, it is not well to take long walks or great exertion, for
stomach and brain are acutely sensitive; whilst in congested
liver torpor, pervades both it and the seat of the will, which
should therefore be exerted in a strong and prolonged manner.
Not only so; exercise wastes the blood and the nervous energy
of the frame, and whence is a fresh supply to come 1 From
the food which the stomach is to digest. But if the stomach
cannot digest much food? Why, then you must not waste
that which the food and blood supply more quickly than they
can renew it. And this brings me to the proposition with
which I started, that the amount of exercise must be regulated
by the nen·ous energy, and the quantity of food taken and di-
gested. I know it is proposed, and in some places acted upon,
to eat a great deal, to walk incessantly, and to employ an im-
mense quantity of the roughest portion of the Water Cure, in
all cases. Very possibly this succeeds; but I know it cannot
succeed without a \'ast amount of disagreeables to be borne by
the patient; and I also know that cure is obtained with a regu-
lated amount of those means, and free from the greater part of
the disagreeables.
With this rule, regarding exercise, the practitioner will de-
termine whether walking, Tiding, or driving, be the appropriate
form of it, and the amount of each. It is only necessary to
add here, that in all cases where the patient's limbs are in
condition to walk at all, more or less of that exercise should
be taken after each bath; or failing the capability of walking,
artificial exercise, in the sl1ape of considerable friction of the
limbs, should be practised.
DIET.
Some writers on the Water Cure have made a boast, that nc-
restrictions in diet are required in that mode of treatme~1t,
There can be no doubt, that in the Water Cure, the nppet1t9
58 1' HE r J:lA C T 1 C B 0 f'
and digestive pJwer:-; augment so rn,pidly, that at au ea~·ly stage
of the treatment food can be taken more freely than 1n other
plans of treatmeuL : all the appliances havc that tendency.
But on the othr.r ha1u.l, experience gives me no room to doubt
th~t, by appropriate t·eg-ulation of the diet .to each case, resto-
ration is secured in much less time, and w1th much less of that
constitutional tnmn1t which harsh practice rouses. Accord-
in(}"ly, I have to forbid some patients the 11se of animal food
th~ee or four days in the week, and others for a week together :
to some I forbid all puddings, even farinaceous, after meat : to
others all vegetable matter but bread, &c. All this is subject
for weekly or even daily change; and it is impossible to lay down
r!lles applicable to all cases. Two facts I have particularly
noticed, that in some instances of digestive disorder the stom-
ach tolerates best stimulating food, which contains a good
quantity of nutriment in a small bulk, such as meat, bread,
beans; and that in other instances it is advisable to avoid food
of concentrated stimulus, and take that which contains smaller
amount of nutriment in a larger bnlk, as is the r.ase with vege-
table matters. As a general f<tct, it may be said that nervous
disorder of the digestive orga.ns is less tolerant of bulk than
inflammatory disorder; nothiug oppresses a nervous dyspectic
so much as a mass of vegetable matter; whilst animal food,
put into an inflamed ::;tomach, causes local pain, aud CXIJUi'Site
restlessness and distress generally. The practitioner, tlJNefore,
has to determine the particular state of the digestive organs,
and them choose between nntriment in a small space, which
stimulates by its concentration, and nutriment sprmu.l over a
large mass, which stimnlate::> by its bulk. Again, u.s to quan-
tity, he must be e::;pecially careful on tl1is hea.d, as on it depends
the amOLmt of exercise and of water proce:4ses. Here, again,
it is idle to attempt a general recommendation, except it be that
it is safer to be unuer than over the ma.rk. In no part of the
physician's office is more acuteness, firmness, and precision
required, than in this affair of diet. Persons who would shrink
from the utterance of an untruth in all other things, do not
scruple to evade and deceive in this; as if conscinus of the
extremity of mental feebleness displayed in the incapabili-
ty of resisting the desire \Vhich babies and brutes gratify
without control. \Vhen in good health a.nd stronu exerc1se of
body, it matters little as to the kind of food which man takes
nor is it desirable to starve; that would place him in the worst
condition for resisting the causes of disease; and thero is some
truth in the lines,

StilL it must be repeated, that all t tblcs of diet are general,
and th·tt the judicious e:..nd attentive practitioner mu~t prescribe
a di13t for each patient. There arc a few suggc:":)tion:5, however,
which, not referring to articles of food only, apply to all who
are undergoing the water treatment :-
1. Eat slowly, and chew your food well; otherwise you
leave the stomach to do the duty of the teeth as well as its own,
besides failing to mix a Rnfficient qnantity of saliva with the
food, which plays an imrortant part in digestion.
2. Drink no hot liquids: tepid arc the next best: and cold
the best of all: in fact, unless on special occasions, all liquids
to be drunk should be cold.
3. The less you drink of anything at meals the better: not
because the liquid dilutes the gastric jnice, as some have said,
but because it gives a stimulus to the secretory vessels of the
stom1.ch. different from that of the dry aliment which is the
right :5timuln-:, and the con="equence h; likely to be the secre-
tion of an improper g:1.stric juice.
4. Alter eating, let as little excitement as may be proceed
from the hra.in and spinal cord to the Atomach, as it may inter-
fere with digestion. Therefore: remain seated, if in the air,
the better~ or if you move, let it be slowly. For the same
reason, avoid all subject.:: which are a strain upon the mind :
take the thuughta of others in book3 of easy reading, rather
than exert your own.
5. Let five and a half or six honrs intervene between the
three meals of the da.y: and let the last he a scanty one. Two
hours and a h:llf shonld elapse between the evening meal and
bedtime. And the same time, at lea:;t, after any meal before
anv \Vater Cure proce:o;s is practised, except foot baths, which
may be taken as soon as you please. Sweating may be prac-
tised an honr after a meal.
6. Avoid frr1its at all times, except befure or a
t breakfast.
Dessert of any kind is inadmis~ible. It is better to avoid tea
alto<Yethcr, but if it be taken, it is safer at breakfa.st than in
the ~vening) the day being before you: \Vhcrcas it might make
the night wakeful.
7. About two hom·s after a meal, especia1ly dinner, the
.;tomach beinc:r heated and jarlerl with (ligestion, is pleasingly
:-I
62 TilE l'RA~TJC£ 01'
stimulated bv a ~mall tmnbl,•r of very cold water taken in sips,
as you wotrld take wine. It gives a fillip to the muscular
coa.ts of the stmnach, which then contract, and expel any ~ur
that is t.listnrbing that organ.
\Vine and all alcolwlic lir1uors arc aul01Jg" the forbidde~:
things in the table. For a. man who has appetite cuough t~
eat a dinner of fish, tlc::,h, fowl, and sweet-., to :uld to thest:
~timulants that of four or five glasses of wine, clay after day,
is one of the mo:-t prcpo...terous cotwentionalities that social
extravagance ever invented. And yet to ~ec the ::-olemn regu-
larity with which it is done, one might fancy it w:ts an act of
supcrlativf' wisdom, im;tead of the Rtale routine of an ahsurd
and injurious custom. Pnt it in this way: either the stomach
has appetite, and docs not require the stimnlns of nlcohol to
make it digest, or it has not appetite= and shonld not have food
put into it to digest. \Vhere, then, is the necessity for the
daily wine-bibbing? Beside~, the stomach will only bear a
certain amount of stimulation, and if it rcceh·es it from the
wine. it is unable to receivc it from food al:-;o ; so th:tt the di-
gestion of the latter is materially interfered with by the former,
and the appetite for the stimulus of aliment diminished in pro-
nortion n.s thn.t of alcohol is applied. But it is an old tale to
repeat the nnmerons argument~ against n fooli:::h cu~tom, for
which there is but one argument-th1t it is a cn~tom. Of one
thing- I am convinced, that it i::; lcs;:; injnriou~ to drink a bottle
of wine once a week, nnd be sick after it, than to kPep up a
slow, ~mouldcrin:r irrit~ttion of the stomach, by two uttsscs of
the s:tm"' wine taken with ~tupid precision cvvry day " when
~he cloth is removed.''
If such is my creed rcga.rding vinous licptors for those who
are ir.. apparent health, the rea~on~ for avoidin.g it in those
who~~ viscera arr. a focus of irritation, as in chronic disease.
will be potent, and need not be detailed. I would not let thr
cpportnnity pass of exprcs~in~ my belief in the infinitely su
pcrior wi~dom of ab;;tincnce from alcoholic lir1nid' under ordi
nary circmnstanceP. of health and disease. Bnt were the case
.'n'! of c.xtrcme cxh·1 n~tion from loss of blllotl. or anv other

t:tte to ;vlministcr any winr. or ~pirit that \vas tH'arc~t ~ they

and, as such: m·1y be wisely employed in time and place; but

CLOTHING.
THROUGHOUT this work it has been shown that the essential
of all chronic discn.se is excess of blood in the internal organs,
to the detriment of the circulatory activity of the exterior of the
body, of the skin especially. On this fact the whole treatment
described in the preceding pages is based, and it renders the
clothing of the body a thing of some importance. It is an aim
to bring to, and fix in the skin, a quantity of blood which shall
both diminish the excess within, and render the skin more able
to react upon external agencies, cold, damp, electricity, &c.
Now this is not to be done by concentration of heat about the
skin: the more yon exist in a hot atmosphere, or in a mass of
fleecy hosiery, washed leather and triple coats, the less able
does the skin become to re-act upon cold, ~ncl the more, there-
fore, does that cold tend to drive the blood from the exterior to
the interior, and increa~e the congestion of blood there. It is
said that all thi=-- exces<:iYe clothing is to keep out the cold :
but, in thi-.; mo~t nn-.teady of climate.::;. at lea"t: tbe thermome-
ter varies from 5° to 20° in a da,·, and can it be said that the
same amount of clothing is neccs~ary in Loth temperatures?
On the contrary. the \·ery excess of covPring at the higher tem-
perature, render;; the skin exquisitely scnsiti\·e to lower tem-
perature, which comes on. very freqnrntly. in half an honr; if
the clothing i-: only enough at 60°, \vhat is it at 45°? or if it be
ju~t enouah at 45°, how excessive and eufcehling must it be at
60°! T;kcep the skin in active warmth by a quantity of un-
der clothin!!, is a. rno:::t fallacious and in,iurion~ attempt.
But further, a considerable amount of the wa::>te of the body
is effected by the :-:kin, and ~uch waste cannot ~o on without
free contact of the at!nospheric air~ contact wltich is matP.rially

cessary, as well as that of a.ir upon it: and it i5 therefore essen·
tial, on this score al::;o, to fix blood there.
Lastly. we ha.vc to consider t1~e enormot~s number of ~1en•es,
having their centre in the bram and spmal cord, wh1ch arc
spr~ad on r tl1c skin, and COirrey:::, :::,cn::;ation::; thence to the
bra.in. \Vben the skin is imperfectly supplied with blood, and
not reactive, all chnnces tell painfully tlpcn these uen es, and
in that manner keep the bmin in irritation from that source.
Now, a steady state of the cutaneous nerves cannot be ol>taincd
without ensnring a good and fixed supply of blood to the skin.
On every score, then, it is desiral>le to avoic.l all clothing
which shall have for view to keep the body in a state of artifi-
cial heat. The skin should be made jndcpendent in this re-
spect; its warmth should be the result ofthe chemical changes
actively going on in its actively circulating blood-vessels : and
its nerves should be able to throw off, by the 1·e-action of the
circulation, those sotuces of irritation which its subjection to
them proves so disordering to the brain and spinal cord. In
speaking of the wet-sheet pacldng I have endeavored to show
it quiets the brain by withdrawing the skin from all irritating
sources.
From all this it may be inferred, that exposure of the skin to
the free access of air is an e~sential part of the vVater Cure,
and that therefore the applkation of much warm under-gar-
ments is not to be practised. But here, again, reservation must
bs made regarding the organic capal>ilitics of each patient;
\Vhat is excess of clothing to one may not be so to another; and
to withdra\v the flannel jackets of f!very one who begins the
treatment, simply because he is a water patient, is a blunder
of routine which would materially thin the number of the prac-
titioner's successful cases. Look at the number of patients
who have not blood enough to supply the exterior as well as
the interior of the frame ; in such you cannot bring the blood
to the surface until you have made more of it: the attempt to
do it by trusting to the re-action to be produced on the admis-
sion of air to the bloodless skin, is enough to annihilate some
of those fragile inc.li viduals. Look abo at the numbers of pa-
tients who, although they have blood enough, have it centered
in the chronic irritation of the interior, and who, be:sides, have
had the skin hermetically sealed by flannel, or sill<, or leather,
for twenty or thirty years; to strip them of those coverincrs
simultaneously with the commencement of the water treatme;t
. '

mternal tTTitatwt: mto acttve and dangerous mfl.ammation. Ac·
T H E W A I E ~ C :r R E • 66
cordingly, I make it a practice in similar cases not to interfere
with the clothing until the appliances of the \Vater Cure have
wrought snch change in the body's organic state as to render
certain the power of the skin to generate its own sufficient
warmth without the necessity for retaining it by a quantity of
under clothing. This period varies in individuals, and I fre-
quently allow several weeks to pass before attempting a change.
lt must always be remembered, that a prolonged feeling ofphy-
sical misery, such as the abstraction of warm clothing is apt to
beget, is a state of malaise to the brain, which therefore re-acts
unfavorably on the rest of the body; and I hold that a patient
who suffers so much in that way, derives as much injury from
the miserable feeling as he can possibly derive good from the
free access of air to the skin. You must fill the skin before
you give it increased work to do.
Again, when you do begin to withdraw clothing, it is well to
do so piecemeal, especially in such cases as I have indicated.
In a climate like that of America, with its varying barometer
and thermometc1·, it appears to me more reasonable, ifadditional
clothing be necessary, to heap it in the shape of outer garments,
which may be donned and doffed with the vicissitudes of the
atmosphere. In withdrawing the under clothing from delicate
patients, it is often well to substitute some outer covering
when the temperature requires it, at evening or early morning,
until the skin is wholly able to support itself.
When, however, a full-blooded patient presents himself for
treatment, with, it may be, apoplectic fnlness of the head, active
irritation of the liver, or some similarly conditioned malady, in
which it is necessary to rcdttce the whole quantity of blood, as
well as re-distribute it, I have no hesitation in ·withdrawing the
flannel clothing at once and entirely. There is then no fear
that the air will withdraw more heat from the surface than the
interior can afford to renew ; and we also advance the process
of waste by the skin, which, in such cases, it is desirable to
obtain.
In any case, when once the withdrawal of extra clothing is
jud1eiously effected, it aids materially the progress towards re..
covery; it is both an evidence of past improvement, and ground
for more and more rapidly-arqnired improvement in the future;
the reasons for whieh arc u Je found in the commencement of
this article.

136 TilE PI:ACTll'E OF
H.\Bl'J'S OF LIFE.
'¥hen the nervous ~ystcm of nn individual has been long ha·
bituateu to the application of certain stimlllants, and to the im·
pressions of certain circumstances at certain periods of tile day
or hour, and \vhen, with tlH:ose, his health has gradually deteri..
orated and become aeriou~ly compromised, the witbtlrawal of
these periodical stimulants, and the alteration of these periodi-
cal circumstances, become an essential part of a plan of medi-
cal treatment which is professPdly hygienic. As in the medi-
cinal plan of treatment, the Vlllgar and ha.lf-educated practi-
tioners alone put their whole trnst in the drugs that are pre-
scribed; so in the water treatment, be has a vPry narrow and
vulgar idea of it who thinks that recovery is eiiected by the
bathing and \\·ater drinking alone, and leaves untouched the
habits of the patients. It is not the mind alone that is the
creature of habit, but every sentienl twig of a nerve, and every
irritable capillary blood-vessel of every tissue of the frame. Let
a man who has hitl1erto lain in bed until S A.IH., be rousctl at 6
A.lu., it is not his brain only that is etlected by the change, bnt
his appetite for breakfa~t is altered-he is thirsty, feverish,
shivering; his aptitude for his avocatwn is dirninbhecl, it is
more laborious to him: as a consequence, he cannot eat his
dinner so well, and so on through the day, and perhaps several
days of disagreeable revolution. The altered impression vn
the animal brain has told upon the organic centre at the stom-
ach. and thence has changed the organic action of the whole
frame. Gradua11y, however, both animal and organic systems
of nerves accustom themselves to the new order of things, to
the impression of Jight, sound, locomotion, &c.~ between the
hours of 6 ami 8 A.JH. ; and ina:::much as it is more in accord-
ance with the W"ishes of Nature, as exhibited in the human
body, that sleep sJwuld not be prolullg«·d htr into daylight, this
new arrangemrntof time for rising en~~ntnally, proves a whole-

lives, as nearly as cau be done in a countt·v callincr itself civili-

zed. after the manner of Nature, and he gets his reward in the
riches of health.
Now the sufferer from chronic disease who strl\·es to rid him·
self of it by the means of the \Vater Cure, mnst condescend
more or less to the natural habit of life. Jie must learn to
rise early, and to walk or work so as to gain appetite: when
this appetite is acquired he must eat, whether the hom be fash-
ionable or not: and he must go to bC'd early from the motive
of fatigue alone. And he will do all this in a very short time
and find pleasure in it. and look back on the former habits as
on a fevered dream. Let any one measure the time it took to
fall into the bad habits, and he \\'ill find that it takes a much
shorter time to fall into the new and good ones. And this pro-
cess is E-xpedited by the yarious details of the \Vater Cure
which have been passed in reviPw; each one, when properly
applied, adc!ing to the alacrity. impressibility and re-active en-
ergy of the nervous systems, in which and by which, habits are
formed and changed. Allusion has been alt·eady made to the
facility with which water patients abandon, not by degrees, but
immediately, the stimulus of wine, without expet·iencing any
disagreeable want. The same applies to previous habits of all
kinds. They are to the invalid a sort of stimulus, a stimulus
which his nervou~s system expected and responded to at certain
times, and flagged or fidgeted if they were not applied at those
times. The man who has been in the habit of dining at 7 P.M.
with all the forms, strong lights, 1iverieel servants, two or three
courses (though he, perhaps, only eat of one,) and one or many
guests, discovers when he is deprh·ed of them, that all these
accompaniments of eating were actual stimulants to his ner-
vous system, and that he cannot eat without them ; one course
the fewer. the absence of a guest, or even wearing a morn-
ing instead of an evening dress, makes all the difference in the
happiness and the appetite of this creature of habit. From
such wretched slavery as this: he may be emaucipated almost
immediately by the applications of the Water Cure, and with
little or no suffering to. the nervous system. For a rew· days,
he will feel a little queer, n.s if " somehow there was some-
thing somewhere wanting," but the withdrawal of intern~)
irritations, and the stimulation of water applied to the extreml-
ties of his nerves, and conveyed to their centres, verv shortly
68 THE Ill.ACTLVE Of
affords to the latter a sustaining action, which fully cvmpen
sates for that which the previous inJurious habits had supplied.
In this manner, the Water Cure becomes a lile::tns of eradi-
catincr unwhole::;ome, and of planting healthful habits in tlmse
who ~ubmit themselves to it. Nor is this confined to the body.
How frequently have I seen persons, who were dyiag of ennui
in the midst of the stimulating gaieties of London, find the day
all too short in this quiet village of 'Malvern ! I have seen
men, whose jaded and morbid minds could previously take no
nutriment save the garbage of English and French novels, de-
vour the strong meat of History and Biography with keen and
large appetite. And 1 constantly remind my patien_ts that the
treatment is renovating their minds as well as bodies, ridding
them of the silly wants and unmeaning necessities which were
in part the cause, in part the effect, of their physical disorder.
Doubtlessly, much of this is owing to the removal of that dis-
order which takes the weight off the mental function. But in
all chronic disease, there is more or less loss of volition, which
can only be roused by the necessity for acquiring some good
habit; therefore, although it were not directly essential to the
body's health to impose certain rules of life which require ex-
ertion of the will, inasmuch as they differ from previous habits,
it is well to insist upon them for the sake of their indirect op-
eration on the nervous system of the body; I am convinced
that the mere necessity of undergoing some process three or
four times a day, aids those processes in bringing about the
general re:5ult of health. And so far from this derogating
from the credit due to the Water Cure, I think it rather exhib-
its the philosophica1 character of that treatment which thus acts
on mind and body simultaneously.
With this general view of the operation of habits of life, and
ut the necessity of altering them, under the regime of the
Water Cure, it is unnecessary to enter into extended details :
and I shall only schedule a few of the more import.1.nt habits
to be dropped and to be adopted.
Early rising should be practised: the sun, the air, the exer-
cise, and the water drinking are all more beneficial then, than
at any other part of the day. No water patient should be in
bed after 6 A.J\I.
The longer the patient is in bed before midniO'ht the better
due time being allowed since the last p;evious r~cal. Physio~
logical experiments countenance the old saying, that" an hour's
sleep befor~ twelve o'c1ock is worth two after it.''
He should learn to sleep on a hard bed : for excessive heat

excites the nerves of the skin, an<l these convey the ex'!ite-
ment to tile brain, which thus becomes dreamy or rc:stlc~s. Six
hour::>· sleep is e11ough fo" excitable persons: phlegmatic and
impassible persons require sc\'en or eight hour::;. If you have
had either or these quantities, resi::;t further sleep : the second
sleep is seldom refreshing, and rather disturbing to the brain.
Avoid hut room:;, easy chairs, 1.nd lolling on sofas: all these
take from the energy and the vo_ition of the ne1·vous Rystem.
In order to keep the nervous system in wholesome play, let
all the day be accurately dh·ided by baths, packings, walkings,
readings, &c., and let each division be rigidly adhered to and
made a point of honor. In short, make a busiue:-:s of the whole
treatment; a business with a great aim at the end.
A\·oid extensive correspondence by letters, especially with
commiseratin~ friends. It so happens: that most friend::; express
themselves more anxious about your health than about their
own: pour faire vnloir which anxiety, they usually give you
dismal pictures of your condition, aud add warnings about the
"dreadful \Vater Cure.:' Attend to the \Vater Cure, ~ince
yon have undertaken it, and not to your fr!cnds.
Beside~ alcoholic !'timulants, give up the scarcely less delete
rious stimulus of tobacco, in the shapes of snntling and smok·
ing. Both tell injuriously on the nerves of the stomach a1
well as on the brain. In the German \Vater Cure e~tablish·
ments the patients smoke ; they abo eat som·krout and heav}
pastry: and, it is said, they get well. Be it so: but, I repeat
business-worn Englishmen are not heavy German!', and caul~
not safely bear the rough treatment which the indulgence it~
the::;e hurtful habits obliges in order to overcome the malady
Nay more, I defy any one to cure a rwr\'ous <.lisorder or a shat·
tercd constitution whilst the patient is allowed to snuff o\
smoke tobacco. I wonld have no patient who refn::;ed to give
it up: the physician should control, not pander to, his patient.
Other precepts regarding habits are suggested by individual
cases, into which it is too long to 0-nter in :t volume. The
above arc of general application : and, for the rest, it suffices
to state that all habits which strain the nervous ~ystem on the
one hand, or albw it to become torpid from want of ~mploy..
menton the other: are to ue aroided.
'70 THE rRACTlCE OT
ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS
URGED AGAINST THE
WATER 'l'RE!TIUENT OF tiiRONIC DISE!SE.
THE accusations advanced against the Water Treatment, ate
first stated at the heat1 of each section, and then answered.
As most of them lmvc beell maJe l>y medical practitioners,
generally of the apothecary kind, it is well to mark, that the
chief refutation of them i!= drawn from anthon; who J~servedly
stand high in the estimation of the medical world, whether of
the drug or water persuasion-authors whom mere apotheca-
ries never read.
1. "THE WATER TREATMENT ExHAJsTs THE ANIMAL
HEAT."
From this very ab~urd proposition, we might appeal to the
patients who have been treated at :
Malvern. The great rna·
jority of them arrive here with the skin so exquisitely alive to
any the smallest decrease of temperature, that, in some cases,
we found fires blazing in their r0oms in the month of August.
The same sensitivcnc:':" is te::;tified, and indeed maintained, by
the accumulation of nanncl, silk, and soft leather, in which they
are clothed on their arrival here. How is this to be accountetl
for? And how is it to he explainetl that, after a longer or
shorter trial o_f the \V~tcr Cure, these l;ame patients go out into
all weathers, m early morninrr and at night, throw aside their
multiplied under clothing: an/i' defy rain nnd snow, and keen

frost 1 'Ve propose, iu answer, to turn to tiLe pages of an au-
thority whicL our medical brethren will::;carc:ely gainsay.
Referring again to the doctrine of LEmiG, given when ad4
drm;sing ourselves to the question of "thin blood,, and which
makes the vital activity consist in the tran::;formation of the ele-
ments of the food into the blood: this again into the solids and
secretions, and the:se again into blood: containing carbon and
hydrogen, to be consumed by the oxygen of the atmosphere ;
-we find in the work of the same learned author, that the
source of animal heat is attributed to the same process of con-
sumption of the carbon and hydrogen of the food uy the oxygen
of the atmosphere. He says:
"The mutual action between the elements of the food and
the oxygen, conveyed by the circulation of the blood to any
part of the body. is the source of animal heat."
This being established, let us next ask by what means this
heat is maintained under varying circum~tances. And let the
same author answer:
"In the animal body the fo0d is the fuel; with a proper sup-
ply of oxygen we obtain the heat given during its oxidat:on or
combustion. In winter, when we take cxerc·isc in a cold
atmosphere, ::mel when con~eCJuently the amount of inspired oxy-
gen increu~es, the neces:;ity for food conhlining carbon and
hydrogen increases in the :=-arne ratio; anJ by gratifying the
appetite thus excited, we obtain the most efficient protection
auain~t the most piercing cold. _\.starving man is soon frozen
~death; and e\·ery one know::; that the animals of prey in the
arctic re!!'i·ms far exceed in \·oracity those of the torrid zone.
"In cold and temperate climates, the air, which is inces-
santly striving to consume the body, urgP.~ man to laborious
efforts, in order to fUI·ni!->h the means of resi:-tance to its action,
while in hot climate~, the necessity of labor to provide food is
far les:; urgent.
"Our clothing is merely an equivalent for a certain amount
of food. The more warmly we are clad, the lc::;:; urgent becomes
the appetite for food, bccau~e the loss of ~eat by cooling, and
consequently the amount of heat to be supplied by the food, is
diminished.
c: If we were to go naked~ like certain savage tribes, or if
in huntino· or fishing we were exposed to the same degree of
cold as tl~c Samoyedeti, we should be able with ease to con-
sume ten pounds of tiesh. anrl perhap,:; a dozen or tallow candles
into the bargain, daily~ as warmly-dad trJ.-rcllcrs h::t.ve related
with a~toni:-;hment of these people.
THE PRACTICE Of
"Accordino- to the preceding expositions, the quantity of
food is reguhtted by the number of respirations, by the tempera-
ture of the air, and by the amount of heat given offto the sur-
rounding m<.'tlia."
To apply this. Our " warmly-clad" patients come to 1\lal-
vcrn without appetite, and afraid of the ::5lighte::;t cold air. \Ve
subject them to the action of cold air, uy causing them in due
time to throw off their warm clothing: we further subject
them to the action of cold \\·atcr applied to the skin in the shape
of baths ;-and, lo! in a few days they get an appetite! How
this comesto pass,let the above quoted paragraphli say. \Ve defy
the whole medical fraternity to disprove the truths they contain.
\Vell, then; behold the patient \Vith an appetite,-in other
words, with the capability of supplying carbon and hydrogen
abundantly to the blood; behold him taking exercise, and thus
augmenting the number of his respirations, in other word~, sup-
plying oxygen to meet the carbon and hydrogen which his ap-
petite affonl::;; behold, in consequence of the mutual action of
these elements, an increased rapidity of supply and waste, of
vital activity and chemical cornbustion,-AND TJTEHEI:"Ol!E AN
AUGMENTED AMOv~T OF ANIMAL UE.AT.
But it may be said that all this applies only to the operation
of external cold, and affords no argument against the assertion
that the drinking of cold water abstracts the animal beat. This
is true, as far a~ the mere withdrawal of heat is concerned:
but the ultimate effect on the increase of food taken, and of
oxygen consumed, and therefore of animal heat generated, still
holds. Hear LEIB!G again : .
"The cooling of the body, by whatever cause it may be pro-
duced, increases the amount of food necessary. The mere ex-
posure to the open air, in a carriage, or on the deck of a ::>hip,
by increasing radiation or vaporization, increases the loss of
heat and compels us to eat more than usual. The :-;arne is
true of those who are accustomed to driuk large quantities of
cold water, which is given otf at temperature ofthe body, 98·5.0
It increaPes the appetite, and persons of weak constitu-tion find
it necessary, hy continued exercise, to supply to the system the
oxygen required to restore the heat abstracted by the cold
water."
\Vhat ca_n be more confirmatory of the philoc::ophical princi-
ples o~ \\duel~ tf1e \yater Cure. proceeds than tllis proposition
of so JUstly dtstmgmshed a wrater? J\nd every wcml of it is
practically proved on thetie .Malver11 }Jill~: where. hv <.'Xt?rcise

drinking wr..ter, the capabilities of taking foad a.nJ ~f resisting
cold are gained for those who heretufora possessed neither.
To hear the absurdities uttered on this subject, one might be
led to imagine that the evolution of animal heat was a process
carried on to a very scanty degree in the human body, and that
the quantity of it generated in twenty-four hours in an adult
man, would be utterly expended on the water of the shallow
and hip-baths taken in that period. The non-professional
reader will, therefore, be snrprised at the following statement,
made on accurate experiments undertaken by natural ohilosQoo
phers of the highest character.
"According to the experiments of DESP.R.ETZ, 1 oz. of car-
bon evoh'es, during its combustion, as much heat as would
raise the temperature of 105 oz. of water at 32° (the freezhng
point) to 167°, that is, by 135 degrees; in all, therefore, 105
times 135°=14207 degrees of heat. Consequently, the 13·9
oz. of carbon, which are daily converted into carbonic acid in
the body of an adult, evolve 13·9 :><: 14207°=10747·3 degrees
of heat. This amount of heat is sufficient to raise the tem-
peratm·e of 1 oz. of water by that number of degrees, or from
32° to 197509·3°; or to cause 136·8 lbs. of water at 32° to
boil: or to heat 370 lb::;. of water to 98·5" (the temperature of
the human body;) or to convert i!Ito vapor 24 lbs. of water at
98·5° ! If we now assume that the quantity of water vaporiz·
ed through the skin and lungs in twenty·four hours amounts to
48 oz. (3lbs.,) then there will remain, after deducting the ne-
cessary amount of heat, 146380·4 degrees of heat, which are
dissipated by radiation, by heating the expired air, and in the
excrementitious matters.,
Why here is heat generated by one indhridual in twenty-four
hours, almost sufficient to boil the water in which he bathes,
and that which he drinks! And yet persons calling them-
selves educated medical practitionets and physiologists, talk
about the Water Cure« exhausting the animal heat!"
Should; however, the reader desire to learn the most effectual
way of destroying the power of genera~ing. anima~ heat, let
him pursue the plan which so many shtvermg patients who
come to Malvern have followed. Let him drink spirits and
wine, eat condiments, swallow purgatives, and especially mer-
curials take "a course of iodine,·' and, as an occasional in-
terlude: lose a. little blood ; and we sta.ke our :-eputation that
he will shiver to his heart's content, and find himself many
debrrees lower in the scale of Fabrenh~it than ccl~ water, cool
air, early rising, a.nd exercise can posstbly place hlm.
74 THE PRACTICE OF
2. "THE WATER CuRE DEsTnors THE T. NE OF TH£
STOI\IACII.''
Js it the cold of the water imbibed which destroys the tone 7
How then comes it to be given, by univensa.l consent, in fevers,
where the tone of the stomach i:s already low enough ? !::1
there a physician in these days bold enongh to assert that warm
water destroys the tone of the stomach less tht'm cold ? \-Vhere
is the tone of the stomach in gout? Yet from HAYDEN down-
wards, cold water is the recognized beverage for gouty persons,
Dr. PEREIRA tells ns that the drinking cold water "f<teilitates
the reco\·ery of epilepsy, hysteria, and fainting, and alleviates
gastric pain and spasm;" and further, that "large draughts of
cold water ha\•e sometimes caused the expulsion ot intestina
worms ;"-effects which, we submit, it could not have pro1luced.
had the cold water had the result of " destroying the tone of the
stomach." He also states, that " ice-cold water, or even ice,
when swallowed, causes contraction (certainly indicative of
increased tone) of the gastric blood-vessels, and thereby checks
or stops sanguineous exhalation (certainly indicative of de-
creased tone) from the mucous membrane of the stomach:"
that on taking icP, or ice-cold water. "temporary contraction
of the alimentary cana.l i~ produced: that a feeling of warmth
follows that of cold in the pit of the stomach, and quickly ex-
tends over the whole body, (so it does not exha.ust the nnimal
beat!) accelerating som~what the circulation and promoting
the secretions of the alimentary canal, of the kidneys, and the
skin." Finally, the same elaborate writer says of cold water,
that" it is a vital Btimulns, and is more essential to our exist-
ence than aliment." In all which we are at a loss for any
signs of destructio'1 of the stomach's tone.
Is lt by djlution of the gastric juice that colu water impairs
the tone of the stomach'? rhe last cited author seems to
th11:'l{ the affirmative, when he says, " Water serves at least two
important purposes in the animal economy; it repairs the loss
of the aqueous parts of the blood, caused by the action of the
secreting and exJ1·tling orga,ns ; and it is a solvent of various
alimentary substances, anrl thel'cfore assists the st( mach in the
act of digestion, though, if ta.ken in very large quantities, it
may have an oppusite effect, by diluting t1
te gaatric juice."
Unfortunately for the truth of this proviso, with reference ~o
the Water CLue, no medical man practising it as he ouo-ht to do
would prescl'ibe cold water to be drunk " in very large qHanti·
11-TE W.A£ER CURE. 76
ties'' at a meal, nor for two hours at least afterwards; en the
contrary, not more than a small tumbler ::lhonld be taken whilst
eating. And, as regards copious (hinkinCT of it when the stom-
ach is empty,-in the early mornina, fo; instance, when it is
especially recommendable,-we ha~e the best authority for
saying, that no gastric juice at all is secreted in the stomach,
until the natural stimulus of nutritions aliment is applied to
its cavity,* and therefore no dilution of 1t can take place, and
no diminution of tone thence be caused.
Lastly, is it by its bulk that cold water impairs the tone of
the stomach ? If the six or eight tumblers of water, imbibed
by a person before breakfast, all remained in the stomach un-
absorbed, its bulk would probably irritate the stomach to the
point of vomiting, and the exhaustion of the stomach subse-
quent on such effort, frequently repeated, might induce atony
of jts coats, as repeated vomiting from any cause tends to do.
But this cannot take place in the course of the \Vater Cure ;
first, because its practice does not countenance the taking of
more than one tumbler at a time, and insists on exercise in the
intervals between each; and, secondly, because it is well ascer-
tained that the absorption of water by the stomach is a sur-
prisingly rapid process, "all drinks," according to Dr. BEAU-
IUONT, "being immediately absorbed, none remaining on the
stomach ten minutes after being swallowed.,, vVe heard a
medical practitioner, who had seen a case simihr to that of St.
Martin, (a perforation from the surface of the belly into the
cavity of the stomach.) say, a short time ago, "that the suck-
ing up of water by the coa.ta of the stomach, resembled the
manner in which rain is taken up by the burning sancls of a
desert." And all physiological investigation proves that the
empty stomach has amazing vivacity of function in this particu-
lar. For the rest, we are contented to refer again to the words
of LIEBIG, that " large quantities of cold water increase the
appetite;" and to the daily exhibition of this fact in onr patients.
And we therefore contend that that which a11.gments the appetite
of the stomach cannot be destructi~;e of its toile, It we~·e well
for manhlnd, had they no more effectual way of destroymg the
tone of the stomach than by drinking wa' cr!

WE place these opinion~ in juxta-po~ition, in order that the
reader may form some idea of the anilitie~ which mere preju-
dice is capable of uttering. Here a.re two ~t.ates : one sup-

who hold by the retention of the water in the body, and those
who assertwits too rapid exit therefrom, at ease on both points.
Two kinds of drop~y arc described by all medical writers on
the subject: that which a.ri::)es from inth.mmatory, or some
analogous action in the seat of the drop:-,ical collection (the

ensues upon obstruction of the cir~ulatio11 uy reason of disease

BRIGHT, CnmsTr::::ox, Gn.EGOI~Y, 0.5UOit~E• .i\Lu!'l'lN, ~OLO~, and
RAYER, to be connected in :,ou1c instance.:) with a particular
organic disease of the kiuncy ; of which we shall by and by
say more. \Yith whatever condition, howe\·cr, of the dropsical
part the dbease may ba allied, one fact is in\'ariab1c in the his-
tory of dropsy, Yiz., the diminished actiou uf the kiuneyB, and
therefore the diminished quantity of tluid evacuated by them;
a diminution of which patients in the \Vater Cure, we venture
to say, never yet complain·'u. Referring to the dropsy con-
nected with local inflammation, we find the greater number of
authors attributing it to suppression of the perspiration, or of
any of the natnr.d secretions and discharrres, anti to the drivinO'
in of any eruption. Referring also to
0
the dropsy dependent
on disease of the heart, lungs, liver, &c.: we find all medical
writer;:; expla.in~ng this by the stoppage of the circulation in
consequence of obstruction::5 in tho::.e organs, and the subse-
quent congestion of blood and effusion of its watery parts in
some of the ca.vities. But in all the treatises on this disease
f~om HrP.rocn..A:rEs dO\~nwa_rds, the- medical or the non-profes~
s10nal reader will seck tn vam for the use, or even the abuse of
water a::; a cause. It i;; true that many of the older writers tor
tured their dropsical patients (who are alway~ thirsty) by for-
biddin~ liquids ; but every prartitioner is now well awa.r~ of thn
THE WATER CURE • 7'7
•t.~.·-urdity, and even injury of the restriction, which, however,
.)till obtains as correct with very many of the laity. Upon this
;rroneous and injurious notion, the opinion that " water drink·
ilg causes drop.sy" is calculated to play, as they who emit it
well know. But would any educated practitioner venture, in
a case of dupsy, to at upon such a notion, and debar his pa·
tient from 1.s much water as he chose to drink ? \Ve opine
that he wo .1ld be pointed at as an ignoramus and scouted by
his brethren for his utter want of scientific and practical know·
ledge. If, then, the free taking of water be not conducive to
the increase of dropsical disease, when the kidneys and skin
are carrying off liquids imperfectly, how should it produce
dropsy when both the kidneys and skin are acting freely-nay,
carrying off more than the usual quantity of fluids by virtue of
the exercise enjoined in the 'rVater Cure 'l The proposition
carries absurditv on the face of it.
But we furth-er maintain, that in those cases wherein the
dropsy is attributable to obstruction of circulation in the liver,
spleen, or sweet-bread, the copious drinking of water, aided by
the other applications of the Water Cure, is a powerful agent
in the cure of dropsy. If there be a diseased state which our
plan of treatment is more especially calculated to remove, it is
to be found in that obstruction of the liver and other solid or-
gans of digestion, which, in the majority of instances, gives rise
to dropsy. Of the removal of such obstruction, we have already
given the rationale. And inasmuch as in the case before us,
the dropsy is attacked in its source, and the torpid liver, &c.,
put into action, we have good reason to prefer the Water
Treatment before that which only aims at stimulating the kid-
neys by all kinds of irritating diuretics, leaving the original
seat of the mischief in the liver to take its chance, or, possibly,
to be deteriorated by those very diuretics (calomel, colchicum,
squill, and so forth) applied to the stomach.
This leads us to the consideration of that species of dropsy
which is connected with the organic disorder of the kidneys
denominated "granular disease," and described by BRIGHT,
CHRISTISON, and others. vVben it is alleged that the 'rVater
Cure causes disease of the kidneys, we are not aware that par-
ticular allusion has been made to this "granular'' condition ;
-very probably, they who pronounce the opinion never heard
of such a condition. But as medical writers have never yet
spoken of any other state of the kidneys as productiv~ of dropsy,
we conclude that the disease in question is the one mtended to
')e sePn throu$!h the hate of prejudiced ignoranc.e which sur-

spirituons liquors; 3, the employment of stnnulant dmrc>ltc~ ;
and 4, courses of mercury. But none of them ;dlude in any
way to copious dilution with water as a cause.
\tVith regard to the suppressed action of the skin. it can
scarcely obtain in the Water Cure, where the increased action
of that important surface forms a prominent feature, and where-
in sweating is a principal agent. On this last, indeed, Dr. 0::;-
BORNE places his greatest reliance in the cure of dropsy: as-
serting that "sweating being accomplished, the disease, if free
from complications, never fails to be removed.''
Neither do spirituous liquors figure in the Water Cure,
which may, therefore, quoad hoc, be declared guiltless of caus-
ing renal dropsy. Why do not our medical brethren, who utter
warnings aboutwater and dropsy, raise their voices on the sub-
ject of spirits and dropsy ? for all the writers above cited speak
of spirit drinking as (he most fertile canse of this kind of drop-
sical disorder, which, according to Dr. BRIGHT, destroys not
less than five hundred persons annually in London alone.
Then, as regards the employment of stimulant diuretics,
they enter not into the simple pharmacopreia of the Water
Cure. Dr. OsnonNE states, that these medicines, as squills,
cream of tartar, and even the diuretic salts, arc not guiltless in
contributing to the production of this disease of the kidney ;
and that by over-stimulating the kidneys, they become the
means of stopping the urinary secretion, and inducing the re-
nal disease and its consequences. And Dr. GnEGORY, in his
report of cases, says, 1
' that the most remarkable diminutions
in the urinary secretions took place after the administration of
squills and cream of tartar:" evidently pointing to their effect
~n exasperating the malady. Further, in quoting these authors,
1t is neceseary to remark, that they speak of the " stimulant
dmretics," and particularize some of them, as above. The lai-
cal reader will understand the force of this when he learns that
diuretics are classed by physicians into the "aqueous" and the
"stimulant,'' the latter including the saline, the acrid, the olea-
ginous, &c. It is not probable that accurate writers should
have passed over the ":u1ueous" diuretics had they been detec-
table as a source of dropsy from the cause in question; the
rather as, besides simple water, these include the infusions of
simple herbs and grain~, co'1iously imbibed. So that, taking
'f H E W A ·rE R C U R E • "'9
authority of a high character, that terrible agent, water, does
not prodnce dropsy so frequently as those pleasant medicines,
sqnills, colchicum, &c.
Lastly. a reviewer in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical
Journal, (supposed to be PROFESSOR CnRrsTrso~,) accuses
mercury of causing- diseased kidney leading to dropsy, and
alludes to Dr. .BLACKALL's observations to the same effect.
He says: "Two decided examples, if not more, we have seen,
in which no doubt could be entertained as to the influence of
this mineral in producing the morbid degeneration of the kid-
ney. MercLrry seems in this case to act very much like othet·
excessi\·e stimulants, and by over·exciting the glandular part
of the kidneys, to lay the foundation of the morbid change."
Sir AsTLEY CooPER also classes mercury as a not infrequent
cause of dropsy of the belly, speaking of it in that agency as
'by no means an extraordinary case."
Still we have nothing of water in all this; and mercury is
assuredly no part of the \Vater Cure. The fact is, and edu-
cated medical men know it, that when a large quantity of wa-
ter is introduced into the circu]ation, it passes off by the skin
in the shape of sweat, if external heat be applied: or by the
kidneys. if the surface be kept cool, this being a process of fil.
wring only, and un:tecompanied by the stimulation which
m:trks the operation of saline and acrid diuretic~: whose aim is
to force the kidneys at the expense of other organs. It re-
quires no depth of reflection to conclude which is the more
likely to bring on renal dropsy. We may add, by way of rider,
that Dr. CoPLAND enumerates "the dras'ic operation of pur•
gatives" among the causes cf dropsy : tat does not placo co-
pious dilution in the list.
ao 'l'HE !RAt'TJCE OF
PROPOSITIONS
ON
THE P~INCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF THE
WATER CURE.
I. A series of unnatural symptoms constitute a disease.
IT. This disC'ase is referable to a morbid condition of some
of the textures of the body.
ill. All disease is originally acute, that is to say, the symp-
toms arc more or less rapid and pressing in their character, and
more or lc~s characterized by fever.
IV. Acute di~ease i::; the effort of the morbid organ or organs
to throw off their disorder upon some less important org:m or
organs. 'rhus acute inflammation of the liver, stomach, or
lungs, causes fever, that is~ a.n effort to throw the mh;chicf on
the skin, the bowels, or the kidneys.
V. If: from the great extent of the mischief to be thrown off,
and the feeble r.onstitution, acquired or natnral, of th.e indi-
vidual, this effort is not successful, the body dies froln ex·
haustio11.
'/I. If this effort be only partially succe~sful, more nr less of
the internal mischief remain", but give::: rise to :-:ymptoms of a
less rapid and pressing and more permanent char.tctcr. These
symptoms then constitute a chronic di:;easc.
Vll. Except in the case of accidents to the lin1h~, we know
of no disease which is not essentially internal. Skin disease..
THE WATER CURE. 81
are i~variably connected with disease of some internal organs,
espec1ally the stomach and bowels, anu are regulated in their
character and intensity thereby. This is so true, that where
there is a skin disease, the crisis effected by the Water Cure
invariably tak<>s place on the spot where it exists.
VIII. Acute disease, then, is the violent effort of internal and
vital organs to cast their mischief on external and less impor·
tant organs.
JX. Chronic disease is the enfeebled effort of the same or-
gans to tho same end.
X. But as from the diminished power ofthe constitution this
is always ineffectual, the morbid state of the organs tends
constantly towards disorganization, or what is called organic
disease. This is more certainly the case, if the original causes
of the malady are at work.
XI. Disease therefore is curable when the power of the sys-
tem is sufficiently strong to throw the morbid action from a
more to a less important organ.
~·n. Disease is incurable when the power in question is
insufficient for the last-named purpose ; and when it has become
organic, that is, when a change of structure has taken place.
XIII. From these premises it follows that the aim of scien-
tific treatment should be to aid the development of the power
of the system and its efforts to rid its vital parts of mischief.
XIV. That mischief invariably consists in the retention of
an unnatural quantity of blood in them, to the detriment of
other parts of the organbm,-a retention commonly known bj
the terms acute injlammatwn, chmnic injlammalion, a.nd co~­
gestion.
XV. In eudea.voring to develope the powers of the system,
the dissipation of this inflammation or congestion mnst be con-
stantly kept in view, as the enrl of which the constitutional
efforts are the means.
XVI. But as the circulation of the blood everywhere is under
the influence of the organic system of nen'es, the power and
efforts of these last are essential1y to be strengthened in order
to dissipate the inflammaliou or congestion referred to. .
XVll. Curative treatment is therefore made through the In-
strumentality of the nenrous system.
XVIII. Violent and sudden stimulation of the nen•ous system
of the internal organs, is invariably followed by exh~ustion ~nd
increased inflammation and congestion. Hence the 1mpropnety
of nlcohoHc and medicinal stimulants.
XTX. But thf' gradual and judir.1ously regulated stimulation
.5

of the nervous s\·stem accordinu to the org-anic powers, con·
ducc!=; to the de~:eiopment and maintenanc~ of its ~tren~h: .
XX. This stimulation is the more steady aml CC'rtam m 1ts
re::;ults the more universally it i::; applied to tlw cnttre nervous
sy::>t<'m. . .
XXI. To the external skm, therefore, and to the mternal
skin (as represented uy all the lining membranes of the lungs
and diuestive orn·ans,) thi:-; stimulation should be applied, those
t:l t:l • fl
parts containing the largest portion o t 1e nen·ous system
spread through them.
XXII. Pure uir applied to the lungs, proper diet, and water
applied to the digestive organR, and water applied to the exter-
nal skin, fulfil this intention of stimulation and strengthening
most etfectually.
XXIII. Further, as that portion of the nervous system (the
brain and spinal cord,) in which the will re,ides, requires the
development of its powers, exercise of the limbs is requisite,
the stimula~ion of the air, diet, and water aiding thereto.

TION', CO~SISTS THE SCIE~TIFlC AND THE SAFE PRACTICE OF THE
\VATER CuRE.
XXVI. As strengthoning of the system by the reuulated
stimulating of the ucn·ous system is the means, so the
0
throw-
ing off' disease by more important on less important organs by
that acqmrcd strength, is the end of that practice.
XXVli. During the efforts of the system thus aroused for
so beneficial an end, if agents are employed which divert those
efforts and tend to centre stimulus on the more import.·mt or-
gan:::, augmentEd mi:o:chief is the certain result. Such auents
arc to be found in alcoholic and medicinal stimulants, applied
to the internal skin and nerves: in hot and intpure air applied
to the external skin and nerves; anu in excitinO" and factitious
pleasures and aiLxions care:; applied to the grc~rt contre of the
nerves, the brain.
XXVIII. These and the mal-apportionmeut of the stimula-
tion included in water, air, diet, and exercise, give rise to the
only" Dangers of the Water Cure.:•
THE WATER CURE. 83
XXIX. The proper apportionmentof the stimulation in ques·
tion originates and maintains a steady effort of the system to
save its vital parts at the expense of parts which implicate life
less immediately.
XXX. The result of this eilort is shown iu one of the fol·
lowing ways: 1, the re-establishment of obstructed and sup•
pressed secretions ; 2, in the elimination of diseased matters
through the bowels, kidneys, or skin ; 3, in the formation of a
critical action of some sort on the skin.
XXXI. Such resnlt constitutes the CRISIS OF THE WATER
CunE.
XXXII. The Crisis being the result of the extrinsic efforts
of the vital organs, is to be viewed as the signal of their relief,
not as the instrument of their relief.
XXXIII. Still as, during the crisis, the tendency from the
internal to the external organs is most strong, it is more than
ever necessary to avoid the causes which act in diverting this
tendency and in reconcentrating the mischief on the internal
parts.
XXXIV. At the same time, the tendency in point being
then strongly established, it is not necessary to stimulate the
system further in that direction, and all treatment except that
which allays irritation accordingly ceases.
XXXV. A crisis being the evidence of cure of the internal
disease, no recurrence of the latter is to be apprehended, unless
the morbid causes are re-applied.
XXXVI. It is, however, possible, and in a great number of
cases happens, that complete recovery from diseal:e is effected
by a slow process without any perceptible evidence of ~ <l'isis,
either external or internal.

GENTLEI\IEN'
As I am firmly convinced that I owe my present E:tate of
health, and even my existence, to your instrumentality, it be-
comes a pleasing tluty to me to record hy letter, as my friend
Mr. 1\'Jarsh has done, the benefit I have experienced from the
system of treatment you adopted in my late illnass. This duty
is further pre~scd upon me bythe knowledge I have, that many
are deterred from trying the Water treatment in conseqnenn}
'l' H T. W A T E lt C U R E . 85
of fears reganting its u:.tngers,-fears which my case amply
shows to be totally without foumla.tion, when it is scientifically
applied. PrcvionR to coming to ~Ialvern, I was considered by
some c" the mo:st cmineut of the f:lcnlty to be in a hopeless
&tate. ... mention this in evidence that it wa:S not my fears for
myself which exag-gerated the gravity of my sufferings; what
the::;e ·were I neeJ not detail. Suffice it to say. that when I
came under your care I was nearly reduced to a skeleton,-
tha.t the spasms of the stom'.lch, aml the gpasm::; about the heart,
seemed to threaten me with sudden death, and that only a few
nights after I reached ~lal\'ern, and before I commenced the
Water Cure, I was for :;evera.] hours in a state of insensibility.
In cshort, I did not consider my life safe from hour to hour. At
this time, after nearly three months of treatment, my body is
well covered with hard, o;;olid flesh, my appetite and sleep are
good, and my other functions in excellent order. The kimlne::;s
~.nd confidence with which you undertook a case so forlorn as
mine, backed by the attention displayed iu the treatment of it,
deserve and haxc my grateful remembrance. But indepen·
dently ofwhat I have experienced in my own person, of the uene-
fit..c:; to be derived from your mode of treating disease, when
other modes were confessedly of no avail, I have seen enough
in a number of the cn~es of others under the \Vater Cure at
rtlalvern~ to con\'incc me of its perfect safety and superior effi·
eacy; and I tru~t that thi~ short letter: which yon are at liberty
to nse as you please, may induce many :;utlerer::; like myself to
profit by a trial of it. I shall be too happy to make this state-
ment wherever I go.
I remain, gentlemen, yours truly obliged,

P. S. As to the physical annoyance in the \Vater Cure, that
1 heard so much about, I can only ~ay that I found, even in my
weakly state, every part of the treatment I underwent anything
but disagreeable, particularly lying in the wet ::;beet: indeed, I
found it so exceedingly plea~ant, that I regret much that you
diticontinued it the last five days before my departure from :Mal-
\·am. I may abo observe that I have not taken medicine of
any description since I first consulted you.

GOUT.
l\L\LVERN, S~PT. lG'fH, 1H44.
~fy DEAR Sm,
l cannot leave l\Ial\'ern without again expre:::~ing to you my
thanks for the encouragement you gave me to try the etfect of
the Water Cure, as you practice it, and for your kind attention
to me during the time I have undergone the treatment.
I have now gone through thP perspiring process, followed by
the baths, fifty times, with the )ther parts of the tretLttnent; I
found them anything but disagreeable; indeed, I may say, quite
the reverse ; and they have been most beneficial to me. During
nine months before I came here, I was never able to move
without my crutches, and tt great part of that nine months, I
passed in my bed or on the sofa. My nights were rc3tlcss, my
pulse high, and my tongue charged. I am now turned sixty-
three years of age, and have been subject to the Gout more than
forty years. I paid little attention to it the :first twenty years,
and as soon as the fit was over, I never missed taking my wine
daily. l\Iy knees, hands. and otb...er parts were so crippled, that
I had made up rny mind to pass the rest of my days \n my arm-
chair or bed, or to hobble about with my crutches.
The effect of the tn?atment has so ameliorated my situation,
I can now go up and down stairs with ease and comfort, with-
out a stick, and thP. other day walked half a mile on the high
road. I frequently Tide on horseback four hours a-day, and my
general health, I thank God, is as well as ever it was in my life.
I sleep well, my appetite is good, I can use my arms freely, and
tie my neckcloth, a thiug I had not been able to do for years ;
in fact, I feel myself comfortable and independent. Had I come
here a year ago, and undergone the same process, I have no
doubt but I should have saved my left knee from being con-
tracted; as it is, I am content to walk a little lame, and shall
be too happy to remain in the same state I am in at present for
the rest of my days. Pray excuse this long scrawl, as I know
you have not a minute to spare, and believe me,
My dear sir, yours most truly,

~orne years ago, being my.5elf in pur~uit of health, I accom·
panied the late Right Hon. Lord l!~arnha.m on the continent as
his physician. He suficred from gout, lmt died from Lhc effects
of dosing with colchicum. It was an intere:;ting and marked
case of the destructive effects of that pernicious drug.
11\IPUISSA.NCE, COMPLICATED "WITH GOUT, ETC.
T he uncle of the reigning Duke of Nassau, between sixty
and seventy years of age, had been affiicteu with gout so
severely, that when he arrived at Graef~mberg, he was almost
bent double. In addition to this be had become impuissant.
He remained for two years, married while there, and in due
time became the father of two children; and was, moreover,
perfectly cured of gout.
The aboYe case of Ilis Serene Highness Prince Nassau, as
related by Dr. E. Johnson, was con::;idercJ beyond the reach of
any remedial measures. \Vhen he commenced the \Vater
Cure treatment, his prospect of marrying- was about as great as
that of his being Emperor of Austria. All his joints were crip-
pled with ~out, and it had already slightly attacked hi::; heart and
brain. \\hen I left his Highne.ss his recovery was nearly com-
pleted. This case was nearly as hopele~s as that of Probart.
This letter was given by l\Ir. Ca::e, (a gentleman well and
~steemedly known in the county of Lancashire) to Dr. Came-
ron, in consequence of inquiries which the latter was making
for some noble patient in London. Dr. Cameron sent me the

quest to communicate shortly respecting my own sufferings
from gout, and the effects produced on me during my sho~t visit
to this place, using the cold water remedy under the adnce of
Dr. \Vilson. I have been a m1.rtyr to gout from a. very early

age and have already reached my sixty-lifth year. From the
yea~ 1816, I have generally been atta_cketl ~eriodi?al~y, spring
and autumn. the violence and suffenng of the fit mcreasc1l
yearly. 'l'he.joints of my.h~nds, feet~ ancles, knees, and elb~m s,
much enlarged, and contamwg chalky matter, and the legs hable
to be mnch swollen at night after exercise. I left my own
house ThinCYwall Hall, near Liverpool, on Friday morning, the
' 0 l .
7th instant, and consulted the doctor on t 1e same eycnmg, com-
mencing operations on the following morning, viz., the blankets
and cold bath. I had much difficulty in reaching the well,
where I drank four glasses of water, and returned with a fine
appetite to breakfast; again took walking exercise, and another
bath before dinner; and this has been the daily course, wearillg
the wet compress and dry bandage over the stomach. \rVhen
I left home, I had active gout in both elbows; this very shortly
disappeared. I have repeatedly tried, I believe I may safely
say, every reported remedy without much success, and felt
much doubt and hesitation in submitting to the treatment with
cold water. However, I have no reason to regret the trial,
feeling better and stronger than I have done for years. My ca-
pability of taking walking exercise has daily increased, and I
can now, withont much pain or fatigue, walk seven or eight
miles a day. From the repeate<l perspiration and ablutions,
the skin is softenPd and rendered more elastic, the swelling of
the legs has disappeared, and the lumps on the hands and fin-
gers materially reduced. In fine, by a continuance of the sys-
tem I am sanguine in being enabled to eradicate the enemy,
'lnd, as far as I can judge, without any the slightest risk in
')ringing on other complaints. I live moderately, and though
illowed by the doctor a glas:::) or two of sherry,* I have given
aven that up from choice, and really feel not the slightest desire
or any such stimulant. Although at home I have been much
in the habit of taking aperient medicine almost daily, I have

THOl\IAS CASE.
Dr. Cameron.
The lady who wrote the following letter was sent here with
her three sisters by Dr. Begbie, a physician of talent at Edin-
burgh ; but not to try the Water Cure.
DEAR SIR,
In compliance with your request, that I should give yo~ a
sketch of my case, I beg to say that I have been for many years
annoyed with a liability to take severe cold, with a cough that
continued for weeks, and sometimes months, more particularly
the last two years, when I was never more than a week with-
out it, and closely confined to the house from October till June,
never being able to go out without catching fresh cold, how-
ever warmly clothed, and even latterly in going through the
house if the weather was at all damp. The usual mode of treat-
ment was medicine, mustard poultices on the chest, leeches,
and rubbed with irritating liniments ; sometimes fly blisters,
and every cough mixture, and lo~enges,-all that could be
thought of was tried, warm drinks, &c., and generally several
days in bed at the commencement of every attack of cold. Oc-
casionally the cold affected the windpipe more than the chest,
which made the cough at those times incessant. A complete
change to bracing air, having been recommended, induced my
friends to bring me to )lalvem, but not to try the \Vater Cure;
but it had notthe desired effect, as I was attacked with a severe
cold, similar to what I usually felt, a.nd had I not consulted you,
must in all probability have been confined to the house for some
time, as going out always increased it. However, you advised
the lying in thewetsheet two orthreetimes a day,andrubbjJl.g
three times each day with the chilled wet sheet, wearing a
warm compress constantly on the chest, warm fomentations
applied to the stomach for two nights, drinking cold water, &c.,
&c., and walking out three or four times a da.y, which treat·
ment J followed, and at the end of three days, the feeling of cold
in the chest·was quite removed, and by the sixth day, the cough
completely gone, which indeed ~ppcared qnite l.ike a miracle,
and thoroughly convinces my fnends and myself of the extra-

THE WATEH i)URE. 91
'fBE PRINCESS SAPIEHA'S CHILDR.E~.
The following cases are of such interest thn.t I shall present
them to the reader with some details as published in my" \IVa~
ter Cure." The Princess is sc thankful for the preservation
of her children, and the benefit experienced l>y herself, tl1a.t she
repeats what is here written whenever she has an opportunity.
Her children were all born strumous and with Ycry large heads,
except the last, which was owing to her having gone through
the 'Vater Cure treatment some time before, and during the
whole time she was enciente. This child was born with a small
head, grew rapidly, has been in perfect health, and without any
of the peculiarities which characterized the six previous ones.
" vVhen at Graefenberg, I was introduced to the Princess
Sapieha at her request; all her family were under the treat•
ment, including herself and si::iter. This lady had lost four
children with affections of the brain anJ stomach, after having
consulted all the first men in Europe, and was without hope of
eventually saving two of the survivors, a girl and a boy. The
four who had died, had been carried off at difterent ages, from
two to seven years, by convulsions and vomiting, which nothing
would arrest. The most violent and energetic means were had
recourse to. The last, of the age of seven, vomited for four~
teen days before the fatal termination. Hearing from some of
her neighbors of the' miraculous cures' made by the Water
Cure, she determined to go and consult Priessnitz. The little
girl, six years old, had incessant cough, which had been gra~
dually increasing for three years; she expectorated large quan·
tities of thick yellow sputa, frequently mixed with blood; she
had hectic fever, and was reduced to skin and bone. This was
complicated with an affection of the brain~ and a tendency to
convulsions : her physicians declared the case to be one of con~
sumption~ and that the child could not last longer than six
months. Eighteen months before thi~ she had had an attack
of convulsions; blisters were applied, from the nape of the
neck to the loins, and the child was confined for above six
months lo her bed.. Priessnitz said there was still hopes, and
that it was 'scrofula fallen on the chest.' During the first six
months' treatment by the Water Cure, the child gained flesh
and appetite, the fever ceased, but the cough and spitting, mixed
with blood, were undiminished. The family physician, who
had accompanied them, was still against proceeding with the
THE PRACTICE OF
Water Cure, saying it was utterly useless. When the mother
asked what then he would propose, he said,' an issue in the
arm.' 'Oh !'she replied, 'thank you; you have applied that
once, and the child was laid up for several months, and narrowly
escaped with the erysipelas it brought on.' These contending
opinions, however, had such an effect upon her own health,
that she had frequent fainting fits. In this state of things, she
consulted me; on examining the child's chest, I found the whole
of the right side very dull on percussion. On placing the ear,
there was a strong bronchial rAle throughout; under the right
collar..bone, there was a small cavitv and the gargouillement
and pectorilque were distinct. I gave the following opinion at
once, in these words: 'You have no chance that I can see ex-
cept by the Water Cure, and I am happy to say that I agree
with Priessnitz in thinking there is a chance; the child is daily
gaining flesh, and the great point is to keep up the nutritive
powers, keep off fever, and relieve irritation in the chest as
much as possible.' I added, 'If it was my child, I should send
it from the low situation here in the town, up to the hilL' 1\fy
advice was taken.
" Her progress during the summer was very rapid ; she be-
came quite fat, with a ruddy complexion; but the conghinO'
and spitting, though considerably diminished, still continued,
and still mixed with blood. About a week or ten days after I
had first seen the cliild, I took Dr. Coq, an intelligent, and one
of the leading physicians of Ghent, (who was going though the
Cure, to see it; his opinion and advice were similar to my own.
"The Princess and her family were tmder my care during the
winter in Italy, her daughter going on regularly with the sys-
tem. Two months after my return home, I received a letter
from the Princess, which gave me great pleasure and confirmed
my prognosis. Relative to her daughter she says:-
"' Je profite de cette occasion pour vous dire que Sophie va
de mieux; elle tousse moins tousles jours, et ses nuits sont ex-
cellent. J'aime i'L Yohs dire, Monsieur, que vous etes pour

" I have since hearJ that the invalid has quite recovered.
·'The treatment has been as follows :-Every morning, at
T H .1:: W A T E lt C U 11 .1:: • 93
about six o'clock, she is placed sitting in a bath, containing
about nine inches of water, at a temperature of ::;ixty-five to
seventy degrees of Fahrenheit; in this :-:he is well rubbed with
the hands gently, all over, during a period of tlfteen or twenty
minutes; she b then dre~:sed, and goefl out to walk for an hour,
drinking several small tumblers of cold water during the ex-
ercise. The bath is repeated every night, an hour or two be-
fore bed-time, the same as in the morning. \Vhen taken out
of the bath, a double piece of linen steeped in cold water, and
well wrung out, is placed on the chest, covering the front part,
and reaching from the collar bones to the pit of the stomacll.
'fhis is completely protected from the air by a similar covering
of dry linen; it is worn night and day, and changed at noon for
a fresh one. \Yhen the cough was violent at night, and it
sometimes lasted for hours, I found the application of a fresh
wet compress always relieved it. I should not omit to mention
that soon after going to Priessnitz, she was atta.cked with a
violent convulsion, ending in a stiffened state of the whole body,
and complete insensibi1ity. \Vhen this occurred, Priessnitz
happened fortunately to be in the town; he pnt her at once into
a' shallow chilled bath,' where she was rnbbcd for three quar-
ters of an hour, before she showed any sigu::i of consciousness
or of life. During this period, she was taken out three times for
a few minutes, placed on a bed, and rubbed with wet band:;.
\Vhen this state i::; coming on, there is great dilatation of the
pupib, and it bas ~ince been preyented going any further by
' head baths,' which she ha::; taken every day :::ince this attack.
For the la:st fi\·e months tl1e head has been perfectly free, but
the head baths are still continued once a tlay a.t noon.
"I may rnc11tion, en passant, the state of her brother. He
has had a strong disposition to the complaint of which his bro-
thers and :5isters have died. It comes on the in following way:-
the face becomes 5ndclcnly deadly pale, the features shrinking,
the eye:; more or less fixed, the pupib dilated to their fullest ex-
tent: and vomiting begins. In from five to ten minutes, by the
cold hip bath, in which he remains twenty minutes= these symp-
toms are completely removed, and in half an hour he is ?at
playing as well as ever. In t.J:le first bad a~tack, before ~01ng
to Priessnitz, he was treated m the followmg way :- blisters
were placed on the stomach and all along the back-bone, and
the raw surface dressed with a preparation of opium, a~d
calomel and opium in large quantities given. i\ ~e.rnally. This
was a ~even months' business in bed and u. tns room. He

is now past bvdve years of ao·e, ami his teeth are all l.Olll-
pletely destroyed by the rnercurl When he wen.t to Gra{'fen-
berg, his eyes were so much afiected by the remedtcs, that there
were great fears he would become completely blind; for this
he went through the \Vater Cure, ami now :sees perfectly well.
H e has continued the treatment under my care in a gentle
manner, and though still a delicate-looking buy, is in perfect.
health. The diet in both these cases i:; cold milk, with bread,
morning and night, and a simple dinner of meat, vegetables,
and light pudding, and water alone as their beverage."
The state in which we found the patient sent by Mr. Coul-
son, reminded u::; forcibly of that of LORD BYRO~ in his last ill-
ness, as described in his life by ..Mr. 1\loore.-Lord Byron
called medicine "the dc:-5tructive art of healing." How truly it
proved to be :.;o in his own person, you will see, when I give you
the detatls of his la::-;t illness:-" Of all hi:; prejudices," :says
:.l\!r. .Moore, "he declared the strongest was that against bleed-
ing. His mother had obtained from him a. promise, never to
consent to being bled, and '"·hatever argument might be pro-
duced, his aver:::-ion, he said, was stronger than reason. 'lie-
sides, is it not,' he asked, ' asserted by Dr. Reid~ in his Etitia.ys,
that less slaughter is effected by the lance, than the lancet-
that minute instrument of mighty mischief!' On .Mr. 1\lillin-
gen observing that this remark related to the treatment of ner-
vous, but not of infhunmatory complaints, he rejoined, in an
angry tone, ' Who is nervous, if I am not ?-and Jo not those
other words of his apply to my case, where he says, that draw-
ing blood from a nervous patient, is like lool)ening the cords of
a musical instrument, whose tones already fail~ for want of a
sufficient tension ! Even before this illnes;;, you your:::elf
know how weak and irritable I had become; and bleedinrr, by
ir.creasing this state, will inevitably kill me. Do witl~ me
what else you like, but bleed me you shall not. I have had
sm·eral inflammatory fevers in my life, and at an aO'e..when
more robust and plethoric ; yet I got through themt\·dthout
bleeding. This time, also, will I talw my chauce.' After
much reasoning, and repeated entreatie::>, .Mr..l\Iillingcn at
length succeeded in obtaining from l1im a promise, that should
he feel his fever incr£'a~e at night, hP would allow Dr. Bruno to
THE WATER CURE. 95
bleed him. On revisiting the patient early next 11l0rning, Mr.
Millingen learned from him, that having pa::58cd, as he thought,
on the whole, a better night, he had not considered it necessary
to ask Dr. Bruno to bleed him. \Vh:1t followed, l shall, in jus-
tice to .Mr. Milling-en, give in his own words:-' I thought it
my duty now to put aside all consideration of his feelings, and ~
to declare solemnly to him how deeply I lamented to see him
triiie thus with his life, and show so little rc::,olution. His per-
tinacious refusal had already, I said, cau:;ed much precious
time to be lost; but few hour;::; of hope now remained, and, un-
less he submitted immediately to be bled, we could not answer
for the consequences. lt was true, he cared not for life, but
who could assure him, that unless he changed his resolution,
the uncontrolled disease might not operate :mch disorganization
in his system, as utterly and forever to deprive him of reason!
I had now hit at }a.;:,t on the sensible chord; and, partly annoy-
ed by our importunities, aud partly persuaded, he cast at us both
the .tiercest glance of vexation, and throwing out his arm, said,
in the angriest tone, ' There you are, I tice, a. d--d set of
butcherti-take away as much blood as you like, but ha,?e done
with it.' \Ve seized the moment, (adds l\lr. .Millingen,) and
drew about twenty ounces of blood. On cougnlating, the blood
presented a &h·ong bufiy coat ; yet the relief obtained did not
correspond to the hope;-; we had formed ; aud during the night,
the fever became stronrrer than it had been hitherto, the rest-
le::;:mess and agitation ~1creased, and the patient spoke several
times in an incoherent manner.'' Surely, this was sufficient
to convince the 1n0st school-bound of the worse than inopera-
tive nature of the measure. Far from it. On the following
morning, the 17th, the bleeding was repeated twice, and it was
thought right also to apply blisters on the soles of his feet !
\Yell might .Mr. Moore exclaim: "It is painful to dwell ou
tiuch details. ' For our present purpose, it will be sufficient to
state that although " the rheumatic symptoms had been com- "
plete.Jy removed,:: it was at the expen:;e of the patient's life; his
3ea h took place upon the 19th, (April,) .hat is, three days after
he was first bled.
Might 1 not venture an opinion, that a similar treatment
ttould have been attended by the same result in both cases ?
:Many months have now elapsed sil1Ce this patient left Malvern,
but a few days ago he wrote by a patient he sent he~e, to say
that by following hi:; instrnctions, he ,; still continued m perfect
health, and still called hirn~elf a' miracle.' ;·-This is his case·
96 THE I'ltAI.:Tit..£ Of
INDIGESTION, ETC., "\VITli THREATENING INFLAI\IMATION
OF THE BRAIN.
Tllis case was a very interesting one, and was sent here at
an hour's notice by Mr. Coulson, a distinguished surgeon in
London, under whose care he had previously been. 'fhe pa-
tient, a gentleman of forty years of age, had undergone exces-
sive mental excitement, accompanied with constant and dis-
trm'\si ug sinking about the stomach and bowels, fever a]ter-
nating with d.. tendency to fainti11g and cold sweats, all of which
he had endeavored to fight against by frequent taking of stimu-
lants. \Vith all this he had been unable to procure even a small
amount of sleep. In our first interview with him at .Malvern
his speech was almost incoherent, hi::; gestures violent, and his
whole appearance that of a perRon on the verge of insanity or
inflammation of the brain. His tongue was fiery red, his
bowels constipated, and his skin dry and harsh, except when the
cold sweat suddenIy appeared on it, together with the syrnp-
toms of fainting. All this plainly indicated the m;;c of the wet
sheet, in which be was to lay for an hour twice a day, ·with sitz
baths in the intervals. In twenty-fonr hours tlus patient be-
came calm, and slept almost all the time he wa::> in the wet
sheet, of which he spoke as the most soothing and delightful
remedy he had ever experienced. On the first night after com-
mencement of the treatment he slept five or six hours consecu-
tively. His bowels also opened and his tongue became paler;
of course no stimulants whatever were allowed, although up to
t.he moment of his treatment he had taken them largely, and he
expressed surprise at not feeling the want of them. At the end
of a week he pronounced his feelings to be better in all respects
than they had been for more than a year. Nevertheless we
thought it advisable he should continue the general treatment
_for a fortnight longer, which he accordingly did ; and at the
end of three weeks returned to London, speaking of himself as
"a miracle," and extolling the Water Cure in enthusiastic
terms.
REMARKs.-Nothing could be more striking than the imme-
mediately sedative effects of the wet sheet upon the highly ex-
cited nervous system of this pa.ticnt. It is impossible to con-
ceive of anymedicinal opiate acting so quickly and so efficiently;
neither had the sleep any of tlw disagreeable characterFJ of that
obtained by opiate, for he awoke soothed, refreshed, and with
a moist tongue. This effect too continued throughout the case;

he ... ~me rutS limbs would scarcely carry him half a mile, within
a w~A he was able to mount to the highest of these hills. The

preswJ hi:J snrprise at the totally altered view he took of the
circum!:'.tuuces which had previously so painfully excited him.

DANCL~'I ~, rru SCARLET .FEVER.
The following case wt\l engage the deepest attention. The
lady is the wife of a rne1dU.1\t at Hamburg. She was at Grae-
fenberg with her whol~ f.uaily durinrr the ten months I was
there. I give her case «s 1elated by D~. E. Jolmson.
iURS. KLAUKE'S CASE.
In the month of May, 184~ .l\1rc1. Klanlm, (aged about twen-
ty-seven:) was seized with p:ains in the head and back and
calves of the legs. Her face, ne.ck, arms, and legs, and sub-
sequently the whole body, became brightly scarlet, and she com-
plained of a soreness in the throat. The pulse was rapid, and
skin dry. She was packed in the leintuch for half-an-hour;
then rubbed all over in a tepid bath for twenty minutes with
the wet hand. She was now ordered to wear an umschlag
round her stomach night and day. 'Vhen she felt cold she was
rubbed down with the wet sheet-when hot, packed in the lein-
tuch ; and so on all through.
The tepid bath was suspended until by the application of a
succession of sheets the fever was reduced. Then the tepid
bath was repeated. Every morning she was packed up in a
blanket, in which she was allowed to perspire for an hour;
then she was put into the tepid bath. This tr~atment was con-
tinued for a fortnight. At the close of the sixtt day all fever
was extinguished, and at the close of the whole treatment her
strength was undiminished.
In addition to the aboYe, a Javement of cold water was ad-
ministered every ni~ht. During the whole time !'5he ate and
(,
98 1 1~::. 11: ..1. l lCt: nF
drank as ustml, and one evening- went tu a bull, (in thl' sa/()IJR
of Prlessnitz'::; csta.blbluncul,) uud t.Lwced fur hour.:.;, whilst her
whole body was crim:;on with scarb.tiu..t. On retnrning hmne
from the dance she wa.s rubbed down \Vith a wet ::;beet, went
to bed, and slept soundly.
What will the reader say to a lady dancing with srarll't fe-
ver? If she was not alarmed herself at such an apparent act
of temerity, surely out of the two or three lmntlreu percion~ who
were in the room wilh her, there were some who muot lJ l ve
been afraid of catching it. I think I may answer for tli.:m-
not one. Now I cannot ima.gine any human beiug, who has
seen the frequent and sometimes terrible results of scarlet fcv~r,
and who lJas heard of its fatality, so devoid of common human-
ity, as not to be curious to know the reason for this generJ.l u.b-
sence of fear in two or three hundred persons, with a pcttient
red with scarlet fever in the midst of them. The rea.::,on is
simply this: they aU kuew that there was uo danger attentling
scarlet fever when properly treated by the Water Cure system,
and the majority woultl have been glctd to have hatl it tiJere and
then, rather than run the risl{ of being c.tttacked by it wheu tltcy
could not obtain a judicious \Vater Cure treatment. They
knew and saw that putient~ could eat aml drink,-that in many
cases they eould go out a.nd walk, and as in the present in·
stance, dance-with scarlet fever.
These two or three hundred persons also observed the pa•
tients when the ~C<lrlet fever wa:::. gone, and they found that it
had left no mark behind it. Turn now from that picture, aud
look upon this.
Three weeks ago, a clergyman's wife at Worcester, who was
under my care, advised another clergyman's wife to send her
daughter, a fine, full-grown girl about fourteen years old, to
consult me. I found that she was perfectly deaf after scarlet
fever. The only communication with her was held by sign.s
and with the fingers. She was accompanied by her sister, a.
tine, handsome, he<.~.lthy-looking girl, some ynars older. Tln.:>
morning I was told ry the same clergyman':s wite that tlte
" eldest of th~::,e young ladies <tnd two of the younger children
were dead w1th scarlet fever, aud buried." I heard there was
something attempted with w:.tter in the::;e cases adJed to the or-

I do not ask my brethren that they should, from worldly pol·
icy, or even common humanity, study the \'Vater Cure; I ask it
from them for mercy's sake. When I first came t-o l\Ialvern. 1

offerEd the parish surgeon to treat as m<tny cases offever as he
pleased, to show him how the system was practised, and to tell
him all I knew aborrt it. Durin.g one winter I passed at Nice,
the scarlet fever was very fatal ; I was told by one of the lead-
ing practitioners, that he calculated there were from twelve to
fourteen deaths a day by jt. :My wite had it in its severest
form, and I declare that neither of us had a moment's appre-
hension. The Princess Sapeiha.'s nurse had it soon afterwards;
I treated her in the same way, and without any medicines. The
ulceration of the throat was severe in both cases; for this I
used, in addition, fomentations of warm water applied every
second hour, for an hour, with a yard of flannel well wrung
and renewed every ten minutes, a compress being worn in the
intervals ; no one can form any idea of the relief afforded by
this application without experiencing it.
SYl\IPTOl\IATIC FEVER.
This was one of Mrs. Klaukels children, whose treatment in
!lcarlet fever has just been related; I was present, and assisted
at the greater part of the treatment. I give the case as it was
related by the mother to Dr. John King and to Dr. Edward
Johnson some time afterwards.
" Alexander Klauke, aged three years, a fine lively child,
much predisposed to inihmmation, was attacked with fever, and
inflammation of the bowels, about a month previous to the
present disease. In the evening, the child was placed in a
bath not qwte cold, in which he remained twenty min ttes, ad-
ditional cold water being added, as the temperature rose by the
heat from his body.
"During this time cold water was poured with a tumbler-
glass on the head, repeated at intervals of a minute, and, as ie
usual, his whole body was rubbed cautiously by the maid. He
was then taken out of the bath, and placed on a sofa, covered
over with a dry sheet and blanket, with the back part of his
head in a head bath, for ten minutes ; by this time reaction had
taken place, when wet compresses were applied to the head and
back of the neck, and the body, from the arm pits to the hips,
was wrapped in a similar way. He slept quietly till three
o'clock in the morning, when the same process was repeated,
thP previous symptoms having returned.
100 T 11 E P n A c 1' t G £ U F
"The chiM wa~ nCT:tin pla.ced in bed, where he slept till the
morning, and was th~n ronnel to be qtlitc well, and went out
as usual.
"A month afterthis attacl\ he \\·as taken ill, in a similar way,
but with symptoms much more SRYere.
"'l'he fever runninrr high, am: accompanied with delirium,
the treatment was con~met1ced by placing him successively in
nine wet sheet5, frnm which the water was J.mt :5lightly wrung
out. In each of thc~e he remained about live minutes. To-
wards the last, the heat being dimini:'hecl, he was allowed to
remain ten minute~. A thick wet compres:-; was applied to the
head and breast in additiou-these being the parts where the
heat was greatest. 'l'hc feet were cold, and as long as they
remained so, the wet sheet was only applietl clown to the knees;
meantime, the feet and legs were rubbed ~trnngly with the
bauds. \Vhile the extreme heat continued. the wet sheet was
covered by a thick dry one: instc-ad of a. blanli:et, as is usual.
After the last wet sheet, he was placerl at once in a bath of
(seventeen degrees of Ren.nmnr) where he remained an llOur-
the same process of rubbing and pouring water over the head
being practised.
"The first da.y the Rame proce~s was repeated four time~,
the duration of the bath being not .so long, as when the fever
was not as high.
"During the night the wet cloth was changed every half
hour; on the morning of the seconcl d:ty, the child refused to
go into the water, calling himself at inlerrals for additional
wet sheets. Orclers were given that the inclination of the child
should be obeyed.
"In the course of the morning the child himself desired that
he might be pnt into the bath, where he remained until the
heat in the armpits and on the back of the neck was the same
as the rest of the body, this being the general guide for the
duration of a oath; and it is \Vorthy of remark that the more
the fever wa~ reducecl the more tranquil the patient became,
till at last he remained with perfect tranquillity in the bath.
The same treatment, slightly varied, was continued for four
days, when the child was well, and was sent out to play with
the other children." .
A r.hild in fever, when under the Water Cure treatment will
often direct what should be done; I have often heard ther~ ask
for a fresh sheet, a!' in the P.resent instance, when it \\'llS pro-
posed that they should go mto the bath. Their in ·tincti\·~

feeling is generally right and should often be obeyed. When
they are sufficiently refre~ed by the gradual cooling of the
wrung sheet, they will themselves ask to be put into the bath,
rather than lay any longer in the sheet, or have it changed for
a fresh one.
CASE OF S~IALL POX.
A young man aged twenty-one, on his way to Graefenberg
for the treatment of a rheumatic complaint, found himself un-
well at Vienna, but travelled on, and when he reached his
destination, was in high fever \'lith delirium. Until this was
reduced, an abreibung was kept applied in the quickest suc-
cession: so immediately hot did the wet linen become. The
delirium quickly subsided. When the fever was much abate(l
he was put into the leintuch, and this was followed by ..ne
shallow bath. Very soon a copious small-pox eruption appear-
ed. Leintuchs were continued, according to the state of the
skin. There was no return of fever ; the appetite was natural.
ln ten days, he was able to walk out of doors. He had been
vaccinated in his infancy; but, not\vithstanding, the pustules
were universal and of full size. No pitting ensued. (This
case is 1elated by Sir Charles Scudamore.)
APPETITE AND SLEEP RESTORED•
•
An Austrian officer, aged sixty, had been very stout aud
rema1kable for the goodness of his appetite; but by degrees he
became dyspeptic, very nervous, and above all, lost his sleep
more and more by degrees, till at length he was not able to
procure more than one hour of dosing in the twenty-four, for
upwards of two years. He had no regular sleep whatever;
opiates would not succeed, and he was in a most wretched
state when he went to Graefenberg. Three months passed
away without any decided improvement. It was in the begin-
ning of spring; the weather very cold, and he was not strong
enough to take much exercise. Hence a slower improvement.
Treatment : in the first of the morning a leintuch, followed by
a shallow tepid bath; an abreibung twice a day; usually a
102 THE PRACTICE OJ:'
second leintuch, followed either by an abreibnng or Rhallow
bath. By degrees he imprcved, gained some appetite, and
sleep returned, at first for an _Jour only; then more .and mole,
till, by the middle of summer, he could sleep comlortably for
seven hours; ana he quitted Graefenberg recovered frolT' every
inconvenience.
HYPOCHONDRIASIS, PSORIASIS, AND SCIATICA.
The gentleman, (an Englishman) about sixty years of age,
who was the subject of these three severe afflictions, belonged
formerly to the civil servke in India. I made his acquaint-
ance at Graefenberg immediately on my arrival, and am in-
debted to him for introductions to sevenl valuable cases besides
his own. He had labored under these affections for eight years.
Shortly after he had become the subject of sciatica and psoria-
sis, (which latter disease his French medical advisers denomi-
nated dartre farineuse) his mind became excessively excited
by some family occurrences, with the particulars of which he
did not, of course, think it necessa:ry to acquaint me. In a
short time, what with this excitement, the torture arising from
his sciatica, (in1lammation of the sheath of the great sciatic
nerve where it passes through the structure of the hip,) and
the intolerable itching produced by the skin disease, the equi-
librium of his mind became so much disturbed that he was not
considered in a fit condition to be left by himself. Always in
a state of high excitement, there were times when he was per-
fectly insane.
For eight years the sufferings nf this poor gentleman, bodily
and mental, were indeed awful. When I asked him• to give
me a detailed account of his sufferings, he sat thoughtful for a
moment, and then, going to a table, he took up a small pocket-
book, and opening it at a particular page, and placing his fore-
finger between the leaves, he re-seated himself. "Some time
ago," said he, "I was perusing the book of Deuteronomy; and
in the course of my reading, the passages which I have copied
into this pocket-book rivetted my attention. They were so ex-
actly characteristic of my sufferin~s, that I almost fancied
myself the particnlar object of the divine wrath, a11d that I was
even then realizing the fearful denunciations which those pasa
sages of Scripture contained. No language of mine can so
truthfully or so forcibly convey to you the horrors under \Vhich
I was :aboring both in body and mind. Read them," continued
'IHJ:: WATER L:URE. 103
he, "and judge whether I have not great reason to be thankful
that I am now such as you see me.'' He handed me the book
ami I read as follows: "'I'he Lord will smite thee with the
botch of Egypt and with the emerods! and with the scab, and
with the itch, whereof thon canst not be healed. 'fhe Lord
shall smite me with madness, and blindness, and astonishment
of heart. The Lord shall smite thee in the knees, and in the
legs, with a sore botch tb it cannot be healed; from the sole of
th~ foot to the top of thy head : and thy life shall hang in doubt
before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have
none assurancP of thy life. In the morning thou shalt say,
'Would God it were even;' and at even thou shalt say,' Would
God it were morning!'"
"At the time," contiuued he when I had done reading," that
I was perm~ing- tlwse passages, those terrible denunciations
were most of them actually realized in my person. I trembled
as I read- for at that moment I was covered ' from the sole of
my foot to the top of my head' with an intolerable itching
botch. I was even then ' smitten in the knees and in the legs
\Vith a sore botch, and was covered with !='cabs. 1\ladness and

also mine. I harl indeed 'no assurance of mv life,' for I was
often sorely tempted to destmy it; and e\·cry 1;1orning I \vished

This gentlem:m had then been under the \Yater Cure about
three month::;. His ~ciatica had entirely left him- the erup-

the state of his· ~ind was perfectly calm, cheerful, rational,

SYPHILIS.
The subject of this case, a Bohemian gentleman, resident in
Vienna, appeared to have been affected with two distinct disea-
ses-piles and syphilis of six years' standing. He had been
under the care of the most skilful medical men, who salivated
him to such an extent, and so reduced him by their medicines,
that be could not walk iifty yards without the greate::;t exertion
and fatigue. In this state he arrived at Graefenberg~ encased
in flannel and thick wrappers, in order to prevent his catching
cold, under the advice of his physicians. He was suffering
with great thirst, nausea, fever, continued pain at the back of
the head, pains in the limbs, ernptions, costiveness, and exces-
sive debility.
Under the Water treatment he improved daily, and to such
an extent, that in two months he could walk six miles with
comparative ease; and in December last, in severe frosty
weather, he walked about with one coat on, namely, a pilot 0f
light texture. flis flannels, wrappers, and superfluous cloth-
ing had been discarded soon after reaching Gra.efenbera. At
the period of my departure he had been four months atGrae-
fenbcrg. The piles yielded to a regular action of the bowels,
although he had been troubled with them for some years.
It is a remarkable fact that after the wet sheet baths, which
formed part of the treatment of this case, the water wrung
from the sheets always had a milky consistency and fetid
smell. (Related by John Smethm·st, 'f. D.)
THE WArEn. CURE. 105
REMARKs.-The period is not far distant when the \Vater
Cure treatment will supersede every other mode at preser...
pra(~tised for this disease. The cure is radical, effected w~th
great facility, and not followed by secondary symptoms. Ev-
ery medical practitioner who has seen much of the secondary
effects of mercury will hail the new treatment as a great boon.
Once fairly tried in our great hospitals! the Water Cure treat-
ment will become general. I had the opportunity of seeing the
results of the treatment in a great number of cases, presenting
every form of syphilis and venereal t!isease. There was a very
bad case here when Drs. I'ewsbury and Crawford were in my
house; the recovery was complete in three weeks. Eight
months have now elapsed, and the patient has remained per-
fectly well. Did space permit, I could relate a great number
of similar cases, attended with the same happy resuit.- J. W.
GOUT IN AGED PATIENTS.
AN Austrian field marshal, eighty-two years of age, had been
a gouty martyr through a long life, and visited Graefenberg four
years ago, when in such a state of infirmity that he could
scarcely- put his feet to the ground. l\Iild treatment was used,
but it proved sufficient to produce ~1ils which formed near the
affected joints. He gradually improYed, and finally threw away
his stick, walking and riding on horseback with almost the
activity of former years.
An old Polish general, nearly eighty years of age, also
received nearly equal benefit from the treatment of his gouty
sufferings and infirmity. (Related by Sir Charles Scudamore.)
The Prussian field marshall Titchell, at the age of eighty·
four years, was going through all the processes of the Water
Cure for his general health, and for gout, at the time I was
1mder the same treatment. His constitution was much im-
proved, and his gouty sufferings relieved. I have introduced
these cases to show that the W::ter Cure cannot be so " des-
perately dangerous,'' when individuals at this advanced period
of life can go through it with benefit. The next case of rheu-
matism is nlso an illustration.-]. W.
·o6 THE PRACTICE OP'
RHEUl\lATISi\1 TREATED AT THR AGE OF SEVENTY.
A gentleman residing at Lea~1ington, pnt hiu1self under !!11
~re ia8t ~ummer. lie had sufiered a great many years w1th
•heumatistn, and had been treated by n.U the most noted prac-
titioners with little or no benefit. During the last twenty years
ne had been forbidden to touch cold water. I found him in the
!allowing state : the hands, knees, and feet di:5torted and en-
larged; the patella of each knee firmly fixed and immoveable;
all the Jocomotiou he was capable of, was a few yards on
crutches. For the seven preceding winters he had not ven-
tured out of his honse, and ht: was carried up and down ~tairs.
A few weeks after he had commenced the treatment by water,
he wa~ able to walk a considerable distance with one crutch,
and shortly afterwards a stick \vas 1ound a sufficieut support,
and he went out in all weathers wiU10ut any disagreeable result.
He left .
1\Ia.lvcrn in the antumn and ha."i returned here to spend
pru.t of the summer. He has told me that during the winter
he had taken a cold bath nearly every morning, ami walked out
every day. ~1any medical men were very angry with him, and
a report was raised that he had fa1len down in a fit coming out
of church, c. the nece::)sary ana inevitable result of his tnorning
ablutions!'' His door was crowded with carriages to inquire
his fate; so that he was obliged to go and walk about the town
to quiet the tumult. In the midst all thi::;, a. little liberality is
so very rcfrc~hing, that I cannt.~t resi:;t recording, that Dr. Jeph-
son~ meeting this gcntlemau walking about the ~trects of
Leamington, ::;aid to him, " \Vell, I do not care how you got so
well, or who made you so, I cong-ratulate you on your great
improvement." lie has not taken a grain or a drop of medi..
cine for the last ten months.

I can declare that since the 21st of September, 1842, I have
never for a. sing1e day had occasion to as:;is. in any way what-
ever, ~tuLborn bowel::; which reluctantly yielded for years and
years, only to the most powerful and pernicious drugs.
It i::) true that to Llomcepathy I owe much. from having first
taught me to abandon druggery; but then Homrepathy had
nothing to otler (me at leat>t) in ortler to affect that which the

nnder your prudent and judicious management, so admirably
eftected. Still I am often in great pain-and no wonder ;-a
desperate malady that for six or eight and twenty years had
been in full posses::;ion of me, and which has probably been
immensely aggravated by the swallowing of a mas:; of the most
violent and poi::;onous drugs-a qua11tity. which I do believe if
noted down would not be credited. It is no ,,·onder: I say, that
even water cannot in thirteen mouths effect a cure. But it has
kept me in excellent, and even rolm:-ot general health, and if,
in:3tead of being seventy-five I was only nfty-fi,·e, I should not
be witlwut hope of your totally ~ubdning the enemy; but as I
shall probably ltardly give you time to obt:i in a complete vic-

and re:::-ignation that I can muster. lf I do outlive it, (which,

system. So persevere. my good doctor: a~ you have hitherto
done, and believe me you will find a confiding patient; and
may you and the admirable system you have introduced into
this country with so much talent, perseverance, and success,
go on and prosper through good report and ba.d report.
You will bo gla.d to hear that Lady Allelaide is in high

STOMACH AND LIVER DISEASE, WTTH ASTHMA.
1\l.ALVERN, 9th OcTOBER, 1843.
MY DEAR SIR,
It affords me the greatest pleasure before leaving l\falvern to
add my evidence in favor of the admirable system you practise,
and my thanks for the kindness and attention with which you
treated my case.
I have been upwards of eleven years in India; in the year
1836 I returned home on leave of absence, and had a most
severe attack of jnfluenza, and have not been well since. T
returned again to England in May last. I had stomach
asthma, and spasms of the stomach in their severest forms,
with indigestion and constipation of bowels, and torpid liver of
many years standing. I was treated with bleeding, leeches,
blisters, and medicines, bn: all my symptoms returned again
with the same severity. I ~hen tried the mineral waters with
no benefit, suffering two severe attacks while taking them ; in
this most miserable state I determined to place myself under
your care. I am in every way more than satisfied with the
result. After from three weeks to a month's treatment, I met
by accident your neighbor, my friend, the Rev. Mr.--, who
did not recognise me with my altered appearance. When I
came to you in August I was clothed in fla1mel, and wore a.
great coat, and was still chilly and cold; now in October I am
without flannel, wear a single light coat, and am warm and
comfortable. •
I had what is called a crisio3, and a severe one; the phenom·
ena attending it would not be believed by many without wit·
nessing them, but I felt. perfectly well at the time, ate heartily
with an appetite tinea times a day, and took plenty of exercise
with alacrity. A friend of mine, Captain , whose case
is well known to all in your establishment, had a crisis at the
same time; it was considered me of the most formidable that
occurs, yet I observed his gaiety was not diminished, and his
general proceedings as little disturbed- as my own.
So great ltas been the benefit I have received, n.nd"SQ con-
vincing are the many proofs I have witnessed of the extraordi-
nary benefits to be derived from the Water CUie treatment
fairly carried out, that it is my anxious wish to see others
under similar suffering avail themselves of so certam and safe
~ cure. Wishing you many years of health to continue yom
T ll £ W A. T 1-; It C ti I~ E . 109
present employment so eminently for the service of others, I
have great satisfaction in subscribing myself,
My dear Sir,
Yours very faithfully,

Captain 44th Regiment.

TUBERCULAR CONSUl'llPTION.
We do not, as some of our kind neighbors would have it
supposed, profess to" cure consumption,'' cancer, or incurable
diseases, but we do profess and believe, that we could in the
majority of cases prevent their occurrence by a judicious Water
Cure treatment. \Ve morPover go further and assert, that in
some cases great ameliomtion may be effected by the same
means, even when these states are in existPnce. The follow-
ing is an illustration. It may be said that it is au anomalous
or solitary instance, still it serves my purpose, which is to show
the extraordinary restorative and preservath·e powers and prop-
erties of ·water.
The yotmg lady, the subject of the following case, is about
twenty-six years old; from the age of seven years she has been
in delicate health, with all the characteristics of a scrofulous
constitution. H er mother died of tubercular consumption, and
she has a sister whose death is daily expected from the same
disease. It is above four years ~ince her own lungs gave
evidence of becoming diseased, being troubled with a constant
cough, and two years later the expectorated matter was streaked
with blood. Last winter she was laid up, and lo;:;t all her
strength ; hectic fever, a.nd night perspirations also set in with
considerable severity. At this time she met with my work on
the \!Vater Cure, and was much struck with the case of the
Princess Sapieha's daughter. I may mention that she is a
young lady of great courage, intelligence and ori ~inality of
mind; and commenced the treatment herself, without consult-
ing any one. She soon found herself relieved from the fever
and night perspiration, her appetite returned, and she was able
to take exercise. For several months she went on with an
active system of treatment, waU{ing from six to eight miles a
day; her appetite increasing, and feeling in short, in excellent
health, but the cough and expectoration continued. At this
time her feet began to swell, look red nnd felt !'Ore; she wrotM

to some one profes:-:ing the water treatment, \Vho told her to
<.le:--i~t from it immcdiatclv. f-ihc did so, the ft•Pt rccm·cred, and
she was again scrilm..;Jy 111. ln the f:pring ~he came lteru. On

size in the summit; the pectorilquc and other ~igu:-; u( a cavity,
were not to be mistaken. The right lung. with tiJc cxc(·ption
of from three to four iucltcs ofthe upper pari, which a}:"n g<nc
evidence of bcinCY affected, was as far a~ conld be n~certaincJ,
0
sound. A few morning~ after thi8, I rcqu<'~tt•d Dr. Gully to
make an investigation ; he concurred with me exactly in opin-
ion. The patient was put under a regular cuur~£' of treatment,
and soon got into perfect health, in which she remains at this
m0ment. The solidity is evidently much le~s than it \\'as fo11r
months back. Some weeks ago she was examined by Dr.
College of Cheltenham, and Dr. Savage of London. Their
obscn·ation was: "that she ought to be dying.:' l\ly 0pinion
is, that reparation will take place, and Dr. Gully coincides with
me. \Vhen she lea\·es off the treatment she become;; ill, and
well again when it is resumed. There is nothing to prevent
her going on with it, until the desired result is obtained.
The following satisfactory recovery took place l11_q1 winter
fhe Rev. J\Ir. ll!a.jendie wal" in my house at the time; he and
the patient got into such condition, that they used to walk tG
\Vorcester (eight miles distant) to church ; this thP.y did frorr
mere redundancy of health.
NERVOUS INDIGESTION, ETC., '\YITH SUICIDAL PROPENSITY.
The subject of this distres:-;ing malady was a gentleman of
forty-six years of age, \\'ho after eighteen years of acti\·e anrl
inces:;ant attention to commercial affair:::, retired with a mod-
erate fortune from them in con::;equence of tlH~ growing distre~s
both in the stomach and brain, 'vhich unfitted l!im from further
action, and, ns he said: "rendered the si6ht of the ledger intol-
erable." It avails not to repent all the means he 1~:ld tried pre-
vicus to his trial of the \Vater Cure; suffice it tha.t they
comprised all the circ!c of drug m·3dication, and, what is for
the most part as bad, drug dielelic'l, by which is meant the
system c.· keeping up a cert.-:in ammnt of stimulation frorv
1 Jl E \'; A T E R t' li R r. , 111
food anti \\ iue on the condition or maintaining a proportionate
amount ofstimulation from medicine~. I !c came here complain-
ing that he only got one hour or an ltour and a half ~lcep in
twenty-four hours, that he had the most horriule mental ~ensa­
tion~, the predominant one ucing that he w.ts doomed to be his
own destroyer : indeed for the last two yt•ars he had never been
left without some one to watch him. His bov.·els always cos-
th·e, and his belly protuberant, no pain was present when they
were pressed; but eating always brought on a more intense
dPgree of the mental pain. His volition was quite gone, and
his moral courage extinguished. The contents of the chest
were perfectly so1md.
\Ve commenced the treatment of this ca~e with hot fomen-
tations to the stomach and bowels at lx>d time, the wet !'beet
bath in the morning and evening, a sitz bath in the middle of
the day, and he also commenced lying in the wet sheet; the
result of which wa:-:. that on the fourth night he han th·e hours'
sleep. From the bowels too he had on the morning following
this a good natural evacuation. The mind, however, still held
by its painful sensations. He now began to lay eYery morn-
ing from one hour to one hour and a half in the wet sheet,
followed by a bath ; the sitz bath at noon anti the wet sheet
bath being continued. During thi~ time he went e\·ery morn-
~ng walking on the hill, and drank from three to six tumblers
of water as he felt inclined. ln the course of the day he drank
from eight to twelve tumblers, taking exercise which varied
from fh·e to ten miles a day. At the end of elC\·en weeks he
left Malrern perfectly recovered, having, tluring the latter half
of that period. u:-;eu the douche daily, and broken upon the wet
sheet by occa:--ional :-;weatings in the blankets. IIis capauility
of taking vratcr increased with his progress towards health,
and he sometimes took fifteen or twenty tumblers a day. The
changes in thP expre~sion of his face, indicative of that iJI his
teeliwrs, was :::>trikinO' to aU the patients in the e~tablislunent,
0 :::-
and from beinrr the most lttO'nbrious he becnme the most laugh-
ter-lo\'ing of them all. H~ glept invariably from the time he
went to bed-ten o'clock- until the servant awoke him in the
morning; and ltis sleep was dreamless.
The onhr evident ctisis in this ca~e was an increased action
of the bO\V'el::; for a fortnight, carried to the degree of diarrhrea.
for two or thren dav:;. but without any pain: griping or debility.
T he wet sheet, ho\;evcr, iu which he laid for a loug time, ren-
dered the water in which he \.vas daily washed, dark ~nd
turoid. with a copions flocculent sediment.
112 THE PRACTICE OF
REMARKs.-Here is a case in which during two years the
patient had been gradually getting wor::;c, notwithsta.ndiug that
he had obeyed, as he said: to the letter evc~·y ~ystem of trcatmct;lt
he had followed, bttcked by perfect rest of mmd ami body. It 1s
plain that in such fearful states of irritation of the n0.rvcs of
diP"estion and of the bmin, all interual medicinal means .should
rather exasperate than alleviate, and such was the fact in the
present instancP, Yet by the soothing operation of the loca.l
fumentations and the general application of the wet sheet, an
almost immediate effect was produced upon that irritation, as
the sleep and rapidly increasing quietude of mind testified.
The same remedies, by thus reducing irritation, and conJoined
with the derivative effect of the sitz bath, succeede(l at an
early stage in setting up a regular movement of the bowels.
Having thus secured the quiescence of the nervous system and
restored the regularity and quality of the secretions and excre-
tions, it only remained to renovate the tone of the system,
which was effected most completeIy by the douche, and the
appropriate union of the previously named remedies. It will
be remarked that the diarrhcea here served as an internal crisis,
of which mention has been made in the previoLlS pages. But
although this did not continue for more than four days, there
was for as many weeks from two to three copious natural
evacuations every day; and it was a curious feature, as
observed by the patient himself, that the less he ate the more
copious was the evacuation, a fact of which he convinced him·
self by l'epeated experiment.
THE CASE OF A PHYSICIAN WITH CHRONIC RHEUMATISM
AND GOUT, AND TENDENCY TO l\IALIGNANT DISEASE OF
THE STOMACH.
A talented physician, enjoying considerable practice in one
of the suburbs of London, was the ~ubject of this case. He
is forty-five years old, during fifteen of which he has been
afflicted with rheumatism and gout; beRides which he has an
hereditary tendency to black cancer of the stomach, his mother
having died of that frightful malady. He had been constantly
under treatment of one kind or the other, until his case was
nearly hopeless, and his health so broken up as to oblio-e him
to tliink seriously of abandoning his practice. Au oll friend
THE WAT:iR CUI!£.
of his, a physician* at the time tmder treatment o: the Water
Cure at Malvern, wrote to him, advising him struiUously to
try it, which he determined to do; bnt previously made a point
of calling on two of the must eminent practitioners in London,
who, as might be expected, ridiculed the idea, recommending
at the same time a course of mercury and iodine. The patient
having previously tried this with some disastrous results, and
convinced, as he said, " that that was all that was wanting to
finish him off,., at once started for :\lalvern, where he arrived
in the following condition. The body mnch emaciated; the
trunk almost bent double; face pale, sallow, and anxious;
cheeks sunken; tongue swollen to twice its natural size, furred
and red at the edges ; appetite morbid and capricious, leaning
to indigestible articles of food; bowels torpid, with bad secre-
tions ; knees swollen and painful,--one of them lame for sev-
eral years past; lumbago; incapability of walking more than
two o:r three hundred yards without great pain and exhaustion ;
considerable fulness and excitement about the head; little or
no sleep, and what there was, of an unrefreshing kind.
We shall not enter into the details of the treatment of this
case, but will merely mention that by careful management he
was soon brought into a state that allowed of the application
of all the processes of the Water Cure, even to the douche ;
and that, although there wer~ many other drawbacks in the
shape of mental excitements on family aftairs, he left :Malvern
at the end of eleven weeks, standing erect, walking ten and
twelve miles a day on the hills \Vithout fatignel the lameness
having disappeared together with the chronic swelling of the
knees; his appetite so great as to require restraint, his sleep
restored, and the bowels in perfect order. He left this about
a month ago, highly satisfied with the results, and only regret-
tinO' that his professional avccations obliged him to return to
to\;n, otherwise he woltld have preferred to continue the treat-
ment tbrouuhout the summer. \Ve venture to say that the
change in his complexion and expression of countenance will
be no small matter of aston7;hment to his metropolitan friends,
both professional and laical.
REMARKS.-It will be seen that even a medical man may go
through the "Dangers of the Water Cure," and come out of
them, not only unscathed, but. restored. Yet it should be stated

that this cnlicrhtcned ~·rntleman would have been deterred JioH1
0 '•
trying this only really safe treatment, bnt lor the prcs:;in~~ re4
presentations of Dr. Crawford, who, from investigation uHl
experience in his O\Yn person here, was well able to allay any
apprehensions on the subject. We look forward with confi4
dence to the day when many medical men will make a simila1
trial with a sinula.r event.
SCROFULA.
I extract the following from my work on the Water Cure ;
when Captain ..Jlaridge came to Graefenberg, to confirm his
growing convic•.ions, I particularly pointed out the following
case to him.
"As in many other diseases, medicinal treatment has been
found very ineffectual. Iodine has been found to do more harm
than good, and is a dangerous remedy; the great reliance has
been placed on change of air, diet, and bathing. From what I
have seen of the' \V::tter Cure,' it has been very successfLtl in
the treatment of scrofula. The elevated position in which
these establishments are formed, tlte pure air constantly in-
haled, regular exercise, the tonic effect of a scientific system
of bathing, the increased powers of digestion, forming new and
healthy nutritive matter in large quantities, do wonders. But
independently of all these powerful hygienic means, pure water,
applied externally, has an effect purely its own, which cannot
in the present state of our knowledge, be fully explained; nor
is it absolutely necessary. We crtn study the effects of gravi-
tation, without knowing what gravitation is. W c can observe
the varied phenomena. of sensibility, and the different sympa-
thies of the human bodies, without ever knm\:ing what they are.
"The treatment of scrofula by water embraces the whole of
what is yet known of the modes of its application; no two
cases can be treated a.likl?. 'rho age aud relativc Rtrength of
the paticntc;, the complication:-:, ami the extent of the ravages
which the di:--easc ha:. can:--cd, are the only guide::-; evt't-vthincr

and his ~:nowledge of the disease ami the remedy. 'There were
a number of children under treatment at Gracfenberg when J
was there, and one-grown up person-a young lady from Ham·

burgh. She left before me, perfectly cured ; she was v&-y
handsome when the tumefaction of the nose, lips, &c., had
disappeared ; she had been about twelve months uuder treat·
ment, and commenced it with all the external characteristics
of scrofula, which she had had from an early age ; her general
health was also much impaired, attended with considerable
suffering. For the first few months there was no evident change,
except in the general feeling of health, which appeared to have
become perfect. At this time the feet amllegs began to swell,
soon succeeded by copious discharges of thick glutinous flnid
from the feet; this continued for three months, when it ceased,
leaving her in the state I have described, without mark or
external swelling. During the time that this crisis went on in
the extremities, the warm compresses· were kept continually
applied, wearing large over-all boots, and taking her daily
exercise with her accustomed facility. The general treatment
consisted in the sweating process, wet sheet, cold, tepid, and
chilled baths, l1ip bath, foot bath, compresses and douche, and
the drinking of spring water, in proper quantity. In spinal
complaints proceeding more or less from this cause, the Water
Cure is equally efficacious. There were several cases I noted
with great interest which made very rapid progress."
LIVER AND STOl\iACH COl\IPLAINT, WITH EMACIATION.
The following was a good case ; I cannot mention the gen·
tleman's name, but he was attended at the same time by my
colleague, Dr. Gully: I may mention that Sir Joseph Copley
dined in my house nearly every day during the progress of
the treatment.
Mr. , a Liverpool merchant, in consequence of long
continued exertion in the climates of South America, irregular
livino-, and conl:iiderable labor of brain, had at length ~allen into
a state of disease indicated by the following symptoms.
Complexion pale yellow, without a sign of circulating blood;
face thin and haggard; body generally emaciated ; pain in the
right side of many years standing, bowels confined, appetite
gone ; great lassitude and indisposit~on to exertion. Fo~ t_hese
ailments he had gone through vanous courses of medlCmes,
mercurials, purgatives, tonics, &c.; he had also tried different
116 THE l'R.ACTICE Of
mineral waters and had finished the list with a ·oHr::;c of Mor-
rison's Pills; all to no purpose, for he came to us wit.h enlarged
liver, and all the t;ymptoms of confirmed stomach {hseas_e. It
should not be omitted that he suffered from freqnent t1c and
cramps in the leg. His age was forty-six years.
Alternate wet sheets and sweatings, with frequent sitz-baths.
compress constantly kept to the abdomen, and latterly the
douche, produced, in the course of a few weeks, a decided
change in his appearance. His appetite became enormous, his
digestion undisturbed, and the evacuations from the bowe1s,
twice a day, Yery copious; he slept well, and his spirits were
of the highest order. At the end of a month a crisis of boils
commenced, principally over the region of the liver and rig'Rt
side of the body, which, however, were rather a subject of jest
than of alarm to him, since, notwithstanding there were as many
as twenty or thirty at one time upon him, he was never once
absent from the breakfa::;t, dinner, and supper table, and took
his walks as he had always done. The only difference in
treatment required for these boils was an extra wet sheet in
the middle of the day, which, with the refreshing of the linen
compresses, he found removed all inconvenience and disagree-
able sensation, which might have arisen from the existence of
the boils. Under the action of these boils, the enlargement of
the liver rapidly gave way, and the diminution of its disease
was palpably exhibited in his face, which became round and
red from being pale and thin.
REMARKs.-Jn every way this case is satisfactory, and the
result was obtained in much shorter time than we expected,
being a little above six weeks. It is further satisfactory, as it
gives the opportunity of demonstrating what has been asserted
in the former pages of this work relative to the perfect safety
of the crisis of ~oils when these arc produced with discretion,
and treated with judgment. Being withdrawn from busi-
ness and free from all artJficial stimulants, both mental and
bodily, we perceive how ~mall an affair this crisis is. But had
t~is patient left us a fortJhght before he did, with the boils upon
h1m, and entered upon the cares of his business at Liverpool,
or had he put himself under a course of drug medication at
that time, we venture to say that the result would have been
very different. As it is, we hear at this time (now five months
since his leaving Malvern) that he is on the point of embarking
for Canada, and says," that he has got a new lease of life from
the Water Cure.''
THE WAT£R c·. RE. 117
1\'tiSCARRIAGE.
In relating the f.)1lowing case I must confine myself to the
leading facts, as I cannot enter into the details for the non-
professional reader. The lady, the wife of a celebrated sculptor,
was induced to try the Water Cnre treatment, by her friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Calvert, who had been several months in my
house. She was suffering from the effects of six successive
miscarriages. Some of the symptoms were of a serious na-
ture, and the recumbent posture was found necessary-any
movement being accomplished with difficulty, and followed by
great exhaustion. Having practis~d many years as an ac-
coucheur, and been present at thf confinement of nearly a.
thousand ladies, it may be allowed that I have had sufficient
experience to form a just opinion in such matters. The
treatment at first was gentle, and carefully graduated: it con-
sisted of the tepid wet sheet bath, chilled sitz-baths, and a com-
press on the abdomen. In a few days the warm wet sheet
packing, and chilled shallow bath, with sitz-baths reduced in
temperature, and of longer duration. In the second \veek she
could walk about, and used all the baths at the natural temper-
ature, and packing twice a day in the wet sheet. The third
week she was able to use the douche, and could ascend the
hills and take prolonged and active exercise. The rapid resto-
ration to health and strength in this case, after so long a period
of debility, and lying on couches, &c., was considered extraor-
dinary, and a subject of much congratulation by her friemJs, and
many patients in the house, who had witn0ssed her previous
state of eA.ireme debility.
Numbers now go to the Water Cure for this distressing dis-
position alone--for it has been found most successfu1 not only
in restoring the patient from the immediate effects, but also
in preventing a recurrence. During my long sojourn on the
continent, I met with numerous instances both in society and
at the different Water Cure establishments I visited. This
desired change is the result of the patients learning a more
efficient and strengthening mode of managing themselves-sub-
stituting the stimulus of fresh air, and water properly adminis-
tered, for the stimulants and sedatives and the destructi•;e
habits, that are followed by irritation and debility. It will be a
grana tlring ami a blessing, when men get healthy wives, and
womet healthy husband~ .
] 18 THE rr.A":Tl C E OF
CONVULSIO~S [N CHILDREN.
A ch~ uin couvuh;·ous is perhaps one of the mol)\. li~tressing
scenes 01a.t can be witnessed, and great numbers die in this
state. .Uuring many years of pri\ate practice ir. London, the
treatment of children came necessarily much under MY notice,
and I can recall at least a. dozen ca::;es in which the convul-
sions were fatal ; notwithstanding that all the rno;:,t approved
means were used, and all the best as::;i::;ta.ncc that could be ob-
tained called in.
The ~mnmcr before la::;t my child was olightly coh ~nlsed
from teething, and there was every symptom of the attack be-
camino- of a ::;erious nature ; it was deadly pale, grinding the
gums ~iolently, squinting, and becoming insensible. As soon
as possible the partial wet sheet was applied, at the same time
the feet were well rubbed with the hands frequently dipped in
cold water, and a wet towel placed under the head. In less
than an hour all the symptoms had disappeared ; the face com-
posed, and the color of the face rather better than usual. After
the packing it was well mbbed in a shallow chilled Lath for a
few minutos. After this treatmeut, a compress was placed
on the abdomen and worn night and da.y, with the bath 1 have
mentioned night and morning. Although the child was predis-
posed to convulsions, being very delicate and C'xcita.Llc, and
teething very rn pidly, front ha.viug been nursed ~ome month~
too long, there was not the lca.;:,t recurrence of the syntptoms.
I may mention that it is now strong and perfectly hea.ltl1y, and
has never taken a dose of medicine of any kind.
Before settling at .Malvern, I had long conversations with
Dr. Gully in L01ulon on this important subject. .As I cxprcted,
there was no difficulty in convincing ::;o enlightened a practi·
tioner of the power and va.lne of the wet sheet and t::; aecom-
paniments, and that the wet sheet was '' a real blessincr to mo-
thers," and I may indeed now add, father;-; too. o
Some time after I had been here he sent me a letter in which
he related the case of a child he had been attending in Oxford
street. 'rhree weeks or so previously it had been attacked
with convulsions from teething; the treatment con!:btod of
leeching, mustard poultices, and medicines. The cl1ild rt'CO-
vered, but was in a ~hattered state, with still much attendant
apprehen::iion from debility :tnd a return of the convulsion!'>. In
a little more thn.n a fortnight it was ao:.1in ~Lttackecl with vio-
l?nt com•tdsions, " the Pyes turned up/' &c.. &c.. [t wa~ at

once put in the wrung sheet ; in less than -,aJI an hour the
child recovered its sensibility, and before tl.e hour was com-
pleted there was free action of the bowels in the sheet, the
child was quite quiet, all the symptoms having subsided. The
same treatment was repeated next day, and in the evening of
the same day, conjoined with head-baths as preventives ; by
these judicious measures the child we:at on weU, and without
any subsequent drawback; of course a chilled or tepid bath wa~
used after the chHd had been enveloped in the sheet. It is well
in these cases to pnt a deep soup-plate, filled with water, under
the head, for some time during the period that the child is in
the sheet. and at intervals to pour some of the water on the
forehead with a large spoon.
The natives ofthe Hymalaya monntains induce sleep in their
refractory children, ]:>Y putting the head for a few minutes un-
der the first ~pout ot water they come to.
.Many modes of treatment resembling the processes of the
Water Cure, more particularly those that are considered dan-
gerous and extraordinary, are lmown and practised by some of
the native practitioners of India. ~Ir. Strachen of Clifton told
me an intm·esting instance of an English officer being cured,
when considered in a forlorn state, by having a wetted night
shirt and cap put on him, and then enveloped in blankets. I
have no doubt in my own mind that many of the prophets knew
well the healing properties of water, and many of the processes
of the Water Cure as ~is now practised.
INDIGESTION AND LJ fER DISEASE, WITH ASTHI11ATIC
'BREATHING AND INTERNAL ACCUl\IULATION OF FAT.
The lady who is the subject o: the following interesting case,
is a complete convert to the Water Cure. She has been two
seasons at .Malvern with her family, and has jm;t left. It is
now nineteen months since she commenced the treatment, bas
been quite well since, and she tells me she is now the same
figure she was twenty years ago.
Mrs. H--, a lady, about fifty years old, of strong constitu-
tion: bad been for many years in the habit of indulging· a pretty
large appetite to its ful~ extent, and e11tering into a.Jl u~he~lthy
ways of fashionable hfe. The consequences were. m t1mel

Rhown in con:::;taut pain of the righ side over the lin~, and in
the back ·which wa::-; soon i()llowc<.l by a:::;thmatic breathing,
laborious'action of the heart, and therefore, the greatest <.liili-
cullv in ascendiuo· ~tair~. At the same time sl.c became in-
conveniently fat ;n the ~urface~ and ga\'e likewise C\ ery indi-
cation of a similar accumulation within, ancl u1ore particularly
of that which is so apt to take place about the heart, the kid~
neys, and coyerings of the bowels. The other common :symp-
toms of a deranged state of the digestive appnratuf', especially
costiveness, were all present. \Vith these aliments she came
to .Malvern. On my 1irst visit, I could hear her breathing be-
fore entering the room.
It is tedious to recapitulate frequently the treatment of indi-
ge::;lion and its accompaniment:); suffice it to ~:;ay, that in ten
days this lady was able to walk up the hills with bnt little diffi-
culty of breathing, an undertaking she would not previously
have dared to attempt ; the pain in the side, for which she had
been frequently cupped by other practitioners, \Vas gone; the
functions of the stomach und bowels were regularly performed;
and her spirits ro::;e to the highest state of exuberance. She
continued the treatment for six weeks, atthe end of which time,
a crisis appeared in one of the legs in the shape of boils; which,
however, did not confine her to the house. It it:i now about
eight months since she left this place, and a week or two back
we had the gratification to hear, through the mediurn of a lady
resident at ..Malvern, that she continue:) in perfect health, and
speaks of herself as " better than she ever remembers herself tC'
have been."
R£1\IARKs.-In the ordinary mode of treatment uy drugs, &c.,
this lady would have occasionally had temporary relief by doses
of mercurials, salines, and purgatives ; she would have been
(as indeed she frequently had been) cupped over the side, and
sometimes at the back of the neck; and many would probably
have bled her from the arm also. A sound pathologist, look-
ing to the case as it was presented here, would have no diffi-
culty in predicting to what such treatment would eventually
lead. .
l\lost unquestionably, dropsy of the chest or belly would
have be..en the result, if, in the meantime, some acute inflam-
mation had not intervened to carry her off. On the other hand,
the water treatment, by setting up and maintainina a vivid
action of the skin, by inducing a healthy degreeo of waste

which the crisis appeared ; and by enabling the patient to take
a great amount of activo exercise, brought about a state which
annihilated the local congestion of t~e stomach and liver, and
put a stop to the enormous accumulation of fat about the heart
and other viscera, which they who are in the habit of seeing
these kind of cases, readily detect.
AN ATTACK OF MADNESS.
There was another interesting case of madness which I shall
relate-important, as differing in its nature and mode of treat-
ment from the one I have already given. A gentleman, a little
pa. t thirty, made my acquaintance soon after my arrival at
Graefenberg, because, as he said, I was an Englishman; he
was at Graefenberg to be cured of a tendency to fits of insanity,
\Ve became great friends-he always met me with a passage
from one of Byron's poems,-" I rove the young Highlander
o'er tl1e dark heath.'' He would often repeat, "Do you like
Byron?" When I answered, he was a great poet, he would
say, '~You're a gentleman.-Is not Priessnitz the greatest man
that ever lived 7 and the '\Vater Cure: an inspiration from
heaven?'' When I replied, that I made no doubt when it be-
came generally knO\vn, and when people Jived with moderate
temperance, and learnt to manage them=selves properly, there
would be an end to chronic disease-there would be no more
diseases of the heart, brain, or stomach-he would catch me
up in a bruin-like embrace, and almost squeeze the breath out
of me, crying-" I rove the young Highlander.'' He would
add-" But won't the doctors in England, when you go back,
kill you?'' '~No,'~ I replied; "they only injure some of those
who take too many pernicious drugs, and with the most inno-
cent intentions. J shall never again take a grain of medicine
of any kind, so I am safe ; but they are not such desperate peQoo
pie as you imagine, for they do not even interfere to protect the
pnblic from notorious quacks and impostort:>, who kill whole-
sale, and not' with the best intentions.'" " Ah !" says he,
"perhaps that is because tho8e terrible persons you name make
work for them in the end." I said, that was rather an uncha-
ritable construction. I could always find him within a quarter
of a mile, by his sin¢ng his pas~wor?. W~en walking among
t 1 1~" pine trecc:: I am ~nre he f;metcd hun-..clf Ill the-
122 Tli£ Pfl~CTIC£ OF
''Land of hrowu heuth a11tl shaggy wood,
Lo.nd of the muun~uiu nuJ the Hood." •
He was going un very satisfactorily, when he went :oaming,
with some other wild fellows, to the fronticT garri:;on town of
Neisse, where he commit~ed some excesses. On his retnrn,
fever came: on, and being told that he was ill, I went to see him.
I found him packed in 1he wet sheet, quite mad, screaming out
a splendid melange of the most brilliant pas~agcs of B) ron,
Goethe, and Schiller. The wet sheet was changed aud applied
above thirty times dUiing the day; he was three times rubbed
in the shallow chilled bath, for about thirty-five minutes each
time. The next day it was all over. I found him again qnite
quiet and reduced to a temperate, and very piano-" I rove the
young Highlander," which he repeated with '\ smile and 11.
shake of the hand, and seriously repenting the culpable tricks
he had played with himself at Nie:::;se. When not under the
influence of the attack, he was quite sane, only a little too en·
thusiastic about poetry and music.
The antiphlogistic and tranquillizing effects of the repeatec.
wet sheet packing in this case, was truly delightful to observe;
for myself, l should find it difficult to express my feelings on the
subject; no leeche6, bleeding, calomel, or blisters, and in thrE'e
days as well a::; ever, and without a mark. The result was tb~
eame in the former case, by the continued shallow bath.
RECOVERY FROl\1 RHEUl\lATIC GOUT, ETC.,
AT AN ADVA~CED AGE.
I extract this case from my work on the W atcr cure : " 1
owe the pleasure of having witness~ the following extmordi~
nary recovery, to CouNT nlAZENsxr, a gentleman with whom I
was on very intimate terms at Graefenberg, and whose little
daughter I saw cured of hydrocephalus, or W<'~cr on the brain,
when in an advanced state, (J mention the nt me, as most of
one's water friends are too glad to have these matters well an·

me to a near relation-a lady between sixty and ~eventy years

old. She came under the care of Pries::mitz in the following
state: she was completely crippled with rheumatic gout; had
not been out of bed for nearly twenty yeara; for sixteen years
had been supported in nearly an erect sitting posture, with pil-
lows, being unable to lie on the back, or on either side; her di-
gestion was also bad; and for seventeen years she had not
been able to hold a pen. Priessnitz a.t first refused to under-
take her case, or to submit her to the iu1luences of water. But
from a very extraordinary tale which she told, and the entrea-
ties of her friends, he consented to try :some gentle means,
which were ne~rly as follows :-Every morning the upper part
of her person was gently rubbed all over for a few minutes with
a towel moistened in cold water. She \Va.::S then well dried, and
the dress replaced. The legs and feet were then well rubbed
in the same way, and the same thing was repeated in the even-
ing. A bandage, well wrung out, of cold water, \vas placed
round the waist, covered with a thick dry one, and the same
dressing to the legs, elbows, and wrists; a few tumbler::; of wa-
ter were drunk during the day, more or lcs::-, as she felt inclined.
She was also ge-ntly sweated, and was a tt:nv times enveloped
in the wrung sheet. In a few weeks a slight pain was percep-
tible in the back, and by-and-by a boil made its appearance,
which, in due time, discharged a quantity of matter so oftEm-
sivc, that only one person could be induced to enter or remain
in the room-a strong Polish servant girl, about twenty years
old. I saw the girl: and questioned her through the Count
l\Iazenski. The third day after this, tbe poor girl had the
jatmdice. In the course of a fortnight or three weeks the lady
was able to eat almost anything, after years of abstine11Ce and
care. She could lie down on her back for a short time, and
tum about as she pleased with very little assistance; and I
Sl\.W her a short time afterwards writing letters, which she did
half-a-dozen a day, to ~end to her kindred and friends as the
greatest curiosities, and to convince them by ocnlar dernon~tra­
tion of what they otherwise would not have believed. She was
carried every day and placed in a carriage and took a long
drive. She went on with the treatment for some months after
this, and recovered the use of the lvwer limbs in a remarkable
degree! and her general health was completely re-e:-tabli::;h.ed.
Here there was not c: air and exercise," and no particular dtet.
No doubt it will stagger a little those who think that diet, air,
and exercise constitute the principal parts of the .vVater Cure.

THE AUTHOR'S CASE:
AND RECOVERY BY THE WATElt CURE TREATMENT.
Amongst my earliest recollections are those of my mother
giving medicines and lotions to the poor; she was a kind of
Lady Bountiful, and I can distinctly recal1, when I must have
been about five or six years old, a side-table on which there
was something like a soup plate piled with pence, and by its
side lotions, draughts, and pills; these were for the poor. She
was the mo<;t tender of mothers, auu with the best intentions,
I was very nearly spoilt by indulgence and physic. I never
could ascertain the fact, but I haYe little doubt but the first
thing that greeted my unfortunate stomach on entC'ring into
this "wicked world," was a. dose of castor oil. To this day
port wine remind:5 me so strongly of powdered bark, that I dis-
like it; and black current jelly is still my aversion, for the very
name brings with it visions of rhubarb, calomel, jalap, ana
Ching lozenges. By this system of management, at ten years
of age I was a juvenile dyspeptic, with a ne,rvous system
already morbidly excited, reading work~ of imagination with
avidity, with an irritated brain and slightly inflamed stomach.
At fifteen I had lost my parents, and may say was without
control. I entered the medical profession: and for more than
seven years was seldom absent from the hospital or dissecting-
room; this, combined with every inattention to diet and exer-
cise, and taking at the same time stimulants and medicines of
all kindsl considerably advanced the stomach and nervous com-
plaints, which had been commenced in my infancy.
After taking my der;rees. I allowed myself no interval of
rest-the worst possible: f•conomy of time I eould have· adopt
ed,-but purchased half of a large nrn.~ti~e iu Londo11, cnt!?ri ng
1HE WATER CURE. 125
into a partnership--midwifery forming a part. For about sev-
en ye us J wrts actively engaged jn this, with as little attention
as e\·er to diet and stimul~.'lts. By this time I had become
really an ailing man. I was always on the physicking list my-
self- the dressing-table was covered with pill-boxes and various
draughts always ready. Day after day came the melancholy
debate: whether it \\ ould be better t ) take the compound rhu-
barb or the compound colocynth pills-with or without the
blue-or would it not be better still to try the "cold urawn,"
(castor oiL) or rhubarb and magnesia. This irritating conten-
tion generally ended in my taking, what from my feelings of
discomfort, I afterwards thought was the wrong dose-the
truth is, is \Vas all wrong. As may be guessed, I consulted all
my medical friends, and gave their methods a tri&l. I rubbed
in tartar-emetic until I had a crop of boils,-" the plague of
Job,"-without his patience,-and took mercury until my
breath was fretid and my gums sore. By this time I had
established some serious diseases. I had a stomach and liver
complaint, with chronic duodenitis, an inveterate skin disease,
and ti-2 douloureux. l\ly nerves were completely shaken, ac·
companied with despondency and nervous apprehensions, anti
irritability beyond bearing. I was indeed an old man before
my time ; J understood EccLESIASTES, and felt that all was
vanity and vexation of spirit. In this deplorable state I aban-
doned London, and for several years wandered about the conti-
nent, passing my time principally in Germany and Italy. I
consulted all the leading men in most of the capital cities of
Europe, and was still no better. I read again and again every
work that could enlighten me on my complaints, and ended,
from personal experience and conviction, in giving up medi-
cines. A fe,v leeche~, with warm fomentations, and dieting,
affording more relief than anything ; in fact, I believe these
last remedies preserved me. ~Iy ailments for a long time had
become a morbid study for myself, and I am now persuaded,
that except for closely observing the phenomena of disease in
my own peri5on, I never cov:d have understood many nervous
complaints, and the real properties of many dntgs. There are
many men of talent and great experience, who from getting
into a routine, and having nenres of iron, and the digeRtion of
an ostrich, cannot trace the connexion of many painful dis·
eases, or be persuaded of their source ; they overlook some ~f
the most real and distressing complaints, or call them "fanci-
ful." At this period I bad heard of th.e Water Cure, and s?on
afterwards a work on the subject fell mto my bands. Havmg
1~6 THE I RACTICE OF
long contemplated such a thing) I thought I under:5toml it, and
at once decided on a trial. I should mention t1mt for mort' than
twelve month::. bP.fore I went to the \Vater Cure I lwJ r~.;.i•'cted
my dinner three or four times a week,-not from ~icl\11!'~:-:. but
from the distress I experienced some hours after tnki11~ it-
there was also inveterate constipation. I was \'cry thin, and
mv cah·es completely gone. It was altogether fifteen lllOnths
before I was perfectly cured of the skin disease, that being the
last to disappear.*
Durincr nearly ten months that I remained at Graefcnbcrg-. I
pursued the treatment with great diligence, and at ~ome other
establishments afterwards more lightly. It consist0d princi-
pally in the wet sheet packing, shallow bath, sitz hnth, and
sometimes the douche. The compress on the abdomen being
ah:o recrularly worn, as well as a compress on the skin di~case,
as far ;.s I could manage it. During the first three weeks of
my treatment I suffered from the water turning excessively
acid, and from my being sometimes obliged to reject it-but
toward~ the end of the month a good appetite set in, after hav-
ing been for years without the sen:;;ation. I soon got to relish
hard cow beef, and veal a day old, with all the et ceteras of
the Graefenberg table, caring more for the quantity than the
quality. In the third week I had a ~leeping attack, which
lasted for about six days; I nearly fell asleep on my walks, and
was frequently obliged to lie down and ~leep two hours before
and two hours after dinner, and go to bed at nine in the evening.
At the expiralion of the fifth month I had gained sixteen pounds
in weight, and had all the delightful feelings ofreturning health.
In the mid~t of this :t crisis of boils appeared on the right leg,
and the pain in the right side over the liver, which was !;till
distinctly felt on pre!'surc, was remarkably relieved. There
was another curious re~ult-two yl'ar~ previously I had con-
tracted at Naples an irritation of the lachrvmal •rland of the
right eye, and from that tilllC, as soon as I went outin the open
air, I could throw ~s many tears as I plea!-\ed out of the eye by
a jerl\ of the ~cad; it had never stopped, although I had tried
several rr.medtes. I soon, howm·er, observed that it was aa-
gravateu, when my stomach and duodenum were wor~P.. The
s.tate of m~ eye had be?n remarke.d by many of my fellow pa-
tient~: and tt created a httle ~cnsatwn when I avpeared without
tears or the usual white handkerchief which I had always in

my hand to apply to the eye. It ~toppPd suddenly the day after
the crisis, and many came to look at '• the cure of the English
doctor's eye.,. In ten <lays it returned, and ran again as badly
as ever, aml the handkerchief was again in constant requisi-
tion. This failure produced despondency in many hypochon-
driacs who were zealous in pointing out to others that my eye
was as bad as ever, and that the \Vater Cure was, after all,
good for nothing: however, a fortnight after this disappoint-
ment I had another eruption of boils on the liver ancl leg-the
tears were again dried up, and they have stopped from that day
to this. The dull pain, also, which for seven or eight years I
had felt more or less in the right side, also disappeared. The
skin disease, howevPr, was still there, ahhough the itching was
materially diminished and the skin much less hard and leath-
ery. I was cold from the first that this would be a slow busi-
neas. I persevered, and at the end of fifteen months the surface
of the skin was smooth and without blemish. l\ly color had
become healthy, and I had gained thirty pounds of flesh.
During the time 1 was going through the cure, the quan-
tity of water I imbibed averaged twelve half-pints a day. On
one occasion I clrank tuirty tumblers of water from the spring
before breakfast; I \Vas perfectly well all the day afterwards,
and felt no effect further than an irresistible appetite. I was
making a variety of experiments at tbe time, having become
qLlite well, and this was nothing morP. I do not think it would
b~ advisable for patients to repeat such experiments. The com-
presses worn on the stomach at one period of my treatment, at
intervals used to be covered with a deep blue secretion, at other
times it was thick and glutinous. I also had a serere attack
of fever. The evening rbat I removed from the Graefenberg
hill to the little town of Frhvaldou, and had just got into beC.:,
(bavinu a crisis upon me,) the town was on fire. The wind
blew a
0
galc~ and the wooden houses and roofs carried on the
fire like a field of dry reeds. The whole thing was l:)o suddeu,
that I had to throw my traps out of the window. and hurry out.
After being up all night and wet- the next day I found myself
irJ a burning fever,* with intense headache and pain in all the
.,.. \\"hen I was ut college., from over work combined with other impru·
dcncies, I was attacked with fev•·r of a mixed lypbu., und bili\JUS clm-

for a quarter, half, and three quarters of an hour each ; and
then a shallow bath ; in three hours I repeated the process,
and again before ten at night. The following morning I was
better, but had still headache and fever. I went on with the treat-
ment, and the third day was out and well, hungry and hearty.
I then heard that Priessnitz, who had been wet to the skin all
the night of the fire, had also an attack of fever, and had .been
passina his time as I had been, in wet sheets. I have no doubt
he felt as safe, comfortable, composed, and refreshed as I did,
in this great and merciful discovery.
Some time after this I had intense jaundice from the passage
of gall stones; a. lady obs~rved that I "looked li~e an ora~ge in
a white pocket-handkerchief." I lay an hour tw1ce a day m the
wet sheet, with sitz baths, shallow baths, compress, and fomen-
tations; the sheets and compress were tinted yellow. The skin
was clear again in ten days, and the relief I experienced from
the different processes very great. Twelve months last autumn,
I had a severe attack of influenza, and many in this village
were laid up with it: wet sheets again, with the accompani-
ments, and I was enabled to visit my patients regularly, with
out an hour's ccmfinement.
It is now three years since I have taken a dose ofmedicine, and
in the interval have done some hard work, in fulfilling my vow to
aid with all my means in establishing the \Vater Cure in myna-
f;ive land; added to which I have endured::>.. no small amount of
irritation, misrepresentation, and abuse; nevertheless,I am quite
well, and with tho blessing of Providence, trust to continue so,

THE PUBLISHED OPINlONS OF
SIR CHARLES SCUDA~IORE, M.D., F.R.S.
It appears to me that the subject of Hydropathy is one of the
highest importance to the whole civilized world: and that its
principle3 and practice deserve the closest examination.
I think that some of the writers on the \Vater Cure have not
expressed sufficient praise and acknowledgment to Priessnitz
as the inventor of the treatment) con:stituting a. complete sys-
tematic plan.
In regard to the opposition of a great part of the medical
world to this innovation on the ordinary practice of physic,
loo-kino· at huma.n nature, we must atlrilmte a little of it to its
0
interference with settled intere~ts.
The principles of tlw Water Cure treatment are, I am sure,
founded in nature and truth, and rest, therefore, on au immuta-
ble basis. vVe have in our power a new and most efficacious
agent for the alleviation and cure of disease in variou~ forms;
and, in proper hands, as safe as it is effectual: I should be no
friend to humanity, nor to medical science, if I did not give my
testimony in it::; recommendation.
Liebig observed to me in our conversation : "B.Y means of
the \Vater Cure treatment a change of matter is effected in a
greater degree in six weeks than would happen in the or<linary
course of nature in three years."
In its progress, the condition of the patient improves in an
evident and sen~ible manner. The skin, from being pale and
sallow, acquires ':1. rn1dy hue , the muscles become fuller and

take the plact· ot languor. depression, and ennui.
'f~1e. practice h ~lot to be lightly undertaken by invalids;
and tl 1::; only the ,·otcc of kind warning to l5ay tint they ought
nut to attempt self-treatment. So called iocal diseases, but
which are really con::;titutional, require general treatment. I
heard btely of a gentleman treating hi::; knee, atll'cted with a
rheumatic intlamrnalion of the joint, by cloth:-; constantly wetted
with cold water, without employino-· any con-.titntional mea-
sure:,. \Vithin thirt\· hours a tat~ mctasta~i::> to the brain

app!1t::Ut!c~, or an ovcr-do:"C of many medicine::;.

depend on nice and currect management. How much more

tendant is of the grc;tte::;t import:1nc~. '!,here mn:;t be, in order
to success and the avoidance of accident, a good head to direct,
and a g:ood hand to execute.
I much fear that from the facility and apparent ~implicity
of the practice; and the temptation to pecuniary gain, persons
without the quali11cation of medical cdncatiun will be induced
not only to form \Vater esta.bli::;hments, but conduct them alto-
gether. and boldly nnderta.ke the respon..,ibility of the public
health. In no illib~ral !'pirit, but from hone:-)t feelings, [ pro·
te:;t aO'ain::>t this mon~trou::; pretension and error. Diagno;:;is is
mo~t ~s~ential. \Vho that is untaught and unexperienced can
under:;tand the different kinds and the many plm~es of diseases 1
and without :mch di:..crimination, and al~o ~l judiciotts estitll!J.t~
of the po\\·ers of the individual to bear treatment, how can its
amount be properly prescribed ? A second Prie::,s?itz, a. man
of so much oriO'inal rreni u::; and powers of ob;:,ervatJOn, w1th so
vast an experie~ce d~rived in so extraordinary;,. manner, !s not
perhaps again to be found ; and I hope, therefore, that Jus ex-
ampl!3 will not be considered a precedent that_ llydrop~thy ~hall
be pra.ctised by other persons wlJorly ttnacqU<ll1llled Wlth elth~r

In the formation of any hydropathic establi:.;t.r-c.~llt, water,
as to its quantity and quality, must be the first co.~' tdcration."
Sir Charles Scudamore went through the \Va'.,,i Cure him·
self for a short time, and he observes : ': The fina.! 1r.:;u~t of the
whole proceedings has been a most satisfactory :illprc)\'cment
of my health, in ali the failings I have mentioned,; and [ ha.vo
not found the least occasion for medicine since.',
In the autumn of last year I had the pleasnre of a visit from
Sir Charles s~udamore. He witnessed the \Vater Cure treat-
ment of the 1\Iarquis of Anglesey all(l other pr1.tient::; at that
time under mv care at Malvern, and he was induced to visit
the establishments on the Continent. \Vhen it is considered
that Sir C. Scudamore has been a medical practitioner for
about forty years, anll it might be naturally supposed weddell
to the old system, his opinions on the Water Cure, and his fair·
ness as regards Priessnitz, are very gratifying.

Sm,-As it is pretty well known that I have been spendin~
the last fortnight at 1\Ialvern, partly for the benefit of my healtil,
and partly for the purpose of inquiring pra.cticaUy into the na-
ture of the means now employing there for the prevention of
diseases and for the recovery of health,-it is not unlikely that
I may have many applications made to me for information on
the subject. I feel, therefore, desirous of meeting t.hese inqui-
ries, by first showing the principle-the great principle-upon
which those means are employed, and I know not tha.t I can do

M.AL\'ERS, ~EPT£MBER 9TIJ, 1842.
~IY DEAR DocTOR,
To you who so well know what a life of suffering mine has
been, it will be no matter of surprise to hear that I should have
been obliged to lea\·e home for the purpose of rest and quiet,
nor will you wonder that 1should have come to this place with
a view to gi\·e fair trial to the extraonlinary use of a simple
remedy, having, as you abo know, tried every ordinary remedy
in vain. I am also anxious to ascertain, by personal ob~erva­
tion and experience, for the benefit of others as well as myself,
what are the real pretensions of what is called u the '\Vater
Cure" to the estimation which it so loudly claims from the pro-
fession and the public. To you and to my6elf it will be no
marvel if it should substantiate those claims. You have al-
ways, in your own case as well as in your practice, given to
the skin its fair share of attention, and in my little book on the
management of health and life, published a::; long ago as 1826,
are to be found the two passages I have quoted and enclosed
for you. It was a pleasure to me to }war, before I left home,
that yon had spoken favorably of Dr. \Vilson's mode of mi.nis-
tering to disorder and disease; and I am still further gr~ttfied.
by finding patients ofyours under his c~re who bear testlmony
to your liberality r-f 1eel!ng on the subJect. As yet, l cannot
134 THE PHAC1'1CE OF
speak of my~e]f as being better, but yon know the nature of
my ailment, and will not exprct too much any mor,. thnn I do,
from even this mode of relict, comuinccl, though it l>l', with
what I so much need, COI11pannive l'epo~e from lauor.
If I am spared to return, it will be a gmtitication to me to tell
you all I have witnessed, anc~ all 1 have experienced, of the
effects of Dr. 'Vilson's varied application of his one remedy. I
have alreatly beheld much that would have surprised me, if J
had not long sinc.e learnt that the simplest means were the best
in the hands of a l\lmister Naturre, or the l\Iinister of God, nnd
had not, from a very early period of my life, tlefincd the prac-
tice of medicine (in its unsophisticated sense) to br " good
common sense directed to a particular object/' and, I might
add, that ouject a blessed and blessing one.
Ifyon should feel inclined to take a drive over anyday whilst
I am here, I should be glad to see you, and to have the plea-
sure of introducing you to the author of" A Practical Treatise
on the Cure of Diseases by Water," &c., &c.
I am, my dear Doctor, faithfully yours,
C. T. Coou.
THE OPINIONS OF
A. COURTNEY, ESQ., SURGEON, R.~.
I am convineed that water judiciously used, will cure many
complaints ; that it will cure diseases that cannot be cured by
medicines, is my certain belief; but if it can cure a variety of
complaints, it is by being used in manifold ways, and great
j11dgment, skill, consideration, and caution, are required in the
application and use of it. A knowledge of the laws of health
and disease is essentially necessary to him who would practise
it; or else, a long experience, combined with the discrimination
:>fa Priessnitz.''
Dr. Hume \Veatherhead, a man of eminence in his profes·
sion, cured himself speedily of gout by adopting the Water
Cure treatment; and he quotes Dr. Behrend of Berlin, a man
distinguished for his learning and judgment, whv say::;:
"Practitioner as I am of fifteen years' standing, and ed1tor
for s:x years of a meciical journal, 1 was at first a little mis·

trustful of thi:; novelty. auJ compared it w~th many others
whose nnthors pretL'Illled to reform the medical <HI, aud who
have complctPly Yani-dted. But. Sir, tl,at whh:h 1 ~:t\\' with
my own C) e~ at Gr~cfCllbcrg, and other ~imilar e:::talJlbhments,
struck 111e, as it will you, with a.stoni:shmcllt. 1 have ::;een an
old intermitteut fever cured by cold water \\ ithont quimne or
any other remedy. I have seen measle~, scarlatina, small-pox,
nervous f'c\·er~. rheuma.Esm, gout, scrofula, tracheitis, and other
. ~omplaints of the throat, ::;yphilis, tic doloureux, aud other ner-
~ous affections, tumors in the gland$: swelling oMlte }i,·er, and
all effects of mercury, and many other dbea:::es, cured uy simple
cold water, without the aid of a11y other remedy wha.tC\'Cr; and
in a comparatively ~horter time, and a more tavoraulc manner
for the constitution: than could have been altainecl by any other
mean5. Cold water is administered in all dbea~e~, iuternally
and externally ; but the method of application is \ aried accord·
ing to the individual and the cure. Cold water serves ~ome·
times as a revulsive and sometimes as a depressi\'e agent, and
if you, sir, had witne::,sed what I have, you would not doubt
any more than myself."
It is doubtful whether, with all our pretensions to more just
views of the art of healing, we are one step in advance of our
ancestors ; and, that our practice is anything b;~t a dh.pla.y of
our success, we have bnt to glance at the long catalogue of
diseases which remain::; to this day th~ opprobrium of our art.
:Matthew Baillie, phy~icinn to George tlte Third~ and 10 George
the Fourth, I believe abo, after he had amassed·a fortune uy
hi::: profe~:;ion, declared that he had no faith in medicines what-
ever ;- that he neither kne\v their manner of action, nor the
principle \Vhich should direct him in the u:-;e of tlwm; or, in
other wordR, that he had been ::steering all ]lil-' life without
rudder or compass. Another php:ician to royalty-the late
Sir \Villiam Knighton, observes, "'It is f:omewhat strange that
though in many arts and sciences improvement has advanced
in a ::;tep of regular progression from the first, in othc:rs it lJas
kept no pace with time, and we look back to ancient excellence
with wonder not ~mmixed with awe. ..i\ledicine seems to
be of tho::;e ill-fated arts whose improvement bears no pro-
portion to its antiquity. This is lamentably true, al~bough

cal men, and create in them an anxiety to scrutinize rigidly
any system, however wild and visionary it may a.t fir~t sight
appear, before they attempt to enter a protest agamst 1t. For
my own pa.rt, I have with astuniBhment and regret observed
the flippant manner in which medical men in general, and
some of our medical journalists likewise, treat really important
discoveries; and how, in particular, they have hitherto treated
the facts brought forward in proof of the success of hydriatism.
Like drowning men catching at straws, they catch at, and hold
up to ridicule every little occurrence that they think may tell
against the system (though such occuJTences in general are
nothing more or less than results of ignorance in those who
administer the remedy,) while on the subject of the numerous
cures effected they are silent.
But what say the relatives. the friends, and the sufferers
themselves, to the long, long list of diseases which have for
centuries set drugs at defiance? What say these persons?
Shall a system which can appeal to the testimonies of clergy·
men and medical men, of peasants and of princes, for its great
success in those very diseases which have hitherto set medi-
cines at defiance-shall such a system be rejected? Shall
those whohave long smarted under diseases the most agonizing,
without reaping n.ny benefit whatever, from medicines; who
have been for years flying from one medical man to another in
the vain expectation of finding a cure; shall those martyrs to
disease who have sought relief fruitlessly from other sources,
be denied the benefit of a system which has effected so much?
Shall he to whom returning seasons bring no relief, withhold
from the trial of a system whose efficacy has exceeded all anti·
ctpation-I might say, all credibility? McdicnJ men, whether
allopathists or hydriatists, have, it is to be hoped, the same end
in vie\\-the prevention and cure of disease, and the good of
their fellow-creatures; and cannot in justice, or with a show
of reason, be at enmity with one another. The thing is not
personal. N0 medical man, I am sure, who bas the good of
his fellow men in view, will be backward in recommending to
those whose diseases he cannot relieve by the usual remedies,
a trial of a system which aims at the same end as his, and
which has effected cures in many cases, where medicines had
~ailed to give any relief whatever.
Dr. Wilson's '·Stomach Complaints and Drug Diseases," may
also be of much greater service to the purchaser than the money
t~1~y would cost. !he latter contains a fine expose of the oppo.

oppositio~ to.. and dread of, the .rrogres:s of the \Vater Cure-a
ca~se wh1ch mdeed appears to lie ::tt the bottom of all oppo5ition
~o It. But I I_leed say no more on this head; grovelling cupid-
~ty and gross 1gnorance of the vari0us w·ays in \\ J1icl1 the water
Js used. are the reignino- characteristics in every argument
brought against the syste~.
~len may just as v.·ell argue that black is white, as argue
against the Water Cure. In gout, rheumatism, indiaestion,
bilious complaints. nervous affections. inflammatory. cut~neous,
and many other forms of disease. the facts are so numerous of
its infinitely superior efficacy and safety over drugs, that all
the fine-spun theories and cunningly devised fables of the drug-
men will prevail about as much against it as did widow Par-
tington's broom in keeping back the ocean.
THE OPINIONS OF JOHN KING, M.D.
Calling one morning upon a clerical friend, I found laid
upon the table of 1is study, one or two works on Hydropathy.
I need scarcely a ld, the subject was of sufficient interest to
afford a lemrthened topic of conversation. On leaving my
friend's residence, the result our discussion produced on my
mind was, that hydropathicism, like many of the isms of
the day, was fanciful, ideal, a mere phantom of the imagi-
nation; and that those who zealously advocated its cause
were laboring under a species of monomania. I reasoned to
myself thus: that water, a simple fluid, possessing no specific
property, could in any way cure disease; that the sciences of
medicine, anatomy, and pathology, were to be considered as
vague unmeaning terms, in the honorable and learned profes-
sion, a member of which I was proud to boast myself, and that
a science to which I had devoted the bc~t part of my life should
ever be superseded,-this could never be.*
It was not long before another opportunity presented itself
for conversing with my friem1, and the all-ab ·orbing topic wae
again naturally resumed and discussed; at the termination of
• This is the great mistake that mec.lic:al men, in their haste or f~ar,

which, I mui't candidly acknowledge, some of my ~tronger
prejudices yielrled, nnd 1 came tu a fixed detenninat.ion to pt>ruse
every work which 1tad been written on the :.--ubJect, w1th an
unbia~:::ed feeliug
The result of my i1westigation protluced the:-;e rc~olutions:
that, ~ince the ~implc aud proper :ulmini::;tration of pure water,
both externally and internally, could not be productive of much
harm, if it cau:-;ed 110 good, I would quietly and perseveringly
tP-st, in some measure, its eflcct. After some few weeks'
trial, to my no little astonishment and ~ntisfaction, (for I com-
menced it in utter faithlessne~s.) my u~ual symptoms were re-
lieved. On I procecdetl, with unmoyru, unwearied energy and
zeal, and at the expiration of about t\\ o montlu.;: though ~ensi­
ble of the vast improvement in the powers of my dige~tive
apparatus, and energy of mind, I felt almost sceptical a$ to its
reality. But it was no delusion: it was unadulterated truth, clear
as the limpid fluid which I had taken; it was ~elf-e\'idcnt as
the rays of the noon-day sun. Continuing daily to carry into
operation this most valuable <Ji~covery in the Et-5culapian art, .
its vivifying and tonic effect was sensibly felt in my system.
Dyspepsia, with its accompaniments, flatulency, painful disten-
sion after meals, acid crnctations, with a mol't unplPasant symp-
tom, generally known to the dyspeptic, a <li~trcs~ing F;inking
sen:-;ation in the stomach, sometimes approaching to syncope,
had vanished.
To illustrate this, I will simply recite a ca~e of a clergy-

.1.\Iy object is to show, that in water we have one of the
most powerful therapeutic agents yet discovered, that its effects
10 curmg disease are wonderful, and that a general adoption,
'lOW that once it has taken root, cannot fail to take place in
many and most di:;:eases.

are still opposed to the vVater Cure, and lool< upon it with a
prejudiced eye; many more among the public have yet to be
convinced of its benefits. but it cannot be otlwnvise. As with
every great truth, it i:; ~low in forcing itself upon the mind,
but in the end truth must prC\·ail.
Some medical men: de!::iirous to gi\·e water a trhl, ltave
tried, and found it wanting, through mismanagement, lack of
per5everance in themselves, or in their patients, and occasion-
ally adding a dose of their own, by which the cure was either
interrupted or defeated. The Water Cure requires patience,
per:;everance, and a knowledge of its great effects; without
these it is impossible to succeed; it requires careful stndy, and

In concluding this article, we may yet add, in praise oi
Priessnitz, that his riches (£150,000) have not, as too often
happens, inflated his pride; but that he is the same humble,
modest, and unassuming man, respected and esteemed by his
neighbors for his humanity and benevolence.
THE OPINIONS OF G. H. HEATHCOTE, M.D.
The term " Quackery," has of course been applied to this
new system. The charge is of formidable sound, it must be
granted ; but it is empty som1d after all ; it is unsupported by
a single argument, it is based upon no reasoning whatever, and
even though it be the opinion of a physician, it is an opinion,
so stated, as unsubstantial as those dark spots which are en-
gendered in human vision by looking at the sun-it i::; an ob-
scuration from intolerable light. There is no obscurity in the
system itself, but there are eyes which cannot bear to look upon
it. I, too, am a physician (excuse a little egotism;) 1have the
honor of having been granted that degree, both by the College
of Physicians in Edinburgh, and by the College of Physicians
in London.
The principle of hydropathy is that of the eradication of
disease by various curative actions of the vital functions, which
it has power to excite by the various modes in which it can be
applied: so that the remedial power of this system approaches
as nearly to a panacea as mankind, perhaps, is ever destined
to obtain."
The principle of allopathy is that of the eradication of one
suffering by suffering another-diverse and derivative. It is
an awkward principle. A physician bas said," formerly medi-
cines were prescribed less for the disease than lor the name of
the disease. Having personified disease into some mysterious
living being, they prescribed medicine, as it were, with a view
of killing that disease by poison! That which was called a
dose of medicine to the patient, was thought to be a dose of
poison to the disease. l~ often poisoneth both the disease and
THE Wl•. TER CURE. 141
the patient." It is an awkwaru principle, an<., like Russel'a
political purge for constitutional obstructions, it produces " un-
toward events."
Bnt whf~u we reflect upon the multitude of these medicines,
when we consider that each class has a regiment of species,
1.nd that every day recruiting goes on, adding some new indi-
·ridual to this medicinal army, what must be the natural infer-
~mce of an intelligent mind 1 \Vhat, but that the old soldiers
are no longer found efficient ; that at last, they are good for
nothing, and must give way to raw recruits! So that, in fact,
the general himself, the general practitioner, is laid under the
necessity of healing without medicines, at least without the
for~er army with which he attacked the disease in the last in-
vaswn.
But more than this, and worse; not unfrequently his army
mutinies ; his mercurial regiment, for instance, goes over to
the side of the enemy-itself becomes a disease-and both the
general and the constitution are at length overcome, either by
the unexpected dereliction of the traitorous drug, or by the pro-
tracted state of the intestine war ! This is to driva out one
disease by another. It has ever been hazardous to employ mer-
curial troops.
This is a figurative illustration, it is true, but it is a just
expression of undoubted facts.
That with regard to the use of medicines, it has been dis-
covered that the principal functions of the body, indirectly ex-
cited by medical agents, can be directly excited by applications
of cold water-
Particularly, that perspiration, the most critical function of
the body, both in health and in disease, can be commanded by
the processes of hydropathy, in a manner which no medicine
has ever yet accomplished-
That there is evidence that diseases whic. ~ave not been
remedied by medicine, have been cured by this .1ew system-
That in acute cases, the rapidity of the cure is more re-
markable, and that the remedy leaves no convalescent state of
debility.
Thus the principle of hydropathY: is to ~ead us a~vay from
the vain and absurd task ot contendmg agamst one d1sease by
the introduction of another: and to point out to us the imma-
terial and inherent curative power itself, which operates, not by
seeking a foreign and external power to introtluc.e int? the bod.y,
but by taking away out of th.c ~ody that wh1ch d1sea~es 1t,

midst of those natural elements which it bas power to control
as long as the Creator wills. I think this is the just expression
of the modus operandi of the processes of hydropathy.
THE OPINIONS OF JAMES FREEMAN, M.D.
Hydropathy has been too much regarded as simple and
uniform in its operation. The truth is, that it effects almost
every change which drugs can effect, only by safer and more
certain means. For instance, the internal purging of calomel,
aloes, and scammony, is substituted by the external purging of
the dry blanket or wet sheet ; the counter-irritation of a blister
or mustard-poultice is replaced by a similar power exercised by
the compress; the tonic effects of cinchona, gentian, or iron,
are represented by thobe of the cold bath, douche, or sitz bath.
This comparison might be further pursued if necessary.
The application of hydropathy, thus regarded, requires as
much skill and knowledge as any other remedial method.
What it really professes is, to po:ssess more power than other
remedies; to leave the system, not only radically cured of aU
morbid taint, bnt unimpaired by the injurious effects produced
by drugs; to remove an old disease without superinducing a
new one, and without communicating to the patient au un-
wholesome habit of body, as too often follows the use of opium,
calomel, aperients, &c. ; and, more than all, to be able to cure
or relieve many diseases in which other treatment has failed,
even wlJen employed by its most eminent professors.
In order to show more forcibly the fact that hydropathy
operates in a manner accordant with scientific medical princi·
£les, let us illustrate the above remarks by a !:)ttppo:-5cd case.
rake, for instance, chronic rheumatism. In this malady the
morbid phenomena are combated by the solvent and eliminating
action of d<
tily perspiring, &c. &c., in::;tead of the cnpping aull
mercurializing of other systems; ~his is seconded by the coun-
ter-irritation of douches and compresses, which represent the
blisters, liniment:-;, and ointments of the apothecary; the cure
is completed by the tonic action of cold ba.thing, appropriate
diet, water beverage, and exercise, which an~wer to tile bitters
and other nauseou::; tonics u::;na.lly administered. Is not this
strictly consistent with the bPst principles of medicine '? II

space permitted, the same might be shown of most other dis·
eases."
SAFETY.
It_ is imagined by persons who ha\'e not witnessed the op-
eratiOn of the water treatment, that some of its means are
attended with danger; it is supposed that weak persons and
delicate constitutions are unable to undergo its operation with-
out injury. Nothing is more groundless than this fear; manv
thousand persons are annually submitted to its application i~
the various establishments of Germany. Among them are in-
dividuals of every age, of both sexes, of aU varieties of consti-
tution and temperament, presenting every possible gradation of
physical power, even to the most infirm, and laboring under
every description of disease. Among this large number, which
comprehends ~very diversity that the hum::
m frame is capable
of pre&enting, acciJents are much less frequent than under any
other mode of treatment; indeed, they are almost unheard of.
Let it not he imagined that the \Vater Cure is disagreeable,
or that the patient has anything to "go through" in snbmittin<T
to its operation. \Yhen its use is once commenced, when th~
skin has m·ercome its first shrinking from contact with cold
water, and the glow of reaction has been once experienced, it
will not be r.ronouncec.l painful or unpleasant. On the contrary~
it is exceedingly agreeable. It is the most common of all
events at hydropathic e~tablishments, to hear patients speak of
their delightful s8ns:ttions ; and if chance, occupation, or ab-
sence, prevent the taking of a bath at the usual hour, the loss is
always rega.rded as a deprivation of one of the principal enjoy-
ments of the day.
A drug is a· substance capable of exciting a change in the
organs or ftmctior1:> of the animal frame; the term comprehends
all substances answering to that definition. There is there-
fore considerable truth in the remarl< ofDr. Franlte1, (Aerztliche
Bemerkungen, &c., p. 7, ct. seq.) that water, as employed by
Priessnitz, is as powcrfnl as any drng in the Pharmacopceia;
sincP. it may be stimulant or sedative, tonic or depressing, as-
tringent or aperient, sudorific, diuretic, &c., according to the
manner of its administration. Thus far there is a similarity
between water and druus; but there the resemblance ceases;
they are essentially difi~rent in the [:Let, thrl:t ~va~er is.alwa):s
harmless while mo<:;t drw:rs are more or lc:;s mJurwus m their
immediate or sub::::eqnent ~ffects. To sati..;fy our readers of t~is

opium: tnrpcntim~, pru~sic acid, corrosive sublimate, calomel,
foxgloYe, hemlock, heubane, and iodine, as dntgs frequently em..
ployed in meJical treatment.
Desitles the injurious propertie~ of drugs themselves, tlle pub-.
lie are exposed to another, but no less serious danger, fmm pe-
culiar methods of administering them. Thus, we lind one man
professing to cure a class of diseases by a remedy in doses
which another pronounces poisonous. (Christison on Poison~.
Art. Digitalis.)
The nauseous qualities of drugs is another objection to their
administration. 'rhere is no doubt that much mischief is often
perpetrated by the disgusting doses which are forced upon chil-
dren and patients in a prostrate condition; as, for instance, in
the last stages of fever.
A fourth reason for endeavoring to find a substitute for drugs
is the uncertainty of the benefit of some of those most commonly
exhibited. We find nation disputing with nation on the use of
a drug, as if they were discussing a point in poHtics, or any
other department of science, in which assertion and not proof
is the manner of arguing. (Compare the treatment c,fthoracic
inflammation by Laennec with any English writer or: the same
subject, particularly with reference to mercury. See also Hope,
on the Heatt, where he says, speaking of the established treat-
ment of aneurism-a I must frankly a.vow that, were l person-
ally the subject of aneurism, I would rather take the chances
of the disease than of the treatment.")
The fifth and crowning objections to drugs is, that they are
generally useless. All their beneficial effects may be obtained
from water. The two following facts will illustrate this state-
ment:-
An English gentleman of the author's acquaintance, suffer-
ing from a painful disease, had been in the habit of frequently
taking opium to procure relief. After the second day of his
residence in a hydropathic establishment, he was able to re-
linquish this habit entirely; although, at that time, his malady
was not otherwise improved.
Another English gentleman, many months a companion of
the writer, had taken active doses of purgative medicine nearly
every day for a year, by the advice of an eminent London physi4
cian. He was affected with "torpor of the bowels and liver."
He went to a water establishment last summer, and has not
taken a dose ofmedicine since. His bowels are now perfectly
regular. What drugs effect by a \'iolent, local action, water
(!ffects Ly its healthful influence ttpon the system in general.
