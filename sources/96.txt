 1/1, 1938-current  $1.50-$45.00 (plus $15.00 postage) a year.

  Originally reproduced typescript.  This was the organ of the Brotherhood of the White Temple, Inc., of "Maurice Doreal" (Claude Dodgin of Sulphur Springs, Oklahoma, 1902-1963), a largely forgotten mage in the Neo-Theosophical White-Brotherhood tradition of Alice Bailey, Guy Ballard  ("Godfre Ray King, founder of the "I AM" movement), Sylvan J. Muldoon, et al.  Like many of his peers he claimed to have spent years with his masters in Tibet.  The journal promoted itself as "especially designed for all students of Truth.  We dedicate this Magazine to those who are seeking the way to the Light of Universal Understanding and Cosmic Oneness; to those who desire to be shown the Path in an unbiased manner and in a concise way.  It co-ordinates all of the various and and kindred branches of Metaphysical, Occult, Religious and Physical Sciences. . . .  This Magazine features articles on Philosophy, Ancient and Modern Religion, Astrology, Symbology, Cosmology, Folklore, Chemistry, Physics, Archeology, Kabbalism, Alchemistry, Reincarnation, Psychology and various Religious and Metaphysical Sciences, Golden Age teachings and other literature of occult value."  The Brotherhood of the White Temple was started by Doreal in 1930, supposedly in a hidden valley in the Rocky Mountains, to spread the wisdom that he had received from teachers of the Ancient Wisdom in Shamballa, an ancient Atlantean city under Lhassa.  They were the earthly embodiment of the Great White Brotherhood which extended through all the planes and spheres of manifestation.  In the 1940s the Brotherhood teaches:

  It teaches you how to KNOW the cause behind all effects.
 It teaches you how to use the laws of health and long life.
 It teaches that there is nothing supernatural; that everything is natural and operates according to fixed laws.
 It takes away the veil of mystery from the hidden things of life and reveals them as they are.
 It solves the mysteries of life and death, teaching what each is.
 It directs you along the path of light, so that you will eventually find the master within, and become an illuminated Sun of God.
 The Brotherhood teaches the fundamental and natural laws of the universe and how to operate them, so that life, light, and power become the NATURAL THING in your life.

 Over time these assertions became the "Doctrine of the Brotherhood" in 10 articles:

 ARTICLE 1: We believe in a Universal Spirit, Divine Architect, Supernal Intelligence and Cosmic Law, which guides and directs all created things.
 ARTICLE 2: We believe that all things came into being through the fiat, or Word of the Divine Intelligence.
 ARTICLE 3: We believe that man was once perfect, in unity with the Supreme Super Intelligence, but fell from his high estate.
 ARTICLE 4: We believe that man's purpose in being, is to so order his life, that he will come into at-one-ment with the Divine Spirit.
 ARTICLE 5: We believe that man continues to live, life after life, until he masters, or overcomes life, and goes out no more.
 ARTICLE 6: We believe that all creation is moving toward a great goal of perfect harmony and order, which will some day be attained
 ARTICLE 7: We believe that the Sun of God has manifested in the material world as a light in darkness to show the way [toward] illumination and Oneness with the Divine Spirit.
 ARTICLE 8: We believe that each of us is a child, or Sun of God, the Divine Light.  For did not Jesus say, "I am in the Father, the Father, and ye in me."
 ARTICLE 9: We believe that the physical body is the temple of God, and will endeavor to make it a perfect channel for the illuminated soul to manifest through.
 ARTICLE 10: We believe in the three-fold development of body, mind, and soul, each balancing the other in perfect harmony.

 Doreal was the translator of the "Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean," supposedly found under the Great Pyramid, which provided "words of power" (Dor-E-Lil-La, La-Um-I-Gan, Mekut-El-Shab-El Hale-Sur-Ben-El-Zabrut Zin-Efrim-Quar-El, etc.) that would enable his followers to free themselves from the bondage of the body and rise to the plane of fulfillment where they could directly commune with the White Brotherhood.  The process must have been appealing since the brotherhood owned a large ranch (Shamballa Ashrama) in Colorado and an impressive church building (shown in early numbers of the journal) in Denver, supported by sales of the Brotherhood of the White Temple Lesson Course, with four Neophyte and twelve Temple grades.  Doreal also sold a variety of Temple paraphernalia.  The Weekly B.W.T. Truth Sheet, the companion weekly newsletter to the journal, regularly advertised the full line of  products of the New Thought occult mage: Healing Circles, Astral Classes and a Teachers' Class ($100, and later $350), all leading to  the Fellowship of the Avatar; a Metaphysical Church and College, a Children's Truth School, a line of incense and lapel pins (a "double triangle, circle and crux Ansata or looped cross"), and the Little Temple Library Book Series (with titles on Personal Magnetism, Shamballa, Reincarnation, the Great Masters of the Himalayas, the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, Alchemistry and Spiritual Healing, the Mystery of Sound, Atlantis and Lemuria, the Kabbala, Sleep and Death, Astral Projection and How to Achieve It, and the mysterious Atlantean city under Mount Shasta).  The church and college offered a mail-order degree in Doctor of Metaphysics, ordained Ministered and issued Practitioner Certificates in Spiritual Healing.  Doreal was distinguished by a very modern emphasis on techniques—meditation (watching the thoughts), sleep awareness, mantras, and astral projection—designed to let the student experience for himself the truths revealed by the Great White Brotherhood.  "It is  not enough to know the law—we must use it."  Doreal was an avid reader and collector of science fiction and fantasy literature, a fact revealed in his descriptions of his visits to Mt. Shasta, and by his letters to Amazing Stories, confirming the accounts of Richard Shaver and affirming his own experiences with the "Deros" of the Black Brotherhood who lived in vast underground cities.  After World War II, Doreal began the construction of an "atom-proof" shelter in Sedalia, California, to which his group moved in August 1947, in which he and his followers could survive the coming nuclear war.  The only extended account of Doreal is Donna Kossy's Kooks (Los Angeles: Feral House, 1994), 125-131.  Los Angeles Public Library; Denver Public Library; Bowling Green State University.
