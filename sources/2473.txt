RECORDING MANIPULATIONS

1827.
THE object of PHRENOGKAPHY is to record mani
pulations with perspicuity and despatch. With this
view the PHRENOSCOPE has been formed, and the
Phrenologic Nomenclature adapted to it.*
The grand division of organs into CLASSES and
ORDERS being farther ramified into GENERA, by which
means a more distinct arrangement is obtained,
and the Phrenologic balance of each head recorded
upon it, is at once perspicuously exhibited by the
PHRENOSCOPE.
The ORDERS are distinguished by their positions on
the PHRENOSCOPE ; the GENERA by their tincture.
INDIVIDUAL ORGANS are denoted by their respective
ARABIC NUMERALS. The degree in which each is
possessed, is exhibited by the number of degrees of
the scale occupied in the radius allotted to it.
The temperament is marked by a CYPHER, placed
either in the centre, or above the top of the Phrenos-
cope.
THE PHRENOSCOPE
consists of five parts—viz. THE CENTRE, A (see Plate
1, A) ; THE RIGHT AND LEFT AISLES (ibid В С) ; ТНК
CROWN and THE TERMINAL (ibid DE).
On the CENTRE is marked either the temperament
or the general summary of the head. The four other
parts each exhibit a separate order of Phrenologic
* Those who prefer it may, however, equally apply it to the usual
Nomenclature. Many may prefer the established arrangement. The
object proposed in the rearrangement adopted In the Phrenoscopic Nomen,
clatnre, is to exhibit the preponderating organs with more perspicuity, hy
placing those allied to each other together, in the same GENUS, and denoting
it by one colour on the Fhrenoscope.

organs. (See Phrenoscopic Nomenclature, page J.)
The ARABIC NUMERALS, arranged on the exterior
BORDER, denote the INDIVIDUAL ORGANS, exhibited
on their respective RADII. The numbers correspond
with those adopted in the Phrenoscopic Nomenclature,
(page 7.)
To each individual organ is allotted one RADIUS
from the CENTRE to the BORDER of the Phrenoscope ;
thus, 2, or Philoprogenitiveness, includes the whole
RADIUS comprehended by the letters a, b, c, d, in
Plate 1.
To distinguish the degree in which each organ is
possessed, the RADII allotted to the notation of organs,
are crossed by TRANSOMS, running parallel both to the
BORDER and the CENTRE. These TRANSOMS divide
each radius into several DEGREES, forming a scale.
The number of degrees filled up, in each radius,
shew the quantum in which the organ respectively
belonging to it is possessed.
The strong black line, forming the thick transom
through the centre of the scale, having two full
degrees without and two within it (viz.from F to G,
H to I, J to K, and L to M, Piale 1), is termed THE
EQUILIBRIAL CHORD, and represents PAR: from it the
scale is reckoned. The two degrees between the
equilibrial chord and the border mark two full degrees
BELOW PAR, or minus. The two degrees between the
equilibrial chord and the border denote two full degrees
ABOVE PAR, or plus. When an organ appears very
enormous, even when compared with large ones, an
exterior degree may be added on, beyond the numbered
border, on the margin of the Phrenoscope. If enor
mously deficient, the converse might be resorted to,
and an exterior degree formed, trenching on the
centre. These two degrees form + III, three plus,
and — 111, three minus.*
* Observe that, in writing, PAR is expressed by the sign = after the
АгаЫс numeral denoting the organ ; as, tor destructiveness at par, write
12 =.
Minus is expressed by the siga — after the Arabic numeral denoting the
A still farther extension may be given to the scale,
by subdividing each degree, or half filling up the space
allotted to it, by which means it will be made to exhibit
thirteen degrees for each organ.—(See the full scale,
as expressed in words, and as denoted in figures, on
the present plan, page Q.)
To FILL UP THE PHHENOSCOPE.
Fill up each organ at the radius bearing its respective
NUMBER with the tincture belonging to its GENUS. Be
careful only to occupy exactly the number of degrees
in which the organ is really possessed. When the
radii are all occupied with their proper notations, the
Phrenoscope will, at one view, exhibit the predominant
orders and genera of organization.
Then place a cypher on the centre, formed of the
initial letters of the temperament, placing the predo
minant one first, and marking, with a very large or
very small letter, any remarkable predominance or
deficiency in any one ; otherwise, place the tempera
mental cypher over the Phrenoscope, and divide the
centre, by a perpendicular line from the summit, three
parts down. (See plate 2.) Head the right division
with +j and the left with —. Then set down all the
organs of the same degree on the same lines, keeping
the plus and minus of the same degree precisely oppo
site. The base is headed with =, and is occupied by
a summary of the organs at PAR.
This being done, the Phrenoscope is finished. When
the Phrenoscopic Register is bound, a blank leaf
may be inserted opposite each, on which to write
observations.
organ, and before the Лотам numeral denoting the organ in which it is
wanting; thus, for benevolence two below par, write 13—II.
Plus, is understood whenever minus is not expressed ; thus, for pliiln-
progenitiveness three above par, simply write, 2-III,—the Arabic numeral«
always denoting the organ; the Roman, the degree in which it exists. If
plia is to be emphatically expressed, it I» denoted thus _|_,
SHORT METHOD OF NOTATION BY THE
PHRENOSCOPE.
Simply mark with a pencil against the external
margin of the Phrenoscope, opposite the number of
the organ, the degree, in Roman numerals, in which
it is possessed. This may be rubbed out, when filled
up, at leisure, with colour, or with a pen, by symbols.
SYMBOLS.
Should It ever prove desirable to print a Phreno-
graphic Cephalography, as it would be fraught with
trouble and expense to multiply the filling up of
Phrenoscopes by hand, it is proposed to denote the
various tinctures also by symbols, after the plan adopted
in heraldry. By this means copies may be indefinitely
multiplied, at a small expense; and were materials
extant to compose it, the Phrenography of the whole
occupants of the Biographia Britannica might be
furnished in less room, and at less expense, than
DEBRKTT'S PEERAGE.—(See Phrenoscopic Blazonry,
page 7.)
SCALE OF DEVELOPEMEXT,
as expressed in words ou the former plan, and as
denoted in figures on the present.
The scalecommences at a full degree subtracted from
the centre, or at the greatest possible deficiency, and
rises, by half degrees, to a full degree, added on the
border.
The scale is thus expressed in

The FRONTISPIECE, " '
for which I am indebted to the elegant pencil of Brooke Smith, Esq., a gen
tleman of this city, exhibits accurate portraits of three characteristic
national skulls, kindly lent me by Richard Smith, Esq., a very eminent
Surgeon in Bristol. The centre skull is that of Philip Barnard, a Jaloof
Negro, who died in 181*. On the left, is that of Demetriades, a Greek,
who died in England 1802; it is at once distinguishable by its elevated
contour. The third, on the opposite side, recognizable by its depressed
forehead, is that of Hypolite, a Chief of the Yellow Caribe, of the Isle of
St. Vincent, who fell in the last war in an encounter with the English :
he ivas distinguished for sanguinary ferocity ; his head was taken oft" and
given to Dr. James Barton, an army physician, then on the staff in that
Island ; it was by him macerated and presented to the late Mr. Goldwyer,
who gave It to Mr. Richard Smith.
