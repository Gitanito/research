ACT 1. Scene 1.
The coast n ear New Y ork. A m ansion a t one side.
The sea in the background. Florida F airb an k s looking
up a t the sky above the sea. A t the o th er side of the
stag e P aul P etro v k a reading a book. H e has a beard
and long hair.
F lorida: My A m erican eagle! How brave he is! Like
an eagle he fig h ts his b attles alone, o ther birds fig h t in
flocks. Soon he w ill carry m e aw ay on his pinions, up,
up, in celestial flight, above the earth, above the clouds,
to som e heavenly realm of bliss. How w onderful to be a
bird!
(Opens book and reads:)
Birds, the free ten an ts of earth, air, and ocean,
T heir form s all sym m etry, th eir m otions grace;
In plum age delicate and beautiful,
T hick w ith burthen, close as fish’s scales,
O r loose as full blown poppies on the g a le ;
W ith w ings th a t seem as th ey ’d a soul w ithin them ,
They bear th e ir ow ners w ith such sw eet enchantm ent.
Isn ’t it w onderful to love! The fulfilm ent of all our crav­
ings!
Give me but
Som ething w hereunto I m ay bind m y heart,
Som ething to love, to re st upon, to clasp
A ffection’s tendrils round.
W hat is th is love?
I t is to be all m ade of fantasy,
A ll m ade of passion, and all of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
A ll hum bleness, all patience and im patience,
A ll purity, all trial.
No, it’s not th a t, to me.
Love is a sm oke raised w ith the fum e of sighs
B eing purged, a fire sparkling in lover’s eyes;
B eing vexed, a sea nourished w ith lover’s tears.
W hat is it else ? a m adness m ost direct,
A choking gall, and a preserving sw eet.
No, the poets cannot define it, we m ust ourselves feel
it. Oh! there is nothing holier in th is life of ours th an
th e first consciousness of love—th e first flu tterin g s of its
silken w ings—th e first rising sound and b reath of th a t
w ind w hich is so soon to sweep through the soul, to pu ri­
fy or to destroy.
(The w h irr of a propeller is heard. B oth P aul and F lo ri­
da look tow ards one of the w ings of the stage. Suddenly
F lorida scream s, and w ishes to d a rt to one side, b u t in
her excitem ent she loses her head, and rem ains on the
spot. P aul rushes forw ard, and drags h er aw ay. An
aeroplane appears a t one w ing of the stage, rushes
across, knocks P aul down, b u t he is able to push F lorida
out of reach of th e plane. The aeroplane disappears in
the other w ing of th e stage.)
W hat has happened? T h at w as G erald’s plane. P e r­
haps he’s h u rt? I w as fascinated. Oh! th a t m an saved
m y life!
(She runs tow ards the p ro stra te form of P aul and kneels
besides him . E n ters G erald G rant.)
G erald: A re you h urt, F lo?
Florida: Oh! G erald! No, I ’m only scared, b u t this
m an ? Is he dead? He saved me.
(G erald kneels beside P aul and exam ines him .)
G erald: Som ething happened to the wheel. T hank
God youT-e all right. I ’ll never try to land n ear you
again.
F lorida: Is he alive? Oh G erald, I hope he’s not
dead. I t’d be terrible. W hat a w onderful face, it re­
m inds me of C hrist. He m ust be a poet.
G erald: I can’t feel his h e a rt beat. W h at’ll we do?
Florida: Oh! Take him to the house! I ’ll g et the

ACT 1. Scene 2.
Sam e as in Scene 1. F airbanks, P etrovka, G rant.
Florida: W hat are you looking for?
P aul: A com panion.
F lorida: A com panion?
G erald: If th ere w ere any graves here, I ’d say you
w ere looking for a spook.
P aul: Yes, I’m looking fo r a book.
F lorida: B u t you said a companion.
P au l: The burning soul, the burden’d mind,
In books alone com panions find.
F lorida: You are a poet?
P aul: A poet! No. B ut I love books as men. Books
are m en of higher statu re. A nd the only m en th a t speak
aloud fo r fu tu re tim es to hear! W ithout books, God is
silent, justice dorm ant, science stayed, philosophy lam e,
letters dumb, and all things involved in C im m erian d ark ­
ness.
G erald: H ere's your chum. (He bends and picks up
a book.)
P aul: T hank you. (He tak es the book. ) Do you
w ish to see it, M iss F airb an k s ?
Florida: I t m u st be poetry. I love poetry. (She
tak es the book and reads:) Looking B ackw ards by
E dw ard Bellamy.
P aul: I t is a poem. The paean of the oppressed
chanting th eir liberation.
F lorida: I ’ve read it. I t really is beautiful.
P aul: And practical.
G erald: P ractical! I thou g h t it w as m erely
utopian.
P aul: If it w as m erely utopian, A m ericans would not
have organized the n ationalist p a rty to develop the
m ethods advocated in L ooking B ackw ards. You
ought to be proud of Bellam y, he w as a pure-blooded
A m erican.
G erald: N ever heard of the n ationalist party. I ’m a
R epublican. B ut I expect it’s O. K., if it w as organized
in God’s own country.
P aul: A m erica certainly is a W onderful country, and
I ’m proud th a t I am a citizen of a country whose presi­
dent kep t us out of w ar. B ut R ussia is not the D evil’s
own country, although it looks so a t present. They have
m en as g reat as Bellam y, g reater, I believe. Tolstoy and
B ellam y preached practically th e sam e religion, but Tol­
stoy w as a g re a te r prophet. I am a Tolstoyan, although
I am an A m erican citizen.
F lorida: Please tell m e w h at a T olstoyan is. I ’ve
read his books, b u t I don’t quite understand w h at m ean­
ing you a tta c h to th e w ord Tolstoyan.
P aul: Tolstoy says the people are everything, the
higher classes nothing. P rogress is not synonym ous
w ith education. C om pulsory education h as been a tte n d ­
ed w ith harm ful results. R eading and w ritin g play but
a sm all p a rt in form ing a m an ’s m ind and fittin g him fo r
life. They m erely render him m o rt articulate. The peo­
ple know w h at th ey w ant and are thoroughly convinced
th a t “in the g re a t question of th eir spiritual developm ent
they w ill neith er ta k e a w rong step nor accept th a t w hich
is false.” “The people,” he affirm s, “are stronger, m ore
independent, m ore ju st, m ore hum an, and, above all,
— 3—
m ore necessary th an the upper classes. It is not they
th a t should come to our school; w e should learn of them .”
This, as you see, is akin to the philosophy of R ousseau as
expressed in Em ile. So even the F rench have produced
th eir Bellam y. In fact, all nations have th eir Looking
B ackw ards. The idea has m ade a cycle from the
ancient H ebrew s tc the g reatest of m odern Hebrews,
Theodore H erzl, in his Old N ew Land.
G erald: T h at sounds like ran k Socialism, I.W .W ’ism
to me.
P aul: I t is science. The m illions of hum an beings
th a t m ake up a g reat nation are reduced, both for itself
and others, to a few thousand men, who constitute its
clear consciousness, and epitom ise its social activity in all
its aspects, its politics, its industry, its com m erce, and
its intellectual culture. Y et it is these m illions of un­
know n beings—lim ited in mode and place of existence,
quietly living and quietly passing aw ay— th a t m ake up
all th e rest; w ithout them there is nothing. T hey con­
stitu te the inexhaustible reservoir, from w hich, by rapid
or ab ru p t selection, a few come to th e surface. B ut these
favorites of talent, power, or w ealth them selves enjoy
only an ephem eral existence. D egeneracy—alw ays fatally
inherent in th a t w hich rises—will again low er them or
th eir race, w hile the silent w ork of the ignored millions
w ill continue to produce others, and to im press upon
them a distinctive character. You ap parently do not love
the I.W .W .?
G erald: Love ’em! Yes, I love ’em, like poison.
T hey’re all aliens. A bunch of agitators.
P aul: P erhaps you are m istaken, Mr. G rant. I know
them , and I know they are m ostly red-blooded A m ericans.
As to being agitato rs, p erm it me to quote in th is connec­
tion the dictum of a very g re a t statesm an. H e says:
Fools talk of agitato rs, th ere is b u t one— injustice.
G erald: B ut you will not deny th a t they stir up dis­
content ?
P aul: A g itators do not m ake discontent; they m erely
give it leadership. P erhaps if these m en had votes, they
would not have changed the Socialist slogan: “S trike a t
the ballot-box” into the I.W.W. slogan: “S trike a t the
ballot-box w ith an axe.”
G erald: If th ey ’re red-blooded A m ericans, as you
say, w hy don’t they vote ? E very A m erican has a vote.
P aul: To have a vote, you m ust live in one place for
a definite period. The I. W. W. is disfranchised because
his w ork keeps him continually on the move. He is not
to blam e. This floating labor is absolutely essential to
the w elfare of the lum ber industry, the farm ing industry,
the backbone of A m erica. W ithout the I. W. W. the
farm ers would go out of business, we would face economic
disaster.
G erald: You talk as if you w ere a W allaby yourself.
P aul: If you knew your own countrym en, Mr. G rant,
you would not say so. A s I have told you, I am a Tol­
stoyan. I am opposed to direct action. I have learned
not to resist evil. The I. W. W., or a t least some of them
are ag ain st th eir own official program , advocate direct
action. A lthough I deprecate th a t p a rt of th eir activities,
I cannot be u n ju st to them . N either will I judge them .
Florida: Is th a t also T olstoyism ?
P aul: Yes, Miss F airbanks. Tolstoy says, “Judge not
th a t ye be not judged” is a logical resu lt of “R esist not
evil.” Jesus denied th e possibility of hum an justice when
he asked those who w ere n o t guilty to cast the first stone
a t th e w om an tak en in adultery. In other w ords Jesus
said, “You believe th a t your law s reform criminals;- as a
m a tte r of fa c t they only m ake m ore crim inals. There is
only one w ay to suppress evil, th a t is to retu rn good for
evil w ithout respect of persons.” O ur factories, culture,
a rt, science, civilization w ith its prison cells, houses of
infam y, and sta te church are all based on violence and
coercion in direct opposition to th e principles ta u g h t by
C hrist.
Florida: I see I should have called you a prophet, not
a poet. B u t perhaps the w ords are synonym ous. The
Psalm s are th e m ost w onderful poem s ever w ritten, I’m
told.
P aul: I am only an ordinary w orking m an, a factory
hand. On Sundays I come into the country to w orship
God by reading a good book. I w ish I w ere a prophet.
No, I am m erely a poor disciple. Som etim es I w ish I
could go into the w orld to preach, b u t I lack courage.
F lorida: I can’t believe th at, in fa c t I know o ther­
wise, and your appearance seem s to contradict your
w ords. You know, Mr. P etrovka, you look like Jesus, I
really think so.
P aul: You m ean like our pictures of C hrist, b u t they
are all fan tastical, they do not depict the featu res of a
m an of suffering. A nd we know th ey are w rong. S aint
C lem ent of A lexandria said, “Jesus had no beauty of
face; H is person had no physical attractio n s; He only
possessed beauty of soul, w hich is the tru e beauty.”
S aint Irenaeus, a disciple of S aint Polycarp, who w as a
disciple of S aint John, said th a t his m aster had often
heard the beloved disciple say th a t the h air of Jesus had
already turned w hite w hen H e began H is mission. T hat
is m y picture of Jesus, a m an of suffering.
F lorida: I never heard th a t before. I t is contrary
to our accepted representations of the Saviour, b u t I see
you are right, Mr. Petrovka. You seem alw ays to be
right, and rig h t in opposition to w h at we thought right.
(A tra in w histle is heard.)
P aul: I m ust go now, M iss F airbanks, or I’ll m iss m y
last tra in back to N ew Y ork. You have been very kind
to me, and I th an k you.
Florida: Oh! you surely m ust not go ju st y et? B ut
you’ll come again, w on’t you, Mr. P etro v k a? N ext Sun­
day, or perhaps you can come S atu rd ay afternoon, and
sta y over? Please don’t th an k me, you m ake me feel
asham ed of m yself. I should th an k you. W ho know s
w h at m ight have happened to me, if you had not risked
your life fo r me ? Please prom ise to come.
P aul: I w as about to ask you if you would object to
m y com ing to the cliffs again. The cliffs and the w aves
are very beautiful here. I t w as m ore th a n I had hoped
for to again have the opportunity of talk in g to you. I
w ill w ait im patiently for nex t Sunday.
Florida: S aturday!

ACT 1. Scene 3.
Sam e scenery. F airb an k s and G rant. Several w eeks
have elapsed.
F lorida: I t is not love th a t steals th e h e a rt from love;
’Tis the h ard w orld and its perplexing cares,
Its p etrifying selfishness, its pride,
Its low am bition, and its p altry aim.
G erald: W h at’s come over you, F lo? I t’s all since
W hiskers cam e here.
Florida: I w ish you w ouldn’t speak so disrespectfully
of Mr. P etrovka. You know he’s a gentlem an, a C hrist­
ian, cultured, and no drone.
G erald: Is th a t a slap a t m e?
Florida: You know it isn’t, but I dislike the w ay you
ta lk about the m an who saved me from your aeroplane.
G erald: You don’t blam e me for th at, do you, F lo?
Florida: No, I know it w as an accident, but please
don’t speak of him as W hiskers again, and stop th a t
bleating w hen you see him coming. H e’s not a goat, al­
though we A m ericans w ould like to m ake his class goats.
G erald: You’ve adopted all his ideas. I expect to see
you go to E m m a G oldm an’s m eetings soon.
Florida: H e’s n o t an anarchist, he’s a Tolstoyan.
G erald: A difference w ithout a distinction. T hey’re
all ta rre d w ith th e sam e brush.
Florida: Yes, w e’ve blackened them all, m ore sham e
to us. And it’s m ade us color blind. You can’t even tell
th e sheep from the goats. A w onderful rancher you’d
m a k e ! *
G erald: You’re facetious, Flo.
Florida: A m I?
G erald: Don’t le t’s quarrel, Flo. You know I ’m dis­
appointed since you w ent back on me. You prom ised to
m arry me th is June, and the day of th a t confounded ac­
cident we w ere going to ta lk over our honeym oon plans.
N ow you say it’s all off, fo r th is June a t least. You can’t
blam e me, if I’ve got it in for W hisk. . , I m ean Petrovka.
F lo rid a: W hat has Mr. P etro v k a to do w ith it ?
G erald: I don’t know th a t he has, but. . . .
Florida: B u t . . . , you m ight as w ell say it. You’re
jealous.
G erald: Jealous! N ot of a fellow like th at! You

G erald: D am n it! I did it th a t tim e. You never
know how to tak e ’em. T hey’re all the sam e, one m inute

“I know the n atu re of women. W hen you request, they
refuse; w hen you forbid, they are sure to do it.” T here’s
th a t dam n W hiskers again. (P aul is seen approaching.)
I ’d like to puli ’em. Baa! (He bleats in contem pt.)
Paul: Good m orning, Mr. G rant. Isn ’t it w onderful
today. Ju s t look a t the sea.
Sea!
Thou paragon of elem ental powers,
M ystery of w aters—never slum bering sea!
Im passioned o rato r w ith lips sublim e,
W hose w ays are argum ents w hich prove a God!
Sea! of A lm ightiness itself the im m ense
And glorious m irror! — how th y azure face
Renew s the heavens in th eir m agnificence!
W hat aw ful g randeur rounds th y heavy space;
T hy surge tw o w orld’s eternal w arrin g sweeps,
A nd God’s throne rests on th y m ajestic deeps.
G erald: Yah! Say, P etrovka, I’m surprised a m an of
your views and ability doesn’t go to R ussia and preach
peace. You don’t believe in w ar. You w ouldn’t strike
back, so a fellow can’t bang you in the jaw . . . See w h at
an opportunity you’d have th ere rig h t now, w hen millions
are being killed in useless slaughter. If I w ere a R ussian,
I ’d go a t once. Seems to m e it’s your duty to go.
P aul: I ’ve often thought of th at, Mr. G rant, b u t I
haven’t the money, and if I had , I couldn’t g et a p ass­
port, now.
G erald: Don’t let th a t w orry you, if you w ant to go.
I’ll fix it fo r you. You know I ’m an im m igration officer.
I ’ll g et you a p assport through Sw itzerland and A ustria,
and a free passage. H ow about it?
P aul: I’m very gratefu l to you, Mr. G rant. To tell
th e tru th , I never expected it of you, your views on
pacificism w ere so . . . so pronounced.
G erald: W aal, you see, th a t’s politics. I ’rfi a R epubli­
can, and th e president who kept us out of w ar is a D em o­

Paul: Yes, surely; as you said, it’s m y duty.
G erald: And, I say, please don’t let on how you got
your passage and passport, don’t even tell Miss F a ir­
banks. I t’s a sta te secret, g et me ?
Paul: I understand your desire to keep your philan­

ACT 2. Scene 1.

O lga O ranovitch. P resent: P aul P etrovka, O lga Orano-

F ritz Platzen, and several others.
P latzen: I have a proposition to m ake on behalf of the
K aiser. As you know T am a P russian official, and you

across G erm any to R ussia. W e will be supplied w ith

aid us to overthrow the governm ent.
L iebknecht: W hat is th e price? The K aiser gives
nothing for nothing.
P latzen: W hen we have gained control of the govern­
m ent, we m u st m ake peace im m ediately w ith G erm any.
L iebknecht: A nd th u s enable her to crush the w est
and then tu rn on the east.
P latzen: I have the K aiser’s w ord th a t he h as no de­

L iebknecht: Soldiers, w hom his sa trap s will im press;

O ranovitch: T h at’s w h at they call in F rance an op­

vided we are enabled to stop th is bloodshed. No price is
too dear. Then through th e Social D em ocrats we m ay

T rotzky: W e will agree to any term s the K aiser
imposes.
L iebknecht: A nd tak e m y advice, te a r them up w hen

O lga: B ut w e’re not a t w ar w ith A m erica yet.

I t ’s no use stay in g here any longer. I ’m going back to

O lga: A uf W iedersehen! (E xit Spy). I pity Paul,
b u t w h at can I do? H e’s so obstinate! I ’d like to w arn
him , he’s not one of them . B u t he’s blind, and insensible,
the first m an th a t is absolutely indifferent to me. Is he
a m an, or am I no longer a w om an? (She looks in the

sk irt and adm ires her calf). I w onder if he is natu rally
so virtuous, or if he only forces him self to a ct so ? Some
religious perversion! T here’s plenty of them in R ussia,
ju st as there are of th e other kind. P erhaps I would have
been like him, if they hadn’t given me the yellow ticket.
W ho know s ? I ’ve asked him to come here and say good­

opens and P etro v k a enters. H e is em barrassed.)
P aul: I beg your pardon. I am intruding.
O lga: No, you are not. Please lock the door, and
come and sit next to me. I ’ve m uch to tell you. . . T ake

P aul: If things w ere different, I could take a wife.
I t would be a sin now, for I could not be sure th a t I would
be able to give h er a roof and bread, or th a t circum ­

w h at Tolstoy says is the second com m andm ent of
Jesus: ‘‘Thou sh alt not be united physically to any w o­

sexually. You com m it a sin if you ever abandon th a t

there has been physical union.”
O lga: B ut, Paul, we would n o t be separated for ever.
One day I would come to you fo r good. (She caresses his

L iebknecht: There is only one form of treason, th a t

P aul: A nd I tru sted her. W hat a fool I w as, to think
th a t I could tu rn the cu rren t of a w om an’s will. She said
she loved me, and I believed her. How could I believe a
w om an who has no religion! How could she tell the tru th !
A m an w ithout religion is to be pitied, b u t a Godless wo­

she is nothing b u t a com m on P russian spy. If it w ere not
fo r th at, I m ight forgive her, for the sake of her love, if
she really does love me.
“H eav’n has no rag e like love to hatred turned,
No hell a fury like a w om an scorn’d.”
B ut a spy, in the hire of her country’s enemies! . . . And
w hat is to become of me ? W hat of m y dream to enter
R ussia as an apostle of peace! I w as too presum ptuous.
I t is only w ithin the pow er of the A lm ighty. O God, give
the earth peace. L et Isaiah ’s w ords be fulfilled. “They
shall beat th eir sw ords into ploughshares, and th eir
spears into pruningforks, nation shall not lift up sword
ag ain st nation, neither shall they learn w ar any m ore.”
B anish avarice, am bition, envy, anger, and pride, the
enem ies of peace; and let in th eir place come equality,
content, joy, love, and m eekness! A nd though I have
failed, judge me not by the deed but by the will. D eprive
me not of th y blessing. “Blessed are the peacem akers,
for they shall be called the children of God!”
(E n ter O lga O ranovitch.)
O lga: Paul, can you forgive m e? I never expected
they would discover you. I never tho u g h t th a t th a t P ru s­

P aul: P ru ssian spy! W hat are you?
O lga: You are right, Paul, but they have prom ised to
give R ussia liberty.
P aul: The liberty they gave L iebknecht and Luxem ­
bourg.
O lga: B ut they will be freed as soon as peace is
declared.
P aul: T hen they will be dead, shot by traito rs. You
are not the only tra ito r to the people. P ru ssia will tre a t
us as it tre a ts its own m arty rs. I t is only a P russian
trick, any fool can see through it.
O lga: Paul, I did not betray you.
P aul: T h at is w hy you lied to the P russian officer.
O lga: You also lied.
P aul: I lied to shield you.
O lga: And I lied to shield you.
P aul: You lied to me in Siw tzerland, w hen you said
you would rem ain there.
O lga: I thought I would rem ain there. I t w as only
w hen I heard th a t you had been detained, th a t I came,
to save you.
P aul: A nother beautiful lie!
O lga: Do you think I would have come into G erm any,
to risk death, if I did not love you? I did not know
th a t you w ould say th a t you had stolen m y passport. I
cam e to tak e the blam e, to exonerate you.
P aul: Then w hy didn’t you?
O lga: B ecause m y w om an’s intuition showed me a

P aul: Yes, a w om an can do anything.
O lga: You have reason to sneer, Paul, but I will

P aul: Prove it to the people.
O lga: If you will only agree to m y plan, we w ill both

ACT 3. Scene 1.
R ussian trenches, p araphernalia of w ar. A group of
R ussian soldiers, P aul P etrovka, O lga O ranovitch.
A Soldier: If we had only had am m unition, we could
have m arched to Berlin. Now we m ust again stick on
the defensive. G reat God, how could they send us the
w rong-sized shells, and allow us to be m urdered!
P aul: You w ere m urdered w ith those very shells.
Soldier: W hat do you say ?
P aul: Those shells w ere m ade in R ussia, to fit G er­
— 6—
m an cannon, and not to fit R ussian cannon. They knew
you had no am m unition when they charged you. B u t they
found am m unition ready for th eir guns, the am m unition
you had left behind as useless. I heard it all in the G er­
m an camp.
Soldier: I t cannot be. Such treason, no, I w on’t be­
lieve it. N o R ussian w ould be guilty of it.
P aul: T h at w as not the only a ct of treason. You
w ere led into a tra p a t th e M asurian L akes. You w ere
betrayed by G erm ans and R ussians a t th e R ussian C ourt,
and th ey it w as who prevented help from reaching you.
These tra ito rs rem oved the G rand D uke Nicholas, and
placed tra ito rs in his stead. I heard it all in the G erm an
camp.
Soldier: I t ’s a lie! The L ittle F a th e r w ouldn’t send
us to the sham bles like cattle.
P aul: N ot th e L ittle F ath er, b u t th e L ittle M other
and her R asputin. W hile they are starv in g in R ussia, the
G erm an arm ies are eating R ussian bread. Libau w as
stocked to overflow ing w ith food and then surrendered
by tra ito rs to the P russians. W hile the w orking m en
in P etro g rad are strik in g fo r a cru st of black bread, cara­
vans of w hite flour are being sm uggled through A ustria
into G erm any. I heard it all in the G erm an camp.
Soldier: W hy should the C zarina and R asputin sell us
to P ru ssia?
P aul: R ussia is honeycom bed w ith G erm an spies.
They have bought R asputin w ith th eir women, and su r­
rounded the C zar and C zarina w ith enem ies of the people.
T hey tell h er th a t if the R ussians conquer the G erm ans,
G erm any w ill be ruled by the Social D em ocrats, th a t
dem ocracy will spread to R ussia, and th a t will m ean the
end of the dynasty. She had G rand D uke N icholas re ­
moved, the only leader th a t R ussia could tru st. N ow you
are led by traito rs. B etter retu rn to your home, to save
your w ives and children from starvation, to rid R ussia
of ^ raito rs.
Soldier: P erhaps w h at you say is true, but it would
be treason to desert. W e m ust stay, b u t we w ill w atch
our officers.
P aul: W hat will you gain by rem aining? You will
never be p erm ittted to see victory. A nd the people a t
hom e are being told th a t you are opposed to them , be­
cause they are strik in g for bread. W hat else can they
do? They ask only for bread; if it is given them , they pro­
m ise to go back to w ork. Men cannot w ork w hen they
are starving. T hey ask th a t the tra ito rs be punished.
W hat answ er do they receive ? “If you don’t go back to
w ork, the arm ies will be recalled to shoot you down.” Thus
the R ussian C ourt is sow ing enm ity betw een th e arm y
and the people. I t ’s not the people’s fau lt th a t you w ere
supplied w ith am m unition fitted only fo r G erm an cannon.
T hey starved to m ake w hat th eir superiors told them to
m ake.
Soldier: Go and tell them the R ussian arm y will never
fire on the R ussian people.
P aul: W hy should th ere be a R ussian arm y a t all?
W hat does th e g reatest of all R ussians, Tolstoy, say ? H
says C hrist's fifth com m andm ent is, “You have heard it
laid down of old th a t you m ust love those of your own
race and h ate foreigners, b u t I say to you, love every
one w ithout distinction of natio n ality .”
Soldier: T h at is not patriotism .
P aul: T olstoy know s it is h ard fo r you to conceive
this, but he teaches th a t w h at is thought noble and grand
—love of country, defense of one’s own country, its glory,
fighting ag ain st one’s country’s enem ies — is not only an
infraction of the law of C hrist but directly denounced by
him.
Soldier: W here did C hrist denounce w ar?
P aul: Jesus did not forsee th a t m en who believed in
his doctrine of love and fra te rn ity would ever m urder
each other w ith prem editation, so he did not in so m any
w ords forbid w ar. B ut w h at is his first com m andm ent ?
“Live in peace w ith all m en.” Thus Tolstoy in terp rets
the w ords, “Y e have heard it ever said by the m en of old
tim e th a t thou sh alt not kill and th a t w hosoever shall
kill shall be in danger of the judgm ent, b u t I say unto you
w hosoever is angry w ith his bro th er shall be in danger of
the judgm ent.”
Soldier: The priests p ray fo r th e destruction of our
enemies.
P aul: Tolstoy w as a devout churchm an until he
heard the p riests during th e R usso-T urkish w ar p ray for
th e destruction of th e enem y, asking God to help the
R ussians kill the T urks by th e hundred thousand, then
he renounced the Church. He says the key to the Serm on
on the M ount is “R esist not evil.” This m eans th a t we
should not only never repay evil w ith evil b u t th a t we
should not oppose it w ith physical force. W hen the
churches approve arm ies, they a ct co n trary to C hrist’s
teaching. B ut the tru th is, all so-called C hristian society
is actually based on a denial of the tru th of C hrist’s in ­
junction not to resist evil.
Soldier: I t seem s true, b u t w hat are we to do?
P aul: Tell the G erm an arm ies opposite you th a t you
are not fighting the G erm an people, and they will refuse
to a tta c k you. W hat gain w ill either of you derive from
th is w holesale m urder? I know the Gferman w orkers do
not w ish to fig h t the R ussian w orkers. They are as
tired of the w ar as you are. They also desire to go hom e
to th eir wives and children. They are fig h tin g the b attles
of th eir rulers, as you are fig h tin g the b attles of your
rulers, traito ro u s rulers. This is not a w ar of the people.
N othing can be gained by this bloodshed, it w ill only
enslave the people more, give m ore pow er to th eir des­
pots, th ru st back fu rth er th e daw n of th e people’s liber­
ation. Stop th is useless slaughter! H e who takes the
sw ord will die by the sword!
Soldier: I believe you, brother. Go back home and
tell the people we are w ith them . L et them rid R ussia
of traito rs. The R ussian arm y is ag ain st th e G erm an
arm y, not ag ain st th e R ussian people, not even ag ain st
the G erm an people. W e know th e peoples of the w orld
do not w an t to slaughter each other. Send us our orders
from th e people, and we w ill lay down our arm s.

P aul P etrovaka: Com rades, I bring you a m essage

Com rades, w hile you are dying fo r black bread, the

Com rades, w hile those m achine guns are being point­

your brothers in th e trenches are being slaughtered by

(C ries of T reason.)'
B ut let us not place our tru s t in bullets and shells,

Com rades, you see these m en in khaki behind the

and the Devil tak e th e hindm ost. The police pro tect the
property of the em ployers, not the dem ands of the em ­

W hat did our police do here? Shot us down w ith m a­

place th eir destiny in th e hands of Providence. In t'
nam e of the R ussian people, I beseech your M ajesty to
give R ussia peace.
C zarevitch: F ath er, sign it. So m any people have
been killed already, and th ey are dying by thousands of
starv atio n and disease. Tell him you will m ake peace.
C zarina: T h at is not an affair fo r a child to decide.
L et the C zar of all the R ussias tell his subjects his will.
W here is m y loyal servant R asputin? I com m anded you
to bring him hither.
Noble: Y our M ajesty, the guard are searching him in
the garden.
C zar: If the R ussian people desire peace, I cannot
prevent it. B ut I will n o t sign th is paper, it would be
treason. I will abdicate. L et the people m ake peace. Tell
the people m y will. I w ill abdicate.
(Suddenly a num ber of guards appear, dragging the
bloody body of R asputin. They all sta re in horror.)
A G uard: Y our M ajesty desired the presence of
your faith fu l servant, R asputin. H ere is the traito r, R as­
putin. W hat is your M ajesty’s pleasure of him ?
C zar: W ho has done th is?
C zarevitch: F ath er! F ath er! (The C zarevnas cover
th eir faces.)
C zarina: The R ussian people! Canaille! Cowards!
A G uard: Canaille! C owards! F o r ridding R ussia of a
tra ito r? C om rades, are we canaille, cow ards?
The Red G uard: No No! T hey’re the traito rs. T reat
them as R asputin! Down w ith the C zar! Long live the

ACT 4. Scene 1.
A m erica. Sam e scenery as in A ct 1.
Florida:
W hat is the w orst of woes th a t w ait on age ?
W hat stam ps the w rinkle deeper on th e brow ?
To view each lov’d one blotted from life’s page,
And be alone on earth as I am now.
I w onder w hy I feel so lonesome, so desolate today?
G erald is com ing to say good-bye. P erhaps I shall never
see him again. Then I have never heard from Paul. He
prom ised to w rite. P erhaps he has w ritten and I never re­
ceived his letters. H ardly anyone gets m ail from Europe
now adays. P erhaps som ething has happened to him . Oh,
isn’t it terrible to feel so alone in th e world! A nd there
m ust be m illions of others w ho feel like m e today, m oth­
ers, sisters, daughters, sw eethearts who have lost the
only m an th ey lived for. P aul w as right, I feel it now.
W ar, cursed w ar, th a t robs us of all we love!
W ere h alf the pow er th a t fills the w orld w ith terro r,
W ere half the w ealth bestow 'd on cam ps and courts,
Given to redeem the hum an m ind from error,
There w ere no need fo r arsenals n o r forts.
The w arrio r’s nam e w ould be a nam e abhorr’d,
A nd every nation th a t should lift again
Its hand ag ain st a brother, on its forehead
Should w ear forever m ore the curse of Cain.
(E n ter G erald G rant in av iato r’s uniform .)
G erald: P o etry again! A lw ays com m uning w ith the
poets instead of w ith us prosaic m ortals. P erhaps if you
had not become enam oured of them , you m ight have
learned to understand th e prose of those who love you.
I envy them th eir muse. If I had only been born a poet!
Then perhaps I could have told you w h at I feel as Shakes­
peare describes m y feelings a t the present m om ent.
If I d ep art from thee, I cannot live;
A nd in th y sight to die, w h at w ere it else
B ut like a pleasant slum ber in th y lap ?
To die by thee, w ere b u t to die in jest.
F rom thee to die, w ere to rtu re m ore th an death.
Florida: W hy G erald, th a t’s quite w onderful of you!
W hen did you begin to read S hakespeare? I t m akes me
feel quite good tow ards you.
G erald: S orry I don’t know any m ore then. B ut I ’ll
prom ise to read poetry till th e end of m y life, if you’ll
only feel good tow ards m e again.
Florida: I alm ost feel inclined to call it a bargain,
fo r your sake. You don’t know w h at you m iss in life by
failing to read th e g reat poets, especially Shakespeare.
G erald: Flo, perhaps you’re right, no, I ’m sure you
are, but how do you expect m e to understand them , if you
w on’t read them w ith me. Come, Flo, le t’s m ake a trade!
W hen I g et back, I’ll come and read poetry a t your feet.
T h at’ll be som ething to come back for, otherw ise, w h a t’s
the use? M ight as w ell fertilize the poppies in Flanders.
Florida: Don’t ta lk like th at, G erald. You’ll come
back again all right, perhaps w ith a poppy of F landers on
your arm . T here’s plenty of p re tty girls over there, and
you’re not half a bad so rt of chap, w hen you p u t your­
self out to please us.
G erald: Flo, you m ake me feel reckless w hen you
ta lk in th a t flippant w ay. You know th e re ’s only one
w om an in th e w orld fo r me, and she’s in A m erica, rig h t
here. C an’t you forgive m e? L et’s m ake it up, Flo! I’m
going in a couple of days, and who know s if I ’ll ever come
back again. H aven’t I done everything in m y pow er to
show you th a t I w as a fool? I ’ve tried to m ake am ends.
W on’t you forgive me, F lo?
Florida: I’ve forgiven you long since, G erald. (He
seizes her hands.)
G erald: Flo, can’t you m ake it m ore th an m ere fo r­
giveness ?
F lorida: I don’t know, Gerald.
G erald: I know, you can, you will. (W ith some hesi­
tancy he p u ts his arm s around her, and she perm its her
— 9-
head to fall on his shoulder.) I knew you’d do it, Flo; I
m ean forgive me. (He raises her head and kisses her
lips.)
Florida: I ’m alm ost sorry you’re going now, G erald.
Ju s t w hen you’ve come back to me, you’ve got to go
aw ay.
G erald: I’ve got a hunch, Flo. I ’ll tell you, if you
prom ise not to get mad.
Florida: W hat is it?
G erald: W ill you prom ise?
Florida: Yes, I prom ise.
G erald: W ell, you know w h at a bunch of fellow s
w ho’re going across are doing?
F lorida: No, w h at are they doing?
G erald: W ell, I don’t exactly m ean th e fellows, its
really th eir girls, w ho’re doing it for them .
Florida: I ’ll do anything th e o ther girls are doing for
tlie men.
G erald: You w ill?
Florida: Of course I will, b u t you’re m aking m e quite

G erald: You prom ise?
F lorida: I prom ise.
G erald: T hey’re . . . th ey ’re . . . becom ing w ar brides.
Florida: Oh! I didn’t think of th at. T h at’s tak in g a

G erald: You said you w ouldn’t'g e t m ad, Flo.
F lorida: I’m not mad.

G erald: A nd I ’m going . . . going to hold you to it.

(F lorida disengages herself.) B ut, th an k God, he’s got a

How the devil did you get here, P etro v k a ? I thou g h t

P aul: P erm it m e to introduce m y friend, Miss O rano­

G erald: (A side.) D am n him !
P aul: M iss F airbanks! Mr. G rant! I left R ussia be­
cause a fte r w e had m ade peace w ith G erm any, the Bol-
sheviki began to arm again, and not only th a t, they also
in stitu ted a Red T error. W hen I left R ussia, A m erica

you had also entered the w ar, and I m ight as w ell hav«
rem ained in R ussia.
G erald: W e had to en ter the w ar, because R ussia
betrayed her Allies and m ade a cow ardly peace w ith G er­
m any.
P aul: A cow ardly peace! Do I undersand you cor­
rectly, M r. G ran t?
G erald: Yes, I said a cow ardly peace.
P aul: B u t did you not send me to R ussia to w ork for
peace, Mr. G ran t?
Florida: Send you to R ussia?
P aul: Yes, Miss Fairbanks. Mr. G rant generously
furnished me w ith passports and a free passage, o ther­
w ise I would not have been able to go. If I w ere able
to influence R ussia to m ake peace, Mr. G ran t deserves all
the credit. I t w as his suggestion entirely. (F lorida looks

Florida: You never told me th at, Gerald.
P aul: H e desired to keep his philanthropy a secret,
M iss F airbanks, b u t I cannot perm it such m agnanim ity

F lorida: G erald!
G erald: Oh well. . . . ! Miss O ranovitch, let m e show
you th e cliffs. (G rant and O ranovitch w alk tow ards the
back of the stage, F airbanks and P etro v k a tow ards the
house, b u t do not enter.) This is your first visit to our
country ?
O lga: No. Mr. G rant, I w as in A m erica some years
ago. It's a w onderful country, I love it, b u t still I think
I love R ussia more.
G erald: I expect it’s not very p leasant there ju st now.
O lga: T h at’s not the reason. I ’m not like Mr. P etrov-
ka. Soldiers and executions don’t bother me. I think
th ey ’re necessary evils. To tell the tru th , I’m like m ost
women, I love a uniform .
G erald: T here’s plenty of them here now.
O lga: T h at’s encouraging, Mr. G rant, but I m erely
followed Mr. Petrovka. You see I ’m tak in g you into m y
confidence.
G erald: Oh, I beg your pardon! Y ou’re Mr. Petrov-
k a ’s fiancee?
O lga: No, Mr. G rant, I ’m not Mr. P etro v k a’s fiancee.
(She looks tow ards P au l and Florida.) I w as curious to
see w hat drew him to A m erica.
G erald: M iss F airb an k s and I are engaged to be
m arried.
O lga: Ah! P erm it me to congratulate you. . . .
G erald: O r a t least I think we are.
O lga: (L aughing.) The eternal uncertainty, eh, Mr.
G ran t? T here’s m any a slip tw ix t th e engagem ent ring
and the m arriag e noose. B ut no doubt your fears are un­
grounded.
G erald: It w as a cinch, till W hiskers cam e on the
scene.
O lga: I beg your pardon, Mr. G ran t?
G erald: See here, M iss O ranovitch, perhaps you can
help m e?
O lga: Help you! Ah, y e s! I should be only too glad,
Mr. G rant, if you will tell me exactly w h at you require of
me.
G erald: You ju st said you followed W hiskers, I m ean
P etrovka, here. E vidently you’re interested in him.
O lga: P erhaps you’ve guessed a little secret, Mr.
G rant. Y ou’re very perspicacious, and abrupt, in true
A m erican style.
G erald: You w ouldn’t object if Mr. P etrovka w ent
back to R ussia?
O lga: N ot a t all. B u t I don’t th in k he’ll go. H e’s
an A m erican citizen.
G erald: W ell, if he w on’t go back to R ussia, w e’ll
send him to France, w e’ll d raft him.
O lga: H e’s a pacifist.
G erald: I’ll fix it. Only keep him aw ay from this

Olga: I’ll do my best, Mr. G rant.

ACT 4. Scene 2.
The fro n t p a rt of the stage represents an office in
New York. There is a sign: D ra ft Board. The back
p a rt of the stage rem ains the sam e as in Scene 1, to
facilitate the change to Scene 4. T hree m en fcrm the
D raft B oard of whom one is G erald G rant. P aul
P etrovka, O lga O ranovitch, and several other persons.
G erald: As you’re an A m erican citizen, you’ll have to
do your share like the re st of us.
P aul: B ut I am opposed to w ar. You know I am. 1
claim exem ption on religious grounds.
G erald: Do you belong to any recognized religious
body th at' preaches pacifism as p a rt of its doctrine ?
P aul: No, I do not, but as you have recognized this
plea in the case of Q uakers, you cannot ignore it in my
case.
G erald: The law says you m ust belong to some es­
tablished body. Anyone could come along and claim to
be a conscientious objector, and w e’d have to exem pt
him . G erm any sent h er conscientious objectors into the
trenches.
P aul: So A m erica will im itate G erm any. B ut as you
go there fo r a precedent, let me tell you w h at th e g re a t­
est G erm an, L uther, said about w ar: “W ar is one of the
g reatest plagues th a t can afflict hum anity; it destroys
religion; it destroys S tates; it destroys fam ilies. Any
scourge is, in fact, preferable to it. Fam ine and
pestilence become as nothing in com parison w ith it.
Pestilence is th e least evil of the three, and ’tw as th ere­
fore D avid chose it, w illing ra th e r to fall into the hands of
God, th an into those of pitiless men. Cannon and fire­
arm s are cruel and dam nable m achines. I believe them
to have been the direct suggestion of the devil. A gainst
the flying ball no valor avails, th e soldier is dead ere he
sees the m eans of his destruction. If A dam had seen in
a vision the horrible instrum ents his children were to in­
vent, he w ould have died of grief.”
G erald: P ity G erm any did not follow his advice.
P aul: P ity A m erica did not follow his advice. B ut
A m ericans are no b e tte r th an R ussians, in spite of your
veneer. You are tre a tin g m e as R ussia treated the
Doukobors.
G erald: N ever heard of them , b u t I expect they got
w h at w as com ing to them .
P aul: If th ey got w h at w as com ing to them , in your
sense, the Q uakers would n o t have raised the m oney to
help them em igrate to C anada w here they now are. The
C anadian G overnm ent would not have allotted land to
them , the m inister of justice would not have said: “N ot a
single offense has been com m itted by th e D oukobors;
th ey are law -abiding, and if good conduct is a recom ­
m endation, th en th ey are good em igrants.” If they had
got w h at w as com ing to them , T olstoy would not have
w ritten and published R esurrection to aid them .
G erald: You needn’t lose your go at about it. Who
w ere they anyw ay?
Paul: Scape goats, as you w ish to m ake me. Sixteen
thousand honest hum an beings in th e C aucasus who
shared th eir property in common, m ade law s of conduct
for them selves, based on a sim ple form of religion un­
obscured by cerem onies or ritual. They refused to serve
as soldiers. Several of th eir leaders w ere exiled, and
som e hundreds of them w ere condemned to be enrolled
for three years in th e so-called “disciplinary regim ent.”
T h a t’s w here you’ll put me, because you have the power,
b u t I expect I’ll g et w h at’s com ing to me, as the D ouko­
bors got it in C anada, b u t not as you m ean it. You are
welcome to m y goat. . . B ut w hy should I go to R ussia ?
W hat did A m erica do w ith its pacifists, the Q uakers?
The books of M ary F isher and Ann A ustin w ere burned
by th e hangm an, as you burn our books today. They
w ere searched for signs of w itchcraft, im prisoned for five
w eeks, and th en deported. On a first conviction you cut
off one ear, on the second the rem aining ear, on the th ird
you bored th eir tongues w ith a hot iron. In M assa­
chusetts you hanged w om en Q uakers fo r refusing to de­
p art. W hy should I expect to be treated m ore leniently ?
Y et a nam e as revered as th a t of W ashington is th a t of
W illiam Penn, a Q uaker, a conscientious objector, a
pacifist.
O lga: If you will p erm it me, Mr. G rant, I should like
to say som ething.
G erald: C ertainly, Miss O ranovitch! Go ahead!
O lga: M r. P etrovka does belong to an established re­
ligious body. The Tolstoyans are as w idely recognized in
R ussia as the Q uakers in A m erica.
G erald: Then we’ll d ra ft him into the Red Cross.
H e’ll have to do his share. Isn ’t th a t your opinion? (He
asks the other tw o on the Board.)
The Two: C ertainly. (E veryone leaves the room, ex­
cept a thickly veiled lady. A s G rant is about to exit,
she raises her veil and stops him .)
G erald: Flo!
Florida: Yes, I heard it all, and a fte r sending him to
R ussia in the cause of peace, your tre a tm e n t of him w as,
to say the least, unfair. Goodbye!
G erald: Flo!
Florida: No doubt he will be as brave under the Red
C ross as you under the S tars and Stripes. He will not
disgrace A m erica. I am asham ed for his sake. A gain,
Good-bye, fo r ever! (E xit, leaving G rant on the stage.)

There is a sign: Im m igration Office. G rant is the Im m i­

G erald: You are accused of being a Red, and are
liable to deportation.
P aul: I am an A m erican citizen. I appeal to the

G erald: Y our papers have been revoked. The pos­
session of firs t or final papers does n o t p ro tect an alien
from deportation.
P aul: W hat proof have you th a t I am a R ed?
G erald: You have attended m eetings of th e Com­
m unist P a rty ; th a t is considered sufficient proof th a t you
have revolutionary leanings. The w a rra n t need not speci­
fy any p articu lar offense other th a n to state th a t you
have violated th e conditions under w hich you w ere al­
lowed to en ter the U nited States.
P aul: You sent m e to R ussia because I had citizen
papers. Now you revoke them w ith little form ality. I
w as a citizen w hen you w anted m y services, b u t I am an
alien w hen you w ant to deport me. I w as a citizen w hen
you sent m e to R ussia to change the R ussian govern­
m ent, but I am an alien w hen I desire the purification of
the A m erican G overnm ent.
G erald: There are constitutional m ethods designed
fo r th a t purpose.
P aul: W hat are your constitutional m ethods? Y our
constitution w as w ritten by revolutionaries. As they had
a rig h t to throw off m onarchism and aristocracy and
adopt republicanism and dem ocracy, others have a right
to exchange so-called dem ocracy for som ething better.
The m akers of your constitution did not change the gov­
ernm ent by constitutional m ethods, they used direct
action, bloodshed, rebellion. H ave we less rig h ts th an
the fram ers of the A m erican C onstitution? W ere they
as infallible as the Pope ? Is hum anity never to progress ?
You A m ericans have not im proved one w hit over the K ing
of E ngland; you have m erely changed the Divine R ight of
K ings to the Divine R ight of the C onstitution, w hich, by
the w ay, only thoroughbred A m ericans know how to cir­
cum vent system atically. I am not speaking ag ain st your
C onstitution. You know it. If the m en who fram ed it
lived today, th ey would draw up a new one. M en who
have m ade a constitution would not be afraid to break
ft, to rew rite it. They would know it as a hum an docu­
m ent, and therefore am enable to change by hum anity.
C onstitutions are governed by the law of evolution, as
the Old T estam ent w as, as m onarchism w as. W hat did
A braham Lincoln say a t the first inaugural: ‘This coun­
try , w ith its institutions, belongs to th e people who in­
hab it it. W henever th ey shall grow w eary of th e exist­
ing governm ent, they can exercise th eir constitutional
rig h t of am ending it, or th eir revolutionary rig h t to dis­
m em ber or overthrow it.’ B u t I am not advocating the
m ethods of the m akers of the A m erican C onstitution.
You know it. I am opposed to direct action, bloodshed,
rebellion. O ur only w eapon is the strike, the ballot is
useless to us. W hat do ymu do w ith our representatives
w hen we elect them ? W hat do you do w ith Socialist
congressm en? Expel them . Pshaw ! Do not ta lk to me
about the ballot and constitutional m ethods! You will
not allow us to use them . A re you surprised th a t tne
w orkers ta lk of a D ictatorship of the P ro le ta ria t? L et
them elect th eir representatives according to the A m eri­
can C onstitution, let them sit in the A m erican Senate
and A m erican Congress, then by A m erican constitutional
m ethods you will arrive by evolution a t an A m erican form
of governm ent, foreseen and form ulated by an A m erican,
E dw ard Bellam y. W ithdraw constitutional m ethods from
the A m erican p ro letariat and they will a tta in th eir ends
by revolution.
G erald: They ought to elect loyal A m ericans.
P aul: They did elect loyal A m ericans. You are con­
founding loyalty to A m erica w ith loyalty to the R e­
publican P arty . W hy even your candidate fo r th e R e­
publican presidency, H ughes, says “th is action is ab­
solutely opposed to th e fundam ental principles of our
governm ent. If there w as anything ag ain st these m en
as individuals, if they w ere deemed to be guilty of crim ­
inal offenses, th ey should have been charged accordingly.
B u t th is action is not directed ag ain st these five elected
m em bers as individuals but is virtually an atte m p t to in­
dict a political p arty and to deny it representation in the
legislature. T h at is not A m erican governm ent. The
governm ent cannot be saved a t the cost of it s own p rin ­
ciples. Is it proposed to drive the Socialists to revolu­
tion by denying them legal opportunity for discussion of
th e proposed change in th e law s? T h at will only con­
vince them th a t the Reds are rig h t and th a t violence and
revolution are the only available m eans a t th eir com­
m and.”
G erald: These Socialists are opposed to dem ocracy.
P aul: The pure idea of dem ocracy, according to its
definition, is th e governm ent of th e w hole people by the
whole people equally represented. D em ocracy, as usually
conceived and h ith erto practised, is th e governm ent of
th e whole people By a m ere m ajority of th e people ex­
clusively represented. The form er is synonym ous w ith
th e equality of all citizens; the la tte r stran g ely confound­
ed w ith it, is a governm ent of privilege, in favor of the
num erical m ajority, who alone possess practically any
voice in the S tate. This is the inevitable consequence of
th e m anner in w hich th e votes are now taken, to the com ­
plete disfranchisem ent of m inorities. I t does n o t occur
to you th a t there is any m edium betw een allow ing the
sm aller num ber to be equally pow erful w ith the g reater,
and blotting out the sm aller num ber altogether. N othing
is m ore certain th an th a t the v irtu al blotting out of the
m inority is no n atu ral or necessary consequence of free­
dom ; th a t fa r from having any connection w ith dem oc­
racy, it is diam etrically opposed to the first principle of
dem ocracy, representation in proportion to num bers. No
real dem ocracy, nothing but a false show of dem ocracy,
is possible w ithout it'.
G erald: You m ean to say the A m erican people have
no liberties?
P aul: The people, it is true, have m any liberties on
paper, but th ey are fictitious, and w ill never be tru e and
su b stan tial so long as they depend on the plutocracy.
Thus, fo r exam ple, a w orkm an m ay offer him self as a
m em ber to C ongress, b u t his w an t of m oney practically
places an insuperable barrier in the w ay of his am bition,
fo r votes are bought, in spite of the ballot, and every
election costs a little fortune. N othing is m ore easy th an
to evade the co rru p t practices bill; electoral corruption
can be practised in a hundred w ays and under skillfully
disguised form s. B u t w hy don’t you deport B ry an ? He
says exactly w h at I say: “The D em ocratic p arty will
distinguish betw een evolution and revolution, g u aran tee­
ing freedom of speech and press to every one who advo­
cates changes by constitutional m ethods. The D em o­

hiding m y identity. B ut I am not a Red, I am not a Com­

B ut to revert. A t all tim es the conservative party,
w hen stro n g enough to enforce its will, has been a party
to persecution. I t poisoned Socrates; it crucified C hrist;
it threw the C hristians to the wild beasts in the R om an
am phitheatre; it established the Inquisition; it forced
Galileo to confess th a t th e earth stands still; it laid its
paralyzing hand upon Colum bus; it kindled the fires a t
Sm ithfield; it gibbeted Q uakers; it persecuted A rkw right;
it laughed a t P ulton, etc., etc. I t alw ays w as, it is now,
and alw ays w ill be, like a purblind bat, terrified a t the
breaking of the dawn, fearful th a t the universe is to be
given over w ith the rising sun to inextinguishable con­
flagration.
G erald: W ill you deny th a t you are a B olshevist?
P au l: I am n o t a Bolshevist, except in so fa r as Bol­
shevism w ishes to carry out the ideas of Bellam y.
G erald: M iss O ranovitch, didn’t P etro v k a represent
the Bolsheviki in R ussia?
O lga: H e w as th eir envoy to the C zar w ith the peace
treaty , but he w as opposed to the Red T error.
G erald: If he w as th eir envoy, he w as in sym pathy
— 11—
w ith them , and w e’ll give him a chance to live under the
Red Terror.
P aul: I believe you will not have th a t satisfaction.
The T error has been abolished. L isten to this:
“Only the en ten te’s renew al of arm ed intervention
or the giving of m aterial help to rebellious C zar’s generals
in attem p ts to overthrow the position of the soviet gov­
ernm ent and the peaceful labor of the w orkers and
peasants tow ards the organization of socialistic responsi­
bility for the fu tu re w ill bring a reversion by the soviet
governm ent to the drastic m ethods of the Red T error.
“Therefore the all R ussian special com m ittee m ust
decide, first, to discontinue forthw ith the extrem e penalty
by sentence of th e all-R ussian com m ittee or local
benches; second, to direct Com rade C zergninsky to bring
before the soviet of people’s com m issaries and before the
all R ussian central executive com m ittee a bill for total
abolition of capital punishm ent.”
G erald: X hope you’ll have a good tim e then. If the
Bolsheviki hadn’t interfered in A m erican affairs, we
m ight have let you stop here.
P aul: In terfered in A m erican affairs! W hat is the
A m erican arm y doing in S iberia? W ho supplied am ­
m unition and funds to K olchak ? Do you know w hat
K olchak w as? K olchak w as nothing b u t a reactionary.
The people, determ ined fo r peace, w ere forced into the
arm y, dressed in B ritish uniform s, and driven tow ards
the front. Over all g re a t Siberia the reactionary gen­
erals and C ossack atam an s raised and drafted arm ies
by cruelties th a t outdid the w orst efforts of the Bolshe­
viki. All Siberia echoed w ith th e cries of th e to rtu red
m en terrorized by th e orders of officers m asters in the
a rt of terrorism . In stead of reform s by a loved assem bly,
K olchak gave them only prom ises and terrorism . T h at if
w h at you A m ericans supported. W hat is K olchalk to ­
day ? A beaten, lost, trag ic figure whose title of suprem e
ruler is a m ockery and byword.
G erald: The A m erican arm y is being w ithdraw n.
P a u l: The A m erican arm y is retirin g from danger,
because its allies are defeated and discredited.
G erald: If things are like th a t over there, you ought
to be glad to go there. A nyw ay you’ve got no kick com­
ing. The Bolsheviki G overnm ent asked us to send you
there, and w e’re sim ply obeying th eir pleasure. Besides
don’t you th in k it’d be a good th in g fo r you to go and
have a personal try -o u t of the Bolshevik G overnm ent,
before you try to force it on us? You ought to be glad
of the opportunity to live under th a t G overnm ent.
I understand R ussia is a w onderful country. P erhaps
one day you will be glad th a t we sen t you there. I t m ay
be a blessing in disguise. My only fear is th a t millions
of w orking m en and idealists will follow you a t th eir own
expense, if the people succeed over there. P erhaps it
would be b e tte r to give you a little corner in the U.S. ta
try out your form of governm ent.
Y our form of governm ent m ay be O.K. for you peo­
ple, b u t it doesn't suit us. E verybody’s got a rig h t to his
own idea of governm ent. We w ant ours, and w e’re only
too glad to give you the opportunity of enjoying yours.
W e are not tre a tin g you as crim inals, we are sim ply
expelling you, as the H uguenots w ere expelled from
France. You m ay w in im m ortality as they did. Now’s
your chance. P erhaps th is is the finest thing th a t could
happen to R ussia. C enturies ago E urope shipped its
radicals to A m erica and helped build up the A m erican
Republic. W e are now shipping radicals to R ussia. P e r­
haps a sim ilar resu lt w ill take place there. You m ay
build up a g re a t R ussian E m pire.
P aul: You are right, Mr. G rant. You sent me before
as an apostle of peace, now you are sending me as a
p rotagonist of economic justice. M ay God give me the
stren g th to fulfill m y second and g re a te r mission. I t is
over there th a t the em ancipation of hum anity is to be
w orked out, not here. You are too young. I once thought
w e had a president who w ould keep us out of w ar. I w as
disillusioned. Then I tho u g h t we had a president who had
given hum anity a L eague of N ations. I w as disabused.
H e plagiarized it from Europe, from G ustaf B jorklund’s
Fusion of the N ations, though he m ay also have had in
m ind the L eague of the Iroquois form ed by H iaw atha. I
th an k you fo r another free passage, a passage on the
A rk. I only hope I am not leaving you to a deluge.
(All exit except P etrovka, O ranovitch, and a G uard.)
L ittle does he understand th a t I am less welcom e in
R ussia today, th a n I am in A m erica; th a t they m ay have
asked for m e m erely to destroy me. Should I claim m y
b irth rig h t? B ut R ussia requires me m ore today th an

portunity of seeing F lorida once more, to tell her th a t I
love her, th a t w h at I have done w as fo r hum anity and
n o t ag ain st A m erica. . . I had dream ed a dream , b u t how
can I ask her to follow me, an outcast, to R ussia. Y et
one day, san ity m ay reign over th is distracted earth
again, perhaps I will be able to come back to this country
again, or I m ay be perm itted to build a hom e for her in
a freer and happier R ussia. . . I have told it all to her, she
w ill understand me. Olga, w ill you tak e this le tte r to
her ? Tell h er w h at I have told you, say good-bye to her
for me, or, perhaps she m ay come to bid farew ell to one
who is branded an enem y of her country. (O lga tak es
the letter. P etro v k a and the G uard exeunt.)
O lga: Shall I do it? Do I love him so much, th a t I
should sacrifice m y happiness for h is? I would be a
fool! Such things are done in m elodram a, not in real life.
E ven if he does not love me now, who know s w h at tim e
m ay bring fo rth ? W hen I have him back in R ussia, I
will not let him escape so easily again. There I have

CHAPTER 2
W hose life, w hich fam ily, w hat nation develops ac­
cording to plan? W ho know s w hat or w here he w ill be
tom orrow ? C ross currents are constantly changing the
destinies of m an, especially in A m erica, w here im m igra­
tion, diaspora, and divorce b reak up and rebuild fam ilies
in every-changing p attern s. Today a m an m ay be a
pauper, tom orrow a plutocrat; today a gangster, tom or­
row a paragon; today a Jew , tom orrow a Gentile. E very
hum an being is a potential D octor Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde.
Some of our m ost hardened crim inals have led exem plary
lives a t home, loving and being loved by their fam ilies
and by others who w ere unacquainted w ith their crim e
record and refused to believe it even w hen confronted
w ith the m ost dam ning evidence.
Life is a m ixture of good and evil, a flux betw een
extrem es. T ake the line-up of nations during W orld W ar
One, com pare it w ith th a t of W orld W ar Two, and con­
sider them w ith the line-up th a t is now shaping for W orld
W ar Three.
Be not therefore surprised or incredulous of the
tergiversations of our characters!
A fter the F ranco-P russian W ar, F rance w as bled
w hite, depleted of m en and money. G am betta, sauveur
de la patrie, m y kinsm an, whose nam e in m em ory of his
inveterate enm ity to im perialism I bestow ed on m y son,
resussitated F rance and during the G reat W ar, L a P a trie
took revanche.
R evenge is sure, though som etim es slowly paced!
Did any sane m an believe th a t G erm any would ever
forget the G reat W ar, or the causes of her debacle? The
defection of Ita ly aggrav ated by the bom bast of h er dic­
ta to r, the w eaker and th e closer foe, w ill first be dealt
w ith by a resurrected G erm any. Thus ran the thoughts
of men in those days. Ita ly will be crushed or absorbed.
Then those who claim to have “won the w ar,” who p re­
vented the subiugation of Europe, will be rendered
innocuous or attacked. How or w hen, God alone knows,
b u t it is as inevitable as the precession of the equinoxes.
And then R ussia!
G erm any w as not bled w hite. The sixty million peo­
ple, the eighty billion dollars w orth of w ealth, the n atu ral
resources, scientific m ethods, organized industry, and will
to propagate and in filtrate w ere still intact.
A dm it this, and adm it it you m ust, and the L ast
D ays of th e Republic w ere w ithin the range of realiza­
tion, though conceived in the realm of im agination.
Thus the prophets prophesied. B ut R ussia brooded
and belched and W orld W ar Two w as whelped.
The Dav. the anniversary of the p act signed in the
Old W orld, the capital of the g reatest nation in the world,
th e pomp and p ag ean try of those who “w on the w ar.”
The sun glanced from the resplendent capitol, the
throngs lining the m agnificent avenues, turned in ex­
pectation, seem ed to reflect its light from their glow ing
faces. P latinum and diam onds, gold braid and polished
scabbards, carm ined lips and cheeks, w aving plum es,
pow dered arm s and bosoms, b rilliant uniform s, shim m er­
ing nylon-clad lim bs, and clanking silver spurs, threw
back the ray s of the sun and dazzled the m en clad in dull
khaki.
Some of th e faces overshadow ed by the clum sy
helm ets w ere draw n and set in co n trast to those th a t
gazed a t them in adm iration. A rm less, legless, eyeless,
even senseless, m any of them thought th a t they had paid
w ith penury, w ith th eir flesh, blood and bone, for all this
luxurious w ealth and physical perfection. P erhaps they
w ere not dazzled, th eir eyes m erely narrow ed in reflec­
tion.
M any who face the footlights w ith sm ooth faces,
portly figures, and costly toilettes, no doubt behind the
scenes are w rinkled, lean and ragged. As the acto r so
th e soldier has alw ays used cam ouflage.
B eneath the beautiful lillies th a t a ttra c t the bees and
the birds w ith th eir inim itable form s, refulgent hues and
sw eet scents, lies the repulsive, m alodorous sw am p, the
m anure th a t gives them nourishm ent. In juxtaposition
to the beautiful w om en th a t a ttra c t th e m ale w ith th eir
rounded figures and redolent persons, fascinating w ith
color and clothes, is the carnage of peace, billions of in­
nocent creatu res slaughtered and robbed for food, habili­
m ent, w arm th, m ere adornm ent; m illions of toilers in th e
mines, in the m arts, in the factories, in the fields, who
have paid w ith th eir lives for bare existence; and the
carnage of w ar, personified by these m aim ed veterans —•
all, the fertilizer on w hich these row s of hum an orchids
thrive.
The draw n, set faces, the narrow ed eyes, darkened
by the dull helm ets, had left arm s and legs beneath
barbed-w ire entanglem ents. Is ^it any w onder th a t
foreign entanglem ents failed th is day to brin g a glow to
th eir faces ?
The dream or schem e of a form er president w as an
accom plished fact. Through revulsion and vicissitude the
L eague of N ations had passed unscathed, had become the
U nited N ations. Fickle public opinion, so tru ly lim ned in
S hakespeare’s Julius Caesar, had reversed th a t presi­
den t’s dicta as he him self had done, and forgotten an other
president’s dam ning judgm ent.
“Mr. Roosevelt spoke of the L usitania dead w ith the
burning anger th a t anim ated his countrym en for one brief
m om ent before the P resident told the w orld they w ere
‘too proud to fig h t.’ Of th is phrase Mr. R oosevelt said:
“ ‘I t is one of those dreadful phrases w hich, as by a
lightning flash, illum ines the soul of the m an using it
and rem ains forever fixed in th e m inds of m ankind in
connection w ith th a t m an. B ut this is not all. W hen
the m an is P resident of the U nited S tates it is a sad and
dreadful thing th a t the sham e is necessarily shared by the
nation itself; and it is com pletely assum ed by the nation
if it fails to repudiate the m an who u ttered the phrase.’
“N or w as th is phrase an isolated one. Mr. Roosevelt
disinterred the equally pusillanim ous rem ark m ade by
the P resident less th an three w eeks a fte r th e L usitania
sinking, when, in refusing an invitation for an Independ­
ence D ay address, he said: ‘This is perhaos the very tim e
w hen I would not care to arouse the sentim ent of
patrio tism .’ Said Mr. R oosevelt:
“ ‘M ost assuredly, m y fellow countrym en, th e A m eri­
can Republic w ill not live, and will not deserve to live,
if for the views of th e m en who signed th e D eclaration
of Independence on July 4, 1776. we sub stitu te as the
basis of national action the views of the P resident who
one hundred and tw enty-eight years la te r declined to
speak in com m em oration of the day because in a danger­
ous crisis it seem ed to his cold h e a rt unw ise ‘to arouse
the spirit of patriotism .’ ”
Today W ilson w as “our fighting president.” “the
g re a t p atrio t,” and Roosevelt, th e p a rtrio t and fighter,
who dared to bandy the idle oratory: “The A m erican R e­
public will not live and will not deserve to live.” w itnessed
his rival’s m em ory arouse the sp irit of p atriotism
B ut th ey w ere both long in th eir tom bs. A nother
generation th a t knew them not lined th e avenues of
W ashington, and a president who had not y et acquired,
a sobriouet from the people strode a t the head of the
procession.
B ut such m en though they m ay be m ere fig u re­
heads in life, often gain im m ortalitv through the m an ­
n er of th eir deaths; so let us not iudge him by his m ere
patronvm . P resident E agle would never have been the
natio n ’s nominee, fo r the sim ple reason th a t the nation
did not know him . B ut the president-m akers knew him
and th a t w as sufficient to cause his nom ination. Mr.
Eagle, Republican, w as given a platform , literal and
— 13—
literary, if one m ay call the press literary , and th a t suf­
ficed to assure his election. P rosperity, no radical legis­
lation, protection for vested rights, a few bills th a t would
n o t prevent (a euphem ism for favor) th e accum ulation
of g reat fortunes, a franchise here and there, the appoint­
m ent of several safe judges to the Suprem e Bench, and
the usual patronage, nepotism , and universal change in
personnel atten d an t on every election! Of course I have
n o t given th e platform literally, h u t th a t w as its in ten t
and purpose in th e m inds of its fram ers.
The reader m ust not think th a t th ere w ere no men
in A m erica a t th e tim e under review. There were. As
one m an of the day tersely proclaim ed:
“There are m any Lincolns in A m erica today, but
none will ever be president. Those who control th e poll­
ing booths do n o t w an t a president, th ey w an t a pim p;
those who go to the booths are principally gun-m en, po­
litical job-holders or -hunters, th e bosses and the w age-
slaves of larg e financial, com m ercial and industrial gangs
who receive or expect special privileges; those w ho stay
aw ay from the booths are pusillanim ous castrato s alw ays
chanting a sw an song, th eir citizenship should be re ­
voked.”
Close behind the president and his cabinet, and in
strik in g co n trast to the sim ple dress of the Republic,
cam e the representatives of all the other m em bers of the
U nited N ations — princes, earls, dukes, barons, knights,
scintillating in foreign uniform s, foreign orders, foreign
decorations, foreign m edals, but m ost of them accom pa­
nied by indigenous spouses.
Somehow m any of th e faces of the husbands w ere not
as exotic as th eir apparel, in fact am ong them w ere the
sons of A m erican m others; a prince and an earl, sons of
A m erican fath ers and m others: a lord and a baron who
had once been A m erican-born billionaires.
W hat a trium ph fo r the daughters of the Republic
who had laid th eir v irtue and th eir greenbacks under the
venal venery of titled attaches. This procession w as
theirs, th eirs the apotheosis, theirs th e deification. They
w ere the cynosures, the raison d’etre of this dem onstra­
tion.
Of course n o t all of them had bought th is lure of
m onarchism w ith virtue. M any had journeyed to foreign
lands and paid only dollars fo r th eir titles. A m ong such
w as th e D uchess of Albion, nee M ary M orning, daughter
of P rice M orning, the richest m an in th e world, w ife of
the B ritish A m bassador, the D uke of Albion, the scion
of one of the oldest and proudest houses related to the
king of England.
As the D uke and Duchess, both m agnificent speci­
m ens of hum anity physically, tall, haughty, perhaps dis­
dainful of low er ran k and lesser w ealth th a t stru tte d at
its side in th is republic, m arched ‘p a st the balcony oc­
cupied by P rice M orning, M aud M orning, his youngest
daughter; P a tric k Filligin, leader of the Irish-A m ericans;
Rudolph R othkopf, G erm an-A m erican head of th e B eer-
bibber P a rty ; and P aul Pidus w hom w e have m et before
as P aul P etro v k a; they acknow ledged th e flu tte r of hand­
kerchiefs w ith becom ing dignity and passed on.
How cam e P aul to be in this entourage? A fter the
F irst W orld W ar, it had been easy for him to return,
sim ply by declaring his A m erican citizenship. D isillu­
sioned by w h at he had seen and suffered in R ussia, he
had also lost faith in th e practicability of Tolstoy’s
doctrines. H e had never been a com m unist or socialist
in the accepted sense.
One of his first acts a fte r his arriv al in A m erica w as
to visit th e house of Florida F airbanks. E nquiries
elicited th e inform ation of h er death, and th a t she w as
really the daughter of one Price Lupus. This im ­
m ediately set up a w hirloool of m em ories from his boy­
hood; the death of his sister. A ngelica, the facts of w bi'’*'
w ere unknow n to him ; th e death of his fath er, Felix
Fidus; and his o r a flig h t from hom e in th e W est to m ake
his own w ay in the world.
W here w as Tunus ? W hat had becom e of his d aught­
ers, especially of M aud, his school com panion?
P aul w ent W est, and it did not ta k e him long to
discover the fa c t now alm ost forgotten, th a t Price
M orning w as no other th an his fa th e r’s form er partner,
Lupus.
He did n o t w ish to see Lupus nor investigate his
fa th e r’s financial estate, b u t an ineradicable yearning to
see once again the com panion of his childhood, urged
him to seek an interview w ith her, and she a fte r th eir
first m eeting refused categorically to let him depart,
despite the rem onstrances of her father.
W hat stran g e bedfellows!
* * * *
"D oesn’t she look gran d ,” cried M aud. “The m ost
beautiful, th e m ost stately w om an in the procession. I
th in k I envied her and w ished m yself in h er place. The
th rill of patriotism , the consciousness of being a m em ber
of a g re a t and glorious nation, m ust be m ore intense in
those who ta k e p a rt th an is us, m ere spectators.”
“W hich nation have you in mind, M iss M orning?”
queried Pilligin.
“W hy, A m erica, of course,” reto rted M aud giving him
a rapid look out of her large brow n eyes.
“I thou g h t you m ight m ean the D uke’s,” said Pilligin
w ith a touch of unconcealed irony in his stentorian voice.
“A nd w hy n o t? ” interposed M orning. “Isn ’t the
B ritish E m pire a g re a t and glorious nation, one th a t w e
m ight be proud of ? W hy shouldn’t M aud envy h er sister,
or ra th e r w hy should she? Look a t her! Isn ’t she as
beautiful, as stately. No, dam n it, she’s m ajestic, w orthy
of a prince, th e Prince of W ales if you like, and to w ear
the crow n of th e B ritish E m pire itself, dam n it!”
M orning banged his larg e hand on th e balustrade
covered w ith festoons of purple velvet, M aud blushed a
deep scarlet alm ost indistinguishable from th e bunting,
and low ered her eyes, th e th ree m en looked a t the pon­
derous plu to crat in reflective silence.
M orning w as not in th e hab it of using idle w ords.
H is w ords either expressed or hid his thoughts. W hich
w as it now ? Rum or, even the press, had connected the
nam e of the p lu to crat’s second d aughter w ith a prince.
P ractically every E uropean country w as M orning’s
debtor, he could dictate term s, even to the B ritish Em pire,
his g reatest debtor. If M aud wished, and if he p u t th a t
heavy fist of his down, perhaps, w ho know s, one of his
progeny m ight rule the B ritish E m pire. H is own fa th e r
and m other w ere both born in the B ritish Isles. Since
th e m ining properties his fa th e r had left him had been
increased to the g reatest fortune in th e world, since his
eldest daughter had m arried an E nglish duke, genealogists
had discovered th a t the D uchess’ ancestry could be traced
back to the tim e of W illiam th e Conqueror, and th a t only
a fte r the D ues de M aurnayng had been reduced to the
sta tu s of comm on m erchants w as the nam e curtailed to
plain Mr. M orning. Since P rice M orning, or to be m ore
exact since archaeologists in the pay of the D uchess
M ary, had unearthed w h at th ey claim ed to be the ancient
keep of M aurnayng. and since the site had been obliter­
ated by a m agnificent palace, the C astle de M aurnayng,
w hich had cost P rice tw en ty million E nglish pounds,
th ere had been ta lk of reviving th e title of the D ues de
M aurnayng, b u t Price in the august presence of the D uke
and Duchess, and w ithout the least consideration for
th eir dignity, had banged his fist on th e table and
shouted:
“D am n it! I ’m no dook, and I don’t w an t anybody
dooking me. Price M orning is good enough for me, and
the clim ate of N ew Y ork suits m y constitution. You can
have the P alace de M aurnayng, and loan m e a couple of
room s w hen I ru n over for business.”
“But, Mr. M orning,” suggested th e Duke, “Mr. C ar­
negie lived in his castle in Scotland.”
“Y ah,” thundered M orning, “b u t I ain’t n u tty about
golf, and old A ndrew died plain Mr. C arnegie. N othing
doing, dam n it!”
“B ut. dad.” pleaded the D uchess M ary, “th in k of
M aud! As the d aughter of a duke and w ith your pow er
and, and influence, she m ight do even b e tte r th an I.”
“Yes, undoubtedly,” acquiesced his G race as his
spouse turned tow ard him w ith a reassu rin g smile.
“If M aud w an ts to be a duchess, I ’ll give her the
place and you can fix up th e title fo r her. I ’ve got no
sons, anyw ay. B ut, as fo r me. N ix!”
“B ut,” continued M ary, “m y sister can be m ore th an
a duchess. My sister-in-law . the lady Eileen, m arried a
prince of the royal blood. W hy shouldn’t M aud?”
“W ho’s stopping h e r? ” shouted Price. “N ot me! If
she w ants to be a princess, 111 m ake her a princess.
D am n it! I ’ll m ake her a queen, if she w ants. H er blood’s
as blue as any queen’s, and as red as any heroine’s. She
not only looks a queen, b u t she is a queen in character,
14—
culture, chivalry, or any o ther royal prerogative. If she
w an ts a crow n to w ear on her glorious brow n head, I’ll
give it her, dam n it! B u t so fa r as I see, she’s satisfied
to be plain M aud M orning, or change it to M rs. Fidus.”
“W hat, m arry a Je w ? ” cried the Duchess.
“W hat’s the m a tte r w ith a Je w ? ” snapped M orning.
“W eren’t B eaconsfield and R eading Jew s? Didn’t Rose-
berry m arry a Jew ess? A ren’t som e of m y business as­
sociates Jew s? W ithout th eir brains and co-operation
would I be w h at I am tod ay ? W ould your king he on
his throne? N one of th a t anti-Sem itic bunk for me,
dam n it! I ’m a free-horn A m erican and see no difference
betw een Jew and Gentile. A s to Paul, he’s the straig h t-
est shooter I ’ve m et in m y long life, and I ’ve m et every
body.”
And so P rice rem ained plain Mr. M orning, and the
new spaper stories inspired by the D uchess of Albion had
not yet succeeded in buying the throne of the B ritish E m ­
pire for the H ouse of M orning.
R othkopf, a self-constituted suitor, tried perhaps
m ore strenuously th an the others to divine the g reat
plu to crat’s thoughts. Im pecunious relatively, am bitious,
capable, th e leader of one of the stro n g est p arties in
A m erica, he lacked only M orning’s billions to force the
doors of the W hite House. As one of M orning’s lobbyists
he w as already in his pay directly and indirectly through
the inside inform ation th a t enabled him to speculate suc­
cessfully in th e franchises th a t system atically fell to the
lot of M orning. B u t M orning, an exact judge of m en and
in accordance w ith the policy of all em ployers, did not
intend to place his employee in a position w here he could
a ct on his own initiative, perhaps exact excessive em olu­
m ent or refuse behests. M orning had sufficient sense
to understand th a t m en who can be bought have th eir
price. He had discovered th a t m ost m en w ere loyal to
him because he paid the highest price or because they
knew th a t he could pay the highest price. H e used them ,
h u t he did not im plicitly tru s t them , th a t is, he never m ade
any m an his confidant. As for R othkopf, he m istrusted
him . B ut the ten million B eerbibbers, m ostly G erm an-
A m ericans, who fought through conviction for beer, w ere
a factor he had to consider in his financial operations.
These considerations m ade the leader of the Beerbibbers
a frequent guest a t the M orning m ansion and prevented
M aud from show ing any discourtesy to the pow erful
senator.
P atrick Pilligin, large, blubbery, blue-eyed Irish-
A m erican, dispenser and p a rta k e r of g raft, fixer of
judges and juries, senator and lobbyist, also in the pay
of M orning, but an inveterate foe of E ngland and fath er
of a num erous fam ily, pondered the old p lu to crat’s as­
severations not m atrim onially, and not exactly venally.
M orning had no son, if the H ouse of M orning w as to be
perpetuated, it would have to be through his daughter
M aud. She w as the only person in th e w orld in her
fa th e r’s confidence, he discussed every move in his
stupendous operations w ith her, asked h er advice, fol­
lowed it w hen she could convince him th a t she w as right,
or ignored it, w hen he could convince h er th a t she w as
w rong. I t w as generally understood th a t M aud would
head the H ouse of M orning w hen th e old m an died.
H itherto h er republicanism and patriotism , her sisterly
affection for P aul whose fa th e r had been one of M orn­
ing’s closest associates, had been im pregnable. B u t if
perchance the glam or of a throne should cast its toils
around her, the bonds betw een A nglican E ngland and
P ro te sta n t A m erica, royal E ngland and royalist A m erica,
would be inseparably cem ented and invincibly fortified.
In addition to his num erous other dignities, Pilligin w as
th e head of the Irish-A m erican League th a t w ished to
sever the only rem aining link betw een E ngland and Ire ­
land, and the proud possessor of a Catholic order in recog­
nition of his leadership of A m erican C atholics in th eir
political aspirations. M orning’s w ords m ight have an
ominous significance to the bulky Irish-A m erican C ath­
olic.
Paul, Jew by b irth b u t P an th eist by conviction, au ­
th o r and social-reform er, philanthropist, feeding the
hungry, clothing the naked, healing the sick, teaching the
ignorant, w ith m oney M aud forced upon him , as quickly
as M orning handed it over under the p retex t of being
dividends accruing from Fidus’ stocks, had grow n up as
stated w ith M aud; as little children they had slept in one
bed, as b ro th er and sister th ey had trudged to school to ­
g eth er w ith th eir arm s around each other, as co-eds th eir
lips had often m et in a holy kiss. T hen one day they
had aw akened to the startlin g revelation th a t they w ere
m an and w om an, and P aul had never em braced h er since.
M aud, divining th e re stra in t before P au l had defined it
to him self, had w ished to prevent it. H er brow n eyes had
looked ever since into his black eyes w ith longing, she
w anted to press h er lips to his again, hold him in her
arm s, b u t she knew th a t his re stra in t w as reverence,
th a t he had elevated her to a pedestal of adoration, in­
spiration, and she w ith her w om anly intuition had told
herself th a t she m ust rem ain w h at he had m ade her.
N ow w hen h er fa th e r so forcibly gave utteran ce to
his anglophilia, her eyes had sunk in em barrassm ent, but
raising' them furtively she had caught the questioning,
ard en t look in P a u l’s sad eyes, and in a m om ent she w as
a t his side, her trem bling hands clasping his reassuringly.
If th is incident had not taken place on the balcony ex­
posed to the view of thousands, her arm s, th en and there,
would have encircled his neck and her lips would have
sought his in passionate recom pense.
As they stood thus, each absorbed in his own
tho u g h ts and feelings, th eir vision w as suddenly directed
skyw ards. A fleet of six air-ships and about a hundred
atten d en t airplanes w as approaching. A t the tim e of
w hich I w rite the noise of air-m otors had been elim inated.
They had, therefore, received no w arning, and the scout
flyers w ere directly over th eir heads before th eir a tte n ­
tion w as diverted from the procession. M ajestically, like
creatu res of flesh and blood, they sailed through the azure
sky, reflecting the sun’s rays in a sheen of silver varie­
gated w ith the banners and stream ers of all nations.
The beauty of the whole scene w as inspiring; on the
earth the stately buildings of stone in th e ir settings of
green, the long vistas of the avenues lined w ith venerable
trees, shading the gaily-clad spectators, th e balconies and
w indow s garlanded, festooned w ith ribbons, oak leaves,
rich cloths; and th eir sabled occupants; the glitterin g
procession, prancing steeds, craw ling tanks, ponderous
cannon, airy cyclists; the clash and harm ony of the
bands; in the sky the m an-m ade birds, sym bols of m an’s
victory over the atm osphere and prom ises of his conquest
of in terstellar space.
A t a signal th e procession halted, th e air-ships a r­
rested th eir flight, the airplanes gyrated each in a n a r­
row circle, those in the service of the nation raised th eir
hands in salute, private citizens bared th eir heads, the
boom of a cannon w as heard in the sky and a t th e sam e
in stan t a hundred hands and a million voices caused the
a ir to reverberate w ith the glorious strain s of The S ta r
Spangled B anner. N ever before had such a volum e of
m usic risen to heaven. The sentim ent of the m om ent
w as overpow ering, horses and m en quivered w ith em o­
tion, th e h earts of m any stopped beating, and w om en sank
to the earth in hysterical swoon.
D uring these tense m om ents, one of th e airplanes,
unobserved by the v ast m ultitude on the ground, seem ed
to be unable to continue its g y ratin g evolution, it dived
rapidly down and forw ard, and as it passed over the spot
w here the P resident stood bareheaded surrounded by
secret-service agents, an object cam ouflaged alm ost to
invisibility dropped from the fusilage. A second a fte r
there w as a puff of blue smoke, a dull detonation, and
before th e thro n g had realized fully w h at had happened,
the airplane had disappeared.
W hile the voices still resounded in thrilling accents,
hoarse cries began to rend the skies, th e people stepped
from the sidew alks and crowded upon the procession,
thousands w ere crushed and then tram pled beneath
fran tic persons and galloping horses. The shrill w histle
of policemen, the horns of am bulances scurrying h ith er
and th ith er to succor the iniured, rose above the national
anthem which, as the panic spread along the line, died
aw ay uncom pleted.
And then, in place of the glorious strain s of the song
of victory, th e revulsive w ail of grief and calam ity:
“The P resident is dead!”
A cordon of police surrounded the bloody spot w here
th e fragm ents of the P resident and his atten d an ts
strew ed the ground. W hen the doctors and th e officers,
m ilitary and civil, finally and reluctantly adm itted to
each o ther th a t th e chief executive had been prem edi-
tated ly assassinated by an aerial bomb, and signalled th e
a ir-craft above, the assassin had long disappered in the
direction of the A tlantic Ocean.

CHAPTER 3
Radio, television, rad ar, jet- and rocket-planes, heli­
copters, zeppelins, the la te st and m ost m arvelous inven­
tions of m an were im pressed to discover the p erp etrato r
of the d astardly crim e. E very plane on earth and in the
sky, ever pilot, every hum an being who m ight be able to
handle a flying m achine, in A m erica and in every other
land, or on the w ide w aters, w as investigated. A m erica
dem anded it, and she had the pow er to enforce her de­
m ands—pow er perhaps not actual b u t since the W orld
W ars sufficiently potential in th e im aginations of the
nations of the earth to m ake her w ord law. N o one
doubted h er power, th e pow er of the atom bomb, as no
one had doubted the com bined pow er of G erm any, A ustria
and Ita ly before A rm ageddon.
B ut probing and scouring as she did, coercion and re ­
w ard failed to discover the slightest clue. P erhaps the
assassin had been engulfed by the oceans, incinerated by
avenging flam es, w recked in an arid or icy desert, or am id
inaccessible peaks, gone, the devout hoped, w ith his secret
to pay the penalty before a spiritual judge.
O r he w as being sheltered by his friends, enem ies of
th e Republic—or of the President. Enem ies of the R e­
public there w ere m any: every country in the debt of the
U nited S tates, every country envious of her w ealth and
pow er, every country rival for w orld-trade, every country
th a t feared her or hated her, because th eir nationals had
been kep t out by im m igration or quota law s; individual
enemies, m en who had been deported, w om en w ho had
been debarred for “m oral tu rp itu d e”, persons whose pelf
or prerogatives had vanished before the A m erican legions.
T hen the enem ies intern al and external of the President,
anarchists, com m unists, lunatics, poltitical opponents,
m en and women who had been ousted from “jobs”, whose
avenues to g ra ft had been closed by th e inevitable shake-
up th a t inaugurates a new president.
These enemies, the usual enem ies of those in position,
w ere known, but as no one in particu lar jould be identi­
fied, the press, the police, the public in stitu ted a futile
exam ination of motives.
To w ind up, the com m ander of the a ir squadron w as
courtm artialled. No one knew w hen or how the stran g e
airc ra ft had joined the squadron. W hile it had vanished
nothing to differentiate it from the other units had been
rem arked. The only conclusion: There m ust have been
a tra ito r in the airforces, and the com m ander w as de­
m oted. E xcuse: A t least he should have know n of the
stra n g e r’s presence m his fleet.
E agle w as not th e firs t president to be assassinated,
and no one believed he would be th e last. A ttem p ts on
the lives of every president have probably been en ter­
tained, and deterred or fru stra te d by th e secret service.
W hat a com m entary on our so-called civilization, or shall
we say hum an beings! The g reatest of the presidents
had m et a violent death. This fa c t w as recalled b u t no
one rem em bered the w ords of th a t president:
“As a result of the w ar, corporations have been
enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will
follow and the m oney pow er of the country will endeavor
to prolong its reign hy w orking upon the prejudices of
th e people until all w ealth is aggregated in a few hands,
and the republic is destroyed.”
The gloom th a t settled on the republic w as caused
by the grief a t the senseless death of its chief m agistrate,
it w as not a foreboding of im pending doom. Jazz w ent
on despite the w arnings of augurs who drew th eir con­
clusions from the flights of the birds of science. Palaces
of am usem ent rose higher into the air, dazzling w ith their
brilliance, dazing w ith th eir shows of naked lacivious-
ness. Men grew rich and pow erful through bootlegging
or blackm arketing. G irls disappeared and w ere never
heard of again unless som etim es th eir m utilated bodies
w ere flaunted along autom obile highw ays. Children w ere
held fo r ransom , and failing paym ent, callously clubbed.
The stock exchange m ade and broke billionaires a t the
expense of the nation. G raft perm eated all the profes­
sions, the judiciary, the legislature. Y et no one, except
th e augurs,' thought th a t all pleasure, luxury, enjoym ent;
vice, hypocricsv, falsehood; crim e, corruption, dishonesty
m ust be paid for sooner or later. And the longer the
day of reckoning is delayed, the g reater the price.
These conditions had been general since the W orld
W ars, in fa c t th e adult population had grow n up am id
them and knew no other. Only the old m en and women,
those who had reached adolescense before the A rm istice,
rem em bered any o ther conditions, and they of course
w ere out-of-date. The students of history w ere m ere
theorists, dream ers, visionaries.
I t w as under these conditions th a t the presidency
autom atically devolved upon the vice-president, H enry
H olland. Probably the highest office in the land would
never have been attain ed through th e electoral college by
th is independent character. H e had been elected to the
vice-presidency not for political reasons but because of
an adventurous career th a t had m ade him th e people’s
idol. As a young' m an he had rocket-planed solo around
the world, east and w est, n o rth and south, eclipsing the
renow n of L indbergh whose m em ory had already alm ost
faded into fable. The populace require contactual heroes
to aw aken th eir enthusiasm . N am es as centrifugal rip ­
ples tend to lose th eir potency, only w here the stone is
flung are the boats rocked.
Of m edium height, healthy, w iry, courageous, silent,
m odest, deliberate, he had never been suspected of any
ability as a statesm an and leader. H is friends rushed
to advise, to prevent w reck to the ship of state. The
v irtu al m asters of the land brought docum ents for u rg en t
signature w hich how ever w ere held over for consider­
ation. The press surm ised and prognosticated. The peo­
ple w ere satisfied th a t everything would come out all
right.
H olland listened atten tiv ely to advice, some he took,
som e he ignored. H e read all docum ents, some he signed,
som e he vetoed. H e m et all protests w ith the quiet re ­
m ark: “I have alw ays acted as m y own pilot.”
This n atu rally did not fall in w ith the views of the
m asters of th e land. O ften they gathered in conclave
to devise controls on the “pilot.” B ut despite the fa c t th a t
th ey controlled the political m achinery and the m oney
power, they w ere not able to prevent H olland’s re-election
a fte r his first short term . All they w ere able to com pass
w as the election of Mr. S tout to the vice-presidency.
If H olland had not chosen to respect the precedent
and law th a t a chief m ag istrate should not run for three
term s, there is no doubt th a t he w ould have been re­
elected. B u t he chose to throw in his support to Stout.
Only a fte r he discovered S to u t’s disloyalty to him self did
he reg ret his decision. Then it w as too late, and inad­
visedly he w as persuaded to found a third party, which
m ay rob one or other of the old p arties but never elect
its own candidate.
A t the tim e of w hich I w rite, p a rty lines w ere not
sharply dem arcated, they had followed in the w ake of
E nglish politics, become opportunist as A m erican politics»
w ere bound to become. The Solid South often voted re ­
publican; the N orth, dem ocratic. C andidates sw itched
w ithout hum iliation or reproach. In addition to the tw o
m ain parties, there w ere the Beerbibbers, the Irish-
A m ericans, th e Socialists, and the R eform ers led by Fidus.
So w hen H olland stam peded and launched the Independ­
ents, not his action b u t his chances were w eighed by
opponents.
This is w h at engaged the m inds of m any m en g a th e r­
ed a t a reception in the M orning m ansion.
“H olland doesn’t stan d a ghost of a chance, now th a t
you’ve been nom inated,” M orning reiterated.
“B ut he’ll pull a bunch of votes,” stated S tout som e­
w h at gloomily.
“T h at’s to be expected, b u t th a t w on’t change the
outcom e. You’ll be president, and we m ight as w ell de­
cide definitely on a cabinet.”
“T here’s R othkopf, Pilligin and Fidus.”
“N one of them any good,” snapped th e ponderous
plutocrat.
“B ut look a t the votes they control. T heir follow ers
m ight decide the election.”
“They m ight if w e’d let ’em. R othkopf is g ettin g too
strong. T h at’s w hy I w ouldn’t back him for the vice­
presidency. A t h e a rt he’s a G erm an and a royalist. H e’d
like to see England, F rance, and Ita ly destroyed, or a t
least disrupted, for conquering th e F atherland, and th a t’s
the w ay he and the B eerbibbers would vote.”
— 16—
“If th a t’s th e case, w hy w ouldn’t he have it in fo r
u s ? ”
“H e has, and th a t’s an other reason I don’t tru s t him .”
“B ut his vote m ight offset the vote of the Irish-
A m ericans in case they go dem ocratic,” S tout continued
to argue.
“W hat m akes you th in k th ey ’ll vote dem ocratic ?”
“N ew Y ork and Chicago have voted dem ocratic be­
fore and they m ight do it again, if we don’t w in over
Pilligin. W hat’s the m a tte r w ith P illig in ?”
“N othing except he’s anti-B ritish, and I can’t afford
to have an enem y of E ngland in the cabinet.”
“H e couldn’t do m uch harm ,” said S to u t placatingly.
“T here’s fam ily and financial reasons,” replied M orn­
ing, finality in his voice.
“Then there’s only Fidus left.”
“Leave him out. H e’s all rig h t personally, and he’s a
protege of the fam ily. B ut he’ll never go back on the
R eform P arty , and no reform er w ill ever vote republi­
can, or for the m a tte r of th a t, dem ocratic. They w an t a
U nited S tates of the E arth . E ven if he voted w ith us
in the cabinet, he couldn’t bring us any votes in the
election. B ut he’ll vote only as his conscience dictates.
Then they m ight bring up his Jew ish background. If it
w asn’t for th a t I m ight have even ru n him for the
presidency.”
There w as a long pause during w hich the hum of a
phonofilm w as borne to the ears of the tw o m en in th eir
arbor. S tout spoke again:
“I suppose th en we can’t count on any votes from
R othkopf and P illig in ?”
“W e’ll g et all the votes th ey control,” replied M orn­
ing em phatically; r‘if we don’t, I ’ll drop ’em both cold,
th ey ’ll starv e.”
“B ut th ey ’ve both got money, and th eir adherents
could raise enough for them to m ake them independent
of you.”
“T h at’s so ? ” sneered th e financier. “All they’ve got
is invested in stock I control. If I like, I can break ’em.
Then I ’ve got the goods on ’em in so m any crooked deals
th ey ’ve pulled th a t they w ouldn’t dare to go back on me,
even if they could raise the dough.”
S to u t knew th is only too well, and could not help
th inking th a t he him self enjoyed no m ore independence
th a n th e tw o m en m entioned. W hile M orning’s th re a ts
w ere n o t u ttered insinuatingly, S tout drew the conclusion
th a t w hoever dared cross the p o tentate w ould m eet w ith
a sim ilar fate. Y et H olland had defied him.
Close to the tw o m en but hidden behind a group of
th ick shrubbery stood R othkopf, an appliance for am ­
plifying sound w aves held to his ear. So in ten t w as he
on his own act of eavesdropping th a t he failed to notice
th a t he him self w as being w atched. He should have
know n th a t a m an in M orning’s position would never ap­
p ear in public w ithout a retinue of detectives. P erhaps
he did know, but took a chance. A s he moved rapidly
aw ay, disturbed by approaching footsteps, he w as follow­
ed by a footm an who w atched him approach M aud M orn­
ing, and then suddenly disappeared.
“W hat is the la te st political news, Mr. R oth k o p f?”
enquired M aud pleasantly, as the G erm an-A m erican drew
near.
“I m ust ask you, M iss M orning. W hatever I know
would be stale to you.”
“I’ve heard the B eerbibbers dem and the Secretary-of-
S tateship as the price of th eir vote.”
The color m ounted to th e roots of R othkopf’s short-
cropped red hair. N o doubt th is rem ark had been m ade
designedly. W as the conversation to w hich he had been
an eavesdropper also m ade for his ears, and w ere fath er
and daughter in league?
“There w as som e ta lk about it, M iss M orning, by a
few irresponsible w ard bosses, b u t I knocked th e idea
out of th eir heads. I told them I didn’t w an t the job. I
could do m ore for them by retain in g m y freedom .”
“W asn’t th a t too unselfish of y o u ?” she enquired
suavely.
He ignored the sarcasm and flung out his own hint:
“B ut I’m afraid, Miss M orning, the B eerbibbers are
g ettin g out of hand. They dem and som e voice in the
governm ent, and some of them have openly threatened
to vote as they please. I am doing everything I can to
hold them in line, b u t I ’m afraid w e’ll lose a num ber of
votes unless som ething is done to appease them .”
The point did not pass over M aud’s head, b u t she
asked innocently: “How will they vote, Mr. R oth k o p f?”
“M any will vote socialist, as they have alw ays done;
others favor the dem ocratic candidate, and his disarm ­
am ent plan; then H olland still has the allegiance of m any
w hom he favored. I t will be hard to prevent those votes
going to him . T hey’re bought and paid for.”
“Is there no w ay to prevent th is d isin teg ratio n ?” A
m ore serious inflection cam e into h er voice. H e could not
fail to notice it.
“M any no doubt could be bought over from th eir
convictions, could be won by higher bids. B ut it will
cost a t least a hundred m illion,” he added nonchalantly,
“and if the m achinery is not oiled by experienced hands,
th e effort will fail of its purpose.”
“T h at m eans, Mr. R othkopf,” she said candidly,
“th a t unless a hundred million dollars of the cam paign
fund are entrusted to you for distribution, the B eerbib­
bers m ay prevent the election of S to u t? ”
“I did not say th a t,” he hastened to assert, “nor did
I h in t it. In fact I should m uch prefer th a t others carry
on the negotiations. Since I declined to be p u t forw ard
as a candidate fo r the Secretary-of-S tateship, m y in­
fluence and au thority have w aned. A s I cannot g u aran ­
tee results, I w ish to avoid blam e.”
W as he m aking a fran k confession, or had he already
arranged revenge for defeat. T ru th w as not one of his
virtues, b u t if he w as telling the tru th , it w ould be neces­
sary to w eigh very carefully to whom they should en tru st
th a t p a rt of the cam paign funds assigned to the B eer
bibbers
The conversation had tak en a tu rn th a t one of the
speakers would have wished to avoid. H e would have
preferred to lead the talk into other channels, fa r from
politics. B ut he judged the occasion unpropitious, and
fearin g to en tru st him self fu rth e r to th e subtle cross-ex­
am ination of this w om an, he abruptly excused him self on
th e plea of an im p o rtan t conference.
A n elevator took him to the roof of th e m ansion
w here a few m inutes later, in answ er to his pocket-radio
signal, an avis swooped down and picked him up. The
avis, a com pact com bination of boat, auto, plane and
helicopter, w as not y et in general use. In fact this w as
th e only one in A m erica, being the p roperty of the G er­
m an am bassador, C ount F euerstab. R esem bling a flying
fish, w ith folding pectoral planes, propellers above and
in front, it w as equajly m otile for air, land, sea and
undersea.
The depressing w hirl of the helicopter, th a t n eu tral­
ized the buoyancy of the helium com partm ents, being
reversed and exerting a raisin g force, th e avis shot up
vertically for som e distance; then th e planes opened
from the sides, and the avis shot forw ard in th e direction
of W ashington. The tw o hundred odd m iles via P h ila­
delphia w ere traversed in less th an an hour, and the avis
then dropped like a haw k to th e roof of the G erm an em ­
bassy.
C ount F eu erstab ’s fa th e r had served the last kaiser
loyally. F o r th a t reason and because of his own pro­
nounced junkerism , the m ost im p o rtan t am bassadorship
of th e reich had been conferred upon him . W e say reich;
for to all G erm ans except th e m inority social-dem ocrats
th e F ath erlan d w as still das R eich; though a republic to
w hich a royalist had been elected president. T itles of
nobility and m ilitary ran k s w ere still conferred and as
highly esteem ed as they had ever been. E ngland could
hardly consistenly object to the continued fostering of
th e royalist tradition.
Stout, tall, of m ilitary bearing; blond, w ith fierce
m oustache and short-cropped hair, a scar across his cheek
(the evidence of a duel), he w as typical of his caste. H is
voice w hen he spoke G erm an had the intonation of
h au g h ty command.
“W hat are his plans ?” he enquired referrin g to P rice
M orning.
“I had no tim e, Excellency, to discuss them w ith him.
A fter a form al g reeting he w ithdrew w ith Stout, but I
heard sufficient to know w h at he has in m ind.” And
then he recounted in detail the conversation betw een
M orning and Stout, and betw een Miss M orning and him ­
self.
“I t would then not be advisable to vote fo r S tout.”
— 17-
“No, Excellency.”
“W hat about H olland?”
“I t 'would be a w aste of votes, Excellency. I believe
the tw o republican candidates w ill split the votes, and
th a t H ighland, the dem ocratic candidate, will be elected.
W e m ight as w ell give him our votes fo r a price.”
“W hat w ill he do for u s ? ”
“H e w ill observe stric t n eu trality in case we declare
w ar. T h at w ill enable us to im port foodstuffs, and of
course M orning will not refuse to sell us am m unition.
W hen we have settled our score w ith Italy for her treason
to us, we can tu rn on F rance and reconquer the lost
provinces. A m erica w ill not enter another E uropean w ar
if w e pretend friendship for Belgium and G reat B ritain,
and show th a t our ultim ate objective is R ussia; and R ussia
will not a tta c k us if we do not go E ast. R ussia knows
th a t any move in our direction w ill bring the atom bomb
on h er head. Of course we m ust not a tta c k F rance, we
m ust w ait to be attacked; neither E ngland nor R ussia will
p erm it F rance to overrun G erm any. M orning will be
glad to sell am m unition to anybody provided E ngland is
n o t m olested.”
“W ill H ighland do anything for you personally?”
“He would, Excellency, b u t I th in k it advisable to
rem ain in the background. I m ight let it appear publicly
th a t I am in favor of Stout. B ut anyw ay, if H ighland is
elected, M orning m ay ruin me financially. I hope, Ex-
cellecy, th e F ath erlan d will pro tect me. I am m aking a
sacrifice.”
“Yes, R othhopf, yes I know. You will be protected.
B ut it is necessary th a t you continue in prom inence. The
day m ay come w hen it will be necessary for you to take
the helm in th is country, so th a t the w orld-destiny of the
F ath erlan d m ay be fulfilled. There is still some senti­
m ent in this country fo r France, though the actions of
Italy , her com m unist elem ents, have alienated sym pathy.
The financiers who have loaned Italy m oney will criticize
our ju st w ar, and even M orning w ill pro tect his Italian
son-in-law and his estate (we can give him assurances as
to th a t ! ; but the A m erican people w ill rem ain indiffer­
ent. W e cannot depend on the w ill of one m an not to
intervene in our im broglio w ith F rance. We m ust have
th e A m erican w orkingm an on our side. If necessary a
general strik e m ust be engineered. T here m ust be no
m unitions fo r our enemies. In fa c t it is desirable th a t
there be no m unitions a t all in the U nited S tates. In
th a t connection we can go along w ith Russia. Mr. H igh­
land m ust be forced to advocate universal peace, to tal
disarm am ent, no arm y, no navy, no air fleet, the destruc­
tion of the atom bomb. W e can easily convince A m erica
th a t the stro n g er we are, the less need for A m erican
p reparations for w ar. We m ust never fo rg et th a t if it
had not been for the U nited S tates we w ould already have
been m asters of the w orld as our K ultur destines us to
be. O ur m erchant boats though sm all and unarm ed and
our trad e zeppelins, furnished w ith our secret w eapons,
could easily bring the decadent B ritish E m pire to an end.
and then we shall be face to face w ith the U nited States,
w ith the w hole of L atin A m erica on our side. In antici­
pation of th a t day w e m ust see th a t th is country has no
soldiers, nor weapons, th a t the w orkingm an follow our
leaders. D uring all th is tim e of preparation we shall
pretend friendship for R ussia and h er satellites, b u t as
soon as we have em asculated the U nited States, we shall
open our D rive to the E ast.
“I t is necessary, R othkopf, th a t you retain your in­
fluence not only over th e Beerbibbers, b u t over all the
w orkingm en’s organizations, if for no o ther reason th an
to keep an eye on the com m unist infiltration; you m ust
keep up relations w ith the Irish who h ate E ngland, w ith
the pacifists or U nited-S tates-of-the-E arth propagandists,
the R eform ers, led by th a t Jew, Fidus.”
“Pilligin and Fidus are m y friends, Excellency,” said
R othkopf apparently w ith pride. “If Fidus cared, he
m ight even be president. The people love him .”
“Yes, I know you have some influence w ith them ,
b u t w h at relations have you w ith th e comm on laboring
classes?”
R othkopf hesitated. He w as a m em ber of the G er­
m an secret service, and had taken the oath of allegiance
to th e G erm an reich, but a t the sam e tim e he w as selfish.
So long as the in terests of the F atherland coincided w ith
his own am bitions, he w ould obey th e com m ands of th e
am bassador im plicitly, b u t if he w as to be used as a cats-
paw, his own interests would be param ount. G erm any’s
pow er in A m erica w as not as ruthless as th a t of Russia,
and if necessary A m erica would protect him ag ain st per­
sonal violence. Finally he replied:
“There is O ysterlinni, Excellency. He is a Sicilyan,
head of the B lackhand. He rules practically all the gun­
m en of A m erica. He controls the dope, bootlegging,
gam bling, sm uggling, and w hite-slave traffic. H is gun­
m en are hired to sw ing elections, his bom bing squads
are used by th e unions to intim idate scabs or to force the
hands of the em ployers. He m aintains a fleet of a ir­
planes, trucks, speed-boats, and from his fastness in
Mexico rules like a king. H e has the pow er to drive the
laboring classes. He can be bought, Excellency.”
“A rem arkable m an, a rem arkable m an,” reiterated
the am bassador; “but will he not sym pathize w ith
Ita ly ? ”
“He has no country, Excellency. He is an outlaw ,
tolerated in Mexico and some other C entral A m erican
S tates only because he is able to pay.”
“Doesn’t the U nited S tates know of his stronghold?”
enquired the am bassador pensively.
“No, Excellency. H e never stays long in one place
or in any S tate. W henever a search is made, he cannot
be found, he has been shot or poisoned. W hile his exist­
ence is know n to the world, his re tre a t is know n only to a
few tru sted lieutenants.”
“How did you learn of it, R o th k o p f?” asked the am ­
bassador pointedly.
“I don’t know w here he is. I know only one of his
agents. He supplies the B eerbibbers’ tu m h alls w ith beer,
Excellency.”
H e sm iled broadly and the am bassador laughed.
CHAPTER 4
I have referred to the B ritish E m pire as if it still
w ere intact, b u t as a m a tte r of fa c t it w as already fast
descending to its nadir. Shorn of India, it still retained
g re a t financial pow er there by playing off the P ark istan
M oslems ag ain st H industan. D eprived of E gypt, from
w hich she w ithdrew w ith less hum iliation since India had
been given self-rule, she still retained th e Sudan and
outposts across the Red Sea. B ut as explained, E ngland
and her aristocracy w as buttressed by the A m erican
dollar ag ain st the socialist politicians w ith th eir pro-
R ussian intrigues.
Italy had become practically a satellite of the R us­
sian bear, and fo r th a t reason the U nited S tates had per­
m itted G erm any to secretly rearm , and serve as a buffer
ag ainst fu rth e r R ussian expansion. I t w as this repetition
of history th a t enabled G erm any to en tertain designs
ag ain st Italy, probably w ith the backing of A m erican
capitalists. The real objective w as however, not Italy
b u t Russia, via Greece, A ustria, H ungary, and the other
countries w ithin the Soviet sphere.
T w enty million m en w ere under arm s, costing the
— 18
w orld th irty billion dollars a year. R ussia had the larg est
arm y, then cam e China w ith her interm inable civil w ar,
and in third place came the U nited States.
R ussia and the U. S. w ere w atching each o ther as
cat and mouse, A m erica backing Greece and T urkey in
E astern Europe, China and a re-trained though not re ­
arm ed Jap an in Asia, to keep R ussia w orried. W hile
A m erica publicly declared h er intention to keep out of the
quarrel betw een G erm any and Italy, and R ussia dared not
disclose any designs on Italian territo ry , G erm any could
defy the UN w hile it w rangled about the dispute, be­
cause secretly A m erica had given G erm any the green
light. Of course A m erica had the atom ic bomb, and
th a t w as the principal d eterran t to R ussia, even if she
had the bomb herself. Surrounded by G erm any, Greece,
T urkey, C hina and Japan, from w hich atom ic carriers
could operate, R ussia w as a t a disadvantage as com pared
w ith the U nited S tates w hich had no adjacent countries
open as bases for R ussian carriers. R ussia’s v ast m an­
pow er could reach her neighbors but not A m erica.
W ars are supposed to be in stigated fo r selfish ends,
by rulers, politicians, capitalists. I t has been argued th a t
th e people never desire w ar and w ould never m ake w ar
of th eir own accord. No doubt in m any cases this is true.
B u t there are exceptions to every generality. There are
very few universal tru th s. E verything is relative.
W hile it is tru e th a t G erm any’s rulers could have
averted w ar, it is also an incontrovertible fact th a t the
G erm an nation enlisted w illingly in the w ar against Italy.
Ita ly had betrayed them , through this b etrayal th ey had
been deprived of territo ry , m any G erm ans had been m ade
subject to foreign rule, the em pire had been hum bled and
im poverished. A ccordingly governm ent and nation shared
the responsibility for this w ar.
W hen G erm any invaded Belgium and attack ed
F rance in 1914 there w as no m oral excuse, a t least not in
th e eyes of the civilized w orld; b u t w hen th e G erm an
cabinet invented a p retex t for declaring w ar on Italy,
th ere w ere very few people in G erm any not convinced
th a t they had adequate justification. The world, how ­
ever, had to be conciliated. A m ere w ar of retaliatio n
would have been unjustifiable in the eyes of the world,
though the w orld had nothing to say in the m atter.
The p retex t w as readily available. G erm ans in Ita ly
had grow n m ore h aughty as the com m ercial pow er of
G erm any grew . A ccording to G erm an press agents,
m any G erm ans seem ed to be discrim inated against, to be
persecuted, and even oppressed by com m unist laws. Sharp
notes w ere exchanged, until a t last G erm any threatened
to send an air dem onstration to p ro tect the G erm ans
living in Italy. N atu rally Italy resented this, and asked
th e pow ers to intervene. A riot w as organized by agents
provocateurs, in Which several G erm ans w ere killed by
com m unists. W ithout w aiting fo r an investigation, the
G erm an air sally such as it w as flew over the Alps.
G erm any w as supposed to have only com m ercial
planes, but any plane can carry a bomb, radioactive
substances, or bacteria. G erm any supposedly had no w ar
m aterial, no arm s. All m eans of m aking w ar had been
restricted by the term s of the peace a fte r the G reat W ars.
B u t G erm any had built up a m oderate com m ercial air
fleet, and a not negligible chem ical industry, under the
Allied inspectorship. A ll th a t w as necessary w as for her
pilots to drop sm oke bom bs from the air, and in a few
days Rome w as deserted. B ut th a t did not m ean th a t
Ita ly w as subjugated. Ita ly had been insolently p rep ar­
ing fo r ju st such an em ergency, aided by Russia. B ut in
spite of these precautions, she w as fa r behind G erm any,
and in a few days m ost of the vulnerable spots becam e
cellar cities, even though there had not been a single
casualty.
G erm any’s schrecklichkeit tactis enabled her to in­
tim idate, b u t not to m ake conquests. B u t soon an arm y
w as mobilized though inadequately equipped, and on the
m arch. This m eant a p ro tracted cam paign.
A s soon as G erm any declared w ar, she tore up the
peace tre a ty and converted all her industries to the m an­
u facture of w ar m aterial. This w as not difficult as the
m ost detailed plans had been form ulated and hidden for
years, and every individual of the nation w as ready and
prepared to tak e up his m ilitary duties. Who w as to stop
her ? The arm ies of occupation had been w ithdraw n, and
only inspectors had seen the principal cities for m onths.
F rance protested m ore strenuously th an any other
pow er, but no one w anted another W orld W ar. And
G erm any asseverated th a t she had no designs on France,
and th a t com m unist Ita ly w as as m uch an enem y of
F rance as she w as of G erm any—w hich seem ed to be
borne out by facts. All th is enabled G erm any to retu rn
to h er m ilitaristic career. I t w as only necessary to place
arm s in the hands of the nation—every m an had been
drilled for m onths as efficiently, in fa c t m ore efficiently,
th a n the best arm ies in existence.
P resident H ighland declared a stric t n eu trality of
the U nited S tates. T hat m eant th a t she w as able to
furnish all the supplies she could to either of the bel­
ligerents. N atu rally the g reater p a rt w ent to G erm any.
F irstly and m ost im portant G erm any had the w herew ithal
to pay; then m irable dictu a G erm an subm arine appeared
a t the entrance of th e S tra its of G ibraltar and threatened
to sink all contraband destined for Italy . Thus very
little contraband entered th e Ita lia n ports. This
n atu rally riled Ita ly despite the fa c t th a t contraband
reached her in no negligble quantities across France,
Spain and P ortugal. In retaliatio n she sank a ship in the
M editerranean carrying contraband, and h er air c ra ft
often ventured across the continent to bom b G erm an ship­
ping.
W ith the G erm an arm y in A ustria, G erm any’s pres­
tige im m ediately reacted on the E astern E uropean states
w hich had been chafing under the dom ineering arrogance
of R ussia. H er strag g lin g convoys of a ir ships and sub­
m arines w hich protected G erm an shipping in the M edi­
terran ean , finally established subm arine bases in T urkey
and Greece, w ith th e collusion of A m erica and E ngland,
and thus G erm any w as able to obtain adequate supplies
also now from the E ast. T urkey especially w hich had
lost m uch through R ussia’s rise to pow er, openly sided
w ith G erm any in accordance w ith ancient tradition, and
Greece believed she could only benefit from Ita ly ’s defeat.
H ad not M ussolini attack ed Greece ?
B ut even w ithout these avenues of access and egress,
G erm any could not be isolated as she had been during the
G reat W ars. Flying had developed to such an extent th a t
both belligerents w ere able to obtain supplies from all the
four corners of the earth. The only obstacle to either
p a rty ’s tak in g advantage of th is progress in aviation w as
th e fact th a t G erm any had to concentrate a preponder­
ance of her lim ited a ir force in Italy, as her troops a t the
outset of hositilities w ere a t such a distance from Ita ly
and w ere not well enough equipped to m eet the enem y on
its own ground even if they could be transported, and
Ita ly had to keep practically her whole a ir force a t hom e
to m eet the enemy.
This m ust not be considered to have been a m ajo r
w ar. N either of the com batants had a real arm y or navy.
E verything w as m akeshift, and am used the re st of the
w orld. A s alw ays, th e w orld did not tak e th is flare-up
seriously, and everybody laughed and joked, egged them
on, and sold them supplies to continue the spectacle.
Thus the w ar dragged on in the a ir for alm ost a
year, until G erm any w as able to arm her troops, w hich
she of course did very secretly, then the g reat m arch
across A ustria w as begun, w ith benefit of w ar corre­
spondents. Aided by every G erm an in A ustria, and now
b e tte r equipped th an Italy, the first, second and third
lines of defense w ere successfully sm ashed, A ustria of­
ficially joined G erm any, and as a rew ard her borders
w ere again extended to th e A driatic and she w as safely
installed in T rieste w ith G erm an long-range guns and
subm arines to defend and extend her rights.
The pow ers thought G erm any had gone fa r enough,
and w hen Ita ly sued fo r peace, G erm any considered il
politic to m ake peace on favorable term s.
These events in Europe had brought only added
prosperity to A m erica. Loans to Italy w ere uncollectible,
Ita ly w as bankrupt, a nation of paupers, b u t they w ere
industrious and th rifty , so every Italian industry, and
th a t m eant p ractically all of them , th a t w as foreclosed
fo r a song by A m erican creditors, indirectly m ore th an
m ade good the loss in loans. G erm any doing everything
in h er pow er to placate th e U nited S tates raised no ob­
jection to Ita ly ’s being bloodsucked. In fa c t G erm any
had assured the U nited S tates a t the outbreak of hostili­
ties th a t she w ould be satisfied w ith th e suppression of
com m unism , and would let A m erica tak e the re st less
w h at w ent to A ustria, and som e trade treaties for h er­
self. A t the sam e tim e G erm any played a double gam e
w ith R ussia, assuring her th a t she w as anxious to get
A m erica out of E urope and would not object to R ussia
opening or closing the D ardanelles, provided G erm any
w as given trad e preferences in the N ear E ast. R ussia
probably w as not a dupe, b u t the im m ediate purpose of
G erm any to keep R ussia from inciting the B alkans to
fig h t G erm any, w as achieved for the tim e being.
On the o ther hand G erm any m ade protestations of
perpetual peace w ith the U nited S tates, pledged all G er­
m any’s regained and redoubled pow er to aid the U nited
S tates ag ain st R ussia. I t looked as if G erm any and the
U nited S tates w ere going to divide w orld-com m erce be­
tw een them , if R ussia could be elim inated.
E ngland alw ays w atchful and rem em bering her de­
pendence on tire U nited S tates during the W orld W ars
and still her debtor, feared th a t under som e unfavorable
circum stances pressure fo r repaym ent m ight be exerted.
She began to concentrate over a million veterans on the
fields of C anada, strateg ic railw ays w ere pushed to H ud­
— 19—
son B ay to feed steam ships and airplane lines to B ritain,
m unition factories and atom ic piles w ere developed in the
fa r no rth w ith local resources. E ngland’s necessities
Were being m ade secure ag ain st an other universal holo­
caust.
A fter th e G reat W ars th ere w ere m ore th an a million
voters in th e U nited S tates born in G erm any and A ustria.
G erm any’s quota exceeded th a t of any other nation. A t
least tw enty percent of the population w ere enrolled
am ong th e Beerbibbers. These of course w ere n o t all
G erm ans or of G erm an descent. M any w ere m erely allied
to G erm ans by m arriage, m any w ere m erely bibblers or
bootleggers of various nationalities, including hundred
percent A m ericans.
The B eerbibbers had alw ays been active pacifists or
isolationists in the U nited S tates. Since the revenue
from alcoholic liquors had been lost, th ey dem anded th a t
th e expenses of the country be cut by abolishing the
arm y, the navy, by to ta l disarm am ent. This th ey argued
w ould lower taxation, and no one, especially the w orking­
m an, could deny the logic of this argum ent. L abor dis­
turbances had become chronic and could be curbed only
by m ilitary force. The abolition of th e arm y therefore
m eant g re a te r license to labor.
Mr. H ighland had been elected despite capitalism , his
term of office w as n earin g its close and he w as looking
forw ard to a second term . V otes from W all S treet w ere
out of th e question, so w hile a general strike w as in pro­
gress he disbanded the arm y, passed a five-day w orking
w eek w ithout reduction of w ages, and transform ed the
navy and aeronavy into a m erchant m arine and aerine.
Of course th e w ar ships and air ships w ere not scrapped,
they w ere m erely allowed to become obsolete and for lack
of appropriations no new ones w ere built. The country
had prospered by rem aining n eu tral in the w ar betw een
G erm any and Italy. Ita ly w hich had been an arm ed
cam p, or ra th e r a nation of cam p-follow ers, had been
brought to u tte r ruin. G erm any w ithout an arm y or navy
or aeronavy yesterday had risen again overnight to be a
g re a t w orld power. In case of necessity, A m erica could
do w h at G erm any had done. T hese w ere the specious
argum ents used to disarm the U nited S tates, and no one
used these argum ents m ore assiduously th an G erm any.
H ighland w as re-elected on a w ave of popular hysteria,
Rudolf R othkopf w as elected vice-president.
A fter the W orld W ars, F rance had had inspectors in
G erm any to g uard ag ain st any preparations for another
w ar. D uring the w ar ag ain st Italy, these inspectors had
been ignored by force m ajeure, but now a fter the con­
clusion of peace and encouraged by B ritain, F rance in­
sisted th a t these inspectors be perm itted to renew th eir
duties. The m ore insistent F rance becam e, th e m ore ob­
stin ate G erm any grew un til finally she told h er ancient
enem y to atten d to her own business.
The Tricolor had been insulted, th ere w as only one
answ er—an ultim atum . G erm any ignored the u tlim atum
and rushed h er forces flushed w ith victory tow ard A lsace-
L orraine. She had tak en these provinces from F rance in
1871. The extensive beds of iron ore in L orraine, the
g re a t textile industries, v a st deposits of potash, th e salt
and petroleum of A lsace w ere not y et exhausted.
In the form er w ars G erm any had tak en the initiative,
th e fighting had been done on F rench soil. N ow the
F rench w ere in F ran k fo rt and Cologne before the G er­
m ans and A ustrians debouched from the Black Forest.
G erm any had restrained herself in deep design. F ran ce’s
initial success and G erm any’s failure to m ake a move in
the direction of B russels and P aris, k ep t E ngland and
B elgium out of the w ar. G erm any specifically declared
th a t Belgium w as in no danger, th a t she w as fig h tin g a
purely defensive w ar, th a t she had been attack ed and
invaded w ithout giving th e slightest provocation, as all
th e w orld bore w itness.
E ngland w as not deceived, b u t the U nited S tates
again declared h er neutrality, and m ost of the nations of
the w orld refused to tak e sides ag ainst G erm any. They
rem ained indeed neu tral in principle though not strictly
so in business. Then E ngland knew th a t G erm any had
mobilized her full stren g th ag ain st F rance and th a t an ­
o ther w ar m ight add glory and possessions to G erm any’s
flag, b u t w ould w eaken h er m an power. She would see
to it th a t G erm any got none of F ran ce’s colonies, nothing
b u t th e lost provinces. B esides E ngland had no m ore
“blood and sw eat” to w age a continental w ar. A ccording­
ly E ngland this tim e considered discretion the b e tter p a rt
of valor, and decided to abide h er tim e.

slau g h terer of th e innocents, w allow s the tw enty-third
regim ent. M any of the m en in its thinned ran k s w ere

F rench m ore fluently th an G erm an; in fact, they are
French, b u t a ty ran n ical flag has im pressed them into
service to poison and blind and m aim th eir own k ith and
kin. The dire stra its of th eir oppressors, decim ated by
ju st and righteous m itrailleuses, and accelerated by
avenging tim e, has caused these m en of fifty and older
to be stationed here n ear th eir hom es on th e W estern
F ront, instead of being dispersed one by one am ong hos­
tile hordes on the E ast, in accord w ith the P russian
principle of expatriation and disintegration.
These m en never expect and never receive prom otion,
th ey form the files of the com panies to w hich they are a t­
tached, and rarely tw o of them stand shoulder to shoulder,
unless the intervening P ru ssian is blow n to atom s. They
handle nothing b u t th e spade and w ire-cutter, rarely the
rifle, w hen they are n o t hounded about to perform m enial
duties, and th ey advance only in m assed form ation.
They never re tre a t or surrender, fo r P russian bullets
are behind and betw een them , and w hen one of th eir num ­
ber falls, he begs his cam arade to le t him lie and die, th a t
he m ay be spared fu rth e r treason ag ain st L a P atrie.
One of these m odern unm anum itted am es dam nees
dragooned into a fratricid al cause, is a w ealthy gentle­
m an of L orraine, fifty years of age, tall, dark, lithe, of
aristo cratic m ien and carriage. H is n a tu ra l refinem ent
cannot be hidden even by his unkem pt hair, bristling
beard, and ragged and reeking uniform . He has not been
given the opportunity to enjoy a shave or bath or change
of raim ent for a m onth, and his m ustaches are still clog­
ged w ith the crum bs of the stale bread and stalactites of
the rancid soup on w hich he is condem ned to subsist. He
has slept in bogged trenches, been frozen and soaked
periodically, and devoured by verm in. The san itary tre n ­
ches, salubrious baths, wholesom e food, and antiseptic
clothes of th e subsidized w ar correspondent have not fall­
en to his lot.
H e is seated on a cartrid g e case betw een the n arro w '
tren ch w alls, b u t his vision outranges the periscope a t his
side. A round him v ast c raters are being instantaneously
scooped out of the earth, aerial torpeaues are bursting
above his head, and beneath his feet sappers are m ining
forw ard and laying the fuses of volcanic eruptions. B ut
he is deaf and oblivious to all this isotonic in stru m en ta­
tion and clangorous cacophony of Pandem onium . H e sees
his w ife and young children seated beneath the vines th a t
cling around his chateau, a few leagues aw ay, n ear Metz.
H is h e a rt is filled w ith forbodings. He does not ex­
pect to live w hen the T ricolor w aves above the L orraine
fortress, y et he hopes and believes th a t one day the
Schw artz und W eisz will be hurled down. B ut u tte r anni­
hilation m ust level the sw ath of the advancing French
legions, and his home and w ife and children lie directly
in th eir path! If they could only rem ain hidden in one of
th e deep caves th a t hoards th e juice of his vines, till his
com patriots should have passed beyond! B ut the re tre a t­
ing Boches would leave no living soul in th eir w ake, th a t
he w ell knows.
The te a rs stream down his sunk and sallow cheeks,
and h is lips can only m urm ur a heart-rending p ray er for
th e safety of his flesh and blood.
The C hateau d’E sperance is sufficiently rem ote from
any m ilitary establishm ent to be im m une against the ever-
grow ing intrepidity and infallibleness of the F rench aces.
— 20—
Besides, an adjoining convent and orphanage adds to its
sanctity. F or this very reason it has been artfully chosen
to be the headquarters of the field m arshal com m anding
the V erdun arm y, w ho does not despise to hide his Meph-
istophelian physiognom y behind the innocence of such wo­
m en as his m en had raped, and such infants as his m yr­
m idons had crucified. Of him , who callously sends his sold­
iers in hundreds of thousands to a futile slaughter, w hile
he him self basks in safety and luxury, it m ay be said:
‘M ephistopheles comes before us, not arrayed in the
terro rs of Cocytus and Phlegethon, b u t w ith the n a tu ral
indelible deform ity of w ickedness. He is the Devil, not of
superstition, but of knowledge. Such a com bination of
perfect understanding w ith perfect selfishness, of logical
life w ith m oral death, so universal a denier both in h e a rt
and head, is undoubtedly a child of D arkness, an em issary
of the prim eval N othing, and m ay stand in his m erely
spiritual deform ity, a t once potent, dangerous, and con­
tem ptible, as the best and only genuine Devil of these
la tte r tim es.”
He had not carried his baton in his knapsack, b u t had
sharpened his teeth on it in his cradle, dei g ratia!
His long, lank nose protrudes pestilentially into the
business of a w hole nation; his bum ptious, beardless
chin recedes from every act of justice and virtue; while
his dull, shifty eyes blink beneath a cap tilted laterally in
disdain of the whole universe.
He sleeps in th e soft beds of the bedless owner in the
trenches, sucks the grapes from the vineyard, swills the
w ines from the cellars, of the starv in g and th irstin g vin­
ta g e r before Verdun. D ainty m orsels to tickle his jaded
palate have been garnered from the surrounding country,
and are w hirled around w ith him in his retinue of m otor
cars. H e has b u tte r and eggs and cheese from Holland,
caviar from Poland, sm oked fish from N orw ay, raisins
from Greece, dried figs from Sm yrna.
The room he occupies is brilliantly illum inated and
com fortably heated w ith the tim ber of the chatelain shiv­
ering in the d ark dug-outs. M orning and n ight he bathes
in the w ater draw n from the rippling brook of the bedrag­
gled, unw ashed and unshaven vavasour. A barber accom ­
panies him, shaves and sham poos him every day, and ev­
ery eve and m orn his lackeys assist him into fresh, p er­
fum ed linen and g litterin g uniform .
N either does he lack the society of women. H is staff
have invited a num ber of girls and ladies from the neigh­
borhood, to celebrate an o th er pyrric victory before V er­
dun. The w ife of the m an w hom he has deprived of home
and household, th e chatelaine, for w hom a desolate hus­
band can only pray, is also there, because th e field m ar­
shal has sum m oned her from h er room and she dare not
disobey.
She is a tall, queen-like brunette, probably not yet
th irty , but em aciated by nocturnal vigils. D ark circles
surround her large eyes, lustrous w ith fear and fever, and
now tw o hectic spots glow on her otherw ise w ax-w hite
face.
She shudders a t the atten tio n s of h er self-invited
guest. The blood rushes to h er brow, then she becomes
pale as death.
The field m arshal tak es a T urkish cig arette from a
bejew elled case, tap s it on his thum b nail, and lig h ts it
w ith the aid of a p a ten t tinder-box suspended w ith nu­
m erous o ther pendants from a m assive gold chain. A fter
a few sybaritic puffs, he allows the tinder-box to drop,
and selects a sm all m anicurer to rem ove a speck of dust
w hich he had noticed beneath his thum b nail. Then he
tak es a quill hilted in gold to pick a particle of tobacco
from betw een his teeth.
The chatelaine w atches in ho rro r all these careless
m ovem ents w hich are y et perform ed deliberately as if to
tantalize her. She know s th a t her husband has not been
able to sm oke even the coarsest tobacco since he w as
dragged from her arm s. She sees his nails w orn to the
quick by enforced toil am id shot and shell, and his teeth
coated w ith offal w hich he h as not been able to brush off
since he w as forced from his home.
She would like to snatch his arom atic cigarette from
betw een h er provoker’s lips and jam it into his eyes
w hich leer a t her satyrically; knock out w ith a cham ­
pagne bottle his teeth, w hich are brushed m orning, noon,
and night, and w hich now sm irk upon her in undisguised
covetousness; and nip w ith his bejew elled nail-clipper
those fingers and nails professionally m anicured and pol­
ished, w hich he now presses brazenly into her arm as he
leads her to a retired seat.
She refused to drink, but he says: “You m ust,” and
she tries to force a fevv drops betw een her lips. They al­
m ost choke her.
She sees h er tw o children who are try in g to sleep in
one of the upper room s. The one, barely five years of
age, is ailing, and the m aid vainly tries to rock it to rest.
The noise of the ram paging officers, and now the ab­
sence of th eir m other, has kep t them aw ake fo r hours.
A t the opposite end of the salon are tw o heavy oak
tables adjoining each other. A t the one are seated a
num ber of radio-telephonists and telegraphists, perpetu­
ally tapping and talking, day and night; a t the other are
several sta ff officers, w ith m athem atical instrum ents in
th eir hands, poring over m aps and charts, receiving and
issuing rep o rts and orders, w hich are im m ediately check­
ed and charted. Several other room s in th e chateau are
used for sim ilar purposes.
E very half hour or so, the field m arshal approaches
the tables and discusses th e latest moves w ith the highest
officers.
“W hat does your H ighness think of young H eulenberg
asking fo r m ore tro o p s? ” ventures a satellite.
K reutz! Him m el! D onnerw etter!” curses the field m ar­
shal. “N ot a regim ent from here! W e’ll tak e th a t dam ned
V erdun yet, even if it costs a million m en.”
“H eulenberg says it can’t be done, and if it could, it
w ould cost too much, and leave us too w eak on the E a st.”
“W hat does th a t m arsh ra t know ? W hat has he
done? N othing! If I ’d been on the E ast, I ’d have w intered
in D anzig last year.”
“He says he could have got to D anzig th is spring, if
he’d had the troops th a t have been lost here.”
“Do you think th a t I’m going to allow th a t m arsh
ra t to have troops to tak e him to D anzig, before I g et to
P aris, and if I have to h alt the a tta c k on V erdun?”
“He says you w ill have to stop w hether you w ish
or not.”
“W e’ll see about th at! So long as th ere’s a regim ent
in G erm any, I ’ll have it. H aven't I slaughtered all the
F rench reserves ? I t ’s only a m a tte r of a few m ore w eeks,
and V erdum will be behind us, and P aris before us.”
All this braggadocio w as being vented w hile G erm any
w as a t peace w ith Poland and Russia, w hile R ussia still
occupied the eastern provinces of G erm any, w hile Field
M arshal von H eulenberg w as m erely guarding the border
betw een G erm an and R ussian forces in constant fear th a t
R ussia m ight a t any m om ent launch an a tta c k on G er­
m any, or order Polish troops to invade G erm any.
“The F rench w ith th eir volunteers seem still to have
a few m en left, or they would not be able to undertake
such a pow erful offensive on the M euse,” apologetically
suggests the satellite.
“W hat’s th a t? ” snaps the field m arshal. “Shock!
Schw ernot! Those dam ned shop-keepers! I t ’s nothing! A f­
te r a few thousand of them get blinded and poisoned w ith
our gas, and a fte r a few hundred w om en and children
are blown to pieces by our Zeppelins, th ey ’ll slink back to
th eir holes. W hen I ’m finished here, I ’ll give some a tte n ­
tion to the other end of the line, and drive them into the
Channel, the G erm an Channel, I’ll call it.”
“The people are calling for H eulenberg as chief-of-
staff. He says we should act only on the defensive on the
W est.”
“The people! P erdition tak e the people! W hat have
th ey to say in the m a tte r ?
“T h at shows w h at a fool the m arsh ra t is, like his
fath er. H e w an ts m y troops to rob m e of the eternal
glory I am gaining here.
“Greece w ill never join F rance so long as a G erm an
queen rules there. W e have bought the G reek arm y, the
posts and telegraphs, the navy; our subm arines are re ­
plenished from the Piraeus, and w e have bought the whole
press and the politicians, and th e king together. We
prom ised them h alf of Serbia, and so she even betrayed
h er ally to us. H ow will she then join F rance ?
“A s to R oum ania, haven’t we ju st m ade a tre a ty w ith
h er? W e’ll give h er B essarabia, and w e’ll prom ise her
T ranssylvannia, b u t w hen th e R ussians are driven across
the U ral M ountains, we m ay decide to keep T ranssylvan­
nia ourselves,” he added w ith a sly leer.
— 21—
“If w e’ve got to leave C onstantinople nom inally un­
der the T urks, w e m ay have to extend the G erm an E m ­
pire to the m ouths of the D anube. A u stria has been prom ­
ised Saloniki.”
“B ut Saloniki belongs to the G reeks,” urged th e sa t­
ellite.
“W hat’s th a t ? To th e G reeks ? W hat have they done
to help us in th is w ar? If w e give h er Cyprus, and the
islands th a t Italy took, we w an t som ething in retu rn , and
th a t som ething w ill be Saloniki. Then w e’ll give K avala to
B ulgaria.”
“B ut w h at w ill T urkey sa y ? ”
“T urkey will say nothing, because w e’ve prom ised
them G erm an protection, b u t all the civil and m ilitary of­
ficials m ust be G erm ans, and every concession given to
o ther nations w ill be revoked and handed over to us, so
th a t in tim e T urkey w ill be practically in our hands, and
be joined as an in teg ral p a rt of the G erm an E m pire.”
“B ut doesn’t Greece w an t S m y rn a?”
“W hat she w ants and w h at she’ll g et are tw o differ­
ent things. The whole of A sia M inor to the P ersian
Gulf, and then down to A den and Suez, is P russian. T h at’s
w hy R oum ania will have to join the G erm an C onfedera­
tion. We shall ship our goods down th e D anube and then
across th e B lack Sea, to Odessa and to A rm enia. I t ’ll be
cheaper th an th e rail across Stam boul. Then w e’ll build
a g reat harbor a t th e m ouths of th e D anube, and from
there w e’ll a tta c k Odessa, and tak e all the coasts of the
B lack Sea.”
“I’ve heard it w hispered th a t w e’ve prom ised Saloniki
to B u lg aria?”
“I believe w e have, b u t she w on’t g et it, you can be
quite sure of th a t.”
H ere the conversation is interru p ted by an im portant
dispatch.
“E very regim ent th a t we send th ere is annihilated,”
says an officer, pointing to a spot on the m ap. “W hich
shall w e send there n o w ?”
The field m arshal looks in the direction of the ch at­
elaine. She has disappeared.
“W here is the tw en ty -th ird ?” he inquires.
The satellite refers to a roster.
“There are m any m en from L orraine in the tw enty-
th ird .”
“N ever m ind; so m uch the better. Send the tw enty-
th ird there, and have our guns trained on them , and chain
them to the m achine guns, and if th ey atte m p t to su r­
render or escape to our lines, in case th eir trenches are
destroyed and rushed, shoot every m an of them .”
The officer salutes, and d ictates the necessary order
to an operator.
* * * *
A terrific storm is raging over Verdun. The elem ents
“w inged w ith red lightning and tem pestuous rag e” are
try in g to outdo th e flash of cannon and th e w hiz of pro­
jectile, b u t m iserably they fail. The artillery of heaven
b u rsts forth, clap upon clap, as if it would rend th e earth
in tw ain, b u t “the deep dread-bolted thunder” is drow n­
ed by the deafening detonations of m an. The m achine-
guns of the sky will, however, not be cowed by th is over­
w helm ing bom bilation. The hail swoops down as a cur­
ta in of fire from a cloud-burst, and ra ttle s harm lessly on
to the steel helm et of the m odern M ars, who contem ptu­
ously sm iles a t th is parody of his own death-dealing de­
bacle. A s if angered by th is show of hum an disdain,
th e lightning strik es down an officer, and the m en stop
to laugh a t this burlesque. The death of one w here m il­
lions have fallen, fills them only w ith am usem ent.
T aking advantage of th is n atu ral disturbance, the
G erm ans have launched another abortive a ttem p t to p u t
V erdun behind them . The tw enty-third is being driven as
sheep to the sham bles. M any of them , like beasts of b u r­
den, have strapped to th eir backs heavy m etal cylinders,
w hich contain the chem icals of liquid fire. A P russian be­
hind directs the nozzle a t th e enemy, and very often tu rn s
it on to the b earer of the incinerating drum .
One of these pack-slaves is the chatelain. H e sta g ­
gers forw ard as he is b ru tally com m anded, w ith his back
and head bent forw ard close to th e ground, so th a t he
sees nothing b u t the shell-torn earth a t his feet. H e is
still in the firs t rank, though hundreds have fallen around
him . He does not h ear the buzz of the m itrailleuse bul­
lets, nor the w histle of com m and. H e presses on heedless
of groans and curses, callous to the blood rushing in
stream s from his lim bs lacerated by barbed wire.
A t his feet, th e vision of his w ife and children beckon
him onw ard to eternal peace.
Suddenly the P russian behind him lurches forw ard
w ith a cry of terro r. The nozzle sinks w ith him voiding
its deadly flam e over the chatelain and around into the
faces of th e doomed G erm ans. A t the sam e in stan t the
sanguinary spray of a m itrailleuse scatters th e soil
around them , and the m a rty r of L orraine falls to the
earth and renders up his soul w ith a sigh of relief and
p ray er:
* * * *
“Vive L a P a trie !”
I t is p a st m idnight w hen the field m arshal enters
the chatelaine’s room unannounced. She is in bed, unable
to sleep, w ith h er youngest child in h er arm s.
A fain t cry of te rro r escapes her as she recognizes
the intruder, and she shrinks back, clutching her child to
her bosom.
“W hy did you leave th e salon w ithout m y perm is­
sio n ?” he dem ands haughtily.
She is unable to find w ords or voice fo r answ er, but
can only sta re a t him as a paralyzed creature.
H e repeats his question m ore perem torily, yet flattered
by her fear.
She s ta rts and stu tte rs:
“M y child is sick . . . .”
“Well, let the serv an t look a fte r it,” he replies cal­
lously. “H ere, slavey,” he continues harshly, addressing
th e girl who sleeps w ith th e elder child in another bed,
and w ho has been aw akened by his loud voice, “tak e this
kid into an other room, and tak e th a t one w ith you too,
and don’t let them bother your m istress again tonight.
You can look a fte r them as w ell as she.”
The serv an t obeys m echanically as a person in a
dream . H er m istress is too terrified to m ore th an in­
stinctively resist th e rem oval of h er child. H er eyes are
riv etted on th e om nipotent ogre, the arb iter of h er person,
property, posterity, and partner.
W hile the m aid carries th e child aw ay, the field m ar­
shal drops on to a settee a t th e side of the bed, negligent­
ly draw s his jew eled case from his vest pocket, selects a
gold-tipped cigarette, drives it as a m iniature pile on to
his nail, lig h ts it w ith his p aten t tinder-box, and a fte r
a few probative puffs, tu rn s his puckered eyes in th e di­
rection of the chatelaine.
The sm oke seem s to obstruct his vision, he w aves il
aside w ith his hand, and looks again. Then he s ta rts to
his feet, and bends his head forw ard to obtain a clearer
view.
A pale corpse lies on the bed.
God has spared also h er a life of treason.
Vive L a France!
CHAPTER 6
SU BM ARIN ES
Supplies flowed into both countries from all p a rts of
th e w orld until th e F rench navy in th e M editerranean and
in th e A tlantic began to tak e a heavy toll of G erm an
shipping, then the G erm an subm arine began its nefarious
w ork. How fam iliar it all is to us oldsters, b u t to our
children it w as as a chapter from an unread book.
The good ship Roosendahl is outw ard bound from
R otterdam to N ew Y ork, freighted w ith a purely D utch
cargo of cheese, cocoa, etc., and bearing a few neu tral
and A m erican passengers. C aptain V an den Lingen has
tak en every precaution to keep his ship free of anything
th a t can be construed into a breach of neutrality. H e has
fu rth e r had the foresight to insure his life and m ake his
will, fo r he is w ell aw are th a t Civis A m ericanus sum is as
m uch despised as Civis R om anus sum w as respected, and
the m ere fa c t of his being a n eu tral w ith tem erity
enough to sail the high seas ag ain st G erm any’s com­
m andm ent: “No one shall cross the ocean so long as I am
barred, and fu rth e r to insure by preponderance in tonnage
a fte r th e w ar, I am determ ined to sink every ship th a t is
unable to pro tect itself ag ain st m y subm arines,” is suffic­
ient to condem n him to death.
If he w ere not bound fo r an A m erican port, he m ight
— 22—
have had the prudence to m ount a long range gun on his
decks, and tak en a chance a t discovering the assassins
first and sinking them before they had th e opportunity
of launching a torpedo a t him . B ut as his helm is set
fo r “God’s own country,” “the land of th e free,” “the
m other of civilization,” w here it is “the inalienable rig h t
of every m an to be born equal,” he is compelled to obey
its law s th a t every n eu tral shall risk death on unequal
term s.
The law says:
“W hen you spy a G erm an subm arine, you shall stop
im m ediately, hold up your hands in token of subm ission,
allow yourself to be pillaged, placed in an open boat in
m id ocean, so th a t you m ay die of th irst, starvation, and
exposure; see your ship blown to the devil, w hile you
w histle Y ankee Doodle and sing H ail Columbia. B u t if
you try to save your ship and property from destruction,
and your w ife and children from any or all of the above
m entioned deaths, and a G erm an torpedo should blow you
prem aturely into the K ingdom w here all A m ericans have
had special seats reserved fo r them because of th eir m ul­
tifarious virtues, do not ask P resident H ighland to send
another note to the president of G erm any, fo r he has not
y et com pleted his series on a form er affair.”
A m ong the passengers are the newly-wed cousins,
G erald and G eraldine W ashington, lineal descendants of
the Founder of the Republic. She is a tall, blond, som e­
w h at em aciated Gibson girl of tw enty, convalescing a fte r
a nervous break-dow n in G erm any, w here the outbreak
of hostilities had in terru p ted her m usic studies, and
sh attered her health. U nable to retu rn w ith the exodus
of A m ericans, she had gone through one brain-storm a fte r
another, and w hen sufficiently recovered to support the
stra in of the voyage, the subm arine atrocities had already
been inaugurated, and in h er nervous prostration, she w as
too terrified to risk the indiscrim inate dangers.
H er fiance had proposed to m arry her in H olland, and
escort her back on a n eu tral ship, but she had continu­
ously dissuaded him , so th a t it w as in th e fall before
th ey w ere able to spend th eir honeym oon on board the
Roosendahl.
G erald is a strap p in g Saxon of tw enty-five, w ith
featu res th a t closely resem ble those of his w ife; frank,
open, blue eyes th a t distinguish him from th e A m erican
who has a cunning leer and a crafty sm irk to index his
proclivities in sport or business. H is atten tio n s to his
w ife are not those of a husband only, but his solicitude for
h er health discloses the tra its of the tender nurse of some
w ounded com rade.
The deck is spick and span, as scrupulously scrubbed
as th e vitrified cobbles of a D utch village. The sky is as
blue as th eir eyes, as peaceful as th eir souls, and G erald
stretched a t th e feet of his bride, w onders how m en can
destroy each o ther as ferocious beasts along thousands of
m iles of fighting lines th a t probably w ill rem ain w here
th ey w ere before the leaders of these m en w ere seized
w ith hom icidal m ania.
N ot fa r d istan t b u t below the sea-line, the G erm an
subm arine, U 13, and th e U.S.A. steam er, S tars and
Stripes, w ithin easy speaking distance of each other, are
cu ttin g the w aves a t an even knotage.
C aptain H erm ann is a native of B rem en b u t a citizen
of th e U.S.A. H e is carrying wood fibre from Bergen,
and had m et th e U 13 a few days previously to the no rth
of Scotland.
The tw o G erm an captains had quickly arranged term s
fo r th eir m utual advantage. F rom the high m asts of the
steam er, w hen another ship is sighted, the U is w arned,
and either dives or disappears. The torpedoes are being
w ithheld fo r m any w eighty reasons of S tate. F irstly, th e
S tars and S tripes m ust n o t be com prom ised. Then the U
had received stric t orders to reserve h er m urderous m is­
siles fo r a spectacular raid a t th e very doors of the U.S.A.
She even evades costly m en-of-w ar, as she does not w ish
to risk a re tu rn blow, b u t to sink defenseless c ra ft and
thus terrorize n eu tral m erchantm en from the high seas,
although th e opportunity to sink them would a t all tim es
be welcomed, fo r th a t fits in w ith the P russian plans of
post-bellum preponderance.
A rrived a t the A m erican port, the U sends a code
m essage to the G erm an am bassador, in structing him to
have the S tars and S tripes laden w ith oil and o ther sup­
plies, and to arran g e to have the U furnished w ith w ire­
less m essages concerning th e sailings of boats and the
localities of F rench w ar ships.
The presence of th e U no longer creates w onder, for
she had been preceded by others, b u t consternation ranges
am ong th e thousands of passengers and crew s th a t are
a t her m ercy, and this is not allayed by th e U cap tain ’s
barefaced speciousness th a t he had m erely brought a
m essage for the am bassador.
Then before the innocent can be w arned or a tta in
shelter, the G erm an sets off for th e N ew E ngland coast
on her heroic ta s k of strik in g w here there are none to
strik e back, and hiding in cow ardly subm ersion w here
those able to defend them selves are to be encountered.
The S tars and Stripes laden w ith oil, bombs, and
o ther cargo destined fo r h er recent consort, approaches
th e scene of action innocently and im m unely flaunting her
colors a t the F rench cruisers w hich she passes and whose
positions she im m ediately w irelesses to the U. H er p a­
pers are m ade out for a C entral A m erican port, and if a
F rench cruiser had dared to hold her up m erely for the
purpose of legitim ate search, the whole of the U nited
S tates would have howled itself black in the face against
F ran ce’s breach of neutrality.
N ot ten m iles d istan t from the A m erican coast, the
S tars and Stripes tran sfers to the U the pow er of de­
stroying n eu tral ships w hich are carrying m erchandise
sold by A m erica a t usurious prices. W ithout this blood­
sucking trad e A m erica w ould be in the throes of the
g rav est crisis in its history, m illions of m en and w om en
would be w alking the streets starving.
The Roosendahl is nearing her destination, she has
received the w ireless w arning, and a hom ew ard bound
vessel has even tossed a new spaper on board containing
accounts of the la te st subm arine atrocities.
W hile G erald reads to his wife, the first officer of th e
ship stands by and listens in anxious silence.
“ ‘The day of the ostrich— elocutionary ostrich—policy
fo r the U nited S tates has passed,’ Col. H olland asserted
in a statem en t issued tonight.
“The U -boat raids off the coasts of N ew E ngland,
Col. H olland charged, w ere the direct resu lt of P resident
H ighland’s subm issive policy tow ard G erm any in regards
to the rig h ts of neutrals.
“The boldness of th e G erm ans in sending a subm arine
to w aylay shipping off th e A m erican C oast w as th e cul­
m ination, he said, of E uropean contem pt for the U nited
S tates.
“H e blam es the la te st crisis to the fa c t th a t P resi­
dent H ighland, a fte r declaring th a t the U nited S tates
w ould stand as th e cham pion of the rig h ts of neutrals,
has deserted th e n eu tral nations and left them leader­
less and the prey of the belligerents.
“ ‘Now th a t the w ar has been carried to our very
shores there is no A m erican who does not realize the
aw ful trag ed y of our indifference and inaction,’ Col. H ol­
land said. 'N ine-tenths of w isdom is being w ise in tim e.
B y ta k in g the rig h t step a t the rig h t tim e A m erica’s in­
fluence and leadership m ight have been a stabilizing
force.
“ ‘P resident H ighland’s ignoble shirking of respon­
sibility has been clothed in an u tterly m isleading phrase
— the phrase of the cow ard— ‘he kep t us out of w ar.’ In
actu al reality w ar has been creeping n earer and n earer
un til it stares a t us from ju st beyond our three mile
lim it, and we face it w ithout policy, plan, purpose, or
preparation’.”
A verting his gaze from his pale wife, G erald tu rn s to
the officer and exclaim s bitterly :
“I am alm ost asham ed to be an A m erican. I have
w itnessed tw o fiascos in Mexico, A m ericans m urdered
w ith im punity tim e w ithout num ber, and now th is.”
“The law of A m erica places us a t th e m ercy of these
subm arines,” replies the officer. “W e can carry only de­
fensive guns, b u t we are not allowed to use even them .
The law of A m erica says w e m ust stop w hen a subm arine
hails us. We dare not run aw ay, and w e dare not fire a
gun. W e m ust stop, get into our boats, and see our ship
blow n to pieces. W e are n o t allowed to defend our p ro ­
perty, because A m erica says we m ust not. If one cargo
is destroyed, A m erica is ready to sell us an other a t a
higher price. Those are A m erican business principles.
“You know th is is true, because subm arines destroy
every ship th a t belongs to us neu trals; th ey ’d destroy
A m erican ships too, as they have done in the past, if they
did n o t understand th a t A m erica inw ardly desires th e de­
struction of as m any cargoes as possible because it’s good
for A m erican trade. E very neu tral except A m erica, and
she’s not neutral, is tre a te d w ith contem pt. I t is an ab­
solute certain ty th a t w hen a G erm an subm arine sights a
n eu tral ship, she sinks it if she can, and we have to sub­
m it.
“The whole w orld know s th a t G erm any has decided
th a t there shall not be any n eu tral ships a fte r th e w ar,
so th a t h er own ships w hich are now safe in h er harbors
or being protected in n eu tral harbors, m ay monopolize the
shipping trad e of the w orld a fte r th e w ar.
“If we w ere allowed to carry guns a t least equal in
range, calibre, and rap id ity w ith those of th e subm a­
rines, if w e w ere allowed to fire them w hen we catch
sight of a subm arine, or allowed to try and escape, there
m ight be a chance for us, b u t now w e are condem ned by
your civilized country to p erm it the destruction of all we
possess. If we w ere allowed to defend ourselves properly,
subm arines w ould not dare to approach n ear enough to
discharge torpedoes w ith accuracy, and a t a longer range
we should be th eir equals, perhaps superiors.”
“I should like to see n eutrals stop all com m unication
w ith the S tates,” continued Gerald. “If they refused to
buy anything from us fo r six m onths, w e should feel the
pinch so acutely th a t it w ould not tak e long for our pusil­
lanim ous governm ent to prohibit G erm an subm arines
from approaching our coasts and to accord foreign ships
th e necessary protection fo r trad in g w ith us in safety.
N eutrals ought to arm every one of th eir boats, and allow
them to call only a t C anadian ports, if our country will
n o t perm it them to properly arm and defend them selves,
and will not enforce th eir im m unity if th ey are engaged
in trad e w hich is purely peaceful.”
“Y our country rem inds me of a m erchant who is in
league w ith highw ay robbers to a tta c k his custom ers so
th a t they m ay come back fo r m ore.”
G eraldine shivers a t th is incontestable accusation.
A cold w ind has sprung up, and the w aves are dashing
w ildly over the bows of th e ship, b u t no one dare go be­
low.
Suddenly a cry of joy is heard aloft, and the officer
explains th a t an A m erican m erchant cruiser is approach­
ing.
“T hank God! W e are safe now,” exclaim s G eraldine
w ith a sigh of relief, and the look of intense feeling which
had clouded the face of h er husband vanishes in a m o­
m ent.
B ut th ey have hardly tim e to congratulate each other
w hen another cry is heard from the look-out:
“Periscope on the p o rt bow!”
They look a t each o ther in sudden revulsion, b u t the
sm oke from th e A m erican cruiser though dism antled, re ­
assures them and prevents a panic.
The U signals the Roosendahl to stop, then orders
h er captain to low er his boats and quit the ship.
The A m erican cruiser receives th e w ireless fo r help,
b u t C aptain V an den Lingen has only ten m inutes to
com ply w ith th e perem ptory orders of th e subm arine.
G eraldine has fainted, and is being carried to a boat
in th e stro n g arm s of h er husband. The ship in a m om ent
has been transform ed into a m ass of agonized hum an
beings. Several other w om en have swooned, one has lost
h er m ind and sprung into the sea. A m id all th is cruel
consternation, there is no tim e or opportunity to save her.
O rders and shrieks drown each other, m en and w om en and
children rush h ith er and th ith e r in despair a t th e n efari­
ous necessity of being to m from all they possess, clothes,
heirloom s, precious souvenirs, the bedding th a t w as to
give them repose in th e N ew W orld. Then th e prospect of
those ruthless w aves and th e piercing wind in the open
boats w ith th eir infants and wives and daughters and
sisters and m others! W hat a welcome from th e S tatue of
L iberty!
An officer and several of the crew of the undersea
assassin have now boarded the Roosendahl.
Gerald shouts to them :
“I’m an A m erican citizen.”
“I ’m sorry you’re not the P resident of the U nited
S tates of A m erica,” replies the officer contem ptuously,
and he orders C aptain V an den L ingen to cut his boats
adrift.
W hile the innocent m a rty rs of th e behests of two
presidents are undergoing th eir torm ent, the P russian of­
ficer and his m en loot and pillage th e R oosendahl of all
those precious possessions abandoned by th eir victim s.
B efore they have com pleted th eir vile piracy, the
A m erican cruiser has arrived on the scene, and begun its
search fo r the scattered life-boats.
G erald has been picked up and appeals to the A m eri­
can com m ander:
“I ’m a descendant of W ashington, I ’ve fought and
bled for m y country, and I ask you to p ro tect m y p roperty
on th a t ship. All m y w ife’s belonging are there, and sure­
ly they have no rig h t to sink A m erican p roperty ?”
“I’m sorry, Sir,” replies the com m ander. “I ’ve in stru c­
tions to preserve stric t neutrality, and cannot interfere.”
The cruiser lies betw een the doomed Roosendahl and
the subm arine. The U com m ander calls the A m erican
to move his ship out of the w ay as he w ishes to shell the
H ollander. The A m erican complies in accordance w ith
A m erican notions of n eutrality, w hile G erald suppresses
an oath.
“T h at’s w h at your A m erican m en-of-w ar do to help
n eu trals,” says C aptain V an den L ingen sarcastically.
“They’re not A m ericans,” m u tters G erald under his
breath. “Those are the scoundrels who have seized the
governm ent of our glorious republic and brought it e te r­
n al ignom iny, those are the renegades who are too proud
to fig h t.”
“No th ey ’re not,” reto rte d C aptain V an den Lingen.
“Those are th e A m ericans th a t C aptain C hichester saved
a t M anila. This is one of the very ships. H ave you never
heard the sto ry ? A dm iral Dewey told it to an E nglish
lord, so it is true. He inform ed him th a t the presence
a t M anila of G erm an cruisers w ith a heavier displacem ent
th a n th a t of th e A m erican ships caused him to realize the
grave character of the danger in the event of the G erm an
ships beginning hostile action, of w hich he had reason to
be apprehensive.
“He described how the w hole A m erican fleet w atched
in silent anxiety the visit of th e G erm an adm iral to C ap­
tain C hichester’s ship and th e intense relief w ith w hich
they saw, shortly after, the G erm an adm iral retu rn to
his own ship, H is M ajesty’s ships under C aptain Chi­
chester’s com m and hoist th eir anchors and sh ift th eir
anchorage to a position w hich placed them in the direct
line of fire betw een the G erm an and th e A m erican ships.
“Com pare th e action of C aptain C hichester w ith th a t of
your A m erican captain.”
G erald grow s scarlet w ith im potent rage, and he h u r­
ries aw ay to the cabin w here his w ife lies in a half u n ­
conscious state, to g eth er w ith a child and an elderly lady
w ho have died of exposure.
The subm arine has already fired th irty bombs w ith­
out effect a t th e Roosendahl, w hich seem s a t every shot to
proclaim the injustice th a t is being p erp etrated ag ain st
her.
A sham ed of his gunnery, th e U com m ander now ord­
ers a torpedo to be hurled into the vitals of the ship th a t
ta u n ts him w ith his bullying attack.
W ith a terrible explosion, and scream s so hum an th a t
th ey appear to issue from th e th ro a ts of m arty rs suffer­
ing some N eroian to rtu re, the good ship, R oosendahl is
finally blown into the air, centrifuging eternal eddies or
sight and sound, like hum an em anations, w hich one day
in reproduction shall blind and deafen th e m aledicted
m onsters responsible for th is deed.
C aptain V an den L ingen draw s his hand across his
face to w ipe aw ay the tears th a t stream down his grief-
stricken features.
* * * *
G eraldine has a t last reached th e E astern hom e
w here she w as born, but the exposure and te rro r of those
last few hours w ithin sight of th e shores of A m erica have
left th eir m ark.
H er husband is seated a t her bedside, and reads to
h er as she bids him :
“One m ight think th a t th e w ords ‘our generous al­
lies’ w ere b u t the stereotyped com plim ent w ith w hich
F rench and E nglish officials address one another in pub­
lic. N ot a t all! They w ere w ritten by our own George
W ashington in his private diary, M ay 1, 1781. They re­
ferred to the French, w hose generous assistance he well
knew w as enabling him to brin g the A m erican w ar to a
triu m p h an t conclusion.
“I t is w ell fo r us A m ericans, if ever we should feel

under R ocham beau, who arrived a t our direst m om ent of
need and shared w ith our destitute colonials th e h ard ­
ships and the trium ph of Y orktow n— th e victory th a t
u ltim ately brought E ngland to term s. In addition there
w as the effective help of th e French navy and the ser­
vice of those m any ard en t young Frenchm en who, like L a­
fayette, Lauzun, and 'C hastelux, hastened to offer them ­
selves to the cause of liberty. M erely in m an pow er and
physical equipm ent the aid of F rance w as an extrem ely
valuable, possibly determ ining, assistance to us in our
hour of extrem e need.
“The m oral aid w as even greater. F rance w as the
first and only nation to recognize the struggling colonies
as a sister state. O ur E m issary Lee sought in vain for
help or even recognition am ong other E uropean nations.
Forbidden to en ter M adrid, he turned to the g re a t F red ­
erick a t Berlin, b u t w as not adm itted to audience, al­
though the P ru ssian king sent him w ord on his departure
th a t he should not be displeased to hear of any disaster
to England! The F rench alone dared the risk of recog­
nizing and helping a w eak people who w ere striving to
create th eir own country.
“Tim es have changed. E nglishm en are now fighting
by F ran ce’s side, also in the cause of universal liberty.
B u t w e in the persons of our legal representatives, our
congress, are passing m easures to authorize our president
not to help our ancient allies b u t to hinder them in the
prosecution of th eir struggle. Such is national gratitude.
Tim es have changed, and A m ericans m u st have changed.
“Some A m ericans have responded to the need of our
old generous allies! A few score of our young m en have
given th eir lives as L afayette and his fellow s gave theirs
to our forefathers. They have entered th e arm ies of
F ran ce or are serving as am bulance drivers and assistan ts
in hospitals. T hey are scores w here they should be thou­
sands! And th ey are volunteers, disowned by our own gov­
ernm ent as soon as they actually en ter the arm ies of
F rance, grudgingly perm itted to cross th e A tlantic and
give them selves to France.
“A s a nation w e have done nothing w hatever. All our
g ifts—and the to ta l of them is nothing to b rag about—
are from priv ate citizens, a voluntary recognition of a
debt, a personal hom age to a brave people. N othing com ­
parable to the single a ct of official recognition th a t the
nation of F rance gave to us w hen we w ere fig h tin g for
existence! W e are neutral! This quarrel, our president
declares, is in no sense our quarrel; we are not concerned
except to keep our trad e relations undisturbed by the w ar.
If F rance had taken th a t attitu d e during our revolution
there would very likely have been no U nited S tates of
A m erica. Is it surprising, then, th a t the French are
puzzled and ask them selves w h at sort of liberty we care
fo r over here, w h at has become of the old ideal fo r w hich
w e risked all ? The m eagerest recognition by our govern­
m ent of the ju st cause for w hich F rance is bleeding would
have been of im m easurably m ore help to th e F rench th an
all the gifts of hospitals and supplies and volunteer w ork
th a t the A m erican republic h as thus fa r unofficially of­
fered. No w onder our veterans unite in despising th is
generation!”
“G erald,” she addresses him w eakly w hile her large-
blue eyes look sadly into his. “W hen I am gone, you’ll gd
to F rance and help repay the debt w hich w e still owe her.’'
“B ut you’re not going to die,” he answ ers depfdc&t*
ingly, w hile a lum p rises in his th ro at.
“The P russians have m urdered me w ith the conniv­
ance of an A m erican m an-of-w ar, actin g upon in stru c­
tions from the P resident of the U nited S tates. W as there
ever a P resident called W ashington?” she ask s w istfully.
“W e are his descendants,” he says reg retfu lly b u t not
w ithout a slight tinge of pride in his low voice.
“Then if you are a W ashington, you w ill pay your
country’s debts.”
“I ’ll go to F ran ce!”
“I know you will, dear G erald. W hat w e owe we
m ust repay, even if it costs blood. Did G eorge W ashing­
ton refuse to shed his blood?”
“He w as not too proud to fig h t.”
“If he had sw orn to hold the slayers of his com patri­
ots to a stric t accountability, would he have kep t his
w o rd ?”
“H e never told a lie.”
“G erald, you are a W ashington, and his sp irit will
follow you to F rance.”
She pauses fo r breath. The exertion and intensity
of feeling have been too m uch for h er w aning strength.
“G erald, I ’m so tired. W on’t you call m other, d e a r? ”
He looks a t her affrighted, and then hurries on to the
veranda w here several o ther m em bers of th e fam ily are
gathered.
G eraldine’s m other, a w hite haired m atron of alm ost
sixty, hastens to the side of h er daughter and places her
arm tenderly round her head. B rothers and sisters and
friends also step reverently into the cham ber and w ith
bated breath g ath er round th e bed.
“Don’t talk, honey,” pleads her m other. “I t tires and
excites you.”
B ut G eraldine ram bles on:
“H e’s not too proud to fight. To F rance, F rance, to
avenge m y m urder. H e’s not too . . . .”
H er head tu rn s feebly to the bosom th a t gave h er
suck, h er eyes are closed.
She is dead.
CHAPTER 7
The w ar betw een F rance and G erm any still dragged
along. G erm any of course had been em asculated by the
g re a t w ars and occupancy by th e g reat powers. R ussia
and Poland still occupied p a rts of eastern G erm any and
P russia. I t w as only because of G erm any’s quick and
easy victory over Italy th a t G erm any w as able to p a r­
tially recover and w ithstand the French onslaught. G er­
m any had no g re a t generals experienced in actual w ar­
fare. T hey had all been liquidated a fter th e second w orld
w ar.
This w ar had not broken out in accordance w ith the
plans of A m erica. The w ar ag ain st Italy, yes, because it
had destroyed the progress of com m unism in Italy, and
strengthened the w estern b arrier ag ainst R ussia. B ut the
w ar betw een F rance and G erm any w as playing into the
hands of R ussia. So long as G erm any w as busy w ith
F rance, she could do nothing tow ard recovering h er east­
ern provinces from R ussia and Poland. The w eaker
w estern G erm any becam e, the g reater possibility of com ­
m unist eastern G erm any, w ith the help of R ussia and
Poland, invading w estern G erm any and spreading com­
m unism .
F rance of course w as strong, b u t divided into in­
num erable p arties, h er arm s had not been lim ited a fte r
the g re a t w ars, and she w as in possession of rich por­
tions of w estern G erm any. She m ight have been able to
overrun th e whole of w estern G erm any, b u t th a t would
have brought h er face to face w ith Russia, and brought
R ussia into the w ar, w hich A m erica w ished to avoid a t all
costs, a t least for the present until G erm any w as built
up. So A m erica and E ngland exerted all th eir pow er and
influence to check France.
If it had not been fo r the grow ing th re a t of the
com m unists tak in g over F rance, A m erica and E ngland
would not have perm itted G erm any to m ake w ar on
France.
Since the loss of India and E gypt, E ngland had
adopted a policy of w ithdraw ing troops from all outlying
possessions, cu ttin g down th e ruinous cost of h er m ilitary
establishm ent, and expanding com m ercially by peaceful
m eans—th e pohcy of G erm any before she undertook the
ruinous first w orld w ar. H er hold on India and E gypt
w as therefore m ore secure through com m erce th an it ever
had been by m ilitary occupation.
Jap an w as no longer a m enace to A m erica and G reat
B ritain who both com peted fo r her trade, b u t A m erica
w as now train in g m illions of Japanese in land, sea and
air tactics, though not supplying them w ith arm s and
m aterial, w hich w ere being accum ulated in the P hilip­
pines and on m andated islands. This of course w as in­
tended as a th re a t to com m unist provinces of China,
and principally as a d éterran t to Russia. All this seem ed
to be in contradiction to the policy of disarm am ent fol­
lowed a t home. B ut no one appeared to th in k there w as
anything inconsistent in follow ing different policies to ­
w ard the east and the w est, and giving m ilitary aid to
G erm any, Greece and Turkey.
-25—
Thus the w orld w as sittin g on a pow der keg, w ith
eyes cocked skyw ards for atom ic bom bs often hoaxed by
flying discs.
P resident H ighland showed signs of w eakening.
P ressure brought to b ear by P rice M orning acting for the
old stock A m ericans and for G reat B ritain, began to have
som e effect. G erm any w as w arned to avoid the A m eri­
can coast, and told th a t the sinking of an other A m erican
ship would be considered an unfriendly act. E ngland had
perm itted h er adventurous sons, especially F rench C an­
adians, to volunteer on th e w estern front, as the Poles in
th e U nited S tates had insisted on being shipped to the
eastern fro n t w here no hostilities w ere in progress, to off­
set the num ber of G erm an A m ericans sailing back to the
F atherland. E ngland w as also selling v a st quantities of
supplies to France.
The w ar had reached the stage of stalem ate. Count
F euerstab called on the vice-president.
“Mr. V ice-president, I reg ret th a t the friendship be­
tw een A m erica and G erm any seem s to have reached its
apogee,” began C ount F euerstab as soon as they w ere
alone.
“I w ould not say th a t, Excellency,” replied R othkopf.
“The A m erican people are indifferent about the present
conflict, all they desire is profit and high w ages. B ut
there is M orning and E ngland—they are spending vast
sum s on publicity and endeavoring to create prejudice
ag ain st th e F atherland. If it w ere not for these influ­
ences the G erm ans in A m erica would be able to enlist all
necessary sym pathy. T h at would be n atu ral for there
are no F rench in the U nited S tates.”
“B ut th ere are still m any Poles, Mr. V ice-president.”
“T h at is tru e,” answ ered R othkopf, “but if the F a th ­
erland announced th a t it w as w illing to sign a peace
tre a ty w ith Poland provided no Polish corridor to split
G erm any w ere dem anded, th is Polish agitation could be
stopped. The Poles are too poor to desire w ar. I would
be glad to act as peacem aker, Excellency.”
“T h at is w orth considering, R othkopf,” said the Count
adopting a m ore fam iliar tone. “I w ill m ake th e sugges­
tion. B ut w h at is to be done about P rice M orning and
G reat B rita in ? ”
“If I were president, I should know w hat to do,” w as
th e equivocal reply.
T here w as a long silence during w hich the tw o men
eyed each other furtively. Then th e C ount spoke:
“W hy can’t you be president? H ighland is not popu­
la r w ith E ngland or w ith the republicans. If he w ere
assassinated, they would n o t reg ret him, and they could
be accused.”
“B ut I w ouldn’t be any m ore popular th an H ighland.
No one would believe th a t E ngland or the republican
p a rty would like to place me in the W hite H ouse.”
“T h at is true, b u t y et H olland becam e president
w hen E agle w as assassinated,” urged the Count. “O yster-
linni should blam e H ighland for th e defeat of Italy, or a t
least I have heard th e Italian s in A m erica have been
urg in g O ysterlinni to tak e revenge not only for th eir de­
fe a t but fo r the suppression of th eir attem p ts to blow
up G erm an property and m urder G erm an sym pathizers.
Mexico is our friend, w e could count on her to protect
O ysterlinni.”
“There m ay be som ething to these rum ors you have
heard, Excellency, b u t com ing as they do from Mexico I
should not place too m uch reliance on them . Mexico m ay
be G erm any’s friend a t present, b u t she is not an enem y
of th e U nited S tates despite some differences about oil
leases. H ighland’s dem ise a t this tim e would n o t help us.
F irst it would be necessary to discredit E ngland and Price
M orning. E ngland has gathered over a million veterans
in Canada, h er m unition factories are w orking day and
night. W all S treet is talk in g about cu ttin g w ages all
around—m iners, steel w orkers, railroad men. The people
m ust be told th a t W all S treet intends to bring E nglish
troops in to prevent a general strike, th a t A m erican m an­
u factu rers w ant cheap m unitions to sell to F rance. A
general strik e could be engineered and th a t would be an
excuse fo r O ysterlinni’s gunm en to become active. D ur­

“F or instance, the B eerbibbers m ight be arm ed,” sug­
gested the C ount firm ly; “and once in possession of w ar

T heir respective stations in life m ade M aud M orning
and P aul Fidus not indifferent to the events th a t w ere
shaping around them . M aud identified w ith the w orld’s
param ount plutocracy, P aul th e m outhpiece of A m erican
paupers, seem ed to stand a t opposite poles of the social
order. True, the poor of th e U nited S tates w ere not the
m ost ab ject on earth, y et w hen contrasted w ith the rich
of th eir own country, they stood in an tith etical positions.
A ccordingly these tw o often clashed in th eir views of life.
"The L ast D ays of the republic are im m inent,” w as a
favorite phrase of Paul, and he repeated it again th is day.
“N onsense,” replied M aud, “you’re a crepe-hanger.
You see only the one side of our national life, the poor,
the dissatisfied, the unfortunate, the crim inal, and you
th in k the country is going to the dogs.”
“You are m istaken, M aud. I happen to be in a posi­
tion w here I can see both sides, you know th at. T h at is
w hy I am able to judge.”
“You have only theories,” reto rted M aud, “you have
no actu al evidence.”
“There are trends, and if you w ish I will show them
to you.”
“I ’d like to see them , b u t no m ore slum m ing. I know
all about th a t.”
“All right, M aud. P u t on some plain things, and I ’ll
show you.”
M aud disappeared fo r a few m om ents. W hen she
reappeared she w as dressed in a sim ple w alking su it th a t
m atched h er brow n eyes and hair. P aul could not help
adm iring her, and she susceptible, blushed and asked:
“I t ’s Scotch, it’s th e sim plest th in g I have. W on’t it
d o ?”
“Yes, it’ll do, T h at’s not w hat I w as thinking about.
I w as stru ck by the perfect color schem e, the tweed, your
hair, and your eyes.”
The roses in M aud’s face deepened.
“K idder!” and she hastened to the door.
A s they w alked along F ifth Avenue, he resum ed:
“See the kind of president and vice-president we elect
now adays. They favor sham elessly th eir own parties to
the detrim ent of the nation a t large. H ighland prom pted
by R othkopf is playing into the hands of G erm any, R oth­
kopf in control of the law -m aking m achinery has m ade
prohibition a dead letter.”
“W hy don’t you run fo r president. I guarantee you’ll
be elected. B ut you’re of foreign extraction yourself,”
interrupted M aud slyly.
“T h at does not m ake me less an A m erican,” w as the
quick reto rt. “The fath ers of both of us cam e across.
W ashington and R oosevelt did not favor their ancestral
hom es w hen th e w elfare of A m erica w as a t stake.”
“B ut the people elected H ighland and R othkopf.”
“No, th ey didn’t. The m achine elected them , m oney
elected them .”
“You don’t m ean to say we elected th e m ? ” dem anded
M aud.
“No, not our money, b u t m oney. The convention nom ­
inated H ighland. The people had nothing to do w ith the
nom ination. W ithout money, and the press and politic­
ians th a t m oney buys, no m an can be nom inated. No
poor m an can go straig h t to the people. R othkopf got
onto the tick et because G erm any and the B eerbibbers
supplied the funds of the cam paign. M ost people are too
ignorant to “scratch ” or split th eir votes, they vote a
stra ig h t tick et; the stra ig h t vote p u t R othkopf into of­
fice. Besides th ere w as no w ay to elim inate R othkopf.
M any dem ocrats w anted H ighland, b u t not R othkopf. To
g et H ighland in. they had to vote fo r the p arty president
and the p a rty vice-president. They couldn’t do otherw ise
fo r H ighland and R othkopf w ere the only candidates. I t
w as H obson’s choice. A nd it alw ays will be so until can­
didates are nom inated by direct vote of the people w ith ­
out a direct prim ary. One day if an accident happens
R othkopf m ay be president, though the v ast m ajo rity of
the people do not w an t him . W e should have the recall.”
“H olland becam e president w hen E agle w as assassin­
ated.” suggested Maud, “and he didn’t m ake such a bad
president although he w as ag ain st us.”
“The cases are not identical. H olland w as the choice
of the people. If we took a vote of the people today, H ol­
land would again be president. T hen H olland is n o t a
crook.”

“In ferrin g th a t R othkopf is a cro o k ?”
“You know b etter th an I w h at he is.”
They entered a m en’s clothing store. T housands of
m en w ere preening them selves before m irrors, selecting
ties, different styles of h ats, suits, etc. E norm ous sum s
w ere being spent on every conceivable article, nylon socks,
fancy shoes, perfum ed handkerchiefs, gloves, jew elry.
The variety w as astounding— different costum es for v a­
rious occasions, tennis, golf, polo, dancing, bathing, m orn­
ing-, evening-, afternoon-, dinner-suits; w inter overcoats,
spring coats, rain coats, dust coats; stacks and stacks
of sh irts of every conceivable cu t and color, soft sport
shirts, evening dress sh irts; union suits fo r w inter, sum ­
m er, spring and fall, of silk, cotton, rayon, wool, linen,
spun-glass, and num erous new synthetics.
To one side w as th e barb er shop, or H andsom e P a r­
lor as it w as then nam ed. H ere sybarites were being
m anicured by painted girls, sham pooed, m assaged, spend­
ing a day’s earnings on toilet requisites.
“Is this an o th er tre n d ? ” inquired M aud facetiously.
“M ost of th is is inane luxury, characteristic of a n a­
tion in its decline.”
“B ut doesn’t it keep m oney in circulation, p erm it the
rich to spend, and the poor to e a rn ? ”
“I t does and th a t’s its condem nation. I t is the object
fo r w hich m oney is spent th a t counts, not th e m ere act
of spending. M oney can be spent in corruption, in vice
and sloth, and as these m en are spending it. The lives
of m any of these m en are passed in th is w ay, th is is for
w h at they live and devote th eir heritag es or earnings.
This is the ideal of the m ajority of our young men.
“A s to the poor earning, hardly any of these girls
behind the counters or in th e H andsom e P arlo r earn suf­
ficient w ages to feed and clothe them selves as th ey are
h abituated to dine and dress. M ost of them sell th eir
bodies. The poor through exam ple and tem ptation are
m ade as bad as th e rich.”
“B ut it’s alw ays been so,” urged M aud. “They like it,
th ey w an t to do it. You can’t stop them .”
“No, it w asn’t alw ays so. L uxury is m ore excessive
and m ore sham eless now th a n it ever w as. A t th e sam e
tim e w e have poverty as abject as it w as in the la st cen­
tury, and m en and w om en who through com pulsory edu­
cation, facilities for observation and opportunities for
com parison, have been m ade conscious of th eir inferior
sta te and ready to m ake w ealth th eir own by any m eans.”
They left th e store, and P au l beckoned to a taxi. As
th ey drove along, both w ere silent, she endeavoring to
g rasp his point of view, he absorbed in his own reflec­
tions. She knew th a t he spent no m onev on him self,
gave everything aw ay in charity. W hen th e E a st Side
cam e into view, she spoke suddenly:
“I thought there w as to be no slum m ing.”
A w akened from his reverie, he looked out of the w in­
dow and seem ed surprised to note th eir w hereabouts. A
w ord to the chauffeur and he turned to her, apologetical­
ly-
“I am tak in g you to another store; the chauffeur
took a short cut.”
In a m om ent they h alted before a w orkingm an’s
store and entered. P aul looked around in expectancy,
then he led his com panion to a counter w here a laborer
and his wife stood bargaining. U nobserved they listened
until th e laborer bought a second-hand su it for $8, his
old su it being tak en in exchange fo r $2; and his wife
bought a second-hand dress for $4 and some coarse dress
m aterial. A t th is juncture P aul turned hastily aw ay ta
avoid recognition, and th ey hurried to th eir taxi.
“I know th a t m an,” explained P au l as soon as they
w ere on th eir w ay again. “All he possesses, he has on his
back. He has no other clothes, neither has his wife. They
and th eir three children live in an old wooden shack.
T hey sleep in one room. The oldest child, a daughter,
w orks in a departm ent store w here w e are going now. He
is a stre e t cleaner, h is.salary is $25 a week. H is daugh­
te r’s salary is half th at. T hey get by, b u t none of them
is satisfied. June, the daughter, w as forced by our benev­
olent governm ent to go to high school. There she learn ­
ed loose sexual relations, or equality w ith the m ale sex as
the m odern bobbysoxer term s it, to sm oke, to drink, to
atten d cabarets, shows, dance-halls, to dine and dress be­
yond the m eans of h er parents. She’s not a bad girl, as
girls go now adays, she sim ply does w h at th e m ajority of
her class do, and sees no evil in it, neith er do her parents.
They g et out of life all th e pleasure they can. N atu rally
she’s not satisfied w ith her home, the food eaten a t home,
the clothing w orn a t home, and she stay s aw ay from
home as m uch as possible. If she did n o t love her folks,
she w ould leave home. The p aren ts are dissatisfied be­
cause through th eir d aughter they h ear constantly of an ­
other existence and w ith her share in discontent th eir
presen t mode of life w hich they have only the hankering
b u t not the ability or opportunity to forsake. T here is
nothing dishonorable in his .work------ it is the g re a t di­
v ersity betw een him self and our sham eless luxury that
has m ade him a pessim ist and a recru it to every labor
agitation. Com m unism or socialism would not im prove
his lot, in fa c t it would m ake it worse, fo r he w ould earn
less, have a no b e tter home, and less opportunity to en­
joy the m om ents of leisure and pleasure he now has. This
is a fa ir specim en of our city laboring class (unionized by
th e w ay) if th ey do not happen to belong to certain spe­
cialized trades. They are ready to obey any dem agogue
who advocates the overthrow of our present order.”
“D uring and a fte r the w orld w ars th e w orking classes
earned enorm ous w ages. W hy have w ages gone down,
w hy can’t they be raised, w hy can’t w ork be supplied fo r
everybody, w hy should th ere be so m uch unem ploym ent ?
Surely som ething can be done about it. W hy don’t you
do i t ? ” said Maud.
“You know I have done and am doing all I can. I
have urged the sharing of profits, the annual w age, pen­
sions, and every form of insurance, financed independent­
ly of the governm ent, by em ployer and employee am ong
them selves. M any have seen th e light, but still m ost w alk
in darkness. A nd do not fo rg et th a t it w as during the
era of high w ages and m ass em ploym ent th a t com m un­
ism and socialism took hold of this country. E ngland
w ith her socialism and R ussia w ith h er com m unism are
still m uch w orse off then we are, though we are bad
enough. None of these ism s will solve th e problem . You
know w h at I th in k the solution is, because you have read
all m y books, listened to all m y speeches, for a num ber
of years.”.
They had arrived a t one of the forem ost departm ent
stores. M aud w ondering w hy she had been brought to a
place w ith w hich she w as thoroughly fam iliar, but su r­
m ising th a t the visit bore som e relation to the excursions
to the other stores, sm iled and sim ply said:
“A nother tren d !”
They had g re a t difficulty in m oving along—the
crow ds of women being unusually inconsiderate. D ressed
in the latest fashions, sk irts of thin tra n sp a re n t m aterial
ending above the knees, sleeveless w ith backs and bosom s
bare, fan tastic h ats perked on th eir heads, each seem ed
bent on jostling the others uncerem oniously out of her
w ay.
They halted m idw ay betw een the underw ear and the
corset departm ents. W hile a num ber of m en took in the
spectacle, w om en tried on the various articles of a ttire
M any bought, often paying ex traordinary sum s fo r the
luxurious articles, b u t m any m ore m erely tried them on.
P aul looked a t M aud questioningly.
“D on’t you see here some of th e reasons fo r th e p res­
ent sta te of the w orld? D on’t you see anything w rong
here ?”
“No, Paul, I can’t say th a t I do. W hat’s w rong w ith
th is tre n d ? ”
“I t ’s strik in g co n trast to the last store, the tim e and
m oney being w asted here, and the fa c t th a t th is is a
rendezvous for a g re a t num ber of persons seeking illicit
relations. M any w om en come to buy w h at they need,
b u t m any m ore come to buy w hat they do not need. Then
g reat num bers have no intention of buying or have not
the m oney to buy. They fritte r aw ay th eir own tim e
and the tim e of the shop girls. They gloat over things
beyond th eir m eans, im agine them selves o ther th an they
are, develop irratio n al desires, a neurosis of d is s a tis fa c ­
tion w ith th eir present lot. Innum erable wives and
m others spend th eir tim e here, instead of atten d in g ^o
th eir household duties. Then m any of these w om en
come here m erely to expose th eir bodies to the m en
standing around.”
“Well, w ould you close the d epartm ent stores,” in­
quired M aud,” or place a policem an a t the door to p re­
vent these w om en from en te rin g ? ”
“No,” replied Paul, “I do n o t pretend th a t I am able
to change these tra its of hum an action. I claim only th a t
these things show w here we are going. W hat you see
here you see in London and Moscow, in Tokyo and Cal­
cu tta, and w ould have seen the sam e in ancient Jerusalem
and in ancient Home. N either M arx n or S talin have
changed it one iota, and never will. M an does n o t live
by bread alone!
“D aily the num ber of dissatisfied persons increase,
w hile the m eans to satisfy th eir desires decrease. I
know it w as n o t alw ays so. There w as a tim e w hen the
w ealth per cap ita increased, but now w ealth is being con­
cen trated into few er hands, into the palm s of m ore favor­
ed officials in R ussia, w ages are being cut every year,
w hile the cost of living is going up because of th e g re a t­
er luxury and unchecked b irth -rate. T h at is w hy I de­
plore today the things we are w itnessing.”
They strolled tow ard th e beauty d epartm ent w hich
w as exposed to public view as w as the H andsom e P arlo r
they had visited earlier in the day. T here had been a
tim e in the history of th e nation w hen w om en attended
to th eir toilet in th e seclusion of th eir boudoirs, b u t w hen
th ey began to bob th eir h a ir and patronize m en’s barber
shops, th ey gradually em ancipated them selves until
beauty parlors becam e v irtually public dressing-room s.
There they saw w om en spending fortunes to have
th eir faces lifted, th eir noses altered, th eir busts develop­
ed, th eir hollow cheeks puffed, every p a rt of th eir bodies
changed to su it th eir vacuous fancies. T here w ere w rinkle
eradicators, skin blanchers, m asseurs, and m asseuses,
m anicurists; h air dyers, h air dressers, h air depilators; a
doctor who tre a te d the eyes w ith belladonna. The counter
did a th riving trad e in cosm etics, pow der, paint, pencil,
and a thousand nostrum s guaranteed to beautify th e m ost
beautyless.
“The quest of beauty is not an evil in itself,” com­
m ented Paul, “It is the van ity of th is artificial beauty,
the base purposes w hich m uch of it is m ade to serve,
and the m oney and tim e th a t is spent on this counterfeit
article, m oney th a t can often be ill-spared, m oney th a t
deprives the spender and h er dependents of dire necessi­
ties and precious opportunities of life.”
They em erged from the throng and sauntered down
B roadw ay. A sign above a church a ttra c te d th eir a t­
tention:
“A dance will be given here to n ig h t to fu rth e r the
Kingdom of God.”
“Shall we e n te r? ” suggested Paul.
“No, n o t now. O ur shopping expedition has tired
me. L et’s go to the p ark. P erhaps w e m ay re tu rn later,
if this is another of your trends.”
A s they w alked he talked:
“There is no possibility of avoiding the im pending
doom of our so-called civilization. The germ of destruc­
tion is contained in all our daily doings. The press, our
literatu re, all our publications avoid facing reality. All
our pictures, plays, am usem ents, are m erely shots in th>
arm to deaden consideration and realization of th e facts
of life. E verything and everybody is alw ays attending
som e am usem ent, hardly one a funeral. V ery few are
the m ourners.
“O ur publications are clever, entertaining, in stru c­
tive, b u t as soon as you have read one, you are reads
fo r th e next, crave another shot in th e arm , like the
chain sm oker. The effect of all our literatu re, books
and publications is evanescent, dope to deaden the facul­
ties. O ur movies, our th eatres are operated for the sam e
obfuscating purpose, in con trast to th e tragedies of the
classical world, w hich clearly foresaw its doom.
“No publisher, no producer, w ill consider anything
th a t encourages th e contem plation of disease, death and
the grave, w ritten to m ake a perm anent im pression on
the world, unless w ith th e added adm onition: E at, drink
and be m erry, fo r tom orrow we m ay die!”
How tr u e ! E ven today our regular channels of public­
ity would never issue anything as crude as th is book
w hich know s nothing about the law s of literatu re, style,
unity, com position. Intentionally or unintentionally it
ignores or b reaks every rule of w riting, every law of book
m aking. Does not even tak e th e trouble to cor­
re c t the proofs. I t is not a w ork of art, w as not w rit­
ten fo r the lite ra ti nor the cognoschenti, b u t fo r him who
runs to read, as it w as w ritten w hile I ran.
M erely the outpourings of an unlettered savage,
naked as nature, w ithout palliative m ake-up; cast
out of the jungle into your civilization of w orld
w ars one, tw o and three, and th eir interludes; your
literary civilization of the countrym en of Shakespeare
still running tru e to the anti-sem itic Shylock; the coun­
trym en of G oethe still selling th eir F au stian souls to the
devil; and both of them akin in th eir cultured purpose of
blow ing the earth to hell, and crucifying six m illion de­
scendants of th e authors of the Bible, in infernal concen­
tratio n cam ps, even in th eir own Prom ised Palestine!
B ut such a m an can w rite a g re a t book w ithout be­
ing able to spell, w ithout any know ledge of gram m ar,
syntax, etc., a m an can compose beautiful m usic w ithout
being able to read a note, a m an can heal the sick w ithout
a day’s schooling, even as a m an can be a g re a t c ra fts­
m an w ithout belonging to any union.
P au l continued his conversation developing the sam e
th em e:
“The m ost convincing evidence of our decadence is
th e contem porary disintegration of th e B ritish E m pire
now in her death throes. The oldest of our m odern civil­
izations fights heroically to keep H itler from h er doors,
and no sooner is H itler destroyed th a n she tu rn s round
and adopts his m ost d astardly w eapon, the persecution of
th e Jew s. B u t th is is only one of h er vagaries. H er so-
called socialist regim e (really trad e unionism ) is the an­
tithesis of all th e deeds th a t m ade E ngland great,
w rought the M agna C harta, elected the m other of p arlia­
m ents, proclaim ed tolerance, freedom of religion, free­
dom of the press, freedom of speech; m ade her a refuge
fo r the persecuted of all lands and all religions, th e pro­
tag o n ist of priv ate and personal enterprise and posses­
sions, of th e individual rig h ts and initiatives of m an.”
E ven as P au l’s thoughts ra n several years hence, so
our own experience today brings up a sim ilar picture.
I see no hope for our civilization. H um anity is dis­
eased, physically, m entally and spiritually. The trends
P au l m entioned do not exhaust all th e evidence. W hat
is the use of th e so-called F o u r Freedom s, w hen the basic
freedom s have been nullified ? L et us tak e the follow ing
freedom s, all basic for an enduring civilization:
Freedom of M igration, Freedom to E arn a Living,
Freedom to H ealth, Freedom from Monopoly.
W hen the w orld w as young, peoples w ere free to m i­
g ra te w herever and w henever they w ere able, w ithout
artificial law s. A m erica w as built up by em igration,
cross-breeding, the courage and initiative of the pioneer.
N ow the w orld is condem ned to overpopulation in certain
areas w hile v a st continents rem ain underpopulated, birth-
control w here b irth s would be desirable, no birth-control
w here b irths are undesirable; an uncontrolled interbreed­
ing w ithin national borders, in co n trast to a so-called con­
trolled civilization. Peoples are not even perm itted to
em igrate to th eir ancient homes, b u t are segregated w ith ­
in ghettos and exterm ination cam ps, as they w ere in G er­
m any, and as they still are by G reat B ritain. D estroy­
ing a civilized people in a half-em pty world! Of course
I refer to the Jew s.
A re the Jew s who seek to en ter P alestine crim inals ?
Only a scoundrel would hold such a view. N ot the Jew s
are crim inals b u t th e A rabs and B ritish who m urder them
and prevent th eir entry into th eir ancient land, are the
crim inals. The m en and w om en who try to en ter A m eri­
ca or any o ther land for th e purpose of earning an honest
living are not crim inals. Those who prevent such a t­
tem p ts are th e real crim inals, selfish and short-sighted
fools opposing th e n atu ral evolution of hum anity along
ratio n al lines. The law, the governm ent, the lobbies
crim inalize honest people w hen they fru stra te the inalien­
able rig h t of every hum an being to move freely about the
ea rth in search of an honest livelihood.
No nation has the m oral rig h t or the scientific
know ledge to judge and decide w hich peoples should be
condem ned to death. H ave th e A rabs done m ore for the
w orld th an the Jew s? W ill civilization be safer in the
keeping of an A rab w orld ? Did God g ra n t to the A rabs
a deed in perp etu ity to P alestin e? W ill the A rabs in
P alestine be b e tte r off by excluding the Jew s? No, only
a few rich A rabs will again be given the pow er to enslave
the m asses.
“The land is m ine,” saith th e Lord. The whole earth
should be throw n open to m igration and cross-breeding,
especially in Palestine, A ustralia, C anada, g reat areas
in A sia, A frica and A m erica, w here the soil is calling for
population.
If a sane and healthy hum anity is to evolve, this m ust
— 28—
be done. Of course I have not in m ind the shiftless,
crim inal, or diseased m em bers of a race, but the superior
m em bers who are the equals of any race, and are now
being exterm inated to the detrim ent of hum anity.
Freedom to E arn a Living is nullified not only by th e
above-m entioned em igration law s, w hich prevent millions
of honest w orkers from seeking the spots on the earth
w here they could earn a living by th eir labor, b u t this
freedom is also nullified by m any artificial monopolies.
All unions and professional licensing law s are designed
for the protection of certain privileged classes, and to
crim inalize m illions of honest people.
E very union, w hen it tries to prevent honest people
from earning a living is engaged in a crim inal offense.
The unions m ay call him a “scab”, m ay “slug” him to
death; picket or strik e ag ain st the em ployer who hires
him , b u t the fact rem ains th a t the union, abetted by the
law, is the crim inal in God’s eyes, w hereas the “scab” is
th e honest m an. Therefore the open shop should not be
crim inalized by the law, b u t should on the contrary be
legalized by the law.
The so-called Socialist (trade-union) governm ent now
in pow er in England, w hich is responsible for the m urder
of Jew ish p atriots, I class as crim inal, not m uch b etter
th a n Bolshevism . T heir acts in Palestine, and the ruin
to w hich they have brought England, are sufficient evi­
dence of this thesis.
H um anity m ust learn to distinguish betw een m en
and ideas. Socialism and Com m unism m ay be w onderful
ideas in theory, b u t they have to be executed by men,
and as soon as you place th e ir execution in the hands of
men, you build up by th eir n atu re a ty ran n y th a t de­
stroys every essential rig h t of man.
In a sim ilar class are all the professional unions,
bolstered by lobbies and engineered law s. There w as a
tim e w hen any m an w as free to plead a cause before a
judge or jury. Now he m ust be a grad u ate of a certain
school, conform to certain rules of th e L aw yers’ M onop­
oly.. N atu rally I am not decrying education and tra in ­
ing. I am only deploring th e exclusion, exterm ination,
crim inalizing of th e innum erable geniuses who have not
been able, through poverty, race or other causes, to place
a t th e service of hum anity g ifts w hich are equal and often
superior to those of the privileged and licensed classes.
E very genius is not a child prodigy. The divine a f­
flatu s m ay strik e in middle age, or even in old age, w hen
it is too late to pass through all the prelim inary b u t often
unessential processes of our educational assem bly-line.
P overty, race, lack of opportunity, b irth in backw ard
lands, m ay also have prevented the acquisition of such
prelim inaries. M ust such valuable m aterial be for ever
cast on the junk pile?
Consider in th is connection th a t C harles L. McCuen,
head of GM L aboratories, is not a college graduate.
In th is country, diplom as and degrees in m illions of
cases do not alw ays signify intrinsic ability. O ur schools,
prim ary, secondary, colleges, universities, are sim ilar to
assem bly-lines w hich pass through unselective conveyors
autom atically m illions of inefficient, ignorant, ch aracter­
less m aterial w hich in no sense can be com pared to the
n a tu ra l capacity and m erit th a t is forced to go to w aste
for the above shortsighted and a t the sam e tim e discrim ­
inative and indiscrim inative reasons.
This brings us to w h at I call the Freedom to H ealth.
E very m an who attem p ts to m inister to the sick is prose­
cuted as a crim inal unless he has graduated from a cer­
tain school, belongs to a certain association, and has ob­
tained a certain license. O ur C onstitution envisaged
freedom to practice any of the healing arts, our C hristian
religion authorized it by the exam ple of Jesus and his
A postles, yet any m an WI19 attem p ts to exercise this
n atu ral rig h t is judged a crim inal. H e is no m ore a
crim inal th an Jesus w as a crim inal. I t is those who
judge him who are the crim inals. Of course I have in
m ind honest m en and w om en who have a n atu ral or self-
acquired g ift to heal th e sick by m ethods and m eans th ey
have tried and studied in th eir own w ay.
If hum anity w as n o t physically and m entally sick
and deteriorating from day to day, if the licensed m edical
profession w ere able to cure the increasing num ber of
the m entally and physically sick, there would be some
justification fo r g ran tin g a monopoly to a certain union,
but all our diseases, cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, etc.,
are still tak in g th eir toll in m illions of deaths. And
— 29
usually it is only the failures of the licensed profession
th a t ever reach the unlicensed or unorothodox healers.
N ot only are certain m en given a m onopoly w hich is
not justified by the continuing sickness of hum anity,
physical and m ental, but certain m ethods and certain
drugs are gran ted monopolies not justified by results.
T ake the one item of insulin. I t has been g ran ted p rac­
tically a monopoly in the tre a tm e n t of diabetes, and all
attem p ts to advocate some o ther form of m edication is
considered crim inal. Y et w e know th a t m illions of dia­
betics find relief w ithout insulin, and even some of the
outstanding authorities have discounted the value of
insulin. The A P recently stated th a t a N ew Y ork phy­
sician asserted th a t early optim ism on control of diabetes
w ith insulin w as “now becom ing dissipated,” th a t under
present m ethods of tre a tm e n t victim s can not escape
progressive dam age to the blood vessels.
Of 200 diabetic p atien ts studied a t M ount Sinai
H ospital, N ew York, said D r. H enry D olger in the Journal
of the A m erican M edical A ssociation, not one escaped
retin al (eye) hem orrhage— regardless of age of onset,
severity of the disease or m ethod of treatm en t.
“I t m akes little difference how th e diabetic is
treated ; if he lives long enough, he w ill develop one or
an other form of vascular disease,” he concluded.
The above is only a single exam ple, b u t considered
in conjunction w ith the m any other diseases and the
rapid grow th of psychiatry, there cannot be any doubt
th a t hum anity is degenerating physically and m entally.
Then consider the hundreds of thousands of deaths
soon to be caused by atom bom b m utations. In the course
of tim e this m ay resu lt in the genetic dying out of m ore
people th a n the population of th e earth a t any one tim e.
There seem s to be an etern al w ar betw een the m ind
or soul and nature, in o ther w ords betw een sp irit and
m atter. The spiritual is constantly striv in g to m ake
itself independent of the m aterial, but it is only a m a tte r
of tim e w hen n atu re will destroy the whole of hum anity.
T h at is w hy I say th a t the present evolution of hum anity
is doomed.
In line w ith the above monopolies are the ta riff w alls
and duty frontiers. The franchises g ran ted to utilities,
th e p aten ts th a t are suppressed in th e in terests of certain
m anufacturers, the tru sts and cartels th a t enrich the few
a t the expense of the m any, and crim inalize those who
try to bring about a freer world. F ree trad e m ade E n g ­
land great.
Is it not possible th a t th is protecting and pam per­
ing of the few is th e cause of all our labor troubles, our
national and international w ars, and th a t Freedom from
M onopolies is one of the basic rem edies for w orld u n rest ?
H um anity is sick, physically, m entally, spiritually.
G erm any and Jap an gave evidence of th eir spiritual sick­
ness during W orld W ar Two. E ngland followed in th eir
steps by persecuting the Jew s and subm itting to a de­
generate form of governm ent. A m erica through th re a t
of R ussia is compelled to tak e the sam e dow nw ard p ath
th a t leads to physical, m ental, and spiritual decay.

L et us revert:
I t w as a w arm evening, the p ark and its pools w ere
crowded. Men and women, in tru n k s or tig h t-fittin g ny­
lon suits, w hich exposed m ore th an they hid, com peted
ag ain st each other, or ^disported them selves in the w ater
or on th e sand. Some of the m en w ore nothing b u t loin
clothes, in fact th ere seem ed to be no restrictions as to
w hat one could w ear or not w ear. L ying around w ere
couples em bracing each other unconcerned about the rest
of the world. E m pty bottles w hich obviously had con­
tained intoxicating liquors, filled the garbage cans.
“A re you h u n g ry ? ” inquired Paul.
“Yes, I feel like a hot dog,” she said gaily.
“W ould you object to th a t place over th e re ? ” he
asked pointing to an alfresco dancing pavillion.
“No, it’d be fun. O r perhaps you have som e ulterior
m otive,” she added quickly, “a dan ce?”
“No, M aud, I w asn’t th inking of th a t ju s t now. I
w ouldn’t ask you to dance in such a place. The fa c t is,
th is is an other of the trends th a t show w here w e are
going.”
She seem ed to be disappointed, but her mood quickly
changed as th ey entered a room behind the counter.
There dancing w as also in progress, b u t w h at dancing!
W hile an alm ost nude burlesque show w as presented on
the stage, in th e body of the room intoxicated couples
sim ilarly clad or unclad, m ingled in im m oral dances,
laughed a t th e suggestive or dow nright obscene jokes,
em ptied glasses of liquor w hich th ey bought openly at
th e counter. The place reeked w ith sm oke and alcohol.
“I can’t e at here,” said M aud in disgust. ‘T v e seen
and heard enough. L et’s g et out into th e fresh air. I
didn’t know th is w as perm itted, especially in our p ark s.”
“I t’s ag ain st the le tte r of th e law ,” explained Paul
apologetically, “b u t th is place is protected. No police­
m an would raid it. If a charge w as laid, a sm all fine
or bribe would settle the m atter.”
They bought th eir sandw iches and w ent out to a
p ark bench to eat. The m oon w as shining palely, the
hum of bipeds im pressed them according to th eir respec­
tive tem peram ents. To the one it m eant the w hispering
of love, legitim ate, unalloyed, secret only through conven­
tion. To the o ther it signified the tem ptation of carnal­
ity, illegitim ate, tainted, secret through fear. Thus do
all things affect different souls differently, and cause
m en to differ in th eir estim ates of th e sam e object. To
one th e w orld is infinitely good; to another, infinitely bad.
Y et it is one and th e sam e w orld, and it seem s to evolve
independent of hum an estim ates. Seems only, fo r n atu re
is modified, though im perceptibly, by reason.
CHAPTER 8
W e have been accorded an insight into th e lives and
plans of various hum an beings. W e know th a t th e w orld
is pursuing its course above a rum bling volcano. W hile
we are on the brink of the abyss, before all our characters
are engulfed, as so m any of us are in th e m idst of life,
let us stop for another m om ent to consider som e details
th a t we have om itted or overlooked in our hurry.
P aul P etro v k a w as the son of a R ussian Jew . His
real nam e w as P aul Fidus or ra th e r Fidusky. H is fath er
had A m ericanized the nam e to Fidus. H e had a sister
nam ed A ngelica, about w hom we shall have som ething
m ore to say.
Fidus the elder w as a p a rtn e r of Lupus who had come
from E ngland and had changed his nam e to M orning
w hen he settled in N ew Y ork. I w ill a t the end of this
book tell the sto ry of the firm of L upus and Fidus.
Lupus w as m arried tw ice. H e had deserted his first
w ife Florence F airbanks, by whom he had a daughter
F lorida F airbanks, whose story I told a t the beginning
of th is book. The first M rs. Lupus had tak en h er m aiden
nam e a fte r her divorce, and a fte r L upus had changed his
nam e to M orning, the tw o fam ilies had lost contact w ith
each other. No one connected them w ith each o th er be­
cause both bore different nam es.
P rice Lupus by his second m arriage had three
daughters. T heir nam es w ere Lucille who th ey m erely
said had died, if anyone enquired; M ary, D uchess of Al­
bion; and M aud M orning whose story I reg ret ends
abruptly here, as does th a t of Paul. T hey w ere trapped
in “The D estruction of the W orld”, described in another
book. T hey are to us “Ships th a t passed in the n ig h t.”
The fa te of other m em bers of both fam ilies is told in
the follow ing chapter.
Com m unism or w h at w ent under th a t nam e had been
banned from the U nited S tates. T h at does not m ean
there w ere no C om m unists. The country w as satu rated
w ith them , and the m ost pow erful em bassy w as th a t of
Comm unism . The R ussian am bassador, G rim kowsky,
w as the m ost pow erful m an in th e U nited S tates. In his
hands centered th e strin g s th a t controlled strikes, w ages,
production, m unitions, w ar and peace.
The G erm ans believed th a t th ey w ere responsible for
th e w ave of pacificism th a t now sw ept over the U nited
States, b u t thev w ere m istaken. The R ussians not only
encom passed more, b u t knew more. F or instance,
G rim kow sky knew th a t E ngland had m assed over a m il­
lion troops in Canada, not to p ro tect th e U nited S tates
ag ain st R.ussia, as w as publicly declared; not to m ake up
for the w eakening of U nited S tates’ defences in A laska;
not to prepare and hold a fu tu re capital for the B ritish
E m pire in case London w ere destroyed and the royal
fam ily and cabinet had to flee to C anada; b u t to m arch
into the U nited S tates a t the bugle call of P rice M orning,
if the Com m unists, not th e Beerbibbers, should seize
power.
W hat w as th is Com m unism ?
I t w as a secret society, an esoteric sect, in A m erica,
specifically in C anada and the U nited S tates, th a t should
have been exterm inated m ercilessly. The term Com­
m unism is a m isnom er. A s the term Socialism w as ap­
plied to N azism to build up an anti-social m ilitarism , so
th e term Com m unism has been m isappropriated by Bol­
shevism to build up an anti-C om m unist dictatorship. Only
the im m ature, the inexperienced, are its converts. The
m ature, the experienced, are im m une. These fanatics do
not w ork fo r m oney, th ey w ork fo r an illusion, a delusion,
as did the C anadians who in th eir delusion betrayed their
own country to R ussia. There is no cure for such cases,
only exterm ination; as th ere is no possibility of com pro­
m ise w ith cynical B olshevists, only w ar.
W e m ust distinguish betw een the R ussian people and
the present B olshevik governm ent of R ussia. W e cannot
have peace w ith the Bolsheviks though w e can live in
peace w ith the R ussian peoples. W ar w ith the B olsheviks
is inevitable. W e m ust prepare for th a t w ar. A nd w hen
we fig h t th a t w ar, and destroy th e Bolshevik governm ent,
as we m ust and will, w e shall find a R ussian people
ready to live in peace w ith us. W e should declare openly
to the w orld and to the R ussian peoples th a t w e are de­
term ined to free R ussia from its B olshevik Czars.
If there ever w as a p acifist it w as Jesus. No one
desired peace m ore th an Jesus, y et he prophesied w ar.
T h at is m y own position. W e m ust face facts, reality,
th e inevitable. W e desire to live in peace w ith all peoples,
b u t there is no peace and cannot be betw een Bolshevism
and free men.
T here is an ideal Com m unism (I saw th a t m irage
m yself), th a t is dangled before the obfuscated brains of
th is secret society, th is esoteric sect, outside of R ussia.
This ideal Com m unism is not only a phantasy, b u t abso­
lutely im possible of realization, externalization; and if it
w ere realized, externalized, would lead only to th e de­
struction of civilization, th e extinction of hum anity.
This ideal Com m unism has not been realized, not
even approxim ated, in R ussia itself, and the dictato rs of
the Soviets know it b e tte r th an any one else on earth.
T heir argum ents th a t they have thus fa r been prevented
from attain in g the ideal Com m unism is m erely m endacity.
T hey have no intention of im posing Com m unism on the
world, th eir purpose is to enslave th e w orld, as they have
enslaved th e disillusioned R ussian people by fe a r and
force, to perpetuate th eir own ty ran n y and despotism ,
th eir own hegem ony. T hey are ruthless realists, un­
principled opportunists, and not a single one of them a t­
tem p ts to live th e life of an ideal Com m unist, though
th a t would be possible fo r them as individuals. They are
all, w ithout a single exception, ran k capitalists (speculat­
ing w ith public capital fo r personal p ro fit), unm itigated
individualists (egoists, eg o tists), cynical anti-C om m unists
(hypocrites).
There are m any co-travellers or ra th e r co-tourists in
A m erica of Com m unism and Russia, and Socialism. B ut
let us b ear in m ind th a t th ere is no Com m unism in R us­
sia, only Stalinism , Sovietism , Bolshevism ; and th a t hun­
dred and fifty million R ussians h ate them w orse th a n we
do; th a t there is no Socialism in E ngland, only trade-
unionism , a system of robbing P e te r to pay Paul, w h at
we would have here if our unions seized power.
O ur unions are no longer “free associations,” but
rigid cartels, in w hich the m em bership has no power, the
real pow er being exercised by the few.
W e know w h at Com m unism and Socialism are, they
are not new discoveries of m odern m an, they w ere dis­
covered by the bees and an ts before m an cam e into ex­
istence on th is earth ; th e prehistoric, the classic, the
m ediaeval, the barbaric w orld are full of exam ples, tried
and discarded.
C ontem porary history is replete w ith instances of
Com m unism tru e to nam e w hich have never been a m en­
ace to civilization. A m erica abounds in such instances.
K oreshan U nity o f.E stero , n ear F o rt M yers, Florida, is
a flourishing exam ple. I t is only pseudo Com m unism
and pseudo Socialism th a t are m enaces. The political
Com m unism (Bolshevism ) of R ussia, and the political
Socialism (trade-unionism ) of E ngland are m erely cloaks
fo r the dictatorship of the pro letariat, and by th is m ust
-— 30—
not be understood any dem ocratic m ovem ent in w hich the
p ro letariat have any real power, but an oligarchy w hich
uses the p ro letariat as a m ercenary arm y.
There are only six million C om m unists (Bolsheviks)
in the whole of Russia. There are no b e tter people th an
the R ussians, but they are the m ost docile, regim ented
and enslaved people on earth, enslaved by six million Bol­
sheviks.
These co-tourists claim th a t we are being m isinform ­
ed by our press, th a t the tru th is hidden from us. B ut all
these co-tourists have never been to R ussia, have never
lived under S talin’s satrap s, know less th an others about
actual conditions in R ussia. I t is they who are being
m isinform ed by the R ussian press.
We have m ore th an sufficient evidence of the tru th ,
given to us by R ussians who have escaped from the
knouts of Bolshevism . There is no iron curtain for m any
of us. We are constantly p en etratin g the purlieus of
Sovietism ; w hen, how and by w hom it is not m y purpose
to disclose. Stalin would give m uch to know. As to E ng­
land, these co-tourists cannot claim th a t anything is
being hidden from us there, the land th a t now also breeds
the asinine assassins of defenceless Jew s in Palestine. Only
the m asochist m entalities of Socialists (trad e unions),
Com m unists, N azis, F ascists are able to rev ert to savag­
ery in our m odern world.
W hy shouldn’t we deport these co-tourists to R ussia
and England, in exchenge for the anti-B olshevists and
anti-Socialists (trade-unionists) who are anxious to come
to u s? I am afraid R ussia and E ngland would be de­
populated, and the borders of the U nited S tates would
have to be extended to include the whole of N orth and
South A m erica. B ut it would be conclusive evidence to
the co-tourists and to the world.
* * * *
P aul w as not a Bolshevist. Jew s are not B olshevists,
b u t they have no choice in R ussia, and m any Jew s in
foreign lands still have relatives in countries now dom i­
nated by Russia.
A nti-Sem itism in A m erica, and persecution of the
Jew s in P alestine by G reat B ritain, are driving m any
Jew s to seek aid w here they can get it. F o r instance, if
R ussia prom ises aid to the Jew s in Palestine, and A m eri­
ca and B ritain favor the A rabs ag ain st the Jew s, fo r the
sole purpose of obtaining oil from the A rabs, or a ttra c t­
ing the loyalty of M oslems in India to offset the desire
for freedom of the H indus, is it any w onder th a t m any
Jew s from E astern Europe are friendly to Bolshevism in
Palestine ?
You A nglo-Saxons, w eigh very carefully w hether
your policy is not p reparing your own destruction? To
the m inds of rational, h u m anitarian men, unprejudiced by
religion, nationalism , politics, greed, there is and can be
only one solution: O holy trin ity of Jew , C hristian and
Moslem, living in peace, in term arry in g ; freed from a
B ritish or any other m andate— an independent republic
headed by a trium virate consisting of a Jew , a C hristian,
and a M ahom edan, all w ith equal honor and power, for
“all m en are born free and equal.”—A braham Lincoln.
A suitable triu m v irate until an election by th e adult pop­
ulation could be held, would be the Chief Rabbi, the
O rthodox P atriarch, and the Sheik.
D uring m y seven y ears’ sojourn in the H oly Land,
M oslems and Jew s got along very w ell together, and
th ere is nothing today to prevent a rapprochem ent, except
E ngland’s perennial policy of fishing in troubled w aters,
and dog-in-the-m anger tactics. There are in E ngland
am ong certain classes, the counterparts of the degenerate
P russians. I t is this class th a t has sown discord betw een
Jew and Moslem. In South A frica I learned a t first hand
of the suppression of the n a tu ral developm ent of the
B ritish Colonies on th e p a rt of these degenerate E nglish
If it w ere not for these “m onkey-w renches”, A frica could
surpass A m erica in progress and civilization, for it is a
v a ste r and fa r richer continent.
F o rty years ago a fte r m aking m y on-the-spot study
I proposed to E ngland, w hich w as then ruled by m en of
good faith, and to a Zionist Congress, th a t a Jew ish col­
ony be established in U ganda, and th a t P alestine become
a pro tecto rate of the B ritish Em pire. F o rty years ago
th a t would have been a possible solution. Today it is
im possible, fo r Jew s, C hristians, and M oham edans alike
have no faith in the present Socialist (trad e union) gov­
ernm ent of England.

To rev ert to our story. W e have not been able to
bring all the actors involved on to our sm all stage. O ther
ch aracters w ere operating behind the scenes, guiding the
w orld to its destruction. Some of the ch aracters of this
book believed th a t they w ere ruling the destinies of the
w orld, b u t others quite unknow n to us as yet, whose ac­
tivities barely interlocked w ith those fam iliar to us, w ere
th e actu al arb iters of fate. T heir story, often independ­
ent of th is b u t its consequence, is therefore told else­
w here.
L et us m ourn here for Paul, not for his sake alone but
for the sake of A m erica, for the sake of th e world. He
w as the only m an who could have saved A m erica, but
he w as a Jew.
He w as religious, he practised an all-em bracing re ­
ligion.
H e had the knowledge and experience and b ack­
ground to guide the people out of chaos.
H e loved th e people, he loved A m erica, he loved the
world.
B ut w hen his nam e w as m entionel fo r the presidency,
the answ er w as cu rt and brief. H e is not a R epublican,
he is not a D em ocrat, he is a Jew .
He w as honest, truthful, self-sacrificing.
He w as brave, but he hated war.
A nd w hen he th ru st his defenceless body betw een the
insane com batants, crying Peace! Peace! the bullet of a
Bolshevik destroyed the hope of the world.
* * * *
And Jesus w ent out, and departed from the tem ple;
and his disciples came to him for to show him the build­
ings of the tem ple.
A nd Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these
th in g s? V erily I say unto you, There shall not be left
here one stone upon another, th a t shall not be throw n
down.
And as he sa t upon the m ount of Olives, the disciples
cam e unto him privately, saying, Tell us, w hen shall
these things be ? and w h at shall be the sign of thy
coming, and of the end of the w orld ?
And Jesus answ ered and said unto them , T ake heed
th a t no m an deceive you.
F o r m any shall come in m y nam e, saying, I am
C hrist: and shall deceive m any.
A nd ye shall hear of w ars, and rum ours of w ars;
see th a t ye be not troubled; for all these things m ust
come to> pass, b u t the end is not yet.
F or nation shall rise ag ain st nation, and kingdom
ag ain st kingdom : and there shall be fam ines, and pesti­
lences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
A nd these are the beginning of sorrows.
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and
shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for
m y nam e’s sake.
A nd then shall m any be offended, and shall betray
one another, and shall h ate one another.
A nd m any false prophets shall arise, and shall de­
ceive m any.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of m any
shall w ax cold.
B ut he th a t shall endure to the end, the sam e shall
be saved.
A nd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in
all the w orld for a w itness unto all nations: and then
shall the end come.
W hen ye, therefore, shall see th e abom ination of deso­
lation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy
place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)
Then let them w hich be in Judaea flee into the
m ountains:
L et him w hich1is on the housetop not come down to
tak e anything out of his house:
N either let him w hich is in th e field re tu rn back to
tak e his clothes.
A nd woe unto them th a t are w ith child, and to them
th a t give suck in those days!
B ut pray ye th a t your flig h t be not in the w inter,
neither on the sabbath day:
F o r then shall be g reat tribulation, such as w as not
since the beginning of the w orld to this tim e, nor ever
shall be.
And except those days should be shortened, there
shall no flesh be saved: b u t fo r the elect’s sake those days
shall be shortened.
Then if any m an shall say unto you, Lo, here is
C hrist, or there; believe it not.
F or there shall arise false C hrists, and false
prophets, and shall shew g re a t signs and w onders; inso­
m uch th at, if it w ere possible, they shall deceive the very
elect.
Behold, I have told you before.
W herefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is
in th e desert; go not fo rth : Behold, he is in the secret
cham bers; believe it not.
F o r as the lightning com eth out of the east, and
shineth even unto the w est; so shall also the com ing of
th e Son of m an be.
F o r w heresoever the carcase is, there will be eagles
gathered together.
Im m ediately a fte r the tribulation of those days shall
the sun be darkened, and th e moon shall not give her
light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
pow ers of th e heavens shall be shaken.
And th en shall ap p ear the sign of the Son of man,
in heaven; and then shall all th e tribes of the earth
m ourn, and they shall see the Son of m an com ing in the
clouds of heaven, w ith pow er and g re a t glory.
And he shall send his angels w ith a g reat sound of a
tru m p et; and they shall g ath er to g eth er his elect from
the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Now learn a parable of th e fig tree: W hen his branch
is yet tender, and p u tte th fo rth leaves, ye know th a t
sum m er is nigh:
So likew ise ye, w hen ye shall see all these things,
know th a t it is near, even a t the doors.
V erily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass,
till all these things be fulfilled.
H eaven and earth shall pass aw ay, but m y w ords
shall not pass away.
B ut of th a t day and hour know eth no m an, no, not
the angels of heaven, b u t m y F a th e r only.
B ut as the days of Noe w ere, so shall also the com­
ing of the Son of m an be.
F or as in the days th a t w ere before the flood, they
w ere eating and drinking, m arrying and giving in m ar­
riage, until the day th a t Noe entered into the ark,
A nd knew not, until the flood came, and took them
all aw ay: so shall also the com ing of the Son of m an be.
Then shall tw o be in the field; the one shall be taken,
and the other left.
Two w om en shall be grinding a t the mill; th e one
shall be taken, and the other left.
W atch therefore; for ye know not w hat hour our
Lord doth come.
B ut know this, th a t if the good m an of the house
had know n in w h at w atch the thief would come, he would
have w atched, and would n o t have suffered his house to
be broken up.
T herefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as
ye think not, the Son of m an cometh.
* * * *
Yes, this is how it will be. The brothels, hotels, re­
sorts, parks, lanes, alleys and cars w ill be panting w ith
copulating couples. Saloons, beer-halls, bars, cocktail
lounges will be reeking w ith delirious drunkards. The
dance-halls will be w hirling to the cacophony of jungle
jazz. The degenerate children of degenerate p aren ts will
be devising, undeterred and undetected, new deviltries of
delinquency. The parliam ents and congresses will be fill­

vaporings. All the dam ned doings of the nation th a t P aul

ACT 1. Scene 1.
R eception Room in th e House of Lupus, in a City
adjoining Coal Mines, in Colorado. A n Evening P arty .
Mr., M rs., M iss Lupus, Mr. and M rs. Fidus, Guests.
Fidus: A ngelica has prom ised to recite one of her
poems. She is becom ing quite a poetess, I understand,
and I’m proud of her. Come now, A ngelica! Don’t be
b ash fu l!
A ngelica: T H E STRIK E
Deep in the mines, dense gloom profound,
N or picks nor shovels now resound,
B ut a sullen hum, as of sw arm ing bees:
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
W e’ll dam p the boiler, and starv e the stove,
Slack the w hite furnace and lights. By Jove!
O ur m asters w e’ll squeeze and bring to th eir
knees!
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
W e’ll stop transportation, have expropriation,
M ore pay and less w ork, or w e’ll shirk, w e’ll
shirk!
To hell w ith the w orld and its industries!
Strike! Strike, w hile th e innocent freeze!
Fire-dam p, b last and slide, w e have learned to
dei'ide.
Shall we fear an injunction? To hell w ith
com punction!
O ur ty ra n ts are deaf, th ey deny our pleas.
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
Com passion be dam ned, haven’t m iners been
hanged ?
Shall we sell our soul for the p ro fiteer’s coal ?
To us belongs all; we alone, referees.
S trike; Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
L upus: E xcellent! Those are th eir plans, th eir very
w ords. Now you see, m y friends, and you Fidus, even
your own d aughter condem ns those bums.
A ngelica: B ut I ’m not finished yet, Mr. Lupus.
L upus: Go rig h t ahead. You can’t unsay w h at you’ve
said already.
A ngelica:
H igh in th eir m ansions, the lights in full glow,
H ear the strain of the strings, th e w ine’s law less
flow!
B ut how brief th eir defence, how blunt th eir
decrees:
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
M ake the sw ines’ hours long, and th eir pay a
m ere song,
Keep the high prices high, though the m iners
m ay die!
Shall W E bend to these ? W a alone, legatees.
Strike! Strike, w hile th e innocent freeze!
L upus: T h at’s alright! I t doesn’t h u rt a bit. I own
the coal, so I expect I can burn it as I please; and I ’d like
to see th e Fuel A dm inistrator w ho’ll stop me, or prevent
m e charging w h at I like for m y own property! If he
w on’t do as w e w ant, w e’ll fire him ; and if W ashington
w ont pass our anti-strike laws, w e’ll can the governm ent.
And as to the wine, if the Prince of W ales can ship it to
W ashington, I can drink it here. Those who don’t like
it, can stay dry, or try m y grape juice. I’m not tak in g
any bill-of-fare from W illiam Jennings B ryan yet, and
as I notice, m ighty few of you are. H ere’s to your poem,
A ngelica, kid!
Fidus: A re you through?
A ngelica: No, D addy dear! I know you’re disappoint­
ed, so far, but now you’re com ing into your own.
Then a voice in the w ilderness cries in its pain:
T urn back! T urn back! All th y grasping is vain!
LOOKING BACKW ARDS alone, can heal thy
disease.
S trike not, while the innocent freeze!
H igher pay, higher cost; w hat is w on is thus lost.
If thou g ain st from th y raise, b u t th e innocent
pays.
Sell, share w ith the poor, or m eet heaven’s
closed door.
Till all m eed is equal, th ere’ll be b u t one sequel:
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
Fidus: T h at’s fine, baby! I knew there w as som e­
th in g w rong som ewhere. L et your old daddy kiss you!
T h at’s stra ig h t goods, friends. T h at’s tru th , honest tru th !
The sooner we A m erican m illionaires become C hristians,
the sooner will the A m erican people re tu rn to industry
and contentm ent.
L upus: N ot by a long chalk! I reckon I’m a C hris­
tian, and I ’ve never y et heard a C hristian m inister preach
about selling all and sharing w ith the poor. No, kid!
L et those who w an t money, sw eat fo r it; and those w ho’ve
got it, hold on to it!
A ngelica: I ’ve got another verse, the la st one.
They jeer:
’Tis a poet dem ented, she’ll ra n t till she’s vented.
W e know w h at w e w ant, and w e’ll have it or
fight!
No such devotees can our all-greed appease.
Strike! Strike, w hile the innocent freeze!
L upus: T h at’s me, though you’ve said it yourself.
I ’m for a fig h t to the finish. So long as Lupus is a
m em ber of the firm of Fidus and Lupus, th ere’s going to
be no sharing of the profits w ith outsiders.
Fidus: H ere’s the overseer, and one of th e m en we
sen t for. Now w e’ll get to the bottom >f the m atter.
(E n ter O verseer and B rady.)
L upus: W hat’s your trouble now ?
O verseer: The m en w ant a raise, eight hours a day,
six days a week, all the y ear round.
L upus: Tell ’em to go to hell! Pardon m e ladies!
O verseer: The strik e’ll continue.
L upus: T h at can’t h u rt me. W e’re m ining too m uch
coal anyhow . L et ’em lay off, th a t’ll boost prices.
Fidus: B ut we have a certain am ount of responsi­
bility tow ards the public and especially th e poor, and
w in ter’s upon us.
Lupus: W hat’s the public ever done fo r u s? And
the poor, let ’em go to w ork, cut out these strik e stunts,
and th ere won’t be any poor.
Fidus: I ’d like to g et som ething stra ig h t from the
m en them selves. I ’m a bit suspicious of the unions, and
th a t’s about the only point on w hich I agree w ith you,
Lupus.
L upus: A bunch of crooks, blackm ailers! I could
buy the whole gang, if I w anted to.
Fidus: L et’s h ear the m an. (To B rady.) W e w an t
to be fa ir w ith you boys, so w e’d like to h ear w h at you
have to say. W hat’s all th is talk about a 30% raise, and
the o ther stu ff?
B rady: W e know you’re straig h t, boss, so I’ll tell you
exactly how it stands. We didn’t w ant to strik e a t this
here mine, because you’ve alw ays given us a square deal,
but w e belong to the union, and w h at the union says goes.
Of course w e’re no b e tter off in the long run th an t v'°
m en a t the other mines. Y ou’ve given us good hospitals,
good schools, good clubs, a home fo r the aged and crip­
ples, and God know s th ere’s enough of ’em, b u t we ain’t
got enough w ork nor enough pay. I ’m not blam ing you,
Sir, perhaps it ain ’t your fault. As Mr. Lupus says, if we
dig too m uch coal, the prices’ll drop, and our p ay ’ll drop
as m uch. So w e’ve got to lay off, w ork only half the
year, h alf the week, half the day. B ut w e’ve got to live
all th e year, all the week, all the day, and our w ives and
kids too. How can we live all th e tim e, w hen we g et
pay for only half tim e ? Then you’re paying us regular
union pay, and you give us a bonus th a t th ey don’t g et
a t th e o ther mines, b u t th ere’s no union prices fo r w h at
w e’ve got to buy. You give us a co-operative store and
w e’re b e tte r off th a n lots of others, b u t the H.C.L. has
gone higher, and w hen w e’ve grubbed and clothed the
fam ilv, th ere ain’t nothing left, and no w ork to m ake a
bit. W e’ve got to do it boss. W e’ve got to live. A nd
you know its a risk y job. Look a t the cripples w e’ve got,
the explosions and accidents. B ut w e ain’t afraid of th at,
w e’re used to it. I t ’s a hard job, b u t w e’re w illing to
do it. W e only w an t enough for the wife and kiddies.
Fidus : And I ’ll see you get it. Go back to the mines
and tell ’em so.
B rady: Thank you, boss! (E xit.)
L upus: W hat you’re going to do?
Fidus: I don’t know yet. I’ll th in k it over. W e’ve
recognized the rig h t of collective bargaining, so w e’ll
probably have to do som ething th a t the other operators
agree to. B ut I don’t believe th a t’s going to settle our
labor problem s. N either will your an ti-strik e law s. Thè
m en have as m uch rig h t to w alk out, as we have to lock
them out. So long as w orkers strike, there m ust be a
reason. I t ’s our duty to discover the causes and rem edy
them . R epression will m ean nothing to them b u t oppres­
sion, it will sim ply ag g rav ate the evil, and no doubt drive
every w orking m an in th e country to strike. W e m ay
have to come to profit-sharing—not a m ere bonus added
to a m an’s w ages. T h at is m erely an increase in w ages
and has no direct relationship to a m an’s own w ork. I
believe th a t a m an should have a direct share of the
profits derived from the p articu lar u n it of w ork he him ­
self is doing. W hat th e laboring m an w ants, as I see
it, is, above all else, to be treated as a m an of flesh and
blood.
L upus: So long as L upus is a p a rtn e r in the firm of
Fidus and Lupus th ere’s going to be no sharing of profits
w ith w orking-m en, tak e it from me!
Fidus: I ’ve given you m y opinion and I ’ll give it to
th e commission.
Lupus: (Aside.) The dam n fool! I’ll have to g et rid
of him, the sooner the better.
Fidus: In the m ean tim e I intend to share m y p a rt
of the profits w ith the men.
L upus: You can do as you please w ith w h at’s your
own. Ail I know is, the m ore you give ’em the more
they w ant.
Fidus: They’re like us. W orking m en are as in sati­
able as progress. L et’s go into your study.
(E xeunt Fidus and Lupus. L ights are low ered and a
cu rtain dropped representing a study.)
ACT 2. Scene 2.
Study. Lupus and Fidus.
Fidus: See here, Lupus, I’m going to m ake the g reat
experim ent. I know I’ve no rig h t to draw you in, b u t I
w ant you to do me a favor. O ur annual profits on the
m ines are about four million dollars, m y share is three
million, yours one million. I’ve decided to give the men
tw o million, half the profit, b u t you see it’ll all come out
of m y pocket. I ’ve only got one million th a t I can draw
on, you know the re st is all tied up in new properties or
the old mines. You’ve got about a million in your banks,
I w an t you to lend it me, then I ’ll give the tw o m illion to
Fidus and Lupus, and th ey ’ll divide it am ong all the men
equally. T h at’ll settle the strike for ever.
Lupus: L et’s think it over a m inute. I ju st w an t to
figure out if I ’ve got the million handy. You’re a dam n
fool, anyhow!
(Aside.) H ere’s m y chance, b u t how to use it! I
m ay never have it again. W ith this profit-sharing stunt,
who know s w hat m y q u arter share w ill be w orth in a
couple of m onths. I ’ve got to settle his hash, quick. . . .
I ’ve got it, his signature first, then I ’ll figure how to use
it!
A lright, Fidus, I th in k I can do it for you. I ’ll ju st
g et m y secretary to type a receipt; and as it’s a p retty
little check, we m igh as w ell have a w itness.
(E x it Lupus. He retu rn s in a few seconds w ith his
P riv ate Secretary and P riv ate D etective.)
Ju s t m ake out a receipt for Fidus to me fo r a million
dollars.
P riv ate Secretary: Yes, Sir! (He tak es a double
sheet of foolscap and inserts it in a typew riter.)
L upus: I ’ll ju st m ake out a check. (He sits down
and w rites check.) H ere you are, Fidus. I’m sorry to
see m oney th a t once belonged to m e throw n to the Devil
in this w ay. B ut th a t’s up to you.
Fidus: I ’ll endorse it over to Fidus and Lupus, and
m ake out m y personal check to Fidus and Lupus, then
you can arrange to have the tw o million m ade up into
pay envelops. (He tak es the seat vacated by Lupus,
endorses check and w hile w riting his own, continues:)
I’ll go down to the m ines first th in g in the m orning, and
tell th e boys w h at w e’ve done, and w h at we’re going to
do. I w ant to see the effect.
L upus: I ’ll fix it up. P erhaps I ’ll be able to get down
m yself la te r in th e day, and see the fire-w orks. L et’s
have the receipt. (The S ecretary hands it to him , he
places it before Fidus who signs it and th en rises from
th e seat.)
Fidus: I’ll go and listen to the singing. (E xit.)
L upus: You tw o fellows ju st sign this as w itnesses.
(They both sign.) Now you can join the girls, b u t I
w an t to have a little ta lk to you. (E x it S ecretary.)
H ave you g o t everything fixed?
P riv ate D etective: Yes, Sir!
L upus: Shoot!
P riv ate D etective: I ’ve got five hundred sluggers a t
th e mine. M ost of ’em joined a couple of w eeks ago
and know all th e leaders. I ’ve got th eir nam es and you
can have ’em served w ith the injunction. The gang’s all
ready, ju st w aiting fo r orders to p u t the m achinery out
of com m ission and s ta rt a riot. A bunch of your m iners
didn’t w an t to join the strikers, and w e had some trouble
g ettin g ’em out of the m ines. I t ’ll be a cinch to s ta rt a
fight, and lay out any you don’t w ant.
L upus: I don’t w an t any one th a t’s got a lot of say,
w hether he’s w ith the strik ers or the loyal bunch. Get
the ring-leaders, or ru n ’em out of the nines. L et your
m en sm ash the m achinery tonight. If any of the rin g ­
leaders escape tom orrow , a rre st ’em for sabotage, and
w e’ll g et the balance of th e crew w ith the injunction. I
w an t a clean-up. D’ye g et m e?
P riv ate D etective: Yes, Sir! The chief of the g an g ’s
handy and I’ll give him the word.
L upus: Oh! he is, is h e? Supposing you brin g him
up. I’d like to see w hat kind of a specim en he is. Don’t
let any one see him come up here. U se this door, and
you’d b e tte r stay in the reception room and use your
ears.
P riv ate D etective: Yes, Sir! (E xit.)
L upus: L uck’s w ith me! I ’ll g et the whole dam n
shooting-m atch a t one shot. Clean out the mines, get
possession of ’em, and get rid of Fidus. L et me see.

Now to com plete th is Bill of Sale. T here’s plenty of

Lupus: Only w an t to tak e a peep a t your phiz.
Chief: S ort o’ nickle show, eh?
Lupus: T h at’s about it. Been a long tim e a t the

Chief: W hat gam e have ye particu larly in y er head,

Lupus: Well, boxing bouts w here the o ther fellow ’s

Chief: Guess I’ve practised the noble a rt o’ self de­

L upus: You look like a grow n-up one still.
Chief: T ain’t looks as count, boss.
L upus: No, guess it’s the referee, th a t’s me th is tim e,

it?
Chief: ’Pends on the stakes, boss!
Lupus: I ’ll m ake the purse ten thousand bucks.

Lupus: T h at’s up to you. A re you gam e?
Chief: H e’s not to come back, eh?
Lupus: T h at’s th e talk. A nd you’ve g o t to keep your

Chief: I know th at. W here’s the m atch to be pulled

L upus: H e’ll be down a t the m ines tom orrow m orn­

C hief: S ort o’ orator, eh?
L upus: N ot exactly.
Chief: W h at’s he call him self?
Lupus: Do you agree to the conditions?
Chief: Ten thousand! H ow about the rope or the

L upus: I ’ll keep you out. I t ’ll only be an ex tra ac­

Chief: I tak e ye. W h at’s his nam e?
L upus: Fidus of Fidus and L upus!
Chief: Nix! The m atch’s off! Y e’ll have to double,

Lupus: I t’s a go, b u t no m oney passes till it’s over.
Chief: T h at’s the rule. A ny other propositions, boss?
L upus: N ot tonight. G et out by th is door, and hide

T hey’ll pay m y price or freeze. . . . I ’ll have a strik e
every year, th a t’ll send m y coal up, and o ther industries

coal. The best stock I ’ll keep, until I control W all

stands on a w heel-barrow to address them .
B rady: I w as up to Fidus last night, and he told
me w e’d get w hat w e’re asking for. I know w e’ll get it,
and you know it. W hat’s the use of loafing around w ait­
ing till th e other operators come across ? Fidus gave me
his word, and w e all know w h at th a t m eans. E ven if the
others don’t agree to the m iners’ conditions, w e’ll g et a
square deal a t this pit. W hat ye say, boys, shall we go
down and dig coal?
M iners: I feel like tak in g a chance. So do I. So do
I.
Chief of the G angsters: Y e’re a fine bunch o’ union
men. L ot o’ scabs! Yah! D irty scabs! To dig coal
before the others m ake a deal. Ye ought to be plugged,
the whole dam n lot o’ ye. N o digging for me, till the
others dig. A n’ I don’t believe a dam n w ord o’ this here
Fidus. P erhaps it’s only a stall to get us back on the

B rady: Who the hell are you? You ain’t got no say
here, anyhow. You’ve only been a t th is here p it tw o

all know Fidus. L et’s go down th is m orning!
C hief: I’ll show ye w ho I am, ye d irty scab!
(G eneral fight, shots fired, several fall. In th e dis­

A M iner: There he is! T here’s Fidus, boys! L et him

(Several m iners help Fidus on to the w heel-barrow .)

A ngelica: O God! H e’s shot! Daddy! Daddy! Speak

P.D .: I’ve arrested ’em all. The chief of the gang
w ants to have a private ta lk w ith you, before I let him go.
L upus: T alk w ith m e? W hat’ve I got to do w ith
him ? You’ve paid ’em all, haven’t-y o u ?
P. D.: The chief says he’s got a little private bill to
cash in. W e’ll have to let him slip quick. The m iners
have got it in for him, say he laid out th eir chums, and
B rady says he saw him shoot Fidus. T h at’s a p re tty
serious affair.
L upus: D on’t th in k you’d b e tte r let the chief go. I
didn’t bargain for m urdering Fidus. L et him sw ing for

L u p u s: Are you quite sure ? There w ere lots of guns

B rady: I ’ll sw ear to it.
L u p u s: Then w hy the hell didn’t you stop him ?
B rady: God forgive me, Sir, but I w as sort o’

L upus: W hy didn’t you fellow s knock him on th e

L upus: N onsense; I know B rady. H e’s been w ith
us ten years. He w ouldn’t sm ash a crow -bar. L et him
go, Cap! I ’ll vouch for him.
P. D.: A lright, Sir! (He frees B rady.)
B rady: T hank you, Sir! I w on’t fo rg et it.
Lupus: f w ish you’d got th a t m urderer.
B rady: W e’ll g et him yet, Sir.
L u p u s: Luck to y o u !
(E x it Brady.)
L et ’em g et him !
(E x it P rivate D etective.)
(T hrough the w indw s of the office a group of m iners
is seen welcom ing B rady. B rady addresses them :)
B rady: Boys, let’s rush th e police, and g et th a t
m urderer. I believe he shot our boys also. Come on!
(Followed by a crowd he runs tow ards a group of
prisoners. They seize the Chief of the G angsters and
h an g him to a derrick.)
L upus: D am n good riddance! and tw enty thousand
dollars saved!

ACT 2. Scene 3.
Sam e office as in Scene 2. Lupus and A ngelica in
m ourning.
L upus: W hat do you intend doing ?
A ngelica: I ’m going to stay here, Mr. Lupus. I w ant
to be n ear D addy’s grave.
L upus: W hat good w ill th a t do you?
A ngelica: Mr. Lupus!
Lupus: I m ean w h at’ll you do fo r a living?
A ngelica: I haven’t thought of th a t yet. I expect
D addy left me enough to live on, b u t I don’t w an t to do
th at. I w an t to w ork. I believe everybody should work,
and earn his own bread.
L upus: T h at’s correct. I ’m glad you look a t it th a t
w ay. Fidus didn’t leave you much. I don’t think there’ll
be anything for you, w hen I get things straightened out.
He gave m ost of it aw ay in charity, and had to sell his
in terest in the mines. W hen all the debts are paid, his
in terest m ay be next to nothing.
A ngelica: B ut D addy told me he w as going to share
tw o million dollars of his own m oney w ith the m iners.
Lupus: Did he? I th in k you m ust have m isunder­
stood him. He did speak about a profit-sharing plan,
but it couldn’t have been as m uch as all th at. We did
have som e m oney set aside for som ething like it, but
th a t’ll all be absorbed now in replacing the m achinery
th a t these ragam uffins broke to pieces. If there w as
anything over, I wouldn’t give it ’em anyhow, a fte r w hat
th ey ’ve done. W hat did Fidus g et from ’em for his
ch arity ? A bullet!
A ngelica: Oh! Mr. Lupus, I don’t believe any of our
m en ever thought of such a terrible deed. I t w as th a t
stran g er they hanged. I ’m going to devote m y life to
them . I ’m sure D addy would have w anted m e to. I ’ll
g et a position in the hospital. N ever mind if th ere’s no
m oney for me. I would have given it back to them any­
w ay. I t belonged to them , except D addy’s share for his
services to them . I’m glad he gave them everything.
Lupus: I think you’re foolish, b u t if your m ind’s set
upon it, you m ight as w ell stay here in the office. We
w an t somebody, and I ’d pay you fifteen dollars a week.
A ngelica: Oh! Mr. Lupus, do you really think I’d
be useful here?
Lupus: You m ight be able to do som ething. You
know shorthand and typing.
A ngelica: Oh! T hank you, Mr. Lupus, you’re very
Rind!
Lupus: I ’ve got to do som ething for m y p artn er’s
child.
(He strokes her cheek, but she is unconscious of his
desires. Suddenly she jum ps up.)
A ngelica: I’m going to th an k God on D addy’s grave.
(E xit.)
Lupus: D am n her Daddy!
(C urtain.)
ACT 2. Scene 4.
Sam e office as in previous scene. A ngelica a t type­
w riter and Lupus.
Lupus: H ave you ever thought of m arrying, A ngeli­
ca ?
A ngelica: W hat a strange question, Mr. Lupus?
W hat m akes you ask it ?
L upus: You’ve got such stran g e ideas about different
th in g s /l thought you’d have some about m arriage.
A ngelica: I don’t think I have. B ut I haven’t really
thought m uch about it m yself, although I’ve read quite r
bit. M arriage alw ays brings up to me the picture of
Daddy. He used to speak about m y lost brother, Paul,
and m y dead m other, and said she and I had m ade him
w h at he w as. I t m ust be the m ost w onderful th in g th a t
God gave m an, if it m ade D addv w h at he w as. T h at’s
th e w ay I look a t m arriage—a father, a m other, children,
all helping each o ther to become b e tter people.
L upus: (Aside.) A lw ays h er Daddy!
A ngelica: W hat did you say?
L upus: No! I said . . . Yes! T h at’s a beautiful de­
scription, b u t it doesn’t alw ays happen. Som etim es they
don’t love each other, w h at then?
A ngelica: I th in k people shouldn’t m arry unless they
are sure of each o ther’s love. M arriage is sim ply the
union of tw o people who love each other. If th ere is no
— 36
love, there is no m arriage. I t seem s to me th a t is w h at
God w anted us to do.
L upus: T h at’s right. B u t they m ay love each other
w hen they g et m arried, and cease to love la te r on.
A ngelica: I think if people really love each other,
they can never change. I t m ust be passion th a t they
m istake for love. B ut of course, I really don’t know w h at
passion or love is. I can only im agine.
L upus: (B ending tow ards her.) B u t I know.
A ngelica: (C ontinuing her line of thought w ithout
noticing his ard en t looks.) If such a th in g is really pos­
sible, th a t people m ay cease to love each other, then they
should be divorced.
Lupus: Then you believe in divorce?
A ngelica: W hy shouldn’t I? I ’m not a Catholic, and
I ju s t said, if there is no love, there is no m arriage.
Lupus: B ut I ’m a Catholic.
A ngelica: I don’t understand you, Mr. Lupus.
L upus: I . . . I m ean w h at is a Catholic to do ?
A ngelica: T h at is beyond me. I expect your church
thought as I do w hen it forbad divorce—th a t people
should not m arry unless they love each other, and th a t
tru e love lasts as long as life.
Lupus: B ut w hy shouldn’t a Catholic rebel, though
he is m arried? You said love is before m arriage. (He
tak es her hand.) W hy shouldn’t I . . . (M rs. Lupus
enters abruptly.)
Lupus: (S tartin g up.) W hat the devil are you doing
here ?
M rs. L upus: T hank you! I cam e to see w h at you
are doing here. (She looks a t A ngelica.) You’ve been
com ing down to the m ines ON B U SIN ESS very often
lately. (A ngelica leaves th e room .) I see you have
very im p o rtan t business.
L upus: A t least m y business is no dam n concern of
yours. I ’ve never consulted you, and don’t intend to. I
do w hat suits me. If you don’t like it you have your
rem edy. M ight as w ell save yourself any m ore dirty
spying. N ext tim e you’ll knock before you come into
m y office, or you’ll have the pleasure of being shown
the door by the clerk.
Mrs. L upus: You’re very kind, Mr. Lupus. She m ust
be a w onderful creature to have captivated YOU.
L upus: You can either shut up and get out, or I ’m
going. I ’ve told you if you don’t like it, sue for a di­
vorce.
M rs. L upus: And give you the opportunity of m arry ­
ing th a t thing, a Jew ish hussy.
Lupus: I never w ait fo r opportunities. W hat I w ant
I take.
M rs. L upus: So I see. T h at’s w hy you m arried my
money.
L upus: I t w as the best investm ent your fa th e r ever
m ade.
Mrs. L upus: And I w as your commission.
(E x it Lupus)
The pig! The hussy! I expected it of him , but her,
w ith th a t innocent baby face, and the cloak of religion!
(E n ter A ngelica.)
A ngelica: O Mrs. Lupus, I hope th ere’s nothing
serious the m a tte r?
Mrs. L upus: I w onder w hat your dead fath er would
have said.
A ngelica: A bout w h a t?
M rs. L upus: You and Mr. Lupus.
A ngelica: I don’t understand you, M rs. Lupus. Please
tell me w h at you mean.
M rs. L upus: (Aside.) She plays it off beautifully.
(Aloud.) W hy, all your friends are talk in g about it. I t ’s
disgraceful! A young girl like you, and he a m arried
m an, fath er of a girl as old as yourself!
A ngelica: (She stares a t M rs. Lupus.) Now I th in k I
understand. A nd you believe it? You th in k th a t of m e?
I w on’t even try to deny it, it's too contem ptible, too. . . .
too . . .
(E n ter Lupus.)
L upus: I see you are still here.
(M rs. Lupus looks a t him in fe a r and leaves the of­
fice.)
A ngelica: I ’m going, M r. Lupus. I can’t stay here
any longer. (She tak es h er coat and h at.) T hank you
fo r all you’ve done fo r me.
L upus: I don’t know w h at she said to you, b u t she
doesn’t know w h at she’s talk in g about. She’s crazy.
Jealousy, nothing but jealousy! Don’t tak e any notice of
her.
A ngelica: Good-bye, M r. Lupus.
Lupus: B ut w here w ill you go to, w h at w ill you do?
A ngelica: I don’t know. P erhaps I ’ll go E a st to
D addy’s relatives. P erhaps I ’ll find Paul. I ’ll go to
D addy’s grave to say Good-bye, and I ’m sure he’ll show
m e the w ay.
Lupus: T h at’s foolish! You can’t go like th at. I ’ll
tell you w hat I ’ll do w ith you. I ’ve got a beautiful little
cottage in the S ierra N evada. T here’s nobody there but
an old caretaker. I t ’s fa r aw ay from everybody. Go up
there fo r a couple of m onths, till all th is nonsense is
forgotten. Then you can either come back or go E ast,
ju st as you like. A ny w ay it’ll give you tim e to think
it over.
A ngelica: I don’t th in k I ought to accept your offer.
Lupus: Of course you should. I ’ll send th e clerk over
to help you pack. I ’ll go and g et a ticket.
(E xit Lupus. W hile A ngelica is pondering, the cur­
tain drops.)
ACT 3. Scene 1.
Sunset a t C ottage in S ierra N evada. Pines, orange
grove, w aterfall, valleys, hills, a brook, a beehive.
A ngelica on th e porch.
A ngelica: Isn ’t it w onderful here! I’d like to stay
fo r ever, b u t I m ust go into the w orld to w ork as others.
I ’m no b e tte r th an they. Look a t the w onderful sunset!
Now th e noon,
W earied w ith su ltry toil, declines and falls,
Into th e mellow eve:-—the w est p u ts on
H er gorgeous beauties,—palaces and halls,
And tow ers, all carv’d of the unstable cloud,
W elcome the calm ly w aning m onarch —
he,
Sinks gently m idst th a t glorious canopy
Down on his couch of rest—even like a proud
K ing of the earth — the ocean.
(She tu rn s tow ards the w aterfall, rises from h er
chair. In th e distance Lupus approaches, dressed in m o­
toring clothes. She does not notice him .)
E verything here inspires one w ith poetry. Look a t
th a t w onderful fall, catching the ray s of the settin g sun.
C ertainly B yron stood before such a sight.
(Lupus stops to listen to her.)
The fall of w aters! rapid as the light,
The flashing m ass foam s shaking the abyss;
The hell of w aters! w here they howl and hiss,
And boil in endless to rtu re; w hile the sw eat
Of th eir g re a t agony, w rung out from this
T heir Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of je t
T h at gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,
And m ounts in spray the skies, and thence again
R eturns in an unceasing shower, w hich round,
W ith its unem ptied clouds of gentle rain,
Is an eternal A pril to th e ground,
M aking it all one em erald:—how profound
The gulf! and how th e g ian t elem ent
Prom rock to rock leaps w ith delirius bound,
C rushing the cliffs, w hich, dow nw ard w orn and
ren t
W ith his fierce footsteps, yield in chasm s a fe a r­
ful vent
To the broad colum n w hich rolls on.
Lupus: W onderful!
(She tu rn s in surprise.)
A ngelica: I did not know anyone w as listening
to me. W hen did you come ?
Lupus: I w as inspecting some new properties in the
neighborhood, and thought I’d come and sleep here to ­
night. I t ’s a w onderful place, b u t I m ust confess I never
saw its beauty, till I heard you describe the falls ju st now.
A ngelica: Isn ’t it lovely! B ut I m ust go and p re­
pare a room for you, and perhaps you’re hungry?
Lupus: No, don’t trouble. I told the caretak er to get
the room fixed up, and I’ve had m y dinner. S it down
and tell me how you’re g ettin g on.
A ngelica: I’ve been going back to m y poetry since
I ’ve been here. You can’t help it. I’m sure I ’ll be a
poetess a fter I’m dead.
L upus: W hy w ait till you’re dead?
A ngelica: I m ust go back to the h au n ts of m en to
earn my bread by the sw eat of m y brow.
L upus: You needn’t. This place is yours if you w ish.
A ngelica. . . .
A ngelica: No, I can’t accept it. I t ’s very kind of you,
b u t I can’t live on charity.
Lupus: I t ’s not charity, A ngelica. I t ’s . . . , it’s . . . ,
don’t you understand, A ngelica?
A ngelica: I know you feel as if you had some re ­
sponsibility tow ards me, and I appreciate it, b u t I be­
lieve it’s everyone’s duty to share in the toil of the world,
and I m ust do m y share. I believe th a t’s w h at God p u t
us here for. T here’s your chauffeur. I’ll g et him som e
supper. (She disappears in the cottage.)
L upus: She m akes m e mad. If she can’t under­
stand, I ’ll force her. It can’t be th a t she doesn’t know.
E very w om an does. . . P erhaps it’s th a t th a t determ ines
me to have her. Yes, I ’ll have her, tom orrow , and I’ll
m ake h er understand. . . I t ’s im possible th a t she’ll re ­
pulse me. H aven’t I offered h er this place, and all thg
m oney she w ants. . . . If she doesn’t understand, so m uch
th e b etter. Tom orrow!
(C urtain.)
ACT 3. Scene 2.
The porch a t dawn. Lupus, A ngelica, C aretaker,
C hauffeur.
L upus: I w an t you to go into tow n w ith this letter.
C hauffeur: Yes Sir!
L upus: (To C aretaker.) A nd you can go w ith him.
You haven’t had a vacation fo r some tim e, so you needn’t
g et back till bed-tim e.
C aretaker: T hank you, Sir, you’re very considerate.
L upus: (To A ngelica.) Do you w an t anything in the
town.
A ngelica: I can’t ju st th in k of anything. No, never
m ind th is tim e.
(E x it C hauffeur and C aretaker. The noise of the
autom obile is heard. She looks around w hile he looks a t
her.)
E very day I discover new wonders.
DAW N
How beautiful doth all natu re daw n before me!
V alleys and" hills and bubbling brooks,
The shim m ering sky, arm ed as w ith darts,
From Phoebus’ bow to H esperus shot,
A s if to hurl the pale D iana into gloom.
H ark; the glorious chorus of the birds,
V ying in love and praise to m ate and God!
The daw n is theirs, even to drow n the falls,
And hush the breeze,
T h at steals through th eir coniferous bowers.
I t w afts to m e a quickening fragrance,
Laden w ith rose and orange grove and sw eet
verbena,
T h at draw from yonder drow sy hive
E m ancipated bees to dewy baths.
M ay they serve as inspiration to m y sex!
To give the n ectar of our lips to those who love
A nd h arb o r us w ith care and w isdom ;
B ut to the drones th a t sip in ease and lust
Come death, inflicted by our stings!
L u p u s: I don’t know m uch about poetry, b u t it sounds
good. B ut haven’t you fo rgotten som ething about the
bees ? I read som ething la st n ight in one of your books,
I th in k it w as K eats:
E ven bees, the little alm s-m en of spring bowers,
K now th ere is richest juice in poison-flowers.
As you Wish to follow the bees, let me be your poison-
flower, A ngelica.
A ngelica: T h at is the first tim e you have ever quoted
poetry, so I ’ll cap it. B ut let a w om an answ er you, for
som ehow I seem to feel like a w om an th is m orning.
I know the very difference th a t lies
’Tw ixt hallow ’d love and base unholy lust;
I know the one is as a golden spur,
U rging the sp irit to all noble aim s;
The other but a foul and m iry pit,
O’erthrow ing it in m idst of its career.
— 37 —
Lupus: Call it lust, if you will. Call it w hatever you
like, I don’t care any more. I w ant you, and I ’ll have you.
(He seizes her arm .)
A ngelica: Mr. Lupus, w hat’s th e m a tte r w ith you?
L upus: I don’t w an t to h u rt you so don’t force me to.
(He tries to drag her into the cottage. She resists.
H e lifts her up and carries her into the cottage. The
audience is left in suspense for several m inutes, then
Lupus em erges dishevelled and flushed.)
I should have used the chloroform or the drug. She’s
like a m ad bitch, w orse th an a sw arm of bees. I w as a
fool. . . . W ell haven’t I given h er th is cottage, and all
the m oney she w ants, the ung ratefu l idiot! W ithout me
she would have starved, had to go to w ork to earn a few
dollars. I’ll tell her she’ll have to g et out of this. T h a t’ll
bring h er to h er senses. (A ngelica em erges, haggard,
dishevelled, w ith a cloak throw n across h er arm .)
A ngelica: You cow ardly w retch, you infernal scound­
rel, so th a t’s w h at you brought m e here for, th a t is w hy
you sent the servants aw ay! T h at is w h at you call love!
(She flings some coins and bills in his face.) T here’s the
last of your money! If th ere is any justice in the land,
you’ll pay fo r this w ith your life. There m ust be m en
in A m erica who will avenge me!
(She sta rts off.)
L upus: I m ust stop her. She’ll ruin me.
(He hurriedly tak es a bottle out of his pocket, pours
som e chloroform on a handkerchief, rushes a fte r her,
seizes her from behind, and th ru sts the handkerchief into
h er face. She becom es limp in his arm s, he carries her
back to th e porch and places her in a chair.)
D am n her! How th e devil could I tak e such a risk
fo r a baggage like th at. . . . B ut w h at’ll I do w hen she
w akes up ? and the servants get back ? Then th ere m ay
be some visitors before I can .fix things up. . . . I t ’d be
b etter if she didn’t w ake up a t all. . . . I t ’s risky, but
I’ve got to tak e the chance. I ’ll tell the chauffeur and
the caretak er she took an overdose of a sleeping-draught,
and th a t th ey ’d b etter keep th eir m ouths shut, as I don’t
w ant any new spaper talk. T hey’ll do it. They can’t
afford to do anything b u t w hat I tell ’em.
(He looks around to see th a t no one is in sight, takes
the bottle from his pocket, and pours the contents be­
tw een her lips.)
(C urtain.)
ACT 4. Scene 1.
Palace of Lupus (now know n as M orning) in Rome.
M orning, M rs. M orning, Miss M orning (Lucille), Count
von Schw ernot, Prince of the Alps, N obility, U niform ed
D iplom ats and O fficers, O pera Singers, P riv ate Secretary,
P riv ate D etective. A P rim a D onna sings a selection.
Count von Schw ernot: (To M orning w here no others
can hear.) M r. M orning, I believe your country is very
favorably disposed tow ards Russia. Isn ’t th a t so?
M orning: E xactly, your H ighness!
C ount: Can you im agine any eventuality th a t woul'!
cause a reversal of th is traditio n al a ttitu d e ?
M orning: M any, your Highness.
C ount: F or instan ce?
M orning: Business!
C ount: Ah, yes! I understand th a t Miss M orning has
a very high opinion of our G erm an nobles, and th a t m any
of ihy countrym en have laid th eir titles a t h er feet.
M orning: M ostly em pty ones, your H ighness, and m y
daughter is w orthy of a reigning prince.
Count: T h at is difficult w ithout an Em peror.
M orning: I t has been granted in the case of young
ladies w hose fath ers have been raised to the nobility.
C ount: A h yes! I see. B ut the groom s w ere not
quite reigning princes.
M orning: My d aughter is am bitious, your Highness.
C ount: No doubt! And A m erican heiresses are
usually w orthy of th eir am bitions.
M orning: You fla tte r m y countryw om en, your H igh­
ness.
C ount: N ot a t all. I consider A m erican m en the
equals of A m erican women. You, for instance, I believe
control the whole A m erican financial world. I under­
stand your com m ands on W all S treet are as faithfully
obeyed as the behests of our form er E m peror in G erm any.
M orning: You exaggerate, your H ighness.
C ount: I daresay in case of w ar you could determ ine
the direction to be tak en by all A m erica’s resources.
M orning: T h at would depend, your H ighness.
C ount: Do you th in k A m erican public opinion could
be turned even ag ain st R ussia, so th a t in case of w ar
your country would not only not rem ain n eu tral but
w ould give financial and m aterial aid to R ussia’s ene­
m ies?
M orning: If it would pay us better, your H ighness.
C ount: M ost interesting, Mr. M orning. You A m eri­
cans are the m ost p ractical people in the world. I shall
esteem it an honor to serve you and the charm ing Miss
M orning w hen I retu rn to Berlin. (The C ount w ith ­
draw s to an other p a rt of th e room.)
M orning: (To him self.) I w onder w h at’s his gam e.
Looks like G erm any’s going to plug R ussia. T h at m eans
Italy, A ustria, France, England, perhaps the w hole dog­
gone earth. Well, I should w orry! B ut I ’ll g et busy.
P erhaps I can do m ore on W all S treet th a n his H ighness
im agines. Guess he w as kidding m e about A m ericans.
T rying to g et m y goat, and draw me. D idn’t spill much,
I reckon. If m y kid’s not good enough for a sau erk rau t
prince, a D ago one’ll have to do, and I ’ll buy the title
baron from Ita ly cheaper th an I ’d g et it from G erm any.
P erhaps it’d be b etter business too in the long run. Who
know s w here G erm any’ll be in a general shake-up. E n g ­
land’s got it in for G erm any, and it’d cost som ething to
run the blockade of John B ull’s fleet, if John Bull takes
a hand ag ain st G erm any. I calculate I’ll have a little
business talk w ith Italy ; see if I can’t queer the Alliance.
(He approaches an Italian noblem an and draw s him
aside.)
Y our Italian m usic deserves its position of p re­
eminence, Prince. I t certainly is unapproachable. In fact,
you Italian s are a m ore gifted people th a n the re st of the
w orld gives you credit for. My a rt collector here tells me
you are not an unw orthy progeny of A ncient Rome. The
old m arbles are not g re a te r th an the canvasses of
R aphael, M ichelangelo, T itian, T in to retto and Leonardo
da Vinci. D ante is probably g reater th an the "Ancients.
M arconi ran k s w ith our Edison. I am proud to live in
Rome, and will esteem it a privilege to be allied w ith a
m odern Rom an.
Prince of the A lps: Such praise com ing from the
Croesus of the New W orld deserves to be acknow ledged
by the whole of Italy. Speaking for m yself, Mr. M orning,
I can assure you th a t an alliance w ith th e A m erican who
appreciates Italian art, science and literatu re so eloquent­
ly would be deemed the highest honor by any Rom an. B ut
I have not heard of the alliance a t w hich you hint.
M orning: I t ’s nothing, P rince; m erely an expression
of m y sentim ents.
P rince: W ith such encouragem ent the fa ir Miss
M orning will soon be besieged by a m yriad of suitors.
M orning: Keep it to yourself.
P rince: Y our confidences are highly flatterin g , Mr.
M orning.
M orning: No fla tte ry a t all. I ’m sure th e tru s t re­
posed in you by Italy has never been betrayed, and th a t
your affection fo r your country will constrain you to use
w ith due caution w hatever I m ay say to you.
P rince: You are enigm atic, Mr. M orning, b u t you
have m y w ord of honor th a t our conversation will go no
farther.
M orning: T h at’s not w h at I m ean, Prince. I w an t it
to go to the Prem ier.
P rin ce: I m ust be unusually dense tonight, or I would
understand the in terest of m y country in the alliance you
m entioned.
M orning: L et me speak clearly. I do not refer to
m y d aughter now. T h at w as m erely a little secret be­
tw een ourselves. I have reason to fear th a t a grave
calam ity th reaten s Italy.
P rince: You astonish me. Please speak freely.
M orning: L et us tak e a suppositional case, for in­
stance, w ar betw een G erm any and R ussia. Italy would
join G erm any.
P rince: C ertainly, we have a treaty .
M orning: T hat would m ean the slavery of Italy, per­
haps its disappearance from the m ap of Europe.
P rince: You astound me! If you w ere not Mr. M orn­
ing, I w ould barely tak e your w ords a t th e value I m ust.
P ra y continue.

M orning: You know our trad itio n al friendship for
Russia. E ngland and F rance are allies of R ussia. Speak­
ing for A m erican business in terests I can assure you th a t
A m erica will be ag ain st you. If G erm any w ins you will
never recover Ita lia Irredenta, you will never set foot in
A sia Minor. If G erm any is defeated, and Italy is on the
side of G erm any, Italy w ill shrink alm ost to nothing. If
however, G erm any is defeated, and Ita ly is w ith us, then
there is Italia Irredenta, Trieste, Fium e, A sia, A frica, and
freedom from P russian dictatorship.
Prince: I do not know w h at to think, Mr. Morninr-
your w ords are so overpow ering. B ut w hy do you speak
of w ar betw een G erm any and R ussia?
M orning: I do not say there will be w ar, but if it
comes to th at, I hope you will let your governm ent know
w h at I have said.
Prince: They shall know it im m ediately. And now
I will go pay m y respects to Miss M orning.
M orning: R em em ber our little secret, Prince.

ACT 4. Scene 2.
Palace of M orning in Rome. M orning and Prince of
the Alps in uniform .
Prince: I recall the evening w hen you prom ised me
the unattainable.
M orning: H aven’t I fulfilled m y prom ise? The w ar
has m ade me the richest m an in the world. You and m y
daughter will in herit it all.
Prince: I speak for m y country. A t th is very m o­
m ent, the A ustrians m ay have launched th eir m arch on
Rome. In stead of Italia Irred en ta, T rieste, A frica, Asia,
we are to be divided betw een G erm any and A ustria. Be­
fore th a t I will die. My m en are w aiting for me to lead
them to death. I have come to say Adieu!
M orning: B ut surely you will m arry Lucille before
you leave Rom e again ?
Prince: I will not m ake her m y wife today, and leave
her m y widow tom orrow .
M orning: You can resign from the arm y, and re tu rn
w ith us to A m erica. Rom e is not the safest place in the
w orld ju st now.
Prince: You once said we w ere a w orthy progeny of
A ncient Rome. W hy th in k th a t I have since turned
tra ito r and poltroon? A m ericans m ay ignore the das­
tard ly m urder of women and children on the Lousitania,
we Italians are different. Adieu!
M orning: W ait! All is not lost yet. Prom ise me not
to g et shot, and Ita ly will win.
Prince: My dear M orning, you am use me! Of w hat
value are your prom ises?
M orning: A m erica shall en ter the w ar! Ten million
Y anks will be here in a few m onths! I ’ll flood Italy w ith
A m erican coal, steel, food, am m unition!
Prince: You seem to forget th a t W ilson w as elected
P resident because he kep t you out of w ar.
M orning: W ilson be dam ned! I’m boss in the U.S.
Prince: Then w hy have your prom ises to us failed?
M orning: B ecause I’m in this gam e for profit. The
longer it lasts, th e m ore th ere’s in it for me. I’ve m ade
E ngland p a rt w ith her securities. I ’ve bought English
bonds and m y own back a t a discount. I’ve floated loans
fo r E ngland in A m erica. The Old W orld owes me m ore
th an it can ever pay. I’ve tran sferred th e B ank of
E ngland to m yself. It couldn’t be done, unless John Bull
w as alm ost bled to death.
Prince: A nd you would have left us to our fa te?
M orning: Y ou’d be alrig h t in A m erica.
Prince: U ntil the G erm an navy reached New York.
A fter Italy, A m erica!
M orning: L et’s drop th a t. I ’ll show you w h at I can
do. (He rings a bell and his P riv ate S ecretary enters.)
Code this to m y lobbyist in W ashington:
G erm an tre a ty w ith Mexico. P rep arin g to invade
A m erica. R oosevelt m ade peace betw een R ussia
and Japan. We can dictate E uropean peace,
but only on condition th a t A m erica enters w ar
im m ediately. Also necessary, if G erm an invasion
to be forestalled. O pportunity for g reater nam e

drop every cent Europe owes us, if we don’t save
our debtors.
(To Prince.) Now, w ill you prom ise?
P rince: If it m eans the salvation of Italy, I m ust
prom ise, but I will retu rn to m y troops.
M orning: I t ’s a bargain.

ACT 4. Scene 3.
Palace of M orning in Rome. R eception in honor of
m arriag e of Lucille M orning to Prince of th e Alps.
P rince: Allow me to g reet you, B aron M orning!
M orning: B aron!
P rince: F o r your services to Italy, the governm ent
has been pleased to confer this title upon you.
M orning: Prince, this is th e happiest day of m y life.
I did w h at I could and never expected to be paid fo r it.
Please convey m y eternal gratitu d e and subm ission to
the Prem ier.
P rince: I also w ish to th an k you, B aron, for th a t
m agnificent gift. (Points to an oil painting.) I t is a
m asterpiece and is another proof of your excellent ju d g ­
m ent and unexam pled patronage of art.
(M orning and th e Prince w ithdraw to one side out of
hearing of the other guests.)
I really cannot understand your love for every­
thing artistic. Y our collections are the m arvel of the
world. I hope th ey afford you the pleasure they w ere
intended to inspire.
M orning: Pleasure! Yes pleasure through profit.
This studio jargon and my collections bring me in contact
w ith th e fashionable w orld, diplom ats, people who have
m oney to invest. I depend on m y a rt collectors to m ake
the rig h t selections. Besides, it’s a good investm ent. A rt
treasu res increase in value as quick and safer th an stocks
and bonds.
P rince: Ah! I understand.
M orning: Then m y collectors in all p a rts of the
w orld keep me posted on the genius of the people.
P rince: How are you interested in th a t?
M orning: By genius I m ean the policy of a nation.
F o r instance, the genius of E ngland is or w as expressed
in F ree Trade, the Survival of the F ittest, form ulated by
D arw in. I counted on th a t to destroy Self-D eterm ination,
the UN.
P rince: Ah! You proposed it because you knew you
could destroy it?
M orning: Yes! W ith Self-D eterm ination w hat would
Italy have in A sia or A frica? E ngland would lose her
possessions. She is now in the position of a gam bler who
has lost practically all, and can recoup only by con­
tinuing the gam e. A UN would stop the gam e of the Sur­
vival of the F itte s t to prom ote w hich E ngland has F ree
Trade. So long as the gam e continues there is a chance
for h er to get back w h at she has lost. If E ngland had
not lost so much, she undoubtedly would be the strongest
advocate of the U N. She has alw ays stood in the van­
guard of sim ilar m ovem ents, b u t until she gets back w h at
she has lost during the w ar, I can stifle the UN. I don’t
w an t it. I t ’s bad fo r business. I m ake m oney w hen
th ere’s trouble, not w hen people or nations can settle
th eir disputes am icably. I stir up the stock-exchange,
and buy w hen others are compelled to sell. W ithout this
w ar, E nglish financiers would not have lost to me. W ith­
out th is w ar, Ita ly would not have gained w h at she has,
and w ith Self-D eterm ination and a UN she could not keep
w hat she has gained.
P rince: It does not seem honorable. I suppose there
is a flaw som ew here in your philosophy, though I can­
not nam e it. It, however, w orks out ju stly in th e case of
Italy, so I m ust subm it.
By th e w ay, you spoke of retu rn in g to A m erica.
M orning: Only poor A m ericans live in A m erica, and
they go South in W inter, N orth in Sum m er, W est in
Spring, and E a st in th e Fall.
(A side) I can’t tell him th e jig ’s up, th a t G erm any
will soon m arch in, and th a t will be the end of Italy.
P rince: Ah! N ow I understand w hy A m ericans eat
ice cream a t C hristm as. (A young lady comes hurriedly
tow ards them .)
— 39
Y oung Lady: Oh! B aron! The A m erican m edium has
ju s t w ritten a poem w ith the planchette, and we w ant you
to hear it. (She drags him tow ards the o ther guests.)
G uests: R ead it! R ead it!
M edium:
PROM ANG ELICA
M orning: Stop!
M edium: Yes, Baron!
M orning: L et me see it! (H e tak es the paper and
reads it hurriedly, w hile attem p tin g to hide his anxiety.
M rs. M orning comes nex t to him .)
G uests: R ead it aloud, B aron! R ead it aloud!
(M orning hands the paper back to th e M edium.)
M edium:
I have crossed the n atal bourne,
I have won the sp irit plane,
W here the w aiting cease to m ourn
And im m ortals know no bane.
My transition w as a dream
Out of w hich I w oke to life,
To a w orld of love and paean,
W here all h e a rt ties still are rife.
F o r the sire who sought me long
Held m e clasped w ithin his arm s,
And I heard the welcome song,
T h at enthralled me as w ith charm s.
Thus I w andered in his care
Through the friendships of the soul,
M idst the fields and flow ers rare,
And the pleasures w ithout toll.
And the earth and all bereft
W as effaced as by a m ist,
Y et the w aves of those I left
All the dikes of heaven kissed.
Till they grew unto a roar,
Told me of the voices’ dearth,
Bade me en ter en rapport;
And m y m essage sailed to earth:
T here’s no death! W e all do live!
You m ay h ear the voices still,
See the au ras th a t we give,
If you w ish it, if you will!
G uests: How beautiful! Isn ’t it w onderful?
M orning: (Aside.) I w as alm ost afraid she w as go­
ing to say som ething. W hat rot! I t isn’t her. T here’s
no such thing. Bunk! B ut it’s stran g e he got her nam e
and about her sire.
G uests: W ho’s A ngelica? Do you know her, B aron?
Please tell us all about her!
M orning: No! No! I never heard of such a person.
I t’s nonsense!
G uests: And you, B aroness?
M rs. M orning: Gee! I t alm ost scared me to death.
I thought it w as som ebody I used to know, b u t it w asn’t.
I never heard of such a person. L et us dance.
( A dance and curtain.)
ACT 5. Scene 1.
The stage is divided into tw o p arts, fro n t and back.
The back represents a bedroom in w hich the death-bed
scene tak es place. The fro n t half is in obscurity during
Scene 1.
Bed-room . M orning sick in bed. A N urse busy. A
D octor exam ining M orning. S itting around, M rs. M orn­
ing, a P riest, a Professor, a Law yer.
M orning: W ell^D octor, I expect I’m going?
D octor: W hile th ere’s life th ere’s hope.
M orning: I’m not afraid to go. I ’ve never been afraid
of anything. T h at’s w hy I could do w hat I did. T h at’s
w hy I ’ve got w hat I have. I didn’t even fear the Devil.
How about that, F a th e r Ig n atiu s?
F a th e r Ignatius: N o good m an need fear Satan.
M orning: I built a church ju st to nag him. P erhaps
I ought to build another, ju st for spite, to keep him aw ay
from m y death-bed!
F a th e r Ignatius: H e dare not approach you. If all
th e sons of the C hurch w ere as faith fu l as you, m y son,
H ell would soon be em pty.
M orning: H ere, Bruno, give F a th e r Ignatius h alf a
million, no m ake it a million, for a new church. Call it
a fee for absolution.
B runo: Yes, Baron! (Bruno m akes a note.)
F a th e r Ig natius: My son, I absolve thee. The Holy
F a th e r w ill rem em ber you for this in his prayers. The
blessings of the whole C atholic Church w ill follow you.
May the intercession of the Saints assuage your suffer
ing!
M orning: T ut! T ut! I ’m alright. I t ’s ju st to spite
the Devil. . . . and those accursed m iners. Build it am ong
’em. T hey’re all atheists. If th ey ’d only go to church,
they w ouldn’t go on strike. W hen I’m gone th ey ’ll w an t
to forget me. The church will m ake them rem em b
M orning and his iron fist. D ra t ’em! . . . Well, Professor,
w h at can I do for you, before I go?
Professor: B aron, I am not here to receive, b u t to
give w hatever lies in m y power. I have been delegated
to express the sorrow of th e whole student-body, alum ni,
and faculty of th e noble foundation th a t bears your nam e.
M orning: I expect th a t’s about all you can do for
me. I a t least did som ething w ith m y money, but w hat
can you do for me w ith your science? You’ve been
experim enting w ith the living and w ith the dead. You
haven’t found the origin of being, the elixir of life, or
th e cause of death. I experim ented w ith gold, and
learned all th ere is to know about it.
P rofessor: I t takes tim e and money.
M orning: T h at’s it—tim e and money! Well, I m ight
as well give you a few million more. I can’t tak e it
w ith me. B u t I don’t see w h at good it’s going to do me
now. W hile I w as alive, it w as a sop to public opinion.
You have to give charity and build universities and endow
libraries, ju st as you have to pay taxes. B ut I ’d rath er
give it aw ay and g et som e honor and advertising, than
let the people tak e it aw ay from me in the form of ta x ­
ation. . . W ell, I suppose you and the Church did all you
could for me, you helped me sell stock, you defended my
renutation and m y financial operations, and I’d rath er
give it you, th an share w ith the dam ned proletariat.
They never did anything for me. My own w orkingm en
did nothing b u t strike, and try to rob me of the profits
w hich I earned through m y own intelligence w ithout the
help of th eir brute bodies. If it hadn’t been for me,
th ey ’d have starved, the ingrates!
P rofessor: E ducation will teach th e w orking classes
to appreciate ju stly the services rendered hum anity by
g re a t captains of industry such as you, Baron.
M orning: I don’t know so m uch about th at. The
m ore they know, the m ore they w ant.
Professor: T h at’s because w rong system s of educa­
tion. . . .
M orning: A lright, Professor. Give ’em the rig h t kind
and w e’ll m ake it five millions. Bruno, arrange th at.
Professor: B aron. . . .
M orning: I m ight as w ell get som ething fo r m y
money. Professor, I understand you’ve m ade some
sta rtlin g discoveries about the dead and dying.
Mrs. M orning: Oh! don’t let us speak about th a t now!
D octor: I ’m afraid, B aron, you are tirin g yourself
w ith all this conversation. I shall have to order the
visitors out of the room.
M orning: I ’m doing the ordering still. W hen I’m dead
som ebody else’ll do it. W hile I ’m alive I’m going to
know it. I ’ll die talking. . . Now, Professor, sit .down
again. You, F a th e r Ignatius, I ’ll excuse you. W hen I
stop talking, give me the unction. (F ath er Ignatius bows
him self out.) Professor, have you been aisle to com­
m unicate w ith th e departed ?
Professor: We have investigated some inexplicable
cases of psychic phenom ena and received m essages p ur­
porting to come from discarnate beings, but we have not
y et been able to establish th eir com plete authenticity.
M orning: A nd never will. W hen w e’re dead, w e’re
dead!
Professor: N ot alw ays. Baron.
M orning: H ow’s th a t?
P rofessor: We have not yet been able to explain or
recognize all cases of suspended anim ation or trance.
M orning: You m ean to say th a t I m ay be buried
alive ?
— 40 —
D octor: Oh no, Baron! M edical science has provided
ag ain st such an eventuality.
M orning: H ow ?
D octor: I’d ra th e r not explain ju st now.
M orning: I dem and to know. You tell me, Professor!
Professor: W hile tran sferrin g a cem etery some years
ago, it w as discovered th a t a high proportion of the
corpses showed signs of having been buried alive. It
w as then decided to inject a virulent poison into all
corpses to m ake death certain before interm ent.
M orning: D octor, see th a t it’s done. I don’t w ant
to w ake up in m y coffin. . . .
M rs. M orning: Oh, dear, do let us stop this. . .
M orning: A lright. Professor, is it tru e th a t the dy­
ing see th eir p a st rise before them ?
P rofessor: T h at happens very often. Those w ho have
recovered from a trance, also affirm th a t they see their
future.
M rs. M orning: Please, dear!
M orning: A lright! I ’m tired anyw ay. I ’ll re st a lit­
tle and. . . .
(He sinks back on a pillow. The doctor bends over
him. A fter a few m om ents he goes out and retu rn s w ith
F a th e r Ignatius w ho adm inisters extrem e unction. Sud­

ACT 5. Scene 2.
W hile the lights are lowered, scenery from the w ings
shuts off the view of the bed-room, and th e front h alf of
the stage takes on a celestial appearance.
C elestial Judge and Spirit of M orning.
Spirit of M orning: A re you God?
Celestial Judge: I am b u t one of his judges.
Spirit: Is th ere a God?
Judge: I have said, I am b u t one of his judges.
Spirit: Then w hy does he not show him self?
Judge: H ere, or on ea rth ?
Spirit: Both. If I had seen him on earth, I would
have regulated m y life differently. If I see him here, I
will believe you.
Judge: Thou didst not see all the kings of the earth,
though thou w ert honored by m any. Thou didst never­
theless believe th a t others existed. M en who have
seen God have lived on the earth. T hey left their te sti­
monies. If thou hadst not learned to consider all men
liars, thou w ouldst have believed them . . . Only such as
are judged w orthy according to th y earth ly standards
are presented to th y earth ly m onarchs. D ost thou con­
sider theyself fit to stand in the presence of God?
Spirit: W hy have I been brought before you?
Judge: To be judged.
Spirit: I did not know, I did not believe in a fu tu re
life.
Judge: Thou Shalt not be judged according to th a t
belief, but according to thine acts.
Spirit: B ut m y acts w ould have been different, if 1
had know n th a t I w as to be arraigned a fte r death.
Judge: The crim inal constrains his acts through re ­
spect for earth ly law s, not through spontaneous action.
If thou had st foreseen th is day, thou w ouldst have order­
ed th y life in fear of punishm ent, to pro fit here as thou
didst profit on earth. D oth th y conscience tell thee th a t
rew ard is granted fo r deeds done through fear or self-
in terest? The stan d ard of te rre stria l conscience is not
different from th a t of heaven. W hether thou didst or
didst not believe in im m ortality, could not cast th y con­
science in a different mould. D ost thou plead ignorance
of conscience’ law ?
Spirit: B ut God’s law teaches forgiveness. I dem and
th a t m y sins be forgiven. I dare not plead ignorance,
for all m y deeds are known, are they not ?
Judge: If they w ere not, perchance thou w ouldst lie
here as thou dist on earth. D idst thou invoke God’s law
on earth ? H ast thou a rig h t to call upon it here ? D ost
thou show repentance? H ast thou m ade an effort to
atone fo r the w rongs thou didst com m it in the flesh ? Thou
h a st not even in th y defense a death-bed repentance. If
the unrep en tan t sinner m ay appeal to the law w hich he
despises, then the good will suffer in vain, the evil will
escape w ith im punity. N ot a tooth for a tooth, but God’s
eternal justice ordains a day of reckoning for all thine
acts on earth. . . . Y et God is m erciful even to the wicked,
fo r He m aketh his very punishm ent th e m eans of his
im provem ent and final salvation. The godless believe
there is no God, no after-life, therefore th ey com m it all
m anner of crim es. Some who even believe in an a fte r­
life and profess to com m unicate w ith the departed, teach
th a t there is no retribution in the life beyond th e grave.
D ivine justice says the good shall have th eir rew ard in
heaven, and th e w icked shall be punished in hell. On
earth thou didst have th y riches, th y honors. Thou didst
do m uch evil. Thou didst com m it horrible crim es. . . To
e rr is hum an, to forgive divine. Jesus forgave his enemies,
b u t he sw ung th e lash in the Temple. . . D ost thou know
th is w om an?
(The Spirit of A ngelica appears.)
S pirit of M orning: O God! A ngelica!
Ju d g e: A ngelica, w h at h a st thou to say of this m an ?
Spirit of M orning: M ercy! M ercy! I cannot listen.
“
(C overs his ears w ith his hands.)
Judge: N ot only m ust thou h ear it, b u t thou shalt
h ear all th y earth ly deeds, and see them , w hether good
or bad. Thou can st not stop th y ears here.
S pirit of A ngelica: He. . . .
S pirit of M orning: Angels of m ercy! I h ear her
voice! Silence, I tell you!
Judge: Look upon her! (S p irit of M orning holds his
hands before his eyes.) In vain thou shieldest thine eyes,
thou m ust look upon her.
S pirit of M orning: T ake her aw ay! I see her! I see
her!
Judge: Speak, A ngelica, tell th is m an th a t w hich he
did unto thee.
S pirit of A ngelica: He poisoned me, he ravished me,
he robbed me, he m urdered m y father.
S pirit of M orning: A lie! A lie!
Judge: Truly, th a t w hich thou u tte re st is a lie.
(The S pirit of Fidus appears.)
Judge: Fidus, w h at h ast thou to say of th is m an?
S pirit of M orning: Holy M other of C hrist, strik e me
deaf and blind!
Spirit of Fidus: He plundered me, he plundered m y
child. H e assassinated me, he assassinated m y child. He
violated m y daughter.
S pirit of M orning: O Saints of H eaven! Pardon!
(A host is seen approaching.)
Judge: Look yonder! A pproaching, thou seest the
m iners and soldiers thou didst send to th eir graves, the
widows and orphans thou didst pillage. A non thou shalt
answ er them . Man, thou h ast m uch to answ er here. B ut
go thou now to th y sem blables.

C ount: I w as, b u t they sent me here to inspect some

A ngeles, so it happens I ’m quite alone, not a soul here
till the caretak er retu rn s to night. V ery rom antic, isn’t
it? P ra y be seated!
C ount: A nd how is the Prince of the A lps?
Lucille: He w as called back to Italy . T here is still
m uch un rest in Europe.
C ount: You know, Princess, I ’m quite jealous of your
husband—he, the husband of the w om an whom I had once
thought to m ake m istress of m y P ru ssian castle.
Lucille: Count!
C ount: Yes, I m ust tell it you now. I loved you then,
b u t your fath er told me you w ere am bitious, only a
prince could win your hand. I love you still, Lucille.
(He seizes h er hand. She rises.)
Lucille: Please let me go, Count, you frig h ten me!
C ount: C an’t you love me, L ucille? Come back w ith
me, and w e’ll retu rn to Prussia.
(She tries to d rag herself aw ay. H e rises.)
No, I w on’t let you go. You belong to me. (He a t­
tem p ts to p u t his arm s around her, she breaks loose and
rushes into the cottage. H e follows her.)
S. of M orning: Set m e free! Set m e free! H e’s kill­
ing her! Set me free!
S. of Chief: W hy don’t ye put y er irons in the fire?
M elt like b u tter! H ah! H ah! Kill yer daughter. T h at’s
nix! D idn’t ye tell me to kill Fidus an’ the strik ers?
W hen I come here, they had me up as a w itness again
ye, an’ I heard ye pisined Fidus’s daughter. You ain’t
got no kick coming. H ah! H ah! M elts like b u tter! (He
sm acks his lips.)
(C ount em erges from cottage.)
C ount: She’s m ine now! B u t w h at am I to do next?
She’s in a swoon. If som ebody comes along, they m ay
ask about her. I ought n o t to be seen here. I’ll go.
B ut I can’t leave her here. I can’t carry her like th a t
down to the m achine. . . She m ay come to any m inute. . .
She called me a cow ardly Hun! Curse her! P erhaps I
m ade a m istake. If these accursed A m ericans should
h e a r of it! And like an idiot I told her about our pro­
perties here. (He looks a t a ring on his finger.) M ajesty
gave it me to use if I failed. I t w as intended for him self
in case the A llies captured him. (He tak es the ring from
his finger, and lifts th e stone.) He told me it w as a
deadly poison, instantaneous, painless, leaving absolutely
no trace, th e discovery of our g re a t G erm an scientists.
(He lifts it slowly tow ards his m outh, w hen about to
sw allow it. he stops suddenly.) W hat a fool I am. I
haven’t failed yet. I ’ll give it her.
(He re-enters the cottage.)
S. of M orning: L et m e go! L et me go! The hell
fiend’s dishonored m y child, and now he’s poisoning her!
S. of Chief: W ell w ho’s holding y e? P u t y er brace­

honored yer child! an’ now he’s pisining her! W ho dis­
honored Fidus’s child, who pisined h e r? R eckon yer old
pard n er’s bout square w ith ye now. M elts like butter!
(He sm acks his lips.) So long, Count! Hope to see ye
again! (The C ount is seen em erging from the cottage
and disappears.) H ave a drink! ’T ain’t gone dry up
here yet. E xpect ye’d like to have a drop of th e stuff
ye left down there. I ’ll see w h at I can do fer ye. Cost
ye tw enty thousand bucks a drop, b u t th a t’s a flea bite fer
a bloated p lu to crat like you. Say, th ere’s yer m issus.
R eckon I ’ll w a it a bit!
M rs. M orning and the C ount are seen sittin g on the
porch of th e cottage.)
Mrs. M orning: If w as terrible, Count! She w as all by
herself. The doctors said it w as h e a rt failure.
C ount: I can im agine your sta te of mind, B aroness.
You m ust feel terribly lonesom e now ?
Mrs. M orning: Yes, Count, I hardly know w hat I
shall do w ith myself.
C ount: (He takes h er hand.) If you will p erm it me,
I will endeavor to m ake you fo rg et all your bereavem ents.
Mrs. M orning: O Count, this is so sudden. You m ust
give me tim e to think it over. (The C ount tak es her
his arm s.)
S. of M orning: H ell and all the fiends here, free me,

S. of C hief: W hy don’t ye p u t y er irons in the flam es ?

W hat ye call yerself, then, Mr. M orning? A lily w hite

(O ffers the cup, but drinks it him self.) W hat, ye refuse
an old friend! P erhaps, yer th irsty fe r blood? Jealous!
The green eyed m onster’s got ye, eh! Look a t ’em.

ACT 5. Scene 4.
The fro n t half of the stag e is in com plete darkness,
only the S pirit of M orning is seen looking tow ards the
bed-room w hich is illum inated w ith candles around the
corpse. E n te r the D octor w ith hypoderm ic syringe in
his hand.
D octor: H e’s gone! P erhaps the g reatest force of our
tim e. He m ade w ar and peace. Sent millions to an
untim ely grave. Men trem bled before his power. Whole
nations toiled to fill his vaults. H e owned them body
and soul, m ore com pletely th an the slave-ow ners th eir
slaves. And all by m eans of a handful of g ray m atter,
apparently no different from the brains of other m en. . . .
W hat is the secret of it all ? He had less v ital force, less
will power, less m agnetism , character, education th an
thousands of other m en who w ere his ab ject slaves. W as
it the cortical substance, or luck, chance, opportunity,
aided by the artificial arrangem ent of our m odern so­
ciety? . . . One thing is certain, a less complex social
system would m ake such an organism totally impossible.
I can w ell diagnose, though I cannot prescribe, the
an arch ist’s m ethods for purging the w orld of its organi­
zations. . . The secret m ay one day be discovered in the
psychic pow ers w hich are th reaten in g to revolutionize our
exact sciences. Till then w e m ust reckon w ithout the
psyche, deny its very existence.
(He bends over the corpse to in sert the needle. The
S pirit of M orning raises its arm s, endeavors to move
tow ards the corpse, b u t cannot.)
Spirit of M orning: Stop!
(The D octor sta rts up.)
D octor: I thought I heard a voice. (He looks around.)
I t m ust be m y im agination affected by m y m using. (He
rapidly in serts the needle and injects the virus. W ith a
cry of agony the Spirit of M orning disappears through
the tra p door. The corpse sta rts up from the bed, but
falls back im m ediately. The D octor in horror s ta rts back,
then slowly aproaches the corpse to exam ine it.)
He m ust have been in a trance.

A M ERICA ’S SLOGAN
W e can and w ill live in peace w ith the R ussian Peo­
ple, b u t not w ith the Bolshevik Czars.
O PEN W ID E T H E DOORS
There are approxim ately a million and a q u arter
D. P ’s in Europe w ho refuse to retu rn to R ussia, and less
th a n 20 per cent of them are Jew s. Surely the em pty
spaces of the w orld can absorb these persons w ith benefit
to hum anity and w ithout hardship to any country.
LINGO O F T H E LA TR IN E
Y our book-club authors are satu rate d w ith w hisky,
tobacco, profanity, and fornication. Of course this is not
new. In Zola’s days it w as dubbed “realism ”. Today it
is “true-to-life.”
Sew ers and cesspools are “true-to-life”, b u t we bury
them out of sight. E ven the cats bury th eir excrem ent.
We deodorize our bath-room s and flush our stools, we
use toilet-paper. In the H oly C ity they m icturate and
defecate in the m iddle of th e street, b u t I never noticed
an a rtis t glam orize the act, and the scarcity of toilet-
paper w as one of the hardships of the W ar.
Civilized beings use toilet-paper and kotex to g et
rid of the stench and the repulsiveness, they don’t go
about exposing it or depicting it, in so-called “lite ra tu re ”.
P a re n ts don’t copulate in fro n t of th eir children,
they don’t show them pictures or books glam orizing the
a ct of procreation, though it is “true-to-life.”
T here are m any things "true-to-life”, b u t th ey are
ugly, repulsive, execrable, and sane people keep them
out of sight, and enact them in the privacy of th eir b a th ­
room s, or the intim acy of th eir nuptial cham bers.
W hisky, tobacco, profanity, fornication, are not the
m edia of g re a t a rt or of g re a t artists.
W hisky-sw illers and cigarette-hounds deodorize
th eir breaths w ith gum . The ladies who buy and pro­
duce our m odern “lite ra tu re ” hide th eir sm ells under
perfum es; th eir angularities under padding, foundations;
th eir fa t under corsets, girdles, supports, braces, boning;
th eir fla t b reasts under brassieres, bust-cups; th eir cloven
hoofs above high heels and under tig h t uppers; th eir de­
form ities under styles and fashions; their sallow ness un­
der attra c tiv e colors; th eir lack of hips under bustles, e tc .;
th eir ugliness under m ake-up, so th a t th e proverb has
changed from B eauty is skin-deep to paint-deep.
W hy not use the sam e technic in th eir “lite ra tu re ” ?
P a rt of our so-called “lite ra tu re ”, and perhaps the
m ost degenerating, are the m ovie-scripts being concocted
in Hollywood by Bolsheviks. To corrupt the A m erican
people, these B olsheviks glorify w hisky, tobacco, profan­
ity, fornication, and th eir own pu trid divorces.
T here is only one w ay to destroy th is ulcer. The
A m erican people them selves and th eir churches m ust
dem and a movie center, w here B olsheviks will
not be hired or perm itted to w rite nor to enact in th eir
own lives th eir vices, nor to pollute and destroy the
A m erican people w ith w hisky, tobacco, profanity, forni­
cation, and divorce.
T here are fa r b etter script-w riters and screen-
a rtists in A m erica th an our book-club protegees and our
movie “sta rs” prom oted by our m oguls, b u t they are sup­
pressed, system atically and ruthlessly, by the B olsheviks
who in filtrate into power.
A ccordingly, I have not considered it m y duty to
glorify w hisky, tobacco, profanity, and fornication to
assure the sale of this book. The places for them are
Hollywood, ladies’ cocktail bars, m en’s saloons, and the
latrines.

5. IM M AN UEL SCIENCE
Also know n as T heotherapy or Psychotherapy.
Shows th a t m iraculous cures are possible, th a t every
hom e can be a m iracle shrine. Teaches you how.
H elps you and your physician and surgeon. M edicine
and surgery w ithout nursing is only half effective, and
vice versa. Sim ilarly, m edicine and surgery w ithout
Im m anuel Science is only half effective, and vice versa.
If you doubt m y word, go to m ost of our hospitals oper­
ated by religious orders, C atholic, P ro testan t, Jew ish, and
you will find devout m en and w om en offering up prayers
fo r the patients, as adjunctive tre a tm e n t to the m inis­
tratio n s of th e physicians and surgeons.
W hat is Im m anuel Science? A ccording to the un­
broken traditions of religious schools in th e E ast, it is
the m ethod of healing used by E lijah, Jesus, and by all
the other healers m entioned in the Old and New T esta­
m ents.
I t is not a substitute for, b u t an adju n ct to reg u lar
medicine and surgery. In fa c t it co-operates w hole­
heartedly w ith doctors of medicine. Jesus used rem edial
ag en ts such as w ater, m ud and spittle.
“The Lord h a th created m edicines out of the earth,
and he th a t is w ise will not abhor them . . . w ith such
doth he heal men, and ta k e th aw ay th eir pain.”
I t is not suggestion or auto-suggestion. I t does not
teach th a t disease is a delusion. I t teaches exactly the
opposite. D isease is the resu lt of violated law —so stated
by the M aker of all law.
M edicine and surgery w hen used ethically and scien­
tifically, are instrum ents of God. They are adjuncts of
n atu re as is Im m anuel Science.
The superconscious is not credulous. I t will not be­
lieve a lie. If the body is sick, the superconscious know s
it, and no am ount of suggestion will m ake it believe th a t
its sickness is only im agination.
The superconscious or soul is, how ever, obedient and
will com prehend and cooperate w ith a categorical im ­
perative. A categorical im perative to th e central nervous
system sends out m illions of little physicians found in the
body and m any internal secretions, on errands of m ercy
and Healing. Im m anuel Science supplies through the
nervous system th is categorical im perative to the c^hs
and to the endocrine elands, and then in accordance w ith
divide law . h ealth follows.

Theotherapy, God’s Science of H ealing, and Spirit-
oiogy. th e Science of Snirit. D escribes the cosmic ravs
th a t are beam ed around the universe to counteract the ills

RAD IO M IRA CLE SH R IN E
All rig h ts reserved including the rig h t of reproduction
in whole or in p a rt in any form .
C opyright, 1947, by Prince Im m anuel.
This is Dr. Im m anuel of the w orld’s only Radio
M iracle Shrine. T hrough the telekinetic w aves broadcast
by YHW H, the P atro n Pow er of this station, and the
faith of the sick and th eir friends and relatives, a m ir­
acle of healing can happen to anyone who tunes in to th is
station. This is not an am usem ent program , this is a
solem n occasion, and if you w an t results do not tre a t this
opportunity lightly. Be serious. E verything depends on
your attitude.
Now bring the sick to the radio. B ring them in
chairs or beds, if they cannot w alk. O r tak e the radio to
them . Place a pillow in fro n t of a chair for the sick to
kneel on, if he is able. If he is n o t able to kneel, le t him
listen carefully and reverently. Now I am speaking to
the sick:
Do not th in k of anything in p articular, have only
faith. Ju s t relax and breathe deeply. You are now in
th e posture of prayer. You are going to ask YHW H to
heal you of your ills. YHW H has com m anded us to kneel
in this w ay and has prom ised to heal us if we are
obedient to H is com m ands. If you have n o t had su f­
ficient faith in the past, from now on you w ill have the
necessary faith, and you will obey in spite of yourself.
R em ain on your knees and clasp your hands tightly.
All of you can do this. Those who are n o t kneeling can
clasp th eir hands.
Y our body has obeyed your soul, b u t th a t is not su f­
ficient. I t is necessary th a t you strengthen your faith
and obedience by additional trials. You are in the pos­
