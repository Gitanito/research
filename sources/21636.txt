IN APPRECIATION
After a life devoted wholly to the service of his
feliowkind, Winchester Stevens, the narrator of
these phenomena, passed to the Summerland Decem-
ber 9, 1885, at the age of sixty-three years.
Honest and candid, kindly of heart and pure in
thought, of great beneficence, and of rare skill in his
profession, enriched by years of experience, the good
deeds and the influence of Dr. Stevens are still sens-
ed in the common heart of the world, in lives made
better.

INTRODUCTION
By J. M. Peebles, M.D., M.A.
Not only is this an age of investigation, research
and original discoveries, but it is an age of skepti-
cism and persistent doubt touching all such realities
as relate to the invisible. The sense perceptions
are far more to the front than the aspirational, up>
looking, spiritual faculties. Sad to say, the masses
live more in the back and selfish side brains than in
the coronal soul-parlors open to spiritual visitants
and angelic impressions.
Had not the inspirational and erudite B. F. Austin,
A.M., D.D., of Rochester, N. Y., been psychically
directed to the preservation of these remarkable
phenomena occurring in the Roff family, Watseka,
III., they would, no doubt, have been relegated to
the hazy dream-land of myth, companion of the
martyred Man of Nazareth, the Swiss William Tell,
the Indian Pocohontas, Joan of Arc and others not-
ed for strange, astounding phenomena. There are
those in our midst who will not only question the
knowledge of their peers, but they will actually in-
vent miracles to get rid of the plain truth—a truth
testified to by the wisdom of the ages: that the
spirits of our dead are alive, and that under given
conditions they can not only bring us living mes-
sages, but as in the case of Mary Roff, they can
temporarily inhabit another body, and dwell for a
time for a special purpose in the earthly home of
her friends, to their almost unbounded joy.
Through the medical treatment of Mr. Roff, it
d^ was my privilege to not only visit Watseka, III., but
to become personally acquainted with the Roff
family—a family not only highly respected, but
moving in what was denominated the "first society."
And further, I was honored by knowing personally

8 THE WATSEKA WONDER
Dr. E. W. Stevens, a most excellent and cultured
gentleman, gifted with strong magnetic power;
which power was intensified by a smypathizing
circle of influencing spirits. As is well known, this
Dr. Stevens was a Spiritualist and a conscientious
and deeply religious man, honored by all who per-
sonally knew^ him.
The remarkable facts related in this book, "The
Watseka Wonder," embodying the psychic relations
between Lurancy and Mary, were so new that many
Spiritualists held it was impossoble for one spirit to
enter into the vacated body of a living mortal and
manifest through it. And there are certain Spirit-
ualistic laggards to this day, who talk of the "im-
possible" upon this and kindred matters.
But can a spirit in the spiritual spheres, under
any conditions, enter into the vacated body of a liv-
ing mortal and manifest through the forty-two
phrenological brain organs, the sinews, muscles and
nerves—was this ever done?
What Is The Spirit?
Poets and prophets are ever in advance of the
priests. This was true in Hebraic times, and it is
true today. That old prophet who compiled the
Book of Proverbs exclaimed in an inspirational
moment: **The spirit of man is the candle of the
Lord." And it is the office-work of the candle, or
lamp, to light the room and its furniture. So the
conscious spirit, symbolized by the candle-lights,
manifests through the forty-two brain organs,
through fleshly body of muscles, sinews, nerves.
Remember that the body is a bit of transitory ma-
chinery, conceived and built up by the conscious
intelligent spirit; but this spirit-builder in the
process of construction did not so build and fixedly
mortise itself into the body that it could escape
only through death. This would be a living, suicid-

ly wedged and fixed in a few feet of mortality. It
can in dreams and visions temporarily leave the
body, visiting different parts of this planet. Mars
and the stars that glitter and shimmer above us.
And so, Lurancy Vennum having through wise iL
guides left her body, Mary, of the Roff family,
actually left the spiritual world and, descending,
dwelt for a time in the body of Lurancy, taking it
to her former home and enjoying the sweets of
love, and friendship, and family relations. She
virtually lived several months in two worlds, in the
earth and in the spirit land; vibrating between, en-
joying both, and receiving lessons in the meantime
from the angels that delight to do the Father's will.
There was no "double consciousness'' in this case.
There is in no case. The consciousness is a unit.
Such phrases as "duplex consciousness," "seven-
fold personalities," and the "super-conscious sub-
liminal," while explaining nothing, confuse and
darken speech.
Once I asked a very exalted spirit intelligence
these questions:
Can you, while entrancing this medium, see the real spirit?
No, I can not. I only sense and see the spiritual body.
When entrancing a mortal in the body, do you cause the
owner of the body to vacate it?
Not necessarily; entrancement is little more than mesmeric
influence.
Can you really see—can you describe the unfleshed, unclothed
spirit of this body?
I cannot. The most that I can say through this instrument,
is that it seems to be a distinct entity, looking like a fiery diamond
—a brilliant point of dazzling brightness shining through a very
ethereal white fluid, connected in some way, sympathetically and
vibratorially, with the body that it owns.*

EDITORIAL NOTE
In no one line of human activity today is the prog-
ress of humanity more marked than in the increas-
ed interest of the people in matters pertaining to
our mental and spiritual powers, and their unfold-
ment. This is a most hopeful sign of the times,
and betokens the fact that, while outwardly we are
much given over to materialism, that in our newer
and real life we are mounting upward towards
"nobler things.'*
A thousand signs of the times indicate the sig-
nificant fact that, despite the mad rush for money
and power of our commercial and political life, a
great spiritual hunger has come upon the soul of
humanity, and one that no amount of material food
can ever satiate. We have the authority of the
great Nazarene teacher for saying that spiritual
hunger is a blessing, and that il^ must and will find
ample satisfaction.
No better indicator of public opinion and of the
trend of thought and desire of the people can be
found, than the public press; and this indicates a
rapidly increasing interest in all matters of psychic
research and questions regarding man's present
and future unfoldment. The leading dailies of the
great cities are now vying with one another in at-
tempts to supply the ever-increasing demand for
authentic facts and incidents bearing on the inter-
communion of the two worlds. The great mass of
attested incidents collected by the Society for
Psychical Research has—as all must see—a direct
relation to the Problem of Immortality. The great
magazines—a few years since rigidly closed to all
occult matters—are now finding it to their interest
to supply their readers with the latest and best in
psychic research. And the end is not yet.

12 THE WATSEKA WONDER
No more flitting time could have been chosen,
therefore, for bringing out a new and enlarged edi-
tion of the "Watseka Wonder," a story of actual,
yet most wonderful happenings in Watseka, Illinois,
U. S. A., over fifty years ago, which is attested
by such a multiude of credible w^itnesses—some of
them living today—that to doubt the story is to im-
peach all human testimony.
The facts have been inquired into by many lead-
ing psychologists and psychic researchers, includ-
ing the late Dr. Richard Hodgson, with but one re-
sult: a ready acknowledgment of the authentic
character of the story. If the story be true, earth
and heaven are not far separated; mortals and
spirits do communicate, and the principal conten-
tions of the Spiritual Philosophy are indisputably
established.
We send forth the new edition with an Introduc-
tion by the venerable Dr. James M. Peebles of
Battle Creek, Mich., who knew the chief characters
of the story, and Reminiscences of the three months'
visit of Mary Roff, in spirit, to the home of her peo-
ple in the borrowed body of Lurancy Vennum, by
Mrs. H. H. Alter, of Watseka, 111., her sister, with
the hope that it may interest and instruct humanity
and help to solve the problem: "If a man die shall
he live again?"

The following is a true narrative, and as full as
the facts collected from the parents and relatives
of the parties named herein and observations made
by the writer, will warrant.
14 THE WATSEKA WONDER
Thomas J. Vennum was bom May 7, 1832, in
Washington Co., Penn. ; Lurinda J. Smith (his
wife), was born October 14, 1837, in St. Joseph
Co., Ind. They were married in Fayette Co., low^a,
December 2, 1855.
Mary Lurancy Vennum, daughter of the above
named Thomas and Lurinda J. Vennum, was bom
April 16, 1864, in Midford township seven miles
south of Watseka.
The family moved to Iowa, July 12, 1864, and
returned to the vicinity eight miles from Watseka,
in October, 1865. In August, 1866, they removed
to Milford, twelve miles south of Watseka, and re-
manied there till March 1, 1870; then moved out
two and one half miles from Milford until April 1,
1871, when they moved into Watseka, locating
about forty rods from the residence of A. B. Roff,
the spirit daughter of whom, according to all the
facts and representations every way tested, is the
principal character in this remarkable narrative.
The family remained at this place during the sum-

Thomas J. Vennum was born May 7, 1832, in
Washington Co., Penn.; Lurinda J. Smith (his
wife), was born October 14, 1837, in St. Joseph
Co., Ind. They were married in Fayette Co., Iowa,
December 2, 1855.
Mary Lurancy Vennum, daughter of the above
named Thomas and Lurinda J. Vennum, was born
April 16, 1864, in Midford township seven miles
south of Watseka.
The family moved to Iowa, July 12, 1864, and
returned to the vicinity eight miles from Watseka,
in 0ctober, 1865. In August, 1866, they removed
to Milford, twelve miles south of Watseka, and re-
manied there till March 1, 1870; then moved out
two and one half miles from Milford until April 1,
1871, when they moved into Watseka, locating
about forty rods from the residence of A. B. Roff,
the spirit daughter of whom, according to all the
facts and representations every way tested, is the
principal character in this remarkable narrative.
The family remained at this place during the sum-
mer. The only acquaintance ever had been be-
tween the two families during the season, was
simply one brief call of Mrs. Roff, for a few minutes,
on Mrs. Vennum, which call was never returned;
and a formal speaking acquaintance between the
two gentlemen. Since 1871, the Vennum family
had lived entirely away from the vicinity of Mr.
Roff's, and never nearer than now, on extreme op-
posite limits of the city.
"Rancy," as she was familiarly called, had never
been sick, save a light run of measles in 1873. A

to her. Her
mother went to bed with her, after which she rest-
ed and slept the rest of the night.
On the eleventh day of July, 1877, Lurancy had )^
been sewing carpet a part of the afternoon, when
at about six o'clock she laid by her work, as her
mother said: **Lurancy, you had better commence
getting supper." The girl replied: **Ma, I feel bad;
I feel so queer," and placing her hand on her left
breast, she immediately went into what seemed
like a fit, falling heavily on the floor, lying ap-
parently dead, every muscle becoming suddenly
rigid. Thus she lay five hours. On returning to con-
sciousness she had said she felt "very strange and
queer." The remainder of the night she rested
well. The next day the rigid state returned, and
passing beyond the rigidity, her mind took cogni-
zance of two states of being at the same time. Ly-
ing as if dead, she spoke freely, telling the family
what persons and spirits she could see, describing
them and calling some of them by name. Among
those mentioned w^ere her sister and brother, for
she exclaimed, Oh, motherl can't you see little
Laura and Bertie? They are so beautiful!" etc.,
etc. Bertie died when Lurancy was but three years
old.
She had many of these trances, describing heav-
en and the spirits, or the angels as she called them.
Sometime in September she became free from them
and seemed to the family to be quite w^ell again.
On the twenty-seventh day of November, 1877,
she was attacked with a most violent pain in her
stomach, some five or six times a day; for tw^o weeks
she had the most excruciating pains. In these pain-
ful paroxysms, she would double herself back until
her head and feet actually touched. At the end of
two weeks, or about the eleventh of December, in
these distressed attacks, she became unconscious

and passed into a queer trance, and, as at former
times, would describe heaven and spirits, often call-
ing them angels. "^
From this time on until the first of February,
1878, she would have these trances and sometimes
a seemingly real obsession, from three to eight and
sometimes as many as twelve times a day, lasting
from one to eight hours, occasionally passing into
that state of ecstasy , when as Lurancy, she claim-
ed to be in heaven.
During the time recorded, up to about the middle
of January, 1878, she had been under the care of
Dr. L. N. Pitwood in the summer and Dr. Jewett
during the winter. These M. D.*s are both eminent
allopathic practitioners, and residents of Watseka.
Mrs. Allison, Mrs. Jolly and other relatives and
friends believed her insane. The Rev. B. M. Baker,
the Methodist minister in charge at Watseka wrote
to the insane asylum to ascertain if the girl could
be received there. It seemed to be the general
feeling among all the friends save the parents and
a few who were only sympathetic observers and
thinkers, that the girl should go to the asylum.

bosom of an affectionate family, to imprison her
among maniacs, to be ruled and cared for by ignor-

and Christian spirit, to counsel with the parents
and advise other treatment, different from any that
had been administered.

Mr. Roff after much persuation, obtained the

with him Dr. E. W. Stevens, of Janesville, Wis., to
investigate the case. Dr. Stevens, who, for several
months, at frequent intervals, had been in the city
and a silent listener to the scoffs and scandals
thrown out towards the Spiritualists on account of
their opinions regarding the case, and the universal
foment of mind in the city over it, was formally in-
vited by Mr. Vennum, through Mr. Roff to visit the
family.
On the afternoon of January 31 1878, the two
gentlemen repaired to Mr. Vennum's residence, a
little out of the city. Dr. Stevens, an entire strang-

four o'clock p. m. ; no other persons present but the
family. The girl sat near the stove, in a common
chair, her elbows on her knees, her hands under her
chin, feet curled up on the chair, eyes staring, look-

time in silence, until Dr. Stevens moved his chair,

She refused to be touched, even to shake hands,
and was reticent and sullen with all save the doc-

was a Spiritual doctor and would understand her.
When he asked her name she quickly replied:

habits and morals by questions like the following:

etc. She then asked to have the same questions put
to Mr. Roff. She declined to ask them direct, her-
self, but through the doctor. They must also be
repeated through him to Mr. Vennum; making the
w^hile, some very unpleasant retorts.

visitors arose to depart, she also arose, flung up
her hands and fell upon the floor, straight, stiff and
rigid, as sensitives fall with the "power" in Meth-

her, if she must be controlled, if it would not be
better, if it were possible, to have a higher, purer,
happier, and more intelligent or rational control.
She said she would rather, if it could be so. Then
on being advised, she looked about and inquired
of those she saw, and described, and named, to find
some one who would prevent the cruel and insane
ones from returning to annoy her and the family.

wards: **She seems like a child real homesick,
w^anting to see her pa and ma and her brothers."
It now^ became necessary in the relation of this
narrative to give a brief sketch of the life of Mary
Roff.
Mary Roff, daughter of Asa D. and Ann Roff, was
born on the eighth day of October, 1846, in Warren
Co., Ind. The family moved in November of the
same year to Williamsport, Ind., thence in Septem-
ber, 1847, to Middleport, 111., where they resided
till June, 1857, when they removed to Victoria,
Texas, in search of relief for a sick child. In March,
1858, they returned to Oilman and remained there
and at Onarga, 111., till the building of the Toledo,
Poeria and Warsaw Railroad, when they returned
to Middleport, November 8, 1859, and built the first
house in the new town of South Middleport which
is now part of the City of Watseka, where they
still reside.
In the spring of 1847, when about six months old,
Mary was taken sick and had a fit, in which she re-
mained several hours. After the fit, she became
conscious and lay several days without the family
having much hope of her recovery. In two or three
weeks she seemed to have entirely recovered. A
few weeks later she acted, on one occasion, like a
child going into a fit. The pupils of her eyes dilat-
ed, the muscles slightly twitched; but it only lasted
a few moments. From the age of about six months,
she had these spells as described, once in from three
to five w^eeks, all the time increasing in force and
violence, until her tenth year, when they proved to
be real fits, having from one to three and some-
times four or five of them within a period of three
or four days, when they would cease, and she
would enjoy good health until the next period ap-
proached. At these times, she for a few days would

wards: "She seems like a child real homesick,
wanting to see her pa and ma and her brothers."
It now became necessary in the relation of this
narrative to give a brief sketch of the life of Mary
Roff.
Mary Roff, daughter of Asa D. and Ann Rolf, was
born on the eighth day of October, 1846, in Warren
Co., Ind. The family moved in November of the
same year to Williamsport, Ind., thence in Septem-
ber, 1847, to Middleport, Ill., where they resided
till June, 1857, when they removed to Victoria,
Texas, in search of relief for a sick child. ln March,
1858, they returned to Gilman and remained there
and at Onarga, Ill., till the building of the Toledo,
Poeria and Warsaw Railroad, when they returned
to Middleport, November 8, 1859, and built the Hrst
house in the new town of South Middleport which
is now part of the City of Watseka, where they
still reside.
In the spring of 1847, when about six months old,
Mary was taken sick and had a fit, in which she re-
mained several hours. After the fit, she became
conscious and lay several days without the family
having much hope of her recovery. In two or three
weeks she seemed to have entirely recovered. A
few weeks later she acted, on one occasion, like a
child going into a fit. The pupils of her eyes dilat-
ed, the muscles slightly twitched; but it only lasted
a few moments. From the age of about six months,
she had these spells as described, once in from three
to five weeks, all the time increasing in force and
violence, until her tenth year, when they proved to
be real fits, having from one to three and some-
times four or live of them within a period of three
or four days, when they would cease, and she
would enjoy good health until the next period ap-
proached. At these times, she for a few days would
THE WATSEKA WONDER 23
seem sad and despondent, in which mood she would
sing and play the most solemn music (for with all
the rest of her studies, in which she was consider-
ed well advanced, she had learned music), and
almost always would sing that beautiful song, *'We
Are Coming, Sister Mary," which was a favorite
with her.
When she was fifteen years old, and the violence
of the fits had increased, the parents said they
could see her mind was affected during the melan-
choly periods prior to the fits. Dr. Jesse Bennett,
now residing at Sparta, Wis., and Dr. Franklin
Blades, now Judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit
of Illinois, and resident of Watseka, were employ-
ed to attend her. Dr. N. S. Davis, of Chicago, and
several other prominent physicians, had examined
her. They kept her in the water cure at Peoria,
111., under the care of Dr. Nevins, for eighte^
months, but all to no purpose.
In the summer of 1864 she seemed to have almost
a mania for bleeding herself for the relief, as she
said, **of the lump of pain in the head." Drs.
Fowler, Secrets and Pitwood were called and ap-
plied leeches. She would apply them herself to her
temples, and liked them treating them like little
pets, until she seemed sound and well.
On Saturday morning, July 16, 1864, in one of
her despondent moods, she secretly took a knife
with her to the back yard, and cut her arm terrib-
ly, until bleeding excessively, she fainted. This oc-
cured about nine o'clock a. m. She remained un-
conscious till two o'clock p. m., when she became
a raving maniac of the most violent kind, in which
condition she remained five days and nights, requir-
ing almost constantly the services of five of the
most able bodied men to hold her on the bed,
although her weight was only about one hundred
pounds, and she had lost nearly all her blood.

When she ceased raving, she looked and acted
quite natural and well, and could do everything
she desired as readily and properly as at any
time in her life. Yet she seemed to know no one,
and could not recognize the presence of persons
at all, although the house was nearly filled with
people night and day. She had no sense whatever
of sight, feeling or hearing in a natural way, as
was proved by every test that could be applied.
, She could read blindfolded, and do everything as

readily as when in health by her natural sight. She
would dress, stand before the glass, open and
search draw^ers, pick up loose pins, do any and all
things readily and without annoyance, under heavy
blindfoldings.
Near the time, in 1864, when she cut her arm,
while blindfolded she took Dr. Trail's encyclopedia,
turned to the index, traced the column till she came
to the word "blood,'* then turned to the page indi-
cated and read the subject through. On another
occasion she took a box of her letters received from
her friends, and sat down, heavily blindfolded by
critical, intelligent, investigating gentlemen, ex-
amined and read them w^ithout error or hesitancy.
When Rev. J. H. Rhea, Editor A. J. Smith, Mr. Roff
and others misplaced and promiscuously arranged
some of their own letters with Mary's she at once
proceeded to correctly draw out the intruded let-
ters and examine them. If wrong side up she
would quickly turn them, and read the address there-
on, and throw violently away every letter not her
own; and re-arrange twenty or thirty letters in the
order she desired to have them. Rev. J. H. Rhea was
the Methodist minister in charge at the time; A. G.
Smith was editor of the Iroquois County **Republi-
can," now editor of the Danville (111.) **Times."
She was also investigated by all the prominent
citizens of Watseka at that time.

With the physicians her peculiar state or con-
dition was called catalepsy. With the clergy it was
one of the mysteries of God's providence, with
which we should have little to do. With editors,
who are obliged to be wise or silent, it was fits or
some unaccountable phenomenon. All, w^ith untir-
ing effort, tried to solve the mystery and learn what
it was that produced such strange and wonderful
manifestations. The editor of the Danville "Times,"
in a recent issue writes:
Now as to Mary Roff, it was our fortune to know the sweet
girl, who was herself a cataleptic, and who died twelve years ago.
Disease dethroned her reason and maddened her brain until she
sought her own and others' lives, and the modest young lady was
transformed into a screaming maniac. She had periods of ex-
emption from raving, and thus her aberrant mind conceived fan-
cies of the queerest hue, creating the most impossible beings for
associates, and conversing w^ith them, she maintained her own
side of the conversation in a usual tone of voice, while imagination
supplied her created associates with language and intelligence.
When in this condition, her father and mother asserted the dis-
covery that Mary could read a book with its lids closed, and they
desired us to test the correctness of what they claimed. We there-
fore took from our side pocket a letter inclosed in an envelope,
and holding it before her bandaged eyes, said to her, 'Mary, read
the signature to that letter.' Immediately the proper name was
pronounced.
After remaining in the clairvoyant state above
related for three or four days, she came again to
her normal condition and in good health as she
usually was, except the fits. From this time she
continued as she had been prior to cutting her arm.
Her fits increased, and her parents were advised
to place her in the insane asylem.
On July 5 1845, while her parents were at Peona,
111., on a three days* visit, she ate a hearty break-
fast, and soon thereafter lay dow^n on her bed, and
in her usual health went to sleep. In a few minutes
she was heard to scream, as was usual on taking a
fit. On approaching her bedside, they found her in
a fit, and in a few^ moments she expired.

it was first seen that Mary Roff had control of
Lurancy*s body, and teasing to go home. Could it
be possible the gulf of death had been bridged! the
gate* of heaven left open? Had Mary, like Moses
and Elias, returned to a transfiguration? Or, like
the spirit of "one of the prophets,** had she come
w^ith revelation to the grotto of darkness in this
benighted Patmos? Were the unnumbered facts
of scriptural ages repeating themselves now^? Can
we say with Job, "A spirit passed before my face?"
Ezekiel and Isaiah talked with the departed, Saul
conversed w^ith Samuel, Paul and the shepherds

From the wild, angry, ungovernable girl, to be

watch-care of almost frantic parents; or the rigid,
corpse-like cataleptic, as believed, the girl has now

none of the family, but constantly pleading to go
home. The best wisdom of the family was used to
convince her that she was at home, and must re-

only found contentment in going back to heaven,
as she said, for short visits.
About a week after she took control of the body,
Mrs. A. B. Roff and her daughter, Mrs. Minerva

changie, went to see the girl. As they came in sight,
far down the street, Mary, looking out of the win-

them. From this time on she seemed more home-
sick than before. At times she seemed almost fran-
tic to go home. Finally some friends of the family
insisted on their sending her to Mr. Ro£f*s, which
they reluctantly consented to do; reluctantly be-
cause the girl was so much trouble and care, as she
had been all winter; so much so that Mrs. Vennum
was nearly prostrated, and could not have surviv-
ed the care and anxiety many months longer, under
the same state of affairs. They felt that it would
be an imposition to send the girl to be cared for by
strangers, and especially so by Mrs. Roff, as she was
not able to take charge of and care for a girl that
made so much trouble as this one had for Mrs.
Vennum.
Mr. and Mrs. Roff, with their hearts ever full of
the milk of human kindness, more ready to forgive
than to censure, and braving the sneers and taunt-
ing innuendoes of an uneducated bigotry, with no
other motive but one of mercy and kindness, opened
their doors and hearts to receive the unfortunate
girl with her new control, having no hope or desire
for reward but in the sense of a just sympathy for
right and truth. They remembered the precept,
'Torget not to entertain strangers, for thereby
some have entertained angels."
On the eleventh day of February, 1878, they sent
the girl to Mr. RoJfiF*s, where she met her '*pa and
ma," and each member of the family, with the
most gratifying expressions of love and affection,
by words and embraces. On being asked how long
she would stay, she said, "The angels will let me
stay till sometime in May;" and she made it her
home there till May twenty-first three months and
ten days, a happy contented daughter and sister in
a borrow^ed body.
After the girl was at Mr. Roff's, the Rev. Mr.
Baker said to Mr. Vennum, '^I think you will see

she would be more thouble than ever. Another
relative, more religious than humane, said, *'I would

her go to Roff^s and be made a Spiritualist.** Dr.

would say, with a non-committal air, **What strange

wonderful perceptions, would say, "It is all put

such opinions had ever called to see the girl, or
derived any information from those in charge of
her.
The girl now in her new home, seemed perfectly
happy and content, know^ing every person and

household duties, assisting in the general work of
the family as a faithful, prudent daughter might
be supposed to do, singing, reading or conversing
as opportunity offered, upon all matters of private
or general interest to the family.
Three days after she came to Mr. Roff's, while
looking at him and seeming to have been in a sort
of retrospective revery, she asked, "Pa, who was it
that used to say ^confound it?' " and laughing very
heartily when she saw that he understood it to be
himself, that being a common expression of his in
the time of her girlhood, twelve years ago.
One day she met an old friend and neighbor of
Mr. Roff, who was a widow when Mary was a girl
at home. Some years since the lady married a Mr.
Wagoner, with whom she yet lives. But when she
met Mrs. Wagoner she clasped her around the neck,
and said, **0 Mary Lord, you lock so very natural,
and have changed the least of any one I have seen
since I came back." Mrs. Lord was in no way re-
lated to the Vennum family, and lived close by
them, but Mary could only call her by the name by
w^hich she knew^ her fifteen years ago and could
not seem to realize that she was married. Mrs.
Lord lived just across the street from Mr. Roff's for
several years, prior and up to within a few months
of Mary's death; both being memebrs of the same
Methodist church, they were very intimate.
Some days after Mary was settled in her new
home, Mrs. Parker, who lived neighbor to the Roff's
in Middleport in 1852, and next door to them in
Watseka in 1860, came in with her daughter-in-

both of the ladies, calling Mrs. Parker "Auntie

30 THE WATSEKA WONDER
Mrs. Parker says that it was the first allusion made
to that matter, nothing having been said by any one
on that subject, and says that Mary and Minerva
used to come to their house and sit and sing, ^^Mary
had a little lamb," etc. Mrs. Dr. Alter (Minerva)
says she remembers it well. This was when Mr.
RofF kept the postoffice, and could not have been
later than 1852, and twelve years before Lurancy
w^as bom.
One evening in the latter part of March, Mr. RofF
w^as sitting in the room waiting for tea, and read-

ed Mrs. RofF if she could find a certain velvet head-
dress that Mary used to wear the last year before
she died. If so, to lay it on the stand and say noth-
ing about it, to see if Mary would recognize it.
Mrs. RofF readily found and laid it on the stand.
The girl soon came in and immediately exclaimed
as she approached the stand: "Oh, there is my
head-dress I wore when my hair was short!" She
then asked "Ma where is my box of letters? Have
you got them yet?" Mrs RofF replied, "Yes, Mary,
I have some of them." She at once got the box with
many letters in it. As Mary began to examine them
she said, **Oh, Ma, here is a collar I tatted! Ma,
why did you not show to me my letters and things
before?" The collar had been preserved among
the relics of the lamented child as one of the beau-
tiful things her fingers had wrought before Lurancy
was born; and so Mary continually recognized
every little incident of her girlhood.
It will be remembered that the family moved to
Texas in 1857. Mr. Roff asked Mary if she re-
membered moving to Texas or anything about it.
**Ye8, pa, and I remember crossing Red River and
of seeing a great many Indians, and I remember
Mrs. Reeder*s girls, who were in our company."
And thus she from time to time made first mention
30 THE WATSEKA WONDER
Mrs. Parker says that it was the first allusion made
to that matter, nothing having been said by any one
on that subject, and says that Mary and Minerva
used to come to their house and sit and sing, "Mary
had a little lamb," etc. Mrs. Dr. Alter (Minerva)
says she remembers it well. This was when Mr.
Roff kept the postoffice, and could not have been
later than 1852, and twelve years before Lurancy
was born.
One evening in the latter part of March, Mr. Roff
was sitting in the room waiting for tea, and read-
ing the paper, Mary being out in the yard. He ask-
ed Mrs. Roff if she could find a certain velvet head-
dress that Mary used to wear the last year before
she died. If so, to lay it on the stand and say noth-
ing about it, to see if Mary would recognize it.
Mrs. Rolf readily found and laid it on the stand.
The girl soon came in and immediately exclaimed
as she approached the stand: "Oh, there is my
head-dress I wore when my hair was short!" She
then asked "Ma where is my box of letters? Have
you got them yet?" Mrs Roff replied, "Yes, Mary,
I have some of them." She at once got the box with
many letters in it. As Mary began to examine them
she said, "Oh, Ma, here is a collar I tatted! Ma,

And thus she from time to time made first mention

addressed the writer as follows:
"You know how we took the poor, dear girl Lurancy (Mary).

The child has often said she likes Dr. Stevens next tb
her father, because he opened the gate for her to come
in, and because he has done so much for her father and
mother, and her brothers, and for Lurancy's body, and
feeling that gratitude, she wrote him a letter by permis-

which she said:

It may have been said it was frequently the case that
when Mary went to heaven, as she called it, other spirits
sometimes, by permission, would come and present them-
selves, and speak freely their own language and senti-

of a communication through another young lady at his
house: ....
A lady came through at our house, who claimed to
have have lived and died in Tennessee, and says she was afflicted
from eight years of age till tw^enty-five, when she died w^ith a simi-
lar disease, and in a similar way that Mary died. She says that
Mary has control of Lurancy Vennum, and will retain control until
she is restored to her normal condition, when Mary will leave.
Mary is happy as a lark, and gives daily, almost hourly, proofs
of being Mary's intelligence. She don't recognize Lurancy's fami-
ly or friends at all. She knows and recognizes everything that
our Mary used to know, and nothing w^hatever of what the Vennum

Mrs. Dr. Alter, under date of April 16, 1878, writes

but she says she will be often with us. She says Lurancy is a

the door Mrs. Vennum, Lurancy's mother, looking on the scene.
The girl then bade an affectionate good-by to Frank; A. B. R.
asks: How long will you stay?" She replies, "Till two or three
o'clock." Mrs. Vennum then said to Mr. Roff: "If she does not

"Where am I? I was never here before."
Mrs. Roff replied:

She was then asked if she felt any pain in her
breast. (This was during the period that Mery was

"No, but Mary did.**
In about five minutes the change was again made,

Old Town, and the family so understood it. But
at about nine and a half o'clock the same evening,
Dr. Stevens returned unannounced to Mr. Marsh's,
Mr. Roff's next neighbor, for the night. At two
o'clock in the morning Frank w^as attacked w^ith
something like a spasm and congestive chill, which
almost distroyed his consciousness. Mary at once
saw^ the situation as predicted, and said, "Send to
Mrs. Marsh's for Dr. Stevens." *'No, Dr. Stevens
is at Old Town," said the family. **No," said Mary,
*'he is at Mr. Marsh's; go quick for him, pa." Mr.
Roff called, and the doctor, as Mary said, was at Mr.
Marsh's. On his arrival at the sick bed, Mary had
entire control of the case. She had made Mrs. Roff
sit down; had provided hot water and cloths and
other necessaries, and was doing all that could be
done for Frank. The doctor seconded her efforts
and allowed her to continue. She saved her brother,
but never made a move after the doctor's arrival,
w^ithout his co-operation or advice.
Mary often spoke of seeing the children of Dr.
Stevens in heaven, w^ho were about her age and of
longer residence there than herself. She said she
was with them much, and went to his home with him.
She correctly described his home, the rooms and
furniture, gave the names and ages of his children,
and as evidence of her truthfulness, told of a re-
markable experience of Mrs. E. M. Wood, one of
the doctor's married daughter, which, on account

declared that her brother Frank must be carefully
watched the coming night, for he would be taken
very sick, and would die if not properly cared for.
At the time of this announcement he was in his
usual heatlh, and engaged with the Roff Bros.'
band of music up town. The same evening, Dr.
Stevens had been in to see the family, and on leav-
ing was to go directly to Mrs. Hawks, far off in the

relatives was not intended for the public, yet was a
beautiful evidence of angel guardianship. She stat-
ed the story minutely, saying that was where and
when she got Mrs. Wood's name, for she was pres-
ent with others she named.
The doctor's daughter Emma Angelia, who had
been in spirit-life since March 10, 1849, sought
through Mary to take the body she was controlling
and go home with her father to Wisconsin, to visit
the family for a week, and Mary was disposed to let
her do it; she asked Mr. and Mrs Roff if she should
let Emma Stevens have the body for a week to go
with her father to see and be with her mother,
sisters and brother, so they could realize it was
Emma? But no one thought it advisable.
To show the ease with which Mary controls, or
goes in and out, as it is said, and the perfect me-

Roff, their hired woman Charlotte, Dr. Steel and

Mrs. M , and the writer, manifestations of a very
peculiar and happy character occurred. Mary be-

took the only vacant seat, next to a gentleman
friend. Dr. Steel became influenced by a brother
of one of the persons present, and made a very strik-
ing address, with a good deal of energy and pathos.
On his becoming disentranced and entering into the
general conversation, Mary voluntarily disembodied
her controlling pow^er, and leaving the girl's form

Dr. Steel, and in every possible way required prov-

limp condition, with a pleasant jest at the friend
who supported it. She soon, how^ever, returned to
her ow^n proper control and seemed to enjoy the trick
she had played, in the control of the gentleman.
In a few^ moments she appeared peculiar, and call-
ing the hired woman to follow her, they left the
room. Soon she returned clad in an old-fashioned
way, with gown, cap, cape and spectacles, etc., lean-
ing on the arm of Charlotte as if bowed down with
many years. Not one trace of the girl could be seen
save in the youthful skin of the face. Taking a seat
in the old arm chair, she began to talk as an old
lady of olden times might be supposed to do, rep-
resenting herself as the grand-mother of Charlotte,
giving her name, inquiring after all the relatives, old
and young, asking by name for those belonging to
families the girl could have know^n nothing about.
Said she died of cancer near the right eye and tem-

being furnished, proceeded in the most natural man-

food and ate it, apparently without teeth, smoked
after it, as she used to do, because her food always
hurt her if she did not. She asked for knitting
work. It being furnished, she found fault because
the knitter did not know how to knit. Raveling out
and taking up again she knit, at the same time
telling Charlotte how to knit without looking at it.
She next asked for mending and other things to do,

how w^hen she found an opportunity.
During her stay at Mr. RofF's her physical con-
dition continually improved, being under the care
and treatment of her supposed parents and the ad-
vice and help of her physician. She w^as ever obe-
dient to the government and rules of the family, like
a careful and wise child, always keeping in the com-
pany of some of the family, unless to go in to the
nearest neighbors across the street. She was often
invited and went with Mrs. Roff to visit the first fam-
ilies of the city, who soon became satisfied that the
girl w^as not crazy, but a fine, w^ell-mannered child.
The manner in w^hich she acted for a considerable
time after coming into Mr. Roff's family was very
strange to many. Sitting dow^n to the tea-table on
one occasion, Mrs. Roff said
:
"Now, Mary, what shall I help you to?"
She answered:
**Oh, nothing, I thank you, ma. Fll go to heaven
for my tea."
*
Suiting the action to the word off she went into
a quiet trance or to heaven as she termed it and so
remained till the family had eaten when she return-

she had been to tea and the question was put:
'*Mary, what do you eat, and how do you eat it?"
Her answer w^as:
**0 ma, if I could tell, you could not understand it."
And thus for some time she only ate in that way,
except a very little occasionally, to pacify the anx-
ious family. As her system became in better con-

THE WATSEKA WONDER 41
Lurancy for a little time, yet not enough to lose her
identity or permit the manifestation of Lurancy*s
mind, but enough to show she was impressing her
presence upon her own body.
On being asked, "Where is Lurancy?" she would
say, '*Gone out some where," or, *'She is in heaven
taking lessons, and I am here taking lessons too."
On Sunday, May nineteenth, about half-past four
o'clock p. m., Mr. Roff and Mary were sitting in the
parlor, Henry Vennum, Lurancy's brother, being in
the sitting room, another room and hall between.
Mary left control, and Lurancy took full possession
of her own body. Henry was called in and she caught
him around his neck, kissed and wept over him,
causing all present to weep. At this juncture Mr.
Roff was called and asked Lurancy if she could stay
till Henry could go and bring her mother (she had
expressed a desire to go and see her father and
mother.) She said, "No," but if Henry would go
and bring her, she would come again and talk with
her. She immediately left and Mary came again.
When Mary was asked where she had been, she re-
plied, *'l have seen Dr. Stevens and he looks as good
as ever again."
Mrs. Vennum was brought w^ithin an hour, and
on her arrival, Lurancy came into full control, when
one of the most affecting scenes ever witnessed took
place. Mother and daughter embraced and kissed
each other, and wept until all present shed tears of
sympathy ; it seemed the very gate of heaven.
On the morning of May twenty-first, Mr. Roff
w^rites as follow^s
:
Mary is to leave the body of Rancy today, about eleven o'clock,
so she says. She is bidding neighbors and friends good-by. Ran-
cy to return home all right today. Mary came from her room
upstairs where she was sleeping with Lottie, at ten o'clock last
night, lay down by us, hugged and kissed us, and cried because
she must bid us good-by, telling us to give all her pictures, mar-
bles and cards, and twenty-five cents Mrs. Vennum had given her,
to Rancy, and had us promise to visit Rancy often. She tells me

* * * She said last night, weeping, "Oh, pa, I am going to
heaven tomorrow at eleven o'clock, and Rancy is coming back
cured, and going home all right." She talked most lovingly about
the separation to take place, and most beautiful was her talk
about heaven and home.
Mrs. Alter writes:
When the day came, and the angels told Mary that Lurancy
was coming to take full possession of her body, it seemed to make
her feel very sad. She went to the residences of Mr. L. C. Marsh
and Mr. M. Hoober, to say good-by, telling them the angels had
said the body was cured, and Lurancy w^as coming to go home
and live with her parents again, all well; yet she says, "I feel sad
at parting with you all, for you have treated me so kindly; you
have helped me by your sympathy to cure this body, and Rancy
can come and inhabit it."
This shows that the angels can help the children
of earth. Mr. M, Hoober being a pious Christian
gentleman, and loving Mary for her sweet influence
in his family, came into the room and asked if she
would like to sing with him and his good wife. She
said:
"Yes, I am so sad, but when I go to heaven all
tears shall be w^iped aw^ay, and I w^ill be happy.**
After singing they all knelt down, and Mr.
Hoober made a very affecting prayer, saying, *4f it
can be that an angel is in our midst, and about to
leave us and go and join her ow^n in spirit-life, w^ill
God in his goodness allow^ her to bear a message of
love to my angel father and loved ones w^ho may,

go to Mr. Vennum's with her. Mary said: **I will
come in spirit as close to you as I can, and comfort
you in sorrow, and you will feel me near you some-
times."
When eleven o'clock came she seemed loth to go
or let Rancy go back. Mrs. Altar stai^ted to go
home and Mary started with her. When in the yard,
Mrs. A. said: "Mary, you have always done as you
said you would, but as I don't understand these
things, w^ill you please let Lurancy come back just
now, and then you can come again if you want to?"
Mary said: '*Yes, I will," and she kissed mother and
sister good-by.
A voice said, *'Why, Mrs. Alter, where are we go-
ing?" Then in a breath, "Oh, yes, I know, Mary
told me!"
On the way they met Mrs. Marsh and Mrs. Hoober,
who were the nearest neighbors and Mary's favorite
friends; Lurancy did not seem to know them, but re-
marked, **Mary thinks so much of these neighbors."
Then turning to Mrs. Alter, with whom Lurancy had
been but slightly acquainted two years ago, she said,
^*Mrs Alter, Mary can come and talk to you nearly
all the way home, if you want her to, and then I will
come back." She spoke, and appeared like one
slightly acquainted. Mrs. Alter said: "I have trusted
you in the past, and of course I would love to talk
with my sister."
The change was again made, and Mary said, **I
do love to be w^ith you so much."
She talked lovingly, and gave good advice about
many things and family matters. The final change
now^ took place at the time predicted, and Lurancy
stated she felt something as though she had been
asleep, yet she knew she had not. On reaching Mr.
Roff's office, she addressed him as Mr. Roff, and
asked if he would take her home, which he did.

May twenty-second, Mr. Roff writes me as follows:
44 THE WATSEKA WONDER
Thank God and the good angels, the dead is alive and the lost
is found. I mailed you a letter yesterday at half-past ten o'clock
A. M., stating that Mery told us she would go away, and Rancy
return at eleven o'clock the twenty-first of May. Now I write
you that at half-past eleven o'clock A. M., Minerva called at my
office with Rancy Vennum, and wanted me to take her home,
which I did. She called me Mr. Roff, and talked with me as a
young girl would, not being acquainted. 1 asked her how things
appeared to her—if they seemed natural. She said it seemed like
a dream to her. She met her parents and brother in a very af-
fectionate manner, hugging and kissing each one in tears of glad-
ness. She clasped her arms around her father's neck a long time,
fairly smothering him w^ith kisses. I saw^ her father just now
(eleven o'clock). He says she has been perfectly natural, and
seems entirely well. You see my faith in w^riting you yesterday
morning instead of w^aiting till she came.
The Watseka "Republican" says:
The meeting with her parents at the home was very affecting,
and now^ she seems to be a healthy, happy little girl, going about
noting things she saw before she was stricken, and recognizes
changes that have since taken place. This is a remarkable case,
and the fact that we cannot understand such things, does not do
away with the existence of these unaccountable manifestations.
The Danville (111.) "Times," in speaking of this case,
says:
Mr. and Mrs. Roff are Spiritualists, and stoutly maintain that
their daughter's ability to penetrate closed books and letters in
the manner indicated, was imparted by the inhabitants of the un-
seen world. We have no fixed opinion as to w^hether Spiritualism
is false or true. Certain it is, that occurrences are upon record
which are hard to explain upon any natural hypothesis, but at-
tributable to spirits' aid. Let those say w^ho know, for we do not.
In spite of all opposition, Spiritualists have increased in numbers,
nor are they confined to the illiterate classes, but embrace poets,
scholars and statesmen. Let us hope the unharmful truth will

Thank God and the good angels, the dead is alive and the lost
is found. I mailed you a letter yesterday at half-past ten o'clock
A. M., stating that Mery told us she would go away, and Rancy
return at eleven o'clock the twenty-first of May. Now l write
you that at half-past eleven o'clock A. M., Minerva called at my
office with Rancy Vennum, and wanted me to take her home,
which l did. She called me Mr. Roff, and talked with me as a
young girl would, not being acquainted. l asked her how things
appeared to her-if they seemed natural. She said it seemed like
a dream to her. She met her parents and brother in a very af-
fectionate manner, hugging and kissing each one in tears of glad-
ness. She clasped her arms around her father's neck a long time,
fairly smothering him with kisses. l saw her father just now
(eleven o'clock). He says she has been perfectly natural, and
seems entirely well. You see my faith in writing you yesterday
morning instead of waiting till she came.
The Watseka "Republican" says:
. The meeting with her parents at the home was very affecting,
and now she seems to be a healthy, happy little girl, going about
noting things she saw before she was stricken, and recognizes
changes that have since taken place. This is a remarkable case,
and the fact that we cannot understand such things, does not do
away with the existence of these unaccountable manifestations.
The Danville (Ill.) "Times/' in speaking of this case,
says:
Mr. and Mrs. Roff are Spiritualists, and stoutly maintain that
their daughter's ability to penetrate closed books and letters in
the manner indicated, was imparted by the inhabitants of the un-
seen world. We have no fixed opinion as to whether Spiritualism
is false or true. Certain it is, that occurrences are upon record
which are hard to explain upon any natural hypothesis, but at-
tributable to spirits' aid. Let those say who know, for we do not.
ln spite of all opposition, Spiritualists have increased in numbers,
nor are they confined to the illiterate classes, but embrace poets,
scholars and statesmen. Let us hope the unharmful truth will
early assert a glorious reign, and illuminate the darkened under-
standing of men.
The Iriquois County (lll.) "Times/"under the head
of "Mesmeric Mysteries," and in reference to Luran-
cy Vennum says:
Mr. and Mrs. Roff kindly offered to take charge of her until
her mind would change, and she would become well again. She
went there in February, and remained till about three weeks ago.
Since then she has been Lurancy Vennum, and is healthy and full
of intelligence.

was not prompted by the spirit of Mary Roff, how could she know

quainted, and whom she had never visited? * * No stranger
would have suspected her of being the victim of disease, though
her eyes were unusually bright. * * There are yet numberles*
mysteries in this world, though science has dissipated many won-
ders, and philosophy has made plain many marvels. There is

and they do many things that puzzle the greatest philosophers.
Skeptical and unbelieving as we are, and slight as our experience
has been, we have seen enough to convince us that Spiritualism
is not all humbug. The case of Lurancy Vennum, a bright young
girl of fourteen years, has been the subject of much discussion
in Watseka during the past year, and there is a good deal in it
beyond human comprehension.
The subject of this article has become familiar with
the writer during the several months she was under his
advice and the more kindly care and sympathy of Mr.
Roff's family, speaking with him freely upon every sub-
ject necessary to her good and the courtesies of associ-
ation, always, however, in the presence of members of
the family. On Sunday, the second day of June, he met
her with her parents at the house of a friend, who lived
nearly two miles from Mr. Vennum's. Lurancy was in-
troduced to him by Mr. Vennum. She seemed to be an
entire stranger, and for two hours remained like a timid,
unacquainted child. The next day, June the third, with-
out notice to any one, the writer went to the house of a
noted attorney, and as he enered the gate, Liwancy came
out the door, stopped on the steps and said, **Howdoyou
do, Doctor? Mary Roff told me to come here and meet
you. Somehow she makes me feel you have been a very
kind friend to me;" and she would not let him into the
house until she had delivered a long message from Mary.
Since the last interview he heis seen her several times, and
she seems easy, siffable, and as a young lady should.
On the twenty-fifth of June she wrote a beautiful letter,
by the consent of her friends, saying among other things
:
Dear Doctor:—I am feeling quite well today. I was up to
Mrs. Alter's today; she is very well at present. This afternoon
I called at Mr. Roff's office, and had quite a long talk with him;
but of course it was about thei loving angels that you and I love

Since penning the foregoing, the writer has received
the following letter from the mother of Lurancy, through
the politeness of Mr. Roff:
Watseka, 111., July 9, 1878.
Dear Friend:—Mary L. Vennum is perfectly and entirely well,
and perfectly natural. For two or three weeks after her return
home, she seemed a little strange to what she had been before
she was taken sick last summer, but only, perhaps, the natural
change that had taken place within the girl, and except it seemed
to her as though she had been dreaming or sleeping, etc. Luran-
cy has been smarter, more intelligent, more industrious, more
womanly and more polite than before. We give the credit of her
complete cure and restoration to her family, to Dr. E. W. Stevens
and Mr. and Mrs. Roff, by their obtaining her removal to Mr
Roff's where her cure w^as perfected. We firmly believe that had
she remained at home, she w^ould have died, or we would have
been obliged to send her to the insane asylum, and if so, that she
would have died there and further, that I could not have lived
but a short time with the care and trouble devolving on me.
Several of the relatives of Mary Lurancy, including ourselves, now
believe she was cured by spirit power, and that Mary Roff con-
trolled the girl. MRS. LURINDA VENNUM.
On the tenth of July Mr. Roff writes:
Dear Doctor:—Mr. Vennum is out of town, but I have often
talked with him, and I know his opinion, often expressed, that
Lurancy and her mother would both have died if we had not
taken the girl; he gives all credit to yourself and us for it. He

I furnished Dr. Stevens with all the material facts
in the case, except such as w^ere w^ithin his ow^n
knowledge. The history of the Vennum family (and
Lurancy*s condition up to the time he and 1 went to
see her January 31st), I obtained from the members
thereof, and the neighbors intimately acquainted
w^ith them. The narrative, as written by Dr. Stevens,
is substantially true in every point and particular,
yet the half has not been told, and never can be; it
is impossible for pen to describe or language portray
the wonderful events that transpired during the
memorable fourteen weeks that the girl was at our
house. The material facts of the case can be sub-
stantiated by disinterested w^itnesses, whose veracity
cannot be questioned, and w^hose evidence w^ould set-
tle in a court of law. I refer you to Robert Doyle,
Charles Sherman, S. R. Hawks, Lile Marsh, J. M.
Hoober, and their wives, and to Mrs. Mary Wagoner,
formerly Mary Lord, all residents of Watseka. As
to "collusion," ^^arrangement," or **ourselves being
deceived," that is simply impossible, as you will see
if you carefully read the whole narrative over again.
I, too, doubt whether newspapers are always ''em-
bodiments of sacred truths," but in this case I assure
the writer, the '^Journal" does embody a very sacred
truth, that of man's immortality. * * '•'
Talking with Mary, we sometimes spoke of her
(death. She would quickly reply: "I never died," or
\**I did not die." She never tired of talking of the
life beyond this. She would at any time leave her

with her '*pa" or "ma" about heaven and the angels.

HONORABLE MENTION OF ASA B. ROFF
The naone of this gentleman has lately become of much
interest to our readers in connection with the case of Lu-
fancy Vennum. From a somewhat lengthy biographical
sketch of Mr. Roff, published last January in the "Iro-
quois County Times," a paper printed at Watseka, we
make the following extracts:
* * * A gentleman now in his sixtieth year, though with a
heart as young and happy as that of a child; agreeable, generous
and full of sympathy, he is respected by all who know him, while
his more intimate friends love and honor him for his personal
worth. * * * His present enviable standing among his fellow-
men is entirely owing to his indomitable energy and integrity of
purpose. His family is a most exemplary one; all who know them
love them; no family in our community are more happy in their
domestic relations. May it ever be so with them.
The above extracts in connection with the following
letters, would seem to establish Mr. Roff^s reputation for
truth amd veracity beyond aJl question:
Watseka, 111., Aug. 22, 1878.
Editor "Religio-Philosophical JournaJ:**
Dear Sir:—Many inquiries are made of me as to the
standing of Mr. Asa B. Roff. These questions are elicited
through the publication in your Journal of Dr. E. W.
Stevens's account of Mary Roff and Lurancy Vennum
phenomena. I wish to say to you that no man in this
community stands higher in the estimation of the people
than Mr. Roff. He is a high-minded, honorable gentle-
man who would spurn to give currency to any thing not
verified by facts. I don't believe Mr. Roff capable of
a mean act. It is not in his nature. Very truly yours,
MATTHEW H. PETERS.
Mayor of Watseka, and Editor ^'Iroquois Times."

HONORABLE MENTION OF ASA B. ROFF
The name of this gentleman has lately become of much
interest to our readers in connection with the case of Lu-
rancy Vennum From a somewhat lengthy biographical
sketch of Mr. Roff, published last January in the "Iro-
quois County Times," a paper printed at Watseka, we
make the following extracts:
* * *
A gentleman now in his sixtieth year, though with a
heart as young and happy as that of a child; agreeable, generous
and full of sympathy, he is respected by all who know him, while
his more intimate friends love and honor him for his personal
worth. * * *
His present enviable standing among his fellow-
men is entirely owing to his indomitable energy and integrity of
purpose. His family is a most exemplary one; all who know them
love them; no family in our community are more happy in their
domestic relations. May it ever be so with them.
The above extracts in connection with the following
letters, would seem to establish Mr. Roff's reputation for
truth and veracity beyond all question:
Watseka, Ill., Aug. 22, 1878.
Editor "Religio-Philosophical Journal :"
Dear Sir :-Many inquiries are made of me as to the
standing of Mr. Asa B. Roff. These questions are elicited
through the publication in your Journal of Dr. E. W.
Stevens's account of Mary Rolf and Lurancy Vennum
phenomena. I wish to say to you that no man in this
community stands higher in the estimation of the people
than Mr. Roff. He is a high-minded, honorable gentle-
man who would spurn to give currency to any thing not
verified by facts. I don't believe Mr. Roff capable of
a mean act. It is not in his nature. Very truly yours,
MATTHEW I-I. PETERS.
Mayor of Watseka, and Editor "Iroquois Times."

Editorial Note! —Believing that those who read
the account of Lurancy Vennum's case as published
eight years ago, as well as thousands who will now
read it for the first time, would be interested in tra-

succeeding years, the publisher addressed a letter
of inquiry to Mr. A. B. Roff. That gentleman hav-
ing secured such information as he could from her
parents and others, adds it to his own and brings
the history of Lurancy Vennum dow^n to date. His
statement as given below can be fully substantiated
and is entitled to confidence.

"On July 16, 1878, you and others certified to Lurancy Ven-

statement of her history from then until now? Has she had any
return of symptoms? Is she a medium now, or has she been since
1878, at any time? What is the state of her health, and what
has it been since 1878? Has she any remembrance of her old
experience while controlled by the spirits?"

turned home from our house until January 1, 1882, when «ho
'was married to George Binning, a farmer living three miles from
Watseka, where they resided until they moved West in September,
1884, and they are now living in Rollins County, Kansas.
We met her often before we went West in June, 1879, and
every year thereafter until they moved West in 1 884, whenever
opportunity afforded during our annual visits to Watseka; and
then Mary would take control of Lurancy just as she did during
the time she was at our home in 1878; we thus enjoyed many
happy seasons together. Aside from this she had little oppor^
tunity of using her mediumship, her parents being afraid to con-
verse with her upon the subject lest it should cause a return of
the "spells" (as they called them), such as she had before Mary
brought her to our house. Her husband, never having made him-
self acquainted with Spiritualism, furnished poor conditions for
farther development in that direction; this, with the fact that her
many household cares and busy life, together with the charge of
her children, has made the exercise of her mediumship extremely
dfBcult, except when she was thrown in the society of our family
or others who chanced to furnish the necessary conditions.
Lurancy has what might be called, perhaps, a "remembrance"
of her old experience while controlled by the spirit. She always
speaks of it thus: "Mary told me," or "Mary made me acquaint-
ed," etc. She became acquainted with several persons while Mary
controlled her, who were entire strangers to Lurancy Vennum.
When the control left her, she continued the acquaintance thus
formed, and has ever had a warm attachment for them. Mary,
she says, told her these were good people, etc. She has never
had any occasion for a physician since she left us—never having
been sick since then; neither has there been a return of the old
symptoms—no pain, no fits—in short, "she is clothed and in her
right mind." That the spirit-world has charge concerning her,
let the following forever settle, which can be fully substantiated by
reliable witnesses: At the birth of her first child she was entranc-
ed, her eyes were turned heavenward, a beautiful smile played
over her face, the work of deliverance w^ent on painlessly, and
not until the new^ soul voiced its presence, did she show any sign
of consciousness of w^hat had occurred. She then said: "Why,
what is that?" When she was informed it was her baby, she said:
"Is that so?" And was overjoyed to think that the Father God
should send an angel to stand betw^een her and that agony
which every mother-soul so well understands.
I deem it a duty since Dr. E. W. Stevens has passed to the
higher life, to relate an occurrence that would have been published
in the "Watseka Wonder" at first, had it not been for Doctor's
unwillingless to have anything in that publication rest wholly up-
on his individual testimony for proof. When Lurancy had been
at our house under Mary's control about six or eight weeks she

turned home from our house-until January 1, 1882, when she

tald to Dr. Stevens in our presence:
"You are going to get a letter from heaven."
He asked, "When?"
"I don't know; but you will get one," she replied.
Two or three weeks later Dr. Stevens again came to our house
and then related to Lurancy (Mary) and us that he had received
the letter at some place where he stayed over night. He saw in
the morning while making his toilet a letter, seemingly hanging
in the air, yet in plain writing, and signed by a noted French
physician (whose name we have forgotten), who died many years
ago. The letter contained directions for treating a physical ail-
ment of Lurancy, which Dr. S., had lost sight of. It was with
difficulty that the family and the Doctor got the consent of the
controlling spirit to have the body magnetized; however, the treat-
ment was given, Dr. S., being under control of Peonomo, his
Indian healer, and while he treated, Peonomo talked in his native
language, and Mary interpreted for her parents. The conver-
sation was about the diseased organs of which Lurancy was wholly
ignorant. The letter referred to ordered five treatments, but
three proved sufficient to reinstate natural action, and to make
better conditions for the controlling spirit to finish the cure. Lu-
rancy has had the strongest regard and affection for the family
of Dr. Stevens and our family, and all of Mary Roff's friends ever
since Mary relinquished her control, and Lurancy became herself
again. The father and mother of Lurancy remain firm in the
belief that it was spirit power that saved and cured their daughter.

revelation meant to me, I can not express. With it
came a new incentive, and a glorious sunshine that
has ever lingered to brighten and harmonize all that
is dear to me. This visitation was as real as if in
some foreign land I had come face to face with the
living, breathing sister of my earlier life—the kiss,
the embrace, and the girlish laugh as palpable as
when in the physical form.
I am now^ sixty-four years of age. I could have
no purpose to deceive myself, or to mislead others.
My life, w^hile uneventful, has been a happy one.
My confidence in the fulfillment of all hopes as to the
future life, has grown year by year, with my age.
And as the sunset approaches, I harbor no fear of the
coming night: its shadow^s contain w^ithin their
folds no demand to torment w^ith horror the closing
hour. I have come to know^ something tangible of

ised to abandon^ but she did abandon, in a great
measure, her pernicious interference. On this oc-
casion she said, as I remember, "Mrs. Roff, I am not
as bad as you think me to be . On earth I was pos-
sessed of a strong magnetic body. I loved to employ
it to my purpose. I had a hand that could crush
you with its strength; and it is through the exercise
of this magnetic power that life has been sustained
in the w^eakened body of Lurancy Vennum."
Such a part of the drama of every-day life you,
my reader, might not care to take. You w^ould pre-
fer that your lines be woven into the fabric of finer
character. Yet we each play a part commensurate
to our development, and in touch with our sympa-
thies. When the great poet wrote, *'The world's
a stage, and all the people players," he might well
have added that when in this life the play is ended
and the curtain-lights are extinguished, the perfor-
mance is still continued : the invisible character
coming and going, each repeating their lines, and
the music of the orchestra, unheard by mortal ears,
still floating in the vast Ampitheatre of Nature;
and that yet further on, under the blows of a
noiseless hammer, there are grow^ing into life the
stage-settings for another act; amid the rehearsals
and repetitions each actor working out a role that
is his alone.
It was at the final solicitation of the parents of
Lurancy Vennum, that she became a temporary in-
mate of my mother's home; it w^as so desired by
Mr. and Mrs. Vennum with the hope that they might
avoid committing Lurancy to an insane asylum
Lurancy was received with a far greater joy than
w^ould have characterized the homecoming of a
daughter in this life. We realized that we were
welcoming in the physical form a daughter and
sister w^ho had been dead tw^elve long years.

sister who had been dead twelve long years.
I remember that after the warm greeting was
THE WATSEKA WONDER 57
over, Lurancy approached the piano, and said : "Oh,
Ma! The same old piano—and the same old
cover!" Then opening the case of the instrument,
she attempted to play and sing as of yore. The
songs were the ones of her youth; as we stood
listening, the familiar notes were hers, although
emanating from another's lips. The effect, how-
ever, w^as only partially successful. Turning w^ith a
smile to the family present, she remarked, "I can not
make my fingers w^ork just right."
Frequently my sister Mary would give us instruc-
tions as to w^hat w^e should do to insure the return
of health to the body of Lurancy Vennum in which
she was then living. When these instructions were
carried out, the results w^ere alw^ays beneficial. At
times she w^as permitted to visit other homes, and to
associate w^ith other girls. It was then that the
conditions seemed to open the way for the intrusion
of Katrina Hogan, and others; and after such
absences, not until the harmonious influences of
her old home were reached, would she emerge the
same sw^eet sister Mary—clearly demonstrating that
favorable conditions w^ere necessary to her undis-
turbed tenancy of Lurancy*s body. Here auto-sug-
gestion may have been concerned; for if we retain
memory in the life beyond, w^hich w^e must do to

arrange in all its detail the drama as it was being
enacted? Impossible!

58 THE WATSEKA WONDER
no flesh-and-blood walls can confine when higher
heavenly intelligence have some great purpose to
accomplish.
During the three months that my sister Mary
lived in the body of Lurancy, I was brought to feel
that whatever solution we might choose to adopt,
the unknown laws utilized were in accord with
those governing my ow^n existence. No strained re-
lations existed between the unseen—spiritually
—
sister and myself. It did not seem strange to me
that the crossing and re-crossing of the innumerable
wires that kept us in touch with the other life, and
w^hich enable those of that other life, to sense this
life, should transmit some things peculiar to their
source. I can not but believe that my loved ones
belong to me always, whether they are living in a
physical plane or a spiritual body.
During Mary*s visit, she and I spent many happy
hours in going over the events of our girlhood days,
many scenes of which I had forgotten until they
were recalled by Mary. I remember that during
one of these long talks, we were seated by the kitch-
en window overlooking a stretch of the garden in
which my sister had played years before, and which
surrounded the house in which she died. Suddenly
Mary exclaimed: '*Oh, Nervie! Do you remember
the time when Cousin Allie Roff and I found an old
hen with sore eyes under that currant bush—how
we bathed her eyes in ointment, and did all w^e
could to cure her?" I had forgotten this prank,
and many others that Mary likewise called to mind
for me.
Upon a certain occasion when Mary was being
interviewed by Mrs. Sherman, to whom reference
has been made by Dr. Stevens, she was questioned
as one would question a traveler from a strange
country, and requested to give an account of the
personages she had met in the Summerland. Mary

hours in going over the events of our girlhood days,
many scenes of which I had forgotten until they
were recalled by Mary. I remember that during
one of these long talks, we were seated by the kitch-
en window overlooking a stretch of the garden in
which my sister had played years before, and which
surrounded the house in which she died. Suddenly
Mary exclaimed: "Oh, Nervie! Do you remember
the time when Cousin Allie Roff and I found an old
hen with sore eyes under that currant bush-how
we bathed her eyes in ointment, and did all we
could to cure her?" I had forgotten this prank,
and many others that Mary likewise called to mind
for me.
Upon a certain occasion when Mary was being
interviewed by Mrs. Sherman, to whom reference
has been made by Dr. Stevens, she was questioned
as one would question a traveler from a strange
country, and requested to give an account of the
personages she had met in the Summerland. Mary
THE WATSEKA WONDER 59
gave to Mrs. Sherman the exact names of those who
had composed her family, then long since dead,
and also the names of many of Mrs. Sherman's
neighbors and acquaintances who had passed out;
mentioning in .particular the family of Rev. Mr
Rhea, and stating the name of a child in spirit form
unknown to Mrs. Sherman. From her intimate
knowledge of the Rhea family, Mrs Sherman in-
sisted that Mary was mistaken in this instance; but
Mary stoutly maintained that the child named was
resident in the life beyond, and later investigation
proved this to be correct. The name given w^as
one being considered w^hen the babe at childbirth,
or shortly afterwards, passed out.
If such occurrences as the foregoing do not possess
positively the value of clear and direct communi-
cation w^ith the spirit w^orld, some other solution
not involving auto-suggestion must be evolved. If
the hypothesis of a subconscious, subliminal self
be adopted, how much of a distinct personality
may we claim to represent? And how do those who
object to the spiritual hypothesis know^ to w^hat
extent their objections are due to this same auto-
suggestion?
Is the brain the plaything of external forces that
make or dismantle that which we each so proudly
claim as especially our ow^n—distinct personality?
If auto-suggestion accounts for the phenomena
in the case of my sister, then must it account for
much or all the phenomena we daily experience. Is
the scientist less under the influence of this subtle
agent, than the brain untutored? Are we depen-
dent upon the character of our own mentality, or
are our brains, as it w^ere, but sensitized plates re-
ceiving and recording fleeting thought-pictures as
they pass unbidden before us? These explanations
are to me cumbersome and strained when compar-
ed with the distinct reality of spirit return, which

As the time appointed grew nearer and nearer
for the departure of my sister Mary, I w^as filled
w^ith anxiety as to when and how^ the conscious
spirit of Lurancy Vennum would return and claim
her own body. Unusual indeed in this life is the
spectacle of two personalities alternately inhabit-
ing and dominating one tenancy. My doubts and
fears as to the outcome w^ere intensified by the
public criticism, naturally enough engendered; and
this kept me in close scrutiny of all that w^as about
to take place.
On a certain morning, my Mother and I w^ere
seated in Mother's bed-room, with Lurancy between
us. We determined to test the possibility of the
contemplated change; and we asked Mary if she
could comprehend the purpose of her control of
Lurancy's body, and w^hen and how the personal-
ities could be effected. "Mary,** I said, you tell us
that *Lurancy is just on the outside*; can you dem-
onstrate the change of characters?'* *'l understand
why I am here, of course," she replied; "I will ask
and see if Lurancy can come back." And in an
instant, Lurancy—timid and shrinking, again in the
physical, and in a strange home—w^as before us.
The change in personality was complete in every
way, and the situation was painfully embarrassing.
Lurancy—the real Lurancy—again in her own body,
demanded to know^ w^here she w^as. She recognized
me, however; I had trained her with other girls in
various church and social functions. But I had to in-
troduce her to my mother. Lurancy asked to be tak-
en home, and inquired most eagerly after her mother
and the immediate family. We—Mother and I
—
explained that she had been ill and that she wai
with us for the purpose of being cured. Then in a

moment the personality was reversed and my sister
Mary was speaking from Lurancy*s body. Grasping
me about the neck, she implored—*'Nervie, do you
longer doubt that it is I?" It was then that Mary
informed us that within a week—naming the day
—
she w^ould depart to her home in heaven.
Dr. Stevens has faithfully portrayed many events
occurring in this wonderful history; and I might and
would add many more that did not come under his
notice, did I not feel that so to do could not further
strengthen the evidence of an angePs visitation to
my Father's home.
On the morning of the day that was named, I
went, as instructed by Mary, to my parents* home
for a final leave-taking; and from thence it was
arranged that I should accompany Mary to my
Father's office, and that Father should escort her
home.
The sadness of a farewell is too well known to all
mothers and sisters. Leaving the home arm-in-arm,
Mary and I started on what was to me a most mar-
velous journey. Then did I fully realize the wonder
of it; I knew that but few mortals could understand
I w^as w^alking dow^n the road in close companion-
ship w^ith a conscious intelligence that had dwelt in
another world for twelve years. But it was very
real to me.
After we had passed the home of Mrs. Marsh,
where good-byes were said, and when I was oppress-
ed by fears of something I could not define, I said to
Mary, **Where is Lurancy now?" "Just on the out-
side, Nervie," she answered, as she had answered
before; and like a flash there was another change,
and Lurancy Vennum had returned. Startled and
confused, in my efforts to pacify, I assured her we
were on our w^ay to her home ; and then I prayed
with all my might that Mary might be permitted to
again come, and remain until w^e reached home. And

alteration: Lurancy was gone, and Mary w^as back
at my side.

passed to reach my Father's office, for the last time;
and after we had rested for a few moments, and
crowded into that brief space all the love and en-
dearments we had so sorely missed from each other
in a separation of years, the final kiss was given and
returned—and in a moment Mary had left us for the
last time.
Lurancy Vennum has grown to be a healthy, mid-
dleaged woman. She is the mother of eleven chil-
dren, and is respected as a neighbor and honored as
a friend. Of the part she played in a great drama
staged by heaven and earth, and of what she experi-
enced, she has but dim remembrance; but her at-
tachment to her former friends has not lessened with
the passing years.
