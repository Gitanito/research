FOREWORD
In presenting this, the second of a series of brochures on the
"I AM," it is with the earnest hope that it may prove of real
help to all those students who have been disheartened or dis
illusioned by the revealing disclosures made in the first bro
chure regarding the Ballard teachings.
Also it is hoped that it may prove helpful to students of other
teachings. It is not just an analysis, but it represents an earnest
attempt at a synthesis of related teachings and philosophies,
showing the golden thread of unity and truth that runs through
all of them.
The golden thread that unites them all is the Christ Con
sciousness, by means of which all the great Teachers of the
world have attained. All teachings and philosophies lead to
this Christ; and through the labyrinth and maze of ideas and
teachings of various schools, and the endless number of contra
dictions, there is no peace for the Truth Seeker until he is able
to reach up, as it were, to this unifying factor—the Great Syn
thesizer of human life.
Therefore, even though this brochure deals with a penetrative
analysis of the Ballard teachings and reveals many contradic
tions and inaccuracies as did the first brochure, nevertheless, it
represents also an earnest attempt at a synthesis of conflicting
elements of thought. It should not leave the student disconso
late and hopeless because another teaching has been found
wanting. The lesson is, we are to worship no idols, no person
alities, no teachings, but are to go direct to the only true source
of Truth, to the God Within, the Christ Consciousness. All
others will fail you—only the Christ Within can save you.

THE SOURCE OF THE BALLARD TEACHINGS
Mr. and Mrs. Ballard emphatically claim that the source of
their teachings is direct from the "Great Ascended Masters,"
particularly "Saint Germain" and "Jesus" ; but also the "Great
Divine Director," the "Tall Master from Venus," and literally
a score of others. They give credit to no human source.
We could if we had space enough list a number of sources
right here on this earth plane where they undoubtedly have ob
tained much of their material, although they make absolutely
no acknowledgment of it. They have taken the usual run of met
aphysical literature dealing with the power of spirit or mind
over matter, and have grafted on it certain occult teachings
treating of the "Planes of Nature," the "Occult Hierarchies,"
etc. In brief, they have taken what usually passes for "Unity"
or "New Thought," and have erected upon it a super-structure
dealing with Theosophical or Rosicrucian conceptions, such
as: Man's Higher Bodies, the Invisible Planes of Nature, Re-
embodiment or Reincarnation, the Masters of Wisdom or the
Elder Brothers of Humanity, the Law of Karma, etc. —material
that has been in existence for scores of years.
Consequently there is in their literature much that is familiar,
some that is reasonably true, and much that is only too readily
accepted by those who have but a meager knowledge of these
different philosophies. But when one tries to build a house
out of various kinds of stones that were not intended or designed
for
it,
then one can but expect
a
resultant structure that
is
ir
regular in outline and which no amount of juggling can build
into
a
true architectural conception. This house will not with
stand honest criticism, for
it
has been erected in defiance of ar
chitectural laws and principles.

THE "I AM" NOT A NEW TEACHING
It would appear from the statements of Mr. and Mrs. Ballard
that they are giving out something quite new and different re
garding the "I AM." Jesus the Christ allegedly speaks through
them and says:
"This work of Saint Germain and Myself is
entirely different from anything that has been
given forth to the Western World . . . ." (Page
351, "I AM Discourses.")*
They quote the one whom they call "Saint Germain, the
Ascended Master," as saying:
"Under this beloved brother and sister, the Mes
sengers, the Great Cosmic Law has permitted
the Secret of the Ages to be broadcast .... the
privilege that stands at your door is unparalleled
in the history of the earth." (March "Voice of
the I AM," Page 26.)
Now there is positively no "secret" regarding the teaching of
the "I AM." The words, "I AM," are not new, and every meta
physical student long before the advent of the Ballards knew
what these words meant. It was known and taught that when
a person said "I AM" with a conscious realization of what
these words meant, that he gave voice to an individualized ex
pression of the God Within.
Also a study of comparative religion reveals the fact that
people of all lands down through the remotest periods of his-
*The dates, quotations and page numbers are taken from the first editions of
the Ballard books. Later edition may or may not have page numbers correspond,
ing with these quotations.
The italicized and bold-face type in the quotations are our own, as also the use
of small capitals in the presentment of contrasting passages.

tory have had some conscious realization of the "I AM," the
One Eternal, Deathless Spirit that "survives the wrecks of mat
ter and the crush of worlds."
The God Within has been, and is, a living thing to millions
of people. It is none other than the "Mighty I AM Pres
ence" the Ballards tell about, although they add much to this
conception which is questionable.
Up to the appearance of the Ballards, the various "I AM"
groups did not generally visualize or see the "Presence" over
their heads —where Mr. and Mrs. Ballard say it is. They
record "Saint Germain" as saying:
"The presence of the "Mighty I AM" abides with
in the Electronic Body of every individual, rest
ing from twelve to fifty feet or more above the
physical body . . . ." (Page 33, "Magic Pres
ence.")
This is the thing that is new and different. However, even
this is really not a new conception, nor does it belong exclusive
ly to the Ballards. Years ago, at a certain class in Los Angeles
this idea of the "Overhead Presence" was sketched on the
blackboard, and Mr. Ballard was attending that class. The idea
did not come originally to Mr. Ballard from "Saint Germain,"
for at the time of this Los Angeles class Mr. Ballard had not
met with his alleged "Mount Shasta Experiences." There are
human sources for this conception, which Mr. Ballard made use
of, although he does not credit. However, on the back of the
Ballard "Chart of the Presence" there is some limited acknowl
edgment of a human source, perhaps because of a copyright.
These words are printed thereon: "Inspiration from Arthur
Brooks' Painting —DeCamara —1935."
Whatever the real origin of this overhead "Electronic Body,"
it is certainly true that there are a lot of people who prefer to

think about the "I AM" as the quiet still voice of God dwelling
within their own beings, instead of gazing skyward at some
Spirit-Being twelve or fifty feet over their heads. We are un
equivocally warned by Jesus the Christ NOT to look for a God
outside of ourselves:
"The kingdom of God cometh not with observa
tion; neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There!
for lo, the kingdom of God is within you."
(Luke 17:20.)
The "New Thought," "Unity," "Christian Science," and
other organizations have for many years taught in a beauti
ful way of this God Presence within. We find it referred to in
considerable detail in all of the occult philosophies, such as
Theosophy, Rosicrucianism, Anthroposophy, Vedanta, etc. It
is variously known as the Ego, Soul, Spirit, Higher Self, the
"Christ Within," the "Individualized Expression of God."
In the third chapter of Exodus (3:13-14), Moses asks of
God:
"Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel
.... what shall I say to them?
And God said unto Moses: 'I AM THAT I
AM.' "
Christ taught of this same "I AM" and said to the Jews who
were doubting that He had ever seen or known their ancestor
Abraham :
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham
was, I AM." —meaning that the Ego or Spirit
was in existence before the body. (John 8:58.)
Jean Paul, famous German writer of the eighteenth century,
in his autobiography says:

"I shall never forget the event which took place
within me .... As a very small child I stood
at the door of the house one morning, looking
toward the wood pile on my left, when suddenly
the inner revelation 'I AM an I' came to me
like a flash of lightning and has remained shin
ing ever since. In that moment my ego had seen
itself for the first time and forever."
Rudolph Steiner, mystic and occultist, in a lecture delivered
the early part of this century said:
"In the whole of human speech there is one small
word which differs in toto from all the rest . . .
which you cannot apply to anything save to that
which owns
it,
and this
is
the little word 'I.'
None can address another as 'I.' This T has to
sound forth from the innermost soul itself;
it
is
the name which only the soul itself can apply to
itself.
"In the religions of earlier civilizations, among
the ancient Hebrews, for instance, this name was
known as 'the unutterable name
of
God,' and
whatever interpretation modern philology may
choose to place upon
it,
the ancient Jewish name
of God has no other meaning than that which
is
expressed in our word 'I.'
A
thrill passed
through those assembled when the 'Name of the
Unknown God' was pronounced by the Initiates,
when they dimly perceived what was meant by
those words reverberating through the temple:
'I
AM that
I
AM'."

In the face of even this very limited evidence of the uni
versality of the teaching of the "I AM," how utterly futile and
unwarranted seems the statement that the Ballards put down
as coming from Jesus:
"Saint Germain, Myself [Jesus] or any other
Ascended Masters are not giving out teachings
of the 7 AM' in the Western World, except
through Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ballard and
their son, Donald, and those named to them
and under them." (April, 1936, "Voice of the
I AM.")
DECREEING VERSUS PRAYING
When one first attends a Ballard class he is impressed, if not
startled, by their use of the decree. The atmosphere of the
auditorium is charged with power. Hands are raised on high,
and hundreds—if not thousands —of people give voice to the
same decree utterance. A mass thought-form is built up, and
the class is told that the "Great Ascended and Cosmic Masters"
are raying their powerful energy into the atmosphere and charg
ing each individual with Light as of a thousand suns. Saint
Germain is always present, so they say; Jesus the Christ is send
ing his radiation ; and the call is made to Great Beings on vari-
ious levels of cosmic attainment to assist the "I AM" students
to accomplish four chief things: to make their "Ascension" in
this life, control the "gas belts" of the earth, fill their pocket-
books, and blast the "sinister force" from the face of the earth.
That there is a power generated there is no doubt. No group
of determined people can congregate together in mass forma
tion and go through certain unified motions of the hands and

lips, and give utterance to a decree without being influenced in
some way by the psychical power generated. There are too
many evidences of the power of the mass, known variously as
"mob psychology," "mass hypnotism," the "potency of num
bers," to doubt its effect on those present. Revivalists, reform
ers, and mob leaders have all made use of it. Its effect seems
to depend upon the emotional and mental stability of those pres
ent. Knowing the power that is generated in such meetings, and
the right and wrong uses to which it might be put, it seems the
part of wisdom to exercise some thought and a little caution in
such matters.
Invocation to Deity is a sacred privilege which should only
be used for the highest and most unselfish purposes. One enters
here upon holy ground and should feel the same spirit of rev
erence as did the High Priest of old when he entered the Holy
of Holies of the Temple and invoked the awful presence of
Jehovah-God.
Mystic teachings of all peoples tell of the "Seven Spirits
Before the Throne of God." They and their Divine Messen
gers may certainly be called upon for help in an hour of need.
The Masters of Wisdom, Jesus, Buddha, and the other Great
Unselfish Ones who have this link with the God Head may
properly be asked for assistance and guidance. But the invok
ing of lesser beings — astral and etheric entities, etc.—who
are only too ready to serve (at a price), is the way of delusion,
insanity, and obsession. One should discriminate prayerfully
about these things.
Mass Praying has been used as far back as there is any his
tory of mankind. A power is built up by the group, such as
would not be possible by the individual. It no doubt had, and
still has, its purpose in the great scheme of things, but we were

told by the Great Master who came to bring us a greater Light
to enter into our closet and pray in secret. He came to bring
humanity a more abundant life through the development of the
Christ Within, which can only be brought to birth by the individ
ual himself. True individual development cannot be made on
the strength of the mass; one must in time learn to stand alone.
Mass Decreeing is an outstanding feature of the Ballard
work. It differs decidedly from the use of prayer, as we shall
endeavor to show. Webster says:
"A prayer is an earnest request or intreaty, a
petition, a supplication. A decree is an order
or decision from one having authority."
Let us note particularly that the person issuing the decree
speaks with authority. The Ballards would agree with this
definition, for they say they themselves speak with authority, as
"Authorized Messengers" of the Great White Brotherhood.
Now when a Ballard student issues a decree, on whose author
ity does he issue it? If it is on the authority of Mr. and Mrs.
Ballard, that authority necessarily breaks down if we prove that
they haven't the authority they say they have. If you have read
Brochure No. 1 of this series, you have had placed before you
certain damaging pieces of evidence showing unmistakably to
the reasoning and intuitional mind the falsity of their claims
of connection with the Great White Brotherhood, the unseen
Hierarchy of Spiritual Beings who watch over and benevo
lently influence the epochal events on earth.*
If it is on the authority of "Saint Germain" or any other of
the "Ascended Masters," is the Ballard student sure that this
•The opinions expressed in this brochure about such matters as the Masters of
Wisdom, Retreats of the Great White Brotherhood, and other unprovable subjects
are taken largely from occult sources or given as a reasonable hypothesis.

authority comes direct from these Great Beings, or is he getting
it second-hand from the Ballards?
If the decree is issued on the student's authority, then it is
well to inquire just to what degree that authority extends. What
authority has he, for instance, to decree it to rain when his
neighbor wants it to shine? He has no more authority than the
other in the matter.
What right has the Personality of a human being to order or
command the mighty God-Self to do certain things for it? Does
the little finger of your hand rule your body? Does a mere
atom assume the function of the whole being?
Oh, no, friends! This thing of ordering your Divine Self
around in the Ballard way, with emphatic gesture and com
mand: "You do this for me NOW," as though talking to a
senseless automaton —a robot—instead of to a Being of mar
velous wisdom, is not the way of true spiritual attainment and
self-mastery.
If this Divine Self has the wisdom to "beat your heart," as
Mr. Ballard says, and attend to the other vital functions, then
it has the wisdom to do the other necessary things without tak
ing orders from the Personality. One should not confuse the
servant with the Master.
Now, contrast the decree with prayer. Let us consider that
lower form of prayer that "asks" or desires something. This
is usually selfish, but you are merely asking for or desiring
something. You are not demanding or ordering. Desire
is a spiritual quality or force. In itself there is nothing wrong
in its use, although it may have a wrong application. The
point is that you merely ask; you do not pray with authority.
You send out the call, and then leave it to the judgment of the

"One in Authority" to give or not to give as your case war
rants, according to your balance account in the Great Book of
Destiny.
In prayer you are not the authoritative one; in decreeing,
you are.
Now which is the safer to use? The Ballards say that "prayer
is not sufficient to counteract forces that rock a planet." So
they say students should use the decree instead. If a decree is
so much more powerful than prayer, then we should know un
questionably on whose authority it is uttered. If there is the
least doubt about
it,
then giving voice to
a
prayer would be by
far the safer method. Besides, the higher form of prayer car
ries with
it
qualities that the decree does not have, such as hu
mility, adoration, and sublime union with Deity.
The great masterful presence of Jesus the Christ, although
able to speak with authority, nevertheless taught the multitude
how to pray. He said nothing about decreeing. And when
kneeling in the Garden of Gethsemane, deserted by all of hu
man kind, he gave utterance to
a
prayer that should always burn
itself into our minds in letters of fire
:
"Father,
if
thou be willing, remove this cup from
me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be
done." (Luke 22:42.)
That
is
the safe, Christ-like way of addressing Deity; there
is
not
a
semblance of the decree in it; only the most inexpress
ible humility.
Yes, He did come to earth to give
a
public example and rec
ord to humanity of the Way of Life (as the Ballards say He
did). We would do well to follow His example about praying,
as well as many other things.

THE DEMAND FOR MONEY
Another phase of decreeing is the DEMAND. The Ballards
teach their students to make demands on the "Universal Supply
House," and they use the power of mass thought-action to fill
their pocketbooks and bring opulence. Says "Saint Germain":
"There is positively abundant supply omnipres
ent, but the DEMAND for it must be made be
fore the Law of the Universe permits it to come
into the expression and use of the individual."
(Page 17, "Discourses.")
Emphasis is placed, throughout all the Ballard teaching,
upon decreeing and demanding things instead of working for
them. In fact, it seems that work is belittling, limiting, en
slaving. "Saint Germain" says:
"Is it not appalling, that Sons and Daughters of
God will submit to the binding chains of limita
tion, when with persistent effort and determina
tion they would open the door and step through
into this great Inner Chamber, filled with such
Dazzling Light, jewels, gold, and substance
from which every kind of food in the Universe
can be precipitated?" (Page 68, "Discourses.")
Yet, despite this assurance of precipitation, the students of
the "I AM," and the "Messengers" themselves, still persist in
using man-made cars, factory-made clothes, and are not averse
to eating kitchen-made food.
Some there are who say they have made certain "demon
strations" of food, money, clothing, etc., but always it is found
that some human hand or physical machine created these things.
Somebody worked! —the man sitting at the bench and the man
who invented and built the machine.

Now let us further analyze this thing of demanding some
thing. Who is it that is doing the demanding?
Is it the "Mighty I AM Presence"? Does that Presence ever
want food, jewels, clothing, etc?
No, it is not the Presence. It is the DESIRE BODY. It is
this that wants beautiful raiment, comforts of life, money, jew
els, gold, and precipitations of all kinds. The True Self
has need of none of these things. It is the desire body that has
the physical body parade about in beautiful cars, furs, and
gorgeous gowns. It is the desire body that wants glory, power,
and a large following.
What right has the desire body to make decrees and de
mands? It has no real authority. It is—or should be—only
the Servant of the Indwelling Presence of God.
Most people, if they are honest with themselves, will admit
that many things that the desire body wishes or demands may
not be good for their Soul's salvation. "Things are in the sad
dle and ride mankind," someone has said. They may tie the
unsuspecting too much to the God of Mammon and to the King
doms of earth. Jesus Himself said that it was hard for a rich
man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
To demand something that does not belong to us constitutes
mental highway robbery.
Please understand me in this. It seems perfectly legitimate
to desire and hold in our mind the things that we really need,
providing they will not bring harm to anybody else. But we
should hardly expect to get them unless we render some kind
of service in exchange. To demand, command, and decree that
they come, irrespective of services or effect on others, is certain
ly going contrary to Cosmic Law. It constitutes a raid on the
Universal Bank Account.

Saint Germain assertedly said: "You can just as easily find
$10,000 in your pocket as TEN CENTS," but certainly spend
ing most of one's time sitting around decreeing this $10,000
into one's pocket instead of what may be the usual dime, is
not the Christ-like Way of Life.
How much safer and more honest would it be to abide by
the great Law of Justice which gives to each the fruits of his
own mental and physical labors. We may temporarily play
with this Law, and perhaps during this life live on the work of
others. But then, you know:
"Though the mills of God grind slowly,
Yet they grind exceeding small;
Though with patience He stands waiting,
With exactness grinds He all."
Friedrich von Logan, "Poetic Aphorisms."
SOME OF THE BALLARD DECREES
As is well known, the students of the Ballards spend much
time in class work making decrees about the Government, the
Constitution, and individuals generally who presumably are
not serving the Light.
It might be well to ask in this regard, how do these students
know beyond peradventure of a doubt that a certain individual
or individuals are not serving the Light? Abraham Lincoln in
his day was considered by millions of people a menace to his
country, and Jesus Himself was called names that we would
rather not mention.
Yet, despite this human tendency to err in judgment, the Bal
lard students invoke what they call the "Blue Lightning" into
any condition which they think should be straightened out, to:

"Blast its cause and effect from the face of the
earth forever!"
In another one of their decrees they project the "Blue Light
ning" (which they always do with the idea of blasting from the
face of the earth forever) into:
"Any activity that seeks to interfere with the suc
cess of the 'I AM' work."
By the "I AM Work," of course, they mean the Ballard brand
of
it,
as they —and only they —have the correct "I AM" teach
ings, being authorized "messengers" to specifically give
it
out.
Other organizations doing similar work are not recognized by
the Ballards, and
it
is
conceivable that these organizations
might easily come under this ban or "taboo." Anybody who
has an honest criticism of their work, or who questions
it
enough
to interfere with
it,
is
in "danger" of having this "Blue Light
ning" directed at him. This Brochure of course —and the form
er one—come under this "taboo"; but
I
question whether all
the "blasting" and "Blue Lightning" in the world can stop the
progress of Truth.
Another decree
is
in regard to their monthly magazine and
their three books, which in part is:
"Shall be the most sought after periodical and
books on the face of this planet."
It
is
strange that they should have to make such decrees about
"an Ascended Master's work."
If
it
were,
it
would not need
such questionable human assistance.
Still another decree —in part—
is
to say dynamically with
hands pointing towards the earth:
"CHARGE the Gas Belts below the earth's surface
with power from the Ascended Masters and the
Legions of Light!"

By these "Gas Belts" they refer to certain "force areas" con
fined in the earth, which assertedly are responsible for earth
quakes and other catastrophes. Occult writers have variously
described them. Perhaps, as they say, it may be true that we
are to have more than the usual disturbance from them. I do
not know. But I do question the advisability of a great number
of people congregating together for the purpose of charging
them with additional power, or fooling with something they
know so little, if anything, about.
If it is true, as occultists say, that the surface of our conti
nent has to be changed from time to time to allow for progress
and new development, and that this change is maneuvered by the
Great Hierarchies who have charge of continental changes, then
these students are interfering with necessary changes to our
continent if their decrees are effective; and if they are not ef
fective, then they are very foolish human beings imagining they
are doing something great and wonderful when they are not.
A friend of mine summed it up very crudely, but certainly
very clearly, when he said : "If we haven't control over our own
'gas belt,' certainly we haven't control over the gas belt of the
earth!" I do not quote this merely to be facetious, for there
is a profound truth in
it,
inasmuch as our body
is
said to be an
analogy or copy in miniature of the Great Body of the Earth
and Universe.
The interior of the earth has many secrets and mysteries, and
until we are better informed by sources more reliable and ac
curate than those of the Ballards,
it
is
best to play safe, and:
"Pray that God's divine Plan may manifest upon earth"
instead of decreeing things that we know so little about.

USE OF THE VIOLET CONSUMING FLAME
Outstanding among the Ballard doctrines is their insistence
that students make daily and hourly use of the "Violet Consum
ing Flame."
We refer you to their long article on this subject in the May,
1936 issue of the "Voice of the I AM," entitled "The Violet
Consuming Flame." This article begins with the following
statement:
"The conscious use of the Violet Consuming
Flame is the only means by which any human
being can free himself from his own human dis
cord and imperfection."
It is strange that if mankind's salvation from "human dis
cord and imperfection" is dependent upon the use of the Violet
Consuming Flame that it was not given before to humanity by
the great Teachers who have come at every age. Why has this
salvation formula been a patented process until the advent of
the Ballards, who now release it to the world? Why did not
Confucius, Buddha, and the Christ mention it?
On page 17 in this same article the Ballards say of this Vio
let Consuming Flame, that:
"This is the Grace which Jesus taught and the
only way—in heaven or earth —by which any in
dividual attains the state of the Ascended Mas
ter . . ."
Only by the widest stretch of the imagination can one con
nect the Grace of Jesus Christ with the Violet Consuming Flame
of the Ballards. The Gospel writer, John, says:
"For the Law was given by Moses, but grace
and truth came by Jesus Christ." (John 1:17.)

Another reference is when Paul besought the Christ about the
"thorn in his flesh," and received the answer:
"My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
made perfect in weakness." (II Cor. 12:9.)
And Paul says of this answer:
"Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me." (II Cor. 12:9.)
Paul here evidently received "grace" from the Christ, but
nowhere does he say this was the "Violet Consuming Flame,"
nor does he throw this flame through him to consume the "thorn
in his flesh." On the contrary, he "gloried in his infirmities."
Nowhere does the Christ associate His grace with a flame. In
fact, it seems that He only mentions "grace" in this instance
that Paul tells of, although Paul himself refers to it many times.
It also occurs many times in the Old Testament, but nowhere
with the idea of the Ballards' "Violet Consuming Flame."
The writer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica says:
"In the New Testament grace is the forgiving
mercy of God, as opposed to any human merit."
How then can grace be used in the sense of the Ballards' idea
that:
". . . . Every individual must purify his own crea
tions by his own conscious application and use
of the Violet Consuming Flame. It is not pos
sible for anyone to do it for him." (Page 17-18.)
Again, in this same article the Ballards say:
"The Violet Consuming Flame can ONLY be
focused, projected and brought into activity by
the 'Mighty I AM Presence.'
" (Page 20.)

Yet, paradoxically, they tell their students to consciously
draw this flame through their bodies by means of their OWN
power of imagination:
"Feel yourself always surrounded by a Great
Pillar of Violet Consuming Flame, the shade of
the violet Neon signs, with the Flame flowing
from the feet upward through the body to the top
of the head and up into your own 'Mighty I AM
Presence.'" (Page 23.)
According to this latter statement, the "Mighty I AM Pres
ence" does NOT draw this flame. It is projected by the Human
Personality, i. e., the mind and feeling part of the person.
According to the former statement it "can only be focused, pro
jected and brought into activity by the "Mighty I AM Pres
ence." Both statements cannot be true; one contradicts the
other, to the mental confusion of the student.
Just to cite another contradiction, they say in reference to
the student's use of the Violet Consuming Flame, that:
"It is not possible for anyone else to do it for
him." (Pages 17-18.)
Yet in this same article they urge doctors and nurses to use
it for their patients:
"to handle the discordant conditions of mind and
body of afflicted human beings," and "bring lim
itless help to their patients." (Page 22.)
Now, why waste the time of a busy doctor and nurse trying to
draw a flame through the body of a patient when they say "it
is not possible for anyone else to do it for him"?
"Since he created his imperfections and limita
tions, so must he uncreate and purify them . . ."

If only the patient can help himself, and the doctor is pow
erless, why waste his time drawing a flame through the bodies
of his patients? In one place they say he is powerless to help;
in another place they say he can perform miracles.
It is quite evident from all of the above that the use of the
Violet Consuming Flame to get rid of one's Karma is an idea
that belongs to the Ballards. They not only make contradictory
statements about
it,
but they offer no real proof that the real
Saint Germain or any other authority—past or present —sanc
tions its use. This being so,
it
would seem that we should be
cautious about playing with something we know so little about —
at least until we have information more reliable and trustworthy
than that of the Ballards. God
is
indeed Light, and He mani
fests in various rays and colors. No doubt we will make in
creasing use of His rays, but
if
we are wise we will not enter
a
Power Station and fool around with the switches unless we
know what we are about or are properly instructed. We have
gotten along without the use of the Violet Consuming Flame
for thousands of years. Perhaps
it
might be well to wait
a
year
or two longer and observe first how
it
works for those who are
determined to use it.
"THE ASCENSION" ACCORDING TO OCCULT
SCIENCE
Occult tradition teaches that mankind has been going through
an evolutionary journey on earth extending over many millions
of years. This
is
accomplished by recurrent earth lives. The
Immortal Spirit in man,
a
citizen of heaven, dips down into the
mundane sphere at intervals for the purpose of conquering the
earth and for the evolution of seZ/-consciousness into God-coa

sciousness. Between these earth lives there are heaven experi
ences of much longer durations, for the purpose of assimilation
of earth's experiences and the development of soul-power.
Humanity, according to this teaching, is but a little ways be
yond the half-way mark in its evolutionary career on earth.
It still has a long, long journey and many, many lives on earth
before it can achieve as a whole the Perfection planned for it
during this Great Day of Manifestation.
Liberation from these many earth lives, freedom from this
ever-recurring and revolving Wheel of Birth and Rebirth,
occurs at the end of man's long pilgrimage through matter, or
when he has achieved in a very real sense the Perfection planned
for him.
Man will at that future time have no further need for a physi
cal body. He will leave it where it belongs —to the earth plane.
He will not take it with him. But he will extract the finer bod
ies and the forces of his physical body, and will carry these
with him to the higher levels of consciousness into the spiritual
worlds. The great purpose of evolution will then have been
achieved, and man will no longer be chained to the Wheel of
Birth and Death. He descends no more to the earth plane for
the purpose of birth, or as the writer of the last book in the
New Testament puts it:
"He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar
in the temple of my God, and he shall go out
thence no more." (Rev. 3:12.)
In Christian terminology this victory over death is called the
Ascension, which was achieved by Christ, the Great Way-
shower, as an example for all mankind to some day follow.
The journey through these many lives may be hastened, ac
cording to occult teachings, by means of what is known as Ini

tiation, accomplished under the direct tutorship or guardian
ship of the Great Masters of Humanity who have achieved part
ly or wholly this great consummation of earth existence.
The path of progress, however, for the multitude is differ
ent. It is envisioned as a spiral journey up and around a moun
tain side, a slow, plodding procession, which in the course of
eons will take humanity to the mountain peak of achievement —
the Ascension. But the pathway for the initiated few is
straight up the barren, rugged face of the mountain, a short,
steep, perilous ascent which only the courageous may dare un
dertake.
These two paths are also indicated diagramatically by that
mystic symbol of antiquity —the caduceus. The spiral journey
of the many is shown by the entwined serpents ; the staff or wand
of Mercury indicates the "straight and narrow path" of Initia
tion,
"Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way,
which leadeth unto life, and few there be that
find it." (Matt. 7:14.)
The overshadowing wings above the staff of Mercury and
the serpents, however, indicate the ultimate freedom for both
classes of souls.
So much for the occult teachings regarding man's pilgrimage
on earth and the glorious achievement and victory that lies
ahead of him.
THE BALLARDS' IDEA OF THE ASCENSION
We come now to the Ballard teaching regarding the pilgrim
age of man and his ultimate achievement of the Ascension. The
general idea has been drawn unquestionably from occult sourc

es, and therefore is quite familiar to occult students. But there
is one statement which sets at naught everything that ever has
been taught: Mr. Ballard claims that in 1932, at the mandate
of a Great Master from the planet Venus, "the old occult or
der was set aside."
No longer now does the multitude have to follow the long
spiral path of evolution; no longer does the initiated one have
to walk the straight path. For the initiatory steps are now, ac
cording to Mr. Ballard, no longer necessary. The Ascension
can be achieved in this life! The Great Wheel of Birth and
Death can suddenly be stopped, the Karma of the past can be
magically wiped out, with the result that the individual soars
physically into the firmament, a Master of Heaven and Earth,
an Ascended Being!
The method of achieving this marvelous result is merely the
use of the Violet Consuming Flame. By imagining a violet
Same passing upwards through his body the individual wipes
out the Karma of the past, cleans up his present body and
aura, and by calling on his "Mighty I AM Presence" for his
Ascension, he achieves the grand object of his entire evolution
in this very life!
If for some reason the Ascension is not made in the present
embodiment, Mr. Ballard assures his "I AM" students that it
will undoubtedly be made in the next, for, he says : "Saint Ger
main has promised that all sincere students of the 'I AM' will be
taken to the feet of an Ascended Master when they pass over,
and be given special instruction which will insure their making
the Ascension in the next life."
Now it is a fine thing to give encouragement to students. It
may even be advisable not to tell the students of all the difficult
steps that lie ahead of them. But when it comes to guarantee

ing a student's Ascension within a short period of two lives, the
only requirement being that he be a faithful member of the
Ballard "I AM" family and use the "Violet Consuming Flame,"
that is going just too far.
This thing of decreeing one's Ascension in this life, irrespec
tive of whether the student is in any way ready for
it,
is
simply
one of the foolish things of life.
It
resolves itself down to this:
such students try to escape valuable lessons of life which they
haven't had or have not yet learned.
It
is
analogous to
a
soph
omore at the University, who, having passed his freshman ex
aminations, says vainly that there
is
no need for him to pass
through the junior and senior grades of college, for, really, he
is
ready to graduate NOW. The University officials would cer
tainly not mince words in setting this conceited individual
straight.
THE LAW OF FORGIVENESS
In mystic literature one finds mentioned two great spiritual
laws: the Law of Karma and the Law of Forgiveness.
These two laws are also powerfully enunciated in the Bible.
Jehovah, the Law-Giver, instructs Moses regarding the first
law in the following words:
"Thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth
for tooth . .
.
."
(Ex. 21:23-24.)
Paul, hundreds of years later, states this same law forcibly
in these words:
"Be not deceived; God
is
not mocked: for what
soever
a
man soweth, that shall he also
reap." (Gal. 6:7.) .

The second law — the Law of Forgiveness — is scattered
throughout the literature of the New Testament, and is often
times referred to as "grace." It is stated by John thus:
"For the Law was given by Moses, but grace and
truth came by Jesus Christ." (John 1:17.)
In other words, the law of the Old Testament of an "eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth," according to this, may be trans
cended by the New Dispensation of Christ, giving "grace" or
forgiveness. Or otherwise expressed, the law given by Paul of
"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" may, under
certain conditions, give way to a higher law expressed by the
"grace of Jesus Christ."
Now what are these conditions for forgiveness? "Repent
ye!" says the voice of John the Baptist crying in the wilderness,
and throughout the Gospel writings it is unmistakably shown
that repentance is the price of the Forgiveness of Sins.
Nowhere in the Bible is there reference to the necessity of
sweeping a "Violet Flame" through the body as a requirement
for this cleansing or forgiveness. Rather, a contrite heart was
to acknowledge one's sins with sufficient intensity, showing that
the lesson had been learned, whereby the great "Law of Moses"
(Karma or the Law of Cause and Effect) could be abrogated
and the "grace of Jesus Christ" (forgiveness) take its place.
Some occult schools stress not only Repentance, but also
the necessity for Reform and Restitution. In other words,
not only a heart-felt repentance but an actual physical reform,
and, so far as possible, making things straight with the persons
injured or the equivalent of it.
Now if you will search through the Ballard books you will
find practically no mention, if any, of the necessity of Repent
ance, Reform, and Restitution. You will find you do not have

to be repentant to use the "Violet Consuming Flame" to get rid
of your karma or sins. You merely have to imagine this flame
with sufficient intensity passing through your body. There is no
stressing of any actual physical reform. There is no mention
made of the necessity of trying, so far as possible, to set things
straight. A bank president who defrauds a thousand persons
out of their life-long savings may by the expedient of merely us
ing the "Violet Consuming Flame" on his fraudulent transac
tions, blot them out, and not return one cent to his victims, nor
necessarily make any true reform.
It is true that with respect to this Law of Forgiveness we deal
with a very debatable question, and it is foolish to be dogmated
either for or against it; but common sense if nothing else should
certainly tell us that it is nonsense to think that all our sins are
blotted out and the entire karma of the past made null and void
by merely sweeping a "violet flame" through the body, or that:
"It but requires firm alert attention and an un
yielding determination to have the same Great
Freedom which Jesus revealed to mankind . . ."
(Article on Violet Consuming Flame, May,
1936, "Voice," Page 19.)
Certainly much more than this is required of us to gain our
Freedom. Jesus Himself revealed unmistakably that it takes
more than "firm alert attention" and "unyielding determina
tion." It took the most heart-rending sacrifice, the most self-
negating humility, and an intense, yearning passionate love of
humanity. All this He felt as He stood on the hill overlooking
Jerusalem and lamented over the sins and wickedness of the
world. His was a mystic baptism in the sorrows of humanity,
and from out of it He arose a Masterful Presence, but withal,
a Man of Sorrows. This Elder Brother of Humanity cannot go

on into the Heights beyond unless He draw all humanity with
Him. He waits for us, for the "manifestation of the sons of
God." We too must feel this same love and devotion to hu
manity, and feel their need and sin as our own. We must walk
in the Garden and up the steep road of Calvary before we are
ready on some blessed Easter morn to ascend as the Son of God.
The grace that saves and forgives is a spiritual downpour
of the Christ Consciousness. We must feel it as Jesus felt it.
It does not come by issuing long decrees demanding and order
ing
it,
but
it
comes wholly unexpectedly as
a
sudden up-welling
of compassionate feeling which conceivably may indeed wipe
away the errors and mistakes of the past until we are made white
as snow. Again, we do not like to dogmatize about
a
mystery as
deep as this, but certainly no lip service, the practice of concen
tration, or straining after the "Violet Consuming Flame" can
possibly nullify the causation or Karma generated throughout
hundreds—
if
not thousands —of lives.
THE BALLARDS' CRITICISM OF ASTROLOGY
In the "I AM Discourses," Page 171, "Saint Germain of the
Ballards" says he has in his possession the records
of
the past
one hundred years, and adds:
"That of which
I
wish to speak today
is
the de
lusion of astrology. . . . There
is
no one thing or
phase of study which has caused more failure or
more indirect murder, than the present delusion
of astrology."
This coming from an alleged "Ascended Master,"
a
"Per
fected Being," has influenced many students of astrology to give
up their studies, burn their books, and to think that all those

who study astrology are either conscious or unconscious agents
of the sinister force.
"The sinister negative force generated by man
kind in the world, always takes advantage of
such things as this to get and hold the atten
tion
"
(Page 172 of the "Discourses.")
Now it doesn't seem possible that the real Saint Germain
should say that astrology is a "delusion." History records that
when this remarkable character was living in Europe during the
eighteenth century he was an adept at all the occult sciences. It
is quite likely that astrology was part of his occult armamentar
ium. Also, according to the Ballards, he was Lord Frances
Bacon in his previous incarnation, who evidently believed in
and wrote upon astrology as you will find in his "Essay on
Prophecies." The Ballards say Lord Bacon wrote the Shake
spearean plays, which are filled with astrological allusions.
He was evidently intensely interested in astrology to be able to
write so much about stellar influences, which fact did not pre
vent him from making his "ascension" in that life, as the Bal
lards say he did. And yet "Saint Germain of the Ballards"
says:
'Wo one living can give his attention to astrology
and enter into the 'Presence of the I AM' and
remain there." (Page 171, "Discourses.")
Lord Bacon not only gave his attention to astrology, but he
did enter into the "Presence of the I AM" sufficiently (accord
ing to the Ballards' statement) to make his "ascension" in that
very life.
If astrology is a "delusion," as the Ballards' "Saint Ger
main" says it
is,
then, there
is
no truth at all in
it
and
it
is
im
possible to receive any influences from the planets and other

heavenly bodies. Yet, paradoxically, "Saint Germain" in his
later discourse on Page 216, says:
"The radiation projected from the stars, so-
called, to our earth do not and cannot come into
contact with the earth without the conscious di
rection of the Cosmic Being, who is the Con
scious Directing Presence of that star or planet."
This is a clear-cut admission that the radiations from stars
or planets DO come in contact with the earth, and if this is so,
then, ASTROLOGY IS NO DELUSION, for astrology is the
science that deals with those radiations or influences.
It used to be the favorite literary sport of old encyclopedic
writers to call astrology a "delusion," by which they meant it
was a false belief. It seems as if "Saint Germain of the Bal-
lards" had been indulging in some old encyclopedic references
when he called astrology a delusion. Ten days later in another
discourse, as noted in the above quotation, he contradicts him
self by saying that planets and stars have an influence after all.
But he adds:
". . . The radiation thus directed does not carry
any adverse aspect to any individual . . ." (Page

"Saint Germain" and the Ballards apparently do not know
that there are literally thousands of astrologers who agree very
much with them that the planets really do not carry any "ad
verse" or "evil" influences to human beings. These negative
terms, they say, are necessarily used to describe the individual's
reaction to the influences from the planets. We cannot, for in
stance, call the potent force that we know as electricity "evil."
We know it is good, but individuals in their ignorance or care
lessness have misused it and suffered consequently. The poor

lineman who gets tangled up in a network of high voltage wires
fifty feet above the ground is in a bad situation. We certainly
wouldn't say it was "good," although there is nothing "evil"
about the electricity itself. In a similar way astrologers apply
—or should apply —the terms "good" and "evil" to the com
plicated network of stellar lines and forces. They are a conven
ience of expression, and have no real basis in fact.
The astrologers of an ancient day were particularly severe
in their description of planets and aspects. Saturn was definite
ly a "malefic"; "Jupiter a "benefic." The old textbooks are
filled with negative expressions of evil portent, and it is this that
has caused so much misunderstanding and criticism of astrolo
gy. The informed astrologer of today is just as anxious as
"Saint Germain" and the Ballards are in clearing up this con
dition and getting over the truth that nothing but good can come
from God and the Planetary Beings who are His Ministers.
Just because a great deal of evil has resulted from the wrong
and perverted use of astrology is no reason to junk the whole of
it. Where would we be if we used this same kind of logic with
respect to other forces that man does not as yet know how to
use? Take, for instance, the Desire Force within humanity.
It is always getting people into trouble. Because of its im
pelling influence some men will murder and steal to gratify
their desire for a palatial home, a beautiful wife, and children.
But if the Great Ones took this Desire Force away from hu
manity, there would be no progress of any kind. And if another
"Gift of the Gods" — electricity —were to be taken away be
cause some individuals did not know how to use
it,
where would
the marvelous civilization of today be?
Similarly,
it
is
with astrology. Some there are whose work
it
is
in life to study and improve
it,

arts are being improved. Why, then, brand conscientious stu
dents of astrology as either conscious or unconscious agents of
the "sinister force," as "Saint Germain" does?
My comments here should not be taken as a wholesale vindi
cation of everything that passes under the name of astrology.
There are too many using the stellar art either in an ig
norant way or who are proselyting on a gullible public. Be
sides, there is much of it that is incapable of exact proof. Those
who call astrology an "exact science" either do not know what
this little word "exact" means, or else they are fatalists. How
can you have anything exact when dealing with human nature?
One never knows exactly how the human animal is going to
jump. He is, perhaps, the most unpredictable creation in na
ture.
The scientific basis for astrology rests on the sure foundation
of the solidarity of the universe. Nothing can take place in this
universe without in some way affecting other parts of it. The
sensitive mind of a poet caught a glimpse of this marvelous cos
mic inter-relationship when he proclaimed:
"All are but parts of one stupendous Whole,
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul."
To deny the reaction that follows an action is to deny not
only one of the basic principles of physics but of life itself.
There can be no movement of one part of the solar system with
out it bringing about a balancing, stabilizing effect in some
other part of the system.
Furthermore, to deny that physical changes produce mental
and spiritual effects is to deny the evidence of psychological
science and your own experiences. You know that your physi
cal state profoundly affects your mental and emotional being.

Therefore, to argue that the physical — and perhaps more
subtle — changes undergone by members of the solar system do
not have a corresponding physical, mental, and spiritual effect
on all other bodies in that system is to deny what is axiomatical-
ly and scientifically true. The fact that an astrologer cannot al
ways predict accurately what effect a certain movement of a
planetary body will have upon the body, mind, and spirit of an
earth-dwelling individual is no argument against astrology, but
merely proof of the mental limitations of the astrologer.
ASTROLOGY AND THE SACRED WRITINGS
Just because something is written in a book does not neces
sarily prove its truth. However, it is an inescapable fact that
in the Bible and other sacred books there are many references
to astrology. Opponents of astrology—who at the same time
believe in these sacred writings —cannot very well explain this
constant allusion to astrology. The Ballards do not attempt to.
In the very first chapter of Genesis we have the Biblical sanc
tion of its use:
"And God said, Let there be lights in the firma
ment of heaven to divide the day from the night;
and let them be for signs and seasons."
In fact, the entire Bible teems with astrological references
and allegories, so much so that it can hardly be understood
rightly without some knowledge of astrology. Everywhere one
meets with a symbolism which is only familiar to astrologers.
The story of Jacob blessing his twelve sons is the Biblical
way of describing how the solar emanations from our sun gives
life and sustenance to the "Twelve Mundane Houses" of the
horoscope. These sons of Jacob gave birth to the "Twelve

Tribes of Israel," which are astrological divisions of humanity,
based on the "Twelve Signs of the Zodiac."
The story of Samson pictorially describes the progress of the
sun through the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. Sam-SON is a
Solar God—a "Sun"—as shown by the ending of his name,
and his hair represents the sun's rays. When the sun reaches
the feminine sign Virgo at the approach of the fall season, the
woman "Delilah" shears his locks and he loses his strength.
Eventually in his journey through the Zodiac he is slain by the
"Philistines," the winter months. But always a new savior—a
Sun (Son)
—is born.
These are solar myths, and are so recognized by many Bible
commentators. It seems to be a fact that the lives of all the
Saviors of mankind are based upon the passage of the sun
around the circle of the Zodiac.
The plans of the Tabernacle given to Moses by Jehovah are
largely astrological. Likewise, the plan for the Temple at Je
rusalem, where we are introduced to the "molten sea" support
ed on the backs of "twelve brazen oxen" In the Holy Place on
the right, we find the "Twelve Loaves of Unleavened Bread,"
and on the left the "Golden Candlestick with its Seven Lamps."
The twelve signs of the zodiac and the seven planetary
spirits are everywhere found in the sacred writings of Christen
dom as well as the "heathen" nations.
The story of Christ, the Son (Sun), and His astrological
grouping of twelve disciples, shows that even this Master of
Wisdom was subject to stellar laws. His reference to "Mine
hour is not yet come" (John 2:4) perhaps had an astrological
meaning, as did many of His other expressions. The various
symbols He was connected with are astrological in nature, such
as "Lamb of God," corresponding to Aries, the Ram ; and He

was also a "Fisher of Men," corresponding to Pisces, the Fish
es. The sun—by "precession of the equinoxes"—was at that
time going through Aries, the Ram, and preceding backwards
into Pisces, the Fishes. Therefore, some of his disciples were
"fishermen" and they were to save the lost "sheep" of Israel.
Christ was the "Good Shepherd," etc. The symbols of His
church are also in some instances astrologic, as for instance the
Bishop's mitre is in the form of the head of a fish. The festivals
of His church, such as Easter and Christmas, are largely based
on astronomical movements of the heavens.
Profound astrological knowledge was evidently possessed by
the writers of the books of both the Old and New Testaments.
Paul says that "Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians" (Acts 7:22), and of course that included astrology
as these ancients were adepts in it. We meet it in the writings
of Ezekiel, Daniel, and Saint John the Divine. In fact, this last
and perhaps the greatest of the books of the Bible —the Apoca
lypse or the Revelation of St. John the Divine —is undecipher
able without the key of astrology.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built in accordance with an
astronomical plan, and its builders were evidently astrologers
of profound wisdom. Masonry itself has many astrological al
lusions, and is more understandable with an astrological key.
The Great Seal of the United States has a Masonic origin, and
included in its symbolism there is much astrology.
The great temples of India, Chaldea, Persia, and those re
maining of the lost continent of Atlantis in our own Americas
are mute evidences of the universality of astrology. In fact,
studded over this earth of ours are astrological symbols and
monuments, such as pyramids, sphinxes, obelisks, temples, and

zodiacs, all bearing concrete testimony of the belief of ancient
peoples in this mysterious and little understood science.
This being so, it is hardly fair to condemn the whole of as
trology because it has been misused, or to class it as a "delu
sion." There is a higher or spiritual side to astrology which
many sincere students are endeavoring to bring out. That as
trological symbols were placed in the sacred temples and books
of practically all races surely bespeaks of the possibility that
there was a heavenly design or a spiritual purpose for so doing.
THE "I AM" AND YOUR HOROSCOPE
If the study of the personal side of astrology is going to make
the student forget his "Mighty Presence Within" and become
mixed-up in a lot of negative aspects, then I think he is better
off without such study. Personal interpretation of aspects,
planets, and signs from textbooks are very, very misleading.
Unless one can learn to synthesize these various meanings, a lot
of negative suggestions are sent out into the ethers, as "Saint
Germain" truly says. Much which passes for modern day astrol
ogy —usually of the "fortune-telling" variety—is enough to
make not only angels but real astrologers weep.
The stellar art is a two-edged sword which only a com
parative few can handle as yet. Astrologers are born, and
not made. And unless one has a real aptitude for
it,
and has
the time and energy to devote to
it,
it
is
my conviction that
it
is
best to leave its close study to specialists and research students,
and to devote one's energies serving in his own department
of life.
It
is
sufficient perhaps to be familiar with some of the
symbols, and the cosmic or spiritual significance of astrology.
This thing of fearing to make the slightest move or change

unless one looks up "what the stars say" is limiting and stifling
to freedom of soul expression. If we followed absolutely what
the textbooks say, for fear of running into some "adverse as
pects," we wouldn't do anything. The greatest experience in
our life, and the greatest soul unfoldment, may come through
these very aspects or influences. If, for instance, one is con
vinced that a certain action is absolutely the right thing to do,
why should he hesitate to execute it because some astrologer or
textbook said it would be done under a "square" or adverse
aspect? Do you think that the crucifixion of Christ was done
under a harmonious, beautiful, benign, so-called "good" as
pect? Do you think that this great Soul would have hesitated
because He saw a lot of "squares" in his horoscope? Neither
should we if we want our true freedom, as He has attained His.
Whatever any astrologer may tell you about your personal
horoscope, just take it with the proverbial grain of salt, for he
like all human beings is fallible. The "I AM" is greater than
any horoscope, for before the solar system was, the Spirit that
is YOU rested in the bosom of its Father-Mother-God. And af
ter this solar system ceases to be, and the charts and glyphs of
the astrologer are no more, this same eternal flame of life
will course triumphantly down the vast corridors of Time —a
master over every limiting condition, a victor over death.
"The stars shall fade away; the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;
But THOU shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amid the war of elements,
The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds."
—Addison.

SYMPATHY, SERVICE, AND SOUL-GROWTH
One of the most serious omissions in the Ballard teachings
is that hardly anything is said about the Christ-like virtues of
sympathy and service to others. Whatever is said of these vir
tues is usually in a derogatory sense.
"What is sympathy?" someone asks "Saint Germain of the
Ballards," and he answers:
"/* is but agreement with imperfection. What
ever you do, be adamant before human sympa
thy." (Page 72, "Discourses.")
So it appears that the Christ was wrong in telling the par
able of the "Good Samaritan." This kindly, sympathetic Sa
maritan —who by the way was not of the hypocritical priestly
caste—recognized the "imperfection" of the poor man who had
been beset by robbers and who lay helpless upon the road to
Jericho. So he rendered some needed physical service instead
of merely "holding the thought" that he would get well. And
the Christ said: "Go, and do thou likewise."
Yet, "Saint Germain," whom the Ballards say is the present
close associate of this same Christ of the Gospels in getting over
the Ballards' "I AM Work," says:
"The performance of physical acts for gratifying
and satisfying of the limitations of the human
self is not service, never was, and never will
be." (Page 128, "Magic Presence.")
Nada, the "Lady Master of the Ballards," says:
"Never let any desire for service deprive you of
the needed time—undivided —to fix your atten
tion and acceptance on your "Great Master
Within," knowing then that you will naturally

give the right service, and do the right thing."
(Page 130, "Magic Presence.")
The Christ of the Gospels said nothing like these two quota
tions, but on the contrary said:
"He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."
(Matt. 10:39.)
Is it not true that this intended worship of the "Mighty I AM
Presence" is likely to be shunted off onto the "little self"?
How many of the Ballard students are really sincerely worship
ing the Christ Self? If they were, this worship would by the
law of life flow out to others as automatically as the great river
flows out into the ocean. There would be no argument about
"needed time—undivided —" to fix your attention on the "Great
Master Within," as Nada says. The trouble is that the Ballard
students are tempted to use "Nada's Letter on Service" and
"Saint Germain's" denouncement of sympathy as a specious
argument to themselves to get out of doing something for their
fellow man and doing a lot for the "little self"—the self that
wants gold, jewels, glory, power, cars, furs, and personal es
teem. And that is just what the average human mortal wants.
And that is one reason why the Ballards attract large crowds.
And that is why the Christ said it was hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.
If there is any teaching intended eventually to make its ad
herents selfish, unfeeling, and unsympathetic toward their fel
low man, and glory in their own little selves, it is such a teach
ing as this. The anecdote for it is a reading of the life of Jesus
the Christ.
"Loving, Self-forgetting Service to Others" is usually the
price set upon Initiation into the Mysteries, but in the Ballard
teaching it is emphatically not so.

Friends, write it on your hearts that Soul-growth is accom
plished by the alchemy of work, service, and self-control —
not self-worship. One must forget himself to find himself.
Fixing your attention on the God Within without letting your
love flow out to all humanity is merely worship of the "little
self," and you will not make the grade in two lives, nor in ten
thousand lives.
CONCLUSION
The material for this brochure has grown to such an extent
that such subjects as Twin Rays, the Akashic Records, Af
firmations, Prophesies, Catas trophies, Occult Retreats,
Golden Ages, the Ascended Masters, Non-belief in Physi
cal Remedies, Animals a Condensation of Evil, and other
Ballards teachings have necessarily been crowded out. Their
consideration will form a part of Brochure No. 3.
When Brochure No. 1 was off the press, I immediately sent
Mr. Ballard a copy by registered mail, with the following let
ter:
August 16, 1936.
My Dear Mr. Ballard:
You will recall that during the early part of this year I had
an interview with you at the Hotel Figueroa in Los Angeles
concerning certain dates in "Unveiled Mysteries" and the "Mag
ic Presence," which contradicted the dates given in the "I AM
Discourses."
You were unable to explain in that interview about these
dates, and said that you would have to have time to look them
over in preparing for a new edition.

1
Later, I tried at various times to get another interview with
you to see if you could in any way explain these date contra
dictions, but each time I was not permitted to see you.
I then wrote you a letter marked "personal" listing some
questions and asking you to mark only on the paper "yes" or
"no" (which would have only taken a minute of your time)
and send it back in the enclosed self-addressed stamped envel
ope. You replied in no way to this inquiry.
Since then I have published a brochure which is just off the
press, and which deals with these contradictions. I am taking
the liberty of sending a copy to you herewith.
If you are in any way able to explain these discrepancies of
dates and inaccuracies of subject matter, I will feel greatly
obligated to make an announcement of your explanation and
publicly apologize to you for having misjudged you or your
writings, and do everything in my power to set matters straight.
I close with the sincere wish that your "Mighty I AM Pres
ence" may ever light your way through life.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) Gerald B. Bryan.
Up to this time (one month after) I have received no answer
nor explanation from Mr. Ballard. If I do, it will be consid
ered, if possible, in the forthcoming publication, Brochure
No. 3.
There seems to be no doubt that today we live at a time when
the entire world is going through an important evolutionary
change. The way the Ballard teachings have spread shows
that people are either becoming more sensitive to influences
from the invisible worlds, or they are developing more curiosity
concerning them, perhaps, because of the fact that the Ballards

teach that the Beings or entities found there may be made to
render certain personal assistance by decreeing them to do so.
Now this psychic world, or rather the lower levels of
it,
con
tains some of the most malevolent influences imaginable. There
are dangers to be found there to which nothing on the earth
plane
is
comparable. The truly Great Masters of Wisdom who
blazed the original trail through this wilderness of mystery and
psychism knew of these dangers, and they erected certain sign
posts, certain warnings given in the scriptural statements and
in the legitimate mystery schools.
It
is
not usually
a
mark of
greatness to ignore signals. Signals are needed along the trail
to the invisible worlds
;
and ifanyone doubts this, let him inter
view some of the poor souls who have ignorantly or defiantly
chased through one of the cosmic traffic signals.
This
is
one of the reasons that influenced me to publish this
series of brochures.
I
am convinced that what
is
needed in
going through this transitional change of consciousness
is
DISCRIMINATION. Ability to discriminate between the real
and the unreal, the spiritual and the psychic, the true and the
false.
Discrimination
is
the only quality to which we have access
that will save us in the times that are ahead of us.
The brand of "love" that we usually talk about more or less
inanely will not save us. We do not as yet know what real love
is. The love that incites you to follow
a
leader or
a
teacher
is
not the love that Christ felt as he walked footsore and weary
the dusty roads of Palestine. His was
a
love that went out to
all humanity, whatever the race, color, sex, or creed.
It
was
a
love such as the great Lincoln must have felt in some degree as
he labored for the emancipation of the black man.

Until we can measure up to such a love as the Christ love,
then I don't know what else we can rely on except this inner
spiritual quality which some call discrimination. Discrimina
tion is the God-in-you sorting over the mixture of truths and
fallacies that are so often presented on a golden platter, intend
ed to deceive even the elect, if that were possible—and it seems
to be.
The spiritual quality of Intuition is a helpful ally, but psych-
ism or some subtle thought influence from the lower psychic
world may be mistaken for it. Everything that flashes through
from the other side of life does not necessarily come from a
high spiritual source. If it cannot stand the test of a little anal
ysis or if it goes against your intuitive sense of morality, jus
tice, and truth, it comes to you labeled with the earmarks of the
lower astral despite its claim to the contrary.
Negatively sitting in the silence waiting for some "spirit" to
use your mind or body is folly. Positively approaching life
and its phenomena with a discriminative mind and a compas
sion for all of human kind, is certain victory.
