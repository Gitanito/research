  		              		Experience Description   

    I bled out on the floor of the emergency room when the tube burst from the ectopic pregnancy.  I was taken to a small treatment room where numerous responders worked over me. 

   I was above myself and high up in the rafters staring down at the hustle and bustle going on below me. I could see them  poking,  prodding, and examining me.  I listened as they said, 'She's gone.'  It was late at night and the attending doctor didn't have the necessary signing authority for the time-of-the-death certificate.  They called for an authorized person to sign.   I watched as my body was wiped off with some of the gore as everyone else stood quietly waiting.  I think about 15  minutes passed. Then a woman with red hair entered.  She took up the chart and said, 'She is too young. Let's try something else.'  

 I was unaware of anything after that except that it was freezing cold.   I woke up 4 days later.   When I asked about the red haired woman, everybody got very antsy. They said I couldn't have seen her because at that stage I was dead.
