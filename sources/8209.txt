  		              		Experience Description   

    I was having a tubal ligation procedure.  Since I had been diagnosed with severe hypoglycemia at age 25, and it had not yet stabilized by age 30, I feared that a pregnancy could be disastrous.  I had a bad reaction to anesthesia when both my blood sugar and blood pressure crashed.  I had the sensation of "floating" above the operating table.  I very calmly watched all the surgical personnel being upset.  I heard a nurse yell out "We almost lost her" and I came back.  So, my near-death experience probably lasted only a minute or so, but I never forgot it.
