 Revista de Estudios Psicologicos.
 Other titles: Plus-Ultra
 1925â€“1927  Monthly
 Madrid, Spain.  Language:  Spanish.  Editor: Abdeon Sanchez Herrero.
 Corporate author:  Organo del Centro Platon
 1/1, October 1925-September 1927.  16 pp., 5 pesetas a year.

 This was the organ of the Center  "Plato" in Madrid, led by Abdeon Sanchez Herrero.  It was designed as a "propaganda sheet" to clear "the way forward and indicate to neophytes in spiritist beliefs the delights that the believing soul would find" in the movement.  The Center offered (for 3.5 pesetas a month) seances, lectures, a library, teaching courses, etc.  The journal was largely written by Sanchez Herrero, with contributions by Antonio Palmero Fernandez, Juan Tebar, and others of the period, and regularly contained a correspondence section and bibliography.  In its last known issue (September 1927) the journal noted its permanent deficit and lamented the fact that it had been able to garner only 165 subscribers in a country with "millions of spiritualists."
