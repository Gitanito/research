one of the documents that I put in this
stop the dis brief this is the initial
briefing we put together for President
Obama shortly after he got into office
and I keep it here at this building for
reasons of briefing it&#39;s not the only
copy you don&#39;t worry but in it you know
one of the documents that I was very key
to emphasize was the 1951 document from
Canada from Wilbur Smith a top-secret
document they accidentally Declassified
that states that this is the most
sensitive issue in the history of the
United States it is the most secret that
there was a team headed up by dr.
Vannevar Bush who was the guy who was
the Czar over the whole Manhattan
Project that IDI you know Edward Teller
and Oppenheim Herbert if you look him up
in history Vannevar Bush was one of the
key people who and that team headed up
the study of these so-called flying
saucers as they were called back how
quaintly in 1950 or from 1915 when that
document came out and the secrecy around
that was so great that in this memo it
states not only do these flying saucers
exist and there&#39;s a group studying the
modus operandi I&#39;m quoting the method of
action and technology behind them but
that it was the more secret than the
development of the hydrogen bomb now
remember the h-bomb everybody know the
difference between a atomic bomb and a
nuclear bomb most people don&#39;t an atomic
bomb is fissile material okay so what we
unfortunately dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki was a very in a sense
low-yield fission reaction where you
split the atom a thermonuclear bomb has
that within it and then it goes to a
fusion like the Sun reaction and is a
hundred thousand times more powerful and
so the h-bomb the hydrogen bomb which
are what is the standard use today in
the world at least by an
and others is a thermonuclear fusion
bomb uncontrolled which much more
powerful than an atomic bomb most people
have no idea the difference between
atomic and I mean these get conflated I
want to be clear there was no no reason
for us not to be educated in 2014 and so
we&#39;ll have questions later at the last
hour it&#39;s because it&#39;s not mic so what
you have to understand is that that was
the ultimate doomsday weapon the
hydrogen bomb and this memo which has
never been contested states that the
projects dealing with the modus operandi
the technologies of these UFOs was a
bigger secret in the United States than
the hydrogen bomb so if you just think
about the implications of that for a
moment then you begin to realize what
kind of things would be done to keep
this genie in the bottle and has been
done now that it&#39;s starting the 40s 50s
no t Townsend browned
many of you know of the RAND Corporation
he became someone who was a key figure
in the development of the RAND
Corporation t Townsend Brown and all
this information is at serious
disclosure calm if you click on the
energy button and go to all the links
there are documents there&#39;s all this
that he was the man who figured out that
if you put a certain type of high
voltage resonant field using crystalline
structures that you would get lift and
actually the crystals would begin to
look like they were expanding and did
expand take up more space amazing and
they would cause a lifting effect that
was in the late 20s 1920s the Kowski
frost experiment that was then done in
1928 or 29 in germany reproduced that
but did even more work on it so it isn&#39;t
as if this all started after Roswell or
something there were classified projects
looking into this effect of very high
voltage systems lift effect mass
cancellation so if something becomes
massless
anybody knew your physics equations
velocity is equal to and but it&#39;s
inversely proportional to the mass so go
run your equation and when mass
disappears theoretically velocity can go
to infinity but what actually happens
when it becomes massless and a massless
particle boom it&#39;s actually in another
dimension so this is why you can get
these objects if you look at our radar
tapes if you look at the disclosure
project witnesses that serious
disclosure calm thanks to the work of
some folks who worked with me for less
than 15 or 20 years we have several
dozen of these people up there one of
them John Callahan was to doing the case
with the you know the airline Japan
Airlines in Alaska in the early 80s and
you know he was flying along with a
polar route 747 and this massive UFO
extraterrestrial vehicle actually is
what they&#39;re called et V&#39;s it&#39;s what
they&#39;re called an NSA National Security
Agency appeared and was this man it was
the size of a destroyer or larger on the
ocean but it was up in the air and with
one radar sweep it would then be 180
degrees the other way moving completely
nonlinearly or in ways that we&#39;re
inexplicable does anyone flying a jet
all right or rocket so that radar tape
we have the original four because this
chief of the investigation unit for the
FAA took it with him when he retired and
gave it to the disclosure project so
it&#39;s in my vault you get the sense of
this then that anyone who&#39;s gotten close
to the subject knows that we&#39;re not
dealing with your Grandad&#39;s oldsmobile
or jet or rocket and that is the crux of
the problem is that it is such a big
leap in technology from where we are now
that a lot of people say it&#39;s great but
it&#39;s too disruptive and as the man at
the University Club told me no one who
gets into a powerful position in
government wants to
have to deal with that much change it&#39;s
just too much change to deal with now
unfortunately it would have been a
manageable change between 1910 and 1930
but we missed that window and I wasn&#39;t
alive then anyway so I couldn&#39;t have
helped you neither was anyone else in
this room I suspect unless you&#39;ve aged
very well you&#39;re not a hundred years old
so the question becomes why hasn&#39;t
someone if these technologies are real
done something with it well they have
and it turns out if you look at the
history of this T Townsend Brown started
out in the open world and then got
pulled in by the military with his
anti-gravity work that then got pulled
into the RAND Corporation we have people
like Stan Meyer and you&#39;ve heard this
people think is an urban myth or not
that that mr. Meyer had a car running on
water that had one of these
electrolyzers that would take water
dissociate it into hydrogen and oxygen
and run it in real time without a fuel
sale without storing it yes he did
unfortunately he falsified all his
patents which vitiated at their legal
viability because he didn&#39;t want anyone
to know his little secret and then he
died mysteriously after he was meeting
with some people from NATO ran out of a
Cracker Barrel and somewhere I think in
Tennessee and collapsed in the parking
lot saying I&#39;ve been poisoned I&#39;ve been
poisoned I&#39;m in poison now my team has
met with his twin brother who actually
did the circuits for him in the 80s and
90s and this is a very doable
reproducible experiment if we had a
laboratory which is what we&#39;ve been
calling for the funding to do but what
Stan Meyer did and this is something I&#39;m
going to go into what had been the
mistakes how can we learn from the last
were the mistakes I&#39;ve made in the last
15 years but the mistakes others have
made in the last 24 so if I were to drop
dead tonight one of the reasons I&#39;m
making this film is I&#39;d like for people
to know have the Ben
fit of what I&#39;ve gone through and what
I&#39;ve learned because it is not obvious
it is not it is very counterintuitive
like most inventors and I&#39;ve never had
this mindset the Stan Meyer felt that
well he can monetize this by keeping it
the little secret formula putting a
patent into the Patent Office but not
putting all the detail in so no one else
could really reproduce it but of course
if you can&#39;t reproduce the technology
from the patent the patent is useless as
you know any talk to any patent attorney
it that&#39;s the whole point of a patent is
to protect it otherwise you keep it a
trade secret like the lists secret
ingredients of coca-cola and what
happened is that he died before he could
really find a way to move it out because
about the time his little invention
became known where even wastewater could
be used to run your house or car doing a
generator just burning hydrogen and
oxygen gas which has zero pollution
because the you have water vapor as the
tailpipe which you can actually put back
into the system and keep using it the
water you&#39;re just pulling out the energy
equivalent of the bonds the atomic bonds
and the way it&#39;s you&#39;re breaking them at
very low power is what I&#39;m going to keep
referring to as this magic sweet spot
high voltage and at very specific
resonant frequencies depending on the
substrate by substrate I mean water
crystalline material air magnetic coils
do you think of those as substrates but
the principle is what you need to
understand it&#39;s very high-voltage
specific resin and we&#39;re not talking 110
or 220 thousands of or millions of volts
at very very specific cycles per second
resonances depend on the material that
opens what&#39;s called a plane teen vector
into the zero point energy field and bow
then you&#39;re gonna hit that sweet spot
you&#39;re gonna go quote overunity meaning
you&#39;re getting more power out than in
but unfortunately Stan Meyer while he
had an authentic system
he had really people said how did he
come across this an accidental empirical
observation which is really the sort of
the springboard of many Sciences an
accidental observation by someone who&#39;s
astute and he worked at a radar plant
and he observed that under certain
frequencies and voltages water just went
it was quite an accidental observation
went Wow
because h2o to hydrogen and one oxygen
you can burn it and when you burn it
there&#39;s no pollution all you have is
water vapor from the result of burning
it so he went Wow so he started
experimenting and his twin brother Steve
helped him eventually develop the circus
now because he wanted to keep this
secret and he did not disperse in an
open source way that technical
information everyone who&#39;s tried to
reproduce and hasn&#39;t been able to
because they haven&#39;t a understood the
concepts very well and then even if they
have they have been approached
eventually and threatened and we&#39;re
going to talk about the suppression and
the threats that go with this kind of
technology which is real and whence he
was developing this he eventually got
discovered that he could use a material
that was a magnetically charged sort of
liquid in a toroid a toroid is a
doughnut like it looks like a okay
and this was an electromagnetic
generator didn&#39;t burn any so called
Browns gas or water turning into
hydrogen and oxygen and this object was
the big secret of his portfolio that we
were trying to acquire a few years ago
five or six years ago those of you who
followed our work the heirs of the Stan
Meyer collection wanted to sell it and
we had a few hundred thousand dollars
but we did have millions so we lost and
it went to a corporation that&#39;s in
Michigan which is all we need to talk
about that has been working on it since
and they are making the identical
mistake that Stan wire made they&#39;re
doing it secretively
I was recently called in a panic by one
of their funders out of the United
Kingdom who stated to me that they had
gotten these systems to operate
including the toroid which means that
you have a solid state basically a solid
state system with some magnetically
charged material in it and they&#39;ll run
your house now that device had a
national security order slapped on it
and most people stand Meir never spoke
of it because he was told if you speak
of this you&#39;re violating the National
Security Act and will seize it and
you&#39;ll be in prison so we knew this from
someone who had worked very very very
closely because this man who&#39;d walk work
closely with Stan Meyer said forget the
car running on water that&#39;s nothing look
for the toroid so when we went there to
the storage facility where all this
stuff was kept it was there and all the
binders and all the inventors books and
all the manual everything was there we
went home
wow we made appeals to the public you
know I&#39;m a doctor and I&#39;m okay I&#39;m doing
okay but I&#39;m not rich enough to just lay
out several million dollars I can&#39;t
write a check like that so we did what
we could but we lost now when Stan Meyer
had this of course he wasn&#39;t prepared to
go mano-a-mano with the national
security state because he was afraid I
mean they made it very clear you&#39;re
going to prison and that&#39;s that or worse
at a certain point after he passed away
that all the stuff as I said went into
storage
so from 1996 to 2009 whenever it was a
few years ago it was just sort of nobody
knew what happened to it then it
surfaced and we we were really trying to
do it the tragedy of today is that in
the last month or so I got this phone
call and I had predicted at the time
that that collection disappear
I said if it&#39;s going to be handled the
way these people are stating they&#39;re
going to handle it which is to do it
secretively trying to corporatize
monetize and privatize this technology
first of all it&#39;s going to take them
several years to get it operational
codes these are traditional engineers
who didn&#39;t understand the physics so
you&#39;ve got to get the right physicists
and engineers on your team or and folks
like myself who&#39;ve seen these things and
labs will talk about this I&#39;ve been to
classified labs where I&#39;ve seen them
operating the second thing is that you
have got to do it cameras rolling
streamed on Ustream sounds crazy doesn&#39;t
it with Silicon Valley you ever buy into
this or Microsoft or Google or Apple no
because everything&#39;s about patents and
secrecy and getting over on your
competitor but if you play that secrecy
game guess who&#39;s going to be watching
everything you&#39;re doing in real time
keystroke by keystroke on every computer
in your lab the National Security Agency
and the national security state the
instant you hit the Eureka moment
they&#39;re coming in with an NSO a national
security order and you&#39;re shut down
that&#39;s what happens and unfortunately
that is what has now happened to this
group out of Michigan where they are
being threatened and they are trying to
relocate their entire lab to a friendly
country so I talked to this man out of
the United Kingdom I won&#39;t say who what
his name is who&#39;s been helping fund it I
mean millions of dollars and I said look
there are no friendly countries you put
this in the Amazon jungle there&#39;s a ISA
stems Raytheon facility there with
security people who&#39;ll come in where are
you gonna go on this planet with this
beyond the reach of the what I call
transnational super state of security
because it is transnational so there&#39;s
there&#39;s this naivete and I&#39;m speaking
now to all you inventors out there and
all you people who live in the world of
inventions and patents and secrecy
there&#39;s no place you can hide and
there&#39;s no place you can run believe me
please believe me when I tell you this
and therefore you must do it openly with
the whole world watching good phrase
from the 60 the whole world&#39;s watching
now 10 years ago you couldn&#39;t have done
that there wasn&#39;t Ustream and yahoo and
whatever a YouTube and all this stuff
now there is so not the bathrooms of the
lab but all the workstations of the lab
real-time streamed on the internet and
invite people to see it someone comes in
with a national security order you
caught them red-handed and then I&#39;m on
all every network I can get on and I&#39;ve
been on almost every network in the
world saying the technologies that would
save the environment get us off oil or
being ruthlessly suppressed by a rogue
group of people who are not being
supervised by the president in the
Congress and without the consent of the
people this is an illegal act and we
need people to help us democracy
