the possibility of a glorious future. While all this
rush of new life thrilled along the veins of
Hindustan, the heart of that life throbbed steadily
on, the fount of the circulating energy, though
the limbs and the organising brain were more
prominent in the eyes of the world. That heart
was H.P.B. Indifferent to the exercise of authority,
careless of external show—even to the shocking of
those tight-fettered by social conventions—willing
to efface herself if thereby her mission might the
better prosper, there she was, the source of the
occult forces which alone could sustain the Theo-
sophical Society. Ready to prove the reality of
those as yet little known powers of Nature, the
effects of which are as marvellous to the cultured
European as are electrical phenomena to the
Central African, she performed experiment after
experiment for the instruction of those who person­
ally sought her. But she steadily vefused to
vulgarise her mission by any kind of general
“performance of phenomena,” which could only
gratify curiosity and serve no useful purpose.
When urged to “ show her powers ” merely to
convince the general crowd, who cared nothing for
Theosophical teaching but only desired to gratify
their idle love of the marvellous : when told that
thus she might win credence and establish her
authority, she merely shrugged her shoulders, and
with the indifference of the trained occultist,
answered that they might believe or not as they
chose ; let them say she was “ a fraud ” •

With many of the Brahmins she came into dire­

of the doctrines which had been jealously preserved
as the treasure of a privileged minority, she struck
them on their tenderest point, their pride in the
possession of knowledge hidden from the vulgar
crowd, their sensitive jealousy lest their holiest
should be profaned. Knowing that she was speak-
ing truth, they often contradicted her in public,
while in private they hotly protested against the
desecration of their sanctuaries. Physically a
subject race, conquered by the material force of
the aggressive West, they retired the more into the
strongholds of their intellectual pride, looking with
unutterable contempt on the foreigner who could
subdue their bodies, but who, in his ignorance of
the secrets of Nature, was but a barbarian in their
haughty eyes. That he should rule in India was
well, since India had forsaken her ancestral wisdom
and was unworthy to be free: but that he should
catch a glimpse of that mental and spiritual realm
of which they were citizens—nay, such intrusion
should be resisted to the last, and the very existence
of such a realm should be kept secret, lest he should

Russian teacher had her knowledge from the Sages
they reverenced, they were unable to deny . but
they resisted her publication of the teachings as
their ancestors had resisted the teachings of
Gautama, the Buddha. Not for the “ common
people” were even the crumbs of the “ Divine
Wisdom
Nevertheless, despite all, her influence steadily
grew, and the Theosophical Society struck its roots
far and wide. Then came the bitter and unscru­
pulous attack of the Christian missionaries in the
famous Coulomb forgeries, forgeries some of them
'O transparent that they could not have deceived an
intelligent child, others ingeniously concocted of the

And here, I venture to say, a mistake was made,
a mistake in tactics as well as a failure in loyalty.
An examination held promptly and on the spot
proved the falsehood of the calumnious accusations,
and exposed the nefarious artifices by which
evidences had been fabricated. So far, so good.
But then, instead of closing up round the assailed
Teacher and defending to the utmost her position
and her honour, the fatal policy was adopted of
attempting to minimise her position in the Society,
of arguing that the teaching remained impregnable
whether the teacher was or was not trustworthy.
It was a policy of expediency, not of principle, it
. . _ wise to ignore attacks rather than to
refute them, and to lay stress on the
strength of the philosophy rather than to^ 1

-sufficiently recovered from almost fatal illness, she
recommenced her work, but in Europe not in India,
confining her activity to the Western World.
The effects of her presence quickly became
manifest. Where was the occult heart, there was
centred the life of the Society, and in the West, on
every side, appeared signs of new vitality. How
the Theosophical movement was spread through
Western lands it needs not here to relate. The
“ Theosophical Activities ” in every number of
Lucifer tell the tale so that he who runs may read.
This rapid growth has been due primarily to
H.P.B.’s personal presence, secondarily to the for­
mation of the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical
Society. iDto this, those only are admitted who
accept H.P.B. as their teacher in Occultism, re­
cognising her as the messenger of that Brotherhood
who are the real Founders of the Theosophical
Society. This Section embraces most of the most
active workers in the Society, and as they base

thoir activity on their philosophy little of it is
wasted in running after false scents. There is a
certain fringe of people who come and go, who
enter from curiosity and are disgusted when they
find only hard work -
, who seek for “ powers ” and
are angry when they find only self-denial; who
enter thinking Occultism an easy and exciting
study, and break under the tension to which they
find themselves subjected. But the centre of the
Section is steadily solidifying, and it encircles
H. P. B. with evergrowing trust—founded on .
lengthening experience—with ever-increasing love,
gratitude and loyalty.
Now touching the position of H.P.B. to and in
the Theosophical Society, the following is a brief
exposition of it, as it appears to many of us :
1. Either she is a messenger from, the Masters, or
else she is a fraud.
From this dilemma there is no escape. If she
does not come from Them, bringing Their message,
doing Their work, executing Their commission, her
whole life is a lie. From beginning to end, she has
claimed nothing as her own, everything as from
Them. Those who are in daily contact with her,
know how she continually refers to Their decision,
speaks in Their name. No third course is open to
us : there are only these alternatives, the mission
is either real or fraudulent.
2. In either case the Theosophical Society would
have had no existence without her.
8
The folly of trying to separate the TheosonV
Society and H. P. B. lies in this fact, w J c,i
H. P. B. no Theosophical Society. All the W
est,.,
who know anything of Theosophy have leam^
from her or from her pupils. Colonel Olcott, as
always recognises, obtained through her his jr
troduction to the work. Save for her, he would b
e
a well-known American Spiritualist, not the
President of the Theosophical Society. So w
ith
Mr. Sinnett, so with Mr. Judge, so with each and
all. Many have obtained independent evidence
afterwards, but for all she has been the portal
through which they have passed into the occult
world. Nor is the fact that the existence of th«
Theosophical Society is due to her the only proof of
the hopelessness of the attempt to rend the twain
apart. For just as it owed to her its inception, so
now it owes to her its vitality. Where she is, there,
evident to all eyes, is the centre of energy: and
where she is not physically, there the progress is in
proportion to the loyalty shewn towards her.
Unfair criticism of her, ungenerous carping at her,
slackness in defending her against attack from out­
side, wherever these are found there also quickly
follow stagnation, decay, death.
3. / / she is a fraud, she is a woman o f w onderful
ability and learning, giving all the credit of these to
some persons who do not exist.
As to the ability and learning, these are not
challenged by her enemies. They sometime <av

that her knowledge is ill-digested, that she arranges
her materials badly, that she is misty, involved, self-
contradictory. But that she possesses an ex­
traordinary fund of varied information, bearing on
out-of-the-way topics and obscure philosophies, is
admitted on every hand. If she be a fraud, why is
she such a fool as to invent imaginary Teachers,
fathering on them her knowledge, and so gaining on
every side abuse and slander, while she might have
gained credit, to say nothing of money, by the
simple and natural course of giving out her own
as her own ? Can anything more insane be imagined
than for a Russian woman of noble family, married
to a high official, to go out into the world on a
wild-goose chase after imaginary Teachers, and
having acquired a mass of recondite knowledge at
great cost and suffering, to throw away all the
credit of acquiring it, to ascribe it to non-existent
persons, to face slander, abuse, calumny, instead of
utilising it in a more common way, to remain an
exile from her own country, to be poor and despised
where she might be wealthy and honoured ? If any­
one can produce, outside Bedlam, a lunatic more
mad than H.P.B. must be if she be a fraud, I should
be grateful for the honour of an introduction.
4 If H.P.B. is a true messenger, opposition toher
is opposition to the Masters, she being Their only
channel to the Western World.

the philosophy, you must accept h e r; accept h

and you cannot stop short of the full proposition a
;
stated above. And here let me make a suggestion
to those who rashly and superficially judge H.P,^
and complain that she is hasty, that she “ shuts
up ” enquirers, that she repels would-be disciples.
H.P.B. varies with the people who come to her. T
o
the person who veils mere curiosity under polite
forms and false courtesy, she will be abrupt, sharp,
repellent. The hostile feeling masked under smiles,
finds itself pierced by keen sarcasm, or knocking
itself against a wall of ice. But to the honest
enquirer she is patient and gentle to a rare extent,
and only her pupils know of a patience that has no
limits, a strength that never falters, an insight that
never errs. In fact, H. P. B. herself is the test of
the members, and when they begin to grumble at
her, they would do wisely to analyse themselves. I
sometimes think of a test dropped into a solution,
precipitating some substance therein contained.
“ What a horrid liquid it must be so to dirty
that beautifully clear fluid,” cry the ignorant.
If the substance had not been present it
would not have been precipitated by the test
and if enquirers and members are honest, they
will find themselves attracted, not repel] ei
by H.P.B.

This is the conclusion of the whole matter, the
decision on which we must guide our policy. I see
on some sides a disposition to temporise, to whittle
away the Esoteric Teachings, to hastily twist them
into accord with temporary hypotheses of Science,
in order to gain a momentary advantage, perchance
a fuller hearing. This is not wise. Already some
such hypotheses, opposed to occult teachings, have
been thrown aside by more advanced scientific
thought, and have been replaced by other hypo­
theses, more nearly approaching the occult
views. There is no need to hurry, nor to try
to pour the archaic doctrines into new bottles,
ere those bottles have been tested. The Secret
Teachings have stood many thousands of years,
and have been the source from which the stream of
progress has flowed. They can venture to stand on
their own basis for a few years more, till Science
crosses the dividing line it is tentatively approaching
with each new discovery.
To the members of the Theosophical Society, I
venture to say a word of pleading. But a few years
stretch before us ere the century expires, a century
whose close coincides well-nigh with the close of a
COM*
cycle. As the sands of those years are runn
through the hour-glass of Time, our opportuni%
are running with them; it is “ a race again,
time,” in a very real sense. If the members c
a
r*
at all for the future of the Society, if they wishto
know that the Twentieth Century will see it
standing high above the strife of parties, a beacon-
light in the darkness for the guiding of men, ifthey
believe in the Teacher who founded it for hum
an
service, let them now arouse themselves from
slothful indifference, sternly silence all dissensions
over petty follies in their ranks, and march shoulder
to shoulder for the achievement of the heavy task
laid upon their strength and courage. If Theosophy
is worth anything, it is worth living for and worth
dying for. If it is worth nothing let it go at once
and for all. It is not a thing to play with, it is not
a thing to trifle with. Ere 1891 sees its earliest
dawning, ere 1890 falls into the grave now a-
digging for it, let each Theosophist, and above all
let each Occultist, calmly review his position,
carefully make his choice, and if that choice be for
Theosophy, let him sternly determine that neither
open foes nor treacherous friends shall shake his
loyalty for all time to come to his great Cause and
Leader, which twain are one.

COMMENTS ON “THE
THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
AND H. P. B.”
[I gladly give room to the protest which follows. It is
w
ise and timely, and may. perhaps, ward off worse than
"petty criticisms of H. P. B.” Needless to say that
M
rs. Besant’s article would not have appeared had I seen
it before publication. But I may point out to Mr. Patter­
sonthat much of his protest, however true, is not exactly
aimed at what Mrs. Besant wrote. She did not say that
the T. S. taught any particular doctrines, but merely
expressed her own view that the position of one who
belonged to the T. S. and ungenerously carped at the
pioneer who founded it was illogical. This is clearly a
matter of opinion, and Mr. Patterson puts the opposing
view. One has but to read the new “ Constitution and
Rules of the Theosophical Society ” for 1891 (in the
Supplement of the January Theosophist), to find in
Article xiii, 2, that “ no Fellow, Officer, or Council of the
Theosophical Society, or of any Section or Branch thereof,
shall promulgate or maintain any doctrine as being that
advanced or advocated by the Society ” ; and, whatever
we do, we have to abide by the Rules of the T. S.
Mrs. Besant would have done more wisely to have called
her article “ Comments on the E. S. of the Theosophical
Society and H. P. B .,” she would then have been on the
safe side; for a member of the E. S. who receives
instructions emanating from the Masters of the Occult
Philnsonhv and doubts at the same time the genuineness
of the source, or the honesty of the humble transmitter of
or me so doctrines— liesto own soul, and is
Untrue to Ms pledge. He cannot be honest and remain in
the E. S., in such a case. But then, the Esoterio q
its qualification “ of the T. S.” notwithstanding,
represent the latter, and in future it will drop the^S
tional words altogether. From the very beginnin •
second rule stated, that the “ Esoteric SectionhaP'
official or corporate connection with the Exote?
Society ” (see Lucifer of October, 1888). Henceforthh
will be called “ the Eastern School of Theosophy’
’
simply. Meanwhile, I thank our brother, Mr. Patter,
son, for giving me this opportunity of expressing m
feelings—H. P. B.]
IN the December number of Lucifer in an article
entitled “ The Theosophical Society and H. P. B.”
there are the following statements :
“ The following article expresses the views of
many members of the Theosophical Society who
feel strongly that it is time that some protest should
be made against the constant petty criticisms
levelled at H. P. B. As co-editor I put in this article,
which has not been submitted to H. P. B., nor will
she see it until the magazine is issued ; so she is
in no sense responsible for its appearance. A-^NIE
B e sa n t .
“ Now touching the position of H. P. B., to and
in the Theosophical Society, the following is a
brief exposition of it as it appears to many of us:
“ 1. Either she is a messenger from the Masters,
or else she is a fraud.
“ 2. In either case the Theosophical Society
would have no existence without her.
“ 3. If she is a fraud she is a woman of wonder­
ful ability and learning, giving all the credit of
these to some persons who do not exist.

anything it is worth living for and worth dying
for. If it is worth nothing, let it go at once and
for all.”
On these last grounds let us stand. If it is worth
anything it is worth living for and dying for ; and
worth working for and worth writing for, and
worth taking some risks for; and at the risk of
incurring misunderstanding, and at the risk o
hurting the feelings of those whose feelings should

seem as though its author, through her impe/^
kindness and loyalty, had allowed her judging*
be partially influenced by her feelings. ^
although there are few Theosophists who vq\\
disagree with her in most of her issues, yet there
seems to be a little grain of erroneous opinion^
them from which a large and poisonous growth may
spring. If this is so, it is only true brotherliness
to point it out. It lies first in the statement that
u If there are no Masters the Theosophical Society
is an absurdity and there is no use of keeping it
up.” And again in another statement which
says: “ Once accept the philosophy you must
accept her (H.P.B.).” May not much harm be
done by the holding up of such views ? May they
not tend to keep many out who would be
benefited by being in ; and for whom the Society
was largely founded ? Are not the statements in
their nature somewhat dogmatic? Have we not
still in our natures some of that intolerance which,
forcing rather than leading, persecuted in the name
of righteousness ? For there are subtle transfor­
mations possible in our characters, which will
bring the old faults out in new guises, and
we are none, not one, quite free from intoler­
ance. The churches have creeds ; but applicants
for admission are usually given to understand
that they need not be fully accepted ; and the

ft.P.B. are working against the development of
them. If this Theosophical movement is to be
carried on successfully through the three or four
generations of the first seventy-five years of the
coming century, we must be very heedful. What
do the Constitution and the by-laws of the Society,
what does the application for admission into it tell
us? Not one word as to belief. They simply con­
tain provisions which tend to guarantee liberty and
cultivate tolerance. Is it not contrary to their
spirit to say: “ Once accept the philosophy you
must accept her ” ? Accept what philosophy ? The
Society has none. Not long since an earnest student
searching for Truth, but not one of our members,
asked if we were not Jesuitical. Was her position
not well taken ? It was, if we as a Society have a
philosophy. We constantly cry out we have no
creeds, no dogmas, no beliefs, and we almost as
constantly, or at any rate very frequently, uninten­
tionally give the lie to this.
And why speak of the Society as an absurdity
without Masters ? Are its objects, especially the

and it in perhaps thin good which tho Marion
seeking, rathor than tho acceptance of any*pij)
Sophy, or any recognition of themselvesd
Evon a recognised authoritative leader mayfa
dangerous. H. P. B. herself is always inculcating
self-reliance, and discouraging any dependence upon
others, herself included. She understands that the
true alchemist seeks to havo men throw their
opinions into one common melting-pot, knowing
that they will take out all of the Truth which
they put in, and some of their errors transmuted.
It is the real change of base metals into
gold.
If the-Society has an authoritative leader, beliefs
will be accepted simply on authority, and a belief
thus accepted is almost of necessity perverted.
Look at the doctrines of Karma and Reincarnation.
Many regard it as quite heterodox not to accept
them; and yet the first is often made a fetish of,
and both are by many crudely understood ; the one
often being looked at in a way to make of it a
positive fatalism, the other a kind of personal
resurrection. This comes from reliance upon cer­
tain persons or books accepted as authority. Such
reliance is against the presumable wish of the
Masters. We must seize on our own truth and
digest it ourselves : and if we do we cannot so
pervert it.

of course, unwise. There may be a hidden enemy

us set up no unnecessary barriers, and let us wait

thus best serve, thus best defend. This is not a
policy of silence ; it does not prevent our using pen

it should prevent our making belief in her a

°]ap the face of anyone who may speak disrespect­
fully of H.P.B., we will not help her reputation but
rather strengthen the calumniator in his attitude.
O
ur line of defence cannot be well chosen if it does
harm. And it will do harm if made in such a way
as to make a belief in any person or philosophy a
criterion of good standing. Let us stand shoulder
to shoulder; let us strengthen those ties which we
areforming for this and the coming incarnations ; let
us by all means be grateful to her from whom so
much has come to us and the rest of humanity,
but let us for the sake of others be judicious. Let
us make disbelievers in H.P.B., disbelievers in
karma, disbelievers in Reincarnation, disbelievers
in the Masters as welcome, or more welcome, into
the Society than others, provided always they wish
to form the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood.
All this is said earnestly and sincerely, but
with some trepidation, the higher plane of care­
lessness not having been attained, and indifference
to others’ opinions not having been acquired. But
when so prominent a member of our Society as the
author of “ The Theosophical Society and H.P.B.”
propounds w hat appears to some of us dangerous
doctrine, we have no right to be silent.

PERSO N A LLY , I should have been content to have
left Brother Patterson’s “ comments ” unanswered,
for when both sides have had their say on any
matter of controversy, the outside public is a better
judge of the merits of the question than either of
the disputants can be. But it is thought better
that I should point out some misconceptions of my
critic, lest my silence should seem to assent to
them, even though H. P . B. ha3 already noted that
much of Mr. Patterson’s protest “ is not exactly
aimed at what Mrs. Besant wrote”.

LET me say at the outset of my “ re-comments
that I thoroughly and heartily endorse, as must
every F.T.S., the statement of Mr. Patterson that
the i heosophical Society has no creeds ”, This
is indeed a truism rather than a truth, since the
Constitution of the Society so decrees, and since
anyone who accepts the first object has right of
entrance. By all means “ let us make disbelievers
in H. P. B., disbelievers in Karma, d isb elievers in

has often pointed out, it is not necessary to become
a Theosophist in order to enter the Theosophical
Society. It is not I who would shut out dis­
believers in H. P. B. if they want to come in ; but
what puzzles me is why they shovld want to come in.
Enquirers may rationally enter; people whose
judgment is in suspension until they have acquired
fuller information, and who hope to obtain that
information in the Society ; seekers after truth,
who join in order to prosecute their search under
conditions which appear to be favourable. All
these classes of people may become members of the
i. S. on intelligible grounds without belief in
H. P. B. or in the Masters : a person who regards
H. P. B. as a fraud has an equal right to join, but
1 frankly say that his action is, to me, unintelligible
and illogical. Que diable va-t-il faire dans cette
galere ?
But where Mr. Patterson seems to me to misread
my article and to be rather misty in his own views,
is in his apparent idea that the object of the
“ Theosophical movement ” is merely to get people
into the Theosophical Society, without the least
regard to what they do when they are in. What
“ movement” can there be of any utility to the
world, which does not tend towards some recognised
goal ?’Granted that the honest materialist and his

positions.
Mr. Patterson passes by without comment my

0hdZ l “ Either she is a messenger from the
illr s T o r else she is a fraud." Yet everything
tarns on this, and the issue cannot be evaded. In
tliBfirst case, it will not be said that I have put
the argument too strongly. In the second, the
magnitude of her fraud is undeniable : and in that
case what honourable man or woman can condone
that fraud and assist in maintaining it by remaining
in a Society in which she holds an official position ?
For this is no question of merely accepting or.
not accepting a philosophy. A certain definite
philosophy has been put forward by Madame.
Blavatsky; I grant that, legally and technical­
ly. the philosophy is not the philosophy of the
Society, and that “ the Society has none”.
But she is distinctly committed to it, and either
holds it in good faith from Those from whom
she says she received it, or is palming off on
the world a shameless deceit. The Society, by
accepting her as one of its Founders, by recognis­
ing her as one of its two chief officials, and lately
into the ! in its Convention, through its appointed delegates,
east to announcing to the world by formal vote its confi­
dence in her, makes itself a party to the fraud, if
fraud there be. If, under these circumstances, a
person believing her to be a deceiver, likes to join
the Society, there is nothing in the Rules to keep
, . . but persons of ordinary morality, to

Hierarchy of Initiates, of Masters in whose
hands rests the sacred charge of the garnered
Esoteric Knowledge of all Time. Most certain­
ly they are not “ seeking . . . recogni­
tion of themselves What to Them could import
our recognition ? They seek but the good of the
race, but the elevation of Humanity. But it may
be our wisdom to yield that which They do not ask,
for the good of the race lies in approaching its
highest children, and in following the way marked
by the sacred feet of those who have trodden the
Path.
How could the Hidden Wisdom be preserved in
the absence of such a Brotherhood ? How could it
be handed down from generation to generation if
there were none who learned it, none who verified
it, none who increased it, none who transmitted it
*° their trained successors ? And if there be no
Hidden Wisdom, what is the raison d'&tre of the
fheosophical Society ? Some of us have looked to it
with yearning hope that it will save the world from
the deluge of materiality ; we have joined it with
the one idea of strengthening the struggling spirit­
uality which alone can prevent the perishing of
civilisation in a whirlpool of class strife and terrible
hatreds, and preserve the nations from the horrors
of a universal internecine war. If this hope be
vain, we have nothing left to look to. Theosophy
is our last chance, our last stake. If the Theo-
hical Society is not founded for the propagation
SOI
of Theosophy, I for one, feel no h,U,m
future. What force has its declaration
hood, on what foundation is its belief fa \„,r
hood laid ? Surely on that unity of //,-*,
which is the central truth of Thwwr,ft/
that spiritual oneness which, accord) to '/.*
sophy, makes of Man one indivisible whale,
away this, and the first object is without r,p
and with the baselessness of its main ofrjsct,(>
one enforced obligation, how shall the Thw/top;,/,*
Society stand? Granted that the Thew/phM
Society has no creed, and teaches no doctri;^
none the less is it without foundation unless it U
built on the rock of the Hidden Wisdom. By tJ
means open its door wide that all may enter :
but let no Theosophist deny that it is built on tu
sure basis of the Esoteric Doctrine, and that it*
brotherhood is founded on the oneness of man?
spiritual nature, that nature which exists aIks
in those who affirm and in those who deny.
Welcome into the sacred circle with brotherly
greeting those who reject the *
*Holy Spirit
of Man,” but never let them for one moment
doubt that the very core of that welcome is the
Theosophical belief in the presence in them of that
Spirit which they are unable to discern.
With regard to the policy adopted in connection
with the Coulomb slanders, the event has proved its
unwisdom. Where members have shrunk from the
defence of their Teacher, the Society has languished ;

!lort, we all know, and her notes to Mr. Patter­
n ’s article sufficiently re-prove it, if fresh proof
benecessary. But, as an Esotericist writes to me :
“An attitude of mind towards her work which in
H.P.B. is right and perfect, is not necessarily so in
her disciples, however generous she may be in
making it appear so.” After all, was it not just
because the exoteric Society was weak, uncertain,
and wavering in its allegiance, that the E.S. was
formed, so that the necessary work might be done ?
It is doubtless true that I look at all these matters
from the Esoteric standpoint, and knowing how
great the loss of the half-hearted, I am over-eager
to show them “ the things that belong to their
peace ere they are hidden from their eyes by the
century’s closing years, lest to them, as to others
long centuries ago, the whisper shall come across
the waves when it is all too late: “ Ye would
not come . . . that ye might have life ”,
Bitter will be the struggle in the twentieth
century between the dying materiality and
the growing spirituality of the world, and
it lies in our hands to-day to strengthen the forces
which then shall work for good. And so I plead
to all Theosophists that, while opening wide to all
who seek the gateway of the Theosophical Society,
they who have insight will speak out in no faltering
J ,, . +hev who halt between two opinions
tones ; that tney
shall be helped to make their choice ; and that
timed hesitation, no half-hearted allegiance
put stumbling-blocks in the way of those who',
wise might walk in safety, or m ake our
brothers suppose th a t their blindness
