 The members of the Guild of Spiritual Healing, or The Seekers, as it later became, who published this journal met in Harmony Prayer Circles to obtain healing from "Dr. Lascelles" and other healing spirits.  Their leader was the Rev. C.A. Simpson, who wrote regularly for the journal.  This was an undistinguished product of British spiritualism between the wars, with notable contributions or excerpts from C.E.M. Joad, Lewis Spence, Harry Price and others, including Dr. Lascelles, who wrote on topics like "The Science of True Prayer," and "Pacifist Angels."  University of Texas, Austin.
