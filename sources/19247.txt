what I&#39;m wanting to share with this
first present part of the presentation
or where all the pitfalls because
invariably if you assert these
technologies are possible any thinking
person is going to say why aren&#39;t they
out there I&#39;m trying to provide you with
the why okay
and also the hell now you get to our
humble efforts and if you want to know
more about the work of T Townsend Brown
and Tesla and many many many others that
they&#39;re on our website and I&#39;m not going
to go through things that you can read
there I want to share things that from
our experience that is unique to the
access we&#39;ve had and the experience
we&#39;ve had which is as they would say
unique and once in a generation
opportunity so some years ago many years
ago I met a man who&#39;s a senior scientist
at the naval research labs down here if
you fly into National Airport hilda&#39;s
radar domes
it&#39;s the largest Department of Defense
lab in the United States and very senior
scientists I like very you know puts
together stuff for the vice-president
Paseo stuff for Admirals and joint staff
and what-have-you and I suspect if his
name was known he&#39;d be the most famous
aerospace designer of the last 30 years
but everything he&#39;s built has been for
three-letter agencies CIA and elsewhere
so he has been very very interested in
supportive of what we&#39;re doing he endure
stands the implications of the secrecy
the dark part and so a few years ago we
have if you see on our website the Orion
project which was a sort of a group that
we put together we wanted to raise the
funds to have our own lab didn&#39;t get
enough funds so what we ended up doing
is providing grants to people some of
them were people who said they could do
things they really couldn&#39;t but you you
know hey you don&#39;t know it&#39;s we we&#39;re in
that world emergency here as I
see it so we were saying like we just
we&#39;re not going to sword this and said I
let&#39;s put it out there but one of the
grants went to this brilliant writ large
engineer who had studied under William s
bender at the University of Washington a
true genius who in the 1970s had founded
after his studies transdimensional
technologies a company that was working
on these and he actually did make a
generator energy generating device I
think it was 74 somewhere around there
and that device ended up getting seized
by a national security order and he
describes as if it was yesterday these
thugs in suits with an all-access pass
badge coming in with a national security
order and they said you are now working
for us and that technology goes into
what&#39;s called the vault and all your
papers go into the vault and you really
don&#39;t have a choice so for the last 40
years he&#39;s worked for the national
security state through a corporation
that I know and there&#39;s no the details I
don&#39;t want to go into for for privacy
reasons and he basically does stuff for
various agencies through this
corporation and he was introduced to me
by this senior scientist as a naval
research labs and says you know what
this gentleman&#39;s Sheppard&#39;s as they&#39;re
called in the intelligence community
Shepherds meaning the people who are
holding your security clearances and
sort of looking out for what you&#39;re
doing and he had five of them have
approved him working with you dr. Greer
and the Orion project and to do a basic
prototype Tesla type prototype but he is
not allowed to do anything that flies
because when I had gone down to his lab
and I did I went down to Huntsville and
near the Redstone Arsenal and saw the
lab the that this gentleman had things
that were floating
around nothing attached to them look
like miniature UFOs pretty cool stuff
then they were research labs spent 1
million dollars beefing that up and had
things in their hangars floating around
and I&#39;ve been in the NRL because I
people just bring me there they want me
to come in and share what I know and
I&#39;ll pick their brains and they&#39;ll pick
mine and I do not hold a security
clearance but I know I will not accept
one I tell people what I&#39;m doing and we
don&#39;t want a security clearance so what
happens is that this guy says look I&#39;ll
do this for you in my spare time because
he&#39;s still working full-time for this
corporation doing stuff for the agency
and other entities I said great here&#39;s I
forget what we gave him 60 70 thousand
dollars and about the time he was
getting that thing build up a team was
sent down from the DC area to him met
with him in his skiff which is a secure
communication intelligence facility s CI
a-- basically it&#39;s an underground
electronic electromagnetic sealed
facility and in his skiff there was a
former CIA director who had left the CIA
and took a golden parachute into one of
the big beltway bandit corporations here
in the DC area and another team of
people that basically threatened him
provided all kinds of false and defaming
information about me that was outrageous
I mean things like I&#39;m teaching people
how to use consciousness to detonate
weapons of mass destruction for al-qaeda
I mean just insane stuff I mean you
cannot imagine the full-court press a
defamation that attends trying to do
something like what I&#39;m doing and
basically he got hold of us and said I
can&#39;t do this I&#39;m out here trying to do
this at my heart house in my own private
lab he had a secure lab that had a
top-secret clearance in his house but he
also had this other facility but he says
I mean my immediate intelligence
Shepherd said I could do this but these
guys have come in and have really
threatened us and I&#39;m shut down so we
lost our money and didn&#39;t get anything
so we have done that to the tune of
around nine hundred and fifty thousand
dollars over the last decade and all the
work I&#39;ve done on my family my
associates have all worked pro bono
we&#39;ve never been paid and what we have
learned from it or some very very hard
lessons that anyone listening to this
needs to take to heart because there&#39;s a
there is a very narrow pathway out of
the morass we&#39;re in and because we tried
the others we&#39;ve tried providing grants
to people we tried funding people who
were not just you know someone in a
trailer park who had a wild idea I mean
these were people with the proven aunts
their credentials we visited later on
all over the world now we have been
caught in some outrageous scams and I
want to talk about some of those because
the public has an idea that because you
put something on YouTube that&#39;s this
positive proof it is not it&#39;s sort of
like my father-in-law used to say paper
does not refuse ink if you want to just
make something up YouTube doesn&#39;t refuse
an upload of a video nor does internet
refuse digits you just put it out there
so it&#39;s a non-selective filter anything
is up there and a two-dimensional
viewing on a YouTube is not a 3d proof
that it is for real and that it&#39;s
reproducible so independent scientific
validation and reproducibility these are
the cynical unknown of science and so we
want to do this scientifically and very
very rationally I won&#39;t give you an
example in a latin-american country but
they went down to Mexico City few years
ago and they had a device small and it
was in case than in resin or plastic and
you put it between say a fan and a wall
socket and you would with
in there you&#39;d measure how it was a
kilowatt you running his fan a kilowatt
of electricity with it in there it was
only using a hundred watts and it was
supposedly saving all this power because
it had a secret circuit in there that
was pulling energy in from the
zero-point field that was solid-state I
said well it&#39;s theoretically possible so
i schlepped down there look at it bring
one back we&#39;re testing it sure enough
and it turns out the Southwest Research
Institute which is a very big testing
entity in Austin that a lot of
mainstream entity shoes tested it and
gave the same report and they had that
report so it looked like well it had
passed muster here but big but b ut
nobody knew what was in the little
plastic thing it was sealed and it was a
trade secret and I went uh
this is risky because it may be a trick
so Eugene mallove who is an MIT PhD MIT
Harvard who is on our team who was
murdered as many of you know a few years
ago and some other scientists including
these folks at NRL and some other
facilities tested this magical power
saving device and they said well sure
enough they&#39;re not lying about it looks
like if you just measure the energy when
we did an MRI scan on it you know what
we found it had a circuit that was
tricking the meter and making the reader
run backwards which can be done it&#39;s
called the power phase angle any
engineers in here and so very clever
multi-million dollar scam that had taken
him and all it was doing was tricking
the power it was still using the same
amount of power
it took untold thousands of dollars and
that was including everyone working for
free all these entities Eugene mallove
my scientific team everything to get to
the bottom of this and that is why we
will not pursue anything that is not
open
transparent and completely if they&#39;re
not willing to open their kimono fully
we&#39;ll say you keep it and let someone
else eat that snake oil ain&#39;t gonna be
us now I hate to be so blunt but this is
this is where you&#39;ve really got to
understand what we&#39;ve been through now
you take that one example and we&#39;ve done
that several dozen times all over the
world at enormous cost to myself
enormous travel expenses all kind and in
many times were people demand to have X
amount put up as a retainer and dah dah
dah dah dah dah dah for you would even
carry one away and it&#39;s ended up to be
this kind of a fraud no this sounds like
a real downer doesn&#39;t it and it is but
if you don&#39;t learn from these things
you&#39;re going to repeat them which we
will never do
