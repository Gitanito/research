  		              		Experience Description   

    I was suffering from depression and andgry with God.  I felt like God had abandoned me because I had barely survived the abuse in the recent past.  I thought my life was hell and nothing could be worse.  My doctor had given me pills for my back pain. One night I drove to a quiet part of town and took all of the pills. My body became very cold and the pain inside me kept getting worse. It was horrible and my strength was slipping away as my breathing became harder and harder. I was slumped in the car seat and I knew I was dying. 
  
  I was suddenly very afraid, so I cried out to Jesus Christ with the last of my strength. Then my last breath slipped out and I was pulled out of my body and instantly into a black void. My spirit body was floating in the darkness and it was a lonely place. It felt like someone came up behind me with scissors and cut the cord connection to my body. I knew I was dead and couldn't go back. My thoughts were very fast, like lightning, and my mind was so clear and sharp. My senses were all heightened and my emotions felt more intense. For a long time I was alone in this darkness. 

  Then a speck of light became visible in the distance. I tried to move toward it.  It didn't work because I was floating.  So then I tried to fly or direct my floating towards the light, but my progress wasn't very good. The light came to me in a zigzag, erratic pattern and at great speed. It was at that moment that I realized the light was a Being. The Being of light was pure white and about 8 to 9 feet tall.  I had a peaceful, loving feeling being in this Being's beautiful presence. I believe that Being was an angel. However, I felt like the Being was waiting for something. In my thoughts, I was thinking about how angry I was with God.  I was not repentant for my self-murder. The Being of light left me in a flash. 

  I then felt like a blanket of fear fell on top of me.  Never have I felt fear like that, and I have survived a number of murder attempts on my life. The terror gripped me. Then I felt a ice-cold burning sensation, like I was standing on top of Mount Everest. I have always hated the cold and I felt the extremely intense, burning ice. Then I felt big, long needles like the length of a knitting needle but sharp at the tip.  The needles were being stabbed into every square inch of my body at the same time. Then the needles were ripped out, all at the same time and then stabbed back in. This was repeated over and over again.  It never stopped. I heard screaming and realized it was my scream. I felt like there was a continual pulse of lightning from the tip of my skull to the bottom of my feet. The pain in that place of darkness was worse than anything I had ever felt on earth. It was hundreds or possibly thousands of times worse than what we feel on earth, as the spirit body is so very sensitive. 

  I was thinking about my life and my loved ones and how desperately I wanted for them to avoid this hellish place. I started screaming in my mind, 'I can't take it anymore! I am going crazy in this place let me out!!! Let me out!!!' then I heard what can only be described as demonic laughter that came from a Being right next to me. It was the most evil sound I have ever heard. The darkness was so complete and I could not see a thing. Then in a flash I was returned to my body. 

  My body had changed and felt like stone. Nothing would move and everything was solid, rock hard. I was taking the tiniest breaths through my nose. I focused on my big toe on my right foot and kept telling it to move. It took a very long time, but  eventually it did a tiny wiggle. It took what I am guessing a couple hours before I could move my body enough to drive very slowly home in the early morning. I still did not have proper motor function and was extremely weak. I crawled out of the car and up the stairs.  I got into my house and vomited up the pills taken earlier. My terror of dying again was very real in my mind. I refused to go to hospital as I was afraid they would lock me in a padded room and drug me up.  I certainly couldn't tell them what I experienced or they would call me crazy. I did my best to repress the memory. 

In my heart I knew with all my being that God is real and that Jesus heard my call before death. 'And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’ [Acts 2v21 New King James Version] Jesus heard my cry before death and he released me from a place that I can only describe as hell or the outer darkness referred to in Matthew 25v30 (NKJV), 'And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 

  This is my second chance at life. Thank you for reading my testimony. God bless you all.

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Uncertain I think just a split-second before entering the void a flash image of my body slumped in car from above the car came to me. It happened so fast that I'm not really sure.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   Heightened sense of touch. I felt like the light in the darkness was a long way from me but I could see it clearly. I have terrible eyesight in real life can't see anything at a distance. I felt like a super version of myself and improved/ upgraded version but in spirit form. The most notable thing was my mind was lightning fast and clear no fogginess or memory loss.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I was first brought into the void. My being was very aware/sensitive the whole time though.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     Time felt like it was passing very fast, I remember thinking I felt like I had been there for hundreds of years.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Exceptional. Normally, I have terrible eyesight. I wear glasses and they never seem to be strong enough.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Enhanced very clear in the spirit. I am partially deaf in physical body.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   It was a Being of light or an angel. It was all made of the whitest, white lightand  about 8 to 9 feet tall. I could not make out a head or arms etc. It was a Being because of the way it moved and the emotion that I sensed from it. It moved in a zigzag,  came up right in front of me, and stopped. I was outside the Being's light.  
  
  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     It was a black void like being dropped in space where there are no stars. Nothingness. Alone.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Joy/safety/Happiness at being with the Being of light, that I call an angel. I felt utter fear and abject terror in torment. I was petrified during the demonic laughter.

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I understood that I was a selfish person and I had done a terrible thing to kill myself. I realized the people we love are what really matter in our lives. Money and wealth have no meaning when your memories are running through your head the only thing that has value is the relationships you had. I realized I should have said 'I love you' more often to my family.  

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     I clearly remembered my life as it was flashing through my mind like lightning. Really, the only thing that mattered was my loved ones, such as how much I missed them and my utter terror they would come to this place or darkness/ torment. It wasn't so much visual as it was more memories and thoughts rather than images of my past.  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   I was shouting in my mind and with all my will,  'I want to get out!'   I sensed the laughing demonic Male got a shock that I was gone so quick. I think Jesus took pity on me at that point and yanked me out. I had learned my lessons -  Don't send yourself to torment .and we die when it is our appointed time.
  
God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I am more spiritual. A stronger Christian.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.      I was not sure why I wasn't dropped into a burning lake of fire. When I found myself in the darkness, then I remembered hearing others talk about a dark tunnel,  a light at the end of the tunnel, and go to the light. My Being was not in a tunnel, however. I was in a void. The light in the distance was not an entry point into heaven,  it was a Being coming to me instead. I did enter torment but I could not see the tormentors in the dark. The Being of light was not clearly an angel or Jesus but it was a pure Being of light and could be either one. It reminded me of John 8v12 (NKJV)Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     That people matter more than I had realized.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I heard demonic laughter when I was desperate to get out of that place of torture. It was pure evil, like a male witch's sick laugh x1000. 

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain.   Maybe the Being of light was Jesus? I don't know. I know that I called out in His name in desperation and I was brought back to life without assistance.  Jesus raised a number of people from the dead and He himself was witnessed as being raised from the dead by over 500 people at one time.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No.     I was in a place of separation. At the beginning, it was just me and a whole lot of boring darkness.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     The Being or light/ Angel/ potentially Jesus. It was a pure Being that was aware and conscious. I could feel the emotions that flowed from it. I talked to it with my mind. It didn't seem to reply. Although, I was sure it understood me.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     The relationships we have on earth matter. When I had memories of my life on earth going through my head, people are all that matters entirely. It mattered how much I loved them. I also learned to  be less selfish.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I felt like my spirit body was eternal. It was also an upgraded version of this physical body.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I regretted not being more loving and not saying 'I love you' more to my family.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I started reading my bible more and started giving more money away to help others. Eventually, I went back to Church and got baptized. Since the death, I have had spiritual encounters on earth that only strengthens my faith in Jesus Christ.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am a more caring, kinder person.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The Being of light angel was so beautiful and the presence of it was so special and  pure. Words fail to describe the beauty of the light Being. I wanted to stay with the Being forever and felt that I would be happy and safe as long as it was with me.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I cannot forget it. It haunts me every night when the night is at its darkest. I like to have my light on as long as possible at night.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Time I spent watching the Being of light come to me and the time it was with me. It was so perfect. I wanted time to stop and for things to stay that way forever.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It was 4 years before I shared it. I would say that about 50% of the people shunned me.,25% pitied me, and 25% responded in a kind, loving way.  I think it has given them something to think about. Not sure if it has influenced anyone.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   A great uncle who was an old man died of illness in hospital. He was a Christian. He sat back up after 20 minutes of being declared dead. His nurse was the first to see him and she was screaming her head off. He told everyone he went to heaven,  met Jesus and asked to come back to tell more people about him. I had also heard of people saying they were in a tunnel and there was a light at the end of the tunnel. I assumed the light led to heaven.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was amazing to meet the Being of light. There was  also  plenty of terror in that experience that  I did not want to remember. The experience made my faith stronger and I became a better person. i am more caring,  kind, and giving. I am more passionate for Jesus.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I believe that my experience proves the bible. I was in a place of outer darkness and I was in horrible pain. I met a heavenly Being. In my opinion, the cry in Jesus name  is the only reason why I came back.  He saved me from death. No one did CPR. God brought me back Himself.  

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes.    I was praying in my room with the windows shut and door shut.  I felt a peaceful presence enter the room. A  piece of paper on the box across from me started floating around the room.  I thought it was an angel in the room with me. The air smelled like very rich and heady scents like cinnamon and cardamom. It was definitely a heavenly, spiritual encounter.  

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         After coming back, I started to learn about demonic entities. I found a self-deliverance prayer and prayed it once a night for seven days. I felt a heaviness lift off me. I felt like it was easier to be happy and carefree. I do believe in demons after my encounter.
