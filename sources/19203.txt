my name is dawn Bachmann I was trained
by the US Army as a larger area
technician electronics technician I
worked on nike hercules batteries for
two and a quarter years in europe in the
late 60s I was also trained as a systems
analyst to analyze and to troubleshoot
and fix any problems that would occur in
the launcher area also worked in I of C
which is integrated fire control on that
site for about seven months I was on
site work where Honeywell here in
Seattle for two years making nuclear tip
torpedo smart Corky toes their
technicians and operators dealing with
the really high speed very mobile
targets because what they&#39;re looking at
in the IFC are basically electronic
representations of what the radar is
tracking so I heard a number of those
from young operators and older operators
also and they were positioned they were
stationed to different places around the
world
integrative fire control is where the
radars are stationed in relation to the
missiles and it&#39;s a whole bunch of
radars is a high par there&#39;s low-power
target tracking and missile tracking and
they would they would recount stories
where vehicles would come would come in
to the high par and they would track
them and pass them off and they would be
going say 700 miles an hour and
accelerate to 3,500 miles an hour in the
atmosphere quite rapidly I mean just you
know they&#39;re just it was off the scale
in terms of what the technology for our
are or or potential targets Russian
targets were it was off the scale they
are trained to determine the difference
between radar strikes and any
atmospheric disturbances that can
approximate targets they&#39;re there
they&#39;re experts at it so they when they
were tracking targets they were tracking
for physical objects in the atmosphere
there they were a hundred percent
convinced that there were physical
targets that were in the atmosphere and
were involved in a variety of different
types of travel that was in the late 60s
that I was hearing reports the refer the
reports went back into the 50s because a
lot of the older operators had been on
her on Ajax sites Nike Ajax sites and
they were tracking them and primarily
the reports that I got were from the
United States they were in the United
States the military official position is
completely opposite of what people who
operate very sophisticated radar systems
routinely perceive if there wasn&#39;t a
large event they would give you specific
orders to not disclose to anybody ever
and one evening I was sitting in my
living room and it was in October of
1978 and I had all lights off and I was
just sitting there just letting my mind
wander and quite abruptly all of a
sudden four lights four amber lights
started shining in the room and filling
it with diffuse amber light needs to say
I turned around quite rapidly to
determine what it was that I was seeing
and there were three lights that were
approximately equidistant from each
other and a fourth one off of the
equidistant spacing a little bit but in
the same plane anyway after I saw this
object this jet came from the West due
west and I&#39;m very well oriented while I
was standing on the back porch from my
house and attack and fired a missile and
air defense missile as it turned out it
was a high-explosive missile right at
the at the target and and one of the
things that I was doing outside of
observing it is trying to ascertain
approximately how far it was away from
me well as soon as the jet launched the
missile because my experience in air
defense and I know that we have air to
air to air missiles that have nuclear
warheads I ducked behind
back porch so I wouldn&#39;t get blasted
with the alpha beta particles so they
blind Union Bernie horribly and a duck
behind it waited for a period of time
there was no nuclear explosion so I went
so I could view the object again
shrapnel was falling to the ground was
that it had exploded and the object was
accelerating away at a mind-boggling
speed away from where the transaction
occurred this event occurred the the
actual attack on the craft occurred
about 10 miles east of sedro woolley I&#39;d
say about three miles north of the area
called Lyman Hamilton on its on-schedule
River in Northwest Washington State
outside of the speed the thing that was
most impressive about these targets is
their capacity to have abrupt turns we
buy we people in war and air defence
look at mass and turning radius well we
had nothing that was capable of matching
their capacity for minuscule turning
radiuses I mean we&#39;re talking about
virtually no radius turns at high speeds
2,000 miles an hour right angle turn not
only turns but descents and and and a
sense where they would they would
descend rapidly it didn&#39;t seem to make
any difference to them
where
in which direction they went at 11:14 in
98
November 14th 98 I was sitting my front
room again this time I was watching a
movie lights were off in my house my
estimates were it was approximately a
mile across 1,100 feet thick moving
approximately 600 miles an hour without
sound I did I did get a very very clear
view of a bad shape because that evening
was a light frost it was clear the moon
was out could see its shape very well
there were hundreds of lights on it it
was roughly triangular shape a little
bit of a truncated triangular shape
because it at the back the backside it
wasn&#39;t perfectly it was true it was a
like a triangle that&#39;s kind of cut off
and that I could see the sides of it
there were rows of lights going up the
sides there were rows of lights going
around the perimeter there were rows of
lights going across the bottom I called
my I called my kids up lived in
sedro-woolley in town after I saw a
number of silent Jets come from the
south and single file form in intervals
and fly through the flight path jets
were so quiet you almost can&#39;t hear them
on tapes I&#39;d never seen the model of
jets and I&#39;m pretty good at identifying
just particularly military jets they
normally when they&#39;re flying in our area
they fly from west to east on the Cultus
ridge which which is where they were
supposed to to fly these flew from
directly north from south to north when
they move through the flight path of the
object the after they move through it
they would take an immediate really hard
left and head westward then they went on
a dogleg and when they got to receive
der Wille and headed north so I don&#39;t
know where they were going
the second jet I filmed when he was
flying through the the flight path of
the object turned on
bright light I can only imagine what
what the purpose of it was but for
different jets came at four four minute
intervals all exact flights and at same
same exact like that
