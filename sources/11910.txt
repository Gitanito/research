  		              		Experience Description   

    Firstly, I am a retired police officer from Queensland in Australia. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology/sociology. I am non-religious, nor am I superstitious. I have two highly-educated young adults and one of them is a clinical neuro-psychologist the other has a PhD in IT.
  
  I don’t see religious figures, get lotto numbers or believe in tarot cards or play with Ouija boards.
  
  My experiences are very human-related, mostly of seeing people who have passed on. My first experience was when I was young. My uncle, who had passed on, came to me and said goodbye.  Since this experience, I have seen quite a few deceased people who were usually visiting to say goodbye.  They were wearing recognizable clothes and appeared like they were in another dimension. I also saw three dead women overseeing a fatal crash where they were killed. They were hugging each other and overlooking the scene. These are rare experiences for me, but I will outline the most significant visit which happened in the mid-1980’s in Victoria, Australia.
  
  My wife and I had visited my wife and her family  in Tasmania for a quick visit. This was many years before  this happened. My sister and I  rarely spoke on the phone and email was not available.  Essentially, we had little contact.

  I was visiting my parents as they had rented a holiday house. My sister also came up from Tasmania with her three boys. My sister’s husband was killed in a motorcycle crash in Tasmania about a year before this experience. I did not attend the funeral due to work, and never spoke to her as my mother conveyed the news. I was never told the details of his death except that he ran into the back of a truck and was killed. 
  
  Later in the day, I was relaxing reading a magazine in the lounge room; I had to go to work that evening. My sister was doing dishes in the kitchen. I noticed a figure standing, with his arms folded, and looking out of the window. He wore a white shirt with horizontal green stripes, fawn-colored pants and black shoes. He did not seem happy. I yelled jokingly to my sister that someone was here. She entered the room and I described what I saw. She stated that it was her husband, wearing what she had buried him in. She brought the clothes especially for his burial. He came toward us and I could hear him clearly.  He was not happy about a boyfriend she was seeing, what she was doing on their small farm, and other issues. She answered when I relayed his questions to her. She appeared to know what he was talking about. I had no knowledge of her activities or relationships. This went on for about 10 minutes. He then moved away,  kept a distance for a short time, and then left. 
  
  When we told my mother, she was shocked. She is a practicing Catholic. When talking to my sister's husband, I noticed that his shirt collar was done up to the top of his neck and that one side of the collar was lifted up at an angle.  I never mentioned the collar to my sister, but did mentioned it to my mother who did attend the funeral. She said they had to raise the collar due to injuries he had received. I had presumed he would have received chest injuries. 
  
  I have many science books, books on NDEs, and have been looking for a scientific answer to this occurrence for many years; but, to date, cannot find it. If any light can be shown on an explanation, scientifically I would be very pleased. Just for your information, I am glad science is tackling the issues of NDEs. I can also see auras and do not take drugs, drink or have psychological issues.
