I was running back and forth across the street, there was a church half way down this street where a wedding was taking place. There were hundreds of people blocking the street. While I was at the end of this street, a car came around the corner and ran over my head. I don't remember being run over. My mom started screaming and people ran over to me. I was told I was under the car so they pulled me out and I was not breathing. 

I saw a light, which was shining on me, and when I looked behind me, I was floating out of my body. I felt warmth all around me. When I turned around, I saw two spirits there that I did not know. The two spirits looked at me and then one of the two male spirits grabbed my arms and pushed me back into my body. 

I was unconscious and remember waking up in hospital. When I awoke, my family was around my bed. I had broken arms, one leg in plaster, a fractured skull and blood coming from my ears. My NDE lasted about a minute. When I spoke to my mum, she told me that when they pulled me from under the car, I was not breathing. Then one minute later she said I just stood up and started screaming and breathing again of my own accord.
