MEETING OF THE COUNCIL.
THE 175th Meeting of the Council was held at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W., on Thursday, December 9th, 1920, at
3 p.m. ;
SIR OLIVER LODGE in the Chair. There were also
JAN., 1921. Meeting of the Council. 3
present : Mr. W. W. Baggally, Sir William Barrett, Rev.
M. A. Bayfield, Captain E. N. Bennett, Hon. Everard Feilding,
Sir Lawrence Jones, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Mr. W. H. Salter,
Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Mr. W. Whately
Smith, and Dr. V. J. Woolley ; also, Mrs. Salter, Editor, and
Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.
The Minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read
and signed as correct.
Twenty-three new Members were elected. Their names and
addresses are given above.
The monthly Accounts for October and November, 1920,
were presented and taken as read.
A letter was read from Mr. St. G. L. Fox Pitt resigning
his membership of the Society.
Sir Lawrence Jones proposed the following resolutions,
which were seconded by Dr. F. C. S. Schiller and carried
unanimously :
(1) In view of certain reflections made on the Secretary
and the Editor of the Journal and Proceedings in the course
of the trial :
Radclyffe-Hall v. Fox Pitt., the Council wish
to put on record their unabated confidence in these two
ladies, and their repudiation of the suggestions made against
them.
(2) In the opinion of the Council the aspersions on the
Committee of Reference made in the course of the same trial
were entirely unwarranted.
On the proposal of Mrs. Sidgwick, seconded by Sir William
Barrett, Dr. V. J. Woolley was elected joint Honorary Secretary :
and, on the proposal of Mr. Piddington, Mr. W. H. Salter
was elected Hon. Treasurer of the Society Mr. Piddington
intending to resign the latter post in January. On the
proposal of Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Piddington was elected
a Vice-President. To the place on the Council left vacant
by Mr. Fox Pitt's resignation, the Rev. M. A. Bayfield,
hitherto a co-opted member, was appointed.
It was agreed that a Conversazione for Members and
Associates should be held after the Annual General Meeting
at the end of January.

PRIVATE MEETING FOR MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES.
THE 65th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only
was held in the Council Chamber, at 20 Hanover Square,
London, W., on Thursday, December 9th, 1920, at 5 p.m. ;
SIB OLIVER LODGE in the chair.
THE HON. RESEARCH OFFICER read a report on "A Series
of Sittings held recently with Mademoiselle
'
Eva C.'," with
lantern slides ;
and a discussion followed. It is hoped that
the full Report will be published later in the Proceedings.
A METHOD OF INVESTIGATION INTO THOUGHT-
TRANSFERENCE.
By F. H. VAN LOON, M.D., O.B.E., and A. A.
[EDITORIAL NOTE. The authors of the following report,
Dr. F. H. van Loon and Dr. Weinberg, have been members
of the" S.P.R. for just over a year. We understand from Dr.
Weinberg that since this report was sent to us he has, in Dr. van
Loon's absence, continued his experiments with other collaborators
and obtained interesting results, which are to be published in
the Proceedings of the Dutch Society for Psychical Research.
The experiments carried out by other investigators have perhaps
been rather more numerous and more systematic than the Intro-
duction to the present report suggests. But no one will deny
the importance at the present time of conducting carefully devised
experiments on as large a scale as possible with a view to deter-
mining the laws of telepathic communication, concerning which
we are at present almost entirely ignorant. We hope that others
of our members who are qualified for the task, may be moved
to follow the good example of Dr. van Loon and Dr. Weinberg.
It is suggestive to compare the positive results which they
obtained with the negative results obtained by Dr. Troland (see
Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXI., p. 218), in which the emotional element
to which the present writers attach considerable importance, was
noticeably absent.]
INTRODUCTION.
IT is a well-known fact nowadays that especially during
1

JAN., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought- Transference. 5
the last two or three decennia, since several scientific men,
interested in the problems of psychical research, have tried
to unveil the hidden truth they suspected in so many false
statements concerning psychical phenomena, real cases of
telepathy and thought-transference have been observed. It
seems to us, however, that it will be necessary for building
up the higher and loftier storeys of our so eagerly longed-for
Palace
"
Psyche," to try and make more solid foundations
in order to prevent it from becoming top heavy or a
"
chateau
en Espagne." . . .
On this account we had better apply our general methods
of investigation to this special branch of psychology and
try and find out the laws under which the simpler phenomena
occur. Till now many descriptions, sometimes of real literary
value, of these and other (also
"
spiritistic ") manifestations
have been given but there has never been published a
system, nor has a scheme been laid out that could be followed
by any scientifically trained man who concerned himself
with this matter. For here we do not agree with others
who think one person is as good as another when investi-
gating psychical phenomena. Sir Oliver Lodge in The
Survival of Man writes : "It is often cursorily imagined
that an adequate supply of the critical and cautious spirit
necessary in this investigation is a monopoly of professed
men of science. It is not so. Trained students of literature
not to mention experts in philosophy have shown them-
selves as careful, as exact, as critical, and as cautious, as
any professed student of science." This may have been
true during the first years of the existence of the Society for
Psychical Kesearch but it will not be this type of investigator
who will find the psychical laws and rules by which
"
thought
"
and other psychical processes can be transferred from man
to man, when not by speech or other
"
indirect
"
means.
For in this matter, as much as in any branch of science,
we now not only want good and accurate observers and
witnesses of apparitions and seances and phenomena, but
scientifically trained and scientifically thinking men, who
not only are able to exclude fraud conscious or unconscious,
but who are able to find other and better experiments, which
are necessary if ever we are to be able to proceed on our
6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
long and difficult way to truth and evidence about Psychical
Phenomena.
Now it became clear to us, as soon as we had studied
the
"
telepathic
"
experiments as described by former investi-
gators, that ^nearly
all of them followed the same way
a way lacking in scientific method.
For most of them experimented in thought-transference
on this principle only, of taking due precaution against any
possible fraud, muscle-reading, etc. ;
as a rule they only
made one sort of experiment trying to transfer visual im-
pressions from an
"
agent
"
to a
"
percipient."
We thought it very probable that not all the contents of
consciousness could be transferred with equal ease, considering
the fact that the various processes of consciousness make
a very different impression on the human mind. Starting
from this idea we formed the following scheme, which
in our opinion ought to be followed in further researches into
thought-transference.
Scheme.
It has to be made out : 4
1. Whether thought-transference, that is to say, the
active part of the
"
agent
"
as well as the passive
one of the percipient, is a faculty only of some
persons, or whether this is a latent power inherent in
every human being, which may be developed more or
less in at least the majority of men.
2. Whether there are conditions, as differences in sur-
roundings, in distance between experimenters, in the
time of the day, etc., as well as those (probably
more important), in the characters of the agents or
percipients, which are favourable or unfavourable
to experiments in thought-transference.
3. In what way and by what means thought-trans-
ference takes place, and whether there is any difference
in the manner and the degree of the transference
of the various mental processes or impressions.
In this direction an enormous field of future exploration
lies open and only by minute and systematic experiments
JAN., 1921. Method of //>.W ',<]{ Inn info thought-Transference. 7
shall we be able to enlarge and improve our knowledge about
the big question :
"
What is Psyche ?
"
When we started with our own experiments we had an idea
that one kind of mental process especially would be trans-
mitted more easily than others ;
i.e. impressions of an emotional
character. This idea arose in our minds after seeing the perform-
ance of a professional
"
telepathist," who, under the pseudonym
"
Eugen de Rubini," had a great success all through Holland
with his well-known thought-reading seances ;
when we were
talking with Mr. de .Rubini he told us he wanted as
"
leaders
"
people who could
"
think
"
strongly, that
"
in-
differently "-thinking people were no use, etc. We saw (and
felt) that the experiment succeeded extremely well as soon
as the
"
leader
"
became emotional ;
and afterwards, when we
ourselves were occupied with these well-known
"
hide-and-
seek "-experiments, we found our first impression right: the
emotionality both of
"
leader
"
and telepathist was absolutely
necessary for success.
For the rest it may be expected that emotionally-coloured
processes of consciousness will be transferred more easily than
others, because the former make the deepest impression on
the human mind, succeed in drawing all its attention, and
remain longer close under the threshold of consciousness.
This idea is in accordance with other well-known facts ;
we know that there are many tales, and also some well-
observed facts, *of clairvoyance, real long-distance telepathy,
etc. ;
and that in nearly all these cases the transferred facts
or feelings were of a highly emotional character such as
sudden death, or illness, etc. ;
and that these phenomena
nearly always occurred between close relations, intimate friends,
or husband and wife that there was usually an emotional tie
between the two parties concerned.
For this reason we changed the old experiments in this
respect that we tried to give them all an emotional feature ;
instead of the more or less indifferent visual impressions of
shape in the experiments Myers, Lodge, Barrett, etc., tell
us of, we tried to transfer :
1. colours ; 2. tastes ;
3. feelings ;
4. moods.
We were so lucky as to find two absolutely trustworthy
young men who had discovered in themselves a telepathic

ability, in the
"
Rubini "-way of the
"
Willing-Game." namelyr
Mr. A. S. van Dam, student of philosophy, and Mr. P. Smit,
technical head of a sugar factory at Groningen. Both are
very intellectual, and strongly interested in the problem, and
we are greatly obliged to both of them for their disinterested
help.
In addition, we had the pleasure of trying two other experi-
ments with Miss Anny Fekken, twenty-one years old. a pro-
fessional telepathist in this part of the country with whom
remarkable results, different 'from those obtained with the
other percipients, were acquired. She too is
highly intellectual
very sensitive and emotional, just as the two other telepathistsr
and at our request she was at once ready to put herself
at our disposal.
We will now give the reports made during the seances
by one of us, while the other one was the agent. Occasionally,
however, the two of us were acting as agents ; but during
these experiments Dr. v. L. took down the remarks without
delay, whereas Dr. W. went on concentrating his thoughts
without interruption. Most questions to the percipient were
asked by Dr. v. L. in an absolutely indifferent form and
voice ;
as a rule these questions are between round
brackets. We began at first by thinking of sensations and
emotions till they were projected by us as hallucinations.
Owing to the subjective character of these experiments and
the consequent difficulty of ascertaining whether the experiment
was reliable or not, we resolved to arrange matters differently
on the next evening. We then started by making use of real
stimuli, and moods were only chosen for transmission if the
agent felt predisposed. The experiments were always preceded
by a few performances of the
"
Willing-game," after which
the telepathist felt more disposed to the other experiments,,
and so a distinctly perceptible mental contact was brought
about between percipient and agent.
We are sorry to state that we were unable to hold more
than nine seances on account of the departure for the East
Indies of one of us. Both of us intend, however, to continue
the experiments as soon as possible.

DETAILED REPORT.
I. October 28? 1919. 8 p.m. Dr. Weinberg's study
Present : Mr. A. S. van Dam, percipient ;
Dr. F. H. van Loon,
Dr. Weinberg.
Some experiments of the
"
Willing-game
''
are tried, first with
and then without contact ;
they are perfectly successful ; especi-
ally with Dr. W., who had repeatedly conducted the percipient
before ;
there is a very strong
"
contact," which is perceived
by both parties.
After this the percipient is told that we will try to transfer
a thought ;
this makes the percipient feel a little nervous, he
has some doubts about the results of this kind of experiment.
1. The percipient is sitting on a chair, blindfolded ;
Dr. van L.
and Dr. W. are sitting behind him. They hold a playing-card
behind his back, and concentrate their thoughts on it (queen of
hearts) ;
P. says that he does not feel anything, and guesses
wrongly (clubs).
2. A similar experiment (knave of spades) failure (diamonds
guessed).
[Note. The failure of the experiments is ascribed to the non-
emotional character of the
"
thoughts," and on this account it
is decided that the next experiment shall be on colours.
P. doubts of the good result ;
he says he will only mention
a colour if he sees it distinctly.]
3. The room is darkened (i.e. there is no light at all) ; Dr. W.
is seated behind P., at the same time holding P.'s left hand.
Dr. W. tries to fix his thoughts on light red so strongly that
he has an hallucination of it.
After 2 or 3 minutes P. suddenly exclaims decidedly :
"
Red"
He tells us that he saw it clearly in the shape of a rectangle
lying flat. Dr. W. declares that he saw it in the same shape.
4. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : white.
At the end of a few minutes P. sees a signal-light, partly
blue, partly white.
After 7 minutes P. calls out :
"
Red-violet."
At first Dr. v. L. had been fixing his thoughts on blue, the
colour we had wished to take before we had decided to take
white. Dr. W. had not succeeded in getting an image of whiter
but had only had a vision of red tinged with violet. Both
Dr. W. and P. saw the colour like a large arc.
Hypothesis. Did the last experiment suffer from an after-effect
produced by the preceding one ? As we suppose this to bo
the case we intend to trv a fresh ex
10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
5. Same conditions. r
Impression to be conveyed : sensation of cold.
After about 1 minute P. complains of cramp in his contact-
hand, he feels as if an electric-current passes through it ;
a
moment later he remarks : "I cannot help thinking of my
hand, it feels quite cold
"
;
after 4 minutes P. observes : "It
is odd about that hand, I am shivering." After 6 minutes he
resumed :
"
Indeed, I cannot but think of that hand." He
rubs the back of his hand again and again. On inquiry P. says
he had a strong sensation of cold, especially in his left hand
and in the left part of his body. He describes the shiverings
and the cramp in his hand as similar to those felt on
1
coming
ashore after a bathe when the air is cold. Dr. W. remarks that
he felt the auto-suggested cold very strongly, and suffered from
shivering.
6. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : an emotional mood ;
terror.
After about 3 minutes P. exclaims decidedly : "A wretched
mood ! A wretched feeling !
"
He could not define it more
accurately. After 6 minutes :
"
Sadness
"
;
after 7 minutes :
"
Not pure sadness but mixed with vexation." This last sensation
was not felt very distinctly ;
but it was evident that it was
of an unpleasant nature ;
he says that he has even got into a
sad mood. Dr. W.'s auto-suggestion of terror had been far
from perfect, as in reality he had never come across anything
that had given him a sensation of terror.
7. Same conditions.
We try to make the following experiment (a number) emotional
too.
Dr. W. is to think of ten, as the highest mark for a trial-paper.
After some minutes P. observes : "I cannot see anything
distinctly. Can it be 3 or 5 ?"
8. Same conditions.
Number : two. P. cannot see anything distinctly. Guesses 8.
Dr. W. could not concentrate his thoughts on 2.
9. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, dull grey.
At the very beginning, when the experiment was interrupted,
P. said :
"
Light blue, but that is impossible, I have guessed
it far too soon." After 4 minutes :
"
I do not see anything
distinctly, again and again just a flash of brown, yellowish-brown."
In reply to a question :
"
Dim, not clear, a dirty colour !
"
After the continuation of the trial P. does not become much
wiser ;
he gets a different impression now, it is no longer a
colour ;
he sees just a flash without colour. Dr. W. at first
JAN., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 11
also saw something of a yellowish-grey colour ;
after the second
interruption he also saw it
differently, which he remarked during
the experiment ;
he saw it darker, a dull grey.
II. October 29, 1919. 8.30 p.m. Dr. Weinberg's study.
Present : Mr. A. S. van Dam, percipient ;
Dr. F. H. van Loon,
Mrs. van Loon, Dr. Weinberg, Mrs. Weinberg.
The
"
Rubini-experiments
"
are not very successful in comparison
with other days.
P. explains that he has had a very fatiguing day and that he
has just left a meeting where he had exerted himself very much.
1. P. is sitting on the sofa ;
Dr. W. is sitting on a chair
nearly opposite to him, without contact. P. is blindfolded, and
the room is dark.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, green (hallucination on the
part of Dr. W.).
After 1 minute P. says :
"
Blue."
Dr. v. L. asks :
"
Distinctly ?
"
P. :
"
Yes, light blue !
"
P. is asked to indicate the colour, and points to a greenish-blue
colour.
[Note. P. is a little green-blue colour-blind.]
2. Same conditions (no contact).
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, yellow.
After 1 minute P. says : "I have seen red again, but it
is already gone."
After 5 minutes : "I am constantly troubled by the blue
colour, I saw just now." The experiment is stopped.
Dr. W. says that he could not bring yellow before his mind,
that he saw red again and again.
[Note. As it is too difficult to make sure of the reliability
of this kind of experiment, real stimuli will be used as far as
possible henceforth.]
3. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a sensation of itching.
Dr. W. scratches himself under his knee ;
after 1 minute
on his left index.
P. (after 2 minutes) : "I get a hot feeling in the fingers of
my left hand, just like electric shocks
"
;
after 3 minutes :
"
My
fingers feel tired
"
;
after 4 minutes :
"
Now they feel cold."
A question by Dr. v. L. :
"
Another sensation yet ?
" "
Only
as if a cold wind passes over my hands." |
4. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
Dr. W. pinches the back of his left hand. P. is sitting as
before, but is leaning his elbows on his knees, so that Dr. W.
cannot be seen by him.
After 1 minute :
"
A painful prick." (" Where ?
")
"
In the back of my right hand."
5. Impression to be conveyed : colour and shape, a red apple.
P. is sitting on a chair, blindfolded ; an electric light is burning
behind him. Also behind him is a little round table, on the
further side of which Dr. W. is sitting. On the table is a piece
of black cloth on which there is a red apple. The apple was
taken from a dish, containing other kinds of fruit also, after P.
was blindfolded.
Dr. W. gazes at the apple.
After 2 minutes :
"
Yellowish-brown." (" Distinct ? ")
"
Dirty."
"
Can you distinguish a shape ?
"
"I have lost it, I saw it
with dots on it." (" Can you see the shape of the object ? ")
"
I do not see anything now."
6. Impression to be conveyed : a taste, salt.
P. leaves the room. Dr. W. takes salt into his mouth. P.
enters again and sits down as in 5. After 1 minute :
"
What
an amount of saliva all at once !
"
("Is it a definite taste ? ")
"
I am not quite sure yet ;
in any case it is not very pleasant."
After 3 minutes :
"
Salt."
At the end of the experiment P. says : "At first I did not
know exactly whether it was salt or bitter, but all at once I got
the taste, especially at the tip of my tongue." Dr. W. too had
had a taste of salt that was slightly bitter, especially at the
tip of his tongue.
7. Same conditions as in 5.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
Dr. W. pinches himself in his right calf. After 1 minute
P. says :
"
It is muscular pain in my right teg." This feeling
of pain continued for 3 minutes.
8. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
Dr. W. pinches himself in his right side.
"Itching," P. says. "(Where?") "In several places, on
my temple-bone, leg and hand." After 3 minutes : "On my
cheek-bone, a peculiar feeling, burning, painfully burning ;
it is
distinct, it is not pleasant, so much is certain."
"
(Anywhere
else ? ")
"
The pain passes from my left cheek-bone, out of
my molars. Headache."

"
with moderate success. Mr. van Dam
does not feel in a mood for experiment ;
he cannot help thinking
too much, for he had just been examining soldiers.
1. Same conditions as in II. 6.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sour.
While P. is out of the room Dr. W. takes some vinegar into
his mouth.
No one present tells to P. what sort of experiment it is going
to be.
P. supposes that it is a taste. After half-a-minute he says :
""
An astringent taste in my mouth." (" Can you taste it more
accurately ?
')
t;
No, not at this moment ; my mouth is drawn
together an acid taste."
2. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sweet.
P. is not informed of the sort of experiment. Dr. W. has a
sweetmeat in his mouth. After 10 seconds he says : "I think
it is a taste again. I cannot get rid of., the taste I had before ;
it is still the same." ("Is it exactly the same ?
")
"
Yes, it
predominates continually, but in the passage [between the two
experiments] it was gone for a moment.
3. Same conditions as in II. 5.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, black.
P. is not informed of the sort of experiment. Dr. W. looks
at a cushion, of which he sees the black top ;
the opposite
side is red. After 2 minutes : P. says :
"
I do not think I can
guess what it is." (" Have you any idea ? ") "I do not perceive
anything distinctly !
"
After 3 minutes P. says :
"
It is a colour.
Now and then I feel something, but the same thing happens in
ordinary circumstances." After 4 minutes :
"
I saw after each
other :
rose-red, which quickly darkened to black, several pictures
after each other, just as at a bioscope." After 6 minutes :
"
It
is a kind of red." (" Light or dark ? ") After 7 minutes :
"
Very
dark." (" What colour then ? ")
"
Very <lark red."
4. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood, drowsiness, dullness.
Dr. W. is sitting nearly behind P.
After 2 minutes P. begins to yawn, sighs deeply, and says :
'"
Not a pleasant mood, I feel so down. Sad mood !
"
After
2 minutes :
;i
I do not feel anything now." (" Was it distinct ? ")
*
No, it was very weak, as everything to-night, except taste."
14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research: JAN., 1921,
(" Try to define it more accurately.'') "I do not feel anything,
now." After 6 minutes :
(" Do you not feel anything again ? ")
"
Just wait a moment. No."
5. Same conditions as in II. 6.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sweet.
P. is not informed of the sort of experiment.
Dr. van L. says :
"
Try if
you notice anything, but you should
only say something if
your sensations are clear."
After 1 minute P. says: "No feeling, and no mood, so much
I know for certain." After 1^ minutes :
"
I think it is a taste,.
but I am not quite sure." After If minutes :
"
Is it right or
not ?
" "
Try to find it out without help."
"
Yes, but it is so
difficult to get rid of a preconceived idea ; you cannot help
going on thinking in that direction."
Dr. v. L. says :
"
It is a taste."
After 4J minutes :
"
Saltish. But it is not only salt, there
is another taste too." (" What do you taste besides ? ")
"
Salt
is predominant, but there is something else." (" Try to settle
what this is.")
"
A somewhat prickling taste, a little like pickle
in that way." ("Is it clear ? ")
"
Fairly ;
it is most like pickle ;
it seems to alter a little ;
the taste of salt is getting weaker ;
it is not unpleasant, perhaps a little sourish ;
not vinegar ;
it
is a well-known stuff, but I cannot say what it is."
6. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of warmth.
Dr. v. L., agent. Dr. W., observer.
Dr. W. holds a warm pipe in Dr. v. L.'s right hand. P. is
informed that it is a feeling. After 4| minutes :
"
My right
leg is itching, my thigh." Dr. W. asks :
"
Is it very distinct ?
"
"
Not now, but it was a moment before." After 6 minutes :
"
Now it is
coming again the same feeling." The pipe has
become cold. Dr. v. L. scratches himself about the place of
the tendon of Achilles. P. complains, however, that he cannot
help thinking, after which we make an end of the experiment.
7. Same conditions.
Impression to be conveyed :
pain.
P. is informed of the srt of experiment.
*
Dr. v. L. pricks Dr. W. intermittently with a needle on the
back of his right hand. After 2 minutes : P. says : "A prickling
as from an electric current ;
I felt it on the back of my right
hand." (" Is it
pleasant or not ?
")
"
Unpleasant, just as if
you come with your hand too close to the stove, but it is not
warmth, it prickles." (" Could you indicate exactly what and
where it is ?
"
"It is a prickling pain on the back of my
JAN., 1921. Meth(KI

right, hand ;
it is very distinct." (" Is it a continuous sensa-
tion ?") "No it is not, it is a prickling pain."
Note. The next experiments all took place under the following
conditions :
P. sits in an armchair in a corner of the room at a little table,
on which there is a piece of paper and a lead-pencil. He is in
such a position that he cannot see any mirror or reflecting object.
The lamp behind him is turned off and a twilight lamp has been
put by his side, in order to prevent him from guessing anything
about the nature of the experiment from any shadows thrown.
P. is also blindfolded. Behind P. there is a little smoking-table,
on the further side of which the agent is sitting. There is no
contact whatever between the two persons, nor does the agent
touch P.'s chair. The experiments are not begun before all
precautionary measures have been taken. To the side of the
agent and the percipient under the twilight lamp the observer(s)
is (are) sitting.
The percipient is always informed beforehand of the sort of
experiment to be tried.
IV. November 8, 1919. 8.30 p.m. Dr. Weinberg
;
s study.
Present : Mr. P. Smit, percipient ;
Dr. van Loon, Dr. Weinberg.
Mr. Smit mentions that he has already tried some experiments
in the
"
Willing-Game," but very seldom without contact. He
ascribes his faculty chiefly to muscle-reading.
From a few
"
Rubini-experiments
"
with contact it is evident
that Mr. Smit pays attention to the movements of the con-
ductor ;
as we hardly betray ourselves by involuntary movements
the experiments turn out failures, unless if we lead Mr. Smit
into a certain direction by intentional movements ! It is very
remarkable that the result of the experiments is much greater
without contact, because Mr. Smit does not pay attention to
our movements then, but his whole mind is open to any impres-
sions he may get.
1. Conditions as noted above ;
two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, light red.
Dr. v. L. and Dr. W. look at a piece of silk of this shape :
After some] minutes P. says :
"
I see something of a yellowish
16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
colour." A moment later :
" ;
I see light red ; yellowish red ?
"
<" What shape ? ")
" Not distinct." P. draws thus :
2. Conditions as above ;
two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a geometrical figure
After 3 minutes P. says :
"
I see only one half of it." He
draws two figures and says :
"
How strange, I see only their
halves."
3. Conditions as above ;
two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, light green.
The agents look at a rectangular piece of silk of a light green
colour.
After 3 minutes P. says : ''I saw a light green strip" P. draws
the right shape in the air.
4. Conditions as above ;
two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, salt.
After some minutes P. says :
"
It is not sweet, but an un-
pleasant taste ;
I cannot define it exactly." After 5 minutes :
"It is unpleasant ;
not decidedly bitter and not sourish ;
it is a
prickling taste on the tongue." (" Can you define it accurately ? ")
"It is saltish now."
[Note. P. says that a stimulus does not make an impression
until after some minutes ;
first he has to detach himself from
his thoughts.]
5. P. suggests that he should guess some playing-cards.
Conditions as above.
The cards are drawn from a complete pack and looked at
-by Dr. W.
Card drawn : three of clubs. P. guesses :
"
Queen of clubs."
JAK., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Trasuxference. 17
6. Card drawn :
queen of spades. P. guesses : "A king."
7. Card drawn : nine of diamonds. P. guesses :
"
Clubs."
8. Card drawn : nine of spades. P. guesses :
"
Black colour.
One of the spades ?
"
9. P. says that he guessed too quickly in the previous cases.
He intends to do it more slowly.
Card drawn : knave of clubs. After 1 minute P. says : "A
picture. A queen or a knave ?
"
After 1J minutes : "A black
colour clubs. I think of two cards :
queen of clubs or knave
of spades. Is it knave of spades ?
"
10. Card drawn : ace of diamonds. P. guesses :
"
Spades ;
I
think, no picture, 8 or 9."
11. Card drawn : six of clubs. P. says :
"
I am thinking of
a,
king, a black colour ;
the king remains before my eyes."
12. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
Dr. W. pinches himself in his right calf.
After 2 minutes P. says :
"
This leg." He indicates the
right place on his right calf. "Or is it the draught on my leg ?
"
{" What do you feel ? ")
"
I cannot say that it is very pleasant.
It is as if
my leg is pinched." He indicates the exact place on
his calf.
13. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, brown.
The agent looks at a dark brown piece of cloth on a white
ground.
P. sees all sorts of colours together. He asks :
"
Is it dark ?
Dark or greenish ?
"
(" Can you see it distinctly ? ")
"
No ;
it is very dim." P. asks : "Is there no white or black among
those colours ?
"
Then :
"
No, the ground may be white or
black." A little later :
"
The ground is white. I see a dark
object on a white ground ;
it is a mixed colour in which I detect
blue. Purple ?
"
(" Try to determine what the dark colour is.")
"
That is too difficult ;
I cannot do it. Is it a mixed colour
with blue ? It is a mixed colour with blue or red." (" What
-colour is it ? ")
"
Dark on white."
14. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, red.
The agent looks at a red piece of silk on black ;
the silk of
this shape :
18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
After 30 seconds P. says :
"
I see 2 colours again, a light
one and a dark one.'' After 1| minutes :
"
Has it an angle ?
A right angle?" P. indicates the shape correctly. ("Try to
see what colour it is.")
"
Purplish." ("On what ground ? ")
After some time :
"
It is sometimes light, sometimes dark ;
nothing is clear. When I saw it as a triangle the ground wa&
dark ;
I cannot detach myself from my thoughts."
V. November 11, 1919. 8.30 p.m. Dr. Weinberg's study.
Present : Mr. P. Smit, percipient ;
Dr. van Loon, Dr. Wein-
berg, Mrs. Weinberg.
A "
Rubini-experiment
"
without contact is tried, but fails.
1. Conditions as noted on p. 15. Two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, orange.
Dr. v. L. and Dr. W. gaze at a rectangular piece of orange-
coloured stuff on a black ground.
P. sees something of a rectangular shape on a black ground.
After this the black ground is exchanged for one of white paper.
P. now sees a dark thing of the same shape on a light ground ;
he asks :
"
Is it a brownish red ?
"
(" Can you define accu-
rately ?") After 5 minutes: "I see it darker now; Wrish."
[Note. P. says that he is unable to see red colours or those
mixed with red clearly ;
he sees red as something very dark ;
this was the case on the previous occasion also.]
2. Conditions as above. Two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, blue.
The agents look at a piece of blue silk on white.
P. says :
"
It is square." (" Right.")
"
I saw two colours, blue
and green." (" What shade of blue ? ")
"
Ordinary blue, neither
dark nor light."
3. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sour.
The agent puts crystals of citric acid in his mouth.
After 1 minute P. says :
"
It is not sharp to the taste as last
time ;
not so unpleasant." (" Do you taste anything ? ")
"
A
prickling of the tongue ; nothing besides."
After 3 minutes :
"
It is prickling, it resembles the taste of
last time very much, saltish." After 5 minutes :
"
It is very
much like guessing. Is it an acid ?
"
(" What sort'' of acid ? ")
"
It is just like, e.g. acetic acid." (" What is it
then;? ")
"
I am
tasting an acid, I tasted it just now, and now again."
[Note. When the experiment is over P. tastes citric acid and
says that it is the same taste.]

4. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. \V.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
Dr. W. pinches his neck with his right hand. After 4 minutes
P. says :
"
Are you pinching something with your right hand ?
I -have a feeling of stiffness, as if I were holding something very
firmly in my hand." (" In your right hand ? ")
"
It is strange,
I feel in both hands and in my wrists as if you were pinching
something."
When the experiment is over, P. says that at first he felt
some pain in his neck.
5. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood, gladness.
Dr. W. thinks of his graduation. After 2 minutes P. says :
"
I cannot help bursting out laughing. Can it be that ? I
thought that you were rather frolicsome."
[Note. P.'s laughter was quite in contrast with his own mood,
as he was not satisfied with the success of the previous experi-
ments. He adds :
"
Again and again I burst out laughing ;
I
just felt as if I was going on the spree."]
6. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, light blue on a white
ground.
P. says :
"
I saw mostly green, a little lighter than this leaf."
(" What shape ? ")
"
Not clear."
[Note. When shown the piece of cloth used for the experiment
P. says he would call that also green.]
7. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed: a taste, mustard.
After 1 minute P. says : "I have not got rid of the previous
taste yet." (" What is it ? ")
"
Sour again."
8. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a sensation of warmth.
Dr. v. L. puts a burning cigar in the hollow of Dr. W.'s hand.
P. does not feel anything.
9. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood (vexation at the failure of
Dr. W.'s experiments).
After 2 minutes P. says :
"
This mood is contrary to the
previous one. You are thinking of something serious, of your
work, of something very serious in your daily life." (" Not
therefore a cheerful mood ? ")
"
No, you think of something
disagreeable, which vexes you every day."
20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921,
VI. November 13, 1919. 8 p.m. Dr. W.'s study.
Present : Mr. A. S. van Dam, percipient ; Professor Dr. G.
Heymans, Dr. v. Loon, Dr. Weinberg.
An intricate
"
Rubini-experiment
"
is very successful.
1. Conditions as noted above on p. 15. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, yellowish salmon-colourr
of this shape :
After 4| minutes P. says :
"
I get a weak impression of yellowr
very weak. I cannot distinguish the exact shade of yellow.
' r
(" What is the shape ? ")
"
I have not seen a shape yet."
"
An
irregular shape with angles." He draws the following figure :
2. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a sensation of pain.
Dr. v. L. pricks Dr. W. repeatedly with a needle behind his
right ear. Dr. v. L. gets a feeling of fatigue and pain in his
right arm by doing this, so that he has temporarily to use his left
arm in order to go on pricking. Dr. W. has relatively speaking
little pain.
After some minutes P. says :
"
Pain. Prickling, pain giving
shocks, passing from my right wrist through my arm." ("Is it
distinct ?
")
"
The painful feeling is
distinctly felt, but is not
so regular as last time."
3. Conditions as above. Two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sour.
Prof. H. and Dr. W. both take a crystal of citric acid in their
mouths.
After 1| minutes P. says :
''
A prickling taste." (" What taste
is it ? Do you taste it or not yet ? ") "It is coming, wait
a moment. It is not unpleasant sharp. It is not vinegar.
It is a stimulating taste I do not know exactly. It is not
distinct. I cannot give it a name. It is like cognac or
something of the sort, prickling, sharp and yet not unpleasant."
JAN., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 21
(" What taste is it ? ")
"
It is also a little sweet. I now get
such a mixture of tastes, it is all wrong. It is getting much sweeter.'"
[Note. After a crystal has been put in P.'s mouth he at once
decidedly recognises the taste.]
4. Conditions as above. Three agents.
Impression to be conveyed : an object ot different colours.
The Dutch standard (red, white, blue, lying horizontally on a
black ground). Prof. Dr. H., Dr. v. L. and Dr. W. gaze at it ;
the first two seeing the stripes vertically, Dr. W. horizontally.
After 1 minute P. says :
"
I see a long, blue strip ;
it i
horizontal." After 2 minutes :
"
Now I see the same strip again r
but now it is vertical, but with a white strip beside it." After
5 minutes :
"
I see again a blue strip but now it is horizontal
again ;
under it a white one and under this I see a broader
black colour." He draws an object of about the same size as
the standard itself, only the
"
black
"
strip nearly twice as broad
as the other ones.
[Note. When the experiment is over P. says that he had not
thought of the Dutch standard.]
VII. November 27, 1919. 3.50 p.m. A room of the Psychiatrical-
Neurological Hospital at Groningen.
The general conditions of the following experiments are as noted
above on p. 15.
Present : Mr. A. S. van Dam, percipient ;
Dr. v. Loon and
Dr. Weinberg.
A "
Rubini-experiment
"
succeeds fairly well.
1. Impression to be conveyed : the sensation of a galvanic
current.
Conditions of the experiment. Dr. W. puts the index and the
middle-finger of his right hand in a bath of 2 cells, which are
connected with a battery of 5 accumulators, placed in a corner
of the room behind a screen, which is in its usual place. In the
circuit has been placed a push-interruptor, which works without
noise ;
the cells and the interrupter are taken away from behind
the screen after P. has sat down. When the circuit is closed
Dr. W. feels a little, very slightly painful shock springing from
the knuckle of the index to the knuckle of the middle-finger.
He (Dr. W.) closes the circuit about once in a second.
After 1 minute P. says :
"
I see an object ;
it is not an
ordinary colour, it has a shape ;
I saw it only for one single
moment it had the shape of a ring now everything is gone."
Dr. v. L. says :
"
It is a feeling."
"
That is
strange. I saw a ring."
Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
Immediately P. stretches both hands forwards and rubs them
over each other.
"
I get a pricking feeling on the back of my
right hand." (
>;
Prickling ?
")
"
No, pricking ; but it is gone
now." After 4 minutes :
"
Now exactly the same feeling on the
knuckles of the fourth and the fifth finger of my left hand." He
points to it.
"
The feeling in the other hand is gone." (" Is it
a continuous feeling ? ")
"
No, it is not ;
it is pricking ;
in any
case pain, but not strong, by no means strong even, much weaker
than the pin-pricks of last time ;
it is now only in my left hand,"
After 5 minutes :
''
Now it is coming again ; in my left hand,
in the same knuckles." Dr. W. asks :
"
How do you feel it
now ?
"
"A prickling pain, but not so strong as a pin-prick."
"
A great many prickles ?
"
Dr. W. asks again.
"
No, they do
not follow each other quickly." Dr. v. L. :
"
How quickly ?
"
"
Perhaps one in a second," he replies. Dr. v. L. :
"
Have you
any idea what it is ?
" "
No, no pin-prick, but something far
weaker, as the prickling of soda-water on your tongue an electric
current, but that gives its pricks stronger and more quickly ;
it
is most like an electric current, only there are not nearly so many
pricks,"
After the experiment P. says he had thought it much weaker
than a faradic current as indeed it was !
2. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, dark violet.
The agent looks at a piece of dark violet paper in the shape
of an hour-glass on a white ground :
After half a minute P. says : "I have already seen something
for a moment, a black cross with light round it ;
it looked like
this (draws :
)
like the old iron cross on the German flying-machines." He
draws the same figure in the air. After 3 minutes :
"
Ever
and again I see flashes, but I do not know what it is." (" Try
again.") After 4 minutes :
"
For a short moment I get an
impression of red, but without any shape." After 4| minutes :
JAN., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 23
"
Now I have seen an angle, white at the foot and the angle
was dark." He draws it as follows :
After six minutes :
"
I do not see it any longer. Let us
stop : it is not getting clearer."
3. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, bitter (sol. chinini, 1/1000).
After one minute P. says :
"
Prickling." After 1J minutes :
"
Still prickling, also under my tongue, all over my tongue."
(" What taste is it ? ")
"
A little mixed with salt, but not
unpleasantly saltish. Now it is on the back of my tongue the
same, a little saltish, more prickling, no kitchen-salt at all events."
After 4 minutes :
"
Now it feels sharp in my throat." He coughs.
4. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed :
fatigue.
Dr. W. holds a heavy book in his extended right arm.
After 2 minutes P. says : "I again and again get a sensation
in the neighbourhood of my mouth : to the left ; in gums and
lip ;
I do not know exactly what ; but I hurt my mouth there
a little this afternoon." ("Try to feel it accurately.") "Yes,
but it is annoying, 1 cannot get rid of that feeling." (" Do you
feel anything else ? ") "No strong feeling ;
of course all sorts of
suggestions of itching, but those I do not take notice of any
longer. I do not feel anything positive."

REVIEWS.
I. Spiritualism : its Present-day Meaning. A Symposium. Edited
by HUNTLY CARTER. (Unwin. 8vo. 18s.)
THIS is a collection of thirty-nine essays which set forth the
extremely conflicting views of the authors on what is called by
the popular but unsatisfactory term
"
spiritualism," and are
answers to the following questionnaire sent out by the editor :
1. What, in your opinion, is the situation as regards the renewed
interest in psychic phenomena ?
24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1021.
2. In your view does this psychic renewal denote
(a) A passing from a logical and scientific (deductive) to a
spiritual and mystic (inductive) conception of life ?
or
(6) A reconciliation between the two, that is, between
science and faith ?
3. What, in your opinion, is the most powerful argument
(a) For, or
(6) Against, human survival ?
, 4. What, in your opinion, is the best means of organizing this
movement in the highest interest, philosophical, religious,
and scientific, of the nation, especially as a factor of durable
peace ?
These questions open a very wide field, and the writers of the
articles have taken full advantage of the latitude of choice per-
mitted to them. Thus 188 pages of the 287 of which the volume
consists are occupied with the subject from a philosophical and
theoretical point of view, and some fifty with the opinions which
writers representing various religious organisations have formed on
the subject, while the remainder deal with it from a more or
less but rather less than more scientific standpoint. The con-
tributions are of very various merit, and though several of the
papers are good and interesting, the actual amount of information
to be obtained from the whole is comparatively small. Few of
the authors have distinguished psychical research, as such, from a
number of other things, and the failure to do this is especially
unfortunate in the case of those who write (all, I think, with
hostility) from the Christian point of view. Never defining what
they mean by
"
spiritualism," they appear to deprecate psychical
investigation altogether, from a mistaken notion, arising surely
from want of knowledge, that it is anti-Christian because some
have sought to construct upon it a sort of new religion. This is
plainly obscurantism of a disastrous kind. Moreover, while people
will probably continue to make so-called religions out of anything,
there is no fear that any but the flimsiest can be built up on the
ascertained facts discovered by psychical research. If I may
speak for myself, so far as I can see, Christianity has found in it
not an enemy but an ally. The materialistic papers are as
innocent of argument as might be expected.

II. The Foundations of Spiritualism. By W. WHATELY SMITH.
(Kegan Paul. Post 8vo. 3s. 6d.)
THIS little book furnishes an excellent introduction to the subject
of psychical research and, despite its size, is of far more sub-
stantial value than the one just- noticed. Lucidly and tem-
perately written its form is that of a judicial summing-up it
gives succinctly the results which have been achieved up to the
present. If it has a fault, it is that it is too brief ;
but it
should leave the inquirer eager to learn more, and that is an
unquestionable merit. It is plain that the author is master of his
subject, so that one receives the impression that what he writes is
deserving of attention. It is to be hoped that the book is
having a large sale, for what the public needs more than anything
at this time, in this connexion, is just that simple positive in-
struction which is here given.
III. The Fellowship of the Picture. Edited by PERCY DEARMER.
(Nisbet. Sm. 8vo. Paper covers. 3s. 6d.)
THIS is a series of automatic scripts written by Mrs. Percy
Dearmer, the wife of Dr. Percy Dearmer, Professor of Ecclesiastical
Art at King's College, London. The scripts may be described as
a number of short papers having for their theme though this is
not stated in so many words- the petition which the war brought
into special prominence,
"
Thy kingdom come ... on earth even
as in heaven." They contain much that is wise and true and
beautiful, and I have noticed nothing which, allowing for some
admixture from the writer's subliminal, might not have come from
a discarnate spirit. On the other hand, I am told by those who
know Mrs. Dearmer that there is ample reason for believing her
subliminal to be quite capable of producing all that we have here.
There is not a scrap of positive evidence for spirit intervention;
the whole subject is, as I hear, one that she has much at heart,
and the spiritual atmosphere which pervades the book cannot be
said to be purer than her own may well be. Readers will form
their own opinion on the interesting and tantalising problem
which the scripts present. M. A. BAYFIELD.
IV. In Search of the Soul and the Mechanism of Thought, Emotion,
and Conduct. A Treatise containing a Brief but Comprehensive
History of the Philosophical Speculations and Scientific Re-
searches from Ancient Times to the Present Day, as well as,
26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1921.
an Original Attempt to Account for the Mind and Character
of Man and establish the Principles of a Science of Ethology.
By BERNARD HOLLANDER, M.D. (London :
Kegan Paul,
Trench, Trubner & Co. New York: E. P. Button & Co.
2 vols. Pp. v. i., 576 ; v. ii., 361. Price 2 2s. net.)
IT is not easy to discern for whom this very extensive com-
pendium is intended. Its first volume is a compilation of opinions
about the
'
soul
'
and its relations to the body from the Baby-
lonians to the present day, giving nearly 200 pages to Gall and
the controversy about
'
phrenology.' The second volume deals
with psychology (which Dr. Hollander restricts to intellectual
processes and distinguishes from
'
ethology
'
in order to emphasize the
importance of the emotions and feelings), the localization of mental
functions in the brain, genius, insanity and crime (with a rejection
of eugenics), the unexplored
'
Powers of the Mind,' including
hypnotism, subconsciousness, suggestibility, hyperaesthesia, dissocia-
tion, telepathy, the
'
spiritual nature
'
of man and immortality.
It is evident that from the point of view of a psychical re-
searcher the interest of the work is largely concentrated in this
last section, though it may well be that the author's conclusions
are consequential on the attitudes he has taken up before. And
these do not always seem to rest on a psychological analysis that
can be regarded as philosophically adequate. For example, the
enumeration of the theories about the relations of mind and brain
is seriously incomplete. It entirely omits the very important
*
transmission
'
theory of James, which, while not denying the
dependence of psychic states on brain functioning, has the advan-
tage of conceiving an alternative to the materialistic interpretation
of this dependence. In consequence of this omission Dr. Hol-
lander does not see that the evidence he adduces for the localiza-
tion of mental functions in the brain may not prove what he
desires, and entirely fails to see the significance of the considerable
body of evidence which shows that in brain lesions the functions
interrupted by the damage to their habitual paths of expression
may after a time learn to express themselves vicariously through
other channels.
Again, it hardly seems possible to give an adequate, or even a
coherent, account of the
'
dissociations
'
of personality, without
having something like a consistent philosophy about the nature of
'
souls,'
'
substances
'
and
'
entities,' and the way in which they
can combine unity and variety.- The same lack is felt when one
JAN., 1921. Reviews. 27
reads that
"
all men must grant that there must be a Power in the
universe from which all life and energy proceed or originally have
proceeded, a Power which cannot be comprehended or controlled by
human thought and will
"
(ii., p. 335). A critical philosopher will
object that, as stated, this postulate is self-frustrating, because a
'
Power '
that is not comprehended can explain nothing and so
cannot be a genuine necessity of thought unless necessities of
thought may be unsound delusions : he will note also that the
notions concerned,
'
power,'
'
universe,'
'
life,'
'
energy,' and
'
pro-
duction
'
(cause) are all human devices (more or less successful)
for comprehending and controlling human experience.
Coming finally to Dr. Hollander's conclusions, it may be noted
that he declares that
"
a ghost is nothing more or less than an
intensified telepathic vision
"
(p. 316), and is (too) positive that
"
Science has never touched the psychical ;
it is bound to be
material to be limited to phenomena which can be verified by
the senses
"
(p. 335). Here
"
verified by the senses
"
is surely
ambiguous. In one sense the sciences push far beyond the limits
of the senses : the ultimates, e.g. of physics,
'
atoms,'
'
electrons,'
etc., have long been such as not to be perceivable by the senses.
But they are believed in because there are ascribed to them
sensible effects, which they enable us to
'
explain
'
and control ;
hence they may be said to be indirectly
"
verified by the senses.'
'
The existence of
'
mind '
or
'
soul
'
or
'
spirit
'
is attested similarly.
We may bring this out by putting a test question to Dr. Hol-
lander. Would he deny or assert the existence of other minds
besides his own ? And would he claim that it was
"
verified by
the senses
"
?
Again, it is logically quite false that science is materialistic :
'
science
'
is essentially a method, and scientific method is as
applicable to conceptions about the psychical as to conceptions
about the material. Moreover, Dr. Hollander himself argues
forcibly in favour of scientific exploration of
'
extraordinary
phenomena
'
elsewhere (cf. ii., 316, 336), and rightly concludes that
"
instead of saying
'
man has a soul,' it would be more correct to
:say that
'
man himself is a soul.' He is not a conscious machine,
but a spiritual being." Certainly ;
but what is implied in being
a
'
spiritual being
'
is one of the things that science has to find
out. And psychical research, if not the only, is distinctly the
most promising of the scientific ways of finding out.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS.
THE Annual General Meeting of Members of the Society was
held at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Monday, January
31st, 1921, at 3.15 p.m., SIR OLIVER LODGE in the chair.
Other Members present were : Colonel C. E. Baddeley, Mr.
W. W. Baggally, Sir William Barrett, the Rev. M. A. Bayfield,
Captain E. N. Bennett, Mrs. Boustead, Miss Lucy Corry,
Miss Alice Cotterell, Mrs. Creasy, Mr. E. J. Bingwall, Miss
A. V. Button, The Hon. Everard Feilding, the Rev. W. S.
Irving, Sir Lawrence Jones, Mr. B. Jordan-Smith, Mr. J. G.
Piddington, Mr. F. Ransom, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Salter,
Mr. Sydney C. Scott, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Mr. W. Whately
Smith, Br. A. Wallace, Br. V. J. Woolley, and Mr. G. E.
Wright.
The Report of the Council for 1920 was read.
THE HON. TREASURER (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting the
Financial Statement for the year, said that the Society started
the year with a balance in hand of 452 7s. 4d., and ended
it with a balance of 255 14s. This could only be considered
as fairly satisfactory. The income of the Society was barely
sufficient to cover the ordinary expenditure, the most serious
item of which was the printers' bill, 824 having been paid
under this head in 1920, exclusive of a further bill for 475
for printing done in that year which had just been received.
The current expenditure left no surplus which could be applied
to special research work, such as the Society had undertaken
in the past year with regard to
"
Eva C." If, however,
the Society omitted, on the ground of expense, to do work
of this kind whenever a suitable opportunity occurred, it
would inevitably go backwards. It was therefore essential
that every effort should be made to increase the Society's
income, by enlarging the membership and otherwise.
THE CHAIRMAN, rising to move the adoption of the Report
and the Financial Statement, said that it was evident that
the work of the Society was going on in a satisfactory way.
Referring to the experiments with

and said that Mrs. Sidgwick's report, which was of
considerable interest, would show, when it appeared, the im-
mense amount of careful work that had been done in connexion
with this enquiry, and also how large the prospective printing
expenses were likely to be. He moved that the Keport and
Financial Statement be adopted. The resolution, which was
supported by Mr. Piddington and Dr. Woolley, was carried
unanimously.
The Chairman announced that four of the retiring Members
of the Council offered themselves for re-election, and that
to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Mr. H. Arthur
Smith and Sir J. J. Thomson, he proposed, and Mr. J. G.
Piddington seconded, Sir Lawrence Jones and Dr. V. J. Woolley,

lished later in Proceedings.
An interesting discussion followed.
NOTICE REGARDING THE PAPER "ON A SERIES OF
SITTINGS WITH MRS. OSBORNE LEONARD" BY
MISS RADCLYFFE-HALL AND UNA LADY TROU-
BRIDGE.
IT has recently come to the knowledge of Miss Radclyffe-
Hall and Una Lady Troubridge that an attempt is being
made by some person or persons to throw discredit upon the
veracity or accuracy of some of the statements of fact in the
paper on their sittings with Mrs. Osborne Leonard, which
was published by the S.P.R. in Part LXXVIIL, Vol. XXX.
of their Proceedings.
As this paper was written and published entirely with a
view to furnishing useful and interesting material for scientific
enquiry into Psychical Research, and as even the suspicion
of any inaccuracy, carelessness or mendacity being involved
in the compilation of such a paper must entirely deprive it
A2
34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FKB., 1921.
of any usefulness whatsoever, Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Una
Lady Troubridge invite any person who may have doubts
in the matter, or who may have heard such criticisms voiced,
to communicate direct with them at 7 Trevor Square,
London, S.W. 1, in order that they may set those doubts at
rest.
They will gladly arrange to see any enquirers in London,
with a view to answering questions, supplying any required
corroboration of the matter printed, and in many instances
they can and are quite willing to support such corroboration
by showing documentary evidence.

A METHOD OF INVESTIGATION INTO THOUGHT-
TRANSFERENCE.
By F. H. VAN LOON, M.D., O.B.E., and A. A. WEINBERG.
(Continued from the last Number of the Journal, January, 1921,
P. ff-}
VIII. November 26, 1919. 8 p.m. Dr. Weinberg's study.
Present : Miss Anny Fekken, percipient ;
Mrs. Fekken, Dr.
van Loon, Dr. Weinberg.
P. is not blindfolded, as it hinders her work considerably.
A "
Rubini-experiment
"
does not succeed entirely, as Miss
Fekken does not obey the impressions she gets from the conductor,
but now and then does what she thinks to be the aim of the
experiment. A second
"
Rubini-experiment
"
meets with much
more success, as Miss F., as she herself says, dismisses her own
thoughts entirely.
1. Thinking of a number. (5.)
Agent, P.'s mother, Mrs. Fekken, who is sitting at a distance
of 3 metres from P. Dr. v. L. is sitting between the two and takes
down notes. Dr. W. takes care that P. and the agent do not
communicate with each other by means of signals.
After 2 minutes P. says : "I am not quite sure. It keeps on
rolling. Think strongly on it for a moment, mother." After
3 minutes : "I am not quite sure, it may be 3, 4 or 5."
FEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 35
2. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, red. A shining piece
of red silk on a white ground. The silk is diamond-
shaped, thus :
After 3 minutes P. says :
"
Again and again I see the figure 5,
but without a definite colour." [Dr. v. L. had been thinking of
the 5 of the last experiment.]
After 5 minutes :
"
Now I saw quite a blaze of light, but I
am not quite certain of the colour." After 7 minutes :
"
I do
not know it
exactly yet ;
it is a light colour ;
now and then
I saw a flash of light. It is going to become a colour, I begin
to think ;
now it is gone again." (" What colour do you think
it is 1 ")
"
I do not know, it is light with something of a darker
colour on it."
"
Do you happen to see it in a definite shape ?
"
"
I see it in this shape, quite distinctly
"
; she draws it (right) :
"
The colour is light. Perhaps white ? I only see the shape,
and it is very light, so I think it is white."
3. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain.
Dr. v. L. pricks Dr. W. in his right finger. After 1J minutes :
"
I feel pain, I do not know if it is that. It is a pain in my
cheek, in my right molars." (" Is it a continuous pain ? ")
"
No,
it tears through it, again and again ;
it makes my cheek tingle,
yes, it is evidently pain in my right cheek."
4. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, salt.
After 1 minute P. says : "I think I know it
already, but
it seems to me as if I smell it rather than taste it." (" If you
know it, you may say it.") After 2 minutes :
"
No, I do not
know it yet. I think of something sometimes, but I am not
sure. I am thinking of peppermint, but I do not know yet
but I want to continue with it for a short time." After 7
minutes : "It pricks a little on my tongue."
"
Where ?
"
"In
the forepart of it, at the tip ;
not quite at the tip." (" Do you
taste anything more ? ")
"
No, only pricks in the point of the
tongue."
36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1921.
[Note. Dr. W. also felt it mostly as pricks on his tongue.]
5. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood, sadness.
Dr. W. is thinking of the misery in East-Europe, especially
in Vienna.
After 1 minute : "I feel as if I had a very heavy weight
in me. I do not know how." (" What mood is it ? ")
After 2 minutes : "I feel inclined to cry ;
if I indulge myself
I am sure to cry ." (" What mood ? ")
"
A sad mood."
[Note. When the experiment was over Miss F. said that she
was now quite passive and that she felt very much depressed.
Dr. W. had felt that he was in good contact with P. during
the experiment.]
6. Conditions as above. Two agents.
Impression to be conveyed : a colour, green.
The agents look at a triangle of green silk on a white ground.
P. draws successively :
She says :
"
The colour is light, but not a good colour ;
I see
two triangles on each other."
7. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood, anger.
After 1 minute P. says :
"
Now I cannot help seeing the
figure of the last experiment." After 3 minutes : "I think I
feel cheerful, but the feeling is not so distinct as just now."
After 5 minutes :
"
It is a feeling as if I am lifted upwards. My
throat begins to quiver ;
but I cannot define this sensation." Now
Dr. W. writes to Dr. v. Loon :
"
I am going to work myself up
into a fit of anger against P."
Dr. v. L. asks :
"
Do you feel anything ?
" "
Yes, just as if
I am hurried on, uneasy, it is not clear uneasy it is most
like fear it makes me uneasy I feel as if I have to get up
from my chair."
[Note. Dr. W. had changed the object of his anger, because
he could not work himself up into anger against another person.
IX. November 27, 1919. 7 p.m. Dr. W.'s study.
Present : Miss Anny Fekken, percipient ;
Mrs. Fekken, Dr.
v. Loon, Dr. Weinberg, Mrs. Weinberg.
A "
Rubini-experiment
"
fails, partly owing to the same cause
as the day before.
FEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 37
1. Conditions as on November 26, 1919. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a mood, hilarious. The agent
thinks of something ridiculous.
After 2 minutes P. says :
"
Very sad, just as yesterday." After
the experiment is over she says :
"
Great joy always makes me
feel sad."
2. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. van L.
Impression to be conveyed : a feeling of pain. Dr. Weinberg
is pulling at Dr. v. L.'s hair.
After 1 minute P. says : "I feel a pain, in both my hands,
rather a continuous pain, no pricks, over a large surface." She
points to a space on the inside of her wrist.
3. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed :
shape and colour ;
the following
figure cut out of white paper, about 12 cm. long, on
a black ground :
After 2 minutes Dr. v. L. asks : "Do you see anything ?
"
"
Yes, at first, a figure like a printed k, especially the lowest
angle ;
it is light, yes, and now I see it again
"
: she draws :
The two lines in the middle do not reach up to the top and
the foot.
After 5 minutes Dr. v. L. says :
"
Try to see it
again." After
6 minutes P. says :
"
Yes, I see about the same figure, but also
a round ball which is very light. [Owing to a defect in the
electric light a globe is put by the side of the agent's table,
so that the lighted globe is in the agent's range of vision.]
"
Yes, there I see the k again, in exactly the same shape."
4. Conditions as above. Two agents.
Dr. W. and Dr. v. L. look at a lighted candle at a distance
of about 1 metre.
(" Try and see something.") After 2 minutes P. says :
"
Yes,
still always the same, the k of just now, and also a slanting
shape." [She draws it.] After 3 minutes Dr. v. L. asks :
"
Can
you get rid of that k ?
" "
No, it remains continually the same."
38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1921.
[Note. Stopped on account of after-effect of the preceding
experiment.]
5. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, sugar.
After 2 minutes P. says : "It prickles a good deal on the
tongue." (" Is it a distinct taste ? ")
"
No, I cannot possibly
say what it is."
6. Conditions as above. Agent, Dr. W.
Impression to be conveyed : a taste, crystals of citric acid.
After 2 minutes P. says :
"
It is very bitter, I think." ("Is
it unpleasant ? ")
"
Yes, it is a horrible taste, but I do not
know what it is." (" Where do you taste it ? ") "On the
point of my tongue." (" And what do you notice then ? ")
"
Yes, it is a nasty taste, I do not know what it is like." After
6 minutes :
"
It is very strong. Can it be mustard ? or something
of the kind ? But it is not the same taste. Let us go on for
a moment no, I cannot get rid of the taste it prickles very
badly."
[Note. P. tastes a crystal and says :
"
Yes, that is it, it is
very sharp."]
7. Conditions as above.
Impression to be conveyed : a lighted candle.
After J minute P. says :
"
I see a large spot of light." (" What
shape ? ") "It has no definite shape it is a little rounded."
(" When you do see a shape, you will tell us.") After 5 minutes :
(" Did you see anything ? ") "No, nothing definite. Sometimes
it looks a little like a cross lying down." (" Is it coloured ? ")
"
Eather dark, darker than usual ;
it is very vague."
GENERAL SURVEY OF THE RESULTS.
We now wish to survey the results, and we had therefore better
take the experiments one by one and try to get a clear idea of the
result of each of them. For that purpose we shall each time put
together the results obtained by the same percipient and divide them
into two groups : one of emotional and one of non-emotional sensations.
We remark, however, beforehand, that quite clearly neither the primitive
arrangement of the first experiments nor the systematic arrangement
of the others offers any opportunity for fraud from the side of the
percipient. It has besides proved to be of essential value for the
reliability and easy observation of the experiments, that one of
the observers is at the same time an "
agent." By this measure
fraud from that side is quite excluded, and one has all the factors in
one's power that may influence the result of the experiment from the
FEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 39
agent's side. One can now get a clear idea of the sensations which
the various subjects chosen for transmission give to the agent, and
this enables him to find out the truth at once, if the telepathist tries
to explain away an unsuccessful result, when the experiment is over.
Farther on we shall have an opportunity of demonstrating this by
examples. It seems most desirable to us to criticize the experiments
in the following way :
(1) The parts of the experiments; and then
(2) The total result of the experiments.
As a rule the total result is formed by the sum of the results of
the parts of the experiment.
We have adopted three valuations :
Good which we denote by +
Wrong by -
Half good by
Experiments that cannot be counted, on account of a failure on
the side of the agent to perform his part, are denoted by 0.
The experiments are grouped in various classes under the dates upon
which they took place. The figures in round brackets refer to the
consecution of the experiments on any particular date (cf. detailed
record above).

one of our least developed organs of sense has proved to be the one
that is least fit. Owing to this fact, no doubt, former experimentalists
in thought-transference mostly occupied themselves with the transmission
of visual perceptions.
We also see in this result our opinion confirmed that the strongest
sensations are most adapted for extra-sensorial transmission. For this
reason it does not surprise us in the least, that the six
"
mood-experi-
ments
"
were, with the exception of one, all positive ones. Our hypo-
thesis is further supported by the fact that some negative results are
owing to the less emotional character of the experiments.
Of three experiments on sweet taste two (18, 54) were negative and
one (15) suffered from the after-effect of the preceding experiment on
sour taste, whereas on the other hand the four experiments on sour
taste (14, 23, 37, 55) were all positive. The negative result of Experi-
ment 27 must be ascribed to the fact that the sol. chinini was diluted
too much, owing to which the bitter taste was weak ;
in the experiment
(41) (mustard), which was considered to be negative, the disagreeable
sour quality of the taste was all right, but the experiment was very
likely too complicated. Of the sensations of feeling: warmth (19, 42),
fatigue (28), itching (8) were negative, whereas the pre-eminently emo-
tional feelings of pain (9, 12, 13, 22, 32, 38, 45, 51) were all positive.
The contents of consciousness that have to be transferred must be
able to excite all the interest, to draw all the attention of the agent ;
if they succeed in doing so a good result ceteris paribus is almost
certain, as is distinctly shown by Experiment 25. The strong impression
that a transmitted "
thought
"
makes on the percipient, owing to which
a following similar sort of experiment generally fails, also speaks for
our opinion.
The fact that shapes are transferred better than shades of colour
does not confute this ; our sense of colour is far less developed than
our faculty to distinguish shapes. In continuing these experiments
we shall accordingly have to take care that we take for the objects
of our experiments clearly distinguishable spectral colours.
Further, it is urgently necessary for the success of the experiment
that the percipient should detach himself entirely from his own thoughts ;
he must be "
passive," as it is usually termed. Only if he is quite
without thoughts will the transferred contents of consciousness be able
to come above the threshold of P.'s consciousness. Various failures
must be ascribed to the percipient's active thinking (see 19, 28, second
parts of 23 and 34, 46).
The less good results Miss Fekken obtained, as compared with the
other percipients, may partly be ascribed to her inferior
"
passivity.'*
Miss Fekken is accustomed to give
"
public seances," and owing to the
lack of phantasy in the public she is obliged to perform the same
experiments again and again. Thanks to this she gets a certain routine ;
she need not make herself very
"
passive," but has to act with wisdom
instead. This is evident from the fact that at her seances she never
failed, whereas all the "
Rubini-experiments
"
she performed at ours
were more or less unsuccessful, because she did not make herself sum-
4S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1921.
ciently passive, but tried to carry out her charge by active thinking.
She herself agreed with our opinion of her way of working.
To the difficulty this percipient had in detaching herself from her
thoughts is also to be ascribed the fact that the experiments took so
much time (generally 5-10 minutes), and especially the latent stadium
that preceded P.'s perceptions. (Note Expt. 31.)
It seems that P. gradually learns to distinguish the transferred stimuli
from the sensorial ones (cf. Expermient 28) ; at least Miss Fekken told
us that she succeeded in distinguishing the "
strange moods "
from
her own.
In two experiments visual impressions have been transmitted in a
double shape (e.g. Expts. 26 and 48) ; this may probably have something
to do with inversion and perversion of transferred sensations, which,
we too, often observed in our experiments.
Finally, we call attention to the interesting particularity that the
different telepathists do not get the same impressions of the various
sensations. This is especially proved by the experiments on colours.
Miss Fekken, as is also evident from experiments not yet published,
has not got the faculty of distinguishing transferred colours ;
she can
see white and she also gets impressions of light, but transmitted colours
are all alike to her :
they are all grey.
Mr. van Dam, on the contrary, is very sensitive to colours, in spite
of his being less able to distinguish blue from green, whereas Mr. Sriiit
is a better percipient in this respect than Miss Fekken, though he is
inferior to Mr. van Dam.
As for transferred shapes, Miss Fekken sees those as well as the other
telepathists.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.
It has been pointed out that to get some knowledge of the latent
qualities of the human mind it is first of all necessary that systematic
researches should be made. A scheme for these researches has been
proposed, and we have urged the necessity of these investigations being
made, if possible, by scientific people only, one of the investigators
acting as an agent and another one as an observer.
A first attempt to examine a certain subject systematically has been
made, and we have drawn the following conclusions :
1. An extra-sensorial perception of contents of consciousness is
possible.
2. Emotional processes of consciousness are more easily transmitted
than others, for :
3. Those sensations that make the strongest impression on the
agent are most easily transferred.
4. In accordance with this, the impressions received by the best
developed organs of sense are very likely transmitted most
easily.
5. Visual impressions may be seen double.
FEB., 1921. Method of Investigation into Thought-Transference. 49
6. It is necessary for the transference of thoughts that the con.
sciousness of the percipient be as diffuse as possible.
7. The faculty to perceive thoughts is not developed in the same
way in the various "
telepathists."
CORRESPONDENCE.
I. ON "
THE FAITH OF A QUAKER."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, I am greatly indebted to your reviewer for his
friendly review of my book, The Faith of a Quaker. But his
comments on my use of the Subliminal as the vehicle of Divine
influence, which is my central idea, raise a subject which, I think,
is of sufficient interest to us psychical researchers to merit a
further letter.
He agrees, I am glad to see, with my view of the continuity
of the human and divine consciousness. But he goes on :
"
That
the subliminal influx into the individual mind is the current of
divine inspiration more than of mundane monitions or even of
evil suggestions is rendered most unlikely by the fact that a
man's individuality is the highest and most fateful self of him,
while the subliminal consciousness is that part of his self which
is least his own and is shared with his fellows."
I would not myself use the word
"
more
"
in this connection.
The great unmapped subliminal region doubtless contains all the
above. I only hold that among it's
many paths, the path to
God is there. Readers of Myers need not be reminded of the
purple end of his spectrum, and of his chapters on the Daimon
of Socrates and the Voices of Joan of Arc. I am with him
there.
It is actually because the man's
"
individuality," by which
your reviewer evidently means his supraliminal self, is the latest
product of his evolution, the most elaborate, the most individually
characteristic (I doubt the usefulness of the word
"
highest ")
that I turn to the subliminal as the organ of his Religion. For
Religion is primitive, like hunger and sex ;
it must have been
there since man could be called human. One would not look
for it among the pinnacles, but among the foundations, among
what is common to men. Qualities are not retrograde or evil
because they are primitive. Sex and strife and the will to live
50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1021.
and the religious sense and the sense of the beautiful have all
been purified and are, we hope, to be further purified, from glory
to glory. But they all have a subliminal foundation. To work
this idea out in detail was one purpose of my book, a purpose
which has no denominational significance.
Whilst writing may I briefly add that your reviewer has not caught
my view on non-resistance quite correctly. I should resist both
"
a wild beast and a murderous fellow man." But it is a far
cry from that to a war for the balance of power and for com-
mercial expansion ;
and there are sundry milestones on the way
where consciences may halt. The point is treated at length in
12 of my chapter on War, pp. 367-371.
JOHN W. GRAHAM.
II. ON "
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH FOR THE PLAIN MAN."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, Will you permit me to thank the reviewer of Psychical
Research for the Plain Man for his words of commendation ;
and, at the same time, to comment on some of his criticisms ?
(See pages 259, 260, Journal, December, 1920.)
G. E. W. regrets my omission to deal with
"
the investigation
of sensitives purporting to produce
'
physical
'
or
'
materialization
'
phenomena." I made the omission because I did not find in the
Proceedings or Journal cases sufficiently evidential to be set before
a plain man. But I considered the chapter on Poltergeists
afforded evidences that physical phenomena are produced ; and I
suggested that they are produced by semi-physical emanations
from the young mediums ;
and that this same semi-physical
power is the means by which Miss Goligher moved tables, etc.,
in co-operation with Dr. Crawford. (Psychical Research for the
Plain Man, pages 265, 266.) G. E. W. gives no reason for
considering the reference to Miss Goligher in this connection
"
inappropriate."
As regards my omission to make reference to Mrs. Piper and
Mrs. Leonard, I would say the Piper-phenomena literature is so
vast, that to deal with it in a short chapter appeared to me to
be absolutely impossible. My book was completed before Miss
Radclyffe-Hall's well-balanced and judicious report on seances with
Mrs. Leonard was published, or I think I should have broken my
FEB., 1921. Correspondence. 51
rule against cases connected with mediums who receive payment,
as I consider it has important bearings on two of the few original
theories I have ventured to set forth in my book. I have
suggested that mediums are able to describe in minute detail
the bodily appearance and gestures of deceased persons, by seeing
visions of such persons in their former earthly environment,
together possibly with relatives still surviving ;
and that this
would account for the fact that mediums often profess uncertainty
whether the person seen is alive or dead. (See pages 98 and 99
of Psychical Research for the Plain Man.) To this theory the
report on Mrs. Leonard's seances lends some support, as Feda
constantly says of the communicator
"
She is showing Feda some-
thing like a wall . . . there looks to Feda to be a kind of valley
. . . Feda thinks she shows the left side . . .
you see its like a
negative to Feda what she shows," etc. etc. etc.
Another theory I have ventured to set forth in the book is that
Nelly, Mrs. Thompson's
'
control,' was a resuscitation of Mrs.
Thompson herself as a child. Now I believe
"
Feda
"
Mrs.
Leonard's
"
control
"
is .supposed to be an adult Eastern. But
the impression I gain of her is that she might be a little English
girl a possible resuscitation of Mrs. Leonard as a child. It
would be very interesting if Mr. Piddington, who seems to have
known and appreciated Nelly better than anyone else, would
give us his views on this suggestion which will be found worked
out rather more fully on page 110 of Psychical Research for the
Plain Man.

REVIEW.
The Church and Psychical Research : a Layman's View. By
GEORGE E. WRIGHT. Pp. 147. (Kegan Paul. 3s. 6d.)
MY first thought on reading Mr. Wright's work was
"
This is a
very sensible little book ;
I hope that a great many of the
Clergy will read it." Further reflection has only served to
confirm this opinion. It is very desirable that the clergy, of all
classes of the community, should hold enlightened views about
Psychical Research and should regard it as at least a potential
ally and not a snare of the Evil One,
52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1921.
Books of this kind are far better calculated to bring this about
than the less balanced outpourings of enthusiastic Spiritualists,
who seldom present the real evidence for survival at all.
Mr. Wright does not profess to make any fresh contribution
to the subject, but he writes with a moderation and a knowledge
of facts which are all too rarely found in books intended for
popular consumption. His
"
newspaper-cutting
"
analogy to the
principles of
"
cross-correspondence
"
is particularly happy and
likely to help many people to an understanding of this very
important but little appreciated type of evidence.
The book can be cordially recommended to members of the
Society who may be asked by clerical, or indeed lay friends, for
a short but reliable introduction to the subject.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1920.
THE principal piece of research work carried out by the Society
during the past year has been an enquiry into the phenomena
of the medium "
Eva C." In the Annual Report for the
year 1919 reference was made to this intended enquiry, which
was carried out during the spring and early summer of 1920,
a special committee having been appointed by the Council for
this purpose. The medium and her friend Madame Bisson spent a
little over two months in this country at the invitation of the
Society and during that time 40 sittings were held, of which
27 were negative. At the remaining 13 sittings phenomena
were observed of the type usually associated with Eva C.'s
mediumship. The phenomena, however, even at the best sittings
were small and scanty compared with those observed elsewhere,
e.g., by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, and described in his book,
of which an English translation has recently appeared.
A report of these observations has been drawn up by the
Committee, part of which was read at a Private Meeting of
the Society on December 9th last. It is hoped that the
full report will be published later in Proceedings.
The Committee were fortunate enough to secure the assistance of
Mr. E. J. Dingwall, a Member of the Society, both in observing the
phenomena and in drafting the report upon them. Mr. Dingwall
has contributed to this report a chapter entitled
"
The Hypothesis
of Fraud," in which he discusses the question of what assumptions
this hypothesis entails and to what extent it can reasonably be
supposed to account for the phenomena observed. For this
task Mr. Dingwall is especially fitted by his wide knowledge
(based on practical experience) of the various tricks to which
illusionists have recourse. Mr. Dingwall is shortly proceeding to
America as Research Officer on Physical Phenomena to the
American S.P.R., so that we shall lose his services here for the
present.
Although
" Eva C." does not make any charge for her sittings,
an investigation of this sort necessarily entails heavy expendi-
ture. As is mentioned above, Madame Bisson and
"
Eva
C." were the guests of the Society for several weeks, and
there were various other expenses also. The enquiry has cost
MARCH, 1921. Report of the Council for the Year. 55
the Society in all about 247, exclusive of the further cost
to be entailed in publishing the Committee's Report.
The cost of printing continues to be very heavy and there
appears to be no prospect at present of any diminution. The
payments for printing during 1920 amounted, as is shown in the
Statement of Accounts, to 824, as compared with 633 in 1919
and 378 in 1918. Some idea of the increase in the relative
cost of printing can be derived from the fact that whereas the
average cost per page of the Proceedings was about 13s. during
the five years preceding the War, 1909-1913, the average
cost per page in 1920 was about 1 6s. Od., that is to say,
twice as much.
A considerable number of new books have been added to
the Library during the year. The Council feel it to be of
much importance that so far as possible the Library should
be kept up to date, and Members are asked to send to the
Secretary any suggestions they may wish to make with regard
to the purchase of books. Since, however, the number of
books published upon subjects which have a bearing upon
psychical research is now very large, it is evidently impossible
to purchase all of them, and therefore only those can be
chosen which seem likely to be of permanent value, or for*
which there appears to be a considerable demand amongst our
members.
Among minor experiments conducted at the Rooms of the
Society during 1920, were two Sittings with the professional
clairvoyant, Mr. Sutton. Some thirty or forty members
attended one or other of these Sittings, but the results obtained
at them were unfortunately of no evidential value.
We have endeavoured during the past year to enquire into
the phenomena of Mr. Hope, the well-known
"
spirit -photo-
grapher." But although two or three individual Members of
Council have been able to obtain a sitting, Mr. Hope does
not seem willing to take part in an official enquiry by the
Society under test conditions.
The President of the Society during the past year has been
Dr. W. M'Dougall, who gave his Presidential Address in July.
As he pointed out on that occasion, although the Society has
boasted many leading men of science among its Members,
few of them have been psychologists ;
and we are the more
A2
56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.
fortunate in having had the active co-operation of so dis-
tinguished a psychologist as Dr. M'Dougall. Although he is
now resident in America, having been appointed as Head of
the Psychological Department at Harvard, a position once
occupied by William James, Dr. M'Dougall has not lost his
interest in our work and has consented to accept nomination
for the Presidency during the current year. It is to be
hoped that his presence at Harvard may stimulate a further
interest there in psychical research.
The Council have to record with great regret that Mr.
J. G. Piddington has resigned the honorary treasurership. He
only undertook the post temporarily on the resignation of
Mr. H. Arthur Smith in 1917, so that we have been fortunate
in his retaining the office so long. The Council feel they may
also congratulate the Society on having secured Mr. W. H.
Salter as his successor.
A welcome addition to the Officers of the Society is Dr.
V. J. Woolley who has consented to be Joint Honorary
Secretary with Mrs. Sidgwick.
Mr. Piddington has been appointed a Vice-President of
the Society. Sir J. J. Thomson, who retires in rotation
'from the Council and does not offer himself for re-election
because he is unable to attend its Meetings, has also con-
sented to be nominated as a Vice-President.
The Society has during the year suffered the loss through
death of one of its Vice-Presidents who had held the office
for more than twenty years Professor J. H. Hyslop, who was
also President of the American Society for Psychical Research.
Professor Hyslop was one of the most zealous and industrious
workers engaged in Psychical Eesearch and was for many
years not only the President and Secretary, but in fact
the mainstay of the American Society. He contributed to
our own Proceedings, before the American Branch became
an independent society, a volume (Vol. XVI.) on Mrs. Piper
which contains careful observation and, in an appendix, an
account of some interesting experiments on the "
Identification
of Personality
"
over a telephone.
Death has also deprived us of a Corresponding Member
Professor Flournoy of Geneva, who carried through the long
series of observations and experiments on Helene Smith
MARCH, 1921.
Report of the Council for the Year. 57
chiefly upon her impersonations in the hypnotic state, but
also upon her automatic writing and published the results
in his book Des Indes a la Planete Mars.
The present Report is the first which has been drawn up
by the Council since there has been any opportunity of
observing the effect upon the Society's membership and
financial position of the decision, come to in January 1920,
to suspend the election of new Associates. In view of this
decision, and in view also of the fact that many people are
now finding it necessary to exercise a more strict economy,
an increase in the membership was not to be expected.
The actual result, which shows a net decrease of only twelve,
as may be seen from the table given below, must be regarded as
satisfactory :

The loss during the past year from resignations and failure
to renew subscriptions is unusually large, 98, as compared
with 62 in 1919. But in very few cases, so far as we have
been informed, has resignation been due to a diminution of
interest in the work of the Society, and in many instances
Members have explained that the need for retrenchment in
personal expenditure is their reason for resigning.
As regards the amount received in subscriptions, the position
of the Society has been strengthened ;
for whereas the majority
of those who for one reason or another have ceased to sub-
scribe were Associates, paying one guinea a year, all those
who have been elected are Members, paying two guineas.
And, moreover, in the course of the past year 24 Associates
58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.
have become Members. The Council take this opportunity
of again expressing their thanks to these Members for their
welcome support.
The total membership of the Society now stands at 1302,
of whom 463 are Members and 839 Associates.
The amount received from the sale of publications at half
price to Members and Associates has been smaller than last
year, mainly owing to a decrease in the sale of complete sets
of Proceedings. On the other hand the amount received from
sales to the general public has been unusually large, 108 13s.
8d. as compared with 49 16s. Od. in 1919. This increase is
partly accounted for by the increase in prices, but it is also
due to larger sales. There continues to be a steady demand
for Part LXXIII. (Mr. G. W. Balfour's paper on
"
The Ear
of Dionysius "), and we have further evidence of the interest
which this paper has aroused in the fact that Mr. Henry Holt,
the well-known New York publisher, has, with the permission
of the Council, published it in book-form in America.
We welcome the formation of the Glasgow Society for
Psychical Research under the Presidency of Mr. A. J. Balfour,
O.M., F.R.S., and having upon its Council one of our own
Council-Members, Sir George Beilby, F.R.S., and Professor
W. Macneile Dixon.
We understand that a Dutch Society for Psychical Research has
recently been formed, two members of which, Dr. van Loon,
O.B.E., and Dr. Weinberg, are members of our own Society
also, and have sent us a report of some experiments in thought
transference, which is printed in the last two Journals (January
and February, 1921). We welcome their co-operation and
we hope that they and other members of the Dutch Society
will be able to continue their researches.
Public interest in psychical research in this country continues
to be manifested in various ways. It not infrequently happens
that the Secretary is asked by local clubs and debating
Societies to provide a lecturer, and a rather unusually large
number of such requests have been received during the past
year. Whenever it was possible the request has been complied
with, in order to stimulate a scientific interest in the subject,
and the Council feel that the Society is indebted to those of
its Members who have consented to address Meetings.
MARCH, 1921. Report of the Council for the Year. 59
At the Conference of Bishops, held at Lambeth Palace in
July 1920, a discussion on spiritualism took place. In the
report of the Conference, subsequently published, a sharp
distinction was drawn between "
Spiritualism
"
regarded as a
religion on the one hand, and on the other, scientific research
into psychical problems, such as the Society undertakes. As
regards scientific research the report of the Conference is
sympathetic, and we are glad to find ourselves on this point
at one with its Members.
A new publication, entitled The Psychic Research Quarterly,
made its first appearance in July, 1920, under the editorship
of Mr. Whately Smith. Its purpose is to set forth and
discuss the problems of psychical research in a scientific spirit,
but in a more popular form than is possible in our Proceedings.
We believe that this publication is likely to do useful work,
and we wish it all success.
The output of Proceedings during 1920 has been rather
small owing to the unavoidable delay in publishing certain
papers which have been read at Meetings. It is hoped that
two of these papers will appear shortly.
The number of Meetings held during the year for the reading
of papers has been six.

NOTICE CONCERNING THE BELFAST CIRCLE.
IT is probably known to many members of the Society for
Psychical Research that the prolonged experiments conducted
by the late Dr. W. J. Crawford on the mediumship of Miss
K.. Golligher of Belfast were supported financially by a gentle-
man who wishes to remain anonymous and whom I will
allude to as Mr. X.
Since Dr. Crawford's lamented death, Mr. X. has been
anxious that his work should be continued by some suitable
investigator, and several months ago invited through me the
co-operation of the Council of the Society in finding such a
researcher, but up to the present without success. Mr. X..
did not wish any general announcement of the vacancy to be
made, so that I have not been able to go outside the small
circle of those known personally to the members of the Council.
He has now decided to make his offer public, and some
members may have seen the concluding paragraph of the
article by Mr. F. M'C. Stephenson in the issue of Light for
March 5th in which the position is offered . For the sake of
those members who may not see it, and in view of the im-
portance of the investigation, I think that the offer should
now be brought to the notice of all members of the
Society.
The essential conditions and qualifications are as follows :
1. The person appointed must reside in Belfast for at
least a year.
2. He or she must have an adequate knowledge of chemical
and physical science. No definite standard has been
formulated, but I should estimate that the standard
of the medical curriculum would be an absolute
minimum, and a higher one would be extremely
desirable.
3. He or she must have an aptitude for original investi-
gation, and must also possess the social qualities
which are necessary to maintain harmony and good
feeling in the circle.
There are other conditions as to the conduct of seances and
publication of results which I need not enter into here. It-
will readily be seen that the position is . not an easy one to-
MARCH, 1921. Notice concerning the Belfast Circle. 63
fill, but there should be in the Society some one or more
suitable candidates. The work will be paid, and anyone who
undertakes it will have ample leisure to pursue other studies
if (as is very desirable) they should care to do so. Anyone
who wishes to apply for the position can do so either to me
at the office of the Society, 20 Hanover Square, London, W.,
or to Mr. Stephenson at the office of Light, and I shall be
pleased to give further particulars to any members who may
be interested. V. J. WOOLLEY.
TESTIMONY TO A CHILD'S IMPRESSION OF FAIRIES.
BY SIR OLIVER LODGE.
SOME months ago I was privately shown a pair of incredible
photographs supposed to be taken by children in Yorkshire.1
About the same time a lady well known to us, and called
by my children
"
Woodie," was on a visit, and told me that
a friend of hers, who was apparently possessed of psychic
faculties, had a vivid recollection of having been able as a
child to
"
see
"
something of the same kind, and gave me
this lady's name and address. Whatever may be the psychical
significance of so curious an impression, I thought it desirable
to get her testimony recorded in detail before any publication,
of the photographs, and before she had heard anything about
them. So I wrote an enquiry to this lady, whom I will here
call Mrs. Alleyne a stranger to me but well known to my
friend and she was good enough to reply promptly and

Letter from Mrs. Alleyne to Sir Oliver Lodge.
August IQth, 1920.
You ask me to tell you about the
"
Fairies
"
I saw in my
childhood.
I have always been conscious of other forms of spirit life
besides our own. I can remember when I was five years of age
before I could read fairy tales (and we were not told any) slipping
out of bed at dawn and going into the garden to talk with the
fairies, it was when I could be alone and away from my brothers
1

and sisters that I felt and saw them. They were always beautiful,
never old, not very young, just without age.
Sometimes as a child I would at night suddenly awake feeling
rigid with fright, and I used at once to send a call to the fairies
to come to me, and first I would hear faint music growing louder
and louder till my room was filled with music and from every
side little fairies came and glided along the coverlet of my bed
and all my fear was turned to joy, and they put me to sleep
again. They have nearly always been accompanied by music.
Since I have grown up I have still seen the Fairies, but the
conditions must be right. A short time ago I was on the Downs
near here in the morning and it was very still and quiet and
no one about, and as I sat in the grass I felt the conditions
change I became aware of faculties which normally I have not
at all. I could hear each little blade of grass vibrating and
there was harmony in every note, I could see an aura to every
flower and the fairies were there in colours like the auras. I
seemed to be conscious of being in quite a new world, my material
body was forgotten. I felt in an inner world of colour, music,
and scent, and perfect peace and happiness. I do not know
how long I felt and saw this, as the approach of a shepherd
broke the spell, and all was just the Downs again.
As a child I did not talk much about the Fairies, but I never
realised that other people didn't see them. I thought my own
brothers and sisters too noisy to see them.
I have often known them to come to my aid when in childish
difficulties, but I never mixed the Fairies up with the human
spirits which I often saw.
Another thing which may interest you is that as a child I
could see in the dark ;
I used to think the Fairies gave me a
blue light because there was no darkness for me, I could see
a blue light which showed things to me, not a diffused light,
but a guiding light which I thought the Fairies brought for me,
but when awake at night in bed the blue light grew more general
and I saw them in it. I was always conscious of each Fairy
vibrating and the music coming from them.
I have also seen in the woodlands
"
Brownies," but strange
to say I have never got in touch with them, they have taken no
notice of me and I have not known how to attract them. These
Brownies are much bigger than Fairies and denser. I have

never seen them in open spaces, only in Woodlands, and I have
heard no music those times.
[CELIA ALLEYNE].
I then wrote again a letter of which the following is a
copy :
Copy of further enquiry from 0. J. L. to Mrs. Alleyne.
August 20th, 1920.
It is very good of you to have taken the trouble to answer
my question so clearly and explicitly, especially as I understand
that at the present time you are very busy. If you are still
occupied, pray do not answer this further enquiry until it is
quite convenient. I hardly expect that you will be able to
answer it in a manner satisfactory to sceptics :
among which
group I must include myself.
It is obvious that if your experiences correspond with objective
reality they are most important, but on the other hand it is very
difficult to discriminate between objective and subjective impres-
sions ;
hence I must tell you what impression your letter would
make upon a sceptic. He would say that at the time of those
experiences you were dreaming, and probably either asleep or
dozing. For instance, you speak of
"
slipping out of bed at
dawn and going into the garden
"
: is there any guarantee or
proof that you actually did that ? Was not the house locked
up ? Did you undo the bolts ? Were you ever discovered in
these nocturnal excursions ? And can you adduce any outward
and visible sign that they really occurred ?
You know how many people have an impression that they are
able to float or fly or soar or hover over the ground without
much muscular exertion ;
and some people have imagined this so
vividly that it is difficult to convince them indeed they find it
difficult to convince themselves that they have not really done so.
In recounting your second kind of experience you speak of
awaking at night in a state of fright and soothing yourself asleep
again by your visions : the sceptic would certainly say that you
were in all probability only dreaming that you wakened and
got to sleep again.
Your third class of experience, lying in the grass when it was
still and quiet, and becoming aware of extra faculties until dis-
turbed by a shepherd, reads strongly as if you had been dozing.
66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.
I rather think that the blue light of which you also speak would
be accounted for in the same way.
Now my question is, what answer could you make to these
contentions, beyond mere assertion of their falsity ? And can
you adduce any actual proof of reality underlying your undoubted
mental states ?
I am told that you can still see what may be called spirits
or phantasms, and have in fact the clairvoyant faculty fairly well
developed. I am far from denying the existence of this faculty,
but it is a phenomenon that requires careful study and much
elucidation. Hence anything that throws light upon it is of value.
Returning now to the beginning, and writing as if I had
admitted that the creatures you saw and called Fairies have a
real existence, can you remember what kind of size they were ?
What they wore ? And what they were doing ? Were they>
for instance, winged creatures ? or had they any other peculiar-
ities to which you can testify ? I ask this because I am in
touch with other evidence in favour of certain children to-day
seeing what they call Fairies, and likewise Brownies. If they
are real beings the visions of them by different people ought to
correspond ; whereas, if they are creatures of the imagination,,
each person would be able to create a world of his or her own.
Let me make it clear that I do not for a moment question
your possession of unusual psychic faculties ;
it seems to me
quite likely that you are occasionally in touch with other intelli-
gences, and can be made the channel for genuine information
derived from them, either telepathically or in some other way.
But these intelligences will not usually be bodily dwellers on this,
planet. Scepticism becomes pronounced when the existence of a
race of creatures living on this planet but quite unknown to
biology, are asserted to have a real and not a visionary existence.
Please understand that I am not denying the fact (for in that
I hold my judgment in suspense), but I am pointing out to you.
the urgent need for strong and convincing evidence before asser-
tions of that kind can be assimilated or even contemplated by
Science. OLIVER LODGE.

any little personal information that is within my power to do.

Testimony to a Child's Impression of Fairies. 67
Referring to my being asleep as a child and dreaming
"
Fairies."
I must tell you that I have been found in the garden in the
early morning wet through with the dew, and severely scolded
by my mother for slipping out. I can well remember standing
on a hall chair to unfasten the bolt and the ugly squeak it made,
which I hated so much, not for fear of waking up the household
but because
"
ugly noises frightened away the fairies
"
and I
thought they would hear. It had to be still and quiet or I
could not see them.
As to when I woke at night in a state of fright I used some-
times to get out of bed, and not having a key to my door,
fix a piece of string from the handle to a nail in the framework
of the door, so that anyone opening it to enter would only push
it open a few inches. I think I was afraid of something coming
through the door, but I don't know what. (The nursemaid in
the morning used to tease me about the string.) When I re-
turned to bed I was full of expectancy for the coming of the
"
fairies," not asleep at all, I only went to sleep after they came
to soothe me.
You ask about size. My impression is from four to six inches ;
they vary, never beyond six inches.
Concerning clothing not any they appeared to me iridescent,
like a dragon-fly's wing, many colours, only instead of being a
solid whole like the fly's wing, they were visible vibrating
particles, which gave out a musical sound, and took shape and
form, but without the appearance of any actual sex.
I have seen a
"
fairy
"
when I have been walking with my
husband, but this was only once, it was in a meadow field in
spring, and it was gliding just above the flowers. I have never
noticed any wings, and you can see through them, there is no
bodily, substance.
The
"
Brownies
"
I also saw when I was with a friend, and
tried to point them out, but he could not see them ; they appeared
quite a foot in height, and had clothed bodies and were very
busy talking to each other, though I could not hear them.
I think perhaps I am inclined to have an extra vision to
most people. I will relate a small incident in connection with
"
Woodie," as she will be able to speak of it for herself. About
a month ago a Miss [Moore] (pseudonym) and myself were
talking in the sitting room, which looks on to a path leading
68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921,
from the garden gate to a porch. I was expecting
"
Woodie
" L
to come to dinner in about an hour's time, and had just remarked
to my friends, that "we should be quite undisturbed until then
' y
when on looking out of the window (it was a bright sunny
evening), I saw
'"'
Woodie
"
open the garden gate and come up
to the porch, and I remarked to Miss Moore,
"
Why, here is
Woodie !
"
She heard the gate latch 2
but did not see her, being away from
the window ;
I also remarked,
"
Woodie has a new coat on,"
and we went out into the hall to meet her. Not finding her
there we looked all over for her, convinced that she had come
in. We had gone into the garden to look there, when "
Woodie
''
did arrive and we exclaimed
"
Why did you go out again ?
' r
To which she replied that she had only just come ;
but she was
wearing what was a new coat to me, for I had not seen it before,
and it was the one I saw her enter the gate in.
I find this kind of thing is very often happening. I see people
distinctly just before meeting them.
I only mention this because my friend Miss Moore felt sure
too that "Woodie "
had come in.
Dr. Vanstone was lecturing down here some few months ago
he is quite a stranger to me, but as I sat amongst the audience
I told my husband that I could see an old lady standing by
Dr. Vanstone, with a white cap on and an ebony stick in her
hand. My husband suggested that after the lecture, we should
wait and ask Dr. Vanstone if he knew anyone answering the
description. Dr. Vanstone at once replied,
"
You have described
my Mother, whom I felt was near me throughout the lecture.
She always wore a cap and carried that stick."
These are two very small incidents but as each has a tangible
"
something
"
at the back of it, I can't help thinking that the
"
fairies
"
are not little creatures of the imagination only.
I am very ignorant, but could they possibly be
"
musical
vibrations
"
which I see and which my mind gives form to ?
I really do not know what I am talking about when I suggest
this, but I am sure there is something there with movement,
colour, and sound, which gives happiness.

The real names of these ladies and of Mrs. Alleyne are known to the
S.P.R.

MARCH, 1921, Testimony to a Child's Impression of Fairies. 69
I have had remarkable (to me) experience in other spheres at
night, when my spirit travels forth, but I find it so extremely
difficult to put the experiences into mere words, and as they are
entirely without proof they will not be of the same interest to
the investigator.
I am afraid I have not been of much use to you in this letter,,
but I have just stated things as I see them.
I am really rather an active sort of person and not in the
least inclined to sleep or doze during the daytime, I have never
known myself do it. All my friends call me extremely practical f
Believe me I am only too pleased to do any little thing I
can. [CELIA ALLEYNE].
I have received the two following statements confirming
one of the episodes related by Mrs. Alleyne in the above
letter :
I. Confirmatory Statement from Miss Moore.
I was talking to Mrs. A. in her drawing room one evening,
We expected to be alone for some time. When I had been there
about five minutes, she heard the gate click and looking round
saw W. walking up the path to the front door. (I do not re-
member hearing the gate click and from where I was sitting
I could not see the path.) Mrs. A. jumped up saying
"
Here
conies W.," and mentioned that she was wearing a new coat.
We went to the front door to meet her and found no one there.
We called her and after looking for her in the house and garden
we sat down again wondering what had become of her, and
Mrs. A. again mentioned the clothes she was wearing. About
five minutes after Mrs. A. had seen her W. arrived, wearing a
coat that was new to Mrs. A. She greeted her with,
"
Why did
you run away ?
"
W. said,
"
What do you mean ? I have walked
straight here." M. D. [MOORE].
II. Confirmatory Statement from
"
Woodie."
I remember the incident referred to. C. A. was expecting me
up to dinner, but when I arrived I was greeted by :
"
Why did
you go away again just now ? I saw you come in at the gate
five minutes ago." I had to say that that was my first appear-
ance. She seemed surprised, and said,
"
I felt so sure you had
come that I went to the door to meet you, you were wearing
that new coat. When I saw you come in at the gate, not
70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MARCH, 1921.
finding you, M. and I went into the garden (which is at the
back) calling for you."
She must have been seeing me psychically ;
she certainly
seems to have this faculty, for she has told me several times
of events happening before they
"
actually
"
occur.
WOODIE.
NOTE BY SIR OLIVER LODGE IN SUPPLEMENT
TO THE ABOVE COMMUNICATION.
Photographs alleged to be of fairies have been published, with the
apparent sanction of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in the Strand Magazine
for December, 1920, and March, 1921. Also an admittedly faked
photograph has appeared in the Yorkshire Observer for Thursday,
March 10th, 1921.
Photographic evidence always seems to me particularly unsatisfactory,
because methods of faking are numerous. Many people imagine that
they saw fairies in childhood, without any question or thought of
photography ;
and to explain Sir Arthur's photographs in a rational
manner, without accusation of fraud, the simplest hypothesis would
seem to be that an imaginative child, playing the game of make-
believe, might sometimes innocently assist the imagination of her
playmates by figures designed by herself, if she had the skill, and
that these figures might subsequently get photographed. Without
closing our minds, this is the present position of myself and my
collaborator, Mr. J. Arthur Hill, in connexion with this matter.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF PSYCHO-
DYNAMIC PHENOMENA.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, The letter contributed by Mr. G. E. Wright to the
December issue of the Journal on the subject of the experimental
investigation of psycho-dynamic phenomena is indeed a welcome
indication of the interest that is taken by members and associates
of the Society in the somewhat dry technicalities involved in
telekinetic experiments.
Mr. Wright appears to me to lay greater stress upon the
opinions of critics than is justified by their remarks. It is true
MARCH, 1921.

that Poolmore said that Eusapia could have done everything at
the Naples sittings if she could have freed an arm or a leg, but
he does not explain how, for instance, the curtain could have
been blown out if those limbs had been free. When Mr. Wright
says that even under unsatisfactory conditions of control we may
surely assume that there could be no doubt as to whether the
sensitive was seated or not, I cannot agree with him. I do
not know what he means by
"
unsatisfactory," but in absolute
darkness it seems sometimes quite impossible to know what the
medium is doing even when being held. Mr. Wright will call
to mind the extremely important case of Miss Burton who was
able to move different parts of her body and lean far over the
table in trance in a way which was apparently quite impossible
for her to do in her normal condition. Your correspondent
rather glosses over the difficulty when he says,
"
the Control
apart from initial and final examinations need not go beyond
the assurance that the sensitive does not move, or move from,
her chair, an assurance easily obtained even in darkness."
With regard to his second point I agree that the position of
every article used should be accurately recorded before and after
each seance. As to the imitation seance, little could, I think,
be gained from such a procedure, since how could the experi-
menters duplicate exactly the stretchings and muscular con-
tortions of the medium ? Of course if an object was found to
have been moved at about eight feet off, then perhaps it would
be safe to assume that the medium's limbs had not produced the
phenomenon unaided, and some other hypothesis might have to
be adopted. Generally speaking, if the light is good enough to
see the hands and feet of the medium, then the genuine or
fraudulent character of these phenomena can be determined by
competent investigators without very great difficulty. In a dim
light the difficulty naturally increases, and in complete darkness
little certainty can ever be attained unless the objects moved are
some considerable distance from the medium. As Mr. Wright
points out, if telekinetic extensions exist, they probably do not
extend more than a short distance beyond the extremities from
the sensitive and in darkness it is impossible to say how far
abnormal stretchings and movements on the part of the medium
may be responsible for the shifting of objects occurring at a
distance which, under normal conditions, would be out of reach
of the sensitive. The experiments with Miss Burton (which I
recommend Mr. Wright to read over again carefully) have put
investigators on their guard when dealing with these phenomena,
and the results obtained have added further difficulties to a
subject already strewn with many a pitfall.

REVIEW.
Studies in Dreams. By Mrs. H. 0. ARNOLD FORSTER. Geo. Allen &
Unwin Ltd. 8s. 6d. net.
This book is an account of the dreams experienced by the
writer who claims to have developed by practice a notable degree
of dream-control, as well as a remarkably complete memory
of her dream-experiences. The dream-control, however, is chiefly
of a negative kind. By repeating to herself while awake the
formula
"
Remember this is a dream. You are to dream no
longer," she is able to cut short any dream which causes her
distress, since these words return to her mind even while dreaming.
She does not at present seem able to control her dreams to the
extent of bringing about a pleasurable dream-experience, though in
the case of flying dreams she is able to prolong her flight by
the use of a similar formula about the law of gravitation.
As regards the causation of dreams, she rejects Freud's view
that every dream represents symbolically the fulfilment of a
repressed desire, though it is not very clear what she would put
in place of it, and the fact that she finds that certain simple
dreams give her on waking a quite disproportionate feeling of
happiness and contentment seems to show that her dreams arise
from deeper strata of her mind than she has at present succeeded
in probing. From the point of view of the Society, the most
important chapters are those dealing with the
"
Borderland
State
"
between sleeping and waking. This is divided into two
stages, an earlier and a later, and it is in the earlier stage alone
that she considers that genuinely supernormal experiences may
occur, as well as a great increase in the power of certain normal
mental faculties.
"
At such moments," she writes,
"
the answer
to some difficult question which has baffled our intelligence by
day may flash into the mind, appearing to come to us from
without rather than from within," and she compares this state
with the ecstasy of mystics and with the early stage of hypnosis.
The later stage of the borderland state is not associated with
increased mental faculties but with an apparent hyperaesthesia
of certain senses, including curiously enough the sense of smell.
This hyperaesthesia is accompanied or followed by the so-called
hypnagogic hallucinations which have been so often described,
and consist of pictures or faces which appear just before con-
sciousness is lost. These visions the writer considers are of the
same nature as dreams and like dreams are not related to any
external source, while the experiences of the early borderland
state convey a
"
certainty that they come from without, not
from within."
The clearness of the author's memory of her dreams and
borderland states makes the book a very valuable contribution to
our knowledge, while the style of her writing makes it an
unusual delight to read. V. J. W.

CASES.
L. 1229. A TELEPATHIC DREAM.
THE following case of a dream which appears to have had a
telepathic origin has reached us through Sir Oliver Lodge.
The names and addresses of the persons concerned are known
to the Society, but pseudonyms are used here.
The original statement made by the dreamer ran thus :
January 14, 1921.
On Saturday night, January 8, 1921, I slept at N Rectory,
Bedfordshire, and some time before 7.15 a.m. the time when
I was awakened on Sunday morning I had the following dream.
I saw a piece of water near a wood and standing near the
edge looking in was Miss [Colman] of Oxford. On one of the
fingers of her right hand was a signet ring engraved with her
monogram. She was holding this hand over the water when
I noticed a small white spider which bit it causing her so much
pain that she shook her hand violently, so that the ring dropped
off her finger into the water. Looking down into the water,
where the ring had disappeared, I noticed that it was so trans-
parent that I could see to the bottom. At the bottom were
several large square blocks of hewn stone and it looked as if the
ring were concealed under one of them. Miss [Colman] and
76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1021.
I seemed to be standing side by side looking down into the
water and talking with much energy when I awoke suddenly
with words still on my lips. I cannot remember what we were
talking about. The three things which the dream impressed
most vividly on my mind were (1) a spider of extreme whiteness,
(2) Miss [Colmanj's signet ring, (3) the great square blocks of
hewn stone at the bottom of the water. R. [DRAPER].
We have also received statements from Mr. Draper's mother
and from Miss Colman, thus :
1. Mrs. Draper's Statement.
January 14, 1921.
On January 12, 1921, I was lunching at my house [in] Oxford
with my son the Rev. R. [Draper] and Miss L. [Colman]. In
the course of conversation my son remarked that he had had
a curious dream on the previous Saturday night while sleeping
at - -
Rectory, Bedfordshire. I can remember the following
particulars which he gave of his dream. He saw Miss [Colman]
standing by side of a piece of water which he thought bore a
distant resemblance to an extremely pretty spot on the Aber-
gavenny Canal in Monmouthshire. He saw a white spider bite
her finger. She shook her hand in pain so that her ring dropped
into the water ; looking in he saw some square blocks of hewn
stone at the bottom of the stream. He could not see the ring
which had apparently disappeared under one of them.
Thereupon Miss [Colman] remarked that she had read something
like that in a paper at the reading-room on the previous Saturday
afternoon immediately after leaving my son, who was on his way
to the station. A. S. [DRAPER].
2. Miss Colman's Statement.
January 14, 1921.
On Saturday, January 8, [1921] I accompanied the Rev. R.
[Draper] as far as Carfax, where we parted at about 2.30 p.m.
He went on to the railway station en route for - -
Rectory,
Bedfordshire. I went at once to the city Reading-Room where
I read the Christmas number of the Illustrated London News.
It included an account of St. Bride which I read through, but
without remembering many details. At lunch the following
I
APRIL, 1921. Case : A Telepathic Dream. 77
Wednesday when I heard for the first time of Mr. [DraperJ's
dream, I did not remember the following particulars of the
account of St. Bride :
(1) As a child she used to play with blocks of wood and
stone as though they were living playmates.
(2) When she used to put her hands under the water the
fishes used to put their faces against her fingers.
(3) One day when she was by the water side a knight who
came to her asked her whether she had lost a ring
that she put her hand so much into the water.
The above particulars I noticed yesterday when as a consequence
of Mr. [DraperJ's dream I read through again the account of
St. Bride in the Christmas number of the Illustrated London News.
L. [COLMAN].
It will be observed that the points in Mr. Draper's dream
which appear to show a connexion with the story of St.
Bride, read by Miss Colman immediately after she parted
from him on the day before the dream are :
(1) the blocks
of stone, (2) the presence of a woman by a pool of water,
and (3) the idea of a ring being lost by falling into the water.
A point in Mr. Draper's dream for which telepathy from
Miss Colman does not appear to account is the white spider
which in his dream bit Miss Colman's hand, thus causing
her to lose the ring. The analogy with the story of the
fishes putting their faces against St. Bride's fingers is slight,
and the spider is left quite unaccounted for. We therefore
wrote to Mr. Draper to ask whether he could suggest anything
in his own experience which would throw light on this point.
We asked whether he had had any quite recent experience
which might have a bearing on the matter and whether
he was aware of having any particular feeling either of interest
in or dislike of spiders, especially white spiders, since the
colour of the spider appears to have been insisted on in his
dream.
He replied thus :
February 4, 1921.
I have been thinking very carefully about possible sources for
the appearance of the small white spider in my dream, but
have been utterly unable to find any clue. As far as I can
78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
gauge my disposition I am quite indifferent to spiders. When
I was a boy of ten or twelve years old at school I used to
read a little about spiders and take some slight interest in them.
But I cannot remember ever taking any interest in them since.
I very rarely, dream and cannot remember ever having dreamed
of a spider of any kind before.
I am sorry to be so slow in answering your letter. The delay
is due to the care I have taken in thinking of my past experiences
in the hope of finding some explanation of the white spider of
my dream.

L. 1230. A VERIDICAL APPARITION.
THE following report of a hallucination, which appears to
have been telepathically induced, has been sent to us by
Una, Lady Troubridge, the percipient, and Miss Radclyffe-Hall,
who was with Lady Troubridge at the time of the occurrence.
The name of the lady referred to here as Miss X. is known to
the Society.

STATEMENT BY LADY TROUBRIDGE.
PRINCES HOTEL, BRIGHTON,
August 23rd, 1920.
Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I left this hotel at 10.45 this morning,
having arranged yesterday to meet our friend Miss X. at a
neighbouring garage at 11 o clock with a view to availing ourselves
of her technical knowledge in the inspection of a car which Miss
Radclyffe-Hall desired to purchase. As we were walking up the
mews containing the garage, a long uphill road with garages all
the way up on both sides, and were within about thirty feet
approximately of our destination I could see two cars one a
black touring and one a dark red touring car standing outside
the garage to which we were bound, and between the red car
and the entrance of the garage I distinctly saw Miss X. standing
in profile facing towards the left. She was standing in an
attitude very familiar to me feet slightly apart, and the associa-
tion awoke in me that she was rocking slightly backwards and
forwards on her feet as she often does her head was thrust
rather forward and with a walking stick she was pointing and
LPRIL, 1921 Case : A Veridical Apparition. 79
gesticulating in front of her low down I took her to be indicating
the engines of some car standing out of my line of vision within
the garage. She was wearing a thin dark navy blue suit familiar
to me, and a black felt man's hat which I knew to be one I
had only seen her wear recently when staying at our house.
I said to Miss Radclyffe-Hall,
"
Oh, there is X., what a baby,
she is already there, she has got there before us to look at the
engine," thinking that the fascination of inspecting an engine
lad been too much for our friend, who had hurried to be previous
at the rendezvous. She seemed to be standing either against
the open glass door of the garage, or, it crossed my mind
without at the moment striking me as illogical, that I might-
be seeing her reflected in a glass, as her figure appeared as I
might say dark against a background of glass and yet as will
be seen by the sequel I not only saw her with normal distinct-
ness, but in a way too detailed in my opinion to be possible for
normal vision at some thirty feet away and I am very short
sighted and was only wearing a monocle, which assists my sight
less than the spectacles I sometimes wear, and although it did not
strike me at the time, when I described what I had seen to Miss
Radclyffe-Hall, prior to our joining Miss X., I realised that I had
noticed details in a manner which I thought, and still think, exceeded
my normal visual powers at that distance. I must have taken my
eyes off her as I spoke to Miss Radclyffe-Hall, because when the
latter in reply to my saying
"
There's X., etc." replied, ".Where
is she ?
"
I answered,
"
In the shop," the fact being that I no
longer saw her and assumed she had gone into the garage or
show-room. As we came up to it and entered the doors, I said
to the engineer who came forward,
"
Where is Miss X. ?
"
and
looked round surprised at not seeing her in fact I was walking
round a car that stood in the show-room expecting to find her,
when the man replied,
"
I haven't seen her this morning, she
hasn't arrived yet." In view of something which Miss X. had
told me not long ago regarding a supposed hallucination of her
seen by a friend, I then understood that something of this nature
had occurred and had the presence of mind not to exclaim aloud
that I had seen her but having walked all round the show-room
and ascertained that she was not there I remarked in an under-
tone in French to Miss Radclyffe-Hall,
"
All the same I saw her."
By this time I was awake to the possible importance of the
happening and also both Miss Radclyffe-Hall and I began to fear
80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
that the phenomenon might be associated with some mishap to
Miss X., so Miss Radclyffe-Hall told the engineer that we would
return later and we walked towards Miss X.'s house this was in
a neighbouring square some five minutes' walk from the garage.
As we went I described to Miss Radclyffe-Hall my vision, and I
said,
"
When we see her we must note how she is dressed and
we shall see whether she is wearing the suit I saw or another"
I told Miss Radclyffe-Hall that I felt sure I had seen her wrong
that what must have occurred was that Miss X. had sent out
a strong telepathic impression towards the place where we were to
meet and that I had caught it and externalised it, clothed
(simply because I personally liked and admired Miss X.) in
the hat and clothes which I thought most becoming to her. I
added and Miss Radclyffe-Hall agreed that it was very unlikely
she would be wearing the thin navy blue suit, as she had com-
plained to us that she felt cold in it had worn a thick tweed
on the previous day and would be sure to wear the same tweed
on this day, as it was a very cold morning and Miss Radclyffe-
Hall and I had put on thick tweeds and winter overcoats. When
we reached Miss X.'s house we enquired for her and were told
she had not yet gone out. We walked up and down and in a
few moments she came out of the house carrying a walking stick
and clad in the exact suit and hat that she had worn in my
vision. When I told her in Miss Radclyffe-Hall's presence how I
had seen her about ten minutes previously she replied that at
that time she was worried at the fear of being late for our
appointment, that the navy suit was lying, prepared for her to
put on, on her bed and that she had already decided to wear
the new black hat because she had since yesterday taken a violent
dislike to the other hat, a navy blue one she had been habitually
wearing but that she had never worn that black hat with that
navy suit before. UNA VINCENZO TROUBRIDGE. ^

ORIGINAL REPORT BY M. RADCLYFFE-HALL REGARDING LADY
TROUBRIDGE'S TELEPATHIC VISION OF Miss X.
PRINCES HOTEL, BRIGHTON,
August 23rd, 1920.
Una, Lady Troubridge and I were to meet Miss X. at a certain
motor garage this morning, the time fixed being 11 a.m. Miss
APRIL, 15>2
X. had
IL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 81
X. had promised to try a new car for me. Lady Troubridge
and I walked up the mews to the garage, it was about ten
minutes to eleven o'clock. As we neared the entrance Lady
Troubridge exclaimed,
"
Oh, there's X., what a baby ! She's
got here before us to look at the engine." I could not see our
friend; so enquired where she was. Lady Troubridge replied,
"
She's in the shop." (She meant in the show-room of the garage.)
We entered the garage together and looked about for Miss X.
and I noticed that Lady Troubridge seemed taken aback at not
seeing her at once. She spoke to a salesman saying,
"
Where is
Miss X. ?
"
he replied,
"
I haven't seen her this morning ;
Miss
X. has not arrived." Lady Troubridge seemed unconvinced and
looked behind a large car, she also glanced towards the back
garage as if expecting to see our friend, then she turned to me
and said in French,
"
All the same I saw her." We then left
the garage and I suggested going at once to our friend's house
to make enquiries. As we walked there Lady Troubridge told me
that
'
she thought she had experienced a telepathic hallucination
and wished to describe to me the clothes in which Miss X. had
appeared to her, before we knew what Miss X. would wear that
morning ;
this detail was important as Miss X. was not staying
at our hotel and could not have been seen by us prior to the
vision.
This is what Lady Troubridge described ;
she said that Miss
X. was wearing her dark blue suiting coat and skirt, carrying her
stick and wearing a particular new black felt hat that both
Lady Troubridge and I liked. Lady Troubridge said that it
would be interesting to see what clothes Miss X. was really
wearing, but for her part she felt certain that they would be
different, the reason she gave for this was that on the previous
day our friend had worn a thick pale blue tweed because it
was cold, and that as it was just as cold to-day, so cold that
we were wearing thick tweeds and heavy overcoats, it would
doubtless transpire that Miss X. would be wearing her heavy
suit and not the dark blue suiting, which she told us a few days
ago was too light in weight for such cold weather. Lady Trou-
bridge went on to speculate as to the causes which might have
contributed to her seeing our friend dressed in clothes other than
those which she felt sure she would find her actually wearing,
and we concluded that if this turned out to be the case it should
be attributed to mediumistic colouring on Lady Troubridge's part,.
82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
she having seen the vision clothed in the suit in which she liked
to see our friend. Nevertheless we attributed the origin of the
telepathic vision to Miss X. in the first instance.
Arrived at Miss X.'s house we asked whether she had already
left home and were informed that she had not done so ;
we said
that we would wait for her outside the house. In a few minutes
Miss X. joined us. She was wearing the very suit in which Lady
Troubridge had seen her and also the new black felt hat, she
was carrying her walking stick. We told her what had happened ;
.she expressed interest and seemed startled. We questioned her
.and she stated that she was thinking of us and of the garage at
about ten minutes to eleven, having realised as she dressed that
she would be late for the appointment, she had looked at her
watch and had felt fussed and worried. She stated that the suit
she was wearing was lying ready for her on the bed at that time
and that she had already decided to wear the black felt hat,
having taken a sudden dislike to the dark blue hat which she
always wore with this dark blue suit ;
she had taken a dislike
to the hat on the previous day. This dark blue hat was the one
which Miss X. had worn with the pale blue tweed suit yesterday,
and which we had hitherto seen her wear with the dark blue
suiting coat and skirt. We had never previously heard Miss
X. express a dislike for the dark blue hat. Miss X. volunteered
the information that she had never before this occasion worn
that particular black felt hat with the dark blue suit.
After describing to me Miss X.'s clothes on the way to her
house, Lady Troubridge described to me in the presence of Miss
X. the exact position by the entrance to the garage in which
she had seen the vision, also the characteristic pose in which
she had seen our friend, who, she said, appeared to be rocking
slightly backwards and forwards on her feet, her head thrust a
little forward while she gesticulated and pointed with her walking
stick ;
she said that she supposed her to be talking to a salesman
and pointing at some motor with her stick.
III.
M. KADCLYFFE-HALL'S AMPLIFICATION OF ORIGINAL STATEMENT.
September 20th, 1920.
Lady Troubridge and I were staying at Princes Hotel, Hove,
Brighton ;
we had gone there on August 20th, 1920, with a view
APRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 83
to being near Miss X., a friend of ours who was staying with
her mother at Hove. We have recently seen a great deal of
Miss X. in London, and she has stayed with us at Chip Chase,
Hadley Wood. With regard to the amount of rapport likely
to exist between Miss X. and ourselves, a rapport which it might
be thought would facilitate the occurrence which I am about to
relate, it may be as well to state that Miss X. and I have known
each other for many years but have only recently known each
other at all well, while on the other hand Lady Troubridge has
only known Miss X. during the past few months, during which
period, however, we three have become intimate friends.
We have discussed Psychical Kesearch with Miss X. on many
occasions, and on two or three occasions have been told by her
that, as she describes it, she has been said to appear to people
in her astral ;
she has assured us that these people have de-
scribed her appearance accurately afterwards, and that on one
occasion a friend of hers declared that she had spoken to the
vision and had been answered by it, and this in broad daylight
and in a most public place. Now with regard to the impression
that these statements made on us, I think I am safe in saying
that neither Lady Troubridge nor I myself took them very
seriously at the time ;
and Miss X. herself, having no knowledge
of her own exteriorizations, being conscious of no peculiar sensa-
tion and of no circumstances which would in her opinion have
been likely to cause such a thing, told us quite frankly that she
was relying entirely upon what her friends had told her. We
gathered that she neither believed nor disbelieved, that she
thought a certain amount of imagination might have played a
part in the statements made to her by her friends, but that,
nevertheless, the fact that this exteriorization had been reported
from several independent sources had, as was only natural, im-
pressed her. The exteriorization had been going on for years, the
first instance of it having occurred when Miss X. was at school.
I am quite certain, and so is Lady Troubridge, that when we
went to Hove we were not expecting to have this fact demon-
strated for ourselves, we were not thinking about Psychical
Research, from which we were purposely enjoying a complete
rest ;
had we been asked I think that we would have both said
that we wished to avoid the supernormal in all its aspects ;
we
were in a festive, holiday mood.
On August 23rd, 1920, that is to say on the third day after
84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
our arrival at Hove, Lady Troubridge and I had arranged to
meet Miss X. at a certain garage in Hove at 11 a.m. in order
that Miss X. might try a new motor for me. It happened
that Lady Troubridge and I were too early for the appointment
and that at ten minutes to eleven we were walking up the mews
in which the garage is situated. As we neared the entrance of
the garage, being approximately thirty feet away from the door,
Lady Troubridge exclaimed;
"
Oh! there's X., what a baby! She's
got here before us to look at the engines," or words to that
effect. I looked but could not see our friend, so enquired of
Lady Troubridge where she was, she replied
"
She's in the shop."
Now, as will be seen from Lady Troubridge's original report which
she made on the day of the occurrence, she told me that Miss
X. was in the shop ;
she explained to me afterwards that she
had not seen Miss X. walk into the shop, but had taken her
eyes off Miss X. in order to speak to me and not seeing her when
she again looked up, she naturally concluded that our friend had
gone into the show-room. We entered the garage together
expecting to see Miss X., and I noticed that Lady Troubridge
seemed taken aback to find that she was apparently not there ;
she spoke to a salesman who came forward, saying,
"
Where is
Miss X. ?
"
and he replied,
"
I haven't seen her this morning,
she has not arrived yet," or words to that effect. Lady Trou-
bridge did not seem convinced and I saw her glance around the
back of a large car, and look enquiringly towards an inner
garage as if expecting to see our friend. Apparently, however, she
saw nothing, because her astonishment appeared to me to grow
and she turned to me and said in a very emphatic undertone
in French,
"
All the same I saw her."
I was struck by the incident and naturally was reminded of
the stories Miss X. herself had told me regarding her curious
faculty for exteriorization. Lady Troubridge and I left the
garage, and as we felt a little uncomfortable, wondering if our
friend was well, I suggested going at once to her house to make
enquiries. This we did, the house being only a few minutes away
from the garage. As we walked away from the garage Lady
Troubridge told me that she thought she had experienced some
sort of telepathic hallucination, and that in view of its possible
importance she wished to describe to me the clothes in which
she had seen Miss X. before it w&s possible for us to know what
clothes our friend would be wearing that morning. I realised
APRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 85
the importance of this, the more so because, as I have already
stated, Miss X. was not staying in our hotel or anywhere within
sight of it or of the garage, so that we could not possibly have
seen her on the morning of the vision.
This is the description of Miss X.'s appearance as given to me
by Lady Troubridge on our way to Miss X.'s house. She said
that she had seen Miss X. dressed in a dark blue suiting coat and
skirt, carrying her usual walking stick and wearing a particular
new black felt hat which we especially liked. Lady Troubridge
said that it would be extremely interesting to see what clothes
Miss X. was really wearing, because for her part she felt quite
certain that they would be different to those seen in the vision.
Her reason for this supposition, she told me, was that on the
previous day our friend had worn a light coloured blue tweed
suit because it was cold, and that as it was just as cold on the
morning of the vision, so much so that we were dressed in heavy
tweeds and overcoats, it was ten to one that Miss X. would wear
her heavy tweed suit and not the dark blue suiting coat and
skirt, which she had told us a few days ago was too light in
weight for cold weather. And here, I would say in parenthesis,
that no two suits could be more dissimilar than Miss X.'s pale
blue tweed and her dark blue suiting coat and skirt ;
the former
is made of an Irish homespun in a very light nattier blue largely
used for ladies' and children's dresses; the jacket is short, roughly
tailored and has large leather buttons. The dark blue coating,
on the other hand, is of a navy that is almost black, with a
lounge coat very well fitted to the figure and giving an appearance
of extreme slimness and smartness which can certainly not be
said of the tweed. Lady Troubridge seemed convinced in her
own mind that she had clothed the vision to suit herself, and in
view of the biting wind I thought she was probably right. She
began to speculate as to the causes which might have contributed
to her seeing our friend in clothes quite other than those which
we both felt sure we would find her actually wearing, and we
concluded that if, as we thought, Miss X. should be found to be
wearing her warm coat and skirt, which was the only one that
seemed appropriate to the weather, we would be forced to con-
clude that Lady Troubridge had indulged in mediumistic colouring,
and had clothed the vision in the particular suit which in our
opinion was the most becoming to Miss X. I cannot say, how-
ever, that we hesitated to attribute the origin of the telepathic
56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
vision to Miss X. in the first place ;
I do not think that it ever
entered our minds to suppose that Lady Troubridge had imagined
what she saw, I know that I personally was absolutely convinced
that she had actually seen Miss X., or rather some part of Miss
X., or some vision of Miss X. as we approached that garage,
because the whole thing seemed so spontaneous and so natural
when Lady Troubridge first drew my attention to Miss X.'s pres-
ence, as did her astonishment and incredulity when she found
no Miss X. on entering the garage. It was not until a little
later that Lady Troubridge described to me in the presence of
Miss X. the exact spot just in front of the garage doorway,
where she had seen our friend standing pointing with her walking
stick at something, a gesture which was very characteristic of
Miss X. During the short walk from the garage to Miss X.'s
house Lady Troubridge had only time to describe the clothes in
detail and to speculate regarding their accuracy ;
this appeared to
her to be the only matter of importance, and I think she was right.
Arrived at Miss X.'s house we enquired whether she had already
left home that morning and the servant informed us that she had
not done so ;
we told him that we would wait for her outside
the house. In a few minutes Miss X. joined us on the pavement,
and to our great interest we found that she was dressed precisely
as she had been dressed in the telepathic vision. Miss X. was
wearing her dark blue suiting coat and skirt, in spite of the cold
she had not put on an overcoat or her heavier suit, and it must
be carefully remarked that she was wearing the particular new
black felt hat which Lady Troubridge had described to me. Miss
X. carried her walking stick, but this latter point is not im-
portant because we had never seen her without it at Hove.
We hastened to tell Miss X. what had happened and she seemed
interested and a little startled ;
we naturally questioned her
closely regarding her frame of mind at the time when Lady
Troubridge had seen the vision, wishing to know if she had been
thinking of us, etc., we learnt from her that she had been thinking
of us and of the motor garage at about ten minutes to eleven
o'clock, approximately the time when the vision was seen. She
told us that as she was dressing she realisejd that she would be
late for the appointment, that she looked at her watch, feeling
fussed and worried. We asked her at about what hour that
morning she had decided to wear her dark blue suiting coat and
skirt, and although she could not tell us the precise hour when
APRIL, 1921. Case : A Veridical Apparition. 87
this idea occurred to her, she was able to assure us that it must
have been prior to ten minutes to eleven since that particular
suit was lying ready for her on the bed before that hour. But
perhaps the most arresting feature in this case is the incident of
the new black felt hat. Miss X. told us that she had decided
that morning to wear this black felt hat because on the previous
day she had taken an unaccountable dislike to the navy blue
hat which it was her custom to wear with that suit, and which
incidentally we had always seen her wear with it. Miss X. went
on to say that she had never before this occasion worn that
particular black felt hat with the dark blue suit, she was perfectly
clear and emphatic on this point.
One may ask why, at the time of the vision, Lady Troubridge
was not very much struck by the fact that our friend was wearing
an unusual hat with that suit. Lady Troubridge says that she
was not struck by this fact, she states that she was pleased our
friend was wearing this new black felt hat, as although not very
dissimilar from other country hats worn by Miss X., it was
newer, a smarter shape and more becoming. It is difficult, except
upon the hypothesis of the experience having been that of a
genuine telepathic vision, to know why the black hat should
have been present ; we had neither of us heard Miss X. express
the least dislike of the dark blue hat, which hat, as it happens,
she had been wearing on the previous day with her pale blue
tweed suit ;
in fact ever since we had arrived at Hove Miss X.
had worn either a Panama, a light grey hat, or the dark blue
felt hat which she should have been wearing on the morning of
the vision ;
we had seen the new black hat in the hall of her
house, I think, in any case we knew the hat because she had worn
it when staying with us at Chip Chase, but, as I have stated,
we had not seen her wear it at Hove, which appears to add to
the interest of this case.
In conclusion I would point out those facts which appear to
me to render it well-nigh impossible that Lady Troubridge could
have imagined the vision, or for perhaps impossible is too strong
a word at least improbable. She had never seen the black
hat worn at Hove and Miss X. had never before worn it with
that particular suit, therefore Lady Troubridge can never have
seen Miss X. dressed in precisely that manner prior to the vision ;
again, Lady Troubridge associated quite a different suit with
cold weather, not only because she had seen Miss X. wearing a
88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1921.
heavy tweed suit when it was cold, but because Miss X. had
complained a few days previously of the fact that her suiting
coat and skirt were too thin to wear in cold weather ; and,
yet again, on the previous day Lady Troubridge had seen our
friend dressed in a totally different suit because it was cold,
and wearing, not the black felt hat of the vision, but the dark
blue felt hat which Miss X. had told us was the only one that
kept on when it was windy. If an association of ideas had
played any part in the vision seen by Lady Troubridge, then
surely she should have seen Miss X. dressed in the pale blue
tweed suit and wearing the dark blue felt hat ;
or if she saw her
in the suiting coat and skirt, then she should also have seen her
wearing the dark blue felt hat which was the hat associated in
her mind with that suit.
It may be of interest to close with a word or two regarding
Miss X. and ourselves. Miss X. is about forty-five years old,
she is a great athlete, and enjoys exceptionally good health.
She is interested in Psychical Research, in Theosophy and kindred
subjects, has read a great deal, but is not in the habit of fre-
quenting mediums or taking an active part in such matters.
Beyond the fact that she undoubtedly felt flurried and annoyed
at the idea of being late for her appointment with us on that
morning, and that at about the time of the vision she was
thinking of us and of the garage, we have not been able to trace
any predisposing factors, such for instance as illness, sleep, or a
state of acute agitation. As for ourselves, Lady Troubridge
and I were feeling unusually well, and beyond the fact that,
having come to Hove in order to be with Miss X., she was
naturally much in our minds, not only as we approached the
garage to keep the appointment but more or less all the time,
we have been unable to discover any predisposing factors in our
own conditions.

Miss X.'s STATEMENT.
Regarding the telepathic vision, astral vision, or whatever it
may have been, that Lady Troubridge saw of me standing just
outside the garage at Hove on August 23rd, 1920 : I have read
the reports of the occurrence drawn up by Lady Troubridge
and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, and I certify that these reports of
theirs are quite correct regarding all those details that came
within my personal knowledge. (Signed) X.

NEWSPAPER TESTS.
BY THE REV. C. DRAYTON THOMAS.
MY chief communicator in sittings with Mrs. Osborne Leonard
claims to be my father. That name is used in alluding to
him in this paper. The tiresome repetition of qualifying
phrases is thus avoided and I have the advantage of using
a term which is in harmony with my conviction. This will,
I trust, be no hindrance to readers who may not be disposed
to concede the question of identity.
In the autumn of 1919 my father commenced to give
references to items which could be verified from the next
day's Press. They may therefore be termed Newspaper Tests,
although they have also been selected from Magazines before
publication. The majority have referred to The Times, but
The Morning Post and The Daily Telegraph are sometimes
used. Names in these papers referring to strangers are linked
by him for test purposes with persons of like name known to
me and in a manner which will be easily understood from the
following examples.

"

way down or nearly so, will be your name and your father's,
your own coming first."

ment containing the name Charles John Workman. My name
is Charles, my father's is John. Inspection of these columns

for several previous days shows no other such conjunction of
these names.
"In the first column and much in line with the above there
is an address mentioned which he knows well, he knows the
locality and town."
Exactly parallel with our names there appeared in column
one,
"
Ventnor, I.W" It was the only address meeting the
description and it answered the test to perfection. My father
had worked in the island, and frequently visited Ventnor on
professional duty.
He now said he would make "
an attempt at clairvoyance
on the physical plane," and proceeded to state that, close
to our names and the address, there was a word looking like
"
Loos." Thinking this too vague I asked if the verb
"
to
lose
"
or the adjective
"
loose
"
was meant ? The control
replied that it was more the name of a town, or possibly a
person. I mentally concluded that if this word were there it
would prove to be the French Loos, of which one not in-
frequently heard during the war. To my considerable surprise
I found, in a
"

"
notice immediately following
our names, that a bridegroom living at Loose Court had been
married at the Church of All Saints, Loose. This was my
first acquaintance with the fact that a Kentish village bears
this name. One can scarcely suppose that the appearance
of such a name in an exact position described on the previous
day can be attributed to chance.

.name." I asked if his three names were there and was told
to look for two of them.
Three inches from the top of this column was Alfred and
immediately beneath it William. Although I knew that
Alfred's second name commenced with
"
W "
I do not think
I ever knew what it stood for, and had to refer to family
records before discovering that his full name was Alfred
William Thomas. It became evident that my communicator
knew more about Alfred than I did, as well as having superior
MAY, 1921. Newspaper Tcul*. 91
knowledge of what the next morning's paper would contain.
He told me that he had just come from the newspaper office
where he had been selecting tests as best he could from
incomplete preparations for the paper. This is his explanation
of knowledge in the one direction ;
that he is Alfred's brother
should sufficiently explain his knowledge in the other.
Second statement. I was to look close to Alfred's name for
that of a family with which we are connected by marriage.
At first sight this seemed to offer a somewhat wide range of
choice, but search down the column revealed only one name
meeting the case, and this was but two inches from Alfred.
In none of the columns could another be found ;
there was
but one and that one close to Alfred, the name of a family
with which we are connected through Alfred's wife.
Third statement. Not far from Alfred's name he noticed
one announcement which was three or more times longer than
the others. Now, the average length was four or five lines,
but within four inches of Alfred was the longest of all no
less than fifteen lines. The above three tests lay close together
as though a small portion of the paper had been taken and
search made for suitable tests within its narrow limits. Some-
times the tests are scattered but usually there is a clump
in one spot. A glance at The Times for the previous day
shows that not a single reference would have been correct
then ; they were only right for the day stated.
I had taken the precaution of calling upon a sceptical friend
and giving him a copy of the tests on my way home from the
sittings, thus securing evidence in case my accuracy as to
dates and hours were challenged. Realising by this time that
these tests were likely to be continued I commenced to make
duplicate copies, sending the second by post the same evening
to the secretary of the Society for Psychical Research. Thus
two persons have copies of these tests before the next morning's
papers are issued, and this protects me against slips of memory
or charges of inaccuracy.
November 7th, 1919, at 3 p.m.
"
In The Times for to-morrow, about one-third down the second
column of the first page, is the name of your wife's mother, and
A2
92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1021.
also within half an inch, or say five-eighths of an inch to be safe,
is that of another of her near relations."
Slightly less than a third down this column names ap-
peared as stated. They are Mary and Alice (my wife's
mother and sister).
"
About two inches lower is the name of someone belonging to
your wife's mother in South Africa."
Three and a half inches below appears the name Norman,
a grandson then residing in Durban, Natal.
"
There is also a word or name which suggests an animal to
him. This and the first two names are all within the space of
five-eighths of an inch."
The first three letters of Sowerby in the next notice bring
to mind a familiar quadruped, and this .name and the previous
two are even closer together than stated ;
for a square half inch
of the paper contains all three.
November 21st, 1919, at 3 p.m.
After allusion to something one-third down the second
column the test continued,
"
Also in the near vicinity is the
name of a place in which Mr. Hine resided." We had been
conversing at a previous sitting about this gentleman who,
forty years ago, was the personal friend of my father and a
prominent official in his church at Baldock in Hertfordshire.
As he had long ago removed to London I was uncertain
what place might be intended and was interested next morning
to find at the top of the second column the old and familiar
address, Baldock, Herts.
"
To strengthen the test he tells
you that something in conjunction with the above made him
think of a person's name. It will strike you."
*
It did.
The next words following Baldock, Herts were Funeral at
Golder's Green. Here Green is a place-name, but it at once
brought to mind the way in which, as a personal name, it
had been used from time to -
time during my long series of
sittings. It was the name of a gentleman well known to us
1
This sentence was inadvertently omitted in the copy of my notes sent to
the S.P.B.
MAT, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 93
both. Baldock and Green absolutely met the requirements of
the reference.
After describing where, in column three, my mother's name
would be found he continued :
"
Very close to it your uncle Alfred is named, also there is
the name of one in whom he is very interested."
On a parallel line were the names Thomas William, being
two out of the three of my uncle Alfred William Thomas.
This is a little way down the first column, while two inches
distant in column two is the name of Alfred's eldest daughter
Florence. None of these would have been right for the
paper of the previous day.
December th, 1919, at 12 noon.
This sitting was earlier than usual and one of the first
remarks made respecting the tests was that they had been
selected when preparations for the next day's issue had not
progressed so far as usual. Recollecting this the change in
position of the following test-name is specially interesting.
"
On page one and column one, about two inches from the
bottom, he thought he saw clairvoyantly the name Hutchinson."
At first I had written this as Hutchison, but on spelling it
aloud was told to insert an
"
n
"
after
"
i
"
making it Hutchin-
son. Searching next morning in the spot named I failed to
find it, but turning from the bottom of the first to the top
of the second column discovered it there in the corrected
form, Hutchinson. A moment's consideration will show how
easily this notice may have been transferred from the one
place to the other after the hour of noon on the day previous
to publication ; for, as I am informed, alterations may be
le up to within a short time of printing at 11 p.m., and
the insertion of a few more birth and marriage announcements
would have been sufficient to account for the changed position
)f this notice. It is in the third notice from the top.
In column two, about two-thirds down the page, he saw the
le Louisa connected or linked with the name of another
member of our family ; he means in the same advertisement."
94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1021.
Note here the evident knowledge that Louisa is a member
of
"
our family
"
;
there had been no previous mention of
this name in any of my sittings. She is a niece of the
communicator, being another of Alfred's daughters. Slightly
more than two-thirds down the first column (not the second
as stated ;
there is again some inaccuracy as to position),
the name Louise is found (my cousin's name is spelled Louisa).
And in the same notice appears my father's name, John.
Thus names of niece and uncle are together.
After speaking of something higher up the first column he
proceeded :
..." Close to it is a direct reference to your mother ;
her
name is given ;
but there is also a further reference to her. It is
difficult to express it, say a name linked with her in another
way."
The first assertion is especially interesting because the name
Jane is there, a name which my mother only uses in her
legal signature, one which only the inner circle would recognise
as belonging to her. The second part of the test is met by
the appearance of the name Mrs. Thomas less than an inch
below, while in the same notice with Jane is John, my father's
name.
February 27th, 1920, at 3.30 p.m.
"
About the middle of column one there is named a place of
which your mother was very fond in her girlhood. She spent
very happy times there."
At the spot named occurs
"
/. of W." The Isle of Wight
was my mother's native place.
"
Quite close is a name suggesting music to him."
Two inches below is the name Harper.
"
Near this is his own name and very close indeed, probably
in the same advertisement, is the name of a near relative of
your wife's, one who has passed over."
In the advertisement above Harper is Thomas, and also
Frances. My wife had an aunt Frances now passed over.
"
Fold the page across so as to divide it into equal halves
right and left, and in the first complete column beyond the crease,

to the right, and less than a quarter down, is a message from
him to mother." (I asked,
"
How shall I be sure which it is ? ")
"
Close to it is a name or initials which would fit very well."
Exactly where stated is an advertisement in which occur
the words,
"
Portland . . . Anxious to get in touch," and in
the adjoining parallel advertisement is the following line twice
repeated, "/.TF. and D. and I.W.T." All this fits peculiarly
well. One of my father's early circuits was Portland ;
we
always think of it in connection with things he told us about
his residence there, and we have no associations with it apart
from him. That he is anxious to get in touch with mother
is clear from his frequent allusions and messages to her in
these sittings. The initials are applicable. His name was
Drayton and when living in the Isle of Wight he married,
and my mother's maiden name was Dore. Thus the initial
reference may be interpreted either as
"
Isle of Wight and
Drayton, and Isle of Wight and Thomas "
or, indicating
my mother's change of name there,
"
Isle of Wight and Dore,
and Isle of Wight and Thomas."
March Uth, 1920, at 2.48 p.m.
At this sitting I was accompanied by a Clergyman who
was unknown to Mrs. Leonard and whose name was
not mentioned. He came with me because a few weeks
earlier I had received messages of a fragmentary character
purporting to come from his wife, and it seemed possible that
in his presence something more might be forthcoming. The
following tests were for him and were said to be given by
his wife.
"
Near the top of column two, first page of to-morrow's Times,
the Christian name of the lady who comes with this gentleman."
Four inches from the top of the column was the name Anne
(aria. My friend told me during our return journey while
were discussing these tests that his wife's name was Annie
, Mrs. Leonard's Control had more than once remarked
the difficulty she experiences in distinguishing between
m, Anne and Annie, as they sound or seem to her so much
alike. I have noticed this difficulty with other mediums also.
96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921
"
Close to it is this gentleman's Christian name. These are
close together, possibly within half an inch." Here I asked my
father,
"
How do you know these names ? I do not know them
myself !
"
The Control replied,
"
He did not know them, but
this lady went with him to look them out. If correct she will
go again and look out others. It makes a still better test when
you do not know the names."
Immediately following the above two names came The Rev.
Frederick. My friend's name is Frederic (without the
"
k ").
These names appeared upon adjoining lines within half an inch
as stated.
"
About one-third down column two is the name of a place
at which this lady lived and which she liked."
Wishing to be in a position to examine these tests next
day I asked during our return journey what towns would
fulfil this assertion. The Rev. Frederic named two which
would meet the test. One was the home of her childhood and
the other Cambridge. He included the latter because, although
his wife had not actually resided there, she had frequently
stayed on long visits to her uncle, a University Professor,
and was greatly attached to the place. One-quarter down
this column appears Cambridge.
These three tests so confirmed were accepted by my friend
as indications that his wife was in touch with us. She had
given her name and his in an unmistakable way, and named
the place which he knew to be associated in her mind with
most pleasant recollections. Many other evidences of her
identity were given, both then and at a subsequent interview
with Mrs. Leonard, but the above may suffice for our immediate
purpose. They are certainly difficult to explain on any
supposition other than that of communication from the spirit
side of life. None of the facts could have been known to
Mrs. Leonard, who saw my friend for the first time and did
not know his name.
I now proceed to an incident which still further rules out
any hypothesis of telepathy from minds on earth. When
commencing a conversation on March 26th, 1920, I explained
to my father that owing to absence from home it would be
MAY, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 97
impossible to keep my appointment for that day fortnight and
that I would send a friend. I gave not the slightest clue
as to who it would be, but had arranged to let a medical
man have the interview, hoping that he might get into com-
munication with his brother. I was not a little surprised
therefore when my father replied that he would be present
and bring my friend's friend with whom he had already
attended one sitting. I understood the reference ;
fifteen
months previously I had accompanied this doctor to a clair-
voyante, and although nothing of interest transpired there
my father had alluded to the occasion when next I spoke to
him at Mrs. Leonard's, saying that he had been present and
noticed my friend's friend trying unsuccessfully to impress
the clairvoyante with his thoughts. It would therefore seem
that my purpose to send this Doctor was already known to
my father. By no normal means could Mrs. Leonard have
been aware of it, and the telepathy theory can scarcely be
invoked to explain what follows.
April 23rd, 1920, at 3 p.m.
The first set of tests given me on this date proved to be
for my medical friend from his brother, who had successfully
communicated with him through Mrs. Leonard since my
previous visit.
"
The first set of tests are for your friend from his spirit
communicator whose name is about half-way down the first
column of the first page of The Times for to-morrow."
Exactly half-way down that column appears the name
Dyson, which is correct.
"
Very close to it is your friend's name or one almost similar."
Two and a half inches below Dyson is the name St. Andrew's.
Until receiving his comments upon these tests I had been
unaware that his second name was Andrews.
"
Almost
similar," the apostrophe makes the difference.
"
A little below, say three-quarters down, is the name of a
place which they have visited together and much enjoyed."
98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.
Dr. Dyson on inspecting the paper found at this spot a men-
tion of Filey, a place where he and his brother had frequently
spent holidays together.
"
A little above is the name of a mutual friend of theirs."
He writes that almost immediately above the previous names
appear Jones and Davies, and that either of these might be
the mutual friend.
"
Near the top of column one is the name of a great friend
who has passed on and is with the spirit young man "
(i.e.
with the Doctor's brother).
His letter continues :
"
The first notice at the top of
column one contains the name Jack. This must be Jack
Nancarrow, he is absolutely the only great friend now passed
over that I have. Moreover in all the first half of column
one there is no other name or surname whatever of any
friend of mine."
Of all the above information I knew nothing save the
friendship with Nancarrow and the name Dyson. Clearly
therefore there had been no reading of my mind. Nor is it
easy to see how, even had these facts been known to me,
mind-reading could account for such piecing together and
accurate selection from The Times as forms the peculiar feature
of these tests. The information given for my two friends,
the Clergyman and the Doctor, was as surprising to them as
it was unexpected by me.
The foregoing have been selected from among earlier tests.
The following are from more recent examples.
December 10th, 1920, at 5.57 p.m.
"
In The Times for to-morrow, column two of front page and
close to the top, he thinks within an inch, is the name of a friend,
a man, whom you were helping lately."
There exactly was Leslie. I had recently been discussing
books and other matters with Mr. Leslie Curnow, and only a
week before had spent an evening at his rooms in order to
MAY, 1921.
Newspaper Tests.
study some psychic problems about which he was good enough
to desire my opinion.
"
Very close, almost in conjunction with it, is another name
which will be an additional clue to him."
Perpendicularly above the name Leslie, and separated only
by a single line, was Queen-square. As Mr. Curnow is on the
staff of Light, the offices of which are at 6 Queen-square,
this is conclusive ; especially as I have rarely met him any-
where else than at this address. But since both the above
names were embodied in the section headed
"
In Memoriam,"
it seemed necessary to discover whether they had appeared
there on the same date in the previous year. I found that
while Leslie had been there twelve months before, Queen-square
had not. Neither had they been inserted on the day when
the test was given.
"
About three-quarters down column one are the names of two
relations of your wife whom he often sees on the other side."
Just above three-quarters down this column appear together
the names Emilie Mary. My wife's sister was named Emily,
and her mother Mary. Both have frequently sent messages
to her at these sittings.
January 7th, 1921, at 6.50 p.m.
"
In The Times for to-morrow, page one and a little above half-
way down column one, is the name Edward, also very close
he thought there was an address of a rectory, or parsonage,
or place connected with a church."
This was exact. Less than three inches above the half of
the first column appears Edward and in the same advertise-
ment on the next line but one is Scrivelsby Rectory.
After a reference to something in the upper part of column
two he added :
"
Quite close is my name and that of another on my side
the family."
One inch above a quarter down this column, and in the same
notice, appear the names John, and Mary (his sister).
100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1021.
January 20th, 1921, at 3.45 p.m.
After an allusion to something four inches down the third
column of the usual front page of The Times he proceeded :
"
A little above is a name which was well known in the family
in former days, and just about the same place is a name given
in abbreviated form, one well known in the family too."
This is perfectly met by the name Benjamin which appears
one inch from the top, and by the letter
"
C "
in the top
line. It is a capital
"
C "
standing by itself and evidently
intended by the inserter to represent a person's name. We
have long used it thus in our family.
'
In the upper part of column two is named a place in which
you lived when you were connected with conditions in which
Margaret would be specially interested."
Two inches from the top is "7. of TF." When living there
I was engaged in the same kind of business as that pursued
by Margaret's father in his earlier life. There is clear hint
of identity here, for it was only by referring to family letters
that I discovered this fact about my aunt Margaret's father,
whereas it would have been well known to my father.
"
Very close is named a second place which you knew well
when living at the first place ; you would go to it, hear of it,
and think of it."
The next word was Ventnor and the reference is correct.
"
A little lower something made him think of golf ;
he did
not look for it, but suddenly found himself so thinking, the
words made him do so."
Four inches lower in the parallel column is the phrase,
"
Out of bounds !
"
Although my father did not play golf
he may have heard the expression from me ;
I not infrequently
have need to make this observation when golfing !
February tth, 1921, at 6.20 p.m.
In The Times for to-morrow, column two, page one and one
quarter down, there is a saint's name which belongs to a member

of my family, not John. Its owner is with me and I often see
him."
One quarter down is James, the name of father's uncle, who
died in 1879.
"
Very close are two names strongly suggesting Roman Cath-
olicism."
Less than two inches above James appear the names, Costa
Ricci and immediately over the Ricci are the letters R.I.P.
The name Ricci is closely connected with the Jesuits, Lorenzo
Ricci having been General of the Society in 1759 and promin-
ent in activities which culminated in its expulsion from France.
Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) was a prominent Jesuit missionary
to China, and there were others. Costa was the celebrated
Italian painter whose picture of
"
The Madonna and Child
Enthroned
"
is in the National Gallery. The letters R.I.P.
next these two names complete the suggestiveness ; probably
no one conversant with the history of the Roman Church
would fail to be reminded of it by such a conjunction. My
father had made a careful study of the history of the Jesuits,
"
At the bottom of column one is Uncle Alfred's name, and
close by are certain words which would refer to his niece
'
E ',
not a name but words."
Four and a half inches from the bottom of this column
appear the names William Thomas. One inch below is notice
of a death
"
of heart failure," which connects with the recent
death of his niece
"
E "
by heart failure after an operation.
It will be noticed that while some of the above tests are
mere statements of what will be in the morrow's Press, others
go beyond this, revealing intimate acquaintance with family
connections. Telepathy from the living is a theory which
seems to break down in face of these experiments. Could
such an hypothesis explain the method by which knowledge
of our family became interwoven with forecasts from the next
day's newspaper ? It is certain that many of these forecasts
have been correct, and whether they were obtained by normal
or supernormal means is not the chief question ;
for a further
line of information is apparent, information upon family
matters which even unimpeded access to the editorial office
102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.
of The Times could not give, and which the medium can
scarcely be supposed to possess. The problem is this : How
do these two streams of knowledge become merged ? I have
no doubt but that the spirit who speaks through Mrs. Leonard
succeeds in obtaining items from the preparations for the
next day's paper, and, already possessing full knowledge of
our family circle, composes an amalgam of the two for the
very definite purpose of these experiments.
It may be said of these newspaper tests, as of the book tests
which preceded them, that they were introduced by intelligence
other than our own and neither asked for nor anticipated by
us. They reveal that complete remembrance of family and
other names which we should expect our friends to retain,
but which the limitations of ordinary trance mediumship
afford them but small opportunity of demonstrating. They
seem to overthrow the suggestion sometimes put forward of
telepathy from the sitter's mind. Stretch that hypothesis as
we may it can hardly account for the selection and bringing
together of old memories and the morrow's Press ;
nor does
it explain the precise locating of names, and the assertion of
connections between these and facts unknown to the sitter.
Queries as to fraud or collusion would seem to be out of
place here. In view of the hour at which the tests were
given, and the kind of knowledge many of them display, we
are safe in assuming the inadequacy of this supposition.
It is otherwise with the question of coincidence. Can
chance explain ? I will indicate reasons for concluding that
it does not.
Many of the family names alluded to in this series of tests
are sufficiently common to be assured of a place in every
issue of The Times. Unless their position were somewhat
definitely stated there would be ample room for coincidence.
It will have been noticed that the position is usually given
within, at least, the margin of one quarter of a column.
But even so, with certain common names and even for the
conjunction of two such, there might easily be chance cor-
respondence. Possibly because of this the communicator usually
associates such names with other items. When three or more
statements are linked together a coincidence, although still
possible, is unlikely ;
and if, over a long series of such linked
MAY, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 103
tests, verification continues to be steadily maintained, we
gradually perceive that the happenings are not by chance.
This perception is hastened by the evidence that a considerable
range of familiarity with family relationships and events of
long ago is at the disposal of the communicator.
It is an easy matter to take a number of such tests seriatim
and discover how far they will apply to issues of The Times
for other dates than those for which originally given. The
carrying out of such a comparison will do more than argument
to show how small a part is played by chance in producing
the results.
I have done this with the above fifty-three tests, looking
for each one in six issues of The Times selected at random.
In examining the result given below it will be noticed that,
although considerable latitude as regards position was allowed,
in no instance did this six-fold chance yield as many successes
from one paper as did the original verification. The greater
part of the coincidences related to common names, especially
in such tests as could be met by the presence of any one
out of some half dozen names ;
as when searching for,
"
A
relative of your wife
"
or
"
One in whom Alfred is interested."
Since two of the fifty-three tests described in this paper
were misplaced we get a total of fifty-one successes. Ex-
amining The Times of other dates for correspondences which
would result from chance only twenty-seven are found; and
this notwithstanding the fact that no less than six papers
were searched for each item. If the total for the six papers
be divided by six the result shows a fraction under thirteen
as the average secured by chance, against the fifty-one obtained
by my communicator. It is therefore clear that coincidence
does not explain the facts.
It should be further noted that these chance correspondences
are frequently less apt than the original verifications. And
out of the chance successes about half relate to one or other
of the common names, Mary, Emily, John, William, Thomas.
It seems fairly evident that had such tests been selected as
excluded all reference to common names, and had these tests
alone been used for the comparison, the result would have
been a reduction of the chance successes to near vanishing
point.

sometimes the name required was
too far from the spot indicated, at other times a test would
be expressed in too vague a way to ensure conviction that

EDITORIAL NOTE.
READERS of Mr. Drayton Thomas's paper may ask what pro-
cedure is followed in regard to setting up in type such advertise-
ments in the Times as are referred to in the
"
tests." Sir
William Barrett, F.R.S., has kindly forwarded to us two letters
he received from the manager of the Times which throw light
upon this question. The first letter is as follows :
PRINTING HOUSE SQUARE, E.G. 4,
October IQth, 1920.
The small advertisements in the Times (which include Births, Deaths
and Marriages) arrive at all hours of the day, and we commence setting
them at 5 p.m. I should think that often quite half of them are
set before 8 p.m., and sometimes even a larger proportion than this.
Beyond this, you may notice that many announcements are ordered
to appear for two or three insertions. Consequently, some of them
are in type for two days.
If you care to give me any particular instances, I will gladly make
an enquiry.
In reply to the invitation contained in the last sentence of
the above letter. Sir William Barrett wrote asking for particulars
concerning the particular notice referred to above on p. 95, and
given at a sitting when Mr. Drayton Thomas was accompanied
by a friend the Rev. Frederic .
The reply from the manager of the Times ran thus :
October 25th, 1920.
In reply to your letter of even date, I had the original copy of
the announcement referred to by the Rev. F. brought up to
MAT, 1921. Newspaper Tests. 107
me, and find that this was in the office by 9.27 a.m. of the morning
of the 16th March, and was inserted the following day. By the time
referred to 4 or 5 o'clock of the 16th March, the copy had been
set up for some considerable time, and of course had been seen by
several members of our staff.
Mr. Drayton Thomas's sittings were held at various times
between about 11.45 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. So that it would appear
from the statement made in the first letter from the manager
of the Times that at the time of the sitting the particular notices
referred to in the tests might in some cases be already set up
in type ;
in other cases they were probably not yet set up ;
in any case their ultimate position' on the page could not be
normally known until late in the afternoon. We may therefore
conclude that, quite apart from other evidence we have of Mrs.
Leonard's honesty, the possibility of collusion or fraud may
be dismissed as inadequate to explain the facts. As to what
methods Mr. Drayton Thomas's
"
communicators
"
may have
adopted to acquire the knowledge necessary for their purpose,
we are unfortunately quite in the dark. These newspaper tests
differ from book tests in this respect, that for some days at
least before a book test was given the books were all standing
ready in their shelves and, assuming clairvoyance, might at
.any moment be clairvoyantly perceived.
EEVIEW.
The Earthen Vessel. By PAMELA GLENCONNER. With a Preface
by SIR OLIVER LODGE. (John Lane, 7s. 6d.)
We have in this book, which gives an account of eighteen
book-tests obtained by Lady Glenconner and nine by the Revd.
Charles Drayton Thomas, at sittings with Mrs. Leonard, a
valuable contribution to the literature of psychical research. The
ostensible communicator of the tests is Edward Wyndham Tennant,
a son of Lord and Lady Glenconner. Nearly all of the items are
good, and some of a remarkably convincing character, as for
instance the following :
Feda. " Bim now wants to send a message to his Father. This book is
particularly for his Father ; underline that, he says. It is the ninth book
. . . take the title, and look at p. 37."
We found the ninth book on the shelf indicated was Trees, by J. Harvey
Kelman. And on p. 36, quite at the bottom and leading on to p. 37, we
read: " Sometimes you will see curious marks in the wood; these are caused
by a tunnelling beetle, very injurious to the trees. ..."
108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1921.
The point is that in pre-war days forestry was Lord Glenconner's
chief interest, and it would have been a surprise to his family,
when taking a walk with him, if he did not call attention to the
ravages made by this particular insect. For aptness and precision
the example would be hard to beat.
The precautions taken in identification of the books and passages
are not set out with the particularity with which they are given
in the Society's publications, but it was hardly necessary, and
there is no reason to doubt that all care was taken about this
important detail of the experiments. The book is of great
interest, and there can be little doubt that it will do much to
awaken extended interest in the inquiry ;
for the significance of
these tests is much more easily grasped by the general public
than is the case with cross-correspondences, the records of which,.
it must be admitted, are sometimes very hard reading.
It seems at first blush as though the book-tests, of which we
have now a considerable number, made the evidence for survival
much more convincing than it was before. Yet on the other
hand it may be argued that the extraordinary clairvoyant power
shown might possibly belong to the medium no less than to a
discarnate spirit. It would be out of place to discuss this
question here, but I will venture to remark that, while the
possession of the power by a spirit after death is hardly less
wonderful than its possession by one still in the flesh, the
evidence at present seems to point to the
"
communicators
"
as authors of the tests far more strongly than to the medium.
Some further light on the point might be obtained, if experiments
were made to see whether a medium can produce similar successful
book-tests without any suggestion from the sitter of a desire to
communicate with a spirit, and without any claim by the medium
to assistance from the spirit world. At the same time, it is
notoriously difficult to keep out spirits who want to come in,
and it might be difficult to prove in the case of a successful
experiment of this kind that some spirit had not had a hand in
the business after all. In past times Hotspur and others have
been sceptical to the point of rudeness about the possibility of
raising spirits ;
it may prove that the difficulty is rather in
"
laying
"
them, and the Percies may yet have to vail to the
Glendowers. M. A. BAYFIELD.

THE GENESIS OF APPARITIONS.
BY SIR W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S.
IN the February number of the Journal of the American
Society for Psychical Research, appears an article by the late
Dr. Hyslop, entitled
"
Question begging Explanations," in
which he criticizes a suggested explanation of certain veridical
phantasms which I have given in my book On the Threshold
of the Unseen. The explanation I gave is not new and is
contained in the following words which Dr. Hyslop quotes
from my book :
"
If we regard apparitions of the dying and
dead as phantasms projected from the mind of the percipient,
the difficulties of clothes and the ghosts of animal pets, which
sometimes are seen, disappear." I go on to explain that there
is nothing improbable in this, as the appearances of the things
we see around us are in like manner phantasms projected by
our mind into the external world. In the latter case the
inverted retinal image of the object seen is not viewed by us
as a photographer looks at the image on his ground glass
screen, but is transmitted to the brain, impresses certain
cells and
"
then we mentally project outside ourselves a large
erect phantasm of the retinal image . . . This phantasm is
no more a real thing than is the visual image of ourselves
we see in a looking-glass." In like manner we -may conceive
that a telepathic impression made on the same brain cells
may cause a visual reaction and an image of the telepathic
impression
"
would be projected by our mind into external
space." In all cases it is not the eye which sees but the
mind.
Dr. Hyslop remarks that he himself has often described
apparitions as telepathic phantasms produced by the influence
of an outside mind, but he objects to my use of the word
"
projected
"
because a
"
projected phantasm could not be
distinguished from the external reality, perhaps, unless we
meant to invoke internal causes for its nature instead of
reality outside the subject." For a phantasm, he adds,
"
is a
purely subjective and not an objective phenomenon."
Now an apparition of a distant person appears just as real
as any external object, so far as the visual sense is concerned ;
JNE, 1921. The Genesis of Apparitions. 113
le difference being not only its
"
internal cause," but its
ranescent character and that its objectivity is
usually not con-
ied by our other senses. It is very difficult to grasp what Dr.
[yslop is driving at in his very long and involved criticism
my statement. Apparently it comes to this, that to speak
the projection outside ourselves either of the retinal image
lade by an external object, or a telepathic impact on the
>rain,
"
is a misleading description of the process." "It is far
itter," Dr. Hyslop says,
"
to use the term reference. We
fer the cause of the phantasms to a point outside ourselves."
have not the least objection to this. Dr. Hyslop, however,
tbours under an amusing and obvious misapprehension when
supposes that I used the word
"
project
"
in the sense,
quote his words, of flinging a
"
projectile into the space
outside the body." The projection is of course a purely
lental process and this requires a brief explanation.
Few people are aware of the wonderful nature of vision. The
ibres of the optic nerve transmit to a certain part of the brain
vast number of distinct and almost infinitesimal impressions,
lade on the rods and cones of the retina of each eye, by
le minute inverted retinal image of an external object. Here
ir actual knowledge ceases, but we are led to infer that these
itinal impressions create a multitude of separate molecular
listurbances in a certain tract of brain cells, the optic ganglia,
fothing could be more unlike the external object and yet
ir ego collects all these varied molecular -
movements into a
)herent whole and forthwith projects, or refers according to
r.
Hyslop, into external space a phantasm, a single erect
lage of the object seen.
Experience has taught us to project mentally each point of
le retinal image along lines passing through and crossing
3h other at the optical centre, or nodal point, of the eye ;
a point about three-quarters of an inch (16 mm.) from the
retina. The image is in fact referred back along lines closely
corresponding to those which the light rays travelled when
entering the eye. Hence the image or phantasm appears
to be erect and of the same size and distance as the object seen.
This is the case with external objects, but the shadows on
the retina of minute objects within the eyeball, such as the
muscae-volitantes, and all entoptic phenomena, are not viewed in
114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1021.
the place and of the size they really exist, but are seen as external
objects. The mind refers the retinal impression not along
the paths taken by the light rays, but projects the impression
through the nodal point of the eye. just as if the minute
internal object were a large external object. The position
and size of the image, or phantasm, is determined by the
ratio of the distance of the nodal point from the retina (16
mm.) to the distance of that point from the surface against
which the entoptic object is seen. For example, looking at
a window 1600 mm. (about 5 ft. 4 in.) from the eye, the
entoptic object will be seen 100 times enlarged and located on
the window.
These entoptic phenomena (which are best seen through a fine
pinhole in a card held close to the eye) appear just as real
and external as if
they were objects outside ourselves. A
phantasm due to a telepathic impression no doubt arises in the
same way, and it would be interesting to know what deter-
mines its size and location. Possibly recollection, and associa-
tion of ideas, so that the phantasm of a distant person appears
of the size and in the clothing we are accustomed to.
This brings me to the last point in Dr. Hyslop's article
He concludes by saying^ that his animadversions
"are only qualifications of inferences that might be drawn from his
[i.e. my] statements and that his [my] idea of projection in visual
perception has the defence that it describes the apparent nature
of the facts."
That is all my statement means. The root of Dr. Hyslop's
criticism is the view he expresses at the conclusion of his
article, but in this view I entirely share. He remarks :
"We may yet ascertain that phantasms [apparitions of the dying
or dead] have causes similar to the experiences of sense perception.
It is possible that the soul is a spiritual body or organism which
duplicates in a transcendental sense the functions characteristic
of the bodily senses ;
and in that case phantasms represent a
reality, though not a material one. In normal experience reality
or objects are synthetic. That is, they represent the union of
properties that may simultaneously affect different senses. . . .
In phantasms this synthetic nature is not so common, and hence
they appear to be more closely related to ordinary illusions or
JINK, H2i. The Genesis of Apparitions. 1 I r>
illucinations, while their more complete development might show
leni to be a replica in the ethereal world of what takes place
the material, and this view would completely remove the
jrplexities of the problem and show analogies between super-
>rmal and normal perception. 1 am far from supposing there is
evidence as yet for this."
But although this view certainly would not remove all
;rplexities, such as the ghosts of clothes and animal pets,
levertheless Dr. Hyslop is mistaken in supposing that there is
no evidence on its behalf. 1 consider that there is much
evidence which cannot be explained away on behalf of an
excursive action of the soul, whether from a living person,
in trance or sleep, or from a discarnate spirit. It may be
that we shall ultimately extend this latter view of apparitions
much more widely than we do at present.
L. 1231. CASE.
A CASE OF INFORMATION CONVEYED BY AUTOMATIC WRITING.
THE following case was sent to us by Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson,
who has been a member of the Society for many years and
was until a few months ago a Member of the Council. The
automatist, Mr. King, has been well known to Mr. Dickinson
and his family for many years.
Mr. King's first statement was made in a letter to Mr.
Dickinson thus :
FINCHLEY, N.3., December 29, 1920.
I promised to send you a few lines telling you of my first
lutomatic writing.
I was on war work and away from home, but on my visits
>ut once every month my wife and I usually had a private
sitting and in that way conversed with my brother (Will) who
was posted missing in August 1917.
One evening while writing a letter to my wife I was holding
my pen on the paper thinking whether there was anything else
I wanted to say before finishing it, when the pen started to
move ; having seen automatic writing once some months before
done through a relative I was not surprised and asked if there
was anybody there who wished to write and the pen wrote
116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1921.
"
yes." I asked for a name and it then wrote
"
Will
"
(the
name of a brother before mentioned). I then asked if he had a
message for me ;
the pen then wrote
"
garden seat at drains,"
it seemed a funny message I couldn't make anything of it, but
sent it on to my wife ;
she could not solve it.
About six months later we had a postcard through the post,
from an old friend of my brother's (Mr. U )
who had lived
in the next house to him (on joining the army my brother let
his house and stored the furniture at two addresses, that we
knew of). The card asked if we knew that Willie had asked a
Mr. Drain (who was then in the army and had lived near Will)
to take care of a seat for him. Mr. U. offered to see Mr. Drain
when he was next home on leave and asked him to look the seat
out, if we approved.
We thanked Mr. U. and felt sure that was the seat my brother
wished us to know about.
A few weeks later Mr. U. had reason to send some things by
a cart to an address near to us, and sent the seat along to our
house at the same time.
The only error is that it is a heavy mahogany hall seat and not
a garden one, though my brother may have used it as such. It
is now in my hall and a very substantial piece of evidence of
human survival.
Yours faithfully,
H. KING.
I am sorry that I destroyed the original writing, but can
vouch for the truth of the above. CLARA H. KING.
On receiving this communication Mr. Dickinson wrote a
letter to Mr. King, putting certain questions which are in-
corporated in Mr. King's reply, which we quote below :
FINCHLEY, N.3., January 18, 1921.
I am sorry for the delay in answering yours of the 5th, but I
have not been able yet to get an introduction to Mr. Drain.
I have never seen him arid do not know his address. So I will
now answer your questions.
(1) Date of your writing ?
Ans. About July 1918.
(2) Did you know at the time or had you ever known the name
of Mr. Drain ?
*
:
1921. Case. 117
Ans. No, I never heard the name till Mr. U - wrote to say
[r. Drain had a seat belonging to my brother.
(3) Did you know anything about the existence of the seat before
ir writing ?
Ans. No, I did not know my brother had it.
I will try and get in touch with Mr. Drain and if successful
II write you again.
I quite understand re subconscious memory, but that was quite
ipossible under the circumstances.
H. KING.
On reading these statements Mrs. Salter wrote to Mr. Dick-
>n asking him to get further information, if
possible, which
kindly did.
Her] letter to Mr. Dickinson was as follows :
It would evidently be impossible to prove that Mr. King's
brother had never mentioned Mr. Drain to him, or the fact that
Mr. Drain was keeping one of his things. But if it is a case of
subconscious memory, it is curious that no conscious recollection
was aroused in Mr. King's mind when he wrote the
"
message."
One would of course like to get a statement from Mr. Drain
that (1) he was given the seat to keep by Mr. King's brother,
and (2) that he had had no communication about it with Mr.
King and did not know Mr. King.
Mr. King says in his second letter to you that he did not
know his brother had this seat. But I suppose he had been to
his brother's house and may have seen it there ? Could you
uestion him on that point ?
It might also be worth asking whether Mr. and Mrs. King
mentioned the receipt of the automatic writing to any one who
could confirm its having been received before they had any
communication with Mr. Drain or Mr. U .
Subsequently Mr. Dickinson forwarded to us a further
etter received from Mr. King, which ran as follows :
FINCHLEY, N.3., March, 1921.
I am sorry to have been so long in replying to yours of the
2nd which contained a letter from Mrs. Salter asking if I could
get certain proofs, etc., re automatic writing. I have been able to
get them, and am enclosing herewith a letter from Mr. Drane J
1
Note change in spelling and see postscript to letter. ED.
118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1921.
and also one from some friends who lived near to where Mrs.
King was staying in Bucks when I received the writing at Enfield.
I did not know my brother had the seat as I did not visit
him. I did cycle over one Sunday, but they were out and I
received no answer. At that time I was living at Enfield, a cross-
country journey from Finchley, where my brother lived.
I think this answers all Mrs. Salter's questions, but should
there be any further questions I shall be pleased to answer them.
H. KING.
P.S. You will note that the spelling in the name of Mr. Drane
is different from the writing. H. K.
Enclosed with Mr. King's letter were (a) a letter from
Mr. Drane to Mr. King, (6) a letter from Mr. and Mrs. R
addressed to Mrs. King, to the effect that she had shown
them the automatic writing before she or Mr. King knew
anything about Mr. Drane. We quote these letters below :
FINCHLEY, N.3., February 23, 1921.
In reply to your letter of the 19th inst., it is the fact that
before he went to the Front, and when he was dismantling his
house, your brother left a mahogany seat in my charge, with
other articles. Further, it is
quite true that I never had any
conversation with you on the subject ; and, indeed, had not the
pleasure of knowing you.
FRANCIS J. DRANE.
WINSLOW, February 28, 1921.
DEAR MRS. KING,
My wife and I remember a conversation we had with
you on the subject of Spiritualism in the summer of 1918, when
you visited us at our cottage in Winslow.
You then told us you had had a message from Mr. King's
brother (who had previously passed into the
"
beyond "), the
purport of the message being that you were to have a garden-seat
that had been his. We are interested to learn of the fulfilment
of this communication, as at the 'time of the message you were
quite ignorant that you were to be the recipient of any such
article. F. M. R.
I can also testify as to the foregoing being entirely accurate.

CORRESPONDENCE
A REMARKABLE CASE OF PRECOGNITION.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
March 1, 1921.
MADAM, Mrs. Chester-Masters, the lady who tells this story,
las been a near neighbour of ours now for the best part of a
year, and I have had many conversations with her. She is an
unusually clear and accurate thinker, her memory is excellent,
and her integrity beyond question. This is what she has written
for me :
About thirty-five years ago my little boy George, then five years
old, ran into my bedroom one morning, at about 8 o'clock, crying
"
Mother, mother, I've had such a dream ! Edith [his younger sister]
and I were out for our walk with Nanny [their nurse]. We had all
the four dogs out with us, and one of them killed a duck, and we
thought it was Frou-frou [the poodle], and the duck came swimming
down the brook with its head under water."
The child was in a state of great excitement, and insisted on telling
his dream before saying his prayers, which according to his daily custom
was the first thing done on coming into my room. They went out for
their walk at 11 o'clock, and on their return both children came tearing
into my boudoir frightfully excited, and called out,
"
Mother, it's all
true ! One of the dogs killed a duck, and it was Frou-frou, and the
duck came swimming down the brook with its head under the water.
Isn't that wonderful ?
"
Their story was confirmed by the nurse in every detail.
(Signed) M. CHESTER-MASTERS.
Mrs. Chester-Master's daughter Edith was asked a few days
;o whether she remembered the occurrence, and she replied
that she remembered it perfectly. The son George is not now,
I believe, in England. It is unfortunate that no written record
was made at the time, but this does not seem to me to impair
the evidence in the least. The occurrence has always been
remembered in the family for its four essential features :
(1)
it was pictured in a dream before it took place ; (2) one of the
dogs killed a duck ; (3) this dog was Frou-frou, the one that
had been specified, though doubtfully ; (4) the duck floated down
stream with its head under water.
In reply to an enquiry Mrs. Chester-Masters told me that she
never remembers the dog chasing ducks at any other time, and
120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1921.
had he done so she would be sure to remember as she kept
ducks herself at the time.
Another of Mrs. Chester-Masters' daughters has psychic gifts.
She writes :
On the 7th of March, 1919, I left my home at Berkhampstead just
after 8.0 a.m., to go by train to London for a day's shopping. I
had a great many things to get, and I did not intend to do anything
else but shopping. When I got out of the train on to the platform
at Euston something almost a voice said to me,
" Leave your shop-
ping, and go home (that is, as I understood it, to my father and
mother) as quickly as possible ; something is wrong." For a few
minutes I walked on and tried to take no notice of it, as I had such
a lot to do, and knew it would take up so much time, going to the
end of London. But it was no good ; the presentiment that something
was wrong became stronger. So I went down to the tube and went
home as quickly as I could. I got to the door, and the maid met me
with, "0, thank goodness you have come ! Your father is dangerously
ill." He had been taken ill suddenly, was unconscious when I arrived,
and died sixteen hours later. My mother had been wishing I were
there. (Signed) V. P.
About an hour ago this same lady, Mrs. P ,
told me of the
following presentiment, which I give as nearly as possible in her
own words.
About seven or eight weeks ago I woke up one morning and at once
said to my husband,
"
Mr. L is going to die." He replied,
"
Don't
talk nonsense," and I said,
"
All right, but I know he is."
Mr. L is another neighbour, whom Mrs. P -
hardly knew.
She had met him on two occasions. He was not ill at the time
mentioned, but fell ill a fortnight or three weeks later, and died
a little more than a fortnight ago. Mrs. P doesn't remember
any dream ;
she simply felt that she was expressing something
in her mind. Her husband, Capt. P ,
confirms her statement
thus :
March 4, 1921.
My wife's statement that on waking one morning some seven or
eight weeks ago she told me that Mr. L was going to die is correct.

CASES.
THE following incidents are all cases in which veridical informa-
tion was given at sittings with a trance-medium which was
unknown at the time to the sitter. The names and addresses
of all the persons concerned are known to the Society, but
in some instances pseudonyms or initials are used here.
L. 1232. I. THE CASE OF CHARLEY L .
(a) Extract from the Rev. W. S. Irving 's
Sitting with
Mrs. Brittain, July 19, 1920.
[This was the first sitting Mr. Irving had with Mrs. Brittain.
He made the appointment under a pseudonym and gave as his
address the Rooms of the Society, of which he is a member, so
that the medium should have no clue to his identity. The pur-
porting communicator during the greater part of Mr. Irving's
sitting was his wife, and a good deal of evidence of identity
was obtained. The records in this and in the subsequent sitting
are quoted from the notes made at the sitting.]
MRS. BRITTAIN (in trance). Is her [communicator's] sister Lizzie
or Lily ?
W. S. I. No.
[Then, after a sentence or two referring to other matters :
]
MRS. B. Who does she call Charley ? One of the boys in the
choir who went to war, was missing and lost. She was
JII.Y, 1921. CftM: The Case of Charley L . 123
very sympathetic to the mothers who lost their boys
in the war.
(h) Extract from Mr. Irving''s Second Sitting with
Mrs. Brittain, September 21, 1920.
[Mr. Irving was still anonymous to Mrs. Brittain and the
communicator was again his wife.]
[RS. BRITTAIN. There is a special boy here passed over in the
war, called Charley. He was in the choir. He was not
a tall boy, rather squat, rather delicate. They took
him three times to - -
[no name given], they took him
for clerical work and then put him in the trenches.
W. S. I. In what parish did he work ?
MRS. B. Sounds like St. Michael's W, Wish Wis it begins
with W. He comes to ask Lizzie. Do you know Lizzie,
Lizzie, Lizzie B. ? A relation, a sister-in-law or sister.
W. S. I. You said that before.
MRS. B. Her sister. There is a sister Elizabeth, Sister Betsy,
Elizabeth. The boy is connected, or a personal friend
of Sister Elizabeth.
W. S. I. Is Sister Elizabeth on their side ?
MRS. B. On their side, on their side (vaguely muttered). This
boy used to have a long taper and light the candles in
church. Looked like an angel in white robes, she says,
but was not an angel inside. He was white outside,
she says, but black inside. He had rough, red hair.
The people were in church at the time he used to light
the candles. That's not right, must light the candles
before the people come. No, she says, light the candles
when the people were in church. He used to walk up
like a little cherub. She says when you remember it
will be something to put the cap on.
It will be observed that at the first sitting on July 19,
1920, a reference to a supposed sister of the communicator
called Lizzie or Lily is followed almost immediately by a
reference to a choir-boy called Charley. Commenting upon
these statements in his notes to the sitting Mr. Irving says
that of his wife's four sisters none was called Lizzie or Lily
and that the choir boy Charley is unidentified. At the
124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.
second sitting, on September 21, 1920, a good many further
details are given concerning Charley, including a statement that
he worked in St. Michael's Parish, and Lizzie, who in the
first sitting appeared as a sister of the communicator, emerges
as a Sister Elizabeth connected in some way with Charley.
Commenting upon this Mr. Irving says ;
We used to know a Sister Elizabeth. I have not seen her
for six years, nor had I heard of her for some time. She was
connected with a church, St. Michael's, Wheatcroft. I wrote
to her asking if she knew a choir boy server at St. Michael's,
described as above. She answered by post card : "I do not
remember anyone of that description, but I am making full
enquiries and will write." A week later she wrote : "I rather
think I have found the clue, Charley L -
[name of the regi-
ment given]. They heard he was killed, but nothing more. . . .
He had the hair you described and, I believe, was threatened
with lung trouble.
[Mr. Irving continues.] The candles at St. Michael's are lit
as described. Years ago I was connected for a short time with
that church myself.
This last statement Mr. Irving amplified in a letter to
Miss Newton, dated September 27, 1920 :
My wife and I were associated with that church [St. Michael's,
Wheatcroft] for three months in about 1909, so the boy [Charley]
might know us. I was Curate (temporary) there.1
As it now appeared that the whole incident might be of
considerable interest and importance, Miss Newton, who had
been in communication with Mr. Irving, urged him to obtain
further corroboration if
possible. This Mr. Irving proceeded
to do, giving himself much trouble in the matter, fortunately
with satisfactory results.
A considerable number of letters received by Mr. Irving are
in our possession, but it does not appear necessary to include
them all
in'Jthis report. An element of confusion was intro-
duced at one point by the fact that in one letter a description
of Charley L was given which did not altogether tally
with other descriptions, including that which was given at
1
It was subsequently ascertained that Charley L had left Wheatcroft
before Mr. Irving went there (see below).
The Case of Charley L . 125
: :
the sitting of September 21, 1920. But the writer of this
letter, according to his own statement, only
"
knew slightly a
young man named Charley L ," and it appears to be
uncertain whether he was describing Charley or one of his
brothers. By far the most important and detailed statement
about Charley was received from Mr. C. H. Fletcher, a lay reader
at Scarborough, who was well acquainted with him for many
years. Mr. Fletcher's statement, which is quoted in full
below, was written in the form of replies to a series of ques-
tions put to him by Mr. Irving. His statement was enclosed
in a letter to Mr. Irving dated November 13, 1920.
MR. FLETCHER'S STATEMENT.
November 13, 1920.
Did you know Charley L if
Very well indeed.
Did he attend St. Michael's Church, Wheatcroft? Yes.
Was he in the Choir ? Yes, as boy and young man.
Did he light the Altar Candles '/
Very often on Sunday Evenings.
About how long did you know him for ? From being a boy of
about 11 or 12 until he left England for the last time, a
month or two before he was reported missing.
Was he tall, short, or medium in height? Medium height.
Strong or delicate ? Not very strong, but could not exactly be
called delicate.
What colour was his hair ? Reddish sandy colour.
Do you know what date (approx.) he left Scarborough ? Not exactly,
but about 14 or 15 years ago for Canada.
Where did he go to ? Worked at Calgary as a joiner at first,
joined the S. Andrew's Brotherhood and was very keen on
my starting it at S. Martin's, often writing to me on the
subject. Later on did some farm work.
Was he called up when war broke out ? Joined and came over
with a Canadian Regiment (I believe of Engineers).
Do you know what happened to him? Was, I believe, given some
kind of office work at intervals, but from what he told me
had had a rather rough time altogether.
Was he killed ? So I was told missing according to W.O. tele-
gram.
126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.
Have you definite proof of the last point [i.e. of his beiny killed}?
No.
Anything else you may remember about him ? He was always a
nice lad and when a boy not good looking, just a freckled,
tousely haired mischievous youth, but thoroughly good and
dependable, and when he grew up was much the same only
broader and more manly. A most kindly affectionate fellow.
[Signed] C. HARTLEY-FLETCHEK.
A statement about Charley L was also obtained from
the Rev. A. S - thus :
October 26, 1920.
I knew Charles L --
very well, as he was out in Canada,
at Calgary, when I was in S. Alberta, and he often used to
come and see me when I went up to Calgary. He was a thin
red-faced young fellow with sandy hair and pale eyes and slow
of speech with a strong E. Riding accent. ... So far as 1
remember he was never a server at Wheatcroft. Albert F
was the only server, though Charley L -
frequently went to
church at St. Michael's.
It will be seen that Mr. S 's letter corroborates Mr.
Fletcher's in regard to the colour of Charley's hair. As to
Mr. S 's statement that Charley was never a server at
Wheatcroft, i.e. the boy who lit the altar-candles, Mr. Irving
in his letter
ofj
October 27, 1920, with which he enclosed
Mr. S 's letter, writes :
At the time Mr. S was in Scarborough, Charley was at
the Parish Church, not Wheatcroft. Fortunately the Lay-Reader
[Mr. Fletcher] has corroborated the fact that he was a server
at Wheatcroft, probably after Mr. S 's time. He (Mr.
S )
left Scarborough in 1896. . . . One point in Mr. S- 's
letter I consider most valuable. He corroborates my statement
[made in an earlier letter, not quoted here] that there would
probably not be more than one server at a time at Wheatcroft,
lessening chance as being a possibility enormously.
With regard to the element of doubt in regard to Charley
L 's death, it appears to be humanly speaking certain
that he was dead at the time of Mr. Irving's first sitting ;
he
had been reported missing prior to that date. Mr. Irving
{JULY, 1921. Caw: The Case of Charley L . 127
received a letter from the present Vicar of St. Martin's,
Scarborough, stating that
"
C. L.'s name is on (tin- Parish]
memorial-list at the request of his sister who is a parishioner."
To sum up :
Putting together what was said at Mr. Irving's
two sittings we get the following statement :
The purporting communicator is
represented as anxious to
bring to the sitter's notice a former choir-boy called Charley,
now dead. Concerning Charley it is said that
(1) he was connected with a Sister Elizabeth ;
(2) he went to the war, was missing and lost ;
(3) they
"
took him for clerical work, and then put him
in the trenches
"
;
(1) he was not a tall boy, rather squat, rather delicate ;
he had rough, red hair ;
(5) he worked in a parish named St. Michael's connected
with a name beginning with the letter W, Wish ,
Wis ;
(6) he used to have a long taper and light the candles
in church in the presence of the congregation.
All these statements are confirmed more or less exactly by
the evidence about Charley L which Mr. Irving has
been able to collect.
Charley L - was a choir-boy in the Parish of St. Michael's,
Wheatcroft ;
he was also a server, i.e. he used to light the
altar-candles ;
he was known to a Sister Elizabeth, who worked
in the same parish. As to his appearance we are told by Mr.
Fletcher that he was of medium height, not very strong,
but could not be called delicate ;
his hair was of a reddish,
sandy colour,
"
tousely." According to Mr. S he
a thin young fellow with sandy hair. When the war
broke out he joined a Canadian Regiment, and came over
to England. He "
was given some kind of office work at
intervals," went to the front and a month or two later he
was reported missing.
As to what part Mr. Irving's normal knowledge may have
played in the matter, it is to be observed that Charley L
had gone to Canada some years before Mr. Irving's temporary
connection with St. Michael's, ^Wheatcroft, in 1909. Neither
Mr. Irving nor his wife knew anything about him. Mr.
128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.
living's recollection of Sister Elizabeth was an important
link in verifying the various statements made at the sitting,
but beyond that it is difficult to see what part his mind
can have played. ./ On the other hand it is extremely difficult
to suppose that so many correct statements could have been
made by chance. If some further explanation than chance
coincidence is to be sought, two possible hypotheses present
themselves ; (1) that Mrs. Brittain obtained her information
telepathically from Mr. Fletcher at one, or perhaps two
removes, through the sitter, Mr. Irving, and Sister Elizabeth ;
(2) that the alleged communicator had in fact got into touch
with Charley L - after his death and obtained her informa-
tion from him.
In view of any question that might be raised concerning
Mrs. Brittain's bona fides, it is worth while to point out that
even if Mr. Irving's anonymity had not been preserved,
a supposition for which we have no evidence at all, there
was still nothing to lead Mrs. Brittain to make enquiries
at Scarborough. Mr. Irving's connexion with Scarborough
was short and long past. He now lives in Gloucestershire.
L. 1233. II. THREE INCIDENTS AT SITTINGS WITH MRS. LEONARD.
The sitter on these occasions was a member of the Society
who is called here Mrs. Drummond. The records of the
sittings are taken from Mrs. Drummond's contemporary notes,
and her verification of the various statements made is corro-
borated by her daughter and son-in-law (see below). Mrs.
Leonard was, as usual, in trance and was
"
controlled
"
by
Feda.
(a) Extract from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting.
FEDA. There is a brass jug something to do with a room, not
connected with that other room [a room in Mrs. Drummond's
house in Edinburgh which had just been spoken of]. A
brass jug and something Japanese in that room, Ian [the
communicator] keeps saying it, Ian is most obstinate. Little
pictures, design in this Japanese thing, design in this. He
is laughing ; you you will see it almost immediately you get
home, quite quickly ; yellow stripes against something dark,
you'd never think of it, but you will find it. The room has
JCLY, 1921. Case : Incidents at Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 1 20
;
two doors, not only the one you go in at, another into a
smaller room. The room has two windows (to communi-
cator) sure not three, Ian ? Feda sees three, Feda's right,
yes, they say three windows now ; they said two and showed
three. A good thing they says and shows too, you can see
what they really mean.
Comment by Mrs. Drummond.
The day after the sitting I went to London to stay with my
daughter in a house which she had taken furnished for six months.
I had never been in the house, as I had gone straight from
Edinburgh to Datchet [where Mrs. Leonard was then living].
When the description of the room was given, I thought Feda
had not given the message accurately, as she had been discussing
my house in Edinburgh and although she said it was
"
not
connected with that other room," I still thought of the Edinburgh
house. When I got to my daughter's house in London, I never
thought of examining any of the rooms till
my son-in-law said
to me :
"
Aren't these curious Japanese pictures ?
"
I at once
thought of the description and examined the pictures. There
were two curious needlework pictures, one the figure of a Japanese
man, the other of a Japanese woman, worked in yellow silk
on dark brown silk, the outlines of the figures worked in yellow
silk in large slanting stitches which from a distance looked like
"
yellow stripes." The room had two doors, but only one was
used ;
the other
"
into a smaller room
"
was blocked up by a
table and palm.
The
"
brass jug
"
was a large pewter jug which stood on the
floor almost opposite the door that was used, and would, probably
be seen at once by anyone entering the room.
The above verification is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's
daughter, thus :
I guarantee the above to be correct ;
the notes were read
to me at the time. M. L.
The above incident had a sequel which is worth recording.
Mrs. Drummond sent her report of it to the Society on
March 14, 1921, and on March 16, 1921, she had another
sitting with Mrs. Leonard concerning which she wrote to
Mrs. Salter thus :
130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.
HAVANT, March 20 [1921].
I don't know if the following sequel to the Japanese picture,
etc., will be of any use. I had a table sitting
1
with Mrs. Leonard
on 16th March, 1921, and in the middle of the sitting she said :
"I see your son so clearly to-day and he is walking about the
room. Now he is going up to that little plant and touching
it." (The
"
plant
"
was a tiny rock garden or Japanese garden
which stood on the piano.) I said :
"
Yes, I understand."
(I have a small Japanese garden which since I left Edinburgh
in January, 1920, has been kept for me there by an old house-
maid. About six weeks ago I sent for it and have it here
now.) Then Mrs. Leonard said :
"
Now he is touching the
centre figure in the tapestry." We both looked at it and she
said :
"
no, it is the figure next the centre figure." This was
a figure of a Japanese or Chinese boy, and I said I understood
why this was being pointed out, and the table, without anything
more being said about it, spelt out :
"
It isn't quite the same,
but near enough."
Mrs. Leonard knows nothing at all of the Japanese picture
test being sent to you and I didn't explain why the figure was
pointed out. It was most unexpected and very good. You
probably know the tapestry which is on the back of the piano
in Mrs. Leonard's room. Mrs. Leonard knew nothing at all
about my Japanese garden, of course. L. D. [DKUMMOND].
(b) Extracts from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting, March 9, 1919.
FEDA. This is some one closely connected with the [Anthony] one
[Mrs. Drummond's son-in-law], very close relation, order, bank,
bank, keeps on saying something to do with the [Anthony]
one and the spirit at the sitting [Mrs. Drummond's son-in-law
had been at a
'
direct voice
'
seance], Feda thinks it is
the name of a place, something bank. [Anthony] will help
you ;
bank comes in, the older gentleman told him that.
[Later in the sitting.] Or, or, or [written as pronounced],
this is something to do with a picture of [Anthony]. Noah
(to communicator) do you mean Noah what was in the ark,
Ian ?) No. The gentleman told Ian about a picture of
[Anthony] with an oar, taken some time ago, not lately. Ian
says it is useful to practise for tests.
1
At a "table sitting" messages are received by tilting a table upon Mrs.
Leonard, and the sitters put their hands ; Mrs. Leonard is not in trance.
JULY, 1D21. Case: Incidents at Sittings with Mrs. Leonard. 131
[Later in the sitting.] A little while ago they were worried
about him [Anthony], a change Mrs. [MaryJ [Mrs. Drummond's
daughter] might not like. Somebody whose name begins
with B will have a good deal to do with the [Anthony] one,
something to do with Russia. I can't get it, Ian says
he wants to make an assertion. Russia and [Anthony], some
work connected with his work, [Anthony] linked up with Russia.
(To communicator.) Do you mean now, Ian ? Not at
present, may be more in the near future. [Anthony] should
know now.
Comment by Mrs. Drummond.
I read these notes to my son-in-law when I got back to London
the day of the sitting. He said his father had been in a bank.
Neither I nor my daughter knew this. His father, who had
lived in Australia, died in 1883.
My son-in-law at this time was at the Admiralty, the Board
of Invention and Research, and he had been told he might have
to go out to Russia with some new mines. The name of the
officer associated with him began with B. This was very
"
hush
"
and had never been mentioned either to his wife or to me.
Commander L. corroborates the above statements, and
with regard to the reference to a photograph of himself with
an oar he writes ;
I recognised a photoj of myself about 30 years before. Neither
my wife nor my mother-in-law had seen it. A. L.
(c) Extract from Mrs. Drummond's Sitting, September 27, 1920.
FEDA. This is quite lately, a little round box with something
red in it. You were looking for it, you wanted it ;
it was
in your mind, a small round box and inside something
red. He [the communicator] says :
"
Mum, I could make
you know what that is to-night." In the latter part of
this day Ian is going to remind you of a little round box
with red in it.
Comment by Mrs. Drummond.
I knew the little box spoken of quite well. I thought my
son had given it to my daughter and I would have liked to
have it, and often thought about it, but I couldn't understand
how it could have
"
something red in it." It was a silver and
132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1921.
tortoise-shell box with no lining. When I got back to Havant,
I saw the little box on the tea tray where it had never been
before. I opened it and found it full of
"
Sargol," bright red
tablets, supposed to fatten people. In my absence my daughter
had filled the little box with
"
Sargol." She had taken
"
Sargol
"
before I left, so it was in the house but not in the box.
The above statement is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's
daughter.
CORRESPONDENCE.
ON THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING NAMES THROUGH IN
ALLEGED SPIRIT COMMUNICATIONS.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, The above difficulty is a striking characteristic of very
many alleged spirit communications. The last chapter of Raymond
treats of it in an apologetic manner. A passage in Sir Conan
Doyle's New Revelation suggests it may be purposely introduced by
higher intelligences in order to exercise the human faculties.
With all due deference I offer the opinion that this very difficulty
has, in a way, a certain degree of evidential value. In this
manner :
A meaningless proper name is only a symbolic sound which
cannot be conveyed by thought transference. Take the case of a
Chinaman who has forgotten his phonetic symbols and tries to
write the sounds of a proper name. His ideographs do not
directly serve the purpose, he has no means of representing sounds,
and must necessarily go some very roundabout way to get at it.
His problem is roughly analogous to that of a mind trying to
convey a name without being able to create sounds that will
operate the mechanism of the human ear.
Forms can be mentally communicated by concentration on mental
pictures. We mostly think in pictures; very often quite uncon-
sciously. One method therefore for the communicating mind is
to concentrate on the forms of the letters which serve as symbols
of the sound. This seems to be often tried. That a high degree
of concentration is needed seems to be shown by the frequency
of incomplete names, as if the mind had conveyed only the part
within the focus of concentration. A better way would be to
concentrate on one letter at a time. This seems to be sometimes
done. C. G. PALMER.

NOTICE. EXPERIMENTS IN TELEPATHY.
MR. GARDNER MURPHY, an Associate of the Society, will soon
begin a series of experiments in telepathy at long distance.
He will be in America, and will have the co-operation of
the American Society for Psychical Research ;
but he hopes
especially for the co-operation of persons in Great Britain or
at a greater distance. Members or Associates can give very
material assistance in this work by sending to Mr. Murphy,
at Concord, Massachusetts, U.S.A., the names of persons
apparently possessing telepathic or other supernormal gifts
who would be willing to co-operate in the experiments.
A SERIES OF APPARENT TELEPATHIC COMMUNICA-
TIONS, VARIOUSLY MANIFESTED.
BY HUBERT WALES.
THE name and address of the percipient in these cases, whom
I shall call Miss F., are known to the Society. I became
acquainted with her, as I have with very many people, through
my books. She has never known any of my immediate
friends and relatives, and has never visited at my home.
I related one case in connection with her in a footnote to
my Report on Miss Samuels's phenomena (Proc., Pt. LXXX.,
p. 159). The following are others. They are not, as in
the case of Miss Samuels, selections from a large number
of notes, but are all the accounts of apparently supernormal
experiences that I have received from Miss F., either in
writing or by word of mouth, with the exception of two or
three too indefinite to be of interest, and of one recurrent
impression, about a fire, in which I found nothing significant.
Unless it is otherwise stated, Miss F. was at Watford,
Herts., at the time of the occurrences ;
I was at Hindhead,
Surrey. In September, 1919, however, we removed from the
Long House, Hindhead to Homewood Heath, about a mile
distant.

Extract from letter from Miss F. to H. W. dated
25*7* August, 1919.
[Were you thinking] of me on Sunday afternoon [24 Aug. 1919]
I \vccn 5 and G o'clock? . . . I'll tell you why I ask. I was
uit at some friends and we were all chatting just the usual
lalltea table talk when suddenly I distinctly saw you in front
f mo, just looking at me in a whimsical way that you have,
id I just got
Regarding this as, at most, a subjective hallucination, I
infortunately kept only the above truncated extract from
[iss F.'s letter, cutting out a portion in which I vaguely
icmber she went on to tell me of her sensations and of
ic remarks on her appearance of her friends, who (I think)
LW nothing. Some weeks later, however, I saw Miss F. in
jondon, and she then gave me, spontaneously, in the course
)f conversation, an important evidential detail. I afterwards
sked her to put this into writing, and she did so, in the
following letter, dated 2nd December, 1919 :
DEAR MR. WALES, When I saw you in London on the 7th
Fov. last, I told you that, when I saw the apparition of you,
were wearing a green tie, that this struck me most of any-
bhing about you and that I didn't like it.
You then told me that you always wore a green tie at home,
ilthough I had never seen you in it, because I only saw you
London.
I endorsed this on 3rd December, 1919 :
It is true that I was wearing daily at home, at the time of
lisa F.'s experience, and still am, a green tie, and that she had
10 opportunity of knowing this. The tie is all green and rather
vivid shade.
I. had met Miss F. only twice at the date of this incident, as
lentioned in my contemporary note to the "Wuthering Heights"
of approximately the same date (see Proc., Pt. LXXX.,
159), both times in London, when I most certainly was
lot wearing a green tie. I have never, within my recollection,
rorn such a tie in London,

Extract from, letter from, Miss F. to H. W., received
23rd November, 1919.
And then, strange to say, I got a sudden vision of you, and
I asked you a question, which you answered rather slowly
"
That
you were worried about some papers that were not yours, but
had to do with some money and that you were responsible for."
You had an old golfing coat on, rather shabby.
I endorsed this on the date of receipt :
I have been wearing daily of late a very shabby old coat. It
is provided with slits behind the shoulders for freedom when
playing golf. Some weeks ago I was rather bothered by the
loss of the receipt for a share certificate, for which I was respon-
sible as trustee. [Added 3rd December, 1919] I had suggested
to Miss F. that, if she saw this apparition again, she should try
to get it to tell her something evidential of identity.
[Added 3rd May, 1921] My carelessness in losing the receipt
referred to caused considerable trouble. The Company required
indemnities by Bankers and others, as well as by me, before
they would issue another certificate.
I told Miss F. the substance of the above notes and asked
her for further details of her experience. She replied as
follows (28th November, 1919) :
About the old golfing coat, I really didn't like to say how
it did look to me in the apparition, as I was so afraid of hurting
your feelings by even suggesting that it looked almost disreputable,
because you are such a very tidy man ! Now with regard to
the time I saw you and noticed the coat as far as I remember
it was Monday the 17th [Nov. 1919] and I was sitting alone
in the house in my little sitting room and quietly knitting, and
I suppose I was thinking about you, because I suddenly spoke
the question I told you of in my last letter. [Miss F. had told
me that she had put a question to me, apparently vocally I
think, as to why I had not written and that the phantasm had
r., 1921. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 137
immediately supervened.] As usual, I particularly noticed the
coat. 1
Miss F. had certainly never seen this coat.
III.
In this case, since no precise detail was given, I did not
trouble Miss F. to put her oral statement into writing.
Note by H. W. dated tth February, 1920.
On Thursday, 22nd January, 1920, I met Miss F. in London.
She asked me, in the course of conversation, if I had a lot of
oak furniture in my house, saying that she had received an
impression that I had.
I told her that I certainly had. I have probably, in fact, a
considerably larger proportion of oak furniture than most people,
for an uncle of mine left me specifically all his oak furniture.
Miss F. then added that she had not felt there was oak in my
study at The Long House (which I left in September, 1919), but
that, since I came to Homewood, she had had the impression of
me sitting in a room with oak furniture in it.
I told her that this impression also was correct. My study at
The Long House was lined on two sides with fitment bookshelves
. . . and was only lightly furnished otherwise, without any oak.
My present study, however, is a larger room, and I have three
large pieces of oak furniture in it.
IV.
On 10th July, 1920, Miss F., who had then left her house
it Watford and was living near Uckfield, Sussex, said in a
letter to me ;
"I had a curious experience last night. I did
a little with the old tie so that may account for the result."
1
Compare with these two cases Mr. Piddington's case, Proc., Vol. XVIII.,
p. 182 et seq., also Lady Troubridge's case, Journal, April 1921, p. 78 et seq.
The element common to all four cases is the spontaneous apparition of a
living person who was not, at the time, in any crisis or unusual emotional
state. In Mr. Piddington's case and mine, however, there was probably a sub-
conscious desire to provide evidential matter, and in Lady Troubridge's the
agent was almost certainly thinking of the percipient at the time, in connection
with the plan when the apparition was seen.
Miss F. means by her last sentence, I think, that she particularly noticed
the detail which proved to be evidential.
138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.
(I had given her the old green tie mentioned in Case I., as
a
"
rapport object.")
I asked her, in my reply, to give me particulars of the
experience to which she had referred. This she did in a
letter dated, from the same place, 16th July, 1920, as follows :
Before I go further in that direction I want to tell you about
that sort of waking vision. It seemed to me I was sitting
out in a lovely garden, in a place I didn't know, on a garden
seat, when you came up to me. You seemed 'surprised to see
me, for you said distinctly,
"
What are you doing in this garden ''.
"
and I said,
"
Oh, I was tired, and a Mr. Simms asked me to
come' in and rest, but I don't know where he has gone now."
You asked me what he was, and I said,
"
Didn't notice him
much, only he was dressed in dark clothes and wore a
'
dog
collar '."... I remember noticing in the garden a very jolly
hammock. It was so very vivid that I thought it almost real.
It [is] rather strange, as I cannot recall anyone of the name of
"
Simms," except some people of that name who have a shop,
and I don't know if there is a Mr. Do you know anyone of that
name ?
The name of the vicar of the parish in which my present
house is situated (Grayshott) is Simms spelt as Miss F.
spells it, not
"
Sims," as in the familiar names G. K. Sims,
Sims Reeves and Admiral Sims. I know him well by sight
and voice, and my wife knows him personally and occasionally
attends services at his church.
Before telling Miss F. that the name conveyed anything to
me, I asked her two questions ; first, what she knew about
Grayshott (I knew she was aware that there was a village
of that name in the Hindhead neighbourhood) ; and, second,
what grounds she had for regarding her experience as a
"
waking vision
"
rather than a dream. She replied, on
22nd July, 1920, as follows ;
(i)
I've never been in Grayshott in my life. I certainly
remember asking you some time ago, when in town, if
you
knew it, as by looking at a map I noticed it was somewhere
in your neighbourhood, and at that time I thought of setting
up some tea rooms, and I believe I saw in a paper a small
i. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 139
bage to be had at a place called (Jrayshott. That is all
know about the place.
(ii) About the vision or dream 1 had the other week it was
night after 1 had been in bed for some hours probably
about 2 A.m. I seemed quite awake, although I couldn't open
my eyes, at least I had difficulty in doing so when I was fully
awake and the "dream" had passed. 1 certainly had been
trying to get into communication with you, and then, quite
suddenly, 1 was in a lovely garden, sitting on a seat, it \\a
full afternoon, and I could smell roses, and saw a tennis lawn
and presently I looked up and saw you. You seemed surprised
to see me and asked how I got there. I said,
"
Oh, a Mr. Sim m.,
asked me to come in, as I was tired "...
But what in the world has Grayshott to do with it ?
In a subsequent letter Miss F. added a detail suggesting
that she had been somnambulic during the night. It will
be noticed, as a somewhat curious feature of her dream or
vision as to which her two accounts are consistent that
her interview with the clerical looking Mr. Simms was riot
part of it, but was merely a recollection. She told me, in
the dream, as it seems, something which had occurred before
the dream began ; suggesting that the object of the dream
if one may so put it was the externalizing of this information,
and the further information that I was connected with it.
The case, manifestly, is not evidentially watertight, since
the name could have been obtained from a clerical directory,
or, possibly, from some local publication. It is, perhaps, barely
necessary to add that, personally, I have no doubt that
Miss F. did not deliberately obtain the information in that
way, and that, if she so obtained it casually, she had not the
slightest recollection of the fact.
V.
In this case I cannot quote as much of Miss F.'s original
letter as would be desirable, for it is inextricably entangled
with private matter. I must, therefore, preface the extract
I can give by saying that, on 4th October, 1920, I received
from her a letter, dated 3rd October, in which she told me
that she had slept, the previous night, at the house of some
140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1021.
friends in Watford friends of whose existence I had not
previously been aware. She added that her room at this
house had contained two beds, a double and a single one ;
that she had got into the single one at night, and had found
herself in the double one in the morning a circumstance
manifestly again suggesting somnambulism.
The main object of the letter, however, was to tell me
that, in the course of this night, she had had what she
regarded as a waking sense of my presence auditory and
tactile, but not, this time, visual. But since, as in the
previous case, and in contradistinction to I. and II., the
experience took place at night while she was in bed, there is
difficulty, to my mind, in distinguishing it from a dream.
Miss F. does not appear, however, on this occasion, to have
lost the sense of her actual environment, as she did in the
Simms case. Her letter proceeds :
Oh, I was quite sure it was you, because I asked you to
answer me a question, and you did so. Whether the reply is
true or not you alone can say. I said,
"
I want to have some
proof that it is you. Please tell me your wife's name ?
"
And
you said,
"
Beatrice."
"
Oh," I said,
"
her maiden name ?
"
And you replied,
"
Mac "
and I couldn't get any more. But
please, when you write, don't tell me the end of it, because
I want to get it out of you in my own way and time.
Later in the month of October 1920 Miss F. went to Canada.
On 23rd December I received from her the following note,
dated Toronto, 3rd December :
I shall get a letter or else you are writing one. The old tie
has spoken to me. Can't quite get in touch as I should wish,
but you are quite near you are trying to tell me something.
On the back of this was the following, dated the next
day, 4th December,
"
about 5 p.m." :
Have just come out of a kind of dream trance in which you
are trying to tell me something. I ask you to finish telling
me your wife's name. You are standing by a side table, and
I look through an archway, where I can see a large polished
table which appears set out for a gathering of some kind, might

P., i!>2i. Series of Apparent Telepathic. Communications. 141
be a board meeting, but I notice a large bowl of yellow and
bronze chrysanthemums in the centre, the carpet is a very thick

"
Biscuits.''
am puzzled. You laugh, and I say, "Oh, McFarlane. I want
e other Christian names, please." [I had asked her to try to
get other of my family names.] You try to tell, but I can't
get you. With that I wake.
My wife has three Christian names. That by which she
is always called is Beatrice. Her maiden name was Macfarlane.
This is, of course, the name of a very well-known firm of
biscuit-makers.
This case, striking at the first blush, is, unfortunately,
evidentially leaky in three places. The first is Who's Who.
Since (I think) 1919, my wife's Christian and maiden names
have appeared in this publication. After the receipt of her
Watford letter of 3rd October, 1920, I wrote to Miss F.
suggesting that the knowledge she had obtained (which I had
previously told her was correct, so far as it then went) was
probably derived from some forgotten glance at Who's Who,
and asking her if she could remember any circumstance which
would give support to that hypothesis. I tried so to word
the question I know not with what success as to convey
the impression that, in my opinion, the case would be improved,
if, happily, it should turn out that she had had an oppor-
tunity, some time within the previous few years, to glance
into the unwieldy pages of the popular biographical dictionary,
since we should then have an exceptionally good example
of the emergence, after a long interval, of a submerged memory !
She replied as follows on 6th October, 1920 :
Now ... to answer your question. I can't ever remember
seeing a Who's Who, and the houses where I've stayed are not
the kind to take an interest in [such a publication]. Of course,
I've heard people mention it, ... as they might mention Burke's
Peerage, which would of course have no interest for me.
The second leaky spot is this : One day, in the course of
conversation with Miss F., it came out that her brother had
met, in business, a cousin of mine. This is a cousin with
whom I have never been intimate, and whom I have not
142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.
seen for about fourteen years. It is possible, however, even
probable, that he would know my wife's names (I find I can
remember his wife's Christian name with practical certainty,
but not her maiden name, if I ever heard it) though not
nearly so well as he would know some of the family names
which Miss F. failed to get. And though it is quite likely
that Miss F.'s brother might tell him casually that his sister
knew me, it is a little difficult to imagine him supplying
him, in return, with my wife's Christian and maiden names,
or to suppose that, if he did, Miss F.'s brother would remember
the information and find it of sufficient interest to repeat to
his sister.
The third leaky spot is of a similar kind. Miss F. told
me one day, early in our acquaintance, that she had a colleague
at the War Office (where she worked for some months after
I first met her) who had some distant connection with my
family. It turned out that she was the married daughter
of the second husband of an old friend of my wife's. What the
chances are that the latter's two names or either of them
may have percolated through to her I cannot say. I think
it possible that the surname may have done so, but am
more doubtful about the Christian name. Miss F. did not
give me the impression that she was in any way intimate
with her ;
and the first of her experiences recorded above
did not occur until four or five months after she had left
the War Office.
I am sure, as I said in regard to the Simms matter, that
Miss F. did not, within her recollection, obtain cognizance
of these names by normal means ;
but the possibility that
she may, sometime, have seen or heard them, and have
forgotten, somewhat mars what would otherwise be, I think,
an unusually clear case indicative of telepathic communication ;
and the flaw, I feel, is particularly to be regretted, in view
of the fact that the second part of the surname was obtained
when Miss F. was so far away as Canada.
On the other hand, the manner in which the name was
obtained appears to favour the telepathic hypothesis. It was
not, as will have been seen, all plain sailing. The Christian
and the common prefix of the surname were got without
trouble ;
but then came the difficulty and the stumbling so
[., i!2i. Series of Apparent Telepathic Communications. 143
niliar and so exasperating, in similar circumstances, in
mnection with mediumistic phenomena. This appears to
ive been overcome ultimately by the rather ingenious device,
ipon the part of whatever intelligence was concerned, of
^pressing the word
"
biscuits." Being familiar, this was
)parently easy to get through, and by an obvious association
ideas it pointed to the troublesome surname. Compare
various indications of the same artifice in The Ear of Dionysius
.scripts, e.g.
"
Try her with the David story. She might
get it that way" (Proc., Vol. XXIX., p. 216).
1
Miss F. married a few days after mailing me the note
of 4th December, 1920, and has settled permanently in Canada.
Since that time she has sent me no notes of experiences or
impressions suggestive of the acquisition of information super-
normally from me. Apparently marriage has broken the
rapport !
I may add that I made at no time any conscious effort
to convey information to Miss F. telepathically.
1
Since writing the above I have had an interview with Miss F. (now
Mrs. M.) while on a visit to this country from Canada. She then told
me, for the first time, that, on the occasion of her experience at Watford,
after getting the words
'"
Beatrice
"
and
"
Mac," she had a vision of a
lane a long, green, winding lane which puzzled her ; and, oddly enough,
it continued to puzzle her even at the time when she told me about it,
though she then knew my wife's maiden name. It thus appears that the
intelligence concerned, nearly three months before getting this name under-
stood by means of the association with the word
"
biscuits," had tried to
do so, unsuccessfully, by means of a lane symbol. (Compare the "Merrifield"
incident, Proc., Vol. XVII., p. 208.)
CORRESPONDENCE.
ON CHANCE COINCIDENCE IN BOOK-TESTS.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
April 4, 1921.
MADAM, 1 happened to be discussing
"
book-tests
"
with my
mother yesterday and it occurred to me to try whether a random
selection would give me anything which could be regarded as
evidential in connection with my father, who died some years ago.
1
accordingly selected, quite arbitrarily,
" the seventh book from
the left in the third shelf from the top, page 84, about the
144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1921.
middle of the page." There is only one bookcase in the room
and the book proved to be Scott's Monastery. On turning up
the reference I found, just below the middle of the page, the
words Good luck to your fishing, standing in a line by themselves.
I cannot imagine any reference which would be more perfectly
appropriate to my father than this. He was a passionately
enthusiastic fisherman and his devotion to this pursuit was a
regular family joke. My mother must have used those precise
words to him scores of times when seeing him off on his many
expeditions. So characteristic was this love of angling that the
large pastel portrait of him which hangs just to the right of this
book-case shows him surrounded by fishing tackle.
Eeference to the eighth book (same page and place) gave the
following :
"
Where architectural ornaments are introduced into the garden
about the house . . . raised terraces . . .
flights of steps . . .
etc."
The house in which we lived at the time of my father's death,.
and in which he died, had a sort of raised verandah at the back,
with two flights of steps leading down into the garden.
Examination of the same page in the succeeding eight books,
making ten in all, gave five complete blanks and three partial
successes.
In view of such coincidences as these, of which the first is
extremely striking, and in view of various letters which have
recently appeared in the Spectator and elsewhere, it seems that the-
possibilities of chance coincidence in book-tests might easily be-
under-estimated.
A thorough statistical investigation would be valuable if
anyone
could be found willing to undertake it.
W. WHATELY SMITH.
[NOTE. A short discussion on "
Chance in Book- Tests
"
is included
in an Appendix to Mrs. Sidgwick's Report on Book- Tests (S.P.R.
Proc., Vol. XXXI., p. 379 ff.\. Mrs. Sidgwick points out that the
allowance to be made for chance will vary considerably according to
the exactness of the indications given as to what will be found on the
specified page. Mr. Whately Smith's book-test is of the type in which
the message is only defined as something appropriate to the individual
who is ostensibly sending it a definition which offers a fairly wide
scope. It will, however, be agreed that the degree of appropriateness
in this particular case is striking. ED.]

NOTE ON "
THE CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE."
STUDENTS of the phenomena observed in the presence of the
Rev. W. Stainton Moses will remember that amongst the
spirits who purported to communicate through his mediumship
was a man named Abraham Florentine. An account of this
case is included in F. W. H. Myers' article on
"
The Experi-
ences of W. Stainton Moses
"
published in Vol. XI. of the
Proceedings, pp. 24 ff.
Myers quotes (p. 53) an extract from
Nov.,. 1021. Note on "
The Case of Abraham Florentine." 149
Stainton Moses' notebooks (dated September 1, 1874) in which
an account is given of the supposed communication from
Abraham Florentine, thus :
A new spirit manifested by tilts [of the table]. He gave his
name Abraham Florentine, and he was in the American War of
1812, died August 5th, 1874, aged 83 years 1 month 17 days,
at Brooklyn.
It was ascertained by enquiry in America that the informa-
tion given at the sitting of September 1, 1874, was correct
(op. cit.
pp. 82-86), but apparently no search was made to
ascertain whether any notice of Abraham Florentine's death
had appeared in the American papers at the time.
In consequence of an enquiry recently received, the Secretary,
Miss Newton, wrote a few weeks ago to Mr. E. J. Dingwall,
now in America, to ask whether he could get any information
on this point. The following reply was received from Mr.
Dingwall :
THE ABRAHAM FLORENTINE CASE.
On September 8th, 1921, I visited the New York Public
Library for the purpose of consulting back files of journals which
might contain an obituary notice of Abraham Florentine.
The following journals were consulted : The Brooklyn Daily
Eagle ;
The New York Daily Tribune ;
The New York Times ;
The New York Herald ;
The Sun ;
and the Evening Post. Of these
the first two contained notices of the death of Florentine.
Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Wednesday evening, August 5th, 1874,
Vol. 135, No. 184, p. 3, col. 2.
The entry occurs under the paragraph headed DIED.
FLORENTINE. In Brooklyn, August 5th, after a long, and
painful illness, ABRAHAM FLORENTINE, aged 83 years, 1 month,
and 17 days. A veteran of the war of 1812. Notice of
funeral hereafter.
The New York Daily Tribune, Thursday, August 6th, 1874,
Vol. 34, No. 10,404, p. 5, Col. 6.
The entry again occurs under the paragraph headed DIED.
FLORENTINE. (The entry is the same as in the Brooklyn
Daily Eagle, with the exception that the name Abraham
150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov,. 1921.
Florentine in the second line is in lower case and the last
sentence is omitted.)
No entry occurs as far as I can see in the other journals
consulted.
On September 9th, 1921, I again visited the New York Public
Library for the purpose of discovering if there was any notice
of the funeral as promised in the obituary notice of the Brooklyn
Daily Eagle. The following notice appears :
Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Thursday, August 6th, 1874, Vol. 35,
No. 185, p. 3, col 2.
The entry again occurs under the column DIED.
FLORENTINE. On August 5th, after a lingering illness,
ABRAHAM FLORENTINE, in the 84Jh year of his age. Friends
and relatives invited to attend his funeral Friday afternoon,
August (sic) 7th, at 2.30 o'clock, from Franklin Avenue
Presbyterian Church, Franklin near Myrtle Avenue.
From the above entries (and I cannot find any account of the
funeral itself) it would seem that the information given in the
table tipping was contained in the newspapers at the lime.
Steamers for Europe apparently sailed on the 8th, and so there
would have been time for some one to have seen the entry, if
they had seen one of the newspapers. Perhaps the unusual
name Florentine caught the eye and was registered in the sub-
conscious mind. Modern book tests seem to me to obscure the
matter still further, as it is conceivable that such information
might be derived through abnormal clairvoyant selective powers
on the part of the medium.
. ERIC JOHN DINGWALL.
September 9, 1921.
From the information contained in Mr. Dingwall's statement
it would appear possible that either Stainton Moses himself,
or one of the two friends, Dr. and Mrs. Speer, who took part
in the sitting of September 1, 1874, had actually seen a notice
of Florentine's death, and that the case is one of cryptomnesia.
Proof of this hypothesis is of course impossible to obtain at
the present time. It is, however, possible, to offer some
corroboration of the hypothesis that the source of the know-
ledge shown in the table-tilting, whether normally or super-
normally acquired, was one of the notices of Florentine's death
Nov., 1921. Note on "
The Case of Abraham Florentine" 151
given in an American paper rather than the dead man himself.
It would seem, according to trustworthy information obtained
from various sources in America (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XI.,
pp. 82-86), that the statements contained in the obituary
notices were slightly inaccurate upon one point, and this
inaccuracy is reproduced in the statements obtained at the
sitting.
The age of Abraham Florentine at the time of his death is
given in the obituary notices and also at the sitting as
83 years, 1 month, and 17 days.
In an account of an interview with Florentine's widow
(op. cit. p. 83) it appears that according to her statement he
lad been 83 years old on June 8, 1874, and died on the
following August 5. The interviewer remarks upon this :
It will be observed that while the spirit of Mr. Florentine
states his age to have been eighty-three years, one month, seven-
teen days, according to his widow's account it should be twenfcy-
ren days ;
but this discrepancy is hardly worthy of notice, as
either he or she may here be equally mistaken.
This discrepancy is, however, decidedly
"
worthy of notice
"
when we observe that it is a discrepancy between the actual
age of the man when he died (according to the statement of
his widow) and his age as stated in the m obituary notices (a
discrepancy accounted for by the misprinting of a single
figure) ;
between the statement made in the obituary notices
and the statement made at the sitting of September 1 there
is^no discrepancy at all.
Another point may be mentioned which also suggests that
the source of whatever knowledge Stainton Moses had con-
cerning Abraham Florentine was one of the obituary notices.
In a letter to The Spiritualist (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XI., p. 82)
Stainton Moses gives an account of the sitting of September 1,
1874, in which the following passage occurs:
If I may venture a guess, I should say that Abraham Florentine
was a good soldier, a fighting man not nice to meet, and that he
retains enough of his old impetuosity to rejoice at his liberation
from the body, which (if I may guess again) had become a
burden to him through a painful illness.
A3
152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.
In the two obituary notices quoted by Mr. Dingwall occur
the words
"
after a long and painful illness"
It seems worth while to call attention to these facts, even
after so long a lapse of time, because the case of Abraham
Florentine made some stir when it was first published, and
has since then been quoted as good evidence of communication
from the dead,
1
and so far as we have been able to ascertain
the circumstance of two obituary notices of this man having
appeared in American papers at the time of his death has
never been put on record. It appears evident both from the
article quoted above, and also from a further discussion of
the case of Stainton Moses in Human Personality (Vol. II.,
p. 230) that Myers knew nothing of these obituary notices.

SOME INCIDENTS IN SITTINGS WITH TRANCE-
MEDIUMS.
IN the Journal for last July (Vol. XX., p. 122 ff.) we printed
under the title of
"
The Case of Charley L ," a report of
an incident which occurred at two sittings taken by the
1
See, e.g. Dr. Maxwell's paper on "
Correspondances Croisees et la methode
experimentale
"
(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVI., p. 139). In her reply to Dr.
Maxwell Mrs. Sidgwiek calls attention to the possibility of cryptomnesia
in the Abraham Florentine case (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVI., pp. 385, 386).
2
In a footnote to this passage Myers refers to Podmore's Studies in
Psychical Research. In his discussion of the case of Stainton Moses Podmore
observes (p. 131),
"
We shall find that there is no independent evidence
that the communications were ever received until after such an interval
as would allow of the facts of the death and attendant circumstances being
ascertained from the daily papers. In the case of deaths occurring in
England the interval was usually several days. In the case of Abraham
Florentine, who died in America on 5th August, 1874, the seance at which
the communication was made is described, in the only account we possess
an account written in the December of that year as having taken place
"
last August."
It would seem that Podmore was mistaken in saying that the only account
we have of the incident was written in December, for the extract from
Stainton Moses' note-books, quoted by Myers in his article in our Proceedings
(Vol. XI.), is dated
"
September 1st," and Myers does not suggest any
doubt as to the evidence of its having been written on that day. In any
case the point is not important, for there would have been time between
August 5th, when the first obituary notice appeared, and September 1st
for the paper containing the obituary notice to reach this country.

Rev. W. S. Irving with Mrs. Brittain. We now print some
further incidents in sittings taken by Mr. Irving with Mrs.
Brittain and with Mrs. Leonard.
K
L
Extract from the Rev. W. S. Irving's first Sitting with
Mrs. Leonard, January 25, 1921.
(The contemporary record of the sitting was made by
Oolonel C. E. Baddeley. Mr. Irving made his appointment
with Mrs. Leonard anonymously through this Society, and
a communicator purported to be present, whom he identifies as
his wife.)
FEDA. Is she [Mr. living's wife] interested in a place near a
square ? She gives Feda an idea of a square, as
if she has often gone with you close to that square.
You are going there soon again. Two columns and
railings some trees, not clean fresh trees. She is
going with you there again soon. Will you take a
book theve ?
Something to do with a book. Gives
the idea of a book connected with that place.
W. S. I. Did you say I'm taking a book there ? I've no idea
of doing so.
1
FEDA. You are not taking a book to that place.
(NOTE. The sitter considers that he caused the contra-
diction recorded above about taking a book by inter-
Irupting
witfi a question. The recorder considers that
what was meant by
"
not taking a book to that place
"
was that the book would not be left there'. That was
the meaning conveyed to his mind. At this time
neither sitter nor recorder had any anticipation that
a book-test would be given, it being the sitter's first
visit to Mrs. Leonard.)
EDA. Do you look at pictures there ? Your attention will
be drawn to a picture. It does not seem likely. She

was at once identified by Mr. Irving and
Colonel Baddeley as the Rooms of the S.P.R., 20 Hanover Square, W., which
the description well fits and which Mrs. Leonard has visited. Although
Mrs. Leonard did not know Mr. Irving's name, she knew that he was a
member of the S.P.R.
154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.
says : "I don't want to think only of likely things."
She says : "I am going to make you look at a
picture and there will be something that will seem
a link to you, will have a meaning to you, and you
will know I told you beforehand. You will recognise
it in-stan-taneously." Don't think about it any
more, or you might miss it. . .
(NOTE. The following book-test was given about
twenty minutes later.)
F. Something about a book you have been reading, reading
it quite lately. You put it by another book.
W. S. I. Yes, I have.
F. She is afraid you have. A book you have been
reading.
W. S, L A book or a magazine ?
F. She saw you read it, saw you put it near another
book. Not a very fat one. (Feda marks out a
narrow space with her hands.) Got a sort of picture
on it, part of a circle. You are to look on page 7
and near the bottom of the page is a message
from her to you. It is a reassurance that she can
be with you. Not all the words at the bottom of
the page will fit, but certain words will fit very
definitely. She wants to give you the idea of
spanning something, over-bridging, words that also
convey that as well as what she said before. Higher
up the page something gives her the idea of struggling,
turmoil. It does not matter to us, she says, only
a test. She thought there was a picture facing the
page or very near it. She got the idea of the
Ocean, ships, travelling, very close to this too. She
wants you to find that ; you will recognise it. Look
for it, as she told you. She says you have not got
it here. It is in a room. Feda has not the feeling
of a proper bookcase. It was put down carelessly,
not in order. It is coloured on the back, something
red on the outside, something making a circular shape.
It is not a plain cover, a picture cover which has
got red on it. She's laughing, and says :
"
You
Nov., iu2i. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 155
: :

will find it red, red, red." Don't forget it is not on
a proper book-shelf.
(NoTE. Somewhere here, the exact place is not
recorded, the sitter asked again if it was a magazine,
as he remembered reading several just before leaving
home.}
F. It has not got a stiff cover, it has got a paper cover,
got red and yellow on the cover. It's the second.
If you walked straight to where the books are, it
would be the second you would touch. There is
something brass near them, metal.
What have you got in that room ? It isn't a live
animal, is it ? Have you an animal in that room ?
Will he bite ? He's got teeth. Dora says he's got
two good ones, special long ones. Feda don't want
him much. Live animals don't like people who have
passed over. As well as the live one that can bite
there is also a representation of one. She says :
"
Yes, yes, that is not quite the word I want. It
is only like an imitated one, so it can't bite. Near
this there is some glass.
In his notes to this sitting Mr. Irving records that on his
way to the station immediately afterwards he remarked to
the recorder, Colonel Baddeley, that the only book he could
recall having read lately with a red cover was The Crimson
Tide by Robert Chambers. Colonel Baddeley recalls this
remark, a fact to which Mr. Irving draws attention because
the friend to whom he had written to come to verify the
book test with him did not turn up, and he had to verify
the test alone. With reference to the statements made
as to the position of the book and as to the room in which
it was said to be, Mr. Irving notes that he returned home
on Saturday, January 29, and at once looked in his dining
room for the book.
There were a number of books and magazines carelessly laid
on the sofa. On the left-hand side was a pile of about a dozen
books ;
the second from the top was The Crimson Tide. No
other red-covered book which had been lately read was there,
except a volume of sermons under several other books. Beside
156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.
the sofa, two and a half yards away, was a brass bowl. A dog
is generally in the room, but at the time of the sitting was not
in the house. A photograph of a house and two people, and
including the same dog's photograph, hangs on the wall. It is
under glass.
Some further details concerning the contents of this room
were given at Mr. Irving's second sitting with Mrs. Leonard
(see below, p. 161). With regard to the clear identification
of the book, it should be noted that according to Feda's
statement there was some yellow as well as red on the cover,
and also something which is described as
"
part of a circle,"
"
something making a circular shape." As Miss Newton noted
when she saw The Crimson Tide on February 1, 1921 (see
below), the book is
"
bound in bright red, with a bar of
gold, four by one and a half inches, along the top of the
front of the cover, and the green shield of Boots' Booklovers'
Library at the bottom on the right." This green shield is
heart-shaped, and may be what Feda has in mind when she
refers to something which is
"
part of a circle." But apart
from that the reference to red and yellow would seem to
identify the book pretty clearly. The statement that the book
had a paper cover was incorrect, but, as Mr. Irving
suggests, was very probably due to his pressing Feda upon
the point whether the volume in question was not a maga-
zine. It will be noted that the communicator emphasises
the redness of the book "
you will find it red, red, red."
Not only had the book a red cover, but it was called The
Crimson Tide, and dealt with the Red Terror.
As to the contents of the book, Mr. Irving could not find
anything appropriate on page 7, but on p. 8, which is at
the back of p. 7, the following passage occurs at the bottom
of the page :
"
To meet God unexpectedly is nothing to scare one, is it
Pella ?
"
she urged coaxingly. The other reddened and her eyes
flashed :
"
What God do you mean ?
"
she retorted.
"
// I have
anything to say about my destination after death I shall go where
Love is. And it does not dwell with the God or in the Heaven
that we have been taught to desire and to hope for." The
Swedish girl patted her shoulder and smiled.
NOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. . 157
The words which are italicised above are taken, by Mr.
Irving to be the message to which Feda was referring when
she spoke of a message
"
from her to you
"
and of
"
the idea
of spanning something, over-bridging."
On the upper part of p. 8 there is no very definite and
explicit allusion to struggling and turmoil, but the following
itence may possibly suggest this :
We will show you a monument made of heads and higher
lan the Kremlin."
There are on p. 8 and on neighbouring pages several allusions
rhich might suggest
"
the Ocean, ships, travelling," as, for
stance :
(p. 7)
"
During several hundreds of miles in sleighs Brisson's
constant regret was the absence of ferocious wolves."
(p. 8)
"
Is not America the destination of your long journey ?"
(p. 18)
"
By train, by sleigh, by boat, his quartette floundered
along toward safety."
Summing up the evidence so far considered in regard to
this book-test we may say that whereas there is
good evidence
of knowledge concerning the outward appearance of the test-
book and its position in Mr. Irving's house at the time of
the sitting, the evidence in regard to knowledge of the contents
of the book is marred by the apparent confusion between
page 7 and page 8 at the back of it.

We can now- pass
on to consider the sequel.
1. Statement by Mr. Irving, February 3, 1921.
On Thursday, January 27, I wrote to Miss Newton asking her
give us an appointment, for the purpose of going through the
jcords of some
"
Leonard
"
and
"
Brittain
"
sittings. This she
:indly arranged for Tuesday, February 1st. Half-way through
re study of the evidence given in the first Leonard sitting I
[plained that I must, for evidential reasons, omit some para-
iphs, as they seemed to concern the present and were in the
iture of a test. The passages left out contained all references

to the
"
place near a square
"
and to our being shown a picture
that would seem a link to us. After Miss Newton had com-
pleted her examination of the book test, I began to read to her
sections of a Brittain sitting. I had gone through a few points
of interest when Miss Newton, who meanwhile had been turning
over the pages of the Crimson Tide, asked me to read again
from the Leonard record the reference to turmoil and strife to
see if it referred to the picture that had been mentioned later
as near the page, and also to see if some better solution of the
book-test could not be found. I read the words again, and
then she said to us : "I want you to look at this picture. It's
a pity that this was not opposite the page." We did so, and
found it was the picture forming the frontispiece of the book ;
it was one of struggling and fighting, and represented a young
girl wrenching a flag from a burly Jew, amidst an infuriated
mob. It flashed, I think, into the minds of Colonel Baddeley
and myself simultaneously that we were being shown a picture
that formed a link in the communicator's book-test, purposely
withheld till then, for we exclaimed together :
"
You've done it ;
that's the test !
"
We recognised it instantaneously.
Miss Newton's account of the above interview, written partly
on the same day, February 1, and partly on the day after,
ran as follows :
Mr. Irving read to me the notes of several sittings, including
the notes of the book-test. He brought with him a book, The
Crimson Tide, by Robert Chambers, which was bound in bright
red, with a bar of gold four by one and a half inches along the
top of the front of the cover, and the green shield of Boots'
Booklovers' Library at the bottom on the right. The test referred
to page 7. At the -place indicated, but on the back of the page,
i.e. on page 8, there was an appropriate sentence. An allusion
was made (at the sitting) to something which suggested
"
strug-
gling and turmoil
"
on the same page. I was not convinced
by the paragraph Mr. Irving pointed out to me as fulfilling this
part of the test. There was no picture facing or near the
test page.
Mr. Irving said there was another test, but that he could not
read it then, as he understood it to mean that it referred to
something that would happen at 20 Hanover Square. I did not
NOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 159
connect it with myself, and half suggested that he should read it,
but he said that it referred to something that I was to show him.
I regretted having caused him to tell me so much. He said no
more about it, and I had not the slightest idea of what it was
that I was to show him. I have no recollection of thinking
about this test again until just before the end of the interview,
which lasted nearly two hours.
Some time after Mr. Irving had read the notes of the book-
test I reverted to it, and fetched two books (one a novel) from
the store-room, to look at the contents on pages 7 and 8, to test
the hypothesis of chance-coincidence. I mention this only because
even then I did not recollect that there was another
"
test
"
in which I was to show Mr. Irving something.
Later I picked up The Crimson Tide, and opened it at the
frontispiece. I said :
"
What a pity it is that this is not the
picture r< ;ferred to, for it is unmistakeably a picture of
"
strug-
gling and turmoil."
Shortly before the interview was over I recollected for the first
time the test that had not been read and I asked Mr. Irving
to read it. When he read out that he would be made to look
at a picture, we instantaneously remembered that I had shown
him the picture in The Crimson Tide. I. NEWTON.
Colonel Baddeley was also asked to write out an account
of the interview on February 1, but unfortunately, when
he came to do so, on February 5, his recollection of the
sequence of events was not clear, and in his first statement
he made it appear that Miss Newton had been told that
according to the statement made at the sitting of January 25,
Mr. Irving was to be shown a picture at 20 Hanover Square
before she actually showed him the frontispiece to The Crimson
Tide a material point in the evidence. Both Miss Newton
and Mr. Irving were at variance with Colonel Baddeley upon
this point and in agreement with each other. When this
discrepancy was pointed out to Colonel Baddeley, he wrote
thus in a letter to Miss Newton, dated February 12, 1921 :
I felt very doubtful about that sequence of events, and thought
about it a good deal. My reason for eventually putting down
that we had told you about the picture before you found the
picture in the book, was that I retained the impression that we
160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.
all THREE instantaneously recognised the picture when I exclaimed
"
Why that is the picture we were to be shown here," or words
to that effect.
A reference to the last paragraph of Miss Newton's statement
will show how Colonel Baddeley's mistake arose :
Shortly before the interview was over I recollected for the first
time that the test had not been read and I asked Mr. Irving
to read it. When he read out that he would be made to look
at a picture, we instantaneously remembered that I had shown
him the picture in The Crimson Tide.
This statement shows how it was that when Miss Newton
was told that Mr. Irving was to be shown a picture she, as
well as Mr. Irving and Colonel Baddeley, at once identified
this picture as the frontispiece of The Crimson Tide. Colonel
Baddeley was right in his impression that Miss Newton had
shared in the immediate recognition of this point, but according
to the evidence of Miss Newton herself and of Mr. Irving he
was wrong as to the reason why she had shared in it. Miss
Newton is perfectly clear in her recollection that at the time
when she showed the frontispiece of The Crimson Tide to
Mr. Irving, she had no knowledge of the fact that he was
expecting to be shown a picture, and her report of the inter-
view of February 1, being the most nearly contemporaneous,
is probably the most accurate.
It does, of course, detract something from the evidential
value of the case that in the earlier part of the interview,
before Miss Newton showed Mr. Irving the frontispiece of
The Crimson Tide, she had been told that Mr. Irving was
expecting to be shown something. But there does not seem
to be any reason for supposing that Miss Newton's action
arose out of what she had been told. It arose quite naturally
out of the discussion and Miss Newton's desire to find, if
possible, a more satisfying solution of a particular point in
the test. Indeed, what seems rather curious in this matter,
from an observer's point of view, is not so much that Miss
Newton should instantly have connected the frontispiece with
the allusion in the book-test to
"
struggling and turmoil,"
but that when Mr. Irving verified the book-test he should
himself have overlooked this possible connexion ;
for at the
Nov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 161
sitting of January 25 immediately after the allusion to
struggling and turmoil come the words :
"
She thought there
was a picture facing the page or very near it." It is true
that the picture, being a frontispiece, did not face page 7
(on which the test message was said to be), and was not very
near it (for the book has a long preface), but anything
lore unmistakeably illustrating
"
struggling and turmoil
"
it
rould be hard to find. If the claim of the communicator
it she can in some way control future action is justified
it is expressed in the words : "I am going to make you
look at a picture
"
it is just as easy to suppose that she
Luenced Mr. Irving to overlook the frontispiece when he
verified the book-test from The Crimson Tide on January 29,
to suppose that she influenced Miss Newton to show him
ie picture on February 1. In fact, Mr. Irving's action, or
ither inaction, was the real crux of the matter ;
from that
it may be said that the other events followed in a natural
[uence, and something of this sort was doubtless what
[r.
Irving had in his mind when he wrote in his account
)f his interview with Miss Newton :
"
We were being shown
picture which formed a link in the communicator's book-
st, purposely withheld till then."
As has been mentioned above, at Mr. Irving's second sitting
dth Mrs. Leonard on January 27, 1921, some further knowledge
ras shown concerning the contents of the room in which the
it-book was lying.
Extract from the Sitting of January 27, 1921.
FEDA. You have got a thing like a snake you have nasty
things in your room it looks like a snake to Feda,
but Dora [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] says it's
quite nice, so Feda thinks it's all right. Is that
a piece of stone in your room ? It looks like a
lump of stone, a little one, lying on top of some-
thing, lower than a shelf (Feda indicates about
3 feet from the floor), in the same room as the
white snake.
W. S. I. White snake ?
F. She says :
"
Not a white snake, a wide snake, not
162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.
white, it goes fatter in the middle. In the same
room as the piece of stone. Will you look ?
Note by Mr. Irving.
On the mantel-shelf [of the room in which the test-book was
found] is a large vase of green Leckhampton stone, 8| inches
in height, by 7 inches in width at the base. Two snakes are
climbing the vase, one on each side. Only one can be seen at a
time when the vase is on the shelf. Each snake is 14 inches in
length, green and black in colour, and rather formidable in appear-
ance ; nearly an inch in diameter at the thickest part.
The piece of stone took some rinding. It proved to be in a
drawer, about three feet from the ground, and resting on a bit
of silk. A small stone, If inches by 1| by f deep, a pebble used
in weighing things in cooking.
In subsequent sittings which Mr. Irving had, the medium being
in some cases Mrs. Leonard and in others Mrs. Brittain,
further statements were made, deriving ostensibly from the
same communicator, Mr. Irving's wife, which seem to show
knowledge of matters unknown to Mr. Irving at the time.
There were also some further incidents which fall into line
with the picture incident described above, the communicator
claiming to have some foreknowledge of, and some control
over future events, a claim which the events seem to justify.
A peculiarity which is noteworthy in the results obtained by
Mr. Irving is that on several occasions we find between state-
ments made by Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain respectively just
that kind of relation which might be expected if the same
intelligence were communicating through both mediums and
endeavouring in this way to give evidence of her identity.
In order to make these points clear it will be necessary to
quote at some length from various sittings at which Mr. Irving
was present, and from his notes upon these sittings.
II.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs. Brittain, April 14, 1921.
(The sitter was Mr. Irving, the recorder Colonel Baddeleyf;
both were anonymous to Mrs. Brittain. During part of the
NOV., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 1 63
sitting Mrs. Brittain was in trance, and her usual control
"
Belle
"
was purporting to speak through her.)
BELLE When you are reading you pay no attention to what
you read, you will glance up at the window, . . . the
long window that goes down to the ground. The
window pushes out, it does not open top and bottom.
. . . There is a path outside that window. . . .
Just in front of that window there is a bush, like a
round bush, a hedge or bush, not a wall, a round
bush like a laurel or a rhododendron bush. ... It
is in that room where she likes to come. It is
home. There is a picture of her in it. ... She is
making my eyes ache giving me a test. Where the
room with the window is, there is at the bottom a
book, a red one. It isn't a big one, in shape, but
a thick one. Something belonging to her in that
book, which she put in, looks like something that
crinkled up, a dead rose or a leaf. It does not
look as if the book were in a book-case, it is as if
taken down and left down. There is something
special about it. I don't think it's a picture. It
looks like a flower. There is something else.
(Now came a long pause, and the medium began to whisper
indistinctly, it seemed like the beginning of a direct control.
Then the medium woke up and began to speak clairvoyantly.)
[RS. BRITTAIN. Somebody has been trying to talk to you instead
of Belle. Belle is cross. Never mind. Just a
minute. I don't know what they are trying to do.
Belle is not content, she is cross with herself. . . .
She had gone away to see for herself about the book,
like a dictionary, with something in it, and some one
came. There was something in it to do with the
spirit lady connected with you. Something she was
looking up when she passed away. Belle says she
can see nothing 'herself.
Note by Mr. Irving.
The room is the same as that described through Mrs. Leonard,

Crimson Tide

details are correct, a French window opening outward, path outside
the window, round evergreen bush, across the lawn, nearly opposite
the window. There is a large picture of the communicator in the
room, also many smaller ones.
On returning home on April 15, 1921, I hunted for the book,
which I had recognised from Mrs. Brittain's clairvoyance as the
communicator's copy of Cassell's Pocket English Dictionary. I first
looked on the sofa, where I leave a number of books scattered
about, and where The Crimson Tide was found ;
it was not there.
The description of the book's whereabouts
"
at the bottom
"
was
rather vague, but the place where I found it answers well to the
description given. As I have no proper book-case in my dining-
room, I keep a number of books in a row on the top of my
writing-desk. There being more books there than the top of the
desk will hold, I have piled some up on the right-hand side, and
it was near the bottom of the pile that the dictionary proved
to be. The desk is about 5 feet from the French window.
(Mr. Irving then gives a drawing to show that the dictionary
was the ninth book from the top in a pile of eleven books lying
horizontally on the top of the writing-desk.)
It is a small red book, only 4f inches by 3J, and f inches
thick, 452 pages. The book was probably placed by myself some
weeks before at the top of the pile, and had gradually got into
the position in which I found it by other books beneath being
pulled out for use and then placed above it. I do not often
consult the dictionary. I found nothing in it, but after carefully
examining it found that the bottom leaf of page 62 was turned
up to mark the place. This cannot, I think, have ever been done
by me, as when I turn down a leaf in a book I turn down the
top right-hand corner. I had not consciously noticed the leaf
turned up before. It is almost certain .that this had been done
by the communicator, as few people have access to my books.
The dictionary does not open at the place, if picked up and
opened casually the leaves are so thin.
With regard to his statement that the turning down of the
leaf was probably done by the communicator, Mr. Irving
subsequently wrote in a letter dated May 4, 1921, thus :
I was running through the list of words on page 62 of the
Dictionary this morning to see if I could get any clue as to
Nov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance,-Mediums. 165
what was being looked up, and came to the word
"
cantilever."
This reminded me that 12 months ago I had a man staying with
me (Mr. Grundy) who was deeply interested in Dr. Crawford's
experiments and his cantilever theory. We discussed it at length,
and it is
quite likely that the meaning of the word was looked
up. He may, for all I know, have turned up the leaf. Had I
known this when sending in the record, I should certainly not
have worded my note so strongly as to the probability of the
page having been turned up by my wife.
Later on it was suggested to Mr. Irving that he should
write to Mr. Grundy and enquire whether the latter could
throw any light on the questions whether he had turned up
a leaf in Cassell's Dictionary. Mr. Grundy replied as follows :
September 30, 1921.
... It is very hard to recall actions which, as you know, may
have been almost automatic at the time.
I do not often use dictionaries and would not normally look up
the word
"
cantilever." But it is quite possible that I did so
when staying at your house, especially if the book was in my
bedroom. [It was not. W. S. I.], to verify the use of the term
as found in Crawford's book, which I had probably been recently
reading. . . .
I do not think I should consciously turn down the leaves of
another's book, but I do so invariably with my own books,, on
the page which I am actually reading and at the top of the page.
With a dictionary I might turn down the bottom corner, but
probably only if the word desired were near that corner, i.e. about
one or two inches from the bottom. [The word
"
cantilever
"
is the 4th word from the top in the left-hand column of my
dictionary. W. S. I.]
It would seem from Mr. Grundy's statement that it is
unlikely he was the person who turned up page 62 of the
Dictionary at the bottom. It is of course impossible to prove
that it was turned up by the communicator. The statements
made at the sitting with Mrs. Brittain were, however, correct
in regard to the general appearance of the book, its position
(approximately) in Mr. Irving's dining-room., and the fact
of its being a dictionary. The statement that there was a
rose or leaf crumpled up inside the book was not correct.
166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.,1921.
It is possible that there was some misinterpretation here on
the part of the medium or of her
"
control," and that reference
was intended to the leaf of the book, not to a leaf enclosed
in it.
Mr. Irving draws attention in his notes to several points
of connexion between this book-test and the test concerning
The Crimson Tide given through Mrs. Leonard :
(1) In each case the same room is chosen, Mr. Irving's
dining-room, but the details given in regard to the
room are complementary, there is no repetition.
(2) In each case the book chosen was a red 1
book.
(3) In each case the book is taken from amongst some
that were lying about in the room, not standing in
book-shelves.
In most houses some books will be found lying about, but
it would seem from Mr. Irving's notes that it is rather a habit
of his to keep books in this way, and it is therefore of some
interest to find that this habit is apparently taken into account
at the sittings with both mediums.
III.
The following incident is a case in which there seems to
be evidence of continued memory on the part of the com-
municator. The facts referred to at the sitting were not
within the conscious knowledge of the sitter.
Extract from Mr. Irving's second Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
January 27, 1921.
FEDA. Do you know what she [the communicator, Mr. Irving's
wife] means by the little bag you should have of
hers ? Not a leather one, she is speaking of a
stuff one, a material one, and Feda sees that it is
narrower at the top than at the bottom. She gets
1
At Mr. Irving's second sitting with Mrs. Leonard, January 27, 1921, Feda
said: "Will you put for her yellow or red, she can see it more easily. She
wants a red rose. . . . She was very fond of red roses. She can see red
easily."
And at his sitting with Mrs. Brittain on September 11, 1921, it was said:
"She [the communicator] has brought you a great lot of crimson roses."
Nov., 1021. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 167
the idea of something weighting it at the bottom a
little. Now she is pretending to open it, it is lighter
colour inside than outside. She wants you to put
your hand in it, because she thinks there is some-
thing loose at the bottom of it, as if you could pull
away a bit of the stuff inside. Now, she says, she
thought of this bag before any other because she was
looking among her things for a receipt. It is not
in this bag, it is in another one she used more when
she went out. The receipt is in a bag of hers, it
looks to Feda very small ;
she is trying to draw the
figure 9 which is on it.
W. S. I. On the receipt or on the bag ?
F. On the receipt. She would not have the Vicar's mind
on the bag. Will you please look for that ? It is
on the receipt, she is not sure if it is legible, but
she hopes so. It will be sufficient for you to see it.
It will remind you of something she was very
particular about, and fond of.
Note by Mr. Irving.
To-day, Feb. 7th, 1921, I tried to find the receipt stated in the
Leonard record to be in a bag belonging to the communicator.
I found four bags of hers that I still have. One as described
first, a material one, lighter inside than out. It contained
nothing but a small piece of dark material loose at the bottom
of the bag. Of the other three, which were of the type ladies
take with them out of doors, one was empty, one had a littl?
lace and other material in, and the last, a little bag, contained
a small notebook, some loose bits of paper with figures on, and
two bills ;
one receipted for various groceries, and one not receipted
for an Enamelled Stewpan, 4/9.
The communicator, like most people, called stewpans
"
sauce-
pans." She also always called me "
the Vicar
"
when speaking
of me to local people.
On January 26, 1921, that is to say, the day before the
Leonard sitting quoted above, Mr. Irving had his first sitting
with Mrs. Brittain, and a statement was made on this occasion
which suggests a rather confused attempt to refer to the
168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1921.
same matter as was referred to in the Leonard sitting of
January 27, 1921.
Extract from Mr. Irving''s
first Sitting with Mrs. Brittain,
January 26, 1921.
MRS. BRITTAIN. She [the communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] used
to come into your room, rush out, spoil more sauce-
pans than she paid for, she did not worry you 'about
it. ... Don't you wish your sweetheart lady buy
you a new pipe ? She just wishes she could wash
your old ones, unscrew them and boil them in a
saucepan. . . . She would like to wash them. . . .
She once spoiled an aluminium saucepan boiling milk.
IV.
The following incident is another case in which statements
made by the communicator concerning future events were
verified.
Extract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
June 8, 1921.
(1) FEDA. And then she [communicator, Mr. Irving's wife] says :
"
I want you to know you're going to see a picture
soon that will remind you of me in my earth life.
I'll influence matters so that you're sure to see it.
I did before, you know."
W. S. I. Yes.
F. Now then, there's something more. This is
something
like a book-test too, from a different place. It's
where Mr. Charley [Colonel Baddeley] stays in London .
It's like a kind of flat, and she says she doesn't
think you go up any stairs to it. You know where
she means now ?
W. S. I. Yes, I do.
[With regard to this book-test, it will suffice to say
here that, when the book to which reference appeared
to be made had been identified, some appropriate
sentences were found in the positions indicated. The
test is chiefly interesting as having been taken from a
room with which the sitter had only a very slight
Nov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 169
acquaintance and which he had not entered for nearly
five months. Similar attempts have been made on
oilier occasions, but only occasionally with success.,]
(2) F. What ? You're going with her where ? To see some
pictures ?
Perhaps he doesn't like pictures ! She
says she's going with you to see some pictures, many
pictures. As if
you're going to be in a place soon
where there are a lot of pictures. Not in Psychical
Searchers' rooms. No ! Different kind of place
altogether. Because there's something there she
wants to make you look at there, a picture, that,
when you see it, will remind you of the sitting to-day,
of the fact of her coming to you. She'll be able
to impress you immediately to look at the right one.
There'll only be one that will fit it.
Notes by Mr. Irving.
(1) During my visit to town I stayed with Mr. and Mrs.
Whitehead, the father and mother of the communicator. On
coming down to breakfast on the morning of June 9th, the day
after the sitting, I found the breakfast-room empty, and, while
waiting for the others to come down, saw a large cabinet photo-
graph of my wife on the mantel-shelf. No mention had been
made to me of this photograph on this visit, though two months
before Mrs. Whitehead had told me that she believed she had
one somewhere that I might not have seen before. She had
found it on the previous day, during my absence at the sitting,
and placed it where I found it for me to see. It had been taken
nearly thirty years before.
(2) On Thursday evening, June 9th, getting back from town
earlier than I expected, I went into a Cinema, the one almost
next door to the
"
Hippodrome
"
at Catford. The second film
shown was
' '
The Devil's Claim,' featuring Sessue Hayakawa."
One scene was of a man visiting a
"
seer," apparently a female
trance-medium. The sitting was shown on the film ; medium on
a sofa, apparently in trance, sitter, but no notetaker. There was
also what appeared to be a semi-materialisation. I had not looked
to see what films were being shown before going, nor could
anything of a spiritualistic nature have been suggested to me by
the posters, had I looked at them. I went round next day to
170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.
see. I had read no review of this film, and believe it was the
first day it was shown there, Thursday. It was apparently
American in origin. Though frequently I go to Cinemas, I
cannot recall having seen before any sitting shown so strongly
resembling in certain points an ordinary trance-sitting.
Mr. Irving has sent us corroborative statements from Mrs.
Whitehead, and from the Manageress of the Cinema, but it
does not appear necessary to print these statements here.
They bear out what Mr. Irving has said in all essentials,
and in particular the statement from the Manageress confirms
his impression that the film in question,
"
The Devil's Claim,"
was shown at that particular Cinema for the first time on
June 9, 1921, the day of Mr. Irving's visit.
V.
Extract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Brittain,
April 14, 1921.
BELLE. Have you been a ride in somebody's side-car ? You
did not like it at first ; you did not want to trust
yourself, but after five minutes you did not want to
get out. She [the communicator, Mrs. Irving] was
with you. There was just time to push you in, and
it was difficult to push you out. The man who
drove the car went quick. Was there something
wrong with the speedgear ? He could not get the
clutch in, just mounting near the top of the hill.
W. S. I. Did I get out ?
B. Yes. He thought he'd have to get out as well as you.
Glad you did not get in when it was going. It was
going quicker than you thought. You walked up a
little way. It picked up speed. You did not hurry.
You tried to push it. It was not necessary. . . .
Do you call the man you were with Harry or Harold,
Hibbert, an H or a J, she shows, like a Jimmy.
She loves him for taking you out. . . .
Douglas-Chino.
The Nellie. The blossom was lovely. Did you see the
blossom as you went along ?
Cherry-blossom, and
prune, and apple-blossom, and a lot of flowers.
W. S. J. Was it a fortnight ago ?
Nov., 1921. Incidents in Sittings with Trance-Mediums. 171
What she says is that it was a week ago. It was
a warm day. . . . Did you lose your hat ?
W. S. I. No.
You went along so nice, it created a breeze.
Note by Mr. Irving.
Some thirteen days before 1jhe sitting the Rev. D. G. Jones,
ho had been rcently presented by his parishioners with a motor
rcle and side-car, invited me to go for a long ride in the car.
We went nearly sixty miles. It was my first experience of side-
cars and I was rather nervous for a time owing to the helpless
position the passenger is in, and an uncomfortable doubt as to
le experience of the driver. This proved to be unwarranted.
Part of the ride was through unknown country. Coming to
long hill, Mr. Jones tried to take it on the top gear, as the
igine was running well. The hill was too long, however, and
too steep. Rather more than half-way up he tried to change to
low gear, and missed the clutch, bringing the machine to a halt.
We both got out and he tried to start her from the bank beside
the road, whilst I ran behind and pushed. After several attempts
he succeeded, but as the machine was going too fast, I could
)t get in. Calling out to me that he would wait at the top
he was soon out of sight. I walked about a quarter of a mile
jfore I caught him. It was very hot, a glorious spring day.
'he machine is not a Douglas or a Chino. A part of the ride
ras through woodland, and Mr. Jones called my attention to the
ipple blossoms by the road, flowers were everywhere, and the
jnery grand. At one point we had to go back half a mile
pick up part of the silencer which had been broken off by a
stone, and left behind. I take it that knowledge is shown of our
having had to pick up something in the question
"
Did you lose
your hat ?
"
I was wearing a cap.
The above statement is corroborated by Mr. Jones.
Extract from Mr. Irving's Sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
June 8, 1921.
SDA. Oh, about Jones. (Sotto voce. Jones isn't a nice
name.)
"
Isn't it strange," she says,
"
are you
going to see Jones ? He's interested." Don't try
to place it. She was afraid you'd spoil it.
172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1921.
W. S. I. I've got it ;
excellent.
F. What's he to do with Jones ? She's giving the letter
L. She says :
"
L isn't Jones, he's somebody else,
not you, not Jones, but somebody else, important,
all mixed up with the same thing." Don't think
of that. L may crop up in a conversation soon.
Lewis. It seemed to Feda like Lewis.
Concerning the above extract Mr. Irving wrote to Miss Newton,
thus : June 23, 1921.
If you still have the account of the motor-ride given to me
through Mrs. Brittain on April 14 last, and will compare it with
the enclosed extract from my last sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
I think you will find it interesting.
The one fault in the very correct
"
Brittain
"
account was
the failure to give the name of the man I was with, the
nearest attempt being H or J. Now, two months later, we get
the name given through another medium, and to show that the
"
Jones
"
is not a name mentioned at random, it is coupled with
the name Lewis.
Mr. Jones and Mr. Lewis are two neighbouring clergy, and
both members of the local Clerical Society. A few weeks ago
I was invited to address the members of this Society on psychical
matters. Invited to do so by Mr. Lewis, I was obliged to refuse,
as the date will clash with a visit to town. . . .
Mr. Jones has been interested since I read him the description
of our day's outing ; you will recall that he certified my notes
on that record as accurate. I think there is undoubted evidence
of continuity of thought shown by the communicator through
two mediums, of which I believe we have in the S.P.R. records
none too much evidence ;
so I venture to send it to you.
In the
"
direct
"
control which followed (at the Leonard sitting
of June 8), there was again an allusion to Mr. Jones, who was
mentioned by name.
ERRATUM.
OWING to the misreading of a note in manuscript a misprint
occurred in the last number of the Journal. In the footnote
on p. 137 the last line of the first paragraph should read
"

THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
BY MRS. W. H. SALTER.
first International Congress for Psychical Research was
>rganised by the recently formed Danish Society for Psychical
jsearch, and was held in Copenhagen from August 26 to
jptember 2, 1921. Being a first venture, it made no preten-
QS to any great formality. The idea of the Danish Society,
we were told by their Secretary, Mr. Carl Vett, was merely
give a certain number of representatives from different
>untries the opportunity of meeting one another and establish-
ig a foundation upon which a more systematic scheme for
le holding of future Congresses might be built, if after a
irst experiment this seemed desirable.
In addition to a considerable number of Danish Members
)f the Congress about thirty visitors were present, representing
fourteen different countries, namely, England, America, France,
rermany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Russia,
Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland. A paper by
an Indian was read at the Congress, but the author was not
present himself. It was generally agreed that the attendance
at the Congress was quite as large as could be expected
considering the comparatively short notice that was given, and
the difficulties of foreign travel at the present time. It has
to be remembered that the rates of exchange now obtaining
between the various European countries make travelling
abroad a very serious expense in some cases.

One difficulty which beset the Danish Society when they set.
out to organise the first International Congress was that they
178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.
had no means ready to hand whereby they might get into
touch with psychical researchers in different countries. In a
country such as England, where there is a definite and
organised Society for Psychical Research, the problem was
comparatively simple. But there are other countries, such as
Germany and Italy, where there is a fairly wide-spread interest
in psychical research, but nothing in the way of a Society on
a large scale.
With a view, therefore, to the organisation of the next
Congress it appeared desirable to establish something in the
nature of an International Congress Committee, which should
include representatives of as many different countries as
possible. The principal duty of the Committee as a whole
will be to determine the time and place of the next Congress.
Upon the representatives of each particular country will fall
the task of getting into touch with psychical researchers in
their own country, inviting offers of communications to be
read at the Congress by whatever methods they think best,
and making a selection amongst those which are offered.
The task of organising the detailed arrangements for the
Congress, the provision of hospitality, lecture-halls, etc., will
necessarily fall upon the representatives of the country in
which the Congress is to be held. Upon this point all that
can be said at the moment is that at the conclusion of the
First Congress an invitation was received from the repre-
sentatives of the Institut International de Metapsychique to hold
the second in Paris. Cordial thanks were tendered for the
invitation, and the matter was referred for decision to the
International Congress Committee as soon as it should be
formed.
The names of the representatives of this Society on the
International Committee are the Hon. Everard Feilding, Sir
Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., Mrs. W. II. Salter, and Dr. V. J.
Woolley.
RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE CONGRESS.
At the Business Meeting held on the last day of the Congress
the following Resolutions were passed.
DEC., 1921. International Congress for Psychical Research. 179
I.
1
A Resolution
"
to establish the position of psychical
jsearch in relation to psychology and science in general,"
and to affirm in the name of the Congress that
"
so-called
psychical phenomena ought to be admitted to the domain
of official science, so that they may be subjected to an
impartial scientific criticism aided by all the resources which
official science commands."
This Resolution was proposed by Dr. Sydney Alrutz,
iconded by Mrs. Salter, and afterwards signed by repre-
mtatives of fourteen countries.
2.
1
A Resolution to empower the Congress Committee to
establish a provisional Secretariat, whose duty it shall be to
provide a link between the various national committees with
view to making arrangements for the next Congress.
Proposed by Monsieur Rene Sudre.
3. Resolved : that the proposition that a special committee
be appointed to consider and if possible prepare a standard
glossary of technical terms suited to the needs of psychical
research, and to be employed internationally, is referred to
the General Committee, with recommendation that they put
it into effect and that a report be rendered at the Second
Congress.
Proposed by Dr. Walter Prince.
CASE.
M. Cl. 106.
THE READING OF CLOSED BOOKS APPARENTLY BY CLAIRVOYANCE.
WE print below an interesting report on a case in which
passages from closed books were read apparently by some
supernormal means. The names and addresses of the persons
concerned are known to the Society, but pseudonyms are
used here.
It will be seen that the case has some analogy with the
book-tests obtained through Mrs. Leonard, but whereas in
that instance it is only the general sense of a passage which
is indicated, or at most a word or two of the actual text,
in the present case considerable passages have been written
1
These resolutions were proposed in French.
180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.
down almost verbatim. Another distinguishing feature of this
case as compared with that of Mrs. Leonard is that, ostensibly
at any rate, there is no question here of any discarnate agent.
The percipient inclines to the opinion that she becomes directly
aware of the contents of the books by means of some super-
normal power inherent in herself, the exercise of which involves
some strain and fatigue.
It is to be observed that in two of the instances quoted
below, those of Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics and the A.B.C.
Time-Table, the book was selected by the observer, whom we
will call Mr. Brook, and a fairly long passage from it was
written down by the percipient, whom we will call Mrs.
Jackson, almost immediately afterwards, in the observer's
presence, neither of them having in the meantime quitted the
room. These circumstances appear to rule out both cryptomnesia
and any opportunity of examining the contents of the book
concerned after its selection for the purposes of the test. It
seems advisable to draw attention to this fact in view of the
very remarkable nature of the phenomena involved.
Since Mrs. Jackson and Mr. Brook prefer to remain
anonymous, it need only be said that both are known personally
to several members of the S.P.R. Council, and Mr. Brook, who
is a man of high professional standing, is a member of the
Society. Mrs. Jackson's psychic powers are of comparatively
recent development, and she has never made use of them
professionally.
The first detailed report we received of this case was con-
tained in a letter from Mr. Brook to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :
May, 17, 1921.
After reading your most interesting paper in the April Number
of the Proceedings of the S.P.R. on
"
Book-Tests," I venture to
send you the results of certain quasi book-tests obtained with or
through my sister-in-law, [Mrs. Jackson], who has for some time
kept house for me during my wife's last illness, and since my
wife's death. I may premise that [Mrs. Jackson], who is well
known to Sir William Barrett and the Hon. Everard Feilding,
has a fair general knowledge of literature, but no specialised
knowledge of Law or Moral Philosophy ;
she has psychic powers,
which have taken various forms, but these, owing to a break-down
in her health, have for some time ceased.
DEC., 1921. Case. 181
In December, 1919, from one or two things which [Mrs. Jackson]
had done, it occurred to me that she might possibly have some
supernormal knowledge of the contents of a book of which
normally she could know nothing. On Dec. 3, 1919, as we were
sitting alone in my library, I therefore indicated to her a volume
on my shelves Professor Sidgwick's Methods of Ethics, 4th edition
and asked her to write any passage from that work. Almost
at once she said,
"
Page 205," and commenced to write what
appears on the document numbered 1, which I enclose. The
passage is practically word for word the middle paragraph on
page 205. Very soon afterwards she wrote the few words at the
end of document 1 which, as slightly expanded, appear on page
204 of the same volume. I may say that it is
quite certain
that [Mrs. Jackson] has never read the work ;
I read it once
many years ago, after I left Trinity College, Cambridge, but
naturally I have retained only a vague knowledge of the general
principles of the subject. My pencil notes on document 1 were
made contemporaneously with the writing by [Mrs. Jackson].
My note, again contemporaneous with the writing, on the back
of document 2 explains the circumstances in which it was written.
[Mrs. Jackson]'s script on the front of the document is the begin-
ning of Chapter I. of the Vicar of Wakefield down to the bottom
of the page. The edition is one published in Leipsig in 1850
and intended for German readers. [Mrs. Jackson] had never
read the Vicar of Wakefield ;
I had read it very many years
ago, and then, so far as I know, not in that edition.
The next document, numbered 3, needs some explanation. On
Dec. 6, 1919, the Railway A. B.C. was in the Library where we
were sitting alone. I suggested to [Mrs. Jackson] by way of
variant, that she should write down something in the A. B.C.,
not suggesting or even thinking of any line of railway. She
immediately commenced to write down the trains from Waterloo
to Leatherhead, herself numbering the page as it appears in her
writing. I then checked the writing with the original print, and
found only two mistakes, which I have marked in pencil with
a
"
tick." Soon afterwards on the same evening I suggested
that she should write down the trains from London to Manchester ;
this she did, as appears also on document 3. In this I believe
there is only one slight error, a
"
d
"
or an
"
r
"
omitted ; un-
fortunately I did not mark the error at the time. I may say
that neither [Mrs. Jackson] nor I ever have occasion to refer to
182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.
the trains between Waterloo and Leatherhead or between Euston
and Manchester.
The next three documents, 4, 5, and 6, pinned together, also
require some explanation. On March llth, 1920, [Mrs. Jackson]
was in my Chambers [address given], for about 5 minutes. I
was with her all the time. She noticed the title of one of the
books on my shelves Farwell on Powers (3rd edition), and it
struck her as a curious title. The book, by the late Lord Justice
Farwell, is a standard authority on its subject. On the evening
of the same day she said,
"
I think I could do something from
Farwell on Powers," and immediately wrote the passage on
document 4, pausing long at the words "as if she were," and
then giving up for the night. I remember remarking to her
that the next words were Norman French, and that I did not
wonder that she was puzzled : from the subject of the script I
recognised it as a quotation from the Married Women's Property
Act, 1882, and I knew what the next three words must be, viz.
"
a feme sole." The next morning in the Hampstead Tube [Mrs.
Jackson] wrote the words on document 5, continuing the quota-
tion omitting the word
"
a
"
from where she had left off on
the previous evening. She had written
"
296
"
at the top of
document 4, so that it was easy to verify the citation, which I
did, and found it correct with the exception of only one or two
words. The short passage in document 6 is verbatim, I
believe,
from Williams on Bankruptcy (llth edition) at p. 241 ; again the
page was noted by [Mrs. Jackson] ;
as my contemporaneous note
shows, it was written in the Tube on March 15th, 1920. The
book was also on the shelves in my Chambers, near Farwell on
Powers. I cannot now be sure why [Mrs. Jackson] chose a
passage from Williams on Bankruptcy ;
but I am almost certain
that it was a random shot on her part, and that it was only
the subject matter of the script which gave me the clue to the
book.
Since the date on document 6 we have not attempted any of
these quasi book-tests. Having ascertained that [Mrs. Jackson]
could reproduce the printed matter in a book with which she was
entirely unfamiliar for she had never read any of the books
above mentioned the mere multiplication of experiments did not
interest us, more especially as the concentration on her part was
very severe, and involved somewhat acute headache. Moreover,
she was much more interested in the production of music, written
DEC., 1921. Case. 183
out by some form, possibly, of clairvoyance, mixed with clair-
audience a manifestation of psychic energy which the Hon.
Everard Feilding has investigated.
I will not attempt any theory to explain the phenomena of
these tests ;
this I must leave to those who have had far greater
experience in analogous phenomena. I can only suggest that they
may perhaps throw some light on the results obtained through
Mrs. Leonard. In [Mrs. JacksonJ's case, verbatim knowledge of
the contents of a book was obtained not through the intervention
of any discarnate entity, but, so far as appears, entirely through
some supernormal power which she possessed. She was not in
trance when she wrote the passages ;
she seemed to be in a
normal state, or in only the lightest hypnotic condition : it was
intense concentration, and nothing else, which, so far as we know,
produced the results.
May I add that, if our names are suppressed, we are quite
willing that you should make any use of this communication
which you may think proper ? . . .

Intuitionism. P. 205.
As an example again of thinkers who while recognising in
human nature a disinterested regard for duty or virtue as such
still consider that self love is a proper and legit (sic) motive to
right conduct we may refer to Butler and his disciples. Butler
regards reasonable self love as not merely a normal motive to
human action but as being no less than conscience a chief or
superior principle in the nature of man so that an action becomes
unsuitable to this nature if the principle of self love be violated.
Accordingly the aim of his teaching is not to induce men to
choose duty rather than interest, but to convince them that there
is not any inconsistency between the two, that self love and
conscience lead to one and the same course of life.

The Vicar of Wakefield, Chapter I.
I was ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and
brought up a large family did more service than he who con-
tinued single, and only talked of population. From this motive,
I had scarce taken orders a year before I began to think seriously
of matrimony, and chose my wife, as she did her wedding gown,
not for a fine glossy surface, but for such qualities as would wear
well. To do her justice, she was a good-natured notable woman,
& as for breeding there were few country ladies who could show
more. She could read any English book without much spelling,
but for pickling, preserving, and cookery, none could excel her.
She prided herself also upon being an excellent contriver in house-
keeping ; though I could never find that we grew richer with all
her contrivances. However, we loved each other tenderly and
our fondness increased as we grew old. There was in fact nothing
thatf could make us angry with the world or each other. We
had an elegant house situated in a fine country and a good elegant-
(sic) neighbourhood.

with me to Chambers the key of this desk. When I came home
at 7.45 p. m. the portion down to f was written. At dinner I
checked this with the original and found it correct. The few
remaining words were written in my presence after the book had

On receiving Mr. Brook's letter of May 17, 1921, and the
enclosed documents, Mrs. Sidgwick wrote a letter to Mr.
Brook in which she put the following questions :
1. Did the idea of the particular form of experiment occur first
to you or to [Mrs. Jackson] ? Do you remember what suggested
it, e.g. was it hearing of the experiments with Mrs. Leonard ?
2. Are the cases you send all that were tried, or were there
others less successful and perhaps not even recorded ?
3. The page was, I observe, always selected by [Mrs. Jackson],
except in the remarkable instance of the Euston-Manchester
trains. The volumes in the December, 1919, experiments were
selected by you. Do you remember whether your selection was
at once accepted by [Mrs. Jackson] ? Or did she ever have a
feeling that she would be unlikely to succeed with book A, but
might succeed with another book, so that it would be more
worth while to try with the second choice ? And if this ever
happened did you change your selection ?
4. Did [Mrs. Jackson] think her psychical experiences were the
cause of her break-down in health, and therefore to be avoided
in future, or did they cease involuntarily owing to the break-
down ? You merely state that
"
owing to a break-down in her
health
"
her psychic powers
"
have for some time ceased."
In reply to these questions Mr. Brook wrote to Mrs.
Sidgwick, thus : June 6, 1921.
... I will endeavour to answer your questions.
1. The particular form of experiment occurred first to me, not
to [Mrs. Jackson]. We had not heard of the experiments with
Mrs. Leonard. The book-tests seemed to arise naturally from the
DEC., 1921. Case. 187
markable development of [Mrs. JacksonJ's psychic powers in
;he summer and autumn of 1919 : this development assumed
various forms, e.g. automatic writing, rapid use of the Ouija,
iting music (with correct harmonies), which she had never
ard much of which has not yet been traced etc. By means
the Ouija she answered the question :
"
What is the name of
.he spirit [Mrs. Jackson] saw
"
on such an occasion ?
by giving
the page and volume of Chambers' Encyclopaedia, on which the
biography of Home, the medium, was set out the Ouija answer
also stating the name "
Home." At this time neither of us had
heard of Home at all ;
and the reference was quite correct. It
therefore occurred to me that she might have clairvoyant power
as to the contents of a book.
2. Every case of a book-test was successful, so far as I can
recollect. I can only remember two other cases beyond those
which I sent : these are
(a) a passage from one of Kipling's poems, but in this case
[Mrs. Jackson] had the book in her hand, open at another
page, shortly before she wrote the passage ;
and
(6) a passage from Dr. Brown's Home Subsecivae. Here, so
far as I remember, [Mrs. Jackson] wrote the name of
the book and the page, not in the least understanding
the title, and having never read the book :
you will
remember it contains that beautiful story,
"
Rab and his
Friends." The book was not in the room in which_ she
wrote, so far as I recollect ; anyhow, I remember very
distinctly having great trouble to find it in the drawing-
room, where it was tucked away in a niche in a corner
book-case.
3. In every case, except the Manchester-Euston trains, [Mrs.
ickson] named the page. My selection of a volume was always
accepted by her without demur, and she never wanted a second
choice. You will remember, however, that she chose Farwell on
Powers, and the instances given above (in my answer 2) were
cases of Tier
selecting the book.
4. [Mrs. JacksonJ's psychic experiences were not at all the
cause of her break-down in health. She is suffering from
sclerosis of the arteries, which must have been coming on for
some time ... I have not thought it wise to attempt any
psychic work, and her own unaided, or unstimulated power of
writing elaborate music seems to have left her. The only psychic
188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1921.
or telepathic experiment we tried at all lately has been
"
trans-
ference of sensations." ... I found that she at once felt a prick
in any part of the body where I pricked myself, wrist, ankle,
etc. In each case she did not know where I was pricked, as her
eyes were shut. Also, salt in my mouth produced saliva in
hers, and mustard in mine made her eyes water. The same
transference of a prick took place when she did not know that
I was going to try the experiment, and at a distance of some
yards. These we regarded as
"
psychic games," which could not
affect her health in any way. [T. BROOK.]
CORRESPONDENCE.
BLEEDING STIGMATA.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, In his interesting and fair paper on
"
The Phenomena
of Stigmatization," Father Thurston lays some stress on the
claim that bleeding stigmata have never been experimentally
produced ; feeling
"
that any successful experiment in that
direction could not have failed to attract attention and become
very widely known."
I find that two or three such cases are mentioned in Human
Personality. On p. 497, Vol. I., Myers says, giving references :
"
Haemorrhage and bleeding stigmata were several times produced
in the famous subject, Louis Vive ... by verbal suggestion
alone
"
;
on pp. 493-5 of the same volume he quotes at length
a description of the appearance, on Fridays, as a result of hypnotic
suggestion, of a cruciform stigma on a woman's chest, accompanied
on one occasion by blood ;
and on p. 498 he summarises a case
from the Revue de VHypnotisme for February 1892, saying (inter
alia) :
"
Next it was suggested that instead of the ocular haemor-
rhage the patient should bleed at the palm of the left hand ;
this occurred, the skin, however, remaining intact, and the blood
appearing to ooze through it like perspiration."
With regard to the general question of the experimental
production of stigmata, a point to be kept in mind, I think, is
that no responsible hypnotist would feel justified (at least, without
the full knowledge and consent of the patient and her friends)
in undertaking experiments with the object of producing such
extremely painful and distressing symptoms as some of those
detailed in Father Thurston's paper.
There is also recorded in Human Personality (Vol. I., pp. 456-8)
a case of a man who made a good recovery after being shot
through the heart : not an isolated case, apparently, since it
was related in a paper on
"
Gunshot Wounds of the Heart," read
before the American Surgical Association at New York. This
bears on another point discussed by Father Thurston in connection
with stigmatization. HUBERT WALES.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR PSYCHICAL
RESEARCH.
[N the Report of the First International Congress printed in the
^ournal for December, 1921, the paper mentioned below, which
been included in the Report of the Congress read by Mrs.
sr at a Private Meeting of the Society, was unfortunately
dtted.

of Materialisation obtained with the Medium " Eva
Carriere."
This paper should have been printed as the first in Class II.,
Group 2, Physical, on p. 177 of the Journal. Our apologies are
lue to Madame Bisson for this omission.
CASE.
E print below a report on some interesting results obtained
the course of experiments with a Ouija board. The results
y be divided into two groups thus :
(1) Information given concerning deceased persons and in
one case referring to the existence and place of a document ;
some of this information had never, so far as is ascertainable,
besn known to any of those present.
(2) Veridical references to the contents of closed books,
of which those concerned had, so far as they are aware,
no normal knowledge.
The group of experimenters concerned in this case include
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. C. Kimber, who have kindly allowed us
to give their names, and certain friends of theirs, whose names
are known to the Society, but who will be referred to here
under pseudonyms, namely, Mrs. Ellis, and her sister, Mrs.
A 2
192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1022.
Dixon, both of whom lost their husbands in the war. Mr.
Kimber has habitually acted as notetaker, Mrs. Kimber, Mrs.
Ellis, and Mrs. Dixon being the sitters. Of these three Mrs.
Ellis is, according to a statement made b}
7 Mr. Kimber,
"
undoubtedly the most sensitive."
Our first report of the case was received in June, 1921,
from Colonel C. E. Baddeley, C.M.G., C.B., who is personally
acquainted with the experimenters, and since that time
Mrs. Sidgwick has also made acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs.
Kimber and with Mrs. Ellis, and has had some correspondence
with them. Both Mrs. Sidgwick and Colonel Baddeley have
formed a high opinion as to the accuracy and good faith
with which the experiments have been conducted. In addition
to the results which we print below, there have been some
further interesting developments in the case on rather different
lines, and we hope it may be possible to give some report
of these later.
We will first quote an extract from a letter of Colonel
Baddeley's which gives some account of the way in which the
experiments are carried out :
Now, as to the methods :
They use a circular smooth tray with
raised edge, on the periphery of which the letters of the alphabet
are pasted. The
"
instrument
"
used is an inverted glass.
Mr. Kimber puts a pad of cotton wool over the eyes of the
operators, and a handkerchief bandage over that. He constantly
moves the tray around so that the sitters should not know where
the letters come. He simply says :
"
yes," as the glass points
to the letters, and does not read out what has come until the
end of the sentence, when the glass returns to the centre of the
tray and remains stationary. I need hardly say that all con-
cerned are intensely in earnest and take the matter very seriously.
Mrs. [Ellis] appears to be the real "medium," although her
sister appears to have some powers in a lesser degree ;
she knew
nothing about psychic matters until a few months ago when
Mrs. Kimber took her to a sitting with Miss Ortner. On enquiry
I found that Mrs. [Ellis], when a girl in India, had occasionally
sat for the Ouija board, and had had results, though at the
time it was looked upon as a
"
game
"
and not taken seriously.

also contained in a letter from Mr. Kimber to Mrs. Sidgwick,
written in July, 1921, thus :
May I say first of all that at all our sittings we have had test
conditions so far as we can make them, i.e. careful blindfolding
of sitters (except myself as note-taker), nothing read out until the
end of sentence, and the board repeatedly moved round about to
alter the position of the letters.
L. 1234. I. VERIDICAL INFORMATION CONCERNING Two MEN
KILLED IN THE WAR.
(a) THE KUT PRISONER CASE.
In the quotations given below from the records of the
sittings, the letters spelt out on the board appear in capitals,
remarks or questions by any of those present are in round
brackets.
Extract from the Record of Sitting on February 27, 1921.

(Recognizing this as a stranger by the different movement of
the glass, I [Mr. Kimber] asked :
"

ONLY JUST KUT PRISONER.
(Have any of us seen you before ?)
NO.
Note. Thinking this was not for us, as no one present knew of
a Kut prisoner, we broke off. We discovered later by judicious
enquiry that our cook
"
Florence
"
had a
"
young man "
who was
a prisoner at Kut and died there. His name was Alf Goff. The
cook was in the house at the time of the sitting.
Mrs. [Dixon] and Mrs. [Ellis] had absolutely no knowledge of
Florence or her affairs.
Mr. and Mrs. Kimber knew that Florence had a young man
"
who was killed in the war." This is the only information that
was, or ever had been in the minds of those present at the
sitting.

Note. The whole message was written before I read out. On
enquiry we found that Alf Goff had a brother Harry and they
both lived at Richmond, which was quite unknown to any one
present at the sitting. We had been most careful not to enquire
details in case he came again. The cook Florence was in the
kitchen at the time of sitting.
In reply to a letter from Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Kimber made
a further statement concerning the above record, thus :
August 7, 1921.
In the Alf Goff case you are right of course in supposing all
the information given was known to the cook. . . . The letters
PFBO I put in just as they came, and occasionally we get some
of these uncontrolled letters, very often at the beginning of a
sentence and if I ask what they mean we are told
"
Bob "
[one
of the principal communicators, see below] was not ready quite.
It looks as if it requires great concentration on their side to get
direction and that failing this, one gets movement only. Also
I think that the communicators
"
sense
"
the sound that the
letters represent rather than actually see them in black and
white, as this would account for the phonetic spelling which often
comes through.
(b) THE STAFF COLLEGE REPORT CASE.
The man whose Christian name, Bob, appears in the extract
from the sitting quoted below is Colonel Ellis, Mrs. Ellis's
husband, killed in the war. He is one of the principal com-
municators in the sittings now under consideration.

Note. This private box of Colonel Ellis's had been sent on to
Mrs. Ellis from his parents' home in Herefordshire. Mrs. Ellis
was unable to open it, as the key was missing. About a week
before this sitting Mrs. Ellis had a key made, and on looking into
the box found it full of packets of her letters to Colonel Ellis.
Not knowing what to do with them, Mrs. Ellis locked the box
without examining its contents.
Mrs. Ellis, on her return home after this sitting, went through
the box twice without finding the Report. On going through the
contents of the box a third time two days later, Mrs. Ellis found,
folded in with other papers at the bottom of the box, Colonel
Ellis's Staff College Report.
Mrs. Ellis had never seen this Report before, and in fact did
not know of its having been in Colonel Ellis's possession. Having
made careful enquiry as far as possible, we are not aware of the
above fact of the Report being in the position indicated being in
any living mind.
M. Cl. 107. II. VERIDICAL REFERENCES TO THE CONTENTS
OF CLOSED BOOKS.
At about the same time as the case of the Kut prisoner
there began to be some attempts at book-tests in the sittings
with the Ouija board. The first three, which occurred on
February 23rd, April 20th, May 2nd, 1921, respectively, although
in each case they present features of interest, are not so
striking as the later attempts, and are not quoted here.
On May 30th, 1921, Mr. and Mrs. Kimber were paying their
first visit at the house of the parents of Mrs. Ellis and Mrs.

Note. On the top shelf of the bookcase in the passage second
from the left next a Bible was
"

Captain F. S. Brereton. The book was bound in red.
Page 40, line 7 and onwards reads :
"
Leaving the airy dining room the two stepped on to the
broad paved verandah which entirely surrounded the bungalow
and took their seats in a shady nook."
The chapter before this is headed at the top of each page
"
Off to Aden."
Colonel and Mrs. Ellis were at Aden for nine months ;
their
bungalow was as described. No one present had ever read this
book, in fact the book had been brought three days before from
a pile of old ones belonging to some one not living in the house
and put in the case, to fill a gap, by the mother of Mrs. Ellis
and Mrs. Dixon.
Additional Note by Colonel Baddeley. Mrs. [Ellis] told me the
verandah of their bungalow at Aden could be reached by a door
leading directly out of the dining room a close parallel to the
description in the book. This is very usual in Aden bungalows.
They used to sit together in a special place in the verandah.
The circumstances in which this test was given are con-
firmed in a letter from Mr. Kimber to Mrs. Sidgwick, written
in July, 1921. (Part of this letter, referring to another matter,
was quoted above.)

Mrs. Ellis read the book years ago, but did not know of its
position by the bedside. Mr. and Mrs. Kimber and Colonel
Baddeley do not remember ever having read the book.
It will be seen that the particular passage indicated in the
book fulfils the requirements of the test in two particulars ;
(1) there is a reference to India, (2) the passage is in the
form of a question, as indicated in the first words quoted
above from the record of the sitting : "A question test."
The book-test with which we will conclude this report was
of a rather different type. It was not obtained through the
Ouija board, but by a direct impression which came to Mr.
Kimber. Before giving his account of his experience it is
necessary to explain that there has recently been a new
development in the phenomena observed by Mr. and Mrs.
Kimber. A friend of theirs, now dead, who is referred to
below as C.D., has apparently been trying to convey messages
by making audible raps on a jug. There have been some
incidents of considerable interest in this connexion, but they
are not included in the present report.

Statement by Mr. Kimber.
September Qth-lOth, 1921.
Between sleeping and waking on the above date, hearing C.D.
tap on the jug, I spoke to him, and a few seconds later into
my head came the thought of the bookcase in the dining room.
Then I got the impression top shelf, 14 from left, page 8 line 2.
Thinking I was making this up, I took no heed, but 14-8-2 kept
ringing in my head, so I said :
"
What's on that line, please ?
"
"Cold or snow," came into my brain immediately. "What colour
is the book ?
"
I asked.
"
Red," came at once.
Next day I forgot all about this until dinner time, when it
came again 14-8-2. I wrote down the particulars on an envelope
and handed this to Mrs. Kimber.
On looking we found the fourteenth book from the left, top
shelf, was
"
Field and Hedgerow
"
by Richard Jeffries, and was
bound in red. The line indicated, taking the last four words of
line one, reads :
"
Ice raining in small shot of frost, howling, sleeting, groaning."
The sentence before tfyis reads :
"
Snow in broad flakes, snow in semi-flakes, snow raining down
in frozen specks," the word snow occurring three times.
I have read the book, but certainly not for ten or twelve years,
probably more.
The books in the bookcase had been dusted and re-arranged
by the housemaid on September 2nd. Between that date and the
10th I had been to the bookcase once to fetch a book from the
bottom shelf, the position of which I knew more or less owing to
its size, so had not to search for it.
In reply to a letter from Mrs. Sidgwick asking whether the
paper on which Mr. Kimber had written down his impression
had been kept, Mrs. Kimber wrote thus :
November 28th, [1921].
As regards my husband's
"
dream book-test
"
he has made a
thorough search for the envelope that he wrote the book, line,
page, etc., down on, but is afraid he tore it up, when he was
tidying his papers. I am, however, witness to the fact that he
did write it down at the dinner table and handed it to me before
he got up to look for the book.

The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case.
THE HOPFGARTEN POLTERGEIST CASE.1
'he report which we print below is an abstract of the paper read
in German by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing at the First Inter-
national Congress for Psychical Research.]
the village of Hopfgarten, near Weimar, there lived a
ock-maker, Ernst Sauerbrey by name, and his second wife,
Minna. By his first wife he had a son, Otto Sauerbrey, now
21 years old, and also a clock-maker (in Arnstadt). Since the
summer of 1919 the young man had been giving public exhi-
bitions in hypnotism, spiritism and such things.
Otto Sauerbrey came to his father's house at Hopfgarten on
February 10th, 1921, remaining two days, and during that
period he gave an exhibition, and he also hypnotised his
stepmother. Afterwards, when legal proceedings were taken
against him by the public authorities, he denied this. But
there are two witnesses to the fact that he attempted
something in the nature of hypnotic suggestion, and their
evidence on this point seems quite clear. On February 12th
Otto Sauerbrey went away.
Frau Sauerbrey was suffering from an incurable internal com-
plaint of long standing. She had been bedridden for more
than a year, and was in a condition of extreme physical and
nervous debility. She was at that time using as her bed a
sofa in the kitchen, and according to the testimony of various
witnesses, including the doctor attending her, she was far too
weak to get up, and could hardly even raise her hand.
On the evening of the second day after Otto Sauerbrey's
eparture, according to the evidence of his father, Ernst Sauer-
brey, and of his stepsister, Frieda Pappe, who lived in the
house, a sound of loud knocking was heard in the kitchen,
which continued on and off during the whole night. In
consequence of the legal proceedings taken against Otto
Sauerbrey some two months later, the evidence of these
two witnesses and of other witnesses also was taken upon
oath, and some extracts from their depositions will presently

given because the case is of the type that we usually classify under that
200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1022.
be quoted. Suffice it at the moment to say that these
sounds, which are described as resembling blows with the fist
upon the walls and doors of the room, and upon various
articles of furniture, were repeated night after night from the
13th to the 28th of February. There is also some evidence
for the movement of objects, such as a jug and water basin,
apparently without any normal cause.
During this period Frau Sauerbrey's physical and mental
condition grew noticeably worse. She muttered to herself, her
mind wandered, and she appeared to be constantly obsessed
by the idea of her stepson's presence and influence over her.
In particular, there was a marked change for the worse on the
17th of February, and it was observed that on that day at
about 11 p.m. the knocking was unusually loud. She spoke
to her daughter Frieda Pappe of her fear of her stepson ;
she
said that she saw his eyes before her during the night, and
refused to be argued out of this belief.
On the 27th of February the police from Weimar were
called in ; they heard the rapping, and one of them witnessed
the movement of an object apparently without any contact.
On the 28th of February the police called in a nerve-
specialist, Dr. Kahle, and he succeeded by counter-suggestion
in freeing Frau Sauerbrey from her obsession about her stepson.
She called out : "I am now free." From that moment the
phenomena ceased, and they never occurred again.
On the 27th of March, 1921, Frau Sauerbrey died of the
internal complaint from which she was suffering.
There is no doubt at all in this case that the phenomena
centred entirely about Frau Sauerbrey, and were in some cases
the result of the curious mental condition into which she fell
as a result of Otto Sauerbrey's attempt to hypnotise her.
The interest of the case from a psychical standpoint turns, in
the first instance, upon the question whether it is possible to
establish beyond doubt that Frau Sauerbrey could not have
caused the phenomena by normal means. Upon this point the
three principal witnesses were all in complete agreement, and
their evidence was considered conclusive by the magistrate
before whom the case against Otto Sauerbrey was tried.
AX., 11)22. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 201
EVIDENCE OF WITNESSES ON OATH.
1. Dr. Scharff.
The evidence of Dr. Scharff, who attended Frau Sauerbrey
uring the period concerned, is confined to the question of her
.ental and physical condition. Dr. Scharff testifies that in his
pinion Frau Sauerbrey was physically incapable of producing the
effects observed owing to her extreme weakness.
2. Ernst Sauerbrey.
My wife lay in the kitchen. Since October, 1919, she had been
continuously in bed, except that once, on New Year's Day, 1920,
she left her bed for half an hour. But in consequence of her
bodily weakness she had to lie down again.
On the second day after my son's departure, about February 12,
I heard in the night a sound of knocking on the table and on
the walls. I slept in the room next the kitchen. My wife drew
my attention to the knocking and said I should see who it was
that knocked. I went into the kitchen, and having observed that
the knocking came from there, I made a thorough search, but
found nothing. As soon as the light was lit, the knocking stopped.
I went to bed again. Shortly afterwards the knocking was again
heard. It was very loud. My wife lay on a sofa in the kitchen,
and remained quite quiet. As the knocking went on all night,
I woke my step-daughter, Frieda Pappe, and she remained awake
through the rest of the night. These psychic manifestations began
again on the second night. The knocking was heard from six
o'clock in the evening to seven o'clock in the morning. On one
of the next nights a few objects moved. A coffee-cup, which stood
upon a chair in the kitchen, fell from the chair which was moving
away from under it, and was broken to pieces. In the same way
a table moved, and a jug and water basin. It is quite impossible
that my wife should have brought these things about herself.
Because we could no longer get any sleep at night, my step-
daughter went to Weimar and informed the police of what had
occurred. Next night eight of the police came from Weimar, and
surrounded the house. Some of the police came into the house,
and these witnessed the psychic manifestations, which occurred on
that night also. In the presence of Commissioner of Police Pfeil,
from Weimar, some objects were set out in the middle of the
202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1922.
room at a distance of two metres from my wife's bed. It was
observed that these objects also moved from the place where
they were standing, without any one coming into contact with
them. A sound of knocking was also heard. The next night the
police came again, accompanied by Dr. Kahle. That night the
sound of knocking was again audible. On the night after that
we heard nothing more.
3. Frieda Pappe.
My mother spoke much to me of the accused. She told me
that she was afraid of him and that when night came on she
saw his eyes ;
it always seemed to her as though the accused
were in the kitchen. I argued this with her, and tried to talk
her out of it. On the second day after the accused went away
for the last time, about February 13, we heard a sound of knock-
ing on the kitchen door. On the second night we heard it also
on the table and the chair in the kitchen, where my mother was
lying. My mother was not responsible for these noises. As soon
as a light was lit, the noises became less loud.
It is quite impossible that my mother should have moved the
articles or made the knocking herself, because in the presence of
the police we made experiments, and moved the objects so far
from my mother's sofa that she could not reach them ;
and yet
they moved from their places. I noticed that the objects, chair,
jug, water-basin and so forth, moved away from my mother.
When there was knocking and my mother answered, the noise
ceased. The knocking could be heard all night long. A chair
and a jug which stood next to each other knocked loudly together.
4. Walter DegenMbe, Tailor.
During the time now in question I went to Hopfgarten nearly
every Sunday. (He then gives an account of how he saw the
accused stroke Frau Sauerbrey over the forehead and say a few
words to her.) On the second night, after I arrived, I heard
a sound of knocking on the furniture and on the walls. It is
quite impossible that Frau Sauerbrey should have made these
noises. She lay quiet, and I must have seen if she had moved.
I also saw a chair and a table move from their places, and I saw
a cup fall off a chair and break to pieces.
On Monday evening the police came. Frau Sauerbrey was
hardly aware of the manifestations. She merely said :
"
Some
FAN., 1922. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 203
one's knocking." She also told us how she always saw the
accused in her dreams.
5. Dr. Kahle.
His testimony need not be given here at any length. He gave
evidence on behalf of the accused, and was mainly concerned
with the question of how far Otto Sauerbrey could be held
responsible for the harm which his treatment appeared to have
done to his stepmother. As regards the physical phenomena
Dr. Kahle only heard a few raps, which in the circumstances in
which he heard them might easily have been caused by the sick
woman. He concluded that she had caused them, and drew
attention to the fact that in an abnormal psychical condition a
person may become capable of performing physical feats of which
they are not normally capable. As regards the greater part of
the physical manifestations, however, Dr. Kahle was not an eye-
witness.
Those are the statements of the witnesses at the trial, made
upon oath. Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing also obtained a state-
ment from the magistrate who tried the case, which includes
some rather important evidence given to him by the police.
STATEMENT BY THE MAGISTRATE, Justizrat Thierbach.
According to the statements made to me by Frau Sauerbrey's
husband and her daughter, Frieda, who were with her during
the whole period in question statements made in a quite unpre-
judiced manner it is quite impossible that Frau Sauerbrey should
have brought about the noises and movements herself. She lay
upon the sofa in such a condition of weakness that she was no
longer capable of lifting her hand.
Especially noteworthy are the following points :
A jug with water in it was set by a police-officer at the kitchen
door, and moved from there towards Frau Sauerbrey.
1
The table
shook to such an extent that a person had to grip the table-leg
between his knees in order to make writing possible. When the
husband was in the next room, there was a sound upon the door
as though some one had struck it with his fist.
1
It will be observed that according to the testimony of Frieda Pappe
objects more frequently moved aicay from Frau Sauerbrey.
204 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. JAN., 1022.
Generally speaking the movements were more marked in pro-
portion to their nearness to Frau Sauerbrey.
The statements made by Frau Sauerbrey's family were con-
firmed to me by other reliable eye-witnesses.
FURTHER STATEMENT MADE IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS PUT BY
DR. VON SCHRENCK-NOTZING.
(1) What was the lighting ?
An electric lamp over the table.
(2) Were there any manifestations by daylight ?
No, only by artificial light. The earliest time at which the
manifestations began was 5 p.m. The nearer it got to evening,
the more restless Frau Sauerbrey became.
(3) What was the nature of the knocking heard ?
As though made by striking with the knuckles or with the
fist. The knocking moved constantly about, as could be judged
by the sound. Often knocking was heard in two different places ;
there were also knocking and movements of objects simultaneously.
Frieda Pappe made the following statement : "I looked to see
whether my mother's knuckles were injured, but found nothing."
(4) Detailed statement by Commissioner of Police Pfeil.
A police-officer set a jug of water two metres away from Frau
Sauerbrey. At the very moment that he turned away, the jug
was already in motion. The same thing happened with a water
basin. A dog, which at other times was unusually bold, when
the manifestations began became unusually timid. The clock
stopped, although according to the statement of Sauerbrey, who
is a clock-maker, there was nothing wrong with it. Sometimes a
noise was heard as though some one were stroking the furniture
with the flat of his hand.
These observations were made by some ten or twelve police
whom Pfeil had sent out. They saw everything either through
the open kitchen door, or through the key-hole.
EXTRACT FROM DR. VON SCHRENCK-NOTZING's CONCLUSION.
The occurrences which were observed in the case of the Hopf-
garten poltergeist are consistently simple, and include, so far as
any evidence before us is concerned, only sounds of knocking and
?., 1922. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 205
ie movements of objects without contact, that is to say, that
of mediumistic phenomena which are called telekinetic.
(Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing goes on to point out that there
be no question here of hallucination ;
the sounds which were
leard were clearly objective, as indicated by the fact that they
were heard by every one who went to the house. After discussing
the difficulty of supposing that Frau Sauerbrey in her weak
condition could produce the phenomena by normal means, and
laying particular stress on the incident when the water-jug moved
in the police-constable's presence, he goes on :)
Of the many witnesses of these phenomena only the two mem-
bers of the family and the tailor Degenkolbe, who was frequently
in the Sauerbrey house, were called upon to make statements
upon oath. But amongst other witnesses we may especially
make mention here of the police-officers, to say nothing of
neighbours and inhabitants of the village, whom curiosity brought
into the haunted house. Not a single eye or ear-witness was
ever able to detect in the sick woman the agent of a deliberately
fraudulent
"
spirit
"
manifestation. . . .
The peculiarity of the Hopfgarten case in comparison with other
similar occurrences lies in the close connection between the pheno-
mena and the hypnoidal state of Frau Sauerbrey. It is clear
that on February llth, when she was hypnotised by her stepson
for it is evident from the statement of witnesses that he did
attempt to hypnotise her Frau Sauerbrey was not sufficiently
freed from his suggestion. She remained for 17 days in a light
dream or twilight condition, or rather, she constantly fell into it
again, until Dr. Kahle freed her from it by a counter-suggestion on
February 28th. Her whole condition, so far as it can be portrayed
to us by the observations of laymen, points to this conclusion.
She converses with her absent stepson, she sees his eyes turned
upon her as though he were present . . . she calls out, she is
restless, she shows fear of the hypnotiser, she thinks in her
delirium that the imaginary tempter is trying to compel her to
steal her neighbour's hens [this refers to an incident not quoted
in this abstract]. During this time she is to a considerable
extent sleepless, she becomes restless, and gives signs of suffering
pain, when the physical manifestations begin. Her whole manner
of behaviour reminds one of the trance condition of physical
mediums (such as Eusapia Palladino and Eva C.) which similarly
206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JAN., 1922.
accompanies the inception of the phenomena, as a result of a
strong psychomotor reaction. . . .
It would therefore seem that the psychical manifestations in
the case before us are to be interpreted as physical phenomena
of a mediumistic type, occurring spontaneously and closely con-
nected with a definite change in the state of consciousness of the
person concerned. It will now be rightly asked :
Had the manifestations of the Hopfgarten poltergeist any in-
telligent cause or not ?
On this point the material before us leads unfortunately to no
conclusion. We fincl nothing in the shape of the personification
of a transcendental agent, as nearly always takes place with
mediums. The case did not acquire any religious or spiritistic
colouring, presumably because those who took part in these
occurrences never thought of such a thing. If some intelligent
observer had been present, the possibility might have arisen of
systematising the phenomena and guiding them according to the
observer's wish, a suggestion which is supported by Police-Com-
missioner Pfeil's experiment with the water-jug.
But, on the other hand, just that lack of any religious or super-
stitious meaning in the case before us is particularly interesting
and characteristic. For it points to an unregulated exteriorisation
of vital forces in a person suffering from severe illness, which
forces, as a result of a peculiar and temporary psychic condition,
broke bounds in unruly fashion.
EDITORIAL NOTE.
The above case appears to be of special interest not only
for the reasons mentioned by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing in
his conclusions, but also because the supernormal character of
the physical manifestations is more clearly established than is
common with this type of spontaneous phenomena. It often
happens that such cases are observed under very difficult
conditions. There may be several people whose possible com-
plicity in producing them has to be taken into account, and
the phenomena may occur in a number of different places, so
that the observer does not know where to watch.
In the case now in question the issue was extremely simple.
The manifestations centred entirely about Frau Sauerbrey ;
JAN., i(
J22. The Hopfgarten Poltergeist Case. 207
there is not the slightest reason for supposing that any other
jrson was in any way concerned in producing them, and they
only in the one room in which Frau Sauerbrey lay.
[t is also to be observed that although the phenomena did not
jur by daylight, they did occur by artificial light, and not
ly in the dark. Under these circumstances it seems to be
[tremely improbable that a considerable number of witnesses,
>me of whom had very good opportunities for observation

NOTE.
A VERIDICAL IMPRESSION RECEIVED DURING A FATAL
ILLNESS.
IN the recently published Memoir of the Eight Hon. Sir E.
Fry by his daughter (Oxford University Press, 1921), there
appears upon page 17 an account of a veridical impression
concerning a distant event received by a child during her
last illness. The date of the occurrence makes it impossible
to obtain any corroborative evidence, but it seems worth while
to quote the passage here for reference.
(Sir E. Fry's mother in addition to her own large family took
charge of four children from Trinidad.)
In connexion with these children a curious case of second sight
occurred. One of the little girls was so ailing in England that
it was decided to send her home to Trinidad. After her departure
the other sister became seriously ill, and in spite of all Mrs. Fry's
tender care died.
When very ill the child said that she had seen her sister
lying in a white box, and with a little white thing on her chest.
This was reported to the parents, from whom it was afterwards
learned that the other daughter had died after her arrival at
home, and, as a post-mortem examination had taken place, a
piece of white plaster had been placed over the wound.

E. Fry, re Psychical Occurrences.)

Rt. Hon. G. W. Balfour, Mr. C. J. P. Cave, Mr. F. C. Con-
stable, Miss S. M. Kingsford, and Mr. Sydney C. Scott).
The Report of the Council for 1921 was read. 1
THE HON. TREASURER (Mr. W. H. Salter), in presenting the
Financial Statement for the year, said that the Society started
the year with a balance in hand of 255 14s. Od., and
ended it with a balance of 57 19s. 5d., but this included a
loan of 100 which it had been necessary to borrow from the
Endowment Fund. ... He had recently had the opportunity
of speaking to one of the principals of our firm of publishers
and discussing the cost of printing, which, it appeared, had
reached in April last a figure that it had never reached before ;
but since then there had been a steady decline which it was
thought would be progressive. Provided our Members would
do all that they could to help the financial resources of the
Society, the outlook for the coming year was, he thought,
brighter. But unless the Society's funds could be increased,
its usefulness as a research society would be severely ham-
pered. The Council had appointed a paid research officer, and
this would involve not only his salary, but the incidental
expenses of travelling, etc., and there would necessarily be the
reports which he would furnish for publication, thereby in-
creasing our printers' bill ;
but he believed that this would
bring an increased membership to the Society.
THE CHAIRMAN, rising to move the adoption of the Report
and the Financial Statement, said that he thought that the
Society was to be congratulated on having found a young
man a man with some youth still before him as a research

officer. Mr. Gardner Murphy also seemed to be an important
asset to the Society. He might not be known to many of our
[embers, being an American, but he was specially learned in
ic subject and very keen to go on with the work. The
lifficulty that the Treasurer mentioned about the expenses of
iblication was one that all scientific societies had suffered
mi since the War.
He moved that the Keport and Financial Statement be
lopted. The resolution, which was supported by Mr. Pidding-
ton and Miss Radclyffe-Hall, was carried unanimously.
The Chairman announced that five of the retiring Members
of the Council offered themselves for re-election, and that to
fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Dr. C. Lloyd
Tuckey, the Et. Hon. G. W. Balfour proposed, and Mr. J. G.
Piddington seconded, Mr. W. H. Salter, Hon. Treasurer of the
Society, who was a co-opted Member of the Council. No other
nominations having been received, the following were declared
to be duly elected Members of the Council : Mr. W. W.
Baggally, Eev. M. A. Bayfield, Dr. T. W. Mitchell, Mr. W. H.
Salter, Mr. Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.
The Minutes of the last Extraordinary General Meeting held
on November llth, 1921, were presented to the Chairman, and
he read brief extracts and referred to the full report which
had been printed in the Journal for December, 1921.
CONVERSAZIONE.
A CONVERSAZIONE was held for Members and Associates and
friends in the Council Chamber at 20 Hanover Square, London,
W., on Tuesday, January 31st, 1922, at 4.30 p.m., when a
representative collection of automatic drawings and paintings
were on view. Some of these, by Mrs. Watts, are in the
possession of the Society ;
for the loan of others we have to
thank the artists, Miss Bligh Bond, Mrs. Diver, and Mr. C. W.
Horsfall. There were also on view some reproductions of
automatic paintings by Signor Nunes-Vais, which he has kindly
presented to the Society. Mrs. Diver also has presented to the
Society one of the paintings shown at the Conversazione, and
we take this opportunity of thanking her.
214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
Mr. Bligh Bond gave an interesting account of the beginning
and development of his daughter's power, and the way in
which her pictures were produced ;
and Dr. Woolley gave
some interesting details in regard to the work of Mrs. Diver,
Mr. Horsfall, and Signor Nunes-Vais.
CASE.
M. Cl. 108.
WE print below a case in which a veridical impression con-
cerning an event occurring at a distance was received, either
elairvoyantly or, perhaps, telepathically, by a subject in hyp-
nosis. Our first report of the incident was contained in the
following letter from Captain F. McDermott, I. A., to Mrs. Salter :
July 18, 1921.
I am sending the following case of apparent clairvoyance for
the consideration of the Society :
While at St. Ives, Cornwall, I recently did a series of hypnotic
experiments with a friend, Mr. M. C. Naylor. In several of them
he claimed to be able to see at a distance, but as in each case
the place was verbally suggested by me I placed no importance
on what he said and attributed it merely to auto-suggestion.
I determined, however, to try a test case, and accordingly
asked him (while under hypnosis) to tell me what was going on
in my own home [in Essex]. He replied that he was in the
drawing-room (with which he is familiar) and that an old lady
with iron grey hair, dressed in black, was sitting in a chair with
her back to the window. On being questioned he replied that
he did not know the lady, but that she was wearing a hat and
her face appeared to be darkened by something like a veil,
although it might only be shadow, as the light was not on, and
the daylight was fading. He said that she was speaking to my
mother and that the conversation was as follows :
Visitor. And where is Frank ?
My Mother. Away in Cornwall for a holiday.
Visitor. Where ? At St. Mawes ? [I was at St. Mawes a
short time ago.]
My Mother. No, not this time. He is at St. Ives with a
friend.
-KB., 1922. Case. 215
During the conversation my uncle (my mother's brother) came
and spoke to both. Shortly after this my mother left the
m, leaving my uncle and the old lady together.
This experiment was performed at 9.30 p.m. on Monday, the
)th June, 1921. On Tuesday I wrote to my mother (letter
iclosed). I must explain that previous to this I have several
les tried the well-known experiment of projecting my
"
double
"
or
"
astral
"
into my mother's room, but never with evidential
success. On receiving my letter, therefore, she imagined I was
referring to a similar experiment, and replied that nothing had
occurred.
On returning home, however, I learned that not only had a
lady answering the description called on that evening, but that
every one of the other details given me was absolutely correct,
including the main points of the conversation, although in view
of the time that had elapsed my mother will not guarantee
that the extract given is verbatim. The old lady, who is not a
regular visitor, was wearing a veil.
The events mentioned occurred at about 7.45 p.m., whereas
our experiment, as previously stated, took place at 9.30 p.m.
This does not to my mind detract from the interest of the case,
as I have observed that many so-called veridical cases bear a
discrepancy as regards time.
I may add that Mr. Naylor has on occasions, while under
hypnosis, described rooms with which I am familiar and he is
not, with a fair amount of accuracy, but usually with some
wrong details.
Amnesia is never present with him after hypnosis, and I am
therefore asking him and my mother to attest the above as far
as each is concerned.
He has recently been elected a Member of the Society, and
although I myself am shortly returning to India, I hope a friend
may be able to continue the experiments, in which case further
matter of interest may be obtained.
F. McDERMOTT, Capt. LA.
I hereby certify that all the details in the above are correct
so far as they concern myself.
A. McDERMOTT.
M. C. NAYLOR.
216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
Enclosed with the above was Captain McDermott's letter
to Mrs. McDermott (to. which he refers). It ran thus :
PORTHMINSTER HOTEL,
ST. IVES, CORNWALL,
21 st June, 1921.
MY DEAR MOTHER,
. . .
By the way did you have anybody visit you last
night (Monday) ? Think it out carefully before you reply, as
it concerns an experiment Mark and myself did. Don't leave
anybody out even F ! Let me have a reply as soon as
you can . . . FRANK.
(Note. I purposely made this letter indefinite, as I did not
wish to mention details which my mother might
"
read back/'
I was also careful in this respect when questioning her.
F. McDERMOTT.)
In reply to these communications Mrs. Salter wrote to
Captain McDermott asking for additional information on one
or two points, and for an independent statement from Mrs.
McDermott, and from Captain McDermott's uncle, Mr. Peel.
Mrs. Salter pointed out in her letter that as regards the
hypothesis that Mr. Naylor had derived his impression clair-
voyantly, the following point must be considered. It was not
at all unusual for impressions of a telepathic nature to be
deferred, the generally accepted hypothesis being that such
impressions had remained latent in the percipient's mind and
emerged when for some reason or another the percipient's
mental condition favoured the emergence of sub-conscious
ideas. In the case of clairvoyance it was usually supposed
that the percipient became supernormally aware of some
external event actually occurring at the time of the clair-
voyance. In the case now in question the event of which
Mr. Naylor became aware had occurred before the beginning
of the experiment, and if, therefore, it was supposed that
he had become aware of it clairvoyantly, it would seem to
follow that he had exercised this faculty in his normal state,
the only effect of the hypnosis being to bring the submerged
impression to the surface.
FEB., 1922. Case. 217
In reply to Mrs. Salter's letter Captain McDermott wrote
as follows :
July 26, 1921.
... As requested I am enclosing an independent account from
my mother and uncle.
The point which seems to be doubtful is when the conversation
took place (see below). However, I cannot help thinking that
in any case little evidential value can be placed on the conversa-
tion, as the subject was a very likely one for discussion between
any visitor and my mother, and Mr. Naylor, of course, knew
that I had visited St. Mawes. He also knew that my uncle
was in the house. Two of the details could, therefore, be ex-
plained by chance, but the remainder is absolutely outside his
knowledge, and it is an interesting point to note that he had
never seen or discussed with me any visitor to my house even
vaguely resembling the description given.
As regards a theory to account for the case, I agree that the
discrepancy in time is against clairvoyance as an explanation.
However, there also seem to be difficulties in the way of putting
it down to latent telepathy. I am of course familiar with the
well-known cases where information has apparently lain dormant
in a percipient's mind, and afterwards been conveyed to him by
hallucination, or otherwise. But this case differs therefrom in
that the information obtained was consciously selected and asked
for by me, without being consciously in my mind.
The only theory which prima facie appears to cover it is the
bewildering one of cosmic consciousness. . . .
F. McDEEMOTT, Capt. I. A.
Enclosed with Captain McDermott's letter were the following
confirmatory statements from Mrs. McDermott and Mr. Peel
in the form of a letter to Mrs. Salter :
July 27, 1921.
My son has shown me your letter requesting details concerning
the visit of an old lady on Monday, the 20th June, 1921.
The lady in question came here early in the afternoon, had
tea with me, and left about 8 p.m. or shortly before. I cannot
of course remember exactly what conversation took place between
us, but I do remember her asking after my son, on which I
218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
replied that he was in Cornwall. Whereupon she said :
"
Ohr
at St. Mawes," (a place he had previously visited several times),
and I replied :
"
No, at St. Ives this time
"
or words to that
effect. I do not, however, think this took place just before
my brother came into the room. It was probably some consider-
able time before. At about 7.45 p.m., shortly before the visitor
left, she was sitting dressed in black and wearing a hat and
veil in a seat with her back to the window.
My brother came into the room and I immediately left. I
distinctly remember this, because I had been worrying about my
mother who is an invalid, and was wondering if she required
anything, but did not wish to leave the visitor alone. I therefore
took the opportunity afforded by the entrance of my brother
of leaving somebody else to carry on the conversation.
This particular old lady had not visited me for several months
previous to the day mentioned.
There is one other lady who visits here and who answers the
description, but I am not sure whether she usually wears a
veil. She too has not been here for many months now.
A. McDERMOTT.
With reference to the foregoing I beg to certify that about
the time mentioned I entered the drawing-room in which my sister
was talking to a Mrs. H ,
an old lady wearing black with
hat and veil on, and sitting with her back to the window. On
my entering my sister left the room. I did not hear the con-
versation referred to. THOS. E. PEEL.
With regard to the question of how Mr. Naylor obtained
his information, it is possible to suppose if we take the
telepathic hypothesis that Captain McDermott obtained the
knowledge himself telepathically and transmitted it, again
telepathically, to Mr. Naylor at the time of the experiment. If
that were so, the fact that this piece of information was lying
dormant in Captain McDermott's mind might account for the
particular question he put to Mr. Naylor. But our knowledge
as to how such incidents occur is at present so imperfect
that there is little use in theorising. It is with a view to
increasing our knowledge that it is important to put on record
SB., 1922.

many instances as possible in which information appears
have been supernormally acquired.
It is to be noted that Mr. Naylor's allusion to the failing
ight made with reference to the shadow on the old lady's
-appears to be based on the circumstances obtaining
the time of the experiment, 9.30 p.m. summer time (8.30
.m. Greenwich time) rather than on the circumstances obtain-
ig at the time when the actual event in question occurred.
Lccording to Mrs. McDermott's statement the visitor left her
house at 8 p.m. summer time, or a little before. At 7 p.m.
(Greenwich time) on the 20th of June the sun is still well
above the horizon and it is still broad daylight, especially
in such a cloudless summer as we had last year ;
there would
certainly be no question of having the light on, as Mr. Naylor
appears to suggest.
AN EXPERIMENT IN FAKING "
SPIRIT "
PHOTOGRAPHS.
BY THE HON. EVERARD FEILDING.
MR. JAMES DOUGLAS, of the Sunday Express, having recently
had a sitting with Mr. Hope, the
'
spirit photographer
'
of
Crewe, at which an extra was successfully introduced, issued
an invitation to any expert in photography to attempt to
do the same under similar conditions by a normal process.
This invitation was accepted by Mr. William Marriott, and
the experiment was duly carried out at the College of Psychic
Science on December 5. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Mr.
J. Hewat M'Kenzie, Principal of the College, were, with
Mr. Marriott's concurrence, invited to attend by Mr. Douglas,
and Mr. Dean, Art Editor of Pearson's Magazine, and myself,
with Mr. Douglas' concurrence, by Mr. Marriott. The object
of the experiment was not to create test conditions for Mr.
Marriott, but to test the value of his expressed opinion that
the conditions described by Mr. Douglas in the Sunday Express
of November 6 as having prevailed at his sitting with Mr.
Hope were not sufficiently strict to prevent trickery, and that
working under precisely the same conditions, he would be able
220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
to imitate Mr. Hope's results. At a preliminary conversation
it was, at Mr. Douglas' request, agreed that he should be
regarded as the sole referee, and his decision on any points
of dispute that might arise be accepted as final. It was also
agreed that if
any of the observers noticed any departure from
the prescribed conditions they should at once say so, but this,
I understood, was to be the limit of our functions. As the
proceedings have been fully described in the issue of the
Sunday Express of December 11, 1921, I need not give a
detailed account of them, and limit myself to saying that the
camera (Mr. Marriott's, but of the same type as that used by
Mr. Hope) and the slide were examined in all their parts by
the committee, that Mr. Douglas brought his own plates, and
that a stenographer was present to whom was dictated at the
time all that occurred. According to these notes the packet
remained in full view until the moment when Mr. Douglas, after
allowing Mr. Marriott to slit it open while he held it, dis-
appeared with it into the dark room with Mr. Marriott. Mr.
Douglas then dictated from inside that he had opened the
packet and asked Mr. Marriott which plates he desired to use.
Mr. Marriott selected the first and third. Mr. Douglas took out
the first, inserted it in the carrier, placed the black cardboard
on the top of it, then took out the third plate and placed
it also in the carrier, closed the carrier, then closed the
packet of plates and put them in his pocket. Mr. Marriott
drew the slide back and Mr. Douglas signed the plates, holding
the slide in his hand. On the return of Mr. Marriott and
Mr. Douglas from the dark room, Mr. M'Kenzie on examining
the slide said it was not the same as that which he had seen
before they went into the dark room. Mr. Douglas, on the
other hand, stated it had not left his possession. Mr. M'Kenzie,
however, continued to insist that there had been a mark
on the one slide which he could not find on the other, and
there accordingly arose a question as to what should be
done. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle expressed the opinion that
if such an emergency had arisen in a Hope sitting they would
have insisted either on an examination of Mr. Hope's person
to see if he had concealed about him a duplicate slide, or
else on his replacing the plates. It was, however, clear that

ich an emergency had not arisen in Mr. Douglas's sitting
tith Mr. Hope, and Mr. Marriott pointed out that a search
)f his person would be a departure from the agreed con-
litions and said that on that ground he objected to a search,
[r. Douglas supported him in this, but suggested that he
it be allowed to verify if the plates contained in the
lide were those which he had signed. Mr. Marriott agreeing
this, they returned to the dark room and, on emerging,
:.
Douglas reported that he had found that by some mistake
ic had signed one plate twice and the other not at all, but
tat he had rectified this and had now signed the latter
ite also. Mr. M'Kenzie asked if Mr. Marriott would allow
limself to be searched after the experiments, and to this
:. Marriott agreed. Mr. Marriott then focussed the camera
id placed in it the slide handed to him by Mr. Douglas.
Two photographs were then taken, first of Mr. Douglas
and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and then of Sir Arthur alone,
Mr. Marriott drawing and reversing the slide and exposing
the plate by lifting the black cloth, as is usual in the Hope
procedure. Mr. Marriott then said he wished to make two
more exposures, Mr. Hope having used four plates. As, how-
ever, he said he had only brought one slide, a cardboard box
had to be produced by Mr. M'Kenzie to put the already
exposed plates into. On this occasion Mr. Marriott invited all
the committee to go into the dark room to observe how the
first two plates had been loaded and signed by Mr. Douglas ;
and all went in except myself. Mr. Douglas dictated from
inside that he took the plates from the carrier and put them
into the cardboard box, and put two new plates into the
carrier and signed them. Two more exposures were then made
as before, after which all the committee except myself again
went into the dark room to watch the development. Mr.
Douglas placed all the plates into the developing dish and Mr.
Marriott poured on the developer and developed. While the
plates were in the fixing bath Mr. M'Kenzie again raised the
question of the alleged substituted slide and asked if Mr.
Marriott was prepared to be searched. Mr. Marriott consented,
and Mr. M'Kenzie proceeded to search him. He found nothing,
however, except a round object in the breast-pocket or lining
222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
of Mr. Marriott's coat, which he asked to examine. But as
Mr. Marriott pointed out that what he was searching for was
a slide, he did not persist in this. The dark room was also
searched for a slide but unsuccessfully. When the plates
were examined, the plate which Mr. Douglas had signed twice
revealed an
'
extra
'
in the shape of a young woman with
up-cast eyes between him and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, while
one of the plates of Sir Arthur alone showed a ring of fairies
dancing round him.
It is evident that no special conclusion on the main question
of the authenticity of spirit photography in general or of
Mr. Hope's mediumship in particular can be inferred from this
experiment, but it at least shows the helplessness of an
ordinary observer in the hands of a skilled operator, even
when he knows that that operator alone is to be the sole
agent unaided by spirit accomplices, and consequently the
valuelessness of the majority of the reports of successes
obtained in what appear to be test conditions. I have in
the above notes given sufficient of the details to show that
to the best of Mr. Douglas's belief, all the operations in the
dark room were performed by himself, and it is certain that
if the operator had been, not Mr. Marriott, but Mr. Hope,
the results would by many have been claimed as positive
proof of spirit agency. It is remarkable that certain corre-
spondents in the spiritualist press have actually claimed that
Mr. Marriott's success justifies their confidence in Mr. Hope.
Thus Mr. Wake Cook's faith in spirit photography is
"
streng-
thened
"
because Mr. Hope's extras grow out of a mystic
cloud while Mr. Marriott's are reproductions of drawings or
pictures. Mr. Marriott, however, can produce just as beautiful
mystic clouds as Mr. Hope, as I have seen in others of his
photographs. The particular photograph published in the
Sunday Express which he set out to imitate on this occasion
had no mystic cloud. Would Mr. Wake Cook therefore say it
was fraudulent ? Further, what about Mrs. Dean's extras ?
They are just as clearly reproductions of pictures as Mr.
Marriott's, but I have not heard it suggested that they are less
genuine than Mr. Hope's on that account. Again, Mr. M'Kenzie
writes that the experiment went merely to prove the

of the claim made by Mr. Marriott," and this on the ground
that Mr. M'Kenzie found out how he did his trick. Now, by
.Mi. Marriott's courtesy, I have been enlightened as to a good
many of his methods, and although he will probably not expect
me to attach much more credence to his statements than is due
to other conjurors when, on the stage, they show the audience
*
how they did it,' I think I can fairly confidently say that
Mr. M'Kenzie's explanation is entirely wrong, and that a
substitution of slides was quite unnecessary and did not in
fact take place. Finally, even Light itself, in an editorial
paragraph, suggests that anyone who can suppose that what
is done with so much elaboration by a highly trained conjuror
can be done by Mr. Hope and his
"
equally simple and
unskilled compeers
"
must be a very credulous person. This
is not much of a tribute to Mr. Hope, after his many years'
experience of specialising in one branch of activity, and he
might reasonably say
"
Save me from my friends." In any
case, is this not merely begging the whole question ?
Why
assume that Mr. Hope, merely because he is Mr. Hope, should
necessarily be unskilled ? I can positively assert that Mr.
Marriott's methods require no special manual dexterity ;
a
little foresight, some luck and more bluff and you get an
extra.

I. A NOTE ON THE "CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE." 1

MADAM, Further discrepancies in this case come to light,
which might well have been noticed by Mr. Myers himself.
1. In Mrs. Speer's account of these sittings (Proc. S.P.R.,
Vol. XL, p. 53) G (Grocyn) informed the sitters that the spirit
had been chosen by Imperator to give them another proof of
identity, and that he had been a spiritualist in earth-life. On
p. 85, an interview with the widow is recorded, from which it
is clear that she at least was not a spiritualist, as the article

"
evidently puzzled, though it interested
her."
2. Stainton Moses' own account of this sitting (I.e. p. 82) states
that he was in deep trance himself, but that the heavy loo
table was tilted with violence and the whole message was given
by tilts. (There is no date given to this letter to the Spiritua-
list, but it is after Dec. 11, 1874). Mrs. Speer's own account
(p. 53), apparently extracted from her diary, states omy that
the table was raised several times, and a spirit rapped on it
with much energy.
There seems to have been some "writing up" of the case, both
here, where raps become tilts, and in U.S.A., where three months*
service in 1814 entitle a man to be called in 1874
"
a veteran
of the war of 1812."
Most persons who have been present at a seance where a table
has been violently tilted will be satisfied that the movements of
the table were not controlled by the medium or sitters. It is
therefore immaterial, to speculate whether Mr. Moses or Mr. or
Mrs. Speer could have seen an American newspaper containing
the obituary notice of Abraham Florentine.
But the statements now re-examined do suggest that the
obituary notice was the source of the information given, and that,,
in short, a deliberate piece of personation was effected by the
Imperator group.
Nor was the subject to be impersonated unwisely chosen, as
it has taken nearly fifty years to invalidate what was considered
"
the best evidence ever produced for Spirit Identity
"
(p. 82).
LAWRENCE J. JONES.
(2) To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, In the November issue of the Journal attention i&
drawn to the fact that particulars of the death of Abraham
Florentine who purported to communicate through the Rev. Stainton
Moses on or before September 1st, 1874 had appeared in two
American daily newspapers on August 5th and 6th of the same year.
From this the deduction is drawn that these obituary notices
may have been seen by Mr. Moses and that the ostensible com-
munication may, therefore, be only a case of cryptomnesia.
FKH., 1922. Note on "
The Case of Abraham Florentine." '2'2~>
. _
This assumption is hardly justifiable. In 1874 no American daily
papers circulated in this country^ They would have been found
only in newspaper offices as
"
exchanges
"
or in the houses of
the few Americans then resident in England.
Mr. Moses could have had no access to these ;
so the assump-
ion that he could have ever seen the American obituary notices
may be dismissed as too wildly improbable for serious notice.
If it could be found that these notices were repeated or ab-
stracted in any British newspaper before September 1st, 1874, the
case would be altogether different. GEORGE E. WRIGHT.
(Editorial Note. It appears to us that in his letter, printed
above, Mr. Wright rather underestimates the possibility that a
copy of one of the American papers in which the obituary notices
of Abraham Florentine appeared, may have fallen under Stainton
Moses' eye. Admittedly it was not very probable that an
Englishman at that date should have seen an American paper,,
but in weighing evidence of this kind we must surely look beyond
what is
likely to have happened and consider what may have
happened. But the point to which we wished to call attention
in our original note was the strong reason we have for thinking
that the source of the knowledge shown at the sitting was one
of the obituary notices rather than the dead man himself. That
evidence has nothing to do with the question of whether Stainton
Moses himself had seen the notice.
If Sir Lawrence Jones is right in thinking that the movements
of the table were beyond anything that those present at the
sitting could themselves have produced, then evidently we must
look further afield. But before we can be certain of such a
point, do we not need a more accurate and detailed report of
what occurred at the sitting than is available in this instance ?
We have had a letter from an American correspondent, Judge
Lloyd, which has some bearing on this point. He observes that
"
the comment by Moses quoted at the foot of page 151 (of the
S.P.R. Jour.) strongly suggests that it was Moses' own subliminal
mind that had observed the obituary notices. The note book
gives first the information of name, in the American War, died
August 5, 1874, aged 83 years, 1 month, 17 days, at Brooklyn.
Then in comment Moses guesses that life had become a burden
through a painful illness. It would therefore appear that the
226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. FEB., 1922.
knowledge of the painful illness did not come from the
'
spirit,'
but was Moses' own thought. Corresponding as it does with
the obituary notice, and taken in conjunction with the purported
'
spirit
'
communication, it clearly points to Moses' own mind
having seen or observed the printed notice."
II. A SUGGESTED METHOD FOR TELEPATHIC EXPERI-
MENTS.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, Members of the Society may recollect that I recently
suggested a method of research into mediumistic and other trance
states by means of the psycho-galvanic reflex.
Owing to the difficulty of securing the services of a suitable
subject for these experiments it has not yet been possible to put
this suggestion to the test. But it has occurred to me that it
might be practicable to employ a similar method for the investiga-
tion of telepathy in a manner which, if the experiments were
successful, would possess the same advantages as I ventured to
claim for the former technique.
There seems to be some reason for thinking that "ideas'*
accompanied by relatively intense emotional feeling-tone are
more likely to be transmitted and perceived telepathically than
are "
indifferent
"
ideas. This being so, it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that the emotional state or change itself might be
equally or even more easily transmissible.
Now the psycho-galvanic reflex is by far the most delicate
and reliable indicator of emotional change at present known ;
in
fact, it is not too much to say that it is the only practicable
method for quantitative work. Furthermore, it has been found
to indicate with equal success the emotional changes induced
by any kind of stimulus, whether the words of an association-
test or such physical excitations as sudden noises, pricks, pinches,
burns, smells and the like.
I suggest, therefore, that two suitable subjects
"
agent
"
and
"percipient" -be placed in adjacent rooms and connected to two
independent installations for observing the psycho-galvanic reflex.
A succession of asserted stimuli would be applied to the "
agent
"
and his reflexes recorded. The "percipient" would be kept, as
FEB., 1922. A Suggested Method for Telepathic Experiments. 227
far as possible, totally quiescent and a similar and synchronised
record of his reactions would be made.
If there were any considerable degree of correlation between
the two records this would constitute evidence of telepathy of
a, most positive and unambiguous kind.
I am encouraged to hope that such an experiment would yield
valuable results by the fact that previous attempts at the
'
trans-
;> ivnce of sensations
'
seem to have been fairly successful on the
whole : and if the sensations can be transferred it seems impossible
to doubt that the concomitant emotional change would be capable
of detection.
In particular, I notice that in the very interesting
"
Case
"
reported in the Society's Journal for December 1921, it is stated
that [Mr. Brook] was able to transfer sensations to [Mrs. Jackson]
with considerable success. Even if
regular experimental work
is not possible in that particular case it should not be difficult
to find suitable subjects, for it is quite possible that some effect
could be obtained with people who are not known to possess
any special
"
psychic
"
gifts.
The only serious difficulty is the question of apparatus. Two
Wheatstone's bridges and two good galvanometers (preferably
reflecting, with lamps, scales, etc.) would be required, together
with a few secondary cells. It might be possible to borrow
them ;
if not I estimate that the cheapest installation would
cost about 50. Photographic recording is desirable though not
essential, but would considerably increase the expense.
But I think it possible that Members of the Society would
be willing to make a special effort to finance so promising and
fundamentally important an experiment if
they were invited
to do so.

OF THE
lociety for Psychical Research.
ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT.
As already reported in the Journal, the Council have elected
Dr. T. W. Mitchell (M.D. Edinburgh) as President of the
Society for the current year.
Dr. Mitchell has been closely connected with the modern
revival of psycho-therapeutics in England from the beginning
in 1906-1907, when "
A society for the Study of Suggestive
Therapeutics
"
(afterwards the Psycho-Medical Society); was
founded. Of this Society Dr. Mitchell was President in 1911.
He also became at the same time Hon. Secretary of the
Medical Section of the Society for Psychical Research. After
the war when the Medical Section of the British Psychological
Society, and the British Psycho-Analytical Society were founded,
the Psycho-Medical Society and the Medical Branch of the
S.P.R. ceased to exist.
Dr. Mitchell is a Member of the Council of the British
Psychological Society, and the Editor of The British Journal of
Psychology (Medical Section). He is an Associate Member of
the British Psycho-Analytical Society.
Dr. Mitchell has done much valuable work in psychical
research. He has been a Member of the Council sine 3 1909,
and is the author of numerous articles in Proceedings. He has
also published quite recently a book entitled The Psychology
of Medicine.
THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.
IN a review of the work of the Society during 1921 no single
piece of investigation stands out, as did the enquiry into
A
230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.
the phenomena of Eva C. during the early summer of 1920 ;
but there has been considerable activity in other directions.
Arising out of the Reports printed in the Proceedings and
Journal on Book-tests and Newspaper-tests obtained through
the mediumship of Mrs. Osborne Leonard, the suggestion has
been put forward in more than one quarter that the question
of what part chance coincidence could be supposed to play in
the observed results was deserving of careful consideration.
With the assistance of Colonel C. E. Baddeley, C.M.G., C.B.,
and the co-operation of some others of our members, an
enquiry into this point has been recently carried out, a report
upon which will, it is hoped, be shortly published in Proceedings.
The results appear to show that only in a very small per-
centage of cases does chance yield any considerable degree
of success.
Some experiments are at present in progress for the purpose
of testing the possibility of detecting supernormally the contents
of closed envelopes. The percipient believes himself to have
some gift of
'
this kind and on occasion obtains results which
seem considerably better than can be attributable to chance,
but the complete failures of other days make the total figures
rather disappointing.
In this connexion attention may be drawn to the com-
paratively large amount of apparent clairvoyance of which
the Society has received evidence recently. Beginning with
Mrs. Osborne Leonard's
"
Book-tests
"
in 1917-1919 (reported
in the Proceedings, Vol. XXXI.), which have more or less
continued since, we have the further development of
"
News-
paper-tests
"
received through her by Mr. Drayton Thomas,
of which an account was printed in the Journal for May.
Then there are Mr.
"
Brook's
"
book-test experiments with
his sister-in-law described in the December Journal, and
the experiments reported by Mr. Kimber in the Journal for
January, 1922. This little accumulation of cases would be
less noticeable were it not that cases of clairvoyance super-
normal perception of things not, so far as appears, in the mind
of any human being had previously been rare among the cases
about which we have received contemporary information.
Similar groups of successful experiments in various departments
have occurred before ;
success in any branch of psychical re-
MAI:., 102-2. Annual Report of the Council. 231
search tending apparently to produce further success, probably
because the interest aroused leads others to try for the phenomena
to which attention is at the moment directed. Thus in the early
days of the Society we received many very interesting accounts
of telepathic experiments, transference of ideas, diagrams, etc.
The importance of experiments of this kind has not diminished,
but apparently the interest felt in them by our members has,
and we hear of but few. Again, when cross-correspondences
were first discussed in our Proceedings, others followed, and
automatists who had not been in touch with us before pro-
duced them. Or, to go back to days before the Society was
founded, phenomena, possibly telepathic and apparently clair-
voyant, in connexion with mesmerism were observed in the
earlier part of the last century much more frequently than
they are now, probably because they were more sought after
and expected. Physicians practising hypnotism are now
more exclusively intent on its therapeutic uses, and lay
persons are more aware of its possible abuses and less in-
clined to experiment with it. As an experimental method
for psychical research hypnotism has thus suffered some-
what through its recognition by orthodox science. Again,
in the middle of last century table-turning and rapping
were in great vogue stimulated, in the first instance, [by
the
Rochester knockings, which may or may not themselves have
been genuine phenomena. Among the extraordinary things
said to have occurred in private circles at that time, very
few have been recorded in a way to be of any scientific use ;
but some may have been genuine and not attributable to
unconscious muscular action, and, if so, it is probable that
experiments attempted on the same scale now and with the
same interest and expectation of success would again yield a
crop of interesting phenomena. This all points to the im-
portant work our members might do. If they all experimented
in whatever department of our work specially interested them,
a certain number would very likely find they had super-
normal faculty of one sort or another, and psychical research
would be proportionately advanced.
The Society is sometimes accused of neglecting its oppor-
tunities for investigating the phenomena of well-known mediums,
and we therefore take this occasion to re-affirm that this
282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. -MAR., 1922.
apparent neglect is not due to any indifference on the part
of the Council, but to the unwillingness of some mediums to
submit to such test-conditions as we consider absolutely
necessary for a scientific enquiry. A few months ago, for
example, it was suggested through a private source that the
Society should undertake an investigation of the phenomena
said to occur in the presence of Miss Bessinet. The officers of
the Society expressed willingness to undertake the task and
suggested the appointment of a committee of investigation, but
the scheme fell through owing to the refusal of the medium to
submit to any test-conditions. Her refusal was said to be in
part due to an experience she had recently had when giving
a test-sitting elsewhere ; but, however that may be, the Council
cannot be held to blame in the matter.
That remarkable phenomena can be obtained under very
stringent conditions is proved by the case of Eva C. The
nature of the phenomena observed in the presence of this
medium may still be an open question, but at least she cannot
be accused of refusing to lend herself to scientific enquiry ;
and if other mediums would follow her example, the progress
of psychical research might be materially assisted.
Minor experiments carried out during the past year include
some in
"
psychometry." The results obtained so far, though
not without interest, are not sufficiently definite to warrant
publication.
Mr. Gardner Murphy, Lecturer on Psychology at Columbia
University, New York, and a member of our Society, has
begun a series of long-distance thought-transference experi-
ments between agents and percipients in different parts of the
world, and some members of the Society are taking part in
these experiments.
It was with much interest that we learnt in the summer
that our President during 1920 and 1921, Dr. M'Dougall (who
is now a Professor at Harvard University, U.S.A.), had been
elected to the Presidency of the American Society for Psychical
Research and had accepted the office.
The first International Congress for Psychical Research was
held at Copenhagen during the last days of August, 1921,
under the auspices of the Danish Society for Psychical Research.
Mrs. W. H. Salter attended the Congress as the official repre-
[AH., 1922. Annual Report of the Council. 233
sentative of our Society, and her report on the Congress was
printed in the Journal for December. Several other members
of the Society were present, some of whom read papers.
As regards membership the Society still continues to suffer
from the general necessity for retrenchment resulting from high
prices and the diminished value of money. In numbers the
Society has slightly declined during the past year, but its
income from subscriptions has remained almost exactly the
same. This is due to the fact that whereas many of those
who have resigned were Associates, paying only one guinea a
year, no new Associates have been admitted, and only
Members, who pay two guineas, have been elected. In only
two cases has any dissatisfaction with the Society's work been
expressed by those who have resigned. In one case the
dissatisfaction appears to be of a vague and general character,
and in the other an Associate gives as her reasons for resigning,
first, that the Society does not aid
"
the individual Member
or Associate to educate himself in matters psychical," and,
secondly, that she grudges the time taken in attending meetings
"
to hear a read address." This lady must apparently have
joined the Society under a misapprehension as to its objects,
which have never included the training of its members in
matters psychical. Its business, like that of other scientific
societies, is the investigation of phenomena of a certain type,
the publication of results, and the provision of facilities for
studying the literature of the subject. Its officers are, however,
always ready, if asked, to give such advice and guidance
as they can to members engaging in investigations on their
own account. A considerable number of persons, in tendering
their resignation, have expressly stated that they acted from
motives of economy and regretted the necessity ;
in some
instances they have expressed a hope of rejoining later.
The total number of resignations received during the past
year has been 32 Members and 42 Associates ;
the names of
10 Members and 13 Associates have been removed from the
lists for non-payment of subscriptions ;
and 9 Members and
17 Associates have died. The loss from death has, for the
past few years, been considerably above the previous yearly
average.
Eighty-eight new Members (including two Corresponding
A2
234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.
Members, one of whom was formerly an Associate), and two
Honorary Associates (one of whom was formerly an Associate)
have been elected, and ten Associates have become Members.
The total membership of the Society now stands at 1266, of
whom 510 are Members and 756 are Associates.
Among the losses by death we must specially mention
Professor Beaunis of Nancy at the age of 94. He was the
last survivor of the original Nancy school of hypnotism which
played so important a part in the development of the treat-
ment of disease by suggestion, and he had been a corre-
sponding Member of our Society since 1886. The Members of
the Nancy group best known in England were probably Pro-
fessor Bernheim and Dr. Liebeault, and they too and also
Professor Liegeois were corresponding Members of our Society.
Professor Bernheim lived till 1919, and his death should have
been recorded in a previous report by the Council.
An increased use has been made of the Library during the
year. In part this is doubtless due to the fact that all persons
now admitted to the Society are Members and as such have
the right to borrow books. But in part it may be attributed
to a widespread interest in psychical research and a wish to
become acquainted with recent developments of the subject.
From the financial point of view the past year has not been
without its difficulties. The Society's income from all sources
was slightly larger in 1921 than in 1920. Among the causes
of increase may be mentioned the receipt of royalties on the
sale of the abridged edition of Phantasms of the Living, and the
increased sale of the Society's publications in the United
States by the F. W. Faxon Co. The Society has also been
favoured with several special Annual Subscriptions and Dona-
tions for which the Council wish to take this opportunity of
expressing their thanks. The ordinary subscriptions from
Life Members, Members, and Associates taken together also
show an increase.
On the expenditure side the most serious item is the cost
of printing the Proceedings and Journal, which shows a rise
of approximately 450 over the corresponding figure for 1920.
For the first time since 1915 the Society has resumed publica-
tion on something approaching the pre-war scale, while the
cost of printing per page has been much higher than in any
"
., 1922. Annual Report of the Council. 235
vious year. A decrease in cost has however recently taken
place, and there is good reason to anticipate further decreases
the near future.
Mrs. Salter has resigned her position as Research Officer,
and while retaining the Editorship of the Proceedings and
Journal has generously refused to take any salary, thus
materially helping to reduce the financial stress arising from
the high cost of printing. She being now an honorary officer of
the Society, the Council have co-opted her as a member of their
body.
It is clear that, unless the Society's income can be substantially
increased, lack of funds will seriously limit the research work
which it can undertake. In spite of these difficulties, how-
ever, the Society has decided for the present, at any rate,
to increase its financial liabilities in one respect. Since Miss
Alice Johnson's resignation in 1916 the Society has had no
paid Research Officer, and, although much useful unpaid work
has been done, it has been felt recently that the Society's
regular staff was not sufficiently large to cope with all the
various opportunities which arise for experimental work and
for enquiry into spontaneous phenomena. The Council have
decided to appoint a Research Officer, having been partly
influenced in this decision by the circumstance of a very
suitable candidate presenting himself in the person of Mr.
E. J. Dingwall. Mr. Dingwall, who has a wide knowledge
of the various branches of psychical research, proved himself a
very good observer when he took part in the recent enquiry
into the phenomena of Eva C. During the past year he has
been in America as Director of the Department of Physical
Phenomena in the American Society for Psychical Research,
in which capacity we understand he has carried out his duties
very efficiently. For financial reasons his appointment, which
is for part time only, has been made provisionally for one
year.
Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey is among those who retire from mem-
bership of the Council this year in rotation, and as he has
for some time past been unable to attend meetings on account
of ill-health, he has decided not to stand for re-election. Dr.
Tuckey has been a member of the Council since 1897, and
before that had served on the Library Committee and on the

also written notes and a good many reviews for the 1

ceedings and Journal. The Society therefore owes him a debt
of gratitude. He was one of the pioneers in the use of
hypnotism in therapeutics in this country, and his book on
psycho-therapy has gone through many 'editions. We lose in
him a colleague whose interest in psychical research has been
of much value to the Society, and we are glad to know that
his interest will not be diminished by his withdrawal from
active work.

ON "
THE MODUS OPERANDI OF SO-CALLED
MEDIUMISTIC TRANCE." *
BY COLONEL C. E. BADDELEY, C.M.G., C.B.
THE perusal of (Una) Lady Troubridge's most interesting and
suggestive paper made me wonder whether she has read Henry
1
Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIL, p. 344 ff.
[AR., 1922. So-called Afediumistic Trance. 239
>lt's discussion on the nature of trance personalities, contained
Chapter L., Vol. II., of his book, On the Cosmic Relations,
ige 839 et seq.
It is undoubtedly true that some
"
trance controls
"
exhibit in
striking degree the characteristics of certain
"
secondary per-
malities
"
who have been studied, but it may be argued that
te resemblance is merely fortuitous. Lady Troubridge cites the
points of resemblance between
"
Feda,"
"
Margaret," and
"
Nellie,"
Mrs. Thompson's child control, and Sally Beauchamp No. II., but
there are no points of resemblance in this latter personality to
the characteristics displayed by other trance controls, such as
"
Dr. Phinuit,"
"
Imperator,"
"
Rector," or
"
Mr. D ," another
of Mrs. Thompson's controls. The pranks played by Feda on her
medium, Mrs. Leonard, might, on the assumption that Feda is a
separate entity, quite naturally be explained by her rather childish,
mischievous, and not very highly developed character ; Sally
Beauchamp No. II. was inspired by quite a different motive in
the pranks she played upon Sally Beauchamp No. I. : it was
resentment against the latter for occupying the human organism
which she considered to be her property, and the acts were
generally malicious and not merely mischievous.
In view of Feda's claim to have been an Indian girl it is
curious to note that she seems to exhibit many of the char-
acteristics of a spoilt uneducated young Hindu woman, and many
of the things done by her to Mrs. Leonard, as related by Lady
Troubridge, are just the sort of uncouth and unconventional
acts that might be perpetrated by a young Hindu woman. Some
of Feda's remarks are put in terms that are strongly reminiscent
of
"
English, as she is spoke
"
by Indians with an imperfect
knowledge of English. For instance, Feda was once asked whether
the communicator liked the music that was played in the house
of the sitters. She replied : "He says he likes the thing that is
played outside better than the
'
thing what you tap it's teeth.'
"
That is purely Hindu-English.
It may be explained that the musical instruments referred to
were respectively a gramophone and a piano !
It would be interesting to know whether her Indian sitters
consider that Feda has at all made good her claim to have been
a native of India, but I understand that she is so proud of
having become by marriage a native of Scotland that she will
not talk much about India !
240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1022.
In comparing Feda with Sally Beauchamp No. II., Lady Trou-
bridge lays stress on Feda's want of sympathy and instances her
callousness over the idea of Miss R. H. passing over and com-
municating. The attitude of mind would be callousness in a
human being, even in the guise of a secondary personality, but
I fail to see that it betrays callousness if Feda is a separate
discarnate entity. In such case she might be expected to take
quite a different view of the parting by death to that taken by
human beings in the flesh. This would also explain a certain
want of sympathy with human bereavement which Lady Trou-
bridge has noticed, which is perfectly natural if Feda's different
standpoint is taken into consideration, combined with the certain
childishness of character she displays.
In spite of this, 'Feda" presents a very attractive and even
lovable personality, and one so marked that I defy anyone who
has got to know her well to treat her otherwise than as a distinct
person.
The fundamental points of difference between
"
trance controls
"
and
"
secondary personalities
"
are (1) that the latter have never
shown any evidence of being able to acquire, information
"
super-
normally," and (2) that they claim to be the rightful
"
owners
"
of the human organism through whom they manifest. Sally
Beauchamp No. II. considered that she was the true Sally Beau-
champ and that the normal Sally Beauchamp was an interloper.
I have never heard of such a claim being put forward by a
trance control ; they may take pleasure in manifesting through
their
"
medium," but
"
Dr. Phinuit
"
did not claim that he was
the rightful Mrs. Piper, or
"
Nellie
"
that she was the real Mrs.
Thompson, nor does
"
Feda
"
claim that she ought to occupy
Mrs. Leonard's organism permanently. They each of them have
a self-imposed
"
mission," which is to bring evidence for survival,
and to form a channel of communication between those who have
departed this life and those still on earth. Feda takes her mission
very seriously, and is insistent on accuracy and good evidence, as
befits an
"
honourable (sic) member of the Psychical Society,"
which she considers herself to be. At the same time she obviously
enjoys her work, and the faculty of talking through her medium,
for as she once said to a sitter :
' '
Feda loves chattering, Feda
would like to have six mediums !
"
Lady Troubridge lays little stress on the nature of the informa-
tion given by Feda and by other trance controls, and yet to
MAR., 1922. So-called Mediumistic Trance. 241
omit this point is like leaving out Hamlet in Shakespeare's play
Hamlet.
Apart from the fact that these controls occupy themselves
almost exclusively with the affairs of deceased persons, about
whom secondary personalities show no concern or interest, no one
with any considerable experience of seances can deny that, what-
ever the source of the information, it is acquired
"
supernormally
"
;
we may adopt all sorts of theories, such as telepathy, thought-
reading, exteriorisation of the medium's subconscious, etc., but the
fact remains that the medium does not acquire the knowledge
through the ordinary sense channels. But secondary personalities
do not show any faculty of acquiring information supernormally.
Finally, there is the question of
"
sex
"
: Mrs. Piper's controls
were
"
Dr. Phinuit,"
"
Imperator," and
"
Rector
"
;
Mrs. Thomp-
son had one man control,
"
Mr. D-
"
;
in other words, the
sex of a trance control is not necessarily that of the control's
medium, whereas I have never heard of the case of an unquestion-
able secondary personality who professed to be of different sex
from that of the primary personality. Sally Beauchamp No. I.
becomes Sally Beauchamp No. II., she does not become
"
Johnny
"
Beauchamp.
1
Undoubtedly, the reluctance to accept these trance controls at
their
"
face value
"
is partly due to the dislike of admitting a
super
"
natural
"
explanation so long as a
"
natural
"
explanation
is possible, but it is also partly due to their
"
queerness." What
is one to make of these controls :
Feda, Nellie, Sunshine, Belle,
Pansy, Topsy, or even of the great
"
Imperator
"
himself ? Dr.
Phinuit has always seemed to me so much more natural, in spite
of the fact that his identity was never satisfactorily established.
Indeed I thought he might have excellent reasons for not wishing
his identity to be revealed.
Anyway, I think I have shown that it is at least quite as
difficult to explain away trance controls by saying that they are
secondary personalities as it is to accept them as real and
separate discarnate intelligences, and for the moment we have to
leave it at that !
It is interesting to compare the methods by which Feda osten-
1
There is a possible exception in the case of William Sharp and "
Fiona
MacLeod," but a careful study of the biography of William Sharp strongly
inclines me to the belief that the case is of the
"
control
"
type rather
than of the true secondary personality type.
242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1022.
sibly gets her information with the methods of a good clairvoyant
medium, such as, say, Mrs. Elliott (Violet Ortner).
The latter
"
sees
"
persons, who appear, more or less, solid and
concrete, and for a greater or less duration of time. They will
often reappear, wearing some special article of dress or carry-
ing some object, such^
as a ring, or flowers, to which atten-
tion may be drawn. Pictures will be seen and described by
the medium, shown with the object of illustrating an event
or a name, or with some symbolic meaning. She will also
occasionally see a sentence or a word, as if written up, and will
decipher it.
Presumably these visions are internal, and are projected ex-
ternally by the medium's mind. The effect is as if some one
were visualising very vividly and were projecting the visualisation
telepathically into the medium's brain.
She will also get the impression of
"
hearing/' as if words had
actually been spoken, although the apparent sound is evident to
the medium only. Now all these methods are used by Feda,
and it certainly tends to support the hypothesis that Feda is a
secondary personality of Mrs. Leonard, receptive to impressions
just as Mrs. Elliott is in her normal personality. Almost the only
difference is that one can talk freely to Feda and ask questions,
whereas to do this in the case of a clairvoyant medium is to risk
a serious interruption in the flow of communication.
At the same time it is just possible to imagine Feda as the
recurring possession by a separate entity of Mrs. Leonard, the
latter's own personality being temporarily excluded from the use
of her brain and organism, and the possessing entity receiving
and giving information in exactly the same way as does the
personality of the clairvoyant medium.
With regard to the source of the
"
communications," the repre-
sentations given, and the events related, are so unexpected that
one feels obliged to rule out telepathy from the conscious mind
of the sitter, especially as so much that is actively in the thoughts
of the sitter is never given.
Pure mind-reading by the medium of the contents of the
subconscious mind of the sitter is met by the difficulty of account-
ing for the selective agency.
To account for the phenomenon by any process of thought-
reading, one is obliged to enlist the active co-operation of the
subconscious mind of the sitter, and to conceive that the whole
MAR., 1922. So-called Mediumistic Trance. 243
impersonation is engineered by this subconscious mind, and
conveyed telepathically to the medium.
I do not think that this point has been taken sufficiently into
account, or rather, I think that there has been confusion of
thought between telepathy from the mind of the sitter to that
of the medium, and the reading of the mind of the sitter by
the medium.
So long as the latter theory was restricted to the reading of
the sitter's conscious thoughts, it might be argued that the medium
found the conception of a certain personality, with appropriate
incidents and memories, ready present to hand, but the case
is different when the hypothesis is used to explain the extraction
of relevant incidents and memories from among the mass of
memories in the subconscious mind of the sitter, and still more
so from among the memories in the subconscious mind of a third
party or parties. Especially in the case of an anonymous sitter,
the medium cannot possibly have the equipment, so to speak,
to enable him to select.
It appears to me neither scientific nor legitimate to adopt
different hypotheses of mind communication to explain different
portions of a
"
sitting," just as may be convenient ;
to be valid
a hypothesis must cover all the facts.
The only hypothesis that seems to cover all the facts is the
assumption that it is the subconscious mind of the sitter that
does the whole thing ;
on this assumption the subconscious mind
of the sitter creates the communicating personality with its
characteristics and idiosyncrasies ;
its dialogue, with appropriate
expressions and modes of thought ; groups around it relevant
incidents and memories ;
searches out others from among the
mass of memories in the subconscious minds of third parties ;
and even exercises a mysterious power of
"
lucidity
"
in arranging
such tests as
"
book tests," and in relating incidents not known
to any one person (such as the
"
Charlie L." test of Mr. Irving).
The whole of this information would then be conveyed in some
telepathic manner to the medium, who thus must be looked upon
merely as the vehicle through which it is retransmitted back to
the astonished conscious mind of the sitter. The only alternative
to the above theory that to my mind in any way covers all the
facts is the
"
spiritistic
"
hypothesis.

A CASE IN WHICH A FACT, APPARENTLY KNOWN
TO A DEAD MAN ONLY, WAS COMMUNICATED IN
A VISION.
(We give below some extracts (translated] from, the report of an
interesting case which appeared in the Revue Spirite for
April 1921. The original report ivas by Monsieur Camille
Flammarion, and we have to thank the editor of the Revue
Spirite for permission to reprint it
here.)
CASES in which the dead have manifested themselves in such
a way as to compel our attention by reason of the certain
authenticity of the manifestations are extremely rare. Gener-
ally speaking, the possibility of some mental action on the
part of living persons can only be eliminated with great
difficulty, and our efforts to reach the truth do not lead to
any results comparable for precision to the calculation of
mathematical equations, which proceeds by the sure elimination
of erroneous numbers and leaves upon the board a figure
which is absolutely definite.
In the remarkable case with which we are here concerned,
we are really unable to find any other explanation than a
recognition of personal action on the part of the dead man, and
I thank the observer for having kindly allowed me to lay
before all those who desire to solve the greatest of all problems
the eloquent report with which she has furnished me.
The following, then, was the letter addressed to me from
Paris, under the date of the 7th of last February :
To add one more piece of evidence to the important enquiry
which you are carrying out, allow me to give you an account of
the two following events of my own experience :
(The writer then describes how on September 2, 1916, between 10
and 11 a.m., whilst in her room dressing, she was suddenly seized
with a sensation of terrible distress accompanied by a feeling of
suffocation. She said to her daughter that some great disaster had
befallen her son, Rene. Two days later she was informed by the
chief of his squadron that her son, a pilot in the flying corps, had
disappeared over the German lines near Verdun on the day and at
the hour of her distressing experience.)
It was only after the armistice that the Germans vouchsafed
to tell us that our son had been brought down in their lines on
MAH., 1922. Case. 245
the 2nd of September, at Dieppe, near Verdun, and that he had
been buried in the military cemetery at Dieppe, grave No. 56.
We went to the place four times and searched again and again
in the cemetery in which there were only two Frenchmen (all
the rest were Germans), but we found nothing. The cemetery
had been churned up by shells, and most of the crosses were
broken. Seeing that we could not find the remains of our dear
son, we spoke to the officer in command of the section, whose
duty it was to take up the bodies, and asked him to let us
know on what day the bodies in that cemetery were to be taken
up. . . . This happened last spring.
On the 25th of May [1920], at half-past eight [p.m.], I was
seized with a feeling of intense sadness. I was more sad than
usual, and without reason, and in order to shake myself out of
this state of profound gloom, 1 went to the window, and turned
my gaze up the Rue Ribera, which was just over the way. There
are some trees there, and a little blue sky. Suddenly, in a group
of trees, / saw my son, Rene, appear! His beautiful face was
pale and sad ;
he was, as it were, in a great medallion ;
on each
side of him were two young men, one to the right, one to the
left ;
I did not know them, I had never seen them. Terrified
by this vision I left the window, and clasped my head in my
hands, asking myself if I were going mad. I walked about the
room a little in this manner, and then returned to the window 5
the vision was still there ! There was no doubt ;
it was Rene.
His head was leaning to the left, as was a habit of his. But
who could the young men be ? The one on the right appeared
to be a Russian, the one on the left a German. But then ? . . .
My son was not dead, he must be a prisoner somewhere. Still
overwhelmed with fright, I again left the window, and ran to
tell my husband, but when I got to the door of his room, I
pulled myself together and thought :
"
No. I must not tell him,
he would think me mad, it would grieve him too much. What
am I to do ?
"
I returned to the window ;
the vision was still
there. This time I sat down on the window sill, determined to
stay there to the end, near him. What happened ? I came to
myself again. Had I been asleep ? Or had I lost consciousness ?
I no longer saw my son. I got up with difficulty, left the window,
and looked at the time. If was half-past ten. All this had
lasted two hours. I went to bed, much troubled, broken with
emotion, but I could not sleep ;
and I dared not say anything to
246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.
my husband. What did the vision mean ? I constantly asked
myself this question.
A few days later I told my whole experience to three of my
friends, who can corroborate my statement, if
you wish.
Three months passed. Then, at the end of August, the officer
in command of the section in reply to a letter from my husband,
more pressing than the others, told us that the cemetery at
Dieppe had been taken up, and our boy was not there ;
there
was no possible doubt about it. We were greatly distressed.
How were we ever to know now what had become of our poor
boy ? For my part, I was in despair. After being for a few
days quite overwhelmed, I took courage again and wished to
return to the cemetery at Dieppe ;
I was absolutely set on this.
My husband was opposed to the suggestion, saying, very reason-
ably, that having failed to find anything when there were bodies
there, we had nothing whatever to hope for now. Nothing could
convince me, and yielding to my absolutely fixed determination,
my husband agreed to accompany me. We started in the first
days of September.
We went straight to the section d'Eix . . . and having obtained
from the officer in command the use of a carriage and some
men, I asked him on what day he had taken up the cemetery.
He opened his register, and replied :
"
The operation lasted five
days (there were 110 bodies), from the 20th to the 25th of May."
The last date was precisely that of my vision ! I looked at my
husband, for, most fortunately, I had decided to tell him every-
thing. This coincidence of date had a great effect upon both
of us. ...
When we reached our destination, I ordered the men to search
in a big shell hole, thinking that the place was not likely to have
been searched before. They found a pair of aviator's spectacles.
I felt encouraged ; beyond doubt an airman had been buried
here. The men searched further, but found nothing, absolutely
nothing. At last a young soldier, very intelligent, took the plan
of the cemetery and followed it letter by letter. We came in
this way to an empty ditch in which we found a big piece of
fur, which I recognised, some gloves, and some fragments of
braces made of violet silk. . . . Without a doubt my son had
been there.
"
Where have you put him ?
"
In the German
cemetery, under the title
"
Unknown "
and a black cross. . . .
Immediately I wished to go on to the other cemetery ;
I would
MAK., 1922. Case. 247
not have my son remain there. But the officer refused on the
ground that he had no authority to take up bodies in coffins.
And then, how were we to find the one we sought ? There were
more than 2000 graves in this German cemetery. But I was
determined. We returned to Verdun . . . and sought out the
officer in command of the graves' commission. After a long
discussion ... he yielded, and gave us authority to make a
search. Next day at 5 in the morning we were at the cemetery.
... By 12 o'clock 20 coffins had been opened without any
result. The men went to dinner, and my husband and I stayed
there, greatly depressed ; for we were beginning to lose hope. . . .
Suddenly, I thought of my vision, and as though a flash of light
had passed through my brain, I said :
"
Yes, we shall find him ;
he is between a Russian and a German. There was a Russian
in the cemetery at Dieppe ;
let us look for him." The men
came back and resumed their work, whilst we ourselves looked
for the Russian. ... At last, at 4 o'clock, I found the Russian.
To his left there was an unknown soldier, and to the left of
the unknown a German. Beyond all -doubt the unknown is my
son, I feel it, I am sure of it ! The men proceeded to dig. It
was he ! His poor skeleton was in the middle of his fur, very
well preserved. There were some more fragments of braces. But
what I particularly recognised was his teeth. Forty-two coffins
had been opened ;
there were 110 that came from the cemetery
at Dieppe, and altogether more than 2000 coming from different
places ! Without the help of my vision, we should have had to
give it up.
Is it not wonderful ?
My dear boy would not have me leave
him in that cemetery, he would not have me suffer that addition
to my cruel grief ;
he came to my aid, he gave me the strength
of will to go on to the end, to overcome all difficulties, all
obstacles, and since then I have been calm, I feel that he lives
and sees me. But what I find most strange of all in my vision
is the portrait of those two young men ;
it must have been
their actual features that I saw. . . .
My husband and friends will certainly corroborate the scrupulous
accuracy of this report. . . .
A. CLARINVAL.
(There follows a corroborative statement from Madame ClarinvaVs
husband, a retired army officer. He bears out Madame ClarinvaVs
248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.. MAR., 1922.
statement in all particulars, including the fact that she had men-
tioned her vision to him before the finding of the grave. Only the
last paragraphs of his report need be quoted here.)
The cemetery at Dieppe was taken up between the 20th and
the 25th of May, 1920. Now it was exactly on the 25th of May,
1920, that my wife had that vision, and, according to the en-
quiries we made, it was upon that very date, the 25th of May,
that the remains of our son were transferred from the cemetery
at Dieppe to the German cemetery.
I can therefore corroborate the exact correspondence of this
event, and will add that my wife has a clear and well-balanced
mind, and her mental attitude is always so sane and reasonable
that I confess to having been strongly impressed by the account
she gave me of this apparition which lasted fully two hours. The
event is all the more noteworthy in that she is not in any way
subject to hallucination, and that in all her life, that is to say,
in the course of sixty-three years, she has never had any other
vision.
(Monsieur Flammarion then quotes the testimony of a medical man
to the effect that Madame Clarinval has never suffered from any
kind of mental trouble, and corroborative statements from three friends
of Madame Clarinval's to whom she spoke of her experience about
a week after its occurrence, that is to say, some months before her
visit to Verdun, and the search for her son's body. Monsieur Flam-
marion then proceeds to discuss the case, and we print below some
extracts from his conclusions.}
Such are the irrefutable facts, established by corroborative
statements. The manifestation took place long after death, the
interval being from September 2, 1916, to May '25, 1920, that
is to say, three years, eight months, and twenty-six days.
What conclusion can we draw from this case affecting our
own personal convictions ?
. . . There is no doubt as to the authenticity of the vision,
nor as to its connexion with the finding of the young airman's
body, and we can all realise what consolation was thus afforded
to the sorrowing parents ;
the body of their beloved boy is
now here in this city of Paris, where they live. Nothing, or
all but nothing, is left of the body ;
but this body was only
the garment of the soul, and they know that this soul has
survived the catastrophe of death, that it has manifested
MAR., 1922. Case. 249
itself, and guided them in their vigorous and persevering
search. Doubtless we are not yet entirely satisfied ;
we should
like to know more, and we ask ourselves what reason there
was for the symbolism of the vision, why this enigmatic
apparition between a Russian and a German ? It would seem
as if it had been simpler for Rene Clarinval to convey to his
mother the direct information that he had been killed on the
2nd of September, and buried in such and such a place.
(We might possibly imagine that Madame Clarinval's mind
being constantly directed towards her son, she had been
momentarily endowed with the faculty of seeing at a distance,
or rather, of apprehending what was happening, and we might
also suppose that this apprehension was externalised before her
eyes into a living scene this apparition of her son between a
Russian and a German. But then why did her vision not
correspond with the reality ? I have published so many
instances of exact visions at a distance that this interpretation
seems very doubtful and less probable than some psychic
action on the part of the dead.)
We must not, we cannot, judge from our own terrestrial
standpoint. The invisible world is still entirely to discover ;
we know neither its laws nor its conditions.
CORRESPONDENCE.
I. ON "
THE READING OF CLOSED BOOKS APPARENTLY
BY CLAIRVOYANCE."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
DEAR MADAM, I am much struck with the clairvoyant case
reported in the Journal.1
The case has resemblances to the
modern Greek writing obtained by Prof. Richet through a Madame
X. (Proc., Vol. XIX., pp. 162-261) ;
and Mrs. Sidgwick's questions,
which are (naturally) much to the point, tend to bring this
similarity out.
The one thing which is thoroughly excluded is chance coinci-
dence. The thing which is not excluded, and which was held to
be possible in the Greek case, is purposed memorising by Mrs.
"Jackson
"
of some accessible book and then leading up to its
selection, the choice of the page memorised remaining with her.
1
Jour. S.P.E., Vol. XX., p. 179 (December, 1921).
250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 102!
It is a far-fetched and difficult hypothesis, and, under the circum-
stances, I suppose, absurd, but no hypothesis that is not rather
difficult can account for the reading of a closed book.
It will be remembered that the same thing was done by Stainton
Moses, who read a long extract from an out-of-the-way book in
Dr. Speer's library a book which he pretty certainly had not
seen before. 1
In that case it was supposed to be done by some
communicating entity with superhuman powers. In the present
case the reading is supposed to be done by the superhuman
faculty of Mrs. Jackson herself. But both hypotheses are gra-
tuitous, and the simple fact is that we do not know how it is
done. The feeling of the clairvoyant that she is doing it herself
lacks any force as evidence ;
and the earlier phenomena, reported
of Mrs. Jackson's powers, associate her with Home in a way
which may possibly be instructive.
Direct telepathic receptive faculty seems demonstrated by the
pain and taste experiments.
May I congratulate Mr.
"
Brook
"
on his important experiences,
and on the very appropriate time which he has chosen to narrate
them. I have long held that book-tests, as such, have no bearing
on human survival, indeed that they rather tend to militate
against the evidence for it, inasmuch as a clairvoyant power of
reading records complicates the issue by depriving a large number
of statements about things known to deceased persons of evidential
value. The only way in which book-tests bear upon the question
of survival is as to the matter selected and the manner in which
it is introduced and applied to the right people. This part of
the evidence remains still strong, in my judgment, quite apart
from the mere power of reading. The power of reading proves
nothing by itself, one way or the other, except that it establishes
an unknown faculty without discriminating whether that faculty
belongs to an incarnate or a discarnate person.
OLIVER LODGE.
(We print below a reply from Mr. Brook in regard to the hypo-
thesis put forward by Sir Oliver Lodge :)
I am glad to have an opportunity of clearing up one point in
the letter from Sir Oliver Lodge which you have kindly shown
to me.
The hypothesis of
"
purposed memorising by Mrs. Jackson of
some accessible book
"
is one which cannot by any stretch be

made to fit in with the circumstances in which the tests took
place. In the cases in which I chose the book the selection was
made entirely at random, and there was no
"
leading up
"
to
such selection. Further, the passage was written in such circum-
stances as to exclude the possibility of memorising between the
time of my selection and the time of writing. In the case of
Farwell on Powers, selected by Mrs. Jackson, she was in my
chambers, where the book is kept, for only a short time, and
during the whole of that time I was in the room with her ;
she
did not even touch the book, but merely remarked on the title
as curious ;
and the writing was done partly the same evening
at home, and partly in the tube next morning. I may add that
Mrs. Jackson has little or no power of memorising, and that her
general reading is strictly limited in range ;
such works as Sidg-
wick's Methods of Ethics lie entirely outside this range.
There is one further point. Mrs. Jackson's power of writing
passages contained in a closed book may, I think, bear some
analogy to her power of
"
seeing
"
the face of a card by looking
only at the back of the card. I have observed her go through
a pack in this way ;
on checking the cards afterwards with the
description of them which she had written down, I have found
the amount of error to be about 5 per cent.

II. A NEGLECTED METHOD OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
THE UNIVERSITY, BRISTOL.
DEAR MADAM, It has struck me that we might with great
advantage supplement our other methods of research by the use
of the dictaphone in cases of alleged
"
direct control." We are
told that in certain cases a medium will claim to be directly
controlled by the spirit of a dead person, and that under these
circumstances she will speak in tones and with an accent which
distinctly recall those of the alleged communicator. (Cf. the
paper by Miss RadclynVHall and Lady Troubridge on Mrs.
Leonard's mediumship in S.P.R. Proceedings, Part 84.)
It is clearly very desirable that a permanent record should be
made of such voices, so that they may be studied at leisure and
submitted to other friends of the deceased person beside the
actual sitter, Otherwise it is very difficult to know what weight
252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAR., 1922.
to attach to the statement that the
"
direct
"
voices resemble
those of the alleged communicators. Obviously the ideal case
would be to have records (a) of a man's voice during his lifetime,
(6) of the voice of the medium when she claims to be controlled
by this man, (c) of the voice of the medium when under her
normal control, and (d) of the voice of the medium when not
in trance.
It ought not to be impossible for those who sit frequently
(say) with Mrs. Leonard to arrange some sufch experiment with
"
Feda," and thus at least get records of the kinds (&), (c), and
(d). As regards (a) might it not be worth while for some of us
to deposit with the Society dictaphone records of our ordinary
mode of speaking, so that if
any medium professes to be con-
trolled by us after our death a perfectly objective comparison of
the voices could be made ? This would at least supplement the
"
sealed letter
"
tests which past members of the Society have
made with such lamentably negative results.
I do not know what conclusion if
any about survival could be
based on the success of a series of such experiments. But it
would at least establish definitely a very interesting and possibly
important fact which would be incapable of normal explanation.

REVIEW.
The Mystery of Existence and A Brief Study of the Sex Problem.
By C. W. ARMSTRONG. (Grant Richards, 6s. net.)
This book, which was first issued in 1909, has now been re-issued
with considerable additions. It consists in the main of an
exposition of the philosophical views of the author, who has
been a member of this Society for many years ;
it has no direct
bearing upon psychical research, except in so far as these views
are the outcome of Mr. Armstrong's study of psychical phenomena
and in particular of the work of Frederic Myers,
whose discovery of the Subliminal Self I must regard as almost more
epoch-making than Darwin's discovery of the laws of Natural Selection.
The great importance I attach to this discovery will be better under-
stood when, further on, I come to state the functions which I attribute
to the subliminal self, functions greater and more far-reaching than
Myers himself ever suggested.
"PSYCHIC" PHOTOGRAPHY.
THE Research Officer would be glad if those Members and Associates
of the Society who have experiments in view with Mr. Hope, Mrs.
Deane, or Mr. Vearncombe, would communicate with him before
arranging their sittings.

REPORT OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS
FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.
WK have been informed by the Secretary of the Danish
Society for Psychical Research, who is acting Secretary of
the International Committee, that the Official Report of
the First Congress, held last year at Copenhagen, is now
ready. It is a volume of about 500 pages with numerous
illustrations, and the price is 15 crowns (Danish). It can be
obtained from the Danish Society for Psychical Research,
7 Graabrodretorv, Copenhagen.
In the brief report of the Congress printed in the Journal
for last November, we referred to the Danish Society as newly
constituted. Their Secretary draws our attention to the
fact that the Danish Society was originally founded in 1908,
so that it is already well established. We are sorry if- our
words conveyed a wrong impression, and take this opportunity
of making the matter clear.
PROFESSOR RICHET AND THE ACADtiMIE DES SCIENCES.
AT a meeting of the French Academic des Sciences on the 13th
of February last, Professor Richet brought forward his recently
published book Traite de Metapsychique. He addressed the
meeting thus :
This work is an exposition of certain experiences and observa-
tions which I have tried to classify methodically. It seemed to
me that the unregulated and strange phenomena observed by
honest and careful investigators, some of them well-known men,
such as Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Zollner, and
William James, ought to be subjected to a thorough enquiry, and
not received with sarcasm or disdainful silence.
256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1922.
The word metapsychic, which I created to designate this science
of hidden things, a word which now seems to be generally accepted,
indicates that these phenomena are of a psychological order, but
they extend beyond ordinary, classical psychology and immensely
increase the field of human intelligence.
. . .
Strange as the facts which I describe may seem to be,
they do not contradict any accepted scientific truths. They are
new ; they are unusual ; they are difficult to classify ;
but they
do not demolish anything of what has been so laboriously built
up in our classic edifice. If people dispute them a priori, it is
because they have not sufiiciently reflected on the profound
difference which separates the unusual from the contradictory.
I have therefore the right to ask that people should read my
book before they judge it. ...
The event recorded above is noteworthy in that this is
the first time that the Academic des Sciences has accorded
official recognition to such a book as Professor Kichet's. "VVe
hope to review this book shortly in the Proceedings.
HYPNOPOMPIC PICTURES.
(EDITORIAL NOTE. We print below an interesting account
sent to us by Mr. M. Gheury de Bray, F.R.A.S., of his experi-
ence of hypnopompic illusions. With Mr. de Bray's report
may be compared the statements published in Phantasms of
the Living,Jp. 474.)
BA CURIOUS SUBCONSCIOUS MANIFESTATION.

has repeatedly] arrived to me, lying awake, after sleep,
with eyes shut, to become suddenly aware that / see very
distinctly in detail, things pictured independently of any
volition whatever. I am sufficiently wide awake to realize
that I am in a conscious state, and this is a most interesting
manifestation, to attempt to influence it by acts of volition,
to note its gradual disappearance, etc. . . . Yet the state is
entirely beyond my volition, except perhaps that I could end
it by opening my eyes ;
I have not tried this, as I naturally
tried to continue it as long as possible.
Invariably, the pictures are a moving landscape as one sees
from a quickly moving vehicle, train or fast river steamer.
APRIL, 1922. Hypnopompic -Pictures. 257
A whole panorama defiles before the eyes, in all its details,
just perceived, but (exactly as if seen from a train, etc.)
without leaving time to see the details, being gone as soon
as perceived. I believe that the scenery always passes from
left to right but now that I think of it, I am not quite
sure, fore-ground swiftly . . .
back-ground slowly . . . there
no break of continuity, yet one scenery will succeed another,
quite different, with quite a natural transition. In that
state repeatedly I have " willed
"
to see appear a tree, a
mountain, a rock, the sea, etc. . . . and watched for their
appearance ;
either they come, or they come not, but if
they
come, they might just as well have come if I had not
"
willed
"
them to. If I
"
willed
"
an unlikely thing, it did not come.
The first time that I noticed this, I was at sea, awakening
after my watch below. It was about 1900. Since, I have had
this occur about half a dozen times. It begins with the
sudden realization that
"
there is that thing again !
"
It
probably gradually shaped itself, but I have not so far realized
that it was beginning and watched its formation. Only
the last time (last night, in fact) do I remember how it ended.
In this particular case it faded gradually, like a fading view
the magic lantern, the motion stopping gradually as it
Led, till it remained but a motionless vague undelineated
thing which I could not describe, except as something seen
in a mist. This refers to this one case only, the others were
not noticed or forgotten.
In this one case, I
"
jumped to attention
"
at the realization
that
"
there it was again," to see the swift left to right
moving panorama of ordinary agricultural land, with cottages,
etc. ... I willed a tree, and surely enough one came, (it
would have come also probably by itself without volition on
my part), I thought of spring and the fruit blossoms, and
the landscape whitened a little afterwards with the snowy
orchards I had imagined. I
"
willed
"
mountains, and the
flat country began to break up, became hilly, and after some
ten seconds, came distant vistas of mountains. I
"
willed
"
rocks, but none came distinctly enough to be recognizable,
but the thing was getting blurred ... I thought of the sea ...
but things became more blurred and at a standstill, and
remained but a featureless steady thing, made up of a succes-

sion of little bright patches close together, with distant
marginal indistinct things . . . like a shore at low tide, with
the imprint of the waves on the sand, catching the rays of
the sun, the whole seen through a mist . . . this faded very
slowly.
I may add that I never see visions, have only had once
a very curious hallucination, and am trained in most minute
and delicate scientific observations.
CORRESPONDENCE.
I. ON "
THE CASE OF ABRAHAM FLORENTINE."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL or THE S.P.R.
MADAM, For more than two years I have been examining the
automatic writing and seance records of Stainton Moses in the
original script and preparing an account of my researches which
will soon be published. In this connection I wrote last summer
to the Secretary of the S.P.R. suggesting that an enquiry should
be made in the United States as to whether any obituary notice
of Abraham Florentine appeared in the American papers and
might conceivably have formed the basis of the communications
ascribed to his spirit. The Secretary kindly took steps to carry
out my suggestion and informed me of the result. I did not
.
anticipate the publication of the enquiring officer's report without
reference to me and the sequel of a correspondence in the Journal
on the merits of the case. As my name was not mentioned
in the November issue, which contained the report, several persons
who know of the researches in which I am engaged have drawn
my attention to the correspondence without realising that the
enquiry was made at my instance. There may be others who
are surprised at my silence but have not mentioned the subject
to me. With all due deference I feel that some of the con-
clusions expressed in the November issue are hardly justified by
the ascertained facts, that the views of your correspondents might
be modified in the light of a full knowledge of the unpublished
records, and that even if the obituary notice served as the basis
of the communications the hypothesis of cryptomnesia does not
cover all the ground. I cannot go further into details without
forestalling what will soon be published and without requiring

too much space in your columns, for this case cannot be con-
sidered adequately as a single problem, it must be regarded as
one of a series. A. W. TRETHEWY.
II. ON "
AN EXPERIMENT IN FAKING
'
SPIRIT
'
PHOTOGRAPHS."
(EDITORIAL NOTE. In the Journal for February last, pp. 219-
223, we printed an account by the Hon. Everard Feilding of the
recent experiment in faking
"
spirit
"
photographs, carried out on
the initiative of Mr. James Douglas. We have received two
letters on the subject, which we print below together with a
reply from Mr. Feilding. We also print a statement from Mr.
William Marriott, who, having been shown the letters from our
two correspondents, has kindly consented to disclose the method
by which the trick was performed. Our thanks are due to Mr.
Marriott for thus
"
giving himself away
"
ior our benefit.)
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
(1) MADAM, Mr. Feilding's last sentence l
is noteworthy :
"
a
little foresight, some luck, and more bluff and you get an
extra."
One must concede that Mr. Hope must possess these qualities
to a superlative degree (if one can call
"
luck
"
a quality) con-
sidering that he has never been
"
caught out," in spite of in-
numerable tests with persons who were good amateur conjurers
and expert photographers.
For Mr. James Douglas was altogether too easy a prey for a
skilful conjurer like Mr. Marriott, highly strung, nervous and so
flustered that he signed the same plate twice, one signature over
the other, and packed and stowed away in an inner pocket his
opened packet of plates without being aware that he had done so.
I am glad that Mr. Feilding recognises that not much credence
<jan be attached to Mr. Marriott's statements as to how he
"
did
the trick," but I fear he has allowed himself to be bluffed on this
occasion when he asserts that it was not done either by the
substitution of slides or of plates.
But what I want to deprecate is all this attitude of secrecy
and mystery connected with so-called exposures of the methods
of faking
"
spirit
"
photographs.
Mr. Patrick and Mr. Whately Smith recently published a long
account of how photographs might be faked, but the only actual
a
Cp. S.P.fi. Journal, February, 1922, p. 223.
260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1922,
experiment was carried out under conditions as ludicrously unlike
conditions one can obtain with Mr. Hope, that it has no value.
Moreover, in spite of repeated requests, no prints of the results
have been published.
Here again in the Douglas-Marriott experiment, we are left
quite uncertain as to the real methods employed by Mr. Marriott.
Mr. Feilding states that it is quite easy to produce the
"
cloud
"
effects and clear faces seen in some of Mr. Hope's best
"
psychic
"
photographs. I have no doubt that this is correct, if a plate is
prepared beforehand and substituted in the dark room, but can
the effect be produced in any other way ? It is loosely stated
that it can be, but I have never heard of its being actually done
before competent and credible witnesses.
What seems to be required is that
"
extras," comparable to
Mr. Hope's best effects, should actually be produced by each of
the alleged processes seriatim, not secretly, but slowly and openly,
in the presence of a small Committee of expert photographers and
conjurers, each process being carefully noted and recorded, and
the results printed. It should then be considered theoretically
and practically whether these processes could be carried out
under the conditions obtaining at a Hope sitting without being
detected by a competent observer.
This would be scientific, and would be of great value in enabling
us to judge better as to the probability of Mr. Hope's phenomena
being genuine, while it would help the experimenter as to what
particularly to observe at a Hope sitting, and increase the value
of his record.
Surely we all want to get if possible to the truth in the matter
of so-called psychic photography, and there is more hope of
accomplishing this end by observation and experiment than by
slinging accusations against the
"
psychic
"
photographers.
C. E. BADDELEY, Colonel.
WALBOTTLE HALL,
NEWBURN-ON-TYNE.
(2) MADAM, May I be permitted to remark upon the article
in the Journal of the S.P.R. for February, 1922, entitled an
"
Experiment in Faking
'
Spirit
'
Photographs," as it would seem
that there are a few points that are open to criticism.
(1) In the last line on p. 219, these words occur, . . .
"working
under precisely the same conditions. . . ."
APRIL, ii>22.
Correspondence. 261
(2) In the 5th and 6th lines on p. 220, ..." that if any of
the observers noticed any departure from the prescribed con-
ditions, they should at once say so. . . ."
(3) On p. 221, in the 22nd line, ..." he (Mr. Marriott) said
he had only brought one slide. ..."
With reference to (1) it would seem that the conditions were
not precisely the same as those followed by Mr. Douglas, when
experimenting with Hope at Crewe ;
as on p. 221, line 24, we
are informed that at Mr. Marriott's invitation, all the Committee
were asked to go into the dark room to witness the method of"
filling the dark slide, etc.
It would be of interest to hear Mr. Marriott's real reason for
giving this invitation.
Regarding (2) it is unfortunate that no member of the Committee
raised the question (as they had authority to), as to whether this
invitation on Mr. Marriott's part was in order.
Had the invitation been refused by all, it seems possible that
Mr. Marriott might have refused to be searched after this visit to
the dark room, as he had already done, before the visit took
place.
The reason he gave in lines 3, 4, p. 221, for not being searched
applies equally to both periods of the experiment.
Perhaps Mr. Marriott will explain ! As to (3) it is stated in
ie detail report of the experiment published in the Sunday
Express of December llth, 1921, that, when Mr. Marriott was
asked . . .
"
if he had a second dark slide, he at once took one
out of his overcoat pocket. ..." This scarcely confirms his
statement, given in the S.P.R. article, on p. 221.
It is noticeable that nowhere in any report of the experiment,
as far as I am aware, does Mr. Marriott definitely state that he
did not substitute another dark slide for the original one. We
know, of course, that he tricked the Committee somehow but
it does not seem to me that we are getting one step nearer to
the truth, or otherwise, of psychic photography by rather implying
that Hope does not change his dark slides, but is still a man
possessing sufficient skill to hoodwink those who experiment' with
him in some other way.
Will Mr. Marriott certify that he did not change his dark slide
or bring with him more than one slide ?
Does Mr. Feilding mean by the last three lines of his article,
that Hope, by
"
a little foresight, some luck and more bluff," has
262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1022.
obtained the hundreds of supernormal effects on the sensitive plates
that have appeared at Crewe and elsewhere, when these plates
have been exposed in his presence ?
That it is possible to. imitate many of these curious effects on
plates is of course quite well known to anyone possessing a
small amount of photographic knowledge ;
there are, however,
many Hope results, that would, I think, baffle the cleverest
workers, because microscopic examination fails to find in these,
the evidence of the employment of normal human action, that
would appear in the imitator's productions.
It would be of much interest if Mr. Marriott would be good
enough to submit some of his
"
mystic cloud
"
effects for such an
examination, and comparison with the Hope results which they
are said to imitate. R. E. E. SPENCER.
(3) Reply from Mr. Feilding.
MADAM, I have submitted the letters from Colonel Baddeley
and Major Spencer, which you sent me, to Mr. Marriott, and I
now forward his reply. It will be appreciated that, as the trick
was not mine to give away, I could not write more specifically
in my former communication. As Mr. Marriott has now responded
so fully to the request made to him, there is little for me to add.
I must however point out that Colonel Baddeley is wrong in
saying that I had ever asserted that the trick was not done by
the substitution either of slides or of plates. What I did say
was that Mr. M'Kenzie was wrong in his belief that it was done
by substitution of slides. Concerning the clouds, I am not a
photographic expert, but I understand that Colonel Baddeley is
probably right in his view that a really good psychic effect can
only be got by preparation and subsequent substitution. I do
not think therefore the slow and open production of extras before
a Committee a proceeding that should fairly be imposed on those
who believe that spirit photography is fraudulent, as a condition
of the acceptance of their theory. It will be noted that Mr.
Marriott relies in the first instance on what I assume to be the
basic principle of all conjuring, misdirection, in order to gain an
opportunity to effect substitution, and it would only be where
this had failed that any dark-room expedient would at the last
moment be resorted to as a pis-aller.
In reply to Major Spencer's question, I specifically abstained
in my paper from drawing any inferences affecting Mr. Hope.
AI-KIL, 11122.
Correspondence.
J have only had two experiments with that gentleman, one of
which was 9 years ago, and do not consider myself qualified to
express an opinion. But I think myself safe in saying that Mr.
Patrick and Mr. Marriott have shown that with a suitable admix-
ture of foresight, luck and bluff, very respectable extras can,
without any help from
"
the other side," be concocted in what
appear to observers to be fraud-proof conditions, until the loop-
hole is actually revealed to them.
It seems to me now to rest with Mr. Hope, Mrs. Dean or
Mr. Vearncombe, to carry the controversy a stage further by
inviting their spiritual coadjutors to introduce conditions beyond
the powers of their earthly rival to imitate.
EVERARD FP:ILDING.
(4) Statement by Mr. William Marriott.
MADAM, Possibly the best reply I can make to Colonel
Baddeley's and Major Spencer's letters, is to describe as shortly
as possible some of the various methods which in my opinion are
employed by Hope, and then explain how I did the trick on
Mr. Douglas. Conjurers are not usually expected to give away
their tricks, but as my chief purpose is not to advertise myself
but seriously to contribute to the demolition of what I am con-
vinced is a pernicious and growing conspiracy of fraud, I can
offer no objection to the invitation addressed to me.
The chief methods of fraudulent spirit photography may be
summarised as follows :
1. The substitution of a dark slide containing prepared plates
for the one loaded by the sitter with his own plates.
2. The substitution of prepared plates for unprepared ones
before these are loaded in the dark slide.
3. The use of a pocket flash light apparatus for impressing an
unprepared plate after it has been placed in the dark slide.
4. The addition of extraneous chemical during the process of
development.
5. The use of pinholes in the fabric covering the dark-room
lamp.
6. The use of similar pinholes on the cloth used for focussing
the camera.
7. The placing of a negative or a positive in the camera in
front of the plate in such a position that the light passing through
it will produce an image more or less blurred.
264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 1922.
Each of these methods may be used in a variety of ways.
In fact, so subtle is their application that it is almost impossible
for any observer not specially trained to prevent one or the
other of them being employed.
It is, no doubt, to this constant change of method that the
spirit photographers owe their immunity from absolute exposure.
If the operator fails to find or to create an opportunity for
working one of his dodges, he merely does nothing at all. Th-e
spiritual
"
atmosphere
"
is not right,
"
conditions
"
are unfavour-
able, the
"
force
"
is weak ;
and he hopes for better luck next
time, and usually gets it.
Which method has been used in any particular case can only
be ascertained from a critical examination of the finished negative
(a print is of no use), and the procedure followed .at that parti-
cular sitting. It is, however, unfortunately a matter of constant
occurrence that sitters attach the account of one sitting to the
result obtained at another.
Now a careful examination of the photograph produced by
Hope for Mr. James Douglas convinced me that it was not the
result of a pill-box exposure, but due to the deliberate preparation
of the plate beforehand. This narrowed the reproduction to a
case of substitution. Mr. M'Kenzie jumped to the conclusion
that I had changed the dark slides. He was wrong as the follow-
ing account will show.
Let me first describe the dark room. The window at which
the slides are loaded is in the main wall of the building. The
ruby fabric is placed at the outside edge of this so that there
is a ledge some 15 inches in depth between the fabric and the
back of the bench. This bench is not on a level with the
window but some twelve inches below it. The result of this
arrangement is that the bench is in absolute darkness.
Mr. Douglas and I entered the dark room. He immediately
opened the packet of plates and placed one in the dark slide.
In doing this he quite unwittingly departed from his own pro-
cedure in his Hope sitting, a repetition of which I had hoped for,
but since to have drawn his attention to this would have made
him suspicious, I had to let it pass. But that plate had to be
got out of the slide. Now, there is in these Lancaster Cameras
a loose piece of blackened card which is used to separate the
plates. I conveniently lost this. To find it, would require the
turning up of the light. This necessitated the plate being taken
1922. Correspondence.
from the slide and returned to the packet which was lying on
the table outside its box. I apparently went to the other end
of the room to turn on the light and Mr. Douglas commenced
feeling for the card. As soon as his hands were occupied I placed
a packet of prepared plates on the bench and his in my pocket.
The cardboard was then conveniently found without it being
necessary to turn on the light and my prepared plates were
loaded by Mr. Douglas himself into the dark slide without
suspicion.
When I came out of the dark room my plans were near being
frustrated by Mr. M'Kenzie's accusation. I had to get rid of
the plates before I could allow myself to be searched. Just to
test Mr. M'Kenzie's and Sir Arthur's powers of observation, I
invited them all into the dark room. And when Mr. Douglas was
putting his second plate into the dark slide, I simply placed the
packet in my pocket into the open box.
The sitting over and myself searched without anything being
found, it was necessary for me to get hold of the packet which
Mr. Douglas now had in his pocket, as this contained twelve
plates and not eight as it should have done, four having been
used. I therefore casually asked him what he was going to do
with them. He in all innocence replied that they were of no
use to him and gave them to me. Thus all ended well.
I had a second dark slide with me. The camera was not my
own, I had hired it for the day and had to return it the same
evening. The two slides were unfortunately differently marked,
one having the Lancaster metal trade mark on it and the other
being plain. I therefore used the marked slide to hold sundry
screws and fittings which I had had to remove to make the
apparatus more manageable for this particular occasion.
The pill-box felt in my pocket was a flash-lamp apparatus,
which I had in readiness in case of accident. I had also four
other dodges ready up my sleeve.
Had my reading of the Hope method not come off, I should
still have been able to produce something, but the fairies would
have been lost.
I hope that this simple and, I trust, clear explanation will set
all doubts at rest. I can assure my readers that nothing hitherto
done by Hope cannot be repeated by myself under the same
conditions. I can, and will with pleasure give anyone sufficiently
interested a set of fool-proof conditions, conditions under which
266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL, 11)22.
I
unhesitatingly state I can NOT produce an extra. When Hope
succeeds in circumventing these, I will admit that the case demands
further investigation, but not till then.
Colonel Baddeley, I think, undervalues the articles in the
Psychic Research Quarterly by Mr. Patrick and Mr. Whately
Smith. It was an account not only of how photographs mifffit
be faked, but of how they were faked, and to the satisfaction
of critical, non-spiritistic, University beholders. Further, he is
wrong in saying that no prints of the results have been published.
Mr. Patrick has kindly supplied me with a couple of prints which
I have made into lantern slides and shown publicly in my lectures,
and I understand that lantern slides have been made and shown
by him of the rest.
As regards Major Spencer's statement that there are many Hope
results that would baffle imitation, I can only say that although
I have examined a large number of these photographs, I have so
far seen none that seem to me to carry on their face any evidence
of supernormal origin. If Major Spencer would be good enough
to lend me a few which appear to him to be of this character
I should be very grateful, and would at least do my best to
supply him with humanly produced imitations.

III. ON "
THE Modus Operandi IN SO-CALLED MEDIUMISTIC
TRANCE."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, In Lady Troubridge's interesting and suggestive paper
on
"
The Modus Operandi in so-called Mediumistic Trance," the
theory is
tentatively put forward that the Personal Controls may
be a deeper hypnotic level of Mrs. Leonard's trance. If this
were so, I gather from the Doris Fischer case, and especially
from Dr. Mitchell's paper on that case, S.P.R. Proceedings, Part 79,
page 59, that we should expect to find that Feda would know
nothing about material given through personal control, but that
the personal control would know all about the Feda material.
From the notes of my own sittings with Mrs. Leonard, I find
that not only are the personal controls aware of things given
through Feda ;
but that, on occasion, Feda shows knowledge of
personal control material. On September 22nd, 1921, a D.G.I.
personal control had been reminding me of a time in our lives
,
r.i!. Correspondence -!7
when our ordinary home life had been interrupted, spoiled. The
fact was that we had provided a home, for over a year, for a
lady mentally afflicted. Feda, returning for a moment to say
good-bye, at the conclusion of the personal control, remarked as
follows :
"
I've come back, Mr. Bill ... she remembers things
she can't get through Feda . . . one or two personal things,
shops, and things, and noosances about people whom she didn't
want." Showing, I think, clear knowledge of what had just been
said. May I add my own witness to that of Lady Troubridge,
as to the striking reproduction of quality and tone of voice, of
persons no longer in the body, that we get on these occasions.
W. S. IRVING.
IV. BLEEDING STIGMATA.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, With reference to Father Thurston's claim that the
above have never been experimentally produced reluctant as
I am to join issue with Father Thurston, especially on a subject
that he has given so much more attention to than I have myself,
I am nevertheless, in the interests of truth, obliged to support
Mr. Hubert Wales in his contrary contention, of which he furnishes
proof in his letter to the Journal for December, 1921.
The late Lord D., a well-known Catholic peer, told a sister
of mine, who told me, that when he was going over an hypnotic
hospital somewhere in France, the doctor who showed him over
stopped at one of the beds, and asked him to watch what would
happen. After presumably making some passes over the man
who was to be the subject of the experiment, the doctor said :
"
Vous etes le Christ
"
; upon which the man instantly assumed
the attitude of the Sacred Figure on the Cross and blood flowed
from the wounds as familiarly depicted.
Unfortunately both my sister and Lord D. have recently
died, but this story derives a certain corroboration from the
present Lord D., brother of the late peer, to whom I have
written on the subject.
He says :
"
My late brother told my wife many years ago
that he saw a patient in a hospital (she thinks in Paris), and
that this man when hypnotised stretched himself in the form
of a cross, but my wife cannot remember anything about the
blood flowing from wounds being mentioned. I am sorry I cannot
268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. APRIL. 1922.
give you any more information as my brother never mentioned
the subject to me."
It is, I think, evident that if the man had merely stretched
himself under hypnosis and assumed the rigid attitude of the
Crucified, the story would have been hardly worth telling ;
but I well remember how impressed my sister seemed to be with
Lord D.'s narrative of the wounds appearing
"
almost instantly
"
and the blood flowing from them, and how she impressed me.

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
Archives de Psychologic. No. 69-70 (May-Oct. 1921).
This chief contribution in this double number is a very fine
biographical study by Prof. Claparede of Theodore Flournoy the
great psychologist of Geneva who was the founder of the Archives,
the friend of William James, the author of that classical and
fascinating study of mediumship *Des Indes a la planete Mars
(1900), and one of the few psychologists of the first rank who was
from the first in cordial sympathy with Psychical Research and
the methods of our Society in approaching its problems. Flournoy's
adhesion to the cause of Psychical Research is recorded in the
Journal for November, 1896, in 1899 he was elected a Corre-
sponding Member of the Society, and this he remained till his
death in 1920. It is much to be regretted that the Society
never obtained his services as President ;
for he would without
doubt have contributed as much stimulus and suggestion to its
work as its other foreign Presidents, William James, Charles
Richet and Henri Bergson. As it is, it is only possible to refer
those interested to this admirable account of Flournoy's life and work
by his colleague, friend and relative, Prof. Claparede. The same
number contains also a brief discussion by Prof. Larguier des
Bancels of an obsession from which Pascal is said to have suffered,
together with the suggestion of a psycho-analytic interpretation.

MR. PRICE'S LIBRARY.
EARLY in the year Mr. Harry Price, a member of the Society,
offered to place on permanent loan in the Society's Rooms his
magnificent collection of books on magic and witchcraft. The
offer was gratefully accepted by the Council, and so through
his generosity Mr. Price has given the officers of the Society
the benefit of being able to consult what is generally considered
to be the most complete library of magical literature in Great
Britain, if not in Europe.
The library is strictly for reference purposes but, when the
catalogue is finished, as many of the volumes as possible will
be available for reference by Members and Associates, whilst
the rest books printed for restricted circulation only will be
MAT, 1922. Mr. Price's Library. 271
reserved for the officers of the Society for use in their investi-
gations.
It may be of interest to members to know something of the
contents of the collection. The bulk of the volumes consist
of works on magic in the sense of legerdemain and comprise
every well-known book published in this country and abroad.
Many of the older works are now practically unobtainable,
and even modern works of this kind are so carefully guarded
that they soon go out of print, and not being sold in the
usual way escape the notice of bibliographers. Among some
of the rarer books we would mention firstly a fine copy of
Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft, first edition from the Yatton
Court Library together with all the subsequent editions. There
is also a tall copy of the 1581 edition of Bodin's De Magorum
Demonomania ;
a complete set of the rare Conjuror's Magazine
with all the plates printed in 1792-1793 ;
a number of the
rare chap-books and small popular volumes published in
London in the eighteenth century ;
a set of pamphlets on the
amazing case of Mary Tofts, the rabbit breeder, and a great
number of similar items on impostors of all ages and all
times. The section on stage telepathy is especially rich,
and there are works on codes from 1533 to the present day.
In MSS. the collection is well known for the inclusion of a
Burmese MS. on the work of the Indian fakirs which was
transcribed by Sir Richard Burton and also for smaller MSS.
on magic and astrology. Taken together, the books number
about fifteen hundred items, and when the list is complete
it will be available for consultation by members on application
to the Secretary.
Not content with loaning the above collection to the Society,
[r. Price has also offered to loan his photographic material
>r use in experimental work. This comprises about two
mndred and fifty pounds' worth of photographic apparatus,
icluding everything necessary for work in this field.
A CASE OF FEAUD WITH THE CREWE CIRCLE.
the last number of the Journal it will be remembered
it a discussion upon faking spirit photographs was initiated
272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1922.
by Col. Baddeley and Major Spencer, arising out of an experi-
ment conducted by Mr. William Marriott. The controversy
revolved around the alleged mediumship of Mr. William Hope
of Crewe, and in speaking of him Col. Baddeley remarked that
"
he has never been
'
caught out,' in spite of innumerable tests
with persons who were good amateur conjurers and expert
photographers." It may not be known to members generally,
that the officers of the Society have for some considerable
time been endeavouring to persuade Mr. Hope to allow his
mediumship to be tested by a competent committee. The
present Research Officer has done his utmost since his appoint-
ment to persuade Mr. Hope and his advisers to allow him to
have some sittings under almost any conditions, but without
avail. Fortunately, however, we have been able to avail
ourselves of certain investigations by persons whose qualifi-
cations were partly unknown to the medium and his advisers.
We print below a report from one of these investigators,
dealing with the medium Hope ;
the writer of this report,
Mr. Harry Price, is a Member of the Society, and combines
a wide experience of photographic processes with an extensive
acquaintance with deceptive methods and contrivances. At one
time he was Hon. Librarian of the Magicians' Club, London,
and is also a member of the Society of American Magicians.
The Society possesses two
"
spirit
"
photographs taken by Mr.
Price twenty-two years ago, which indicate that the writer
possesses some qualifications for the experiment described
below.
About 1915 Mr. Price applied to Mr. William Hope for a
sitting, but received no reply. On March 10, 1921, he applied
again, but met with a similar result. On November 11, 1921,
he called at the British College of Psychic Science, with a
letter of introduction from the Librarian of the London
Spiritualist Alliance (of which organisation he is a member),
and saw the Hon. Secretary, Mrs. B. M'Kenzie, who promised
to try to arrange a sitting.
On January 12, 1922, he received the following letter from
the College :
DEAR MR. PRICE, I enclose particulars of an experiment offered
you with the
"
Crewe Circle."
MAY, 1922. A Case of Fraiid with the Crewe Circle. 273
If you decide to take this, kindly confirm as soon as possible.
The fee for non-members is 2 2s. Od., to be paid on confirmation.
You should provide a half-dozen packet of plates for the experi-
ment, Imperial, or Wellington Wards are considered preferable.
Mr. Hope gives every opportunity to the sitter during the
experiment, but he will not undertake tests and will use his own
camera.
Nothing is guaranteed but good results can be assisted by
sitters keeping the plates in their environment for a few days.
If you wish you are at liberty to bring a friend to share the
sitting if they are sympathetic, for the one fee.
E. FORD,
Ass. Secy.
Appointment.
Friday, Jan. 27th, 10.30 a.m.
On January 21, 1922, a letter was received from the College,
saying that owing to illness the Crewe Circle would have to
transfer the appointment to February 3, which date was again
cancelled in favour of February 24, at 10.30 a.m.
Meanwhile Mr. Price had been considering what steps were
advisable in order to make sure that the results, if
any,
should be genuine. Accordingly, on January 25, he visited the
works of the Imperial Dry Plate Co., Ltd., at Cricklewood,
and discussed the whole matter with the Secretary. In
writing to Miss Newton the same night, he says :
I have spent the morning at the works of the Imperial Dry
Plate Co., Ltd., Cricklewood, discussing and trying out various
tests by which we can invisibly mark the plates which will be
handed to Hope. We have decided as the best method that the
plates shall be exposed to the X-rays, with a leaden figure of a
lion rampant (the trade mark of the Imperial Co.) intervening.
The centres of each set of four plates will be treated, so that
when the plates are placed in their proper order, the full design
will be seen. This is to safeguard against the allegation that some
of the plates may have been missed in the marking.
Any plate developed will reveal a quarter of the design, besides
any photograph or
"
extra
"
that may be on the plate. This
will show us absolutely whether the plates have been substituted.
I am also thinking out other safeguards that may help us.
A2
274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.
The Imperial Plate Co., writing three days later, confirms
the experiments made at their works, and in forwarding a
box of six prepared plates writes :
We are sending to-day under separate cover the box of our
Flashlight plates, quarter-plate size, bearing batch No. 14400 G.
These 6 plates have been specially dealt with by us, and have
been put through an exposure for a small portion of each under
our X-ray apparatus, so that when the plates are developed parts
of the design of our rampant lion trade mark will appear upon
each of them.
Four of the plates when put together will complete the whole
design, whilst the other two will only form a portion of the
design, whilst we have the remaining two to complete the figure
in our possession, which we are retaining until you communicate
with us again.
We have tested this method and find it to be quite infallible,
and it is impossible for anyone to have adopted the same steps
which we have with regard to these 6 plates, and therefore it
would be quite impossible for anyone to have effected any ex-
change of plates for the method you have under consideration.
In due course the plates arrived, and Mr. Price immediately
handed them in their original postal packings to Mr. H. J.
Moger of Pulborough, Sussex, who, in turn, sealed them
privately and forwarded them to the Secretary of the Society
for Psychical Research, for safe keeping. In this condition
they were kept until handed to Hope in the seance room at
the British College of Psychic Science.
Another point which occupied Mr. Price's attention was the
choice of a suitable companion to assist him during the sitting.
Acting on the advice of the Research Officer, he asked Mr.
James Seymour to accompany him ;
this gentleman, by a
happy concatenation of circumstances, combining precisely that
knowledge of photography and trickery so essential for an
experiment of this kind. On the morning fixed for the sitting
the Research Officer met Mr. Price and his companion at
Holland Park Station, and handed over the sealed packet of
plates for use in the experiment. After it was over, both
investigators immediately proceeded to the Rooms of the S.P.R.,
where a report of the sitting was dictated to a stenographer,
MAY, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 275
in the presence of both the Secretary and the Research Officer.
The following is a connected narrative of what occurred during
the time that Mr. Price and Mr. Seymour were at the College
for the experiment. It is derived entirely from the verbatim
dictated report taken down within forty-five minutes from the
conclusion of the sitting.
MR. PRICE'S REPORT OF HIS SITTING.
WE got to the B.C.P.S. at 10.25 a.m., and the door was opened
by a clerk. We took off our coats and walked into the reception
room where Mrs. M'Kenzie was waiting for us. We had a very
pleasant conversation with her, and we were very cheerful and
did all we could to impress her with the fact that we had come
to Mr. Hope in a friendly manner and would put no obstacle
in his way. We were escorted up to the top floor, and walked
into the well-lighted studio, when Mrs. Buxton came in and was
introduced by Mrs. M'Kenzie. I made myself extremely pleasant ;
said how sorry I was that they had been ill with influenza, and
asked after the Crewe Circle, saying that my people were natives
of Shropshire. I ingratiated myself with them in every way.
Afterwards, Mrs. Buxton seemed particularly friendly. Just at
that period Mrs. M'Kenzie left us, and Mr. Hope walked in from
the room outside on the left. I repeated my solicitations after
his health and made myself extremely affable to him. He also
seemed very pleasant and friendly. He asked me whether I had
ever done any photography. I said I used to do quite a lot
some years ago as I did. The plates had been on the table
during the whole of the conversation and were in the original
Imperial postal wrappers as sent to me at Pulborough.
Mr. Hope then asked us to sit round the table. We sat at
a small table, Mrs. Buxton facing me, Mr. Seymour on my right,
and Mr. Hope on my left. I noticed Mrs. Buxton eyeing the
packet with the outer wrappers very considerably, because appar-
ently she was not used to having plates brought like that. Mr.
Hope then asked me to undo the postal packet, which I did,
and I cut the string in two places, and threw the postal wrappers
on the floor, placing the unopened packet of plates on the table.
Mr. Hope then picked up the packet of plates and started
examining them. Then Mrs. Buxton said,
"
They are flash-light."
I said,
"
I told the Imperial people that they were for portraiture
276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1922.
inside a London room, and they suggested flash-light." Then Mr.
Hope examined the packet and he then handed it to Mrs. Buxton,
who again examined the packet very minutely I could see her
eyeing the packet. In my opinion, at that juncture they came
to the conclusion that the packet had not been tampered with,
because at that momemt Mrs. Buxton asked me whether the
packet had been opened. I said,
"
It is exactly as I got it from
the makers, outer wrapper and all
"
I was careful to say that.
Mrs. Buxton then examined it to find the speed number, as
Mr. Hope apparently could not see it.
Suddenly Mrs. Buxton
said,
"
Here is the speed number, it is 400 on the packet," and
Mr. Hope said,
"
Oh, yes, that will be all right."
[Mr. Seymour here interpolated :
"
Mr. Hope said he had not
worked with flash-light plates before, and thought they would
be quite all right and not hamper the experiment. They were
thoroughly taken in by the packet and were not suspicious of it."]
Mr. Hope then pushed the plates into the middle of the table,
and said,
"
We will have a hymn," and asked me whether I had
any particular choice of hymns. I said,
"
I know all the old
ones I should like
'
Onward Christian Soldiers.'
"
Mr. Hope looked at Mrs. Buxton and said,
"
Could you manage
'
Onward Christian Soldiers
'
?
"
She hesitated, and so, as I saw
the hesitation, I said,
"
Any familiar hymn will do." So Mr.
Hope then said,
"
How about
'
Nearer my God to Thee
'
?
"
I then placed my hands flat on the table; Mr. Hope's right
hand was on my left, and my other hand was over Mr. Seymour's
on my right, and Mr. Seymour's other hand was on Mrs. Buxton's
we were simply linked up. Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton's hands
were not linked during the whole of the time. Mrs. Buxton then
sang several verses six or seven of
"
Nearer my God to Thee,"
in a tune with which I was unfamiliar and did not recognise.
I did, however, join in where and how I could.
After the hymn Mr. Hope gave a long impromptu prayer, in
which he thanked God for all our many mercies, and hoped He
would continue His blessings up to the present moment. He
also craved blessings on our fellow-creatures and friends on the
other side, and asked assistance in the attempt to link up with
them, etc. etc. Then Mrs. Buxton sang another hymn, and then
Mr. Hope picked up the packet of plates from the centre of the
table and put them between Mrs. Buxton's hands ;
then he put
MAT, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 277
his hands on hers, I put my hands on his, and Mr. Seymour came
last of all, making a pile of hands with the packet of plates in
the centre. Then we had another short impromptu prayer by Mrs.
Buxton. Then the Lord's Prayer was sung, and a short hymn
concluded the service.
Mr. Hope now asked me whether I would like to sit by myself,
or whether I would like Mr. Seymour to sit with me. Of course
I said I would like to sit by myself, and Mr. Seymour made the
remark that as it was my sitting he would prefer that I should
sit by myself.
[Mr. Seymour here interpolated : "It would not have helped
me to sit with him, and to be alone gave me freer movement."]
Then the plates were left on the table ;
I stood up, and Mr.
Hope went into the dark-room, and brought his dark-slide to the
door to show me. He opened it out, saying,
"
These shutters pull
out like this, etc." (it was an ordinary double dark-slide), and
said,
"
This piece of black card in between is to separate the
plates." He handed the dark-slide to me to examine, and I
marked it indelibly twice on both sides (twelve marks in all),
and then I handed it back to Mr. Hope. He said,
"
You see
there is no film in here ;
some people think I put films in and
do the trick that way," and I said,
"
However could they think
such a thing, it is absurd !
"
He then came into the room,
picked up the packet of plates, which were then on the table,
and invited me to go with him into the dark-room. I was
about to ask that Mr. Seymour should come with me, when he
took the words out of my mouth by asking Mr. Seymour to sit
down at the table with Mrs. Buxton, and keep his hands on it
all the time, so as to
"
maintain the influence." After the
sitting was over, he said to Mr. Seymour,
"
You could have come
in the dark-room, if you had liked."
At the entrance to the door he asked me whether I would
open the packet of plates. While I was feeling for my knife,
he pulled out a knife and opened the packet himself. He then
made a remark to Mrs. Buxton to look after Mr. Seymour, while
we were in the dark-room, after which he closed the dark-room
door. He then handed me the dark-slide again, and also handed
me the opened packet of plates. He then said,
"
I will not
touch the plates, as I don't want you to think there is any
trickery. Do exactly as I tell you, I will not put a finger on
278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.
the plates." He then said, "Now which two will you have, some
take one and two, some one and three, some three and four.
Will you take the 1st and 3rd ?
"
I said,
"
I will take the 1st
and 2nd." He said, "All right, it does not matter; some have
one and some have the other."
I then opened the packet of plates in the dark-room, and I took
the first two out of the original wrapper. They had not left
my hands, but he touched my hand and turned it to a certain
angle, saying,
"
I must see that they go in the right side up
"
(which was quite a natural proceeding). The box containing the
other plates were in my hand the whole time. He said,
"
Now
do exactly as I tell you. Take the first plate and put it in this
recess." He said,
"
Now I will put the black paper card over
it," which he had retained the whole time.
"
Now will you put
the next one on top, exactly coinciding with the other one ?
"
We had some trouble in closing the dark-slide ;
at last, with his
nail, he moved the plate a fraction and so closed the slide, which
I took. All this was done under the red window, which I noticed,
directly I stepped into the room, was a graduated light, darker
at the top. We were close up under that window. He then
took the dark slide from me, saying at the same time,
"
Will
you do up the packet of plates again, as we may want them
later ?
"
I said,
"
Yes, I will," and did so ;
but my eyes never
left that dark-slide or his hands, although I was doing up the
packet, and I saw him as he backed, giving a half turn, two or
three paces from the light put the dark-slide to his left breast
pocket, and take it out again [another one ?], without any
"
talking
"
or knocking. He said,
"
Have you finished ?
"
I said,
"
Yes." He then said,
"
Will you put the packet of plates into
your pocket so as I cannot touch them." I said,
"
Yes." We
got to the door ;
he was just going to open it, when he said :
"
Would you like to mark the plates and write your initials on
them ?
"
I said,
"
I don't think it matters ;
would you advise
it ?
"
and he said,
"
Oh, well, some do it ;
some do not." I said,
"
I don't think I will in this case," and he said,
"
All right, if
you are satisfied, I am." He then handed me back the dark-
slide, after I said I would not write my initials on the plates,
and we walked into the studio.
[Mr. Seymour said he was doing nothing at all while waiting
with Mrs. Buxton.]
M,\Y, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 279
Directly we entered the studio, I, thinking he would want the
slide at once, pulled it out of my pocket. The excuse I made
was that I thought he wanted the slide, but in reality it was to
see whether my marks were on it. They were not. But Mr.
Hope said,
"
Put them (the plates) back in your pocket, as there
is such a bright light in here, it will fog the plates." He then
;i*!'d me to sit down on the chair. He then said,
"
This is an
old Lancaster camera, given to me by Archdeacon Colley," and
I remarked,
"
It must be a curio." He started focussing the
camera, and asked Mr. Seymour to come over and focus it too.
Mrs. Buxton then asked me to get into position and keep still.
Mrs. Buxton then came over and asked for the dark-slide and
handed it to Hope. He then drew the shutter of the dark-slide,
and threw the focussing cloth over it and the lens of the camera,
making a cap of it. He said,
"
Please be still." I was looking
full at the camera. Mr. Hope then pulled up the dark cloth
from off the lens, and during the exposure he gave I counted in
my mind,
"
1 and 2 and 3 and.
"
etc., and counted in that way
up to nineteen (seconds). It was an abnormally long exposure
for plates of 400 H. and D. He then threw the dark cloth over
the lens again, and Mrs. Buxton said to Mr. Hope,
"
Is that
No. 1 or No. 2 ?
"
He said,
"
That is No. 1." Mrs. Buxton
then said to me,
"
Will you kindly take a slightly different
position for No. 2 ?
"
and I turned my head to the right, evidently
too far round for their idea, and they told me to turn it to the
left a little, and would I look at Mrs. Buxton. This I did.
They changed the dark-slide round and withdrew the second
shutter and exposed another plate, and gave as long an exposure
as before I counted up to
"
18 and." While the exposures
were going on, Mrs. Buxton and Mr. Hope buried their heads in
the sides of the focussing cloth, as though in prayer, and kept con-
tact with the camera.
They then closed the dark slide up and took it out of the
camera, and immediately handed it to me again. I then put it
in my pocket. Mr. Hope turned to Mr. Seymour and said,
"
You
understand photography ?
"
Mr. Seymour said,
"
Yes." Then
he turned to me and said,
"
You can develop it if
you like
(referring to both of us), and I said,
"
I will develop it." We
three then went into the dark-room with the slide in my pocket.
Mr. Hope then started mixing some developer into a glass measure ;
280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.
brought me a rather dirty (stained with silver stains at the
bottom) porcelain dish which just held the two quarter-plates,
which were developed together. Mr. Hope took the dark-slide
out of my hand and opened it. He then said,
"
Hold out your
hands and I will tip the plates on to your hands so that I do
not touch them." He did so. I then put the plates in the
porcelain dish myself, and Mr. Hope poured the developer over
them, and to my surprise, instead of the plates flashing up black
at once, as it seemed they ought to have done had they been
those I brought with me, the plates developed slowly (as ordinary
slow plates would do).
During the period the plates were developing, we were talking
upon various subjects, about photos Hope had taken ;
and he
told us that last week he had to take ten plates before he got
an
"
extra
"
on one. Naturally, I was very anxious, and I kept
on looking to see the Imperial Co.'s trade mark come up at the
corner of the plates ; not a sign of it. On the other hand I
noticed that there was an
"
extra
"
forming on one of the nega-
tives. I then took the dish and examined the plates more
closely at the red electric light, and he said,
"
Don't put it too
near or you will fog them, as I did so last week," and he said
he had spoken to Mr. M'Kenzie about this light, and he (Mr.
M'Kenzie) had not done anything yet. I then looked at the
plates again, and I saw that the trade mark of the Imperial
Plate Co. was not coming up on the plates, and that there was
an " extra
"
on No. 2 negative. I cried out,
"
I am so glad we
have an
'
extra
'
on here, thank you very much indeed." I
then asked him whether they were done, and he then had a look.
We waited a few minutes longer and he said,
"
Take them out
of the developer. Mind the step, and put them in the large
dish of hypo, which is up there, and do not put them on top
of each other." I took them out of the developer and put
them in the hypo. We then went into the studio again
where Mrs. Buxton was awaiting us. I told Mrs. Buxton
that what I had come for had been very successful, and
thanked her very much for her help and that of Mr. Hope.
Then Mr. Hope went out of the room for a few minutes,
and I then asked Mrs. Buxton whether I could take the other
negative away with me, as I fancied it was a good portrait
of me. Mrs. Buxton thought they had no objection at all. She
MAY, 1922. A Case of Fraud with the Crewe Circle. 281
said,
"
What will you put it in ? I will try and find a box when
Mr. Hope comes in." Mrs. Buxton then went into the dark-room
and had. a look at the negatives, brought out the one I wanted
not the one with the
"
extra
"
on and gave it to me. I said
I could take it all right. Then she went into the dark-room
again, and brought out the negative with the
"
extra
"
on, and
I was highly delighted to see a charming female form looking
over one of my shoulders. I said I wondered whether this was
my mother, and Mr. Seymour said,
"
Surely your mother would
be older than that."
"
My mother died at the age of forty-one,"
I said. Mrs. Buxton said,
"
This is a very good one indeed."
I said,
"
How many prints can I have ?
"
She said,
"
Mrs.
M'Kenzie arranges all those matters. Will you see her ?
"
At
that moment Mr. Hope came in again and showed me a letter
he had recently received from Glasgow, where one of his sitters
had recognised a relative. I then once more thanked Mr. Hope
for the great service he had been to us that morning. Mr. Hope
said that he thought the result was very successful and that he
was usually at his best early in the morning, and that accounted
for a very successful
"
extra." I said if I happened to be near
Crewe I should like to call on him, and he said
"
Do, and we
will fix up a sitting with you, but let me know a little before-
hand." I took my negative away ; shook hands with them both ;
saw Mrs. M'Kenzie ;
thanked her and told her it had been very
successful, and asked her if I could have a dozen photographs.
She said,
"
You are entitled to two," and so I offered to pay
for the other ten, which she said would be 6d. each. I gave her
a 1 note, and she went into the office and brought me back
the change. We left the college at 11.20 a.m.
[Mr. Seymour is in substantial agreement with everything that
Mr. Price has said concerning the part that he played in the
sitting.]
[Signed] HARRY PRICE.
The same afternoon, Mr. Price, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Ding-
wall went to the studio of Keginald Haines, in Southampton
Row, where the remainder of the plates were developed at
3.5 p.m. by an operator of Mr. Haines' under supervision. On
each of the four plates the section of the Imperial Co.'s trade
mark came up clearly, thus showing what part of the design
282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, MAT, 1922.
Hope had retained. The figures will, we hope, make the
matter clear.

Plate II. is taken from the negative brought back from the

of slightly different colour. It is one of the two plates substi-
tuted by Hope (as described above). Of the two original
plates retained by Hope one, as we have said, is now in our
possession, thus making only one blank in the complete set
of eight plates, including the two kept by the Imperial Dry
Plate Co., Ltd. (see their letter above), which they returned
for the purpose of discovering what portion of the design had
been retained by the medium.
In the above case, it can, we think, hardly be denied that
Mr. William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately sub-
stituting his own plates for those of a sitter. The move was
as good as seen to take place, and the supposition that it did
was abundantly confirmed both when the slide was examined,
and when the plates were developed. Presumably that substi-
tution was effected by the medium in order to obtain a plate
upon which an
"
extra
"
had already been impressed. If such
was the case (and we cannot conceive of any other reason
for substitution), it implies that the medium brings to the
sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent
purposes. Possibly he has other methods when substitution
is not possible. Possibly also these methods could be
detected as easily as substitution, were competent witnesses,
with adequate photographic and magical knowledge, permitted
to test the
"
phenomena
"
produced by Mr. Hope. Meanwhile
desiring in this matter to be scrupulously just we are
willing to publish in a later number of the Journal an
account of a sitting with Mr. Hope, in which any fraudulent
manipulation is considered to be ruled out, provided that the
evidence appears to us sufficiently good to merit scientific
consideration. Eeports submitted must be fully detailed, and
the sitters must give some evidence that they possess that
combination of photographic knowledge and acquaintance with
the principles of deception which is absolutely necessary for
such experiments.
NOTES ON RECENT PERIODICALS.
IN the January number of the Journal of the American Society
for Psychical Research, Dr. Walter Prince relates some of the
experiments that he took part in with the psychometric medium,
284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAT, 1922.
Senora Maria Reyes de Z. The discovery of Senora Z.'s remark-
able powers is due to Dr. Pagenstecher of Mexico City, in which
town the medium resides. A complete translation of all Dr.
Pagenstecher's experiments is in preparation, and will shortly be
available. The same number contains an account and exposure
of
"
Dr." Hugh Moore, a notorious American etherialising, trumpet
and slate-writing medium. The etherialisations were nothing
more than luminous cheese cloths dangled in front of the sitters,
who nevertheless recognised their friends and relatives. The
February number of the same Journal contains a posthumous
article by Dr. Hyslop on Psychic Phenomena and Christianity,
a review of the recent book by Millais Culpin, and also a notice
of the Wanderings of a Spiritualist, by Sir A. C. Doyle. Among
the Incidents is to be found an interesting account of apparent
communication by means of the Ouija board.
In the Revue Metapsychique for January-February Dr. Geley
continues his descriptions of the remarkable series of wax moulds
of human members obtained through the mediumship of Franek
Kluski. Those readers who are acquainted with the old paraffin
mould tests will find much to comment upon on inspecting the
really extraordinary examples illustrated. Dr. Geley prints the
opinion of the heads of the firm of Gabrielli, who support him
in his contention that the moulds could not be manufactured by
any known normal process. The same issue contains a short
article on
"
Un cas presume d'Ideoplastie pendant la gestation."
It appears that a cat living in a baker's shop in Nice shows upon
the fur on its belly the number 1921, the figures resembling those
printed upon the sacks in the shop. The strength of the evidence,
however, seems scarcely sufficient to bear the far-reaching theory
which the author bases upon it.
The February number of Psychische Studien prints the paper
read by Grunewald at the Psychical Research Congress on what
he terms ferro-magnetic phenomena amongst men. Wilhelm
Tordai contributes a survey of the alleged poltergeist phenomena
occurring at Kecskemet in Hungary, which have many points of
similarity with the manifestations said to have been occurring in
Nova Scotia, which have recently been investigated by the
American S.P.R. In the same issue Schwab continues his series
of papers on hallucinations, pseudo-hallucinations and clairvoyance,
whilst Dr. Lebrecht translates the' account of the clairvoyance

which is said to have been exercised by the medium Ossowiecki
at Warsaw and reported by Dr. Geley in the Revue Metapsychique
for Nov.-Dec., 1921.
The Hibbert Journal for April contains several articles likely to
be of interest to psychical researchers. Prof. J. S. Mackenzie
briefly examines Dr. Steiner's theories which are embodied in his
recently translated book, The Threefold State. Dr. Steiner is well
known, not only as a political theorist, but also as a student of
the occult, his Manual of Occult Science being one of the most
important of his contributions in that direction. In the present
article Professor Mackenzie does not deal with Dr. Steiner's occult
teaching, so that the following article on a case of being Pestered
by a Poltergeist is likely to have greater attractions for the
student of psychic phenomena. In this paper Mr. Nigel Kerr
describes the experiences of his wife and himself in a house in
Italy where both auditive and tactile phenomena were remarked.
The manifestations consisted mainly of footsteps at all hours
coupled with the opening of doors and the sensing of unseen
presences. Mr. Kerr tells his story in a convincing way, but it
is highly regrettable that the phenomena were not reported at
the time, so that some investigation might have been made. The
phenomena partake rather of the nature of haunting than of
poltergeist, the] latter term being usually restricted to those cases
where the manifestations consist of the breaking of crockery and
furniture, and such like disturbances. Mr. Kerr does not appear
to have made any direct experiments in order to determine the
real character of the noises heard in the house. After his
departure the house remained empty for some time, and then a
fresh couple moved in, who do not seem to have been disturbed
as yet by the phenomena which so distracted Mr. Kerr and his
wife.
The same number of the Hibbert contains an article by Mr.
W. R. Bousfield, in which he endeavours to point out to Mr. Edward
Clodd the errors of his reasoning. Although we congratulate
Mr. Bousfield on the attempt, we fear that Mr. Clodd will not be
found open to reason, the credulity of the latter being a barrier
which will prevent him understanding logical argument. It is,
however, amusing to find the weapons of the psycho-analysts
turned against themselves and the materialistic complex being
compared to the spiritualistic complex. We have pointed out
286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1022.
elsewhere how to the leading psycho-analytical practitioner in
Great Britain, Dr. Ernest Jones, a belief in telepathy presents itself
primarily as a derivative of the flatus complex, and Mr. Bousfield,
in quoting Dr. Jones's words rightly shows some impatience at
these ex cathedra utterances. Just as the spiritualist with
his complex refuses to discuss, or denies those facts which run
contrary to his beliefs, so does the modern psycho-analyst of
the extreme school, by virtue of his complex, refuse to discuss
those facts which, if true, are dangerous to his theories. Indeed,
it is really remarkable how, for instance, the whole of the litera-
ture concerning veridical dreams is passed over in silence, lest
some uncomfortable fact should emerge which may cast a doubt
upon the theory that every dream represents the fulfilment of an
egocentric wish. In the present article Mr. Bousfield examines
the more simple statements of Mr. Clodd, and describes some of
his own experiments in telepathy, concerning which we should like
to have further information.
The Occult Review for March contains a brief account of taran-
tism in Madagascar, which will be found of interest to those whose
studies have led them to a consideration of the various forms of
dancing mania found in different parts of world. Mr. J. W.
Brodie-Innes contributes a short survey of Miss Murray's theories
of witchcraft lately propounded in her Witch-Cult in Western
Europe, and Mr. H. S. Redgrove has something to say on the
subject of talismans and amulets. E. J. DINGWALL.

of a psychical laboratory should one ever be formed, yet up to
the present time few attempts have been made in the English
-
speaking countries to provide such a department for the purposes
of psychical research. Stanford University has a properly equipped
section for these researches, and a certain amount of experimental
work in telepathy has been carried out at Harvard by means of
a fund named in memory of Dr. Richard Hodgson. Apart from
these two institutions, the universities of America have done
practically nothing to encourage research in psychical phenomena,
and this cannot be surprising when we consider the superior
attitude adopted by the heads of the psychological departments.
In England the position is even worse. Neither Oxford nor
Cambridge has any facilities for research in this field, and although
the latter university has now excellent laboratories for experimental
psychology, psychical research is almost uniformly neglected. In
France the Metapsychical Institute, with its elaborate equipment,
supplies the needs of French investigators, whilst in Germany we
heard nothing of any serious laboratory work until the appearance
of this little book by Fritz Grunewald. The author describes his
own experimental rooms, and deals in broad outline with the
apparatus that he has devised for use with mediumistic subjects.
The book itself is divided into three main parts. The first deals
with mediums and general methods of investigation ;
the second
describes the laboratory ;
whilst the third illustrates the two
previous sections by giving a few practical examples of actual
investigations the author has undertaken. The laboratory itself
is divided into four sections, including a room which is used
principally as a workshop for constructing the apparatus. In the
principal room is placed the cabinet, a simple affair of black
curtains. The medium's chair of wicker work construction is
placed within the cabinet mounted upon a weighing board, which
is used for registering any variation in the weight of the medium.
This platform rests upon four spiral springs, which are compressed
when any load rests upon the board. The movements of the
platform make electrical connections, the results of which are
registered by a mirror galvanometer in another part of the room.
The deflections of the needle are further registered by means of a
beam of light which falls upon a strip of sensitised paper wound
upon a revolving drum forming part of the apparatus placed on
a table at the other end of the room opposite the cabinet. For
288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.
the purpose of weighing any materialised form extruded from the
medium a second weighing platform is provided, and this is placed
in front of the first. The registrations of this second platform
are also obtained by a mirror galvanometer, the curve being traced
directly beneath that furnished by the medium's platform for the
purposes of comparison.
For table phenomena Grunewald has constructed a special table,
rather after the model of Comte de Gasparin's. It consists of two
parts one, a three-legged round-shaped piece of wood screwed to
the floor, and the other standing freely upon the fixed base. This
latter consists of two circular wooden discs separated from each
other by three wooden rods, the whole structure including the
base being about sixty centimetres high. On the upper piece of
wood is placed a paper disc so arranged on a central pivot that
it is
easily movable. Along the edge of the paper disc are thirty
holes, from which hang threads which in turn are fastened to six
short wooden rods. The table itself is made for three experi-
menters only. When these are seated their knees are on a level
with the upper wooden disc, their feet being placed beneath the
base, which is of such diameter that the feet of the sitters touch
when they are sitting at the table. Each sitter now takes two
of the wooden rods hanging from the threads and places his hands
on his knees in such a way that they touch the hands of his
neighbour, and are thus controlled. With this table Grunewald
claims to have obtained both tipping and levitation phenomena,
but he does not give enough detail to enable the reader to follow
the various operations intelligently.
In the matter of light Grunewald appears to have made but
few experiments. During the greater part of his investigations
he employed the usual red illumination, and holds out but poor
hopes that ultra-violet
"
light
"
will ever be of much service in
psychical research. For raps the author makes use of an ingenious
piece of apparatus, which it may be of interest to the reader to
describe briefly. It consists essentially of a box closed on all
sides and surrounded by a practically sound proof shell which
prevents any normal noise outside from being heard within the
box. In the box are three microphones. Two are connected up
with two telephone instruments which a couple of the observers
hokTto their ears. The third microphone is connected to a vibra-
tion galvanometer, the luminous pointer of which is directed on
MAT, 1922. 289
to a photographic registering apparatus. A noise which originates
from within the box by means of psychic action is heard simul-
taneously by both listeners. Each on hearing the noise presses
an electric button and produces by means of a
"
writing magnet
"
a time mark on the paper strip of the registering apparatus.
The marks of both observers always fall together, thus furnishing
a criterion for the objective character of the noises which must
have originated within the box. At the same time the galvano-
meter records the vibration curve on the corresponding revolving
paper strip. The correspondence of the beginning of this curve
with the marks made by the two observers furnishes a further
proof of the objective factor. The "writing magnet" (Schreib-
magnet) mentioned above is a little piece of apparatus for which
Grunewald finds a multitude of uses. It comprises a tube which
is mounted on an adjustable arm springing from an upright rod.
Within the tube is a small electro-bar magnet, which, when excited
by an electric current, attracts and thus moves a keeper on which
is fastened a small mirror. A beam of light reflected from this
mirror, and thence on to a revolving drum of photographic paper,
can thus be made to act as a time recorder, the mere pressing
of a button being sufficient to cause deviation in the line traced
out on the moving sensitised paper strip.
Another interesting field of inquiry into which Grunewald has
penetrated a few steps is the investigation of mediumistic lights
by means of the spectroscope. His results are not yet complete
nor are his experiments on the chemical nature of these lights.
It is, however, remarkable that in the course of his investigations,
Grunewald constantly noticed the smell of phosphorus, which was
similarly noticed in the case of Stainton Moses and also, under
excellent conditions, with "Miss Burton. Further experiments in
this direction might yield valuable results, as also might an
investigation into the alleged magnetism of human subjects. The
author here details his own experiments in this direction with the
help of some rather complicated apparatus, and it would be desir-
able to check some of his results under varying conditions. The
main difficulty in all these investigations is the deplorable lack
of funds which holds up research in all the English-speaking
countries. In this intensely interesting book we have the methods
used and the results attained by one man who has had the sense
to see the extreme importance of instrumental assistance in
290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. MAY, 1922.
psychical research. Yet what this single investigator has been
able to do in his own laboratory and for his own satisfaction, the
English and American Societies for Psychical Research are unable
to do because the required financial assistance is not forthcoming.
It is hoped that the publication of this book will do something
towards furthering scientific methods in the observation and
investigation of alleged supernormal phenomena. The book
deserves a wide circulation, and although it is unlikely to have
any attractions for convinced spiritualists or materialists, it can
hardly fail to rouse the interest and enthusiasm of those whose
business it is to study in detail the physical phenomena of
spiritualism. E. J. DINGWALL.
CORRESPONDENCE.
I. ON "
THE Modus Operandi IN SO-CALLED MEDIUMISTIC
TRANCE."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, In the last issue of the Journal Mr. W. S. Irving
writes an interesting letter commenting upon the suggestion
tentatively put forward by me in my recent paper in Proceedings,
that the purporting Personal Controls occurring during Mrs.
Leonard's Trance might represent a deeper hypnotic level than
that which obtains during a Feda Control. He advances the
hypothesis based upon his study of The Doris Fischer Case and
of Doctor Mitchell's Paper thereon, that were this the case Feda
should be expected to know nothing of what occurs during a
Personal Control, whereas the Personal Control should have access
to all Feda material. This latter is, in my experience and that
of Miss RadclyfEe-Hall, invariably the case; and as regards the
example quoted by Mr. Irving of knowledge shown by Feda of
Personal Control utterances, I have not at this moment access to
the Doris Fischer Case, all my reference books being in storage;
but as far as my memory serves me, I do not think it was ever
really established that Margaret in that case constituted a deeper
hypnotic level than Sick Doris. Were there not indeed indications
to the contrary ? And yet upon occasion did not Margaret make
good her claim to knowledge of Sick Doris's experiences ? Be
this how it may, we might, I think, perhaps regard the very
occasional and fragmentary knowledge shown by Feda of the
MAY, 1922. Correspondence 291
Personal Control material as some unusual and momentary shifting
of the levels which gives Feda, for an instant only, access to
material which is generally outside her purview. My own experi-
ence is that the A.V.B. Personal Control (which in our present
Sitting occupies far the greater part of the trance), constantly
claims that she does so because she desires to mention to us
matters connected with personal affairs, or regarding other people,
or the medium's business, of which it is advisable that Feda
should remain in ignorance.
Might not the occasional knowledge shown by Feda of Personal
Control material be acquired by her telepathically or otherwise,
during the periods when she herself governs the organism ? She
might conceivably, for instance, while giving her own interpretations
of D.G.I.'s evidence, during the Feda part of the Sitting, have
received the impression regarding
"
People whom she didn't
want," and have been unable to voice it, while knowing that it
had been received by the medium's brain and would presently
emerge. Or again, during her brief return after the Personal
Control, she might possibly have found traces of the recently
uttered material lurking in the medium's mind. Mrs. Leonard
has told us that very occasionally she will find a fragmentary
memory of the recent Sitting recurring to her even after she *
has
resumed the normal state.
I am very glad that Mr. Irving has added his valuable testi-
mony to mine and that of Miss Radclyffe-Hall anent the personal
characteristics of the departed observable in the Leonard Personal

An answer from me is overdue to Colonel C. E. Baddeley,
who has raised some very interesting points in the March Journal
regarding my Paper. If I have delayed in replying, I feel sure
that Colonel Baddeley will forgive me, and accept my assurance
that my answer will be forthcoming very shortly. I must for
the purpose, however, await the unpacking of my reference books,
without which I cannot adequately deal with all that he has
said. UNA VINCENZO TROUBRIDGE.

an error which, unimportant in itself, appears to indicate that
one of the great classic studies of multiple personality, Dr. Morton

This is such a pity that I venture to point out to Col. Baddeley

OBITUARY: MR. H. ARTHUR SMITH.
At the moment of going to press we have learnt with much
regret of the death after a long illness of Mr. H. Arthur Smith.
Mr. Smith became a Member of the Society in December, 1882,
and was elected a Member of the Council in 1883. He was Hon.
Treasurer of the Society from 1886 to 1917, when he resigned for
reasons of health, and he was President in 1910. Mr. Smith took
a keen interest in the Society's welfare, and both as Treasurer
and in other ways he did much useful work. A more detailed
notice will appear later in Proceedings.

THE CASE OF MISS NANCY SINCLAIE.
EDITOEIAL NOTE.
The writer of the report which we print below has been for
several years a Member of the Society and is personally known
to some of the Society's officers. Since the lady who is the
subject of the experiments described in this report, here called Miss
Sinclair, does not wish for the present at any rate to disclose
her identity, it seemed best that the experimenter's name should
also be withheld, and he will be referred to here as Mr. T .
The case appears to be one of considerable interest to psychical
research and if the experiments can be continued, it should afford
an unusually good opportunity of studying various states of
mental dissociation and the supernormal phenomena which ap-
parently accompany them. It must be understood as Mr. T
himself clearly recognises that the present statement of the case
is only to be regarded as a preliminary report, indicating the
general nature of the case and of the phenomena which prima
facie characterise it. Some of these phenomena in particular
those described on pp. 321 ff. are of such a remarkable and
so far inexplicable nature that obviously no certain conclusions
can be drawn, until it has been found possible to repeat the ex-
periments. The difficulties which these experiments present and the
importance of conducting them in such a way as not to overstrain
Miss Sinclair will be apparent from Mr. T *s statement.
To whatever conclusions Mr. T or other observers may
finally come, the case undoubtedly presents abnormal features
well worth careful study, and as such we print it here.
It is only necessary to add that Mr. T - has shown himself
in other investigations which he has undertaken for the Society,
a careful and competent observer, and his bona fides, and that
of his wife, a witness to some of the phenomena, is to all who
know them

PART I. GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE CASE.
THE sensitive whose trance-phenomena I am about to describe,
and whom I will call Miss Nancy Sinclair, has been known

intimately to my wife and to myself for the past seven
years. She seems to have possessed her supernormal faculties
all her life, but has kept her knowledge of them so very
much to herself, that, until recently, no one suspected their
-existence.
All through her childhood, she says, she used to have
premonitions, flashes of spontaneous telepathy, and the faculty
of finding lost articles, and also occasional periods of analgesia,
but, growing up accustomed to these things, she does not
appear to have realised that other people did not have them
also. When she spoke of these things at home, the sisterly
ridicule which they evoked had the effect of making her
extremely reticent on these matters, and that is probably why
her gifts were not discovered until after the war. She did her
first piece of automatic writing at my wife's instigation in
November, 1919, with the result that she went into a light
stage of trance. After that she produced a small amount of
automatic writing in the normal state, the outcome of which
was a decision that she should make a serious attempt to
develop her powers by holding regular sittings under my 'super-
vision. These sittings were begun in February, 1921, but
were broken off for a period of six months at the end of
March, after which they were resumed in October, 1921, and
have been carried on with more or less regularity up to the
present time.
Miss Sinclair has never held sittings with anyone except
ourselves. She is not, and never has been, interested in
Spiritualism, and since she did not at first appreciate the point
of view of scientific psychical enquiry, I think we owe her a
great debt of gratitude for the time and trouble which she
has freely given to a work from which she had nothing to
gain, and which has often been distasteful to her. Moreover,
she has frequently had to put up with headaches, and other
physical disabilities which have resulted from over-strain, and
from unavoidable disturbances during trance.
It is hardly necessary for me to say that the idea of any
sort of conscious fraud on Miss Sinclair's part is absolutely
absurd to anyone who knows her. Also, from her own point
of view, it would be more to her interest to minimise rather
than to exaggerate her evidential material, so as to make out
A2
296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
that her powers were not after all worth developing, and there-
fore that she need not be bothered with them.
It is my purpose in the first part of this account to give
a general description of the types of evidential material which
Miss Sinclair produces, and of the various states in which she
produces them, and not to deal with the evidence itself except
in so far as that is necessary for descriptive purposes. In
the second part I have dealt with some of the evidential
material. Miss Sinclair's good faith does not, in the general
account, enter into the question except where her statements
about her subjective experiences are concerned, and it is
to be understood that the cases which I introduce in Part I.
are for illustrative purposes only, and it is not claimed that
they necessarily come up to the best evidential standards.
Miss Sinclair's psychical powers are as yet only partially
developed, owing to the short time during which she has held
regular sittings. Should she be able to continue the work,,
much fuller results should await us in the future.
I have put down the various states in which evidential
matter is produced, as far as possible in order of their departure
from the normal, but as far as I have been able to observe,
there is no clear line of demarcation between one state and
another, and in particular I have been struck by the imper-
ceptible gradation with which the normal condition passes into
that of light trance.
Telepathy.
I begin with the few trivial instances of telepathy which
have occurred, because the production of these does not appear
to involve any change from the normal state. It is to me a
matter of surprise that telepathy should be such a subordinate
feature in Miss Sinclair's evidential phenomena.
The few definite experiments I have tried have usually
proved failures, or partial failures, whereas the small successes
have been apparently accidental, and have occurred when her
mind was occupied with matters other than her psychical
work. The inference seems to be that it is essential for
success that the sensitive should not have in her mind the
knowledge that a telepathic experiment is being tried. The
JINK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 297
moment her attention is directed to this fact, she is unable
to prevent supraliminal guessing from displacing the slowly-
rising subliminal idea. Thus, I have often asked her to name
the object I was thinking of, but she has invariably failed.
I have also, on various occasions, tried to get telepathic
results during trance sittings for automatic writing, holding in
my hand a letter of the alphabet printed on a small card,
which I had previously looked at, and on which I was con-
centrating my attention. These experiments have all been
failures, as have also my attempts to influence telepathically
her crystal visions.
On the other hand, when the sensitive is engaged in the
ordinary occupations of life, telepathy seems sometimes to occur
spontaneously, although the very nature of the conditions
under which it occurs renders it impossible to estimate the
evidential value of each case.
Often when I come into the room where Miss Sinclair is,
to look for something, she fetches the object in question, and
hands it to me without a word having been spoken by either
of us. She once sent someone to find me in the garden,
telling them the exact spot where I was standing, a spot far
out of sight from the house.
The following is almost the only definite successful case of
telepathy which has occurred, if indeed it is not to be explained
by chance. (I am omitting cases which might be explained
clairvoyantly in view of the evidence for clairvoyance which
the present case has supplied.)
On Sunday, December 11, 1921, the rector of C -
spoke
to my wife outside the Church, and the same afternoon she
sent a note by post asking him to come to tea on the following
Tuesday or Wednesday. As there was no post out till Monday,
he could not get this note till Tuesday morning. At 2 p.m.
on Monday, December 12, 1921, Miss Sinclair wrote,
"
I think
the parson of C -
will come to tea to-day." He actually
came on Monday at 4.15 p.m., and it was ascertained that he
had not received the note. This case, it will be noticed, was
quite spontaneous.
"
Impressions"
A good deal of the evidential material which Miss Sinclair
298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1022.
lias produced lias risen to the surface of consciousness in the
form of
"
impressions." These impressions often occur when
she is in the normal state ; they rise up, and are spoken,
generally in rather a fragmentary way, as if
they were difficult
to capture and express. They vary both in form and intensity.
Sometimes they are merely vague warnings not to do something
or impulses to do something, but at other times they are
perfectly definite messages. Not infrequently they refer to
future events. I have reason to believe that impressions are
very frequently, if not almost continuously, making their way,
as it were, into the fringe of her supraliminal consciousness,
but most of them are too faint to attain expression. These
impressions are evidently very difficult to grasp ; they easily
slip away and are forgotten, and it is only the most vivid
which are finally translated into words. Eecently she has
succeeded in writing down some of her impressions, and I
think this writing down involves a slight departure from the
normal state of consciousness, for the slightest disturbance
during the writing will cause the remainder of the impression
to be lost. Also, the impressions once written, she immediately
forgets them, and even forgets the fact of having written them.
On more than one occasion, evidence has been spoilt owing to
this amnesia, Miss Sinclair having predicted in writing the
occurrence of some small event, and having omitted, or been
unable, to give me the paper on which it was written until
after the fulfilment of the event.
These impressions, however, are not written in a
state of trance. The handwriting is the sensitive's habi-
tual writing, and not the scrawl of the trance-script, but the
state in which they are written is, I think, bordering on
trance.
I will give an illustration of an impression which was in
itself very powerful, but in form no more than a vague
impulse, which occurred on April 22, 1921. Miss Sinclair had
just recovered from an illness. The impression took the form
of a warning bidding her not to go for a ride on her bicycle
on the following day. She was rather looking forward to
going out on her bicycle again, and, not wishing to be too
much governed by her impressions, she resisted the warning,
and went. The result was that she nearly collided with a
JIM:, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 291)
motor-lorry at a corner, and in avoiding it fell off the bicycle
and displaced her knee-cap.
A rather interesting instance of a similar impression occurred
on May 7, 1921. It was a Saturday, and we were packing
up to leave our house on the following Monday. Miss Sinclair
had come over the day before, and was to leave again on
Saturday by the 5.55 train. On her way to the station, she
became very undecided : she walked more and more slowly,
although there was barely time to catch the train, and told
me that she had an impulse bidding her to go back.
This case shows rather clearly the persuasive power of the
subliminal impulse, for Miss Sinclair was, as far as her supra-
liminal consciousness was concerned, obviously anxious to
continue her journey. There was no visible reason why she
should return, and in our half packed-up state, it was incon-
venient for us to put her up. Also she would be obliged to
leave rather early the next morning, and travel by a slow
Sunday train. For some seconds she stood still under the
influence of two absolutely conflicting states of consciousness ;
then remarking that she did not in the least want to stay
another night in the place, nevertheless turned and went back
to the house. The sequel to this incident occurred later in
the same evening, when my wife missed a much-valued watch
and seal. After we had all engaged in a prolonged and fruit-
less search, Miss Sinclair, in my wife's presence, suddenly
opened a trunk, and, without looking, plunged her hand into
a cardboard box of odds-and-ends which was in the trunk,
and pulled out the case containing the watch and seal. My
wife admits that she would never have thought of looking in
that box, as she regarded it as quite an impossible place
for the watch to be in. Miss Sinclair therefore, by her
return, undoubtedly saved my wife a good deal of worry and
annoyance.
Impressions of this kind are probably similar to the warnings
or promptings which I believe some people experience vaguely
in their daily life, only in the case of Miss Sinclair they are
much more powerful.
The following case, however, illustrates an impression which
took the form of a clear message. On September 17, 1921,
while Miss Sinclair and I were standing in the same room,
300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1022.
she said to me suddenly,
"
I have an impression that there is
a telegram coming from Mrs. T ." About two minutes
later there was a knock at the door, and the telegraph girl
delivered, not a telegram, but an express letter from my wife.
From the room where we were standing it was impossible to
see anyone approaching the house, even after they had reached
the door, and Miss Sinclair told me her impression too long
before the arrival of the girl for her footsteps to have been
audible. In addition to this, a gale of wind was blowing at
the time, and making so much noise that it would have
effectually drowned the sound of footsteps even close outside
the door.
Another feature of the impressions which leads me to classify
them with evidential matter occurring nearly in the normal
state is the
"
unpsychic
"
times at which they are often
produced. It is a consistent feature of Miss Sinclair's sensi-
tivity that she becomes
"
psychic
"
at about six p.m., and
remains so during the evening, the degree of sensitiveness
varying, of course, from one day to another, but the period
of maximum sensitiveness is, as a rule, between six and eight
p.m. (She rarely goes into trance except in the evenings.)
Impressions, however, are frequently uttered in the mornings,
or at any time during the day.
The emergence of an impression is evidently the last stage
in the uprising of an idea from the subliminal depths through
the various strata of consciousness, for it often happens that
an incident which has been expressed in the trance script
emerges several days later, generally in a fragmentary way
as an impression. This occurred, for instance, in the clair-
voyant discovery of a brooch which had been lost and buried
in the soil. The brooch was described and drawn in trance
script on August 28, 1921, and then described to me by Miss
Sinclair as a piece of interesting news, from an impression
which came in two parts on September 15, 1921. (Amnesia
after trance is always complete.)
I am bound to admit, however, that it is difficult to draw
a definite line between the state in which the sensitive writes
her impression and the clairvoyant state. This latter is
certainly a definite departure from the normal. It is a state
in which she is sometimes able to express by word of mouth
JUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 301
things (such as unseen cards in a shuffled pack) which would
otherwise only emerge in trance.
Indications are constantly occurring of impressions which are
too vague for expression, and of which no doubt Miss Sinclair
is vaguely conscious when they first occur, but which do not
-emerge into full consciousness until evoked by the fulfilment
of the incident. A particular remark, or a small household
accident, for instance, sometimes causes her to go into a fit
of laughter, and say,
"
I knew that was going to happen
"
;
but the foreknowledge was so vague that she was unable to
express it, and was herself, I think, barely conscious of it
until fulfilment brought a memory that was stronger than the
initial impression. Since there is in these cases no real evidence
of precognition, they may be explained as cases of false recog-
nition, but, for myself, I doubt this explanation, in view of
other precognitive cases which have been written down prior
to their occurrence.
The difficulty of bringing out an impression, even when it is
quite clearly in the sensitive's mind, is illustrated by the
following instance :
I was one day starting out to fetch the newspaper from the
neighbouring village, where it is left for us by the motor-
omnibus. Miss Sinclair was in another house close by, but
knew that I was going to fetch the paper, and also had an
impression that it was important for evidential reasons con-
nected with a case she was then producing, that none of us
should see the paper that afternoon. She came and stood by
the gate as I was leaving, fully intending to stop me, yet
unable to do more than make some ordinary remark. Just
as I was returning she again came out to meet me, badly
wanting to tell me that I must put the paper away without
opening it, but was again unable to do more than speak about
something quite irrelevant. The result was that the evidence
for one of her clairvoyant cases was partially spoilt.
Analgesic and Anaesthetic State.
I had been for some time aware that analgesia accompanied
at any rate the light stage of trance, and probably the deeper
stages also. On December 10, 1921, I discovered that in the
302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
analgesic state there is also insensibility to contact, and also
that the analgesia and insensibility spread over the border state
between trance and waking to a point in which Miss Sinclair
is, to all appearances, fully awake.
On evenings when the analgesia is pronounced, she cannot
feel deep pricks with a needle. She will seize things without
any discomfort, which are too hot for anyone else to hold,
and I have seen her rashly take hold of the chimney of a
lighted oil lamp, and feel nothing at the time, though blisters
resulted next morning. On evenings such as these, she goes
on doing things as usual, although she practically cannot feel
at all. She can thread a needle, do needlework, in fact she
is able to
"
carry on
"
so very much in the ordinary way that
until quite recently no one ever suspected that she has what
she calls
"
non-feeling
"
evenings, and this in spite of the fact
that she has had them from childhood. They are in no way
the outcome of the development of her psychic gifts.
Since the development of her sensitive faculties, anaesthetic
evenings have become much more frequent.
Everything that she does at these times is done by sight
alone. This I discovered by testing her with a reel of
cotton. When the reel was on the table in front of her, and
she could see it, she had no difficulty in picking it up, but
when I put it on the floor under the table, and she had to
grope for it, without being able to see it, she rolled it about
under her hand without being able to feel or grasp it, and
when I pretended to put the reel in her hand, she could not
tell without looking whether it was really there or not.
If, when she was standing up, I gave her a push in the back,
she had the curious experience of seeing herself move forward
without feeling the cause.
She cannot, in this state, move her fingers rapidly back-
wards and forwards without looking at them. When she tries
to do this with her hand behind her, with the utmost effort
that she can make, the hand will only give a kind of con-
vulsive grasp. It would seem that, in the absence of sight,
the reactive sensations from the moving fingers are necessary
to supply information as to how they should be moved from
moment to moment. The same applies to other muscles of
the body, so that she can scarcely move in complete darkness.
1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 80-'J
I am inclined to think that the sight of objects does bring
into existence an hallucinatory sense of resistance from contact
with them. Miss Sinclair, when in this analgesic condition,
walks by sight, but I think that, to some extent, she has a
false sense of feeling the reaction of the ground on her feet,
so long as she can see it. In a darkened room she is unable
to take a single step, and she says that it is a most alarming
experience to try to move at all in complete darkness.
On several occasions, she has said to me in the evenings,
that she has had an extraordinary feeling of lightness, and,
at the time, I had wondered what could cause it. It was
undoubtedly due to the absence, or partial absence, of the
sensation of the pressure of the ground on the soles of her
feet. When walking out of doors on a windy night in this
state, she can hear the wind in her ears, but cannot feel it
on her face. Sometimes she will stamp hard on the ground,
and say she can just feel that.
I think the insensitiveness extends to the internal, as well
as to the peripheral, organs of the body ;
it does at any rate
to the muscular sense, since she says an object feels lighter
to lift at
"
non-feeling
"
times. A headache also disappears,
but a feeling of general tiredness and exhaustion is still present.
Perhaps more sensation is left in the mouth than elsewhere,
for she told me that she could just feel biting her tongue
when she was insensitive to everything else that I tried. She
does not eat much on evenings when these symptoms are
pronounced, as eating is naturally rather difficult, and also
unsatisfactory for the reason that the sense of taste diminishes
with that of feeling. Miss Sinclair regards it as pure waste
to eat chocolates in a
"
non-feeling
"
state.
The sense of smell seems to vary as that of taste, as far
as I know at present, while that of hearing (I think) remains
unaffected, but a certain degree of hyperaesthesia of the
sense of vision is present, apparently as a natural compensation
for the loss of the sense of touch. Miss Sinclair says that on
"
non-feeling
"
evenings everything appears to her about twice
as bright as at other times, and she can see correspondingly
better in partial darkness.
It is to be understood that all the above phenomena admit
of variations of degree. On some evenings, for instance, she
A3
304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
can feel a severe prick with a needle slightly, and can just
feel the pressure if her hand is squeezed very hard. On
others again the symptoms may scarcely be present at all.
The above observations are admittedly rough, and it yet
remains to make more exact experiments.
The Clairvoyant State.
During October, 1921, Miss Sinclair had begun to take a
certain amount of interest in cards from a psychical stand-
point, as a result of the unusual success she seemed to attain
in certain games. She thought this success was due to her
knowing the denominations of some of the cards while they
were still lying face downwards on the table. This led to her
trying the experiment of naming, or guessing, the cards one
by one in a shuffled pack, before turning them up. In this,
however, when tried as an experiment, she had no more
success than chance would account for, but she discovered
that, if she could distract her supraliminal consciousness by
reading a book, while at the same time idly turning the cards,
she could get into a psychic condition, which I here call the
"
Clairvoyant State," in which she could, and did, according
to her own statement, on several occasions get about forty
cards right out of the pack. It is to be understood that only
the denominations of the cards came to her, and that she did
not say them aloud before turning the cards up, but only
thought them to herself. She can never get the suit, and she
has always been shaky on court cards. The reason for this is
that she does not as a rule see a mental image of the card,
but a rather shadowy Arabic numeral which indicates its
value. In the case of court cards, however, I gather from her
description that she does see an image of the card, or something
like it.
This clairvoyant state appears to be differentiated from the
waking state, for Miss Sinclair, although to all appearances
awake, if a little passive, finds great difficulty in speaking
when she is in it. On one occasion, when I was reading in
the same room, and at a short distance from her, she wanted
to tell me to come and look at the cards she was turning,
but was unable to do so. Also any attempt to write while
JCNK, H)22. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 305
_
in this state immediately induces trance, the writing merging
into trance-script.
On the other hand it differs from light trance, in which the
personality undergoes a certain change of tone and outlook,
not observable in the clairvoyant state ; nevertheless, there
seems but a slight step from the one condition to the other.
Another point of difference is that Miss Sinclair can move
about and do things when in the clairvoyant state, but not
when she is in trance.
The same interesting point which was noticed in connection
with the impressions comes out again here, but more clearly,
viz. the fact that the supernormally acquired idea can only
be expressed with great difficulty and effort, if at all, while
it may be clearly present to the consciousness. In the
in which Miss Sinclair turned up the cards from a pack,
of course I urged her to tell me the card before turning it.
Although she tried very hard to do so, for some time she
found it impossible. She would say,
"
I can see the card, but
I can't tell you what it is," and she compared the feeling to
that of listening to someone speaking in a foreign language,
and being able to understand, but not being able to find the
words in her mind with which to frame an answer. After
some practice, however, she was able by making a great effort
to get out the denominations of four or five of the cards.
She had to get herself into a state of great tension, and the
number, when it came, was uttered explosively, as it
might be
by someone who was making a great muscular effort. After
giving four or five cards she was usually exhausted, but I
think it quite likely that with practice this effort might be
reduced, and the number of cards extended.
There does not seem to be much object in endeavouring to
obtain a long series of cards, as the probability of getting even
a very small number in sequence correct by chance is so ex-
tremely small that chance is easily excluded.
There is another feature of the mode in which these clair-
voyant perceptions emerge which is worthy of notice, and this
feature is shared also by the trance-script, and by the
impressions, and as far as I know by all subliminally perceived
ideas. Miss Sinclair is obliged to sort out the constituent
parts of the idea, and set them in order before expressing
306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1922.
them. Sometimes she inverts the order of two cards in the
pack. When doing automatic writing she explains that the
cause of the writing being so slow is that she has to arrange
the words in their proper sequence, having apparently got
an impression of them all at once. She does not seem to
get the parts of a subliminal idea in sequence in time, but
simultaneously.
Light Trance.
When Miss Sinclair sits down to do automatic writing, she
first of all passes into a state of light trance. I think this
light trance is always under the control of her own will,
though when she is exhausted with too much psychical activity,
or by a combination of psychical and physical tiredness, she
slips into this state very easily, and finds it difficult to keep
out of it. When she intends to go into trance, the fact of
holding a pencil in her hand on a sheet of paper is sufficient
to induce it in three or four minutes as a rule. She says she
simply lets herself go, and her surroundings, the room and the
people in it, get smaller and smaller as she passes into trance.
She is able to describe the sensation whilst it is taking place,
and under ordinary conditions she says it is not unpleasant.
When in light trance she still speaks in her usual voice,
only with some difficulty and hesitation, but she can carry
on a conversation. The change in her appearance is very
slight. There is an enlargement of the pupil of the eye, and
a restless movement of the eyes even when closed, as can be
seen by the slight bulge which the iris causes in the eyelid,
but these symptoms are not very marked. In a dim light
one would not know, and Miss Sinclair sometimes informs me
of the fact by saying, "I am in light trance now, I want to
tell you so-and-so." There is a change in her manner and
mode of speaking, which becomes more childlike. When in
light trance she says she is unable to perceive her surroundings.
She fails to recognise anyone except my wife and myself, and
I have asked her whether she sees me, since she seems to look
at me, but her answer is,
"
Oh, I know you're there." When
I ask her what she sees in light trance, she says everything
is misty. She knows more about her psychical work in light
trance than she does when waking, and frequently tells me
JIM:, !!>. The (7a.se

things that are going to happen with regard to it, which, I
have found, generally turn out as she says. I do not mean
really precognitive statements, but statements of things that
she herself is going to do or say. Her outlook too is different,
being much more stable and consistently interested in her
psychical work than when she is awake. If over-tired, etc.,
Miss Sinclair, if I may say so, sometimes gets rather tired
and disgusted with her psychical work. At these times her
ittitude changes completely when she enters light trance ;
she
likes being in trance then, and proceeds to take a much rosier
view of things.
The analgesia which I have before described is also a feature
of light trance, and I will quote the following experiment to
illustrate it.
On the evening of September 22, 1921, after dusk, Miss
Sinclair went into light trance, and I thought I would test
her degree of analgesia by giving her a really deep prick with
a needle. I therefore took a large darning needle, and pressed
it into the side of her hand above the little finger for nearly
a quarter of an inch. She felt nothing, and merely asked
rather scornfully if I supposed she could feel that. The next
morning she came to me and said she had got a thorn in her
hand, and asked me if I could get it out. I knew then that
I must have been clumsy enough to break the point of the
needle in her hand the night before. The flesh had closed
over the piece of needle, and she seemed so sensitive to pain
that I resolved to postpone the attempt to extract it until
she went into trance. (Miss Sinclair says that in the normal
state she is more sensitive to pain than other people.) At
the next writing sitting, the script said that the needle must
be removed, or it would go further in ;
also that its presence
worried her, and interfered with her psychical work. It was
interesting that the script referred to it as a needle, for in
the waking state she still continued to believe it was a thorn.
On the following day she went into trance for the purpose
of having the needle removed. I made quite a deep incision
with a sharp instrument, and probed for the piece of needle,
but without being able to find it. However, I bound up the
hand, and by the next morning the piece of needle had come
out on the lint of its own accord, and the wound then healed
308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
quickly. She had felt absolutely nothing of the clumsy
operation I had performed on her, and even when the needle
was out she still continued to believe it was a thorn.
As far as I have been able to ascertain up to the present,
Miss Sinclair when in light trance knows nothing of what
occurs in the deeper stages. Her memory is bounded by
deeper trance on one side, while on the other it extends over
the analgesic state before described, to the borders of the
waking memory. One day she walked with me to the neigh-
bouring town, and we returned in the evening by the motor-
omnibus. At about 5 p.m. (her psychic time was beginning
rather early just then), whilst we were in the bus, she entered
the analgesic state, and also began to note down one of her
impressions. The next evening, while she was in light trance,
I asked her if she could remember what she had done the day
before. She said she could remember vaguely having gone
somewhere, but could not remember the name of the place,
but could remember returning in the motor-bus, and writing
her impression in it ;
that is to say, her memory began from
the point where she had entered the analgesic state.
On another analgesic evening, she suddenly mentioned having
broken a particular dish quite six years ago, and this my
wife dimly remembered to have been the case. Miss Sinclair
said that when she broke it she was in a
"
non-feeling
"
state, and that was why she remembered it on this occasion.
In the normal state she had no recollection of it.
When she is in the analgesic state her memory does not
extend to light trance. It covers the analgesic state itself
(for which it is
particularly good), and also most of the
memories of the waking state. I think that as her condition
changes, moving through the border state, and on into the
trance proper, the upper and lower limits of the memory move
with it towards the trance.
Writing Trance.
During writing sittings the sensitive passes rapidly through
a short initial period of light trance into the deeper stage in
which she writes. The pencil at first meanders slowly about,
making meaningless scribbles, then it begins a more purposeful
JUNK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 309
and legible though still scrawly writing, her expression becomes
more absent, and she does not smile, but she still speaks
occasionally in her ordinary voice, generally in explanation of
some point in the writing. Speaking, however, appears to be
a somewhat difficult process, and she is sparing of words.
If the sitter asks her a question, she either ignores it or
else pauses, and looks round over her shoulder, as if referring
to some unseen person for information, after which she proceeds
to write the answer in the script. This gesture is repeated
also from time to time during the writing, without any question
being asked.
The legible writing is not continuous, but is interspersed
with periods of scribbling, and it is possible that these two
phases correspond to two distinct stages of trance. The
writer of the script says that some scribbling is inevitable at
an early stage in the development, and evidently expects it
to disappear later on. The writing is produced very slowly.
At normal times, when Miss Sinclair is well and not over-
tired, the passage into and out of writing trance is quite rapid
and easy, and after the trance she has only to sit still for
a few minutes to feel quite herself again, but during some
of the earlier sittings the process took longer, and amnesia on
waking was not complete. This had the curious result of
giving her the feeling that the room in which she held her
sittings was uncanny. She thought of it as full of spirits,
and these spirits were apparently semi-transparent beings only
a few inches high, and provided with wings, with which they
flew ceaselessly round and round her. She admitted that they
had pleasant faces, but her ground of objection to them was
that it was unnatural and uncanny that they should intrude
themselves (as she conceived they did) into the waking world,
where they did not belong. After the first few sittings, the
break of memory on returning to consciousness after the trance
became complete, and all idea of there being anything un-
canny about it disappeared. Exhaustion or ill health has the
effect of making the return to consciousness more difficult and
slower than it is at other times, and this may give rise to an
unpleasant and rather terrifying experience for the sensitive,
who is left for a time with vision only partially restored, and
feeling entirely absent, and naturally wonders where she is and
3 1 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
what is happening to her. The experience must be terribly
bewildering, and it is small wonder that at such times Miss
Sinclair has a horror of trance sittings.
During the writing trance the very smallest sounds are dis-
turbing and apt to interrupt the script, and a sudden noise
is likely to be disastrous in its effect, as it awakens the
sensitive with a start, and produces a nervous shock from
which it may take her a month to recover. After receiving
a shock of this kind, great courage is required on her part
to embark on the next writing sitting, for the trance only
comes on with difficulty, and the feeling is then, as described
by her, like that of letting oneself slip down alone into a
dark place ;
but when the first sitting is over, she does not
mind the subsequent ones. The results of a shock manifest
themselves in nervous symptoms, which are pronounced at
the
"
psychic
"
times (6 to 8 p.m.), including sometimes fits
of trembling and signs of nervous over-tension, and there is
also a strong tendency to relapse into trance during the evening
and in the night. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance
that conditions of complete silence should obtain for the
writing sittings, and it is very unfortunate that these con-
ditions should be so difficult to obtain. Sittings are always
held in the evenings, and the time is carefully chosen when
disturbances are least likely every door and window has to
be carefully fastened, and sometimes a sentry has to be posted
outside the house to intercept possible callers. Even then
the discharge of a gun some distance away, a sudden gust of
wind, or a dozen small noises over which one has no control,
may upset the sensitive to a greater or less extent. The only
real solution to the difficulty would be a sound-proof room.
It will be seen that the writing sittings in Miss Sinclair's
case are rather an anxious business, and this, in addition to
my desire not to interfere with the production of the script,
is the reason why I have not made more experiments with her
physical condition. There is, I think, hyperaesthesia of the
auditory sense, but it may also be that noises, without being in
themselves intensified, produce a very worrying effect when
the attention is strained on the work of producing the script,
as indeed they do in ordinary life, when one is thinking
intently. When Miss Sinclair has been in very good health
and fresh to the work, I have noticed that sounds, in this
stage of the trance, have much less effect on her.
The writing trance is rather exhausting, and the vitality of
the sensitive is certainly lowered whilst she is in it. The
room has to be well warmed in winter, or she will easily catch
cold, and in summer the windows are closed to exclude draught
as well as noise.
The content of the writing is largely of an advisory nature,
and continually urges Miss Sinclair to persevere with the
development of her psychical powers. It also supplies necessary
information about the evidential cases. Cards, for instance,
in the clairvoyant experiments, are much more easily given
in the writing trance than they are by word of mouth in the
clairvoyant state. The writer of the greater part of the
script claims to be Miss Sinclair's subliminal self. (Perhaps it
is hardly correct to say that this claim was actually made.
I had always represented it in this light to Miss Sinclair, and
the suggestion was tacitly adopted in the script. On the
only occasion on which I asked the writer of the script for
a name, the answer given was
"
The Advisor.") But there
has been a certain small amount of writing given in a
deeper stage of trance of which the subliminal does not claim
the authorship, and of which I will speak later (see p. 313).
On two isolated occasions only has there been any claim
that a message was given from the dead, when, on each
occasion, Omar Khayyam made a meteor-like appearance, and
favoured us with a misquotation from the Rubdiydt.
A Possibly Precognitive Trance State.
At a sitting held on October 10, 1921, Miss Sinclair appeared
to go into a new kind of trance, in which she was, on that
occasion, still more sensitive to sounds than in ordinary writing
trance. Three times, as she was entering it, she was brought
back by the faintest sounds, and I was obliged to remove my
wrist-watch, as its ticking disturbed her. When at last she
got into trance, the writing was produced with laborious
slowness, and she said,
"
It's all different ;
I can't write any
faster." At the end of the trance the subliminal wrote a
312 Journal of Society for Psychical Reject rcA. JUNE, 1922.
warning to be careful afterwards, and Miss Sinclair woke up
a good deal exhausted.
The subsequent occasions on which she has been in this kind
of trance have been in connection with evidential cases of
precognition, some of which have been of extraordinary interest,
but the worrying effect of slight sounds has not been so
marked as it was on the first occasion.
I have to rely here a good deal on the account which Miss
Sinclair gives of her subjective experiences, but I think it will
be of interest to notice the way in which a piece of pre-
cognitive evidential material appears to be got through. There
is first a period of strain and effort, while she appears to
grapple with the test, saying in trance that she finds it very
hard, and frequently ejaculating things in a perplexed sort of
way, as,
"
Oh, numbers, numbers, they're all mixed up !
"
Then comes a wave of satisfaction and relief, and she announces
that she has accomplished a new test. It is noteworthy that
when this stage is reached, she always looks upon the thing
as done, although she is still quite ignorant of what it is.
It still lies below the level of consciousness, even in light
trance. Afterwards it may be a day or more later a second
and smaller effort brings the test to the surface, either in the
form of an impression or else at a trance sitting. This
process always suggests to me the existence of a number of
different levels, or depths in the subliminal region of the self,
and that it is the passage of a piece of evidential material
through these strata of consciousness that is the really difficult
part of its production. Constant communication may be going
on for all we know between one person and another at some
deep level of the subliminal self. It is possible that we may even
be able to influence one another in ways which a good deal
transcend our ordinary ideas of telepathy, but nothing can be
known of this unless we can devise means of bringing to the
surface things which happen in the depths of consciousness,
and in getting them expressed in a form which will appeal
to the physical senses. Here would seem to be the crux of
psychical investigation at the moment, and it would seem
to suggest the great importance of studying the states of
trance.
JINK, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair.
Deep Trance.
On certain occasions the ordinary writing trance has given
place to a deeper stage in which the writing is slower, more
laboured, and to a certain extent different in character, if the
automatic scrawl can be said to possess any character. Warn-
ing is usually given in the ordinary script that the deep trance
is about to begin, and advice given for special care afterwards.
I find myself unable to describe the visible difference between
the deep and the ordinary stages. I think that Miss
Sinclair's expression changes somewhat, but all that I am aware
of at the time is a peculiar feeling of tension while the deep
stage lasts, and of relief when it is over. The deep stage is
used when attempts are said to be made to produce evidential
messages in the script, and on two occasions something in the
nature of cross-correspondences are claimed to have been given
in it, but up to date these claims have not been proved.
About the time that the deep trance was being established
as a more or less regular feature of the sittings, and I was
being advised to regard it as the most important part of the
work, particular difficulty was being experienced in obtaining
sufficiently quiet conditions. After the conditions had been
improved, the intelligence, or intelligences, who direct Miss
Sinclair's psychical development, seem to have changed their
policy, and abandoned, at any rate temporarily, the writing
sittings in favour of experiments in clairvoyance and pre-
cognition, which were brought to the surface a good deal in
the form of impressions.
I think this may have been partly because Miss Sinclair was
getting rather overstrained, and was probably not in a con-
dition for deep trance.
It is of the deep trance writing that the subliminal dis-
claims the authorship, but no signature has ever been given,
or claim of authorship made for it. There has not been
enough material given up to the present in this stage of trance
to enable me to judge of its probable ultimate value, but I
feel certain that interesting results of some sort will accrue
when we are able to get back to it.
In the development of this case, I have been struck by the
way in which events have been ordered by an intelligence
314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922
(or intelligences ;
Miss Sinclair when in light trance often refers
to a mysterious "they") behind the scenes. When I began,
it was my intention to concentrate chiefly on experiments in
telepathy, and I imagined that the arrangement of these
experiments would be entirely in my own hands. I found that
this was not the case, however, and Miss Sinclair's sensitivity
began to develop itself very much according to a plan of its
own. And now I have come to feel that my role is more
that of an observer and a recorder than of an experimenter.
Telepathy has been a very minor feature in the programme,
and the crystal, which is one thing that I did introduce on
my own responsibility, has turned out to be something of a
snare.
The above are all the stages which seem to fit into a
progressive series. As I have said before, it is very difficult
to draw a definite line anywhere between state and state, and
there may be an infinite possible number of trance states, by
which I mean that all the states, including sleep and the
waking state as well, may merge into one another by insensible
gradations.
There are a few remaining points which do not fit into any
series.
Visions.
On certain occasions at night, Miss Sinclair has seen visions
which appear to be externalised things. I mention them here,
because on one occasion she attempted to describe one of these
visions to me while she was observing it, and the mode of
describing it has perhaps its bearing on the description of
"
spirits
"
by the controls of mediums. The vision was a
face. She said it looked misty or shadowy, and it evidently
appeared to be in the room with her, for she pointed into
the corner, and asked me if I did not see it too. She de-
scribed the face as being something like my own; as belonging
to a person who had something to do with me, and whose
photograph had been on my dressing table. This made it
certain that she must be referring to my grandfather, who has
been dead many years. I then asked for a description of the
face, and she gave this in a vague, uncertain and contradictory
way, which reminded me very much of the usual mediumistic
JUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 315
descriptions. I asked whether the face had a beard or a
moustache (my grandfather was clean-shaven, and appears so
in the photograph which Miss Sinclair has often seen), and she
said it had a moustache ;
then she said
"
No," it had a beard,
and seemed very uncertain even about that. Now I
think this uncertainty arose, as Miss Sinclair said at the time
that it did, not from any failure on her part to see the vision
properly, but from the fact that it was a supernormal per-
ception, and therefore she had exactly the same difficulty in
describing it as in giving the denomination of a clairvoyantly
perceived card, or in telling me an impression before it has
risen to the surface. It seems to be symptomatic of all
supernormally perceived ideas, at any rate in Miss Sinclair's
case, that there should be this difficulty in describing a thing
which is all the while present to the consciousness. The
normal and supernormal perceptions evidently do not stand in
the same relations to the functions of the brain ; they do not
seem to be equally capable of originating a motor impulse.
One is tempted to speculate that supernormal thoughts, ideas
and perceptions may perhaps be purely psychical things ;
that they do not correspond to definite brain changes, and
that the controlling consciousness, acting perhaps the part of
a switchboard operator in a vastly complicated telephone ex-
change, is at a loss to know what to do with a subscriber who
has no number. At any rate I make the suggestion for what it
is worth, that some of the apparently banal remarks and de-
scriptions with which we are familiar from mediums may arise
from unsuccessful attempts to do with supernormally perceived
images and ideas what it is easy to do with normally perceived
images and ideas, viz. to translate them into words.
Perhaps what is wanted to overcome the difficulty is a
deeper stage of trance.
The Subliminal.
On eight occasions during the development of Miss Sinclair's
trance phenomena, there has been an irruption of a different
personality which, for lack of better knowledge, I call the
subliminal self. It usually appears when Miss Sinclair is in
light trance, speaks a few words, and disappears again. It
316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1922.
refers to the sensitive in the third person as
"
She." The
voice is Miss Sinclair's ordinary voice, but the wording and
advisory nature of the, speech, as well as the manner of its
delivery, suggest the writer of the script. Sometimes, for
instance, there is a pause if one asks a question, just as there
is in the writing trance, and sometimes also questions are
ignored. Miss Sinclair calls this personality
"
the other part
of me," and sometimes, when in light trance, introduces it by
saying,
"
The other part of me is going to speak to you now."
Sometimes it makes its appearance without her knowing that
it is
coming, and she will be annoyed afterwards, and say,
"
How dare it interfere with me !
"
One might think of this
intelligence as an incipient secondary personality. I do not
know what it is, but it has not shown any tendency to push
itself further to the front as Miss Sinclair's powers have
developed, or to assume undue influence. It remains in the
background as friend and advisor.
Dreams.
I think Miss Sinclair's dream life differs from that of
ordinary people, in that the best remembered and most vivid
of her dreams do not occur during ordinary sleep. One
particularly remarkable dream, which is of a recurrent nature,
has occurred also as an experience of deep trance in the day-
time, and I suspect that when it has occurred at night, she
has been in trance, or in a state bordering on both trance
and sleep. It is habitual with her, if at all tired, to pass
into light trance first, and from it into sleep, and it seems
probable that there may be the same gradual transition between
trance and sleep as there is between trance and the waking
state.
The dreams, or trance-dreams, which she is able to re-
member sometimes repeat what has been said in the script,
especially in the way of reinforcing advice given. Sometimes
they are repetitions of visions seen in the crystal, and some-
times they refer to future events. I cannot say at the present
time how many of these may prove to be veridical ; up to
the present, two certainly have been.
In general her dreams seem to be used for the purpose of
i!)22. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 317
emphasising points in the writing, etc., which the controlling
intelligences consider to be important, or repeating them if
there is reason to think that they have not been clearly given.
Crystal Visions.
Miss Sinclair can nearly always see visions in the crystal
after looking into it for four or five minutes. It then appears
to become cloudy, and a scene appears which she is able to
describe as it unfolds itself. After a short time the scene
disappears of its own accord.
When I introduced her to the use of the crystal, it was
in the hope of being able to experiment in telepathy by
mentally influencing the visions. Here, however, I was dis-
appointed. I tried several times, by thinking of Shelley's
lines,
"
Life like a dome of many coloured glass,
Stains the white radiance of eternity,"
and endeavouring to visualise a dome of bright colours
surrounded by a white glow, to get her to see it in the
crystal. She never saw it, or anything like it. Her visions
were quite unpredictable. Sometimes she would describe
scenes from my own experience in France during the war
with a good deal of detail. In particular she described one
occasion on which I got lost on a dark night, and my diffi-
culties in getting my motor-cycle past some blown-up bridges,
and my sensations, even to that of eating an army biscuit
when hot and thirsty. "It is dry !
"
she remarked, and then
she proceeded to describe the eeriness of the scene, and
expressed alarm at the thought of being left alone among the
ruins. She described the derelict houses and the river rushing
over the wreckage of the blown-up bridge. All this was quite
correct, but she had seen a letter of mine describing the
incident at the time, and it is hard to say how much, if
any,
of it was due to telepathy.
On another occasion she described a tropical scene, com-
prising wild animals, men dressed in shooting suits trying to
shoot a tiger which was attacking a woman, etc. Afterwards
she said she wanted to get the Proceedings of the S.P.R. for
November, 1920, to find in it something which related to this
318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNK, 1022.
crystal vision. When I looked through the volume, I found
that her vision corresponded sufficiently closely to one of Mr.
Hubert Wales' thought-transference experiments (No. XII. on
p. 143). This was quite at the beginning of Miss Sinclair's
psychical work, when she had scarcely heard of the S.P.R.,
and had never read any of the Proceedings, in which she took
no interest.
Some of the crystal visions have purported to relate to
future events, but so far most of them still await verification.
I endeavoured to persuade the writer of the script to make
the script and crystal visions supplement one another, my
object being to try and discover the relation between the
states of consciousness involved in the two phenomena. The
answer given was that the scribe could not at present influence
the crystal visions, though it would be possible to do so when
the psychical development was more advanced. More recently,
one of the alleged cross-correspondences given in the deep
trance writing was repeated in the crystal in visual form.
The crystal, as I mentioned before, proved rather a danger
in Miss Sinclair's case, on account of the ease with which she
passes into trance when looking at it. Unless all the pre-
cautions for a trance sitting have been taken beforehand, it
may therefore lead to her getting a shock. On this account
the use of the crystal has for the present been discontinued.
PART II. EVIDENTIAL CASES.
The evidential cases which I have selected for publication
consist of four clairvoyant tests, and three which I may call
cases of prevision, though reserving judgment as to their true
explanation. All these tests were made with cards, which
seem to offer special advantages in cases of clairvoyance which
are absent, for example, in a book test. Even if it can be
proved that the sensitive has never seen the book, some one
else has seen it, and a roundabout theory of telepathy is not
excluded, but no one can have seen the order of the cards in
a newly shuffled pack. It is also possible to submit the
question of chance to calculation.
In the first two experiments I shuffled the cards very
thoroughly immediately before the sitting, keeping the pack
JINK, 1922. The Cae of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 31 &
face downwards, so that it was impossible for me or anyone
else to see the face of any card. Miss Sinclair then came and
took her seat beside me at the table, went into trance and
began to write automatically. The cards were before me the
whole time ;
I watched them continuously, and am certain that
no one touched them from beginning to end of the experiment,
except that after each word had been fully written in the
script, I turned up the top card.
All the experiments were done either in full daylight or by
the light of a large duplex oil lamp, the ordinary illumination
of the room.

The last card was wrong, but before it was given there was
a pause, in which the sensitive said she was tired and could
do no more. However, she did afterwards write
"

it is doubtful whether or not this card should be included.
If it is included, one may argue that before it was given
there were 3 queens in the pack of 44, so that the probability
of naming the correct card was ^, and the probability of
error was -JJ.

On October 17, 1921, at 7.45 p.m., Miss Sinclair gave the
following cards by word of mouth, having received them as an
impression :
King, ten, knave, ten, eight, six.
Later the same evening she went into trance, and said
that these cards would be found next day in a pack which
322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922-
was to be shuffled immediately before the sitting. She also
wrote the cards again in trance at 9.30 p.m., and the script
was dated, timed and attested by my wife and myself.
On October 18, 1921, at 6.30 p.m., my wife was sitting in
a low arm-chair at one side of a small table, playing a card-
game with Miss Sinclair, who sat on an ordinary chair opposite
to her. The latter then asked my wife to shuffle the cards
for her, and I quote her account of the way in which she
did so.
"
At 6.30 on October 18, Miss Sinclair asked me to shuffle a
pack of cards. We were sitting opposite to one another at a
table about 2 feet wide. She was sitting on a high chair, I in
a low arm-chair. First I shuffled the cards, passing three or
four cards first to the back of the pack and then to the front,
afterwards I shuffled the cards twice on the table in the American
way. Finally I cut the cards on my lap, and then placed them
upon the table face downwards.
The only chance she had of seeing the cards was when I
shuffled them on the table, and they were moved too quickly
then for anyone to distinguish one card from another.
After I had placed the pack on the table, Miss Sinclair moved
it to one side, but did not lift the pack more than an inch from
the table. I am quite sure she had no opportunity of knowing
how the cards were in the pack." C. M. T
From this point onwards I watched the rest of the experi-
ment myself, sitting beside Miss Sinclair at the table. She
went into trance and wrote automatically the same cards which
she had given the previous day, the pack lying meanwhile
on the table just in front of me, where I watched it till the
trance was over, after which my wife and I turned up the
first six cards.
They were :
King, ten, knave, ten, eight, six, in order.
I am quite sure that there was not the slightest opportunity
for the sensitive to take the pack and arrange it unperceived,
since either my wife or myself was watching her closely all.
the while.
After the experiment, I sat in the chair which the sensitive
had occupied, while my wife repeated the shuffling of the pack,
and I found it was quite impossible to see any of the cards.,

except once. When she cut the pack on the table, I got a
half glimpse of the bottom card, but did not see it plainly
enough to be sure what it was.
The room that night was lit by two large oil lamps.

On October 20, 1921, at 10.30 p.m., Miss Sinclair, while in
light trance, gave the following cards by word of mouth, saying
that they were for a future test. They were written down at
once, and the paper dated and attested by my wife and
myself.
The cards were :
Four, five, six, ace, two.
On October 25, 1921, at 6.30 p.m., Miss Sinclair asked my
wife to shuffle the pack for her, and, suspecting an experiment,
she shuffled them under some needlework which she had on
her lap. I was unfortunately out of the room at the moment,
but came in a few minutes later.
My wife's account is as follows :
"
This evening, while my husband had gone out, Miss Sinclair
asked me to shuffle a new pack of cards. I had some white
work on my lap, and I shuffled the cards twice and cut the pack
all under the work, so that it was impossible for her to see them.
In fact, I could not see the cards myself. I then placed them
face downwards on the table and she did not touch them at all.
Here my husband returned. Miss Sinclair then took a pencil and
paper and sat down at the table. She went into trance, and
wrote the following numbers :
4, 5, 6, 1, 2. I saw the numbers
written on the script, and my husband then said each number
aloud before he turned up the card, and each card was the number
he called." C. M. T
When I came in the pack was lying face downwards on
the table, and I pushed it to the far corner, and watched it
till the end of the experiment. No one touched it. Miss
Sinclair sat beside me at the table, went into trance, and
wrote :
Four, five, six, ace, two.
324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922..
I then turned up the cards one by one from the pack, and
they were :
Four, five, six, ace, two, in order.

VII.
This case contains a very interesting feature, in that it was
apparently fulfilled twice over.
On October 27, 1921, at 6 p.m., Miss Sinclair gave the
cards :
Ten, eight, five, nine, three, two, knave, queen.
They were spoken in light trance, and immediately written
down by me, and the paper dated and attested by my wife
and myself.
On October 28, 1921, Miss Sinclair asked me to shufne a
pack that she might amuse herself by turning the cards up
alone, as she was accustomed to do. I did so, but remember-
ing the test given the night before, I stood watching till
twelve cards had been turned up. They were all different to
those of the test, so I turned away and began to read. Soon
Miss Sinclair said that she felt she was going into trance,
and thought that the test was coming off, but I took the cards
away and dissuaded her from going into trance, telling her that
the test would not be evidential if it did come off now, as
I had not been watching her. At the same time I removed
the cards, minus those which she had turned up, undisturbed
to another room, and, on looking at them, found that the
top eight cards of the pack were actually the test cards in
order. Miss Sinclair gave me her word that she had not
touched the pack at all whilst I had not been looking, and
on counting I found that it was still only twelve cards short.
Still, I regarded the test as spoilt evidentially, but only told
Miss Sinclair that I had mixed the cards up, and that I
expected the test would be fulfilled another time. In reality
I did not expect it, but was glad to see that she took it as
a matter of course that it would be.
On October 31, 1921, at about 6 p.m., Miss Sinclair again
asked me to shuffle a pack of cards for her to amuse herself
with (just as amnesia supervenes after trance, so the sensitive
JUNK, 1922. Tli< (\iHe of Mif* Nditci/ Sinclair. 325
is always ignorant, when in the normal state, of when trance
will occur, or an incident be fulfilled). I took the cards away
to a small table in the corner of the room, and, turning my
back to the room, shuffled the cards face downwards three
times by the usual method of allowing the two halves of the
pack to interleave themselves rapidly by running off the
thumbs. Then I divided the pack into small ones, and placed
these about on one another in different orders. Finally I cut
the pack, and placed it on the table before the sensitive, at
the same time sitting facing her across the table watching the
pack carefully. She said,
"
Oh, can I get the test out to-
night ?
"
and brought her hands down with an impulsive
movement on to the cards. I told her to take them up
immediately, and they did not remain on the cards more than
an instant, and I am sure she did not raise a single card, for
I kept my eyes on the pack. I then pushed the pack away
from her, and she went into trance, and wrote the series of
cards again. I turned up the eight top cards, and found
they were :
Ten, eight, five, nine, three, two, knave, queen, in order.
This was attested in writing by my wife and myself.

In view of the extraordinary nature of these results, and
especially of the last three, many people will doubtless incline
to the belief that there must have been fraud of some kind.
Fraud may of course be conscious or unconscious. The idea
of conscious fraud on Miss Sinclair's part would be admitted
to be an absurdity by anyone who knew her personally, and
although it is true that personal considerations are not as a
rule allowed much weight in scientific evidence, it yet seems
reasonable to admit that one cannot know a person intimately
for several years without being able to form a fairly good
judgment as to their integrity of character.
If conscious fraud occurred in these cases, it would pre-
suppose on the part of the sensitive a high degree of
proficiency in the art of conjuring. It can hardly be sup-
posed that anyone, however expert, could rearrange a pack
326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
of cards without detection, so as to get six or eight
particular cards to the top arranged in a special order, whilst
under close inspection and in a good light. The fraud
would have to be done either by the substitution of a prepared
pack, or by abstracting the test cards from the pack before
shuffling, placing them in order, and then concealing them
until they could be replaced on top of the pack after the
shuffling was done. There were only two packs of cards in the
house when these experiments were done, one with blue backs
and the other with red. Both packs were soiled, the blue-
backed being more soiled than the red, and both were used in
the experiments. I was familiar with their appearance, and
should have immediately detected a new pack even if the
colour and design of the backs had been the same. In the
last test, Miss Sinclair was wearing a jumper with sleeves only
down to the elbow, and I should think substitution would
have been an extremely difficult feat under the circumstances
even for an expert.
As for abstracting the cards, it is true that I did not guard
against the possibility by counting the cards before shuffling.
The feat of concealing the cards would have been a difficult
one, as I was watching closely. Also there is no evidence
that Miss Sinclair possesses the slightest skill in manipulating
cards in any of her psychical states. She certainly does not
in the normal. In addition, it will be seen from the accounts
of experiments V., VI. and VII., that Miss Sinclair did not
go into trance until after I, or my wife, had taken away the
pack and shuffled it. When the pack was taken from the
table at which she was sitting, she was still in the normal
state. If, therefore, she abstracted the cards, she must have
done so consciously, and the fraud must have been deliberate.
I can only repeat that it is sufficient to know Miss Sinclair
to rule out this possibility.
Even then, it may be thought that Miss Sinclair was not
really in quite a normal state just prior to the carrying out
of these experiments, although she appeared to be, and that
she abstracted the necessary cards in some very light stage
of trance, and without any normal consciousness of what she
did.
I may point out here that her case is not really analogous
JUNE, 1922. The Case of Miss Nancy Sinclair. 327
to one in which sittings are held with a professional medium,
or even where visits are paid to the house of a private sensi-
tive. Miss Sinclair has been living in the same house with
us for months, and I have been able to observe her closely
in all her psychical states. If there had been a tendency to
fraud in any one of them, it seems in the highest degree
improbable that no trace of it would ever have been betrayed.
The point, which is of great interest, of whether or not the
cards in Case VII. were shuffled twice running, so as to bring
the eight top cards into a particular order, certainly does rest
on the word of the sensitive, though the final fulfilment of
the test does not.
If we accept her statement that she did not touch the
cards during this interval, it follows that these tests are not
strictly precognitive, or at any rate not wholly so, for the
cards could not have arranged themselves twice in the same
order by chance. It looks as though, in some extraordinary
way, Miss Sinclair is able to influence people subliminally to
fulfil her predictions, and what is more, to do things that
they could not possibly do by their own volition.
EINER NIELSEN.
IN the third part of the Norsk Tidsskrift for Psykisk Forskning
are published the reports of the committees which have been
investigating the materialization phenomena of the medium Einer
Nielsen. The document opens with an account of phenomena
produced at Copenhagen in 1921 at which were present F.
Grunewald, K. H. Krabbe and C. Winther. It will be remembered
that when Baron von Schrenck-Notzing was at the Congress at
Copenhagen he saw Einer Nielsen and gave it to be understood
that he was convinced of the genuineness of the manifestations. In
the first report here published the same conclusion is arrived at
by the investigators above named, and they say that under severe
control the teleplasma was observed in some quantity.
Early in 1922 a further series of sittings was arranged under
the auspices of the Norwegian Society for Psychical Research, and
it is their report that constitutes the body of the present journal.
The committee consisted of Drs. A. de Besche, F. Gr0n, A. 0.
Haneborg, 0. Jaeger, T. Wereide, S. Wetterstad and Profs. P.
328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JUNE, 1922.
Heegaard, C. Ihlen, C. Schnitler. The seances were held in the
Society's rooms at 22 Nordal Brunsgate and five sittings in all
Were held. At the fifth sitting the committee believed that the
phenomena were not genuine and that the piece of
"
teleplasm
which was produced was abstracted from the medium's person
and finally swallowed/' At this sitting the control was fairly
strict, although not as severe as the Committee wished owing to
the objection of the medium. The clothing worn at the seance
consisted of an overall with socks fast sewn on below, a jersey
with gauze hood attached and loose trousers. The hands were
also enclosed in gauze bags as had been done in the case of
Stanislawa P. At the sitting conclusive evidence was obtained
that the medium had been able to effect an entrance into his
clothing in such a way that it would have been possible to gain
possession of an object concealed about his person. A small
hole, of about a finger thickness and 4 cm. above the seam be-
tween the hood and the neckband, was found in the veil; and it
is through this hole that the medium is supposed to have drawn
the veiling used to represent teleplasma in order to swallow it.
Another point is that in the excremental specimens examined
were found some material which the legal chemist Bruff describes
as strong reddish brown tissue paper.
Although the sittings were unsatisfactory it is difficult to accept
the committee's findings as to fraud on the part of the medium.
There is really very little evidence to indicate that the medium
acted as the committee allege. Doubtless he got one of his
hands inside his garments, which shows that the sort of clothes
devised by the committee were not at all suitable for the purpose
of the seances. The bodily control so objected to by sensitive
persons need not be insisted on if the garments provided prevent
any ingress to the openings of the body. In the present instance
the control was not over severe, but the examination was un-
necessary if the clothes had been of the right pattern. We
have also to consider the previous seances with Herr Grunewald,
in which phenomena appeared under what seem to have been
good conditions. Generally speaking we are far from satisfied
that Einer Nielsen has been detected in fraud, although it is
possible that a more detailed acquaintance with the sittings might
modify that feeling of doubt. B. J. D.

OF THE
Society for Psychical Research
The Rooms of the Society at 20 Hanover Square, London,
W. 1, will be closed after Saturday, July 29, re-opening on
Monday, September 25th, at the Society's new address,
31 Tavistock Square, W.C. The next number of the
"Journal" will be issued in October.
CHANGE OF ADDRESS.
OWING to the fact that the lease of the Society's Rooms at
20 Hanover Square will shortly expire, the Council have been
obliged to consider the question of finding new premises.
For some time past they have been conscious that it would
be an advantage to have Rooms in a quieter position. The
amount of business transacted in the building at 20 Hanover
Square, and the constant use of the lift, make it impossible
to ensure that absence of noise which is desirable for all
experimental work, especially with persons in trance.
The Council have been fortunate in finding very suitable
premises at 31 Tavistock Square, W.C., where, as is stated
above, the Rooms will re-open on Monday, September 25th.
In the new Rooms, which are large and commodious, Members
and Associates will have the advantage of an excellent Library
and Reading-Room, where they will not be disturbed, as
heretofore, by the entry of casual visitors, and by the use
of the Office typewriter.

also Miss I. Newton, Secretary.
In view of the expiration next March of the lease of the
Kooms now occupied by the Society and a letter from the
landlords, Messrs. Knight, Frank and Rutley indicating that
they propose to raise the rent, and suitable Rooms having

Letters from the British College of Psychic Science and
the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures inviting
the co-operation of the Society in an enquiry into the recent
charges of fraud against Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane were
considered, and the Secretary was requested to reply that the
Council regretted that they could not accept the proposals,
as they were of opinion that no good purpose would be served
by the proposed enquiry.
The following letter from Mr. H. W. Pugh, addressed to
the Secretary, was read
"As an effort towards the elucidation of the uncertainties
A2
332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.
which continue to surround Psychic Photography, I beg to place
at the disposal of your Society an adequate sum, for which a
cheque is enclosed, for the purpose of conducting a series of
experiments with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane.
If your Society agrees to act, and these mediums agree to
co-operate, I would ask to be allowed to stipulate that, whilst
the experiments would be under the general direction of your
representatives, the following conditions should at first be ob-
served :
1. The mediums to be at liberty to choose their own sitter.
2. To sit in whatever place in London they may prefer.
3. To use their own cameras and slides.
4. To have two persons present, who shall be given facilities
for checking the operations of your investigators.
If effects begin to appear under these circumstances, and the
mediums become assured of the unbiassed interest of all concerned,
they and their representatives will no doubt, in the later experi-
ments, be glad to agree to such a strengthening of the conditions
as will enable your investigators to form an opinion of value.
It may be well to add that I know neither of the mediums
referred to, and that this proposal is only made because the
question as to whether Mr. Hope or Mrs. Deane can produce
a supernormal effect, will, for the majority of enquirers, now
remain unanswered until they have done so under conditions
which appear to exclude any other hypothesis. You will no
doubt kindly return the whole or any balance of the sum available
as the circumstances may dictate. A copy of this letter is being
sent to the Editor of Light."
Yours faithfully,
[Signed] H. W. PUGH.
The Council agreed unanimously to accept Mr. Pugh's offer,
and the Secretary was instructed to write to Mr. Pugh as
follows :
"
I am instructed by the Council of the Society for Psychical
Research to express their thanks for your generous offer for
the purpose of a series of experiments with Mr. Hope and with
Mrs. Deane, intended to give them the opportunity of proving
that they can produce photographs supernormally.
JULY, 1922. Meetings of the Council. 333
The Council are glad to accept the offer and to agree to the
conditions you lay down for the first three sittings. After that,
if the investigation continues :
(1) the investigator must be allowed
to vary the conditions, imposing such as in his opinion may give
adequate control without interfering with supernormal phenomena.
(2) It must be understood that Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane in
consenting to the investigation leave it to the investigator to
decide when the series of sittings should come to an end.
(3) It must be understood that the investigator is not bound
to express any definite conclusion about the phenomena observed."
Mrs. Salter was appointed a Member of the House and
Finance Committee.
GENERAL MEETING.
THE 163rd General Meeting of the Society was held in the
Robert Barnes Hall of the Royal Society of Medicine, 1 Wim-
pole Street, London, W., on Wednesday, May 10th, 1922, at
8.30 p.m.
THE PRESIDENT, DR. T. W. MITCHELL, delivered an Address,
which is now published in the current Part of the Proceedings,
Part LXXXV.
CASE.
L. 1235. A TELEPATHIC DREAM.
WE have received from Professor Gilbert Murray the following
report of a dream which appears to have had a telepathic
origin. The agent was Professor Murray's daughter, Mrs.
Toynbee. Readers of Proceedings will remember the report on
Professor Murray's experiments in thought-transference, in
which Mrs. Toynbee was usually one of the agents (Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XXIX., pp. 64-110).
The percipient's statement was contained in a letter to Mrs.
Salter, as follows :
4th April, 1922.
Here is what looks like a curious thought-transference dream,
which I have just had. On the night of Wednesday, March 29th,
I was staying with my daughter Rosalind at 16 Carlyle Mansions,
334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1022.
Chelsea. I dreamt that I went out to dine and was received
in a large room. When my host came in, I knew he was an
enemy in some sense, and thought at the same time what a nice
fellow he looked ;
but what struck me most was his gorgeous
appearance. He was dressed in a white Albanian kilt, a crimson
sash, an open waistcoat with a gold border, and something or
other blue with fleurs de lys upon it. I complimented him upon
his clothes, and he said he was the chief of the Campbell clan
and these were the Campbell colours.
I mentioned the dream at breakfast, and Rosalind said there
was a story she had meant to tell me the night before and had
thought about in bed, wishing she had told it to me. An English-
man called X. had been to school at Smyrna. Afterwards he
fought in the British army and formed part of the forces sent
to occupy Constantinople ;
there he met in the street a Turk
whom he recognized as an old school-fellow, and who asked him
to dinner the following night. They had, of course, been fighting
on opposite sides. Next night he went to the restaurant and
was confounded to find his Turkish friend in full uniform as an
Ottoman officer. There was an army order out forbidding English
officers from fraternizing with Turkish officers in uniform. The
Englishman had a moment's hesitation, and then, in his own
words, decided that it was
"
a choice between disobeying orders
and not behaving like a gentleman." He disobeyed orders, dined
with the uniformed Turk, was observed and hauled over the coals,
and eventually dismissed with a warning.
The coincidence with my dream is very striking. It is not,
of course, evidential ; but, considering the evidence already
existing of normal thought-transference between my daughter and
me, I think it looks like a case of dream thought-transference.
GILBERT MURRAY.
The following corroborative statement was obtained from
Mrs. Toynbee, also in a letter to Mrs. Salter :
April 14, 1922.
My father has sent me on your letter, asking for a statement
from me about his dream. I don't know how detailed a
statement that means ? You have already the account of the
dream from him, so I suppose this is just to " confirm
"
what
happened ?
JULY, 1922. Case : A Telepathic Dream. 335
He was staying with us here at the time as far as I remember
it was on the night of March 29th that he had the dream but
I am not positive about the date, as I made no note of it.
Any way, on the evening of the night he had his dream, we
had been talking about a certain Turkish friend of my husband's,
from whom he had just received a rather important letter. He
had been showing the letter to my father, and they had been
discussing various (political) questions arising from it. While they
were doing this I was thinking of an amusing story about this
same Turk which had been told me by a mutual friend. The
point of the story was the predicament in which a young British
officer found himself after the Armistice, in Constantinople, when,
having accepted an invitation to dinner from this Turk (an old
friend of his), while in
"
mufti," he found himself confronted at
the door of the Restaurant by a Turkish officer in the full
splendour of his
" Dress Uniform." It being strictly forbidden
for British officers to accept invitations from Turkish officers at
that time.
This story was in my mind while they were discussing the letter
from the Turk in question, and I meant to tell it to my father
at the time, but as the political discussion continued, it seemed
flippant at the moment, and later in the evening it had passed
from my mind. I only remembered it at breakfast the next
morning, when my father told me his dream.
I am afraid this is a very rambling account of what happened.
I hope it supplies what is needed ? ROSALIND TOYNBEE.
AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE CREWE CIRCLE.
EDITORIAL NOTE.
The record printed below is an account of a sitting with Mr.
Hope and Mrs. Buxton submitted to us by one of our Associates,
Major R. E. E. Spencer. Major Spencer has had considerable
experience in both normal and alleged psychic photography,
having obtained what he considers to be supernormal productions
with no one present but members of his own family. In accord-
ance with our invitation inserted in the May Journal, p. 283,
we print the record as it stands so that readers may see exactly
what Major Spencer obtained and under what conditions. The
11
extra
"
received is reproduced as Plate I. It does not resemble
336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.
what we may call the standard type obtained by Mr. Hope,
namely a face surrounded by a veil which hangs down on either
side. We have not seen the original negative without which
all criticism must necessarily be of little use,
1
but from the print
supplied by Major Spencer, we do not think that it is out of the
range of possibility that a flashlight apparatus might have been
used, if opportunity had occurred. According to Major Spencer's
report this opportunity did not present itself,
and having no
further evidence we must leave the matter there. In conclusion
we think we ought to point out that in a test experiment of this
kind it was a pity that Major Spencer's camera was left in his
unlocked despatch case in the studio with Mrs. Buxton when he
and Hope were in the dark-room. We do not imply that the
camera was actually tampered with (this appears indeed very
improbable), but the fact that Major Spencer allowed such a
possibility to arise gives the sceptic some ground for suggesting
that there may conceivably have been some opportunity for a
fraudulent manipulation in another part of the sitting, which
was either not noticed by Major Spencer at the time, or discarded
as unimportant and forgotten afterwards. We call attention
to this point in order to emphasise the importance of conducting
such experiments under exact and methodical conditions. As a
misunderstanding may arise on the question of the print, which
is reproduced, bearing the number 3, we may say that this number
is correct, and does not refer to the number of the plate.

The box of plates was never out of my sight, and was cut open
in the dark room by myself. The plates were handled and
treated entirely by myself, Hope or Mrs. Buxton in no instance
touching them.
The red light of the electric lamp at the side of the dark room
door was employed the red window in the wall at the end
of the room referred to by Mr. Marriott was not used at all 1
the bench beneath the electric light is fully lit by the red glow,
and all operations performed upon it can be clearly seen.
Neither Hope nor Mrs. Buxton knew that I intended using
my own camera and dark slides till we met in the studio. These
slides are metallic, and each contains one plate.
Hope stood on my left hand for the whole time in the dark
room, and I kept the box of plates under my right elbow during
the operations of initialling, and inserting the plates in the slides.
One plate was removed from its packet of four at a time, and
the packet was replaced in the box at once. This has been my
custom at all experiments.
My own slides were placed in my coat pocket immediately
they were filled, and it is with these two slides I am concerned.
I will leave Hope's dark slides out of the question, as I cannot
prove the futility of Mr. Marriott's Nos. 6 and 7 methods in the
case of the plates contained by them, because Mrs. Buxton was
left alone in the studio with Hope's camera, when he and I were
in the dark room together.
My own camera remained closed in my despatch case (also
closed 2
)
till I returned from the dark room, when I set it up
on its tripod, extending it, and focussing it upon the chair

afterwards used, by using the distance scale on the camera front
myself.
When the exposures were made by Hope, I had to explain
to him how to actuate the shutter as the lever on the camera
front was new to him.
The only contact made with the camera by either himself or
Mrs. Buxton, was when he touched the shutter lever twice for
each exposure.
I estimated the length of each exposure at 35 sees.
NOTES ON RECENT PERIODICALS.
IN the first number of the Quarterly Transactions of the British
College of Psychic Science, edited by Mr. Bligh Bond, is the
report on the mediumship of Miss Ada Besinnet by the Principal,.
Mr. Hewat McKenzie.
The report is
interesting from many points of view. Although
we cannot concur with much that Mr. McKenzie says it is clear
that he has taken some trouble to discover which of Miss Besin-
net's phenomena are
"
independent
"
and which are not. For
example, he obtained a piece of apparatus which registered the
moments that Miss Besinnet was standing up, which reminds us:
of the similar device used on the Continent for Florence Cook.
At the last sitting also he caused a flash lamp to be suddenly
directed on a
"
materialized
"
face with the result that the medium
collapsed and was ill for several days. It is strange that this,
method of investigation should have been employed by those who
would have been the first to condemn such proceedings had they
been in use by psychical researchers. Indeed we believe the
incident to have been totally unnecessary, and to judge from the
state of the medium when the writer met her in New York it
will not encourage American mediums to visit the College without
some guarantee that it will not be repeated.
We cannot deal in detail with the report, which does not
differ so very greatly from that previously published by Dr.
Hyslop. Mr. McKenzie has a curious way of mixing up cautious
observations with the wildest conjectures, such as the extension
of the soul parts and the scent of
"
ectoplasm
"
which he is able
to notice^whilst entering a tram car in which was installed a,
materializing medium. One more example of Mr. McKenzie's,
JULY, 1922. Notes an Recent Periodicals. 33D
curious observations. On p. 29, in dealing with the position of
members of the circle he says that
"
movements of the medium
could easily be detected by the sitter No. 9 when he was in
direct contact with the medium." Yet on p. 38 he seems sur-
prised that the sitters cannot detect Miss Besinnet's movements ;
on p. 44 he admits the surprise of No. 9 that she was able to-
rise from her chair without his knowledge, and on p. 71 seems to-
think that the way she kept on getting up was
"
quite a miracle."
In the March number of the Journal of the American S.P.R*
is a case of spirit photography by Dr. A. S. Cushman. The
author visited Mrs. Deane when in England and obtained a
portrait which he says is that of his daughter and which is
confirmed by several of his relatives who knew the girl well
when she was alive.
Mr. Dingwall contributes a short article on some experiments
with the Tromelin cylinders which do not confirm the previous
experiments made by Dr. Hyslop. The editor also has some
pertinent remarks on the Hope psychographs, showing how they
are just what one would expect if they were fraudulently produced.
In the April number of the Journal of the American S.P.R.
the editor gently reproves certain English writers for their ap-
parent insularity, and illustrates his remarks by some examples.
There is also a highly interesting case of apparent collective
visual
"
hallucination
"
and a further series of the observations
of
"
William Bruce
"
in his sittings with the Boston medium,
Mrs. Chenoweth. Another posthumous article by Dr. Hyslop
is published, whilst Dr. Prince collects some specimens of
dreams seeming or interpreted to indicate death, and Mr. Dingwall
has a note on a recent discussion of a book-test in the English
journal Discovery.
The April number of Psyche contains no article on psychical
research proper. Prof. McDougall has a paper on " A New Theory
of Laughter," whilst Mr. Cyril Burt contributes a discussion of the
"Causes" and treatment of Juvenile Delinquency." Prof. Pear has
something to say on mental tests and mentality in which he
expresses a good deal of suspicion, which anyone who has worked
them will be inclined to share. Indeed the paper is a welcome
contribution to the subject of the tests which fortunately have not
yet obtained the popularity that they have in the United States.
As Prof. Pear pertinently remarks,
"
Perhaps, indeed, it is time-
340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.
to consider more seriously the mentality of the examiner as well
as that of the examinee."
The April issue of Psychische Studien has an account of a
Finnish poltergeist which appears to have been active in 1885
in Ylojarvi near Pirkkala. There is also a review by General
Peter of Ernest Bozzano's recently published work on the pheno-
mena of haunting, and an article by Hans Hanig on ghostly funeral
processions.
In the Occult Review for June are some notes on Mrs. Hort's
recent book on Dr. John Dee. Raps and mysterious fires appear
to have been noticed, and Dr. Dee's use of the crystal is well
known. For those who wish to glance at the evidence and
descriptive matter concerning Dr. Dee's spiritualistic work, the
work edited by M. Casaubon in 1659 entitled A true and faithful
relation of what passed for many years between Dr. John Dee . . .
and some spirits will be found of some service. In the same
issue of the Occult Review G. M. Mayhew sums up some of the
lore concerning phantom coaches, whilst Mr. Stanley Redgrove has
something to say on Pasteur and the problem of life.
In the May number of the Journal of the American S.P.R. the
Editor discusses the oft-repeated assertion that spiritualism is
responsible for much lunacy and quotes the results of some of
Mr. H. J. Osborn's inquiries in this country showing that the
idea is devoid of any real foundation. Dr. Pierre Mallet con-
tributes the first part of a short paper on Psychic Phenomena
and the Physician, whilst Dr. Miles M. Dawson gives some illus-
trations of William James's opinions of psychical research culled
from his letters. A case of alleged clairvoyance is dealt with by
Dr. Prince, and Miss N. Smith contributes a short letter on Psycho
-
metrical variations in which she mentions the phenomena obtained
by a certain private medium of whom more will be heard in the
future. Finally, Sir Oliver Lodge gives his opinion on the recently
published psychic photograph obtained by Dr. A. Cushman with
Mrs. Deane.

THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY EVA C.
THE report on the above published in the Proceedings of January,
1922 (Proc. 8.P.R., Vol. XXXIL, p. 209 ff.), and the various
JULY, 1922.
Correspondence 341
commentaries thereon have furnished us all with extremely in-
teresting, although perplexing material. An outstanding char-
acteristic of these phenomena, whether they be regarded as
fraudulent or genuinely supernormal, lies in their bizarre and at
first sight meaningless and perplexing character. The rapid and
Protean changes and transformations which they exhibited is
another remarkable feature. But should we not hesitate to regard
them as fraudulently produced simply because of the above
characteristics ? There is an argument in favour of the genuine-
ness of mediums for materialization phenomena, which I do not
remember to have come across, but which is perhaps worth
mentioning. I think all who have studied the histories of
materializing mediums must have been struck by the fact that
the most startling and life-like phenomena have occurred when
the mediums concerned were in the heyday of youth, 16 to 25
years old, after which their phenomena have gradually grown
both weaker and rarer until, after middle age, they have almost
ceased to be manifested. But if the phenomena are fraudulently
produced, and that too by methods of conjuring so skilful as to
baffle the efforts of eminent conjurors to explain and expose
them, then what should we expect to find ? We should find
surely that with fraudulent mediums their earliest phenomena
would be characterised by a degree of inexperienced clumsiness
which would almost inevitably lead to speedy exposure, but,
supposing they escaped that fate, their accumulating experience
and practice should not be expected to result in a culmination
in successful deception at the age of 25 or so, but such powers
should be expected to grow and develop until well into the forties
or fifties, just as skill and effectiveness in an ordinary person's
life business grows and culminates long after the heyday of youth
and high spirits has passed away. Nevertheless it is the bounden
duty of all investigators boldly to face, consider and, if
possible, to
eliminate all opportunity for fraud in mediumistic phenomena, and
in accordance with that cautious spirit our Research Officer,
Mr. E. G. Dingwall, has stated the case from the point of view
of the conjuror for supposing fraud to be one, if not the only,
explanation of Eva C.'s phenomena ;
and I think he has con-
vinced us that the regurgitation theory (the only thinkable theory)
of the appearances which were manifested is just as difficult and
impossible to swallow as it would have been for Eva C. to have
342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922
swallowed the extraordinary object seen on her left shoulder in
Plate II. (op. cit., p. 236), in the form of a laughing face sur-
rounded by a shock of dark fibrous material resembling hair. If
we once conceive of the raw material or ectoplasm being an
emanation of protoplasmic substance highly charged with vital
forces from the body of the medium, then should we not expect
that the places most adapted to its easy exudation would be
where the more delicate and pervious mucous membranes occur,
instead of the comparatively impervious external skin ? And surely
the mucous linings of the mouth (and perhaps the oesophagus as
well) would lend themselves most readily in this case. As to the
small particles of whitish material found adhering to her garments
and the veil, which seemed under microscopic examination to
contain particles resembling paper and wood fibres ; while the
fact naturally tends to raise suspicions at first, we have yet to
consider whether, if the
"
ectoplasmic
"
emanation is genuine, we
may not suppose that, under the creative or moulding force
apparently at work, a fibrous structure in the raw material may not
likewise be brought about for purposes of enabling the moulded
forms to hold together better during manifestation, and afterwards
some of the ectoplasmic material may have failed to be re-
absorbed and have remained externalised. Granted the reality
of this ectoplasm and the intelligent moulding forces which we
must then suppose to be at work on it, we cannot then be
surprised if other startling consequences follow, including occasional
permanent materialisation. We should bear in mind that the
term
"
materialisation
"
is perhaps misleading. What we are
apparently dealing with is not the creation of matter out of
nothing, but the ideoplastic moulding and modifying of already
existing organic matter withdrawn from the body of the medium.
That the forms must be something much more than clumsy
manipulations of exgurgitated chewed paper, etc., is clearly evident
from the descriptions of the same phenomena given by different
sitters, which can only be reconciled on the assumption that the
forms were subject to the most rapid and startling changes, to
which mere paper pulp could not be imagined to lend itself.
It is a great pity that some of the photographs taken simul-
taneously by the two cameras were spoiled, thus preventing a
comparison between the view of the same manifestation as viewed
from right and left under the same flashlight. It is very remark-
JULY, 1922. Correspondence. 343
able, however, that the two successful right and left simultaneous
views of the manifestation occurring in Sitting XVII., Plates V.
and VI. (op. cit., p. 260), furnish certain features of singular
interest whose study leads to a conclusion quite opposed to the
first interpretation put upon the pictures by the sitters in the
general remarks on the seance. In the first place the accounts
by Mrs. Salter, Mr. Dingwall, Dr. Woolley and Mr. Baggally of
what was seen by them up to 7 minutes before the flashlight
photos were taken (with the exception of Dr. Woolley's remark
upon what he saw by torchlight at 7.30 p.m.) do not prepare one
at all f>r the resulting photographs, and it is expressly stated
that they constituted a surprise for the committee, and the
interpretation put upon the photos was to the effect that the
medium was holding the object or mask of a human face down
under her chin. Certainly if
only one picture at a time is
viewed this is the unavoidable impression conveyed. But I had
not compared the two views together for more than a minute
without noticing an extraordinary incongruity in the comparative
perspective which is absolutely inconsistent with the first inter-
pretation.
I was then prompted to enter upon a more thorough-going and
technical analysis of the relative perspective between Plates V.
and VI. which I sent up to the Editor of the S.P.R. (Mrs. Salter)
together with diagrams. This analysis being considered to be too
technical for full reproduction here, I have been requested to deal
more shortly and generally with the conclusions arrived at, while
the full paper is filed with the Kecords of the Society for future
reference. 1
The conclusion arrived at is that the
"
mask "
seen
below the medium's face was not nipped down under the chin,
as it appears in the single views, but was really suspended im-
mediately below her mouth, and that it was semi-transparent
enough to enable her chin to be seen through it, and not above
it. Also I called attention to the unaccountable difference between
the left eye (the observer's left) of the mask in Plate V. and
Plate VI. In the former the mask or face appears to have the
eyebrows drawn down over the eyes as if in a frown, while in
Plate VI. the left eye is much wider open and the eyebrow
drawn strongly upwards as if in a wide open stare, giving a very
1

wish to read it. Ed.
344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922,
life-like and supercilious appearance. How the mask, if it had
any appreciable weight, was supported from falling remains a
mystery. An alternative hypothesis is that the mask was not
really there at the time, and that the two images were impressed
directly upon the plates as psychic photographs, the intelligence
responsible having very crude conceptions of the appropriate
relative perspectives of the two views that would be required to
make the mask appear as if tucked under the medium's chin.
This is an hypothesis that is quite comprehensible and credible
to those who are convinced, as I am, of the reality of psychic
photographs and their being also manifestations of ideoplastic
energy, but will certainly be repudiated by those who are not*
These latter will then be obliged to accept the first hypothesis
of the mask being real and objective and suspended in some
unknown manner from the medium's mouth. Personally I incline
to accept the first hypothesis, chiefly because the notes of the
sitting state :
"
7.30 p.m. a thing somewhat similar in shape to
a child's bib is seen hanging from the medium's mouth "
;
and
again,
"
W. said that the thing looked like a picture in chalk
done on paper." There are other apparent discrepancies between
the two views of the mask on which it would be rash to form
definite conclusions without comparing together either the two
original negatives or two transparencies carefully prepared from
them.
Should these weird materializations be finally established as
genuine in the minds of many other scientific men besides Prof.
Charles Richet and Dr. Geley, there is no doubt that the latter
is right in anticipating that a radical revolution in biology and
in the theory of variations in evolution must inevitably follow.
The reign of creative intelligence and of final causes (so ably
advocated by Paul Janet in his book Final Causes, 1883) will be
restored in our scheme of Nature to the discomfiture of the
grosser Materialism.

BLEEDING STIGMATA.
1. To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, I find that the two letters you have published contro-
verting Father Thurston's statement that Stigmatization had never
JULY, 1922. Correspondence. :H.~>
been experimentally produced, do not exhaust all evidence to the
contrary.
In 1900 Pere Coconnier, a French Dominican, published a book
entitled Hypnotisme Franc, in which he repudiated the Satanic
origin of hypnotism, then commonly believed in devout circles in
France.
In it he describes a visit he paid to Dr. Charcot's institute
either at Nancy or in Paris. The doctor hypnotized a girl on
whom he had frequently experimented, and as a result of some
discussion between him and the priest, told the girl that he wanted
her at the end of 2 hours to sweat blood in the form of a cross
which he would draw on her wrist or forearm. He drew the
cross with a pencil, bound up with linen that portion of the arm,
and left her in a state of hypnosis. After 2 hours the doctor
came back, undid the bandage in the presence of the priest (Pere
Coconnier). There was the cross perfectly visible.
Dr. Charcot next proceeded to show that the same thing could
be done instantaneously, and again putting the girl under hypnosis
told her this time to sweat blood actually while he drew the
pencil across her arm. They both watched and Pere Coconnier
says that this time the cross was not so perfectly clearly marked,
but it was nevertheless uninistakeably on the arm. Of course,
strictly speaking, this is not Stigmatization, but these two experi-
ments show its possibility.
It is unfortunate that Pere Coconnier's book is now out of
print, and it is not to be found in the British Museum. It
appeared as chapters in the Revue Thomiste somewhere about
1898-1900, and is so far as I know the only book on Hypnotism
which has been written by a Catholic priest.

2. To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, Without for a moment pretending to assert that the
production of bleeding stigmata by hypnotic suggestion is im-
possible, I am still inclined to adhere to the doubt expressed in
my paper (Proceedings, S.P.R., XXXII., 200-202). It is not
disputed that
"
dermographisme
"
as the French call it, is common
enough. The hypnotizer traces a simple pattern on the skin of
his subject and suggests that after a certain interval the pattern
will stand out in vivid red. At the time indicated there is great
346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.
congestion of the capillaries beneath the epidermis and the pattern
is clearly seen. No doubt a few cases are on record in which a
slight exudation of blood has taken place, probably through the
sweat ducts. I think these cases are rare, if
only from the fact
that one always gets referred back to the same experiments with
Louis Vive at La Rochelle in 1885 (Myers, Human Personality,
I., p. 497, with references). In the Biggs case (ib., p. 493) there
was bleeding alleged on one Friday out of about 20, but Dr. Biggs
was not present at it. Moreover, he only wrote his account from
memory six years afterwards, and it is admitted that the girl was
inclined to rub the part indicated. Miss Charlton's instances
seem to me even more inconclusive. The evidence is third hand,
while date, locality and exact references are all entirely wanting.
But granted even that bleeding may occasionally occur under
hypnosis, I should be inclined to lay a good deal of stress upon
the fact that in the cases adduced there is no wound, no laceration
even of the epidermis. In the more notable examples of religious
stigmatization we have gaping wounds, both in the palms of the
hands and in the soles of the feet, where the integument is wont
to be exceptionally thick. These wounds sometimes remain open
for years, sometimes heal in an incredibly short space of time,
reopening periodically, but always without any trace of sup-
puration.
1
Mr. Hubert Wales suggests that scientists like Charcot
and Pierre Janet may have been deterred from more often pro-
ducing such bleeding stigmata out of consideration for the pain
or inconvenience caused to the patient. But why should it not
be part of the hypnotic suggestion that the wounds should open
painlessly and heal rapidly ?
1
The following extract from a report of Dr. Wesener, dated Sept. 8th,
1815, after one of his visits to the stigmatized Sister Emmerich, is in-
teresting : "I found the invalid exceedingly weak but cheerful, her hands
and feet bleeding. The wounds on the back of the hands are round and
about as large as a small coin, the edges slightly puffed up, but without
inflammation. One thing that seemed to me remarkable, though perhaps
of little importance to any but a physician, was a slight excoriation at the
lower joint of the right forefinger. This excoriation was inflamed and a
purulent liquid had collected under the epidermis in three different places.
I asked if she had scratched it with a needle, and she told me that the
day before, whilst wiping a tumbler, she had broken the rim and scratched
her finger with it. Her skin is easily inflamed and inclined to suppuration.
Let science bring this fact to bear on the unchanging condition of her
wounds." Schmoger, Life of A. C. Emmerich, Eng. Trans., I., p. 314.
JULY, IJtL'i'. Corri -i ><>,!<< nee. .'M7
Finally, it must, I think, be plain, from the whole tenor of the
paper criticised, that I do not reject the hypothesis that religious
stigmata may be caused by auto-suggestion. But we have to
proceed cautiously. It does not necessarily follow that because
suggestion can cause an exudation of blood, it can also cause a
rending asunder of the tissues, still less a perfect reunion of the
same tissues in an abnormally short space of time. This may
eventually be proved possible, but my contention is that tin-
experimental evidence available does not yet warrant our jumping
at conclusions. HERBERT THURSTON, S.J.
III.
M. FLAMMARION'S CASE.
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM, I find it difficult to agree with M. Flammarion's
opinion of the coercive quality of the case reported by him in
the Revue Spirite, and quoted in the Journal -for March. 1
As
evidence for survival, it appears to me to be in a definitely
inferior class to such cases as that of the receipt for pomatum
(Proc., Vol. XVII., pp. 181-2) and that of the note-book, recently
reported by Mrs. Sidgwick (Proc., Vol. XXXI., p. 253 et seq.),
with, which it can, I think, properly be compared. The main
weakness of M. Flammarion's case, to my mind, lies in the fact
that the information conveyed by the vision was of an incident
which occurred after the death of the supposed communicator.
To regard him as the source of it, therefore, we should have to
assume, not only that he has survived death, but that in his new
state he is
equipped with some sort of clairvoyant power. In
those circumstances, the doctrine of parsimony of new causes would
appear to require us to prefer the hypothesis of clairvoyance by
the living percipient. Of course, if we survive death, we may
also become possessed of facilities for observation in the physical
world far in excess of those we at present enjoy, but that sup-
position involves a further step, it piles a hypothesis upon a
hypothesis : we have yet to prove survival.
It will be generally agreed, I think, that for ideally good
evidence for survival of this type there are two main desiderata :
the information given should concern a fact (a) unknown to
l
Jour. S.F.R., Vol. XX., p. 244.
348 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. JULY, 1922.
anyone living, and (6) undoubtedly known in his lifetime to the
dead person purporting to communicate. For my part, I prefer,
to cases which fail in respect of (6), those which do not com-
pletely fulfil (a), so long as the fact is not known to anyone
definitely and obviously en rapport with the medium.

EEVIEW.
The Witch-Cult in Western Europe. By MARGARET ALICE MURRAY.
(Clarendon Press. 16s. net.) *
Miss MURRAY has collected from contemporary sources a very
large amount of evidence as to the practice of witchcraft in
England and Scotland, with occasional references to France,
Flanders and other lands. Impressed by the curious uniformity
of the cult in places so far apart as Sweden and the Pyrenees,
Italy and New England, and by the close connexion supposed to
exist between witches, elves and fairies, she develops in great
detail and with great ingenuity the theory that witchcraft should
be regarded as the survival of a fertility cult once prevalent
among the prehistoric inhabitants of the whole of Western Europe,
a cult which originated long before Christianity, and possibly even
before Druidism.
It would perhaps have been well if Miss Murray had given more
evidence, apart from witchcraft, of the prevalence of a uniform
religion over so large an area of Europe, and had explained more
'fully how it was that the pre-Christian fertility cults survived in
two such very different forms as witchcraft, which was from the
earliest times banned by the Church, and the Maypole dances and
similar rites, which were until the advent of the Puritans regarded
as innocent.
These, however, are matters for anthropologists. Psychical
Researchers will heartily welcome a book which presents in so
interesting a fashion the available evidence on a subject which
must always appeal to them owing to the similarity between the
phenomena reported in the case of medieval witches and modern
mediums. The similarity is of kind rather than degree, for the
greatest feats of levitation reported in recent times appear paltry
compared with the powers of flight universally credited to the
ancient witches. In this connexion however it is interesting to
note that
"
the number of cases vouched for by the persons who
actually performed or saw the feat of riding on a stick through
the air are disappointingly few," and that the drugs with which
the witches anointed themselves when preparing to fly are stated
to be of a nature which, by their action on the heart, would
cause the sensation of flying. It is to be feared therefore that
the phenomenon must be relegated to the category of what our
French colleagues call la metapsychic subjective. W. H. S.

p. 359.
A DISCLAIMER.
THE attention of the Officers of the Society has been drawn
to a circular headed "Eclectic Club, 42 Jermyn Street, W."
OCT., 1922. A Disclaimer. sr.l
Some of the copies of this circular bear the words "
Exposure
issued by the S.P.R." The Society has no kn<>\\l<'<l<_'' of the
person by whom, or the circumstances in which the circular
was issued, or as to the matters alleged therein, and repudiates
all responsibility with regard to it.
THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE SOCIETY.
AN APPEAL.
IN their last Annual Report the Council pointed out that
there was a danger of the Society's activities being severely
limited by lack of funds, and this statement resulted in more
than one Member of the Society making generous donations
towards its expenses. But these donations are not sufficient
to meet the case, and as the exact position may not have
been grasped by all Members and Associates, the Council think
that the time has come to issue a formal Appeal for further
funds, together with a statement of the considerations which,
in their opinion, make the Appeal necessary.
I. The Society is at the present time faced with the heavy
expenditure incidental to the move to its new premises. The
Council consider themselves very fortunate in being able to
secure such excellent new quarters as are to be found at
No. 31 Tavistock Square, and they feel considerable confidence
that eventually, though not immediately, the annual cost of
the new premises will prove to be lower than that of the old,
especially as the rent of the Hanover Square rooms would
have been considerably raised had the lease of them been
renewed. But the cost of the move itself will not be light.
Besides the furniture, a large number of books, papers, etc.,
will have to be removed, and a certain quantity of new
furniture will have to be purchased.
In addition to these expenses the cost of dilapidations at
20 Hanover Square will have to be met. As, moreover, the
tenancy of the Tavistock Square house commenced at Mid-
summer, 1922, and that of the Hanover Square rooms does
not expire till Lady-Day, 1923, there will be a period during
which the Society will be liable for rent under both leases.
The Council estimate that the change of quarters will cost
352 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
the Society 300, and as the Society's income is barely
sufficient to meet current expenditure, they appeal to Members
and Associates for donations to meet this necessary outlay.
II. Opportunities at the present time for the investigation of
"
physical phenomena
"
are specially favourable. Reports of
extreme interest have been published in foreign journals regard-
ing
"
physical
"
mediums in different continental countries,
whose phenomena the Council would very gladly investigate.
Until recently there have, however, been two difficulties, the
first one of personnel, the second one of expense.
The first has been removed by the appointment as Research
Officer of Mr. Dingwall, whose wide reading in all kinds of
psychical literature, together with his knowledge of the practical
methods by which
"
physical phenomena
"
can be simulated,
qualify him exceptionally for the post. The second obstacle,
that of expense, still remains to be surmounted.
As our Members and Associates will be aware, Mr. Dingwall,
by the courtesy of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, was recently
enabled to witness at Munich demonstrations of remarkable
phenomena associated with a physical medium. In accepting
Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's invitation, notwithstanding the
shortness of funds, the Council were confident that their action
would be in accordance with the general wishes of the Society.
The results of the visit, though undoubtedly important, cannot
be regarded as final, and the Council are most anxious that a
thorough and prolonged study of the same medium should, if
possible, be undertaken, and they have reason to believe that
Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing would give every facility for this.
In view, however, of the great strain thrown on the Society's
finances by the increased cost of printing and by other
increases in cost due to the war, the Council are faced by this
dilemma :
they must either forgo these and other investigations
which ought to be undertaken, or they must realise invested
funds to pay for them. This latter course, however, the
Council would adopt only with great reluctance, because the
realisation of capital must still further restrict the Society's
resources for carrying on its investigations in the future.
The dilemma can be avoided, if an annual sum of 250
were guaranteed for a period of three years. A guarantee of
OCT., 1922. The Financial Position of the Society. 353
this amount would not only secure a proper investigation of
the phenomena in question, but would also place the Society
in a position to make full use of the services of its Research
Officer in other directions. In inviting subscriptions towards
this guarantee, the Council wish to make it clear that any
amount raised in this way would be specially earmarked,
and devoted exclusively to meeting the cost of original
investigations carried out by the Research Officer under their
instructions.
Donations towards the cost of removal, and subscriptions
and contributions towards the Research Guarantee Fund should
be sent to the Hon. Treasurer,
W. H. SALTER, Esq.,

OBITUARY NOTICES.
I. MR. H. ARTHUR SMITH.
BY SIR WILLIAM BARRETT, F.R.S.
IN the death of Mr. H. Arthur Smith, at the age of seventy-
four, the Society has lost not only a former President, but one
of the oldest and most valued members of its Council. For
some years before his passing to the unseen Mr. Arthur Smith
had suffered from a serious illness which compelled him to
give up all work ;
he was tended with loving devotion by his
wife, and died at Ewell Park Nursing Home on Sunday,
14th May, 1922. He was bom in 1848, the third son of
George Smith, J.P., LL.D., of Camborne ;
his brothers were
William Bickford Smith, for many years M.P. for Helston,
and Sir George Smith of Truro, who died recently. He was
educated at Wesley College, Sheffield, matriculated in honours
at the London University in 1865, graduated B.A. in 1874,
took his LL.B. with honours in 1875, and the same year took
his M.A. and won the gold medal in Moral and Political
Philosophy, one of the highest competitive distinctions of the
University. In 1878 he was called to the Bar and practised
as an equity draftsman and conveyancer ;
his published
professional works are much esteemed, and include such
well known works as the Principles of Equity and the Married
A2
354 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
Women's Property Acts. In 1871 he married the daughter
of Mr. Alfred Budge of Camborne, who survives him. Three
of their children also survive, one daughter and two
sons, the elder of whom is Rear-Admiral A. Gordon Smith,
C.M.G., R.N.
In his younger days he was a prominent amateur cricketer,
regularly playing for the Wanderers and sometimes for the
Surrey County Second Eleven, and always a warm supporter
of the Surrey County Cricket Club. His recreation was divided
between cricket and music ;
he was a good violinist, a first-
class clarionet player, and a valued member of more than one
amateur orchestral society. In politics he was always a con-
sistent Conservative, and with his brother Sir George Smith,
was among that small band of Tory Nonconformists who
strongly supported the late Lord Salisbury.
So reserved and diffident was Mr. Arthur Smith that few
knew of his strong religious convictions and active religious
work. In 1870 he became a class leader in the Wesleyan
Methodist Church, subsequently a local preacher, and was
among the active workers and speakers at the West London
Wesleyan Mission. He was also one of the editors of the new
Wesleyan Methodist hymn book, and published two volumes
of religious addresses, entitled The Divine Parable in History
and Things New and Old.
Who would have supposed that a man with such strong con-
servatism and religious opinions, and with such a critical legal
training, would have become one of the earliest supporters
and strenuous workers of our Society. He joined the S.P.R.
as a member soon after its foundation in 1882, became a
member of the Council in 1883, and on the death of Mr. Calder
he became, at the request of the Council, the Hon. Treasurer
of the Society in 1888. This was no sinecure, for he had no
assistant, and for thirty-one years he threw his heart into the
work of the Society ;
the present writer can speak from
personal knowledge of the incessant and laborious service
Mr. Arthur Smith freely rendered to the Society. When ill-
health compelled him in 1917 to resign the post, the Council
unanimously passed the following resolution :
"
The Council desire to place on record their great regret
OCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Mr. H. Arthur Smith. 355
that Mr. Henry Arthur Smith has found it necessary, owing to
ill-health, to resign the post of Honorary Treasurer of the
Society for Psychical Research which he has held for thirty-one
years. They feel that to his zeal and devoted service much
of the success of the Society is due, and much of the freedom
from financial anxiety which the Council has enjoyed. It is
however, not only for his work as Treasurer that gratitude is
due, but also for other important assistance as a Member of
the Council. The Council hope that they may still have the
benefit of his help in this way in the future."
From time to time the Council had expressed their great
indebtedness to Mr. Smith not only for his work as Hon.
Treasurer and member of the Finance Committee, but in par-
ticular to him, in conjunction with Mr. S. C. Scott also a
very old and valued member of the Council of the Society and now
a Vice-President for the large amount of time and labour which
they devoted to carrying through the incorporation of the
Society, and the business connected with Mr. Kay's legacy,
and for their kindness in saving much expense which would
otherwise have been
"
unavoidable.
In 1910 Mr. Smith became President of the S.P.R., and his
presidential address, published in Vol. XXIV. of our Pro-
ceedings, includes a very valuable discussion on the meaning of
the term
"
evidence
"
as applied to psychical research in
general, and in particular to evidence of identity of communica-
tions purporting to come from the dead.
Mr. Smith made several valuable contributions to our Society
which were published in our Proceedings and Journal. These
include the following :

(Vol. IV. p. 117).

In conclusion, we tender to Mr. Arthur Smith's widow and
family our deepest sympathy at the great loss they, even more
than we, have sustained in the passing from this life of our
learned yet most modest and devoted friend, who was at the
same time a true Christian gentleman, and a fearless Psychical
Researcher.
II. THE REV. M. A. BAYFIELD.
BY MRS. HENRY SIDGWICK.
SINCE the last issue of the Journal the Society has sustained
a great loss in the death of the Rev. M. A. Bayfield on 2nd
August. Mr. Bayfield joined the Society in 1890, and has
been a member of the Council since 1912. He was a very
regular attendant when health permitted, but he was not a
strong man, and for more than a year had been unable to
come up to London on account of illness. In the winter he
offered his resignation, but, hoping for a recovery which never
came, he was persuaded to stay on. Those who served with
him know what a valuable member of the Council his ability
and common sense, his interest in our work and willingness to
take trouble, and his clear view as to what constituted evidence
made him.
Mr. Bayfield's name often appeared in our Proceedings and
Journal as a writer of reviews and of critical and argumenta-
tive articles. His reviews in some cases were not mere notices
of books, but substantial discussions of questions they raised.
What he wrote was always worth reading, informed as it was
by his literary ability and scholarly mind, and his power of
humorous sarcasm often made his criticism amusing. His last
contribution of any length to the Proceedings was, as our
members will remember, a paper on
"
Some Recent Cases of
OCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Rev. M. A. Bayfield. 357
Premonition and Telepathy," for which he had carefully
collected the evidence. This was by no means the only case
in which he had investigated for us the evidence for super-
normal occurrences.
Mr. Bayfield was also able to experiment in a direct manner
himself. He had at one time, I believe, had considerable
success in an attempt at thought-transference with some of
his pupils, but no detailed record of the results has, I think,
been preserved. He also co-operated with Miss Verrall, now
Mrs. Salter, in table tilting experiments, of which notices have
appeared in Journal and Proceedings. One striking case of
what we should now call a book-test occurred on one occasion
in 1903, and was described by Mrs. Verrall in a paper read
to the Society in May, 1904 (see Journal, Vol. XI. p. 249).
Mr. Bayfield was also markedly successful in relieving pain
and sleeplessness in the case of certain of his parishioners by
a method resembling that of Monsieur Coue, though practised
before we knew of the latter. The cases are described in the
Journal (see Vol. XV. p. 298).
Mr. Bayfield approached psychical research from the side of
telepathy with the living, of the truth of which he had
become convinced, partly, no doubt, through his own experi-
ence. But it was some time before he accepted communication
with the discarnate as a fact ;
and it was, I think, the
" Statius
"
case that finally decided him.
In what I have so far said, I have confined myself to Mr.
Bayfield's connection with our Society, and its work. But his
activities and interest were, of course, not limited to this, and
for a general account of these I cannot do better than quote
the interesting obituary notice which appeared in The Times
of 4th August, for leave to reproduce which we are greatly
indebted to the editor.
The Rev. Matthew Albert Bayfield, who died on Wednesday at
Hertingfordbury Rectory, Herts, aged 70, was a scholar of varied
interests who will be remembered for his novel theory of English
prosody and for his championship of psychical research, as well
as for his two headmasterships and his school editions of classical
texts.
Mr. Bayfield was born at Edgbaston in 1852, the son of a
358 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
chartered accountant, and was educated at King Edward's School,
Birmingham, and at Clare College, Cambridge, of which he was a
classical scholar. Leaving Cambridge with a high place in the
Classical Tripos, he took Holy Orders, and became successively,
between 1875 and 1900, a master at Blackheath School, Marl-
borough, and Malvern College, and then Headmaster of Christ
College, Brecon, and Headmaster of Eastbourne College. He was
a stimulating and enthusiastic teacher, and the editions which he
prepared for use in schools of Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides,
based on the larger and more advanced editions of Dr. Leaf,
Professor Jebb, and Dr. Verrall, did much to place the results of
the best modern scholarship in an attractive form within the grasp
of schoolboys.
Resigning in 1900 the headmastership of Eastbourne College for
reasons of health, he became after a short interval rector of
Hertingfordbury. His interest in scholarship remained, however,
as keen as before, although in later years he devoted himself to
English rather than to classical literature. A chance inquiry led
him to investigate the theory of English prosody, and, being
dissatisfied with current explanations of the subject, he published
in 1919 The Measures of the Poets, in which he boldly swept away
the generally accepted system and sought to substitute for the
traditional iambic base a trochaic system, by which he claimed
that every variety of English verse could be naturally explained.
He followed this in 1920 by a larger work entitled Shakespeare's
Versification, in which he maintained that the abbreviations and
apparent elisions of the text were merely devices of the early
printer, and were not intended to affect the scansion of the lines.
His theory, which involved important changes in the generally
accepted views of Shakespearian verse, aroused much interest, and
he was a frequent contributor on this subject to The Times
Literary Supplement, readers of which will remember his courteous,
but vigorous, style in controversy.
Mr. Bayfield was a man of varied interests. He was an active
mountaineer, so long as health permitted, and a member of the
Alpine Club. It was in one of his Swiss holidays that he made
the acquaintance of Dr. and Mrs. Verrall, an acquaintance which
ripened into a life-long friendship. In conjunction with Mr. J. D.
Duff he wrote the memoir of Dr. Verrall, published after his
death.
OCT., 1922. Obituary Notices: Rev. M. A. Bayfield. 359
Another consequence of this friendship was the keen interest he
developed in psychical research. He was a member of the council
of the Society for Psychical Research for many years, and con-
tributed numerous articles to its Proceedings. Convinced, as he
was, on religious grounds of the survival of human personality,
he considered that scientific research had demonstrated, not only
the fact of survival, but also the possibility of communication
between the dead and the living. He vigorously defended
psychical research before the Church Congress, and in the pulpit
and elsewhere he spoke frankly of his beliefs to his parishioners,
holding that in this way he might best help them. He quoted
with much pleasure the saying of one of them that he had
"
taken
away the fear of death."
The above account will give some indication of his many-sided
activity and enthusiasm. To his charm of manner, his sincerity
of mind, and his warmth of heart his many friends can testify.
His wife (Miss Helen Boyes) died in 1918, and he leaves one son
and one daughter. His younger son, Lieutenant Geoffrey Bayfield,
went down with his ship at the Battle of Jutland.
PHYSICAL PHENOMENA RECENTLY OBSERVED WITH THE
MEDIUM WILLY SCH. AT MUNICH.
[Note. At the end of May, 1922, the Research Officer, accompanied by
Mr. Harry Price, a member of the Society, visited Munich on the
invitation of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing. The object of the visit
was to be present at a few sittings with the Austrian medium,
Willy Sch., concerning whose phenomena the Society had received
the most favourable reports. On July 13th, 1922, Mr. Dingwall
read a paper at a Private Meeting of the Society in which he
described the phenomena observed, and the following consists of
an abbreviated version of that report. ED.]
WE left London on Sunday morning, May 28th, and arrived the
next day in Munich, the first seance being arranged for the same
evening. Before dealing with the phenomena we observed, permit
me to tell you something about the medium and the general
conditions. Sitting merely as privileged guests we made no
elaborate investigations of any kind. All we did was to try to
assure ourselves of the nature of the phenomena presented, by
confining our attention to those conditions which seemed to us
the most important.
360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
The medium, Willy Sch., is a young Austrian of about eighteen
years of age ;
one of a large family, he was born in a small
frontier town near Simbach and is of humble origin. He first
claimed the attention of Baron von Schrenck in 1919, and some of
his early efforts in teleplastic mediumship are illustrated in the
English translation of the Phenomena of Materialisation in figures
221-225. Besides the appearance of teleplasm, other phenomena
soon commenced, including telekinesis, and Baron von Schrenck,

seeing the importance of the manifestations, resolved to try to
remove Willy from his rather unsatisfactory surroundings and
take him to Munich. In this he was fortunately successful,
Willy having been in Munich since October 3rd, 1921 ;
and being
now apprenticed to a Munich dentist, he gives about two
sittings per week in the Baron's own laboratory. Here he has
given nearly sixty seances from October, 1921, to the end of June,
OCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 361
1922. Among the sitters have been twenty-seven German univer-
sity professors, eighteen doctors and sixteen other savants. Some
of these savants have attended sixteen to thirty sittings, and in
sixty seances only three have been negative. Not one of these
ninety persons hitherto invited has put forward the supposition
that the medium is in any way normally responsible for the
phenomena. The medium himself is of moderate height, slim,
dark, and of average intelligence. He is very fond of outdoor
sports, and I was assured by Baron von Schrenck that he is so
far normal in almost every respect. The seance room is the
Baron's own private laboratory, of which we have a diagram here
reproduced from his work on materialisation. The door P leads
to the passage and washing basins. This door is of oak, opens
inwards and has a turn bolt on the inside, besides a lock. The
room belw is part of the kitchen, whilst that above is a drawing
room. The back wall is an outside wall looking on the passage
leading to a side entrance to the house. The door A leads to an
ante-room where the sitters assemble before and after the sittings,
and has itself two doors, one to the passage and so to the other
parts of the house, and the other to Baron von Schrenck's study,
where the dressing of the medium takes place.
Let me now briefly describe the general conditions so that you
will be able better to appreciate the phenomena when I come to
describe them. The medium and sitters, who number usually any-
thing from six to ten, gather in the ante-room before each sitting.
At the appointed time Dr. von Schrenck takes the persons who
are to assist at the fore-control of the medium into his study,
where the medium's black tights, dressing-gown and slippers are
examined. The gown and slippers are Dr. von Schrenck's own,
the former being worn only on account of the medium complaining
of cold during the seances. After the examination is
completed
Willy enters, and having undressed, puts on the tights, which are
in one piece, buttoning up the back. Then accompanied by the
controllers the medium enters the seance room and takes his
place to the right of the room in front of the cabinet at about
the spot indicated on the plan. This cabinet is not used for
these sittings, being the one formerly employed in the Eva C.
and other experiments. The control is of the simplest and most
efficient character. Indeed it may be said that in no case of
physical mediumship has such a control been before attempted
362 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
with success. Fortunately for Baron von Schrenck the medium
demands a rigid control, and as in the demonstration sittings we
attended the extrusion of teleplasm formed no part, an elaborate
and minute searching was avoided at every sitting, thus con-
siderably simplifying an already easy task. The medium sits with
his back to the cabinet at about three and a half feet from the
curtains. Opposite to him sits one of the controllers who holds
both hands and either extends his legs so as to form a barrier
between the medium's legs and the circle, or places his feet on
those of the medium. A second controller sits facing the circle
and at right angles to Willy. He holds the medium's wrists
or lower parts of the arms, whilst slipped over the sleeve of the
tights, just above the wrists, are luminous bracelets which enable
the circle to see the position of the medium's arms at any time.
In addition to these measures the arm of the medium on the
side opposite to the circle is outlined by luminous pins so that
every movement can be seen distinctly from any part of the
room. The doors having been locked the observers now take their
seats in a horse-shoe formation, Baron von Schrenck occupying
the chair at the end of the circle away from Willy where he has
control of the apparatus and light regulator. The sitters join
hands, the one next Willy's controller keeping either contact
with the shoulder or knee or actually holding the controller's arm.
Thus the only hand free in the circle is Baron von Schrenck's
left, so that there is in reality a sort of partial control of the
circle as well as of the medium. Lighting is obtained from red
electric lamps hanging in a chandelier over the side of the circle,
remote from the medium and shaded by a piece of cardboard.
The light is rather poor, but sufficient to see a white, handker-
chief lying on the ground at about three feet from the observers.
When everything is ready the white light is put out, the red
turned on and the seance commences.
Willy is not hypnotised but falls spontaneously into a trance a
few minutes after the white light is turned out. The trance
itself is of varying depths, being at first light and only occasionally
being very deep. The head falls forward, the hands offer no
resistance, and the feet remain still ; occasionally jerks and twists
of the arms which often occur while phenomena are in progress
are experienced, but I am not aware that any detailed physio-
logical investigations have been carried out as yet. During the
OCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 363
trance condition Willy usually speaks in a half whisper, controlled
by a personality calling herself
'
Minna
'
;
thus it is Minna to whom
questions are addressed and who gives instructions as to when the
red light is to be increased or diminished.
In order to describe to you the phenomena we observed I
shall take each sitting separately, and at the risk of some repeti-
tion try to give you a vivid idea of the seances.
At the first sitting, besides Baron von Schrenck, his wife and
ourselves, there were present the Baron's son and his wife, General
Peter and Herr Bartels, an artist. We were both present at the
fore-control, and Baron von Schrenck asked me to hold the hands
of the medium during the first part. I therefore sat opposite
the medium controlling his hands and placing my stockinged feet
upon his, whilst General Peter controlled the wrists. The luminous
bracelets and pins having been put on by the Baron, the lights
were turned out and the seance began. The medium, however,
being unused to me, and possibly imagining that my attitude
was hostile, did not go into trance, and nothing occurred. After
a short interval the sitting continued, the Baron's daughter-in-law
taking my place as controller. Before describing the resulting
phenomena I digress a moment to describe to you the method
adopted by Dr. von Schrenck in order to isolate the objects to
be moved. He employs a cage made of black gauze of close
mesh mounted on a black wooden framework. It measures roughly
.5 feet high, 2 feet 2 ins. wide and 3 feet 1 in. deep. There is
no separate floor, the sides and ends being brought flush with
the carpet, whilst over the top is flung a sheet of black cloth.
One end is
really a door swinging on linen hinges and, when
.shut, connected to the main framework with staples and padlocks.
In the door, extending practically from side to side, is an opening
in the gauze about 5J or 6 ins. in depth. This gauze cage is
placed in the circle, the end containing the opening away from the
sitters and opposite the curtains of the main cabinet, the side
nearest the medium being usually about three feet distant from
him. Within this gauze framework was placed a heavy four-
legged oblong oaken table, weighing approximately thirty-three
pounds and having a large luminous triangle of paper attached to
its surface towards that end facing the circle. Before the sitting
now under consideration this table had been placed in the gauze
enclosure, and now during the second part a rustling was heard
364 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
near the table as if the gauze walls were being brushed over with
a feather duster. Then some raps were heard on the table and
it began to creak and move slightly, finally rising once or twice
on what were presumably the two back legs, and then coming
down with a loud thud on the carpet. Dr. von Schrenck then
placed through the slit in the gauze a clockwork musical box on
the table at the back near the gauze door. We had previously
examined this instrument and found it of ordinary construction
and apparently quite unprepared. A small projecting and easily
movable lever started and stopped the mechanism, whilst winding
was accomplished by a longer lever with a lateral movement, an
operation requiring two hands, since the spring was too strong to
allow of its being wound up without a downward pressure being
exerted at the same time on the top of the box. This apparatus,
without being fully wound, was placed on the table and after a
few moments it began to play. Dr. von Schrenck then said that
it would stop if asked to do so, and thereupon several of the
sitters, including ourselves, tried the experiment, the result being
that the box in every case obeyed the commands given by the
sitters. A small hand-bell with a luminous band round the lower
part of the handle was placed by Dr. von Schrenck near the
curtains of the cabinet and about two feet from the medium. In
a few moments it was seen to move and the luminous band was
now and then obscured as if some solid object were handling it.
Soon it rose vertically into the air to the height of, I should say,
three and a half to four feet and remained suspended, then began
to swing from side to side, ringing loudly, being finally thrown to-
wards the sitters and falling close to my chair. This ended the
second part, and we all, including the medium, adjourned to the
ante-room for general conversation.
For the third part a new arrangement of the seance room was
made by Baron von Schrenck. The gauze cage was removed and
about one and a half feet from the curtains of the cabinet, equi-
distant from either end, was placed a small low table upon which
was a heavily shaded red electric lamp. The light was such that
a hand placed near it could be clearly seen when in a line with
the lamp, and the downward rays from the lamp enabled us to
see the surface of a small low wicker table, upon which was laid
a sheet of luminous cardboard and a luminous bracelet, which was
placed near the centre lamp. This small table was at least four
OCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 3G5
feet from the medium, the bracelet being placed on the side of
the table nearest to him. The table soon began to tilt and was
then completely levitated to the height of about a foot, finally
falling to the floor. This being again placed in position, the
bracelet was suddenly twisted to the ground and then rose in the
air and floated about at the height of anything from one to three
feet. It was noticeable how when being levitated, a part or
parts of the bracelet were obscured, showing that a something had
hold of it and was responsible for its movements.
Another experiment was attempted which also proved exceed-
ingly successful. The Baron placed a white handkerchief on the
ground near the back curtains and almost opposite the lamp.
It was soon seen to move on the floor and then rose up as if
supported by two fingers, remaining suspended for a few seconds,
directly behind the lamp and clearly visible. Bobbing up and down
rapidly several times it finally collapsed on the carpet. There
then appeared in the neighbourhood of the medium a luminous
arm-like shape with a tapering point. The other observers said that
this was an arm and hand, claiming to see the fingers, but neither
of us were able to see this clearly either at this seance or at
the succeeding ones. After the disappearance of the hand the
medium again went into Dr. von Schrenck's study for the post-
control, at which we were present and which proved satisfactory.
At the conclusion of the sitting, and after having left Dr. von
Schrenck, we discussed the phenomena and found that we agreed
fully that the medium could not possibly have produced normally
the effects we had observed, and secondly, that if produced fraudu-
lently a confederate must be assumed to be responsible. The
possibility of a confederate was further strengthened on account
of the nature of the phenomena. Certain manifestations that we
witnessed were strongly suggestive of what confederacy of a
certain kind might accomplish, and although it appeared incon-
ceivable that under the conditions obtaining at the seance a
confederate could gain entrance and produce fraudulent phenomena
in Baron von Schrenck's own laboratory, we determined, in order
to meet criticism, to make a thorough examination of the seance
room should the Baron permit us to do so. Accordingly, on the
morning of May 31st we visited Dr. von Schrenck, and he im-
mediately gave permission, although with some amusement, which
we all shared, for a thorough inspection of the room. The
366 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1022.
cabinet was first taken down and the walls behind examined.
They were very dusty, and evidently the cabinet, being a fixture,
had not been disturbed for some time. The pictures were still
on the walls, and the space behind each was examined. The
rooms adjacent to the seance room were then visited, the walls,
ceilings and floors inspected without finding anything which gave
rise to the slightest suspicion.
For the next sitting, therefore, we asked merely for two favours.
The first was that the door P should be bolted, locked, sealed
and signed by ourselves, and secondly, that one of us should be
allowed to remain in the seance room from the time that the
seance room was opened until the end. This was readily agreed
to, and at the appointed time the same day the sitters assembled
in the ante-room. They comprised ourselves and the Baronr
the Prince and Princess of Parma, Professor Zimmer, Professor
Gruber and Dr. Lebrecht. We first went into the seance room,
sealed the door and examined everything again. Mr. Price
stayed in the room whilst Baron von Schrenck, Willy, one of the
sitters and myself went into the study for the fore-control. As
on this occasion I had asked the Baron to blacken the handle
of the bell, particular attention was paid to the question whether
any patch of black was observable on the medium before the
sitting. He having washed his hands under our supervision,
the tights were put on and we all went into the seance room.
The medium made no objection to my controlling his hands,
Professor Gruber holding his wrists. The luminous bracelets,
pins and general arrangements were as before ;
the lights being
out, the medium went into trance almost at once, his head
hanging down almost into my lap. After what seemed only
a few minutes rustlings were heard in the gauze cage and the
whole structure was pulled round towards the medium. The
large table then began to rise and thump on the floor, and the
movements were so violent that the control declared that a rent
had been made in the gauze, which was later found to be the
case. Loud raps sounded on the table and when the musical
box was placed on it the playing began almost at once, and then
started and stopped at command. It was also apparently wound
up, indicating two forces at work. The bell was placed near the
curtains and soon rose into the air, was rung loudly and then
thrown with some force on to my lap.
OCT., 1922.
Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 367
The first part then ended and all but Mr. Price and myself
retired to the ante-room. The blackening of the bell had been
of little use, since Dr. Lebrecht, who was sitting next me, had
removed it and thus the smears on the handle were of little value.
In the second part I continued the control, Dr. Lebrecht taking
Prof. Gruber's place, the luminous band and arm-shape being again
seen ;
and in the third part phenomena took place similar to
those which had occurred in the first sitting. I changed my
position and sat next Dr. von Schrenck, who, having placed the
shaded red lamp in position, put the little table with the luminous
cardboard and bracelet upon it, just in front of us and directly
under the lamp. We soon heard a rubbing on the carpet like a
crawling animal. Then the table began to rock, rose about two
feet into the air, passed me and fell with a crash almost at the
feet of Mr. Price. On its being replaced, Baron von Schrenck
and myself attempted to hold it down, he with his left hand and
right holding mine, I with my right hand still holding the sitter
on the other side. The table however resisted our efforts, was
drawn towards the medium and then finally stopped, the beading
at the top edge nearest the medium being pulled completely away
and the nails wrenched out. Having been again placed in
position the bracelet was twitched off and thrown at the sitters.
A white handkerchief was placed on the table with one end
dangling over on the side nearest the medium, the distance being
about four and a half to five feet. I held the end on the table
and the other free end was seized and pulled, the sensation being
as if a hand had hold of the other end and was pulling it. Baron
von Schrenck then suggested that we should hold up the luminous
board about four feet from the ground, the luminous side away
from the medium. We did so, and within a few seconds I felt
sharp thumps and blows against the surface nearest the medium.
It was as if a small hand within a boxing glove were delivering
the blows, the board being almost knocked out of our hands.
When the board was replaced on the table Dr. von Schrenck
suggested that the end of the rapping structure might show
itself against the surface of the luminous card. This was done,
but very rapidly, and all that could be seen was a black pointed
projection similar to what the first three fingers of a hand would
appear if
they were for a few seconds over a luminous sheet.
At the conclusion of the seance the seals were examined and
368 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
found intact, and an inspection of the room showed nothing
unusual. The post-control, at which I was again present, proved
negative, and we were unable to discover any soot marks on the
medium's hands or elsewhere.
The third sitting took place on Friday, June 2nd, at 9.25 p.m.
There were present besides ourselves and the Baron, Professors
Bekker, Gruber and Kluge, General Peter, Drs. Marimowski and
Lebrecht. The fore-control was superintended by Dr. von Schrenck,
Professor Bekker and myself. We obtained the Baron's consent
to try whether a dish of flour could be touched and an impression
obtained, without informing the medium what had been planned.
Willy was therefore asked to wash his hands thoroughly and the
tights were examined for any white marks which might have been
there accidentally. The control during the sitting was varied.
I did not control the medium myself, this being done by General
Peter and Professor Bekker in the first part and by Dr. Lebrecht
and Dr. Marimowski in the second, but the luminous bracelets
and pins enabled the circle to see him during the whole of the
sitting. The phenomena were more or less the same as before.
Mr. Price said that three times he felt a steady stream or draught
of distinctly cold air blowing on his left, a sensation also experi-
enced by Dr. Lebrecht, who was sitting next to him. The bell
was levitated and rung loudly and the large table tipped up
inside the cage so that it fell forward on to the sitters, straining
the gauze and almost breaking it. The white handkerchief was
placed on the floor and was levitated as if
by two stumps placed
beneath it ;
the small table was also levitated, and resisted Dr.
von Schrenck's and Professor Bekker's effort to hold it, being
finally broken in two places. At the conclusion of the sitting the
flour was found to be touched in two places, but the spots were
very small, and during the post-control a cursory examination of
the medium revealed no trace of flour. This was the final sitting,
and on the following Sunday morning we left Munich and returned
to London.
In the preceding account of the phenomena occurring with
Willy Sch. I have not attempted to give you any scientific or
detailed survey. The main object of our visit was to determine
whether, in our opinion, the phenomena might reasonably be
attributed to supernormal agency. We made no elaborate tests
OCT., 1922. Physical Phenomena observed at Munich. 369
or measurements, beyond making sure that the medium himself
was not producing the phenomena normally. Although the post-
control and fore-control would not have been in the least suffi-
cient to prevent the medium from bringing objects into the seance
room with him, the control during the sitting effectively prevented
any practical use being made by him of objects thus introduced,
even if it be assumed that such objects were capable of producing
the phenomena, which is not the case. Confederacy alone, there-
fore, had to be eliminated, and this we tried to do at the second
sitting. The last refuge for the sceptic is that the seance room
itself has been skilfully prepared with trap-doors and other open-
ings which in spite of diligent search we failed to discover. As
this naturally implies that the investigators themselves connive
at the fraud, it is an hypothesis that we can scarcely entertain
with patience. The conclusion, therefore, at which we ourselves
have arrived, is that it is reasonable to suppose that the phe-
nomena are in reality caused by supernormal agencies, the nature
of those agencies being unknown.
In conclusion I would remind you that this case stands almost
alone in the history of mediumship. With Palladino, the control
was difficult, and phenomena usually occurred within a short
distance from her, except on certain memorable occasions. With
Eva C. the control is even more difficult, especially as the quantity
and magnitude of the phenomena tend to diminish in proportion
to the strictness of that control. With Kathleen Goligher in
Belfast, Dr. Crawford attempted the well-nigh hopeless task of
controlling seven mediums, finally ending by controlling one, and
her ineffectually. With Linda Gazzera the control was even
more difficult than with Eva C., and with Kluski as difficult as
with Linda Gazzera. Indeed, I cannot remember any medium
who submits to such a control as does Willy Sch. No knowledge
of deception is really necessary as long as he sits for his present
phenomena and not for teleplasm. Held as he is by two
persons and outlined by luminous pins, escape is impossible and
useless were it possible. No friends of the medium are present,
the sitters comprising either savants or personal friends of Dr.
von Schrenck. The most powerful phenomena occur inside a
gauze cage, the only side opening to which is away from the
medium and the sitters. The phenomena rarely occur near the
medium and are sometimes five feet distant from him. Con-
370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1022.
federacy alone is possible and that theory involves us in greater
difficulties than in accepting the manifestations as genuine. The
sceptic's argument as to his inability to discover tricks does not
meet the case. It would meet it were Willy to sit for teleplasm,
as Eva does, and the fore and post control were as they were
when I was present. But held as Willy is he cannot possibly
produce these telekinetic phenomena normally. If the hands
were just laid on the controller's hands, substitution would be
easy, if the arms were invisible. But the wrists are always
visible with the luminous bracelets, and the legs would be useless
even if
they were not controlled. If the agency of the medium
is excluded the only other hypotheses are hallucination, con-
federacy or collusion on the part of the investigators, sitters or
others. In the Journal for November, 1894, Sir Oliver Lodge
dealt with similar objections in his report on the experiments at
the He Roubaud. Collusion, confederacy and simple lying were
all examined and shown to be untenable. Although in the case
of Willy Sch. the control is probably simpler and more effective,
the same hypotheses of collusion and confederacy will have to
be met and faced. The first is being partially refuted by Baron
von Schrenck by the device of inviting a large number of different
savants to see the phenomena for themselves and comment thereon.
The second will be met later by transferring the sittings to new
quarters, probably to the University of Munich. Doubtless other
objections will be raised and will be dealt with as they appear.
However monstrous these phenomena may appear to those persons
who are not acquainted with the mass of evidence now adduced
in support of their reality, to ignore them is
impossible for the
scientific man. In the case of the medium Willy Sch., the oppor-
tunity is presented of again examining phenomena previously
recorded as occurring with other mediums, under conditions which
scarcely ever obtain in mediumistic work.
ON THE MARKING OF TEST PLATES BY PREVIOUS
EXPOSURE.
BY SIR OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.
WITHOUT explicit reference to any recent controversy, I have
to report certain facts concerning the marking of plates, which
may be instructive to future experimenters.
OCT., 1922. On the Marking of Test Plates. 371
From July 26th to 28th, 1922, Dr. Allerton S. Cushman, of
Washington, D.C., visited my laboratory, bringing with him
two sealed packets of quarter-plates put up and prepared by
the Imperial Rapid Company, each plate said to be marked
in one corner with dots by x-ray exposure in that Company's
laboratory : his object being to see if that method of marking
was quite reliable. I gather from a letter which I have since
received from the Company that they agree it is capable of
improvement. Nevertheless, I record the result of the tests
made by myself and Dr. Cushman, with the help of my
assistant, Mr. E. E. Robinson.
Visibility of the Marks.
Each packet on being opened was found to contain four
plates, and on two successive bright mornings we exposed the
eight plates, giving a different exposure to each, the sitters
on both occasions being in a room with a North light such
that with Rapid plates about five or ten seconds would be a
natural exposure to give. But we wanted to see what would
be the effect of over-exposure, since it seemed likely that the
previously exposed spots would be the first portion to become
over-exposed, and that accordingly they would be liable to get
reversed with excessive exposure, and liable to vanish with
moderate over-exposure.
That is
exactly what happened. The exposures we gave
were :
5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 seconds respectively. On
the first three plates the spots were visible on the negative
as dark spots, in fact were quite normal, though they were
most conspicuous on the plate exposed for only 5 seconds.
On the long exposed plates the spots were reversed, and were
visible as light spots. On the plates exposed for 15 and 20
seconds the x-rayed spots had passed through zero on their
way to reversal, and were quite invisible, except one on the
screened and unexposed extreme edge of the plate. Nor could
they be detected on the prints.
Question of Uniformity.
To see how far such plates each set presumably cut from
one large sheet might vary in thickness, I weighed the plates
carefully to the nearest milligramme, that being the best mode
372 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., 1922.
of ascertaining their thickness with precision, since they were
all of the same area and specific gravity. The weights came
out as follows :
No. 1. 30.173 grammes. No. 5. 28.826 grammes.
2. 29.581 6. 30.710
3. 30.794 7. 30.772
4. 29.600 8. 28.837
thus showing that there was a variation of about 2 grammes
in 30, or say 6 per cent, maximum difference of thickness in
this set.
To avoid misunderstanding I must assert that I do not put
these facts forward as contesting Mr. Price's conclusion con-
cerning the nature of the plate on which an extra was obtained
during his visit to 59 Holland Park. I have reason to believe
that this plate was not one of the set which he had taken
with him ; though as to the manner and reason of the sub-
stitution I have no special information.

IN these three articles one of our American Associates summarises
the American case-law relating to mediums and persons dealing
with them, with numerous references to the law prevailing in
England and other countries on the same subject.
In this country persons supposed to possess supernormal powers
have never received very sympathetic treatment from the lawyers.
A few centuries ago you were punished for having occult powers,
however much you protested you hadn't :
now, however much you
may protest you have them, the law knows quite well you haven't,
and calls you a rogue and vagabond. In America, according to
Mr. Blewett Lee, they are more lenient, and he adds :
"
It is
hard to see how our English brethren have, on the whole, had
any better results from their more vigorous policy than we have
had in America from leaving the matter pretty much alone." If
the author's suggestion is that fraudulent mediums are quite as
common in this country as in America, we think the weight of
evidence is against him. W. H. S.

THE POLTERGEIST CASE AT LEDAIG, ARGYLESHIRE.
IN January, 1920, a series of disturbances were reported as
occurring in a small cottage near Ledaig, a hamlet in Bender-
loch, Argyleshire. The alleged phenomena appeared to be
connected with two of the children of the family of seven,
who lived with their father and mother in this remote country
district. The two children, Malcolm and Ian M ,
were
about thirteen and nine years of age respectively when the
manifestations commenced.
These consisted in rappings, the breaking of tables and
crockery, the levitation of the children themselves, and similar
phenomena. Several persons visited the family, and soon the
manifestations changed somewhat in character, becoming more
orderly and easy to control. The children began to give
sittings to investigators, without asking any remuneration
whatever for their services.
The case was investigated by some members of the Glasgow
Society for Psychical Research, who, upon two occasions, had
the children to Glasgow, and held a series of sittings. The
results were not particularly satisfactory, and although some
of the Committee believed the table movements obtained to
be supernormal, there was no general agreement in the matter.
Towards the summer of 1922 further developments took
place.
"
Voices
"
had been heard for a considerable time,
but the
"
communicators
"
were shy, avoiding strangers and
any investigation. Later, however, they became stronger and
Malcolm became a " direct voice medium," being controlled by
an entity calling herself
"
Janet," or in greater detail Janet
MacGregor, late of Kinloch. This person was supposed to
have been a servant at one time in the M 's house at
Ledaig, but she was not able to give many details about her-
self. The younger child, Ian, then became controlled by
another entity called Dundas Campbell, who professed to have
lived in Madrid. According to the investigators' reports the
376 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1922.
voices did not in the least resemble those of the children,
and at times made prophecies which turned out correct and
spoke in languages unknown to the boys.
At the invitation of certain members of the Council of the
Glasgow S.P.R., one of whom generously gave financial aid,
the Research Officer visited Ledaig at the end of September,
remaining there from September 18th to the 28th. He was
accompanied by his wife, and seven sittings in all were attended.
The
"
phenomena
"
consisted in voices, direct writing on paper
placed between Malcolm and Ian, raps, tips of the table and
levitation of Malcolm. All the phenomena were of the most
puerile possible character, and no evidence whatever was
obtained that the children have even the weakest mediumistic
power. When control conditions were imposed the phenomena
ceased absolutely and nothing occurred. The performances do
not warrant any detailed description in these pages. A full
report is in preparation for the Society's files, where it may
be seen on application.
TWO BOOK-TESTS.
I.
The following report of a book-test has been received from
Mrs. Drummond, as we will call her here. A report on some
incidents which occurred at sittings held by Mrs. Drummond
with Mrs. Leonard has already been printed in the Journal
(Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 128 ff.).
The peculiarity of the present case is that the first state-
ment about the test was obtained at one of the Rev. C.
Drayton Thomas's sittings, and the book was in his house. On
the page originally mentioned Mrs. Drummond could find nothing
relevant, but through table-tilting at home she obtained in a
message purporting to come from her husband a correction of
the page. Not only did this second page prove relevant, but
at a sitting Mrs. Drummond had with Mrs. Leonard just after
she had obtained the correction at home, but before she knew
of the relevance of the page thus given, a reference was made
to the same topic as was referred to in the corrected book-test.
Thus there appears to be a consecutive train of thought
NOV., 1922. Two Book-Trf.
running through (a) a statement at Mr. Drayton Thomas's
sitting, (6) a statement received by Mrs. Drummond in her
own home, (c) a statement made in Mrs. Drummond's sitting
with Mrs. Leonard. All the original letters on this case which
passed between Mrs. Drummond and Mr. Drayton Thomas
have been seen by us, but we only print below such extracts
as seem necessary to bring out the evidence.
Mr. Drayton Thomas's sitting with Mrs. Leonard, at which
the first statement about the book-test for Mrs. Dnimmond
was made, took place on December 9, 1921. On December 17,
and again (more fully) on January 10, 1922, Mr. Thomas wrote
to Mrs. Drummond giving particulars of the matter contained
upon page 3 of the book in his own library which he had
identified as being referred to in the test, this book being
Via Crucis. On January 17, 1922, Mrs. Drummond wrote to
Mr. Thomas as follows :
I thank you very much for your letter and for copying out
p. 3, but I cannot find anything apposite in a personal way.
I have read the poem over several times. I asked my husband
about it at home and he said the book was right but the page
was wrong ;
it should have been p. 8. It seems so very difficult
to put a test right when it has gone wrong that I have not
much hope of p. 8, but if, and when, you have time you will
look it up, I will be very much obliged. I go to Mrs. Leonard
this afternoon, but thought I would send you this note before
my sitting. . . .
On January 24, 1922, Mr. Thomas sent Mrs. Drummond a
passage from p. 8 of Via Crucis, thus :
THE SPIRITUAL ATHLETE.
Part 2. The Conflict.
Now turn we to another sport
Fraught with grave truths of like import,
Where the well-practised pugilist
Copes with a meet antagonist,
And labours with adroitest art
To wound some vulnerable part.
378 Journal of Society /or Psychical Research. NOV., 1922.
Dear [Mrs. Drummond],
I have above typed out page 8 of Via Crucis. It
struck me that the last lines about boxing might possibly link on
to some personal memories ;
indeed I have some recollection of
your mentioning something of that kind in connexion with your
son. . . .
(Signed) C. D. THOMAS.
In this passage Mrs. Drummond found a striking relevance
to memories connected with her husband and her son, the two
purporting communicators at her sittings with Mrs. Leonard.
Her statement on this point and in regard to the statement
made at her own sitting on January 17, 1922, was contained
in a letter to Mrs. Salter, thus :
February 11, 1922.
... I now give you an extract from my sitting with Mrs.
Leonard, 17th January, 1922, at 3 o'clock.
Mr. Arthur [Mrs. Drummond's husband] says
"
perhaps you
can remember afterwards there was one pursuit of lan's
[Mrs. Drummond's son] that I had been rather proficient at
when I was young, but had dropped in later life." He had
not done it since he was very young, not done much, but
known to be good. It was something Ian thought lie had
shone in. Ian thinks he was awful clever, and he was too.
Mr. Arthur had done it, but was not able to go on, when he
was a young man. They would like you to remember after.
// Mr. Arthur had kept on,
"
perhaps he would have been
better than I was, Mum. He might have been, but he didn't
keep on." Feda don't think Ian thinks that really, but he
is trying to be polite.
I was rather surprised at this mention of boxing, as they had
already mentioned it at other sittings. ... My husband, when he
was at College, and perhaps just before he went, took up boxing
and was considered very good, but had to give it up, as he
couldn't afford the time. Feda's remarks don't apply to shooting,
fishing, golf, tennis, or anything else he did. Ian, our son, was
a very fine boxer, and won the Public Schools Boxing Cup after
only a few months' training. When he went to New College,
Oxford, he was made Captain of the Boxing Club and won
everything he went up for, except once, and he certainly
"
shone."
That wouldn't apply to any other pursuit, though he was quite
NOV., 1922. Two Book-Tests.
good at most games. To me it is all quite clear, and the last
verse of
"
The Spiritual Athlete
"
is singularly apposite, as he has
spoken through Feda of boxing with his father, and finding him
quite a good opponent, etc. . . .
I have never read Via Crucis, nor had the book in my
hand, and, as far as I know, have never seen it. I have looked
through the books in this house, and it isn't here.

We have also received the following report of a book-test
from Miss H. A. Dallas. The letter from Sir Oliver Lodge
from which she quotes appeared in the March Journal (Vol.
XX., p. 249). Since the test was obtained at a
"
table
sitting," it is, of course, possible that Miss Dallas's friend,
S. G., may have had some unconscious recollection of the
position of the books in the shelf. But it is to be observed
(see below) that not long before the sitting the books had
been re-arranged by another person. The statements made for
the identification of the passage were quite definite, and the
passage indicated was, Miss Dallas tells us, extremely apposite
to the circumstances in which the test was given.
Miss Dallas's report is as follows :
March 31, 1922.
In the March issue of the S.P.R. Journal Sir Oliver Lodge
says :
"
The only way in which book-tests bear upon the question
of survival is as to the matter selected and the manner in which
it is introduced and applied to the right people. This part of
the evidence remains still strong in my judgment, quite apart
from the mere power of reading."
The first book-test I received seems to me valuable from this
standpoint ;
therefore I send the record written from notes taken
at the time.
On Sept. 8, 1917, I visited Mrs. Leonard in London with a
friend who was at that time living in the country. Mrs. Leonard
had never been in her house, and, I believe, she had never seen
my friend before this date.
I use the initials
"
S. G." for my friend, and I indicate by
brackets when we guessed the conclusion of words. We had
asked for a

NOV., 1922. Two Book-Tests,
Other matter followed not connected with this test. On return-
ing that evening to my friend's house we found that the 4th book
on the 3rd shelf of the large dining-room bookcase was a small
darkly bound book which had belonged to her mother; it was ;m
old book which formerly belonged to her mother's father, so it
was distinctively her mother's property, not her father's. It was
a hymn book, and on page 12 was a hymn which S. G. used to
repeat to her mother, when she was a child. There were five
shelves, so the 3rd was the same when we counted from top to
bottom and from bottom to top. There were two smaller book-
cases on either side which I thought were joined to the large
one ;
but I found that this was not so. The big case \\ as
separate ;
it was this bookcase, evidently, which we were t >
search.
S. G. took out the 4th book on the other shelves of the big
case, but none of these were her mother's books. She did not
remember that any book of her mother's was in that room ;
and when it had been "
spring cleaned," she had not put back
the books herself, so she had no idea that this book was there.
The verse half way down was appropriate to the anxious time
we were then passing through, encouraging us to trust in Divim-
Wisdom and Love.
This is the verse we read half-way down the page :
"
E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
Will His changeless goodness prove ;
From the mist His brightness gleameth ;
God is wisdom, God is love."
My friend S. G. has passed on, otherwise I know she would
confirm the accuracy of this record.

THE WERE-TIGERS OF THE ASSAM HILLS.
BY C. P. MILLS, I.C.S.
Paper read on March 7th, 1922, at a Private Meeting of the
Society.
I AM going to confine my remarks this afternoon to that section
of the hill-folk of Assam which is known by the general name
of Nagas. These people inhabit the mass of hills lying between
382 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1022.
Assam and Burma, and comprise a number of tribes which speak
different languages and show considerable diversity of custom.
They are of mixed origin, and it is impossible to say with certainty
what elements have entered into their composition, but they
certainly contain a considerable Mongolian strain. Though those
of them who are administered at all are subjects of the Indian
Empire, I want you to realise that they are totally unlike the
Indians with which most people are familiar. They are wild
and picturesque savages, and confirmed head-hunters save where
they are under our control. Their dress is
scanty and their
ornaments magnificently barbaric, reminding one far more of New
Guinea or some South Sea Island than of Hindustan.
But I do not want to waste your time with a general de-
scription of their dress and habits, but to draw your attention
to a peculiar belief held by them. It varies in form somewhat
in the different tribes, but roughly speaking it is that certain
men, and more rarely women, have the habit of projecting their
soul into a leopard or tiger, retaining meanwhile their human
form, and that these persons are so intimately connected with
the animal selected that an injury to it involves an injury to
the owner of the soul occupying it. I have not found any account
of an exactly similar belief elsewhere in the world, and I should
be very glad if
any one here can give, me any other examples.
Mr. J. H. Hutton read a paper on this subject before the Royal
Anthropological Institute which was published in their Journal for
January-June, 1920. He also gave a full account, with examples,
of this belief in his monograph on
"
The Sema Nagas," which
Macmillan and Co. published last year. I have made great use
of this account in order to refresh my memory, for I did not
come home expecting to be asked to read a paper. But I have
some personal knowledge of the matter, having acted for three
and a half years as Subdivisional Officer of Mokokchung, the area
where Mr. Hutton collected most of his material. Many of the
more notorious leopard-men of the hills are our mutual acquaint-
ances.
I spoke just now of a man "
projecting his soul
"
into a tiger
or leopard, and I must say a few words on the Naga theory of
the soul. He believes in what Sir J. G. Frazer calls the
"
ex-
ternal soul." A man's soul may easily become detached from his
body. It wanders in dreams, or it may be captured by an evil
NOV., 1922. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hills. 383
spirit, in which case the owner becomes ill till it can be induced
to return. If, of course, the soul goes on right away to the
Land of the Dead, the owner dies, but the temporary loss of one's
soul is a trivial matter. I should say that the average Naga
loses his soul at least once a year. The proper ceremonies will
induce it to return.
You may ask why tigers and leopards should be the usual
recipients of a man's soul. The probable reason is the peculiarly
close connection believed to exist between tigers and men.
According to Naga folk-lore a man, a spirit and a tiger were
the three children of one mother. The man preferred his meat
cooked, the spirit just dried his in the smoke, and the tiger ate
his raw. These differences led to everlasting squabbles and
eventually the family split up. But tigers are still held in great
respect, and among the Angami Nagas, for instance, if a tiger be
killed mourning is proclaimed in the village for the death of an
elder brother. Further, I ought to mention that leopards and
tigers are hardly distinguished. One generic term is used for
both, words meaning
"
little
"
or
"
big
"
being added if the
speaker wishes to be precise.
I come at last to my main subject. I have said that the
various tribes hold rather different beliefs about leopard-men (or
tiger-men, as the case may be). Among the Chang Nagas you
have one type. Here it is always the tiger which is associated
with this belief, and one whole clan the Hakyung clan consists
of tiger men and women. The story goes that at the time of
the Universal Deluge all men and animals were crowded on to
the tops of the highest mountains. Tigers claimed victims from
all clans except the Hakyung clan, who thereupon acknowledged
themselves to be the adopted children of the tiger people, and
have been tiger-folk ever since. Among the Lhota Nagas you
find another very distinct type of this belief. Here every medicine
man is ipso facto a leopard or tiger-man. But his soul is not
believed to enter into the animal, which is merely a sort of
"
familiar." But a medicine-man will suffer from any injury
inflicted on his
"
familiar." The ordinary type of the belief is
found among the Sema Nagas, and as leopards and tiger-men
are commonest in this tribe all I am about to say refers to them,
unless I definitely say that I am taking examples from elsewhere.
It is sometimes said that the affliction is catching, and that a
384 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1022,
man can become a leopard-man by habitually consorting with a
leopard-man. It usually happens, however, that the symptoms-
occur in a man willy-nilly for no apparent reason. It should be
clearly understood that no one wants to become a leopard-man.
It is a most infernal nuisance. For one thing it is
exceedingly
fatiguing, for the man is exhausted by the activities of his leopard.
For another thing, leopard-men are always getting into trouble.
Suppose I am a leopard-man. My leopard goes and kills some-
one's pig. The owner of the pig rather naturally comes and
abuses me. Not only that, but, if he can, he will shoot or
spear rny leopard, in which case I shall die.
It is said that in some cases a man's soul will remain absent
in his leopard for two or three days at a time. In such cases
the man will go about his usual business, but is lethargic and
incapable of speaking coherently. Usually, however, his soul only
leaves him during sleep and returns to him in the morning.
It is said that while his leopard is hunting the man's limbs
twitch. Or he may even become violent, and a case is known
of a man biting his wife very severely. One man complained to
me that when his leopard killed he used to wake up with a taste
of raw meat in his mouth, and find pieces of flesh between his
teeth. It is strongly held that the man has knowledge of what
his leopard does, and in the morning can direct searchers to the
kills for the owners of animals killed are naturally anxious to
save what they can from the wreck. As an illustration I will
tell you some stories of Zhetoi, a Sema youth of Sheyepu village,
whom I know well. He suddenly, to his great distress, became
a leopard-man in the early spring of last year, and I had a
long talk with him before I came home on leave. One night
his leopard killed a calf. The owner searched everywhere for it
next day, but could not find the carcase. He accordingly asked
Zhetoi, who told him that the search party had been very near it,
but had missed it because his leopard had dragged it up into a
tree growing out from the hillside, and they had passed under
the tree without looking up. The search party returned to the
tree and found the carcase of the calf in the fork. On another
occasion, I was told, Zhetoi's leopard killed a pig at Sakhalu-
Nagami, a neighbouring village. Sakhalu, the chief of the village,
followed it up with his dogs. The dogs got far ahead and one
of them, did not come back. Sakhalu sent word to Zhetoi, who
NOV., 1922. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hill-.
was able to tell him exactly where his leopard had killed tin- dog.
This leopard became a perfect nuisance at Sakhalu-Nagami. and
Sakhalu spoke to me and to Zhetoi strongly on the su !]. t.
One day he collected the men of his village, and succeeded in
surrounding the leopard. While the hunt was in ]>n
message came from Zhetoi begging them to let the leopard escape
as its death would involve his own. On another occasion Sakhalu
had a shot at the leopard at dusk while it was trying to drag
off a pig. Early next morning a message came from Zhetoi to
say that he would be glad if Sakhalu would refrain from shooting
at him. It is to be noticed that Nagas do not travel at night,
so that it was very improbable indeed that there had been any
communication between the two villages from dusk to dawn.
One notes that Zhetoi seems to have been aware of what was
happening to his leopard during the day as well as at night,
when his soul was supposed to be in it. I questioned him closely,
but Zhetoi could not tell me how he was aware of the actions of
his leopard. He said he just knew. All tribes hold that the con-
nection between a leopard -man and his leopard is closest at the
dark of the moon. But some sort of connection is believed to
be continuous. Hence if
you can wound a man by \vounding
his leopard, you can impede the movements of a leopard which
you wish to hunt by tying up the man to whom it belongs. An
excellent example of this belief came to the notice of Mr. JECutton.
I will give his account of it. On one occasion the elders of a
large Aonaga village (Ungma) came to him when he was Sub-
divisional Officer of Mokokchung for permission to tie up a certain
man in the village while they hunted a leopard which had been
giving a great deal of trouble. The man in question, who was,
by the way, a Christian convert, also appeared to protest against
the action of the village elders. He said that he was very sorry
that he was a were-leopard, he didn't want to be one, and it
was not his fault, but seeing that he was one he supposed that
his leopard body must kill to eat, and if it did not both the
leopard and himself would die. He said that if he were tied up
the leopard would certainly be killed and he would die. To tie
him up and hunt the leopard was, he said, sheer murder. In the
end Mr. Hutton gave leave to the elders to tie the man up and
hunt the leopard, but told them that if the man died as a result
of killing the leopard, whoever had speared the animal would of
386 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1922.
course be tried and no doubt hanged for murder, and the elders
committed for abetment of the same. On this the elders unani-
mously refused to take advantage of Mr. Button's permission to
tie up the man.
One result, it is believed, of the intimate connection of a
leopard or tiger-man with his animal is that he can call it and
let others see it at will. I must confess that I have never
succeeded in
persuading anyone to do this for me. For one thing,
leopard-men hate being questioned about their failing. They are
ashamed of it, and very touchy on the point. They are nervous
too lest their leopard should be shot, with disastrous results to
themselves. But I have heard many stories from reliable infor-
mants of leopards being summoned at will. Mr. Hutton gives
several instances, and I have heard similar accounts. One day
some Aonagas from Susu who were sitting drinking at Ungrr
laughed at a leopard-man of the latter village. He told them that
as a proof of his powers he would cause them to see his leopard
at a certain point on their way home. They saw the leopard
sure enough at that very spot and got a good fright. Khusheli,
a Sema woman of Litsammi, is a well-known leopard-woman.
Her husband, a Sangtam Naga, did not believe in her powers, so
she convinced him by showing him her leopard. As he was
coming home one day a leopard appeared first in front of him
and then behind him on the path. He ran and the leopard
chased him up to the edge of the village. His wife laughed at
him when he arrived frightened and perspiring, and asked him
if he had seen a leopard. Mr. Hutton was able to obtain inde-
pendent accounts of a particularly good instance from the two
men concerned Inaho, chief of Melahomi, and Inato, chief of
Lumitsami. The former is a well-known tiger-man and an
acquaintance of mine. The latter died before I went to Mokok-
chung. While these two were travelling together down a jungle
path Inato persuaded Inaho to show him his tiger. Inaho there-
upon dropped behind and a tiger sprang out into the path in
front of Inato, who raised his gun and fired in the excitement of
the moment. Luckily he missed and the tiger jumped aside and
disappeared. But Inaho has never again taken the risk of
showing his tiger to anyone.
I have said that an injury to the leopard or tiger involves
an injury to the man to whom it belongs. Wounds are believed
NOV., i)2-j. The Were-Tigers of the Assam Hill*. 3s?
to appear on the human body corresponding to wounds on tin;
animal body. Kiyezu, chief of Kiyezu-Nagami, shows marks on
his leg which he says are the scars of wounds inflicted many
years ago by a sepoy of Wokha outpost on his leopard, /ukiya
of Kolhopu showed Mr. Hutton some fairly fresh marks above
his waist which he said corresponded to shot wounds received by
his leopard about two months previously. Sakhuto of Khuiyi also
showed Mr. Hutton a fairly fresh wound. It should be under-
stood that the wound on the human body does not app'-ar
simultaneously with that inflicted on the animal, but some days
later, when the man has learnt of the condition of his leopard or
tiger. This point is illustrated by an incident which occurred
in March, 1919, and of which I heard immediately afterwards.
While Mr. Hutton was in camp at a village called Melomi, one
of his Angami interpreters while wandering round with a gun met
a large tiger. He fired and wounded the animal, hitting it rather
far back. The beast got away, however. It was said, more in
jest than in earnest, that the tiger was really a man-tiger. This
came to the ears of Saiyi of Zumethi, a subordinate in the Civil
Works Department, but a tiger-man withal. He announced to his
friends that his tiger had been wounded, and took to his bed.
Three days later he was met by Nihu, head interpreter of Kohima,
being carried in to Kohima on a stretcher for treatment in the
Government hospital. Nihu, who is a most intelligent and entirely
reliable man, told me that he questioned and examined Saiyi, who
said that he was suffering terrible pains in the abdomen owing
to the wound inflicted on his tiger, and showed an inflamed
swelling on either side of the stomach, corresponding, of course, to
the entrance and exit holes of the bullet which had hit the tiger.
He eventually died in Kohima hospital.
In theory in Naga theory, I mean, a leopard or tiger man can
save his life if he can get another animal after his has been
killed. But I have never known an instance of this. The
unfortunate man always seems to die. I have mentioned Sakhuto,
chief of Khuivi ;
he came to his end in this way. Sakhalu of
Sakhalu-Nagami shot a leopard which was supposed to belong to
a man of Kukishe. Sakhuto of Khuivi said it was his, however,
and to show how firm was his belief he sickened and died a
fortnight later. Cowardly, mean-minded men are said sometimes
to have a leopard-cat for their familiar instead of a leopard or
388 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. NOV., 1922.
tiger. A man of Lizutomi was returning home one night when
he heard that his leopard-cat had been killed at Aichisagami, a
village some miles away. He fell down and died on the spot.
I should like to tell one more story which is now part of the
history of Mokokchung. It is particularly interesting because Mr.
Hutton was on the spot and able to take down the facts, which
he records in his monograph on the Sema Nagas. The big Ao
village of Ungma managed to ring a family party of tigers which
had been killing their cattle. Mr. Hutton was sent for and went
to take part in the hunt. The old tiger broke out early and
got away. At this point there arrived Chekiye of Lukammi, a
man who had the reputation of being a tiger-man, though he
would never admit it. The tigress broke and mauled the man
next to Chekiye, but was turned.
Chekiye made no attempt to spear the tigress when she broke
within a few feet of him. When remonstrated with he said,
"
I
did not like to spear her as I thought she was probably a friend
of mine." When she was eventually shot he said she was the
tiger of a woman of Murromi, a village which the Semas say lies
far to the east, and where all the men and women are tiger-folk.
Probably it is mythical, but the country in question has never
been explored. Meanwhile three miles away at Mokokchung an
Ao named Imtong-Lippa of Changki was giving a curious exhibition
in the house of one of the hospital servants. He became
"
possessed
"
and raved and said he was one of the tigers which
were being hunted. He described the hunt as it was going on
and said that one of the tigers had been wounded, but that he
himself had only been hit by sticks thrown by the beaters.
He rolled up a mat and laid it on the floor to represent the
fence which the beaters had built to assist them to drive, ac-
cording to the usual Naga method. He himself jumped six times
over the mat. drank about a small bucketful of water, and ate
ginger. (Among the Semas if a were-tiger is being hunted the
relations of the man concerned sometimes stuff him with ginger
in order to make his animal more active and better able to
escape.) Imtong-Lippa eventually said that three tigers, including
himself, had escaped, but that a tigress, whom like Chekiye he
identified with a transfrontier woman, had been speared in the
side and had been left behind in the beat and would die. As a
matter of fact four tigers (though Chekiye said there were six)
were seen in the beat. Of these three escaped and the tigress
was speared in the neck, failed to get out of the beat and was
shot. This account of Imtong-Lippa's performance was taken
down by Mr. Hutton from eyewitnesses the same evening.
It is no series of carefully regulated experiments that I have been
expounding, but a few facts connected with a curious belief held
by a little-known people in a remote part of the world. I leave
you to form your own conclusions.

"
That the Committee of the B.C.P.S. having examined all the
documents and exhibits of the two anonymous packets received
by the S.P.R. in connection with the Price-Hope case, are
of opinion that the sealed packet of plates used at the experi-
ment on February 24th shows distinct signs that the maker's
paper wrapping has been tampered with. Also that the
sealing of the envelope in which Mr. Moger put the packet
of plates to send to the S.P.R. was ineffective in itself, and
was rendered useless as evidence owing to the fact that the
six seals had all been broken and damaged. To have carried
out the experiment satisfactorily the envelope should have
been opened by slitting it, in order that the seals might
have remained intact for the purpose of future examination.

CASES.
WE print below three incidents in which information was
obtained at sittings concerning matters about which the sitters
had no normal knowledge at the time.
I.
L. 1236.
For the striking incident which we print below it is not
possible now to obtain corroboration. Nevertheless we think
it worth while to put it on record here, because the sitter,
whom we will here call Mrs. Barker, has from time to time
furnished us with very good evidence obtained at her sittings
with Mrs. Leonard and we have reason to believe her a
thoroughly accurate and trustworthy recorder. Her motives
for desiring to be anonymous in this particular instance will
be readily understood. Mrs. Barker's account of the incident
was enclosed in a letter to Mrs. Salter, as follows :
April 1st, [1921].
... I am sending you an account of very good evidence which
I had in my first sittings with Mrs. Leonard. I have never
sent it before because I took no notes at the sittings. I was
quite new to investigation, and I am afraid my frame of mind
was such that I was only seeking for personal conviction. I
wrote an account of it afterwards and I believe what I send
you to be an accurate statement, but I cannot corroborate it
with my notes taken before the information was confirmed.
I told Miss Newton about it one day, and she said she would
like me to send it in nevertheless. The word
"
Kismet
"
coming
just in the way it did was really very remarkable. ... If you
think the enclosed is of value and wish to record it, I would
rather not have my name given. I could not have it discussed
by name, as I am quite sure you will understand.
[E. BARKER.]
MRS. BARKER'S STATEMENT CONCERNING SITTINGS WITH
MRS. LEONARD, JANUARY-FEBRUARY, 1916.
The circumstances were :
I received the official telegram to say that my husband had
been killed in Mesopotamia. T wrote to the India Office to ask
DEC., 1922. Ca
if
any details had been received as to whether he had 1 --n
killed instantly or had died of wounds.
The reply was that they had had no information beyond the
bare casualty list. No details could be given till the mails of
that date arrived.
I then cabled privately to the regiment to ask for details by
return cable. The telegram did not get beyond Basra for some
weeks.
From the above it will be seen that the information given
through Feda, as follows, could not have been known to any
person in England.
I went to Mrs. Leonard for the first two or three sittings
before the mail arrived. Mrs. Leonard was not then sought
after as she is now, and it was possible to get a sitting without
an introduction or appointment. I was entirely anonymous
to her and had no introduction, nor did I write for an appoint-
ment. I was just a passer-by who stopped at her door on chance
of getting a sitting. I gave no name either at the first or
subsequent sittings when I got the following information. I had
a wonderfully vivid sitting in which a great deal of private
matter was given unknown to others but known to me. [My
husband's] initials W. B. were given and then the following
facts concerning his death. They were unverifiable at the time,
as I have shown.
1. Feda said : "He is very anxious that you should know he
did not suffer. He was not killed instantly, but died about
three-quarters of hour after he was hit. But he was unconscious,
so he did not suffer. He says you will get this verified, for
he was carried to the rear and was buried. He was not
'
missing.'
or prisoner. You will get his things sent to you, his watch and
things he had on."
Verification. The General wrote to me that he was present
when my husband was carried in. He said he was not killed
on the spot, but died within the hour, during ^which time he was
unconscious, so he could not have suffered. He was buried the
same evening. His things were all sent to me, his watch and
the things he had on him, cigarette case, letters, etc.
2. At the next sitting Feda said :
"
He is particularly anxious
you should know he did not suffer. He is afraid there may be
a muddle in what is told to you. He was unconscious. He
396 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922.
had two wounds, one in the chest and one in the throat. (She
hesitated a good deal about the latter and then said :) Yes, Feda
is sure he says two. Chest and throat, but it was the wound
in the chest that killed him, his lung was pierced.
Verification. A letter was sent to me to see written by a
brother officer to a friend in which he said :
"
Colonel [Barker]
was shot in the chest and throat."
This officer was badly wounded in the head soon after and
had sun-stroke and has lost all memory of that time, so he
has been unable to tell me how he got this very definite informa-
tion. 1
3. The last point is particularly striking. I asked Feda if
he could tell her if he had time to know he was mortally wounded
before he became unconscious. She said :
"
Well, he just had
time to feel like a blow knock him over and he just said to himself
'Hallo, it's come then.' He says a foreign word, 'Kismet,' he
says,
'
Kismet.'
"
Verification. Three years later in December, 1919 one of
the officers of the regiment came home on leave for the first time
during the war. He came to see me and asked if I had any
questions I would like to ask him. I said I thought all that
was known had been written to me except one point which
I had never been able to clear up. Had my husband any
interval of consciousness during which he knew that he was
mortally wounded ? The Officer (Colonel B.) replied that when
my husband fell a native orderly ran to him. Col. B. questioned
the man afterwards (the regiment was advancing, so no officer
could stay to go to him at the moment). The orderly said the
Colonel just looked up and said
"
Kismet, carry me out," and
then became unconscious.
We think it worth while to put this incident on record
in spite of the fact that no contemporary record is available,
because quite apart from this incident we have reason for
believing that (a) Mrs. Barker is an unusually good witness
and (b) Colonel Barker is an unusually successful communi-
cator. It will be realised that it is quite impossible that
Mrs. Barker should have unintentionally given away the

very short period, which made it very difficult to get any first-hand infor-
mation or any definite details.
DEC., 1922. Cases. 397
relevant facts at her sittings, because they were entirely
unknown to her at the time.
We print below a statement from Mrs. Sidgwick
Mrs. Barker's accuracy as a witness :
QC(
The Editor has shown me the very interesting case she has
received from Mrs. Barker concerning her husband's death. It
is of course much to be regretted that no notes were taken at
the time and that no corroboration is available. I should like,
however, to say that Mrs. Barker is known to me personally and
also by correspondence about psychical matters, and that I regard
her as an excellent witness, careful, accurate, and with a clear
grasp of what constitutes good evidence. I think it unlikely
that her memory has played her false as to the closeness of
coincidence between Feda's statements and the facts afterwards
learnt. ELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWK K.
We also print a letter from Mrs. Barker in reply to a question
as to whether she could say when her notes of what had
occurred at the sittings with Mrs. Leonard were made, and
a corroborative statement from Mrs. Barker's sister-in-law, to
whom the statements made at the sittings were told before
any verification had been obtained.
Letter from Mrs. Barker.
^ ^ lm
I am sorry I cannot say exactly when I wrote down the
account of my first sittings with Mrs. Leonard. It was very
soon after getting the verification, but not before. I was so
much struck by the evidence that I was anxious to record for
my children, and so I am sure I wrote it very soon.
I kept the proof notes [of the report printed above] till
to-day,
as my sister-in-law Miss [Barker] was coming to stay with us
and I thought you might like to have a letter from her. She
is my husband's eldest sister. I was seeing her almost daily
at the time of his death and when these sittings took place.
She is
quite sure that she remembers my telling her these details
'before they were verified. E. BARKER.
Letter from Miss Barker.
Nov. 15th, 1922.
My sister-in-law has shown me your proof notes. I thought
perhaps you might like to know I was seeing her almost daily
398 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922-
at the time these sittings with Mrs. Leonard took place, and
we discussed them at once, and as far as I can remember what
she told me then exactly tallies with the account given in these
notes.
I remember her telling me about it most definitely before the
verification. L. E. [BARKER].

L. 1237.
The following case was sent to us by a Member of the Society
whom we will here call Mrs. Drummond ;
the incident occurred
at one of her sittings with Mrs. Leonard. Other incidents
from Mrs. Drummond's sittings have already been printed
in the Journal. (See, e.g., Jour. S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 128.)
We print first an extract from Mrs. Drummond's con-
temporary record of her sitting :
SITTING WITH MRS. LEONARD, June 14, 1921.
FEDA. Have you got some money in a drawer ?
MRS. D. I don't think so.
PEDA. Are you sure ? It's rather important. Ian [the
supposed communicator, Mrs. Drummond's son] says :
"
Mum, I don't want to tell you a prophecy about
losing it, not that at all." He thought he saw a
coin in a drawer, quite lately, but he says : "Be
careful, Mum, there was such an important date
*
on it. I couldn't see exactly, but this date means
something to me and to Mum. It is important,
and especially appropriate to me and Mum. Look
for it. It is with other things, it isn't all alone.
Mum darling, it is an important date. I knew it
in a very personal sense too ; you will apply it."
MRS. DRUMMOND'S COMMENT.
A few days after I got back to H -
[Mrs. Drummond's
home] I quite unexpectedly came upon a halfpenny in a drawer.
It was at the very back of the drawer, covered with veils and
gloves', and on it was the date 1902, the date my son went first
to a preparatory school. I don't keep loose coins in any drawer.
There was no other coin there, nor in any of the other drawers.
DEC., 1922. Cases.
The above statement is corroborated by Mrs. Drummond's
daughter, thus :
I certify this to be correct. M - L .
In a letter to Mrs. Salter Mrs. Drummond comments furthrr
upon the incident, thus :
July 26, 1921.
. . . What makes it [the above incident] very good in my
opinion is that my son's preparatory school is often in my mind,
because there is one near here and the boys go to the same
church that I do, and whenever they pass my seat, I think of
him and his first term at C , Sept. 1902. When I got down
here after the sitting I saw in a small silver tray on a chest of
drawers 2 farthings. One had a date that I thought was 1902.
It was rather indistinct and I wasn't sure, so I asked my daughter
who said it was 1909. I thought the test was a failure, as
1909 conveyed nothing to me. So sure was I that no coins
were in a drawer that I never even looked. About two days
later I was looking in a drawer for a veil and right at the
back, completely covered by veils and gloves, I came upon a
halfpenny with the date 1902 on it. I at once went for my
daughter who came and saw it and saw there were no other
coins in the drawer. . . .
I have just examined all the coins in my purse and out of
eleven coins with legible dates there are none with 1902.

We print below a further incident which occurred at the
sittings with the ouija board held by Mr. and Mrs. J. F. C.
Kimber and their friends ;
some earlier incidents were printed
in the Journal for January of this year (Vol. XX., p. 191).
The names and addresses of all the persons concerned are
known to the Society, but by request we use pseudonyms
or initials here except in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Kimber.
The sitters on this occasion were Mr. and Mrs. Kimber's
two friends, Mrs. Ellis and her sister, Mrs. Dixon, who also
took part in the earlier experiments. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.
Kimber were present during the sitting but, as stated below,
400 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922-
Mr. Kimber saw the record two days later before the verifica-
tion was obtained.
Mr. Kimber's account of the incident was contained in a
letter to Mrs. Sidgwick, thus :
Christmas, 1921.
I think you will be interested in the extract below which came
through at a sitting at Mrs. [Ellis's] house the other day . . .

K. BAKE TEST CAKE BURN.
K. W. lives and was at the time of the sitting at Tenby
S. Wales. And in answer to enquiries writes :
Dec. 7, 1921.
On Sunday, Dec. 4, I was baking cakes and was feeling
very fussed over one that was in the oven, and I felt it was
going to burn. I told the maid to take it out of the oven
and she forgot, and it did burn.
The above sitting took place in the evening of the day on
which the cake was burnt, 200 miles away. . . .
J. F. C. KIMBER.
In a letter to Mrs. Sidgwick, dated December 30, 1921, Mr.
Kimber gives K. W.'s name and states that she was privately
engaged to 0. S., the supposed communicator at the sitting.
In a further letter Mr. Kimber writes :
Jan. 4, 1922.
... As regard the

test, the sitting was on
Dec. 4th, and I saw the notes on the 6th ;

NOTES ON PERIODICALS.
The Psychological Bulletin for January, 1922, is
mainly taken up
with its abstracts of periodical literature and book reviews. Tin-
Revue Philosophique for May and June contains an article by
J. Wahl on William James, as seen in the pages of his corre-
spondence, a paper which is to be continued in the following
number.
Psychische Studien for May has an appreciation of Baron von
Schrenck-Notzing on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday by
General Peter ;
an account by Herr Grunewald of his experi-
ments with Nielsen in Copenhagen, and the first of two articles
by Count von Klinckowstroem on Indian tricks. He begins by
briefly reviewing some of the literature dealing with the tricks of
the East, including the Mango Tree Trick and the Basket Trick.
In the second part, which appeared in Psychische Studien for
June, he prints an account of the Rope Trick from the record of
Dr. Schonbrunn, a Viennese lawyer, who wrote to him on July
16, 1921. The latter says that on a certain occasion in December,
1904, he found himself in the native town of Ahmedabad and met
there a great crowd of people together with a fakir. The fakir
had a long beard, his head was shaved and he was splashed with
cow dung. Hoping to see the rope trick, Dr. Schonbrunn en-
couraged the fakir, who, grinning and beckoning to him, slowly
led him to a kind of rude platform. Still laughing the fakir
suddenly made a quick movement and to his surprise the lawyer
saw that the fakir had a rather thick handful of rope. Then
turning to the crowd a small naked boy came running up, and
the fakir turning his grinning face once more, showed the rope
and then threw it suddenly into the air. To his astonishment
Dr. Schonbrunn did not see the rope fall down but saw that it
was apparently suspended in space hanging down to within about
a foot from the ground. Thinking he was being hypnotized, he
dug the nail of the middle finger of his right hand into the palm
of his left and felt the pain and saw the characteristic half-moon
impression.
The fakir then made a sign to the child, who climbed up the
rope at great speed. Thinking that he alone was being influenced
the lawyer glanced at the crowd below and noticed that they
were all
gazing up to the end of the rope as he had done himself.
402 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1922.
After a few seconds the fakir made further signs and the child
again reappeared as if
springing from the rope to the ground,
finally disappearing into the crowd.
Pointing out that photography alone would solve the question
of hallucination in these Indian tricks, the article continues with
an account of some hypnotic experiments conducted by Fritz
Paulsen in Vienna some two years ago. In these experiments
the rope trick was said to be duplicated by the hypnotist, who
caused more than one person to see the phenomenon as it is
described in India.
In the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research
for June is published the continuation of the case of Mrs. West,
with an account of some more of her remarkable and puzzling
visions. Mr. Hayward contributes a few notes on methods of
faking spirit photographs, whilst Dr. Prince has a wise note on
the evidence for the supernormal as illustrated by the Cushman
spirit photograph taken by the English medium, Mrs. Deane.
The Occult Review for July has a brief account of the artist
and astrologer John Varley, an article on the mysticism of Shelley,
and some notes on exorcism as applied to haunted houses.
The Revue Metapsychique for May and June contains the reply
by Professor Richet to Sir Oliver Lodge on the spirit hypothesis,
an article on light as seen in living animals and plants and several
translations from papers appearing in Light and elsewhere.
In the French journal UOpinion for July 8, 1922, appears
the report of the Sorbonne Committee on the phenomena of
Eva C. The idea of the sittings appears to have originated with
one Heuze, a French journalist, who persuaded Madame Bisson
to allow the medium Eva to be investigated by a Committee from
the Sorbonne comprising Drs. Lapicque, Dumas, Pieron, and
Laugier. Fifteen sittings had been arranged, of which two had
to be abandoned owing to the indisposition of the medium. The
results were almost negative, only a small quantity of saliva being
observed and a portion of whitish substance which she appeared
to swallow almost immediately. In their conclusions the Com-
mittee pay respect to the good faith and enthusiasm for scientific
investigation displayed by Madame Bisson, but regret that their
results must be considered as entirely negative. The conclusion
is fully justified by the facts. The press, however, took the
results as an exposure of the medium and published a garbled
DEC., 1922. Notes on Period i< 4<>3
account of the Committee's findings. In subsequent issues of
L'Opinion Paul Heuze continues to discuss modem psychical
research in a manner which would lead one to suppose his desire
was to cast ridicule upon the whole subject. The articles
translated into English and appeared in the Daily Tel&jnijti-
July 15, 22, 29 ; August 5, 14, 19, 28 and September 4 and 12.
The American Society's Journal for July contains the con-
tinuation of Dr. Walter Prince's survey of the case of Mrs. West,
in which a sitting for raps is described, which Dr. Prince believes
to have been very striking. In the August issue appears Dr. Prince's
report on the poltergeist case near Antigonish in Nova Scotia. He
found evidence of probable dissociation in the girl, but apparently
concludes that certain sounds and tactual sensations experienced by
two visitors to the house were supernormal. In the same number
is a brief review of the experiment recently conducted with the
Crewe Circle, and an account of certain coincidental and other
experiences recorded by Helen J. Clarke. The September issue
contains an article by Mr. Blewett Lee on Mediumship and the
Criminal Law, and also an amusing example selected by the
Editor as an illustration of the differences between Spiritualists
and Psychical Researchers.
In Psychische Studien for September Hofmann discusses Darget's
experiments on the V Rays, whilst in the October number A. \Y.
Sellin notices instances of what he describes as
"
ferromagnetic
"
influences on watches. Schwab has also an article on the sympa-
thetic nervous system ;. whilst Dr. Lebrecht translates Dr. Geley's
account of his experiences with the clairvoyant, Stephan Ossowiecki.
The October number of Psychic Science has an article by Sir
Conan Doyle on the Fox Sisters, in which he compares their
mediumship with more modern mediums ;
an article by the
Principal of the British College of Psychic Science upon recent
charges against spirit photographers, in which he publishes a
portion of the correspondence relating to Mrs. Deane's refusal to
use the marked plates issued by the College ;
an interesting
account of the mediumship of Frau Maria Silbert, the Austrian
physical medium, and a note on the Carinthian poltergeist girl,
Hannie, by Commander Kogelnik of Braunau, Austria.
The Revue Metapsychique for July-August has a note on the
Sorbonne experiments with Eva C., and a friendly reply by Sir
Oliver Lodge to Prof. Richet on the hypothesis of survival. An
404 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. DEC., 1022.
account is also published by Dr. Geley of his experiments with
the sealed letter reader Ossowiecki, in Warsaw, The article is
really a short summary of the experiments and results, and any
criticism is impossible without knowing the full facts. As with
Eva C. and Franek Kluski, Dr. Geley has not published his
conditions, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow the
experiments intelligently. From what is said, however, it appears
that Ossowiecki succeeded in gaining information concerning the
contents of sealed letters in a manner which the investigators
believe to be supernormal. To take one experiment as an illustra-
tion, it appears that Prof. Richet before leaving Warsaw in April,
gave Dr. Geley a sealed letter given to him by Mme. de Noailles.
On taking it from his pocket the outer envelope was torn, and
so another was substituted for it. The date of giving it to Dr.
Geley is not given, nor is the history of the letter previous to
giving it to Dr. Geley. We are not told the size of the envelope,
neither the colour, nor thickness. We do not even know whether
the piece of paper within was folded once or twice or folded at
all. All we are told is that the envelope was in the inner
pocket of Dr. Geley's greatcoat, remaining there until given to the
medium. However M. Ossowiecki succeeded in obtaining the full
sense of the passage which had been written by Mme. de Noailles
on the paper within the sealed packet. There are several
examples of similar experiments with other investigators reported
in the same manner, and the article closes with a highly interest-
ing account of his sensations by Ossowiecki himself.

CORRESPONDENCE.
CONCERNING " AN ADVENTURE."
To the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE S.P.R.
MADAM,
Will you allow me space to say that the two ladies who wrote
a book called An Adventure, relating an experience of theirs at
Versailles in connexion with the Trianon and Marie Antoinette,
have allowed me to see the original documents and correspondence
connected with the case ;
which they have filed in systematic and
orderly form, and propose to deposit in the archives of St. Hugh's
College, Oxford, so that they may be available for future students
who may wish to examine the credentials and verify details of
this experience, as part of a study of similar historical visions,
should they occur.
I record the fact of their location in the Journal because it is
a publication which students, even in the distant future, are
bound to be aware of.
