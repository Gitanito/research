When I separated from my body, I had a feeling of floating.  I had a feeling of total blessedness, a very intense wellbeing. I was floating in surroundings, which were very luminous and soft, rising up towards a more intense luminosity. Then nothing more, I came round much later in the intensive care unit. The doctors brought me back after defibrillation and the transfusion of several units of blood.
