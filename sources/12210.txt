  		              		Experience Description   

    I was given a drug that was laced with fentanyl.  I knew immediately afterwards that I was going to die.  

  I fell backwards and continued falling for what seemed like forever.  I saw glimpses of my life from the very beginning and only visions of everything I had ever done wrong. I kept falling until I found myself in the middle of the city where I was born.  It looked like the city had been hit by a bomb and I was the only person there.  I had an overwhelming feeling that I was in Hell.  I had been shown the reasons why God sent me to Hell while I was falling. I knew that I had caused myself this outcome and I knew it was too late to change. 

  Then suddenly I was back in my body and I was alive! I was so excited and grateful for God blessing me with this wake up call.  I have gone from questioning if God existed; to sharing this story with others in hope of it changing other people's lives. I was shown that if I didn't get my life together now, I would spend eternity suffering in Hell. Heaven has to exist because I know for sure that I've been to hell. I know I never want to spend eternity living alone with nothing but my mistakes and guilt holding me down.
