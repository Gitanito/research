That day I was going to get a penicillin shot in my Grandma’s house, but out the blue the car on ignition locked, so I had to call a locksmith and pay him the only 200 pesos I had which my Grandma had given me to buy cotton balls and alcohol.  I decided to get the shot later after getting off work. When I arrived at the hospital, they injected me with 800 units of penicillin, which provoked the shutdown of my hearing and throat. 

Sometime later, they laid me on a stretcher where I saw a cousin of mine who I told to call all my friends to say goodbye to them.  Instantly I lost my sight and was deaf. I began to listen to the Act of Contrition, which I hadn’t learned when I was in my catechism lessons, but at that moment, I knew it all.  At the same time, I began to feel such a peaceful feeling that I had never felt before. I saw a child taking me by his hand to a place where a lot of people were welcoming me, a very nice place. I did not want to come back, because I was so happy, but something pulled me back and I awoke. 

It was a short period of time, but my heart had stopped: that is what the doctor told me.  I was in psychological therapy for 6 months after that incident.  I always thought it was going to happen again. To this day, I am a happy person and understand life through a lot of tranquility.  I know now life can end in one minute and the only thing that will happen is that you won’t be back.  The peacefulness I felt does not compare to anything else, not even nature or the nicest or most silent place on earth.

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     To believe that God saves us is good, but I discovered that if you believe and are good, this will reflect in your life and eventually in your death. On the other hand, if you are bad, you will be bad after death, if you are good expect good things.

I also know that the life that follows is for everyone, from the richest more humble man, to the homeless most humble man, and that we are all equal.  Some people may say that we all know this, but the difference lies in that people think about it. But myself: I lived through it and I believe it with proof.  Now my life includes proving elements to say why we have to view us as all equal beings.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?     No   No   

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   …of course, before this incident I was a bad person due to all the bad things that had happened to me.  I could not find peace or see what I have seen now.  I could not even imagine at that time the great peace and everything I saw, I have never given any testimony to anyone as to what happened. It is very hard to explain, but now I know that in the future when I die, it will feel good.

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience   los otros eventos terrenales, puede haber una fiesta y sabes que l amejor fiesta te da alegria,puedes graduarte de la universidad y es otra sensacion,puedes sacarte la loteria y es otra sensacion,lo que se que la paz y alegria que tenia era mejor que la misma loteria..no se lo que es ganarse la loteria pero si se que no hay comparacion con nada

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     Sometimes I feel someone is going to die or that some people may be linked to my life. Sometimes people come to me and talk to me and I cause them to change their feelings and change internally.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Everything is meaningful about it.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I talked to a priest, but he told me that I should give testimony, but I cannot give testimony just to the Catholic Church, I have to speak to everyone.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I define my experience from it as the people gathered to greet me, just as an important person is expected to arrive. There were no security policemen. There is a life after death; I felt it and I saw it.  In reference to a mystical universal connection, yes, because of the unified group of people, all of them were smiling and seem to be waiting. At that time, I was someone who did a lot damage to other people due to my upbringing. The fact of saying ‘I’m sorry’ or pray the Act of Contrition, I know it is necessary. We have to live in peace to get to that place, I recommend it.  Maybe you do not believe in God or Buddha or any other, but the fact of always doing what is good is the best for all of us. It is something very beautiful, indescribable, something like when you know how death is; you know how to live and what to do to be well. Take everything in stride to be happy and know how to be grateful for every breath we take. I am happy but with happiness along with consciousness because I know someday soon I’ll have to leave, I saw that: but I am okay, it is an honor to live.   Other earthly events, such as parties, you know they will make you happy, you can graduate from college and that will make you happy and it is another sensation, you can win the lotto and it gives you yet another sensation, but one thing I know: the peace and happiness I was feeling were even greater than winning the lotto. I don’t personally know how it is to win the lotto, but there is no comparison with anything else.    

  				                  Experience Description 7024  					</p>  					I was working in the street, but I was feeling very bad because of the flu, then it occurred to me to call my grandmother, who gave shots. She told me she could give me a shot of penicillin.  She told me she did not have cotton balls nor alcohol, I should go and buy some at the pharmacy when I got off work.  At that time, new cars had entered and I was working on one when suddenly it locked me out while it was on.  The strange thing is that these new cars won’t lock unless they are shut down or are activated automatically at a certain speed; then, with the car closed shut and I decided to call the locksmith and pay him the only 200 pesos I had with me.

At that time, I had just gone through a separation and was very sad. I took it easy and thought it will be better to go the hospital to get the shot after work.  I needed this shot because I had been bitten by a dog a few days earlier while working.  I got home, changed, and told my cousin to come with me.  At the hospital, they gave me the shot and my sight and hearing suddenly shut down; my head was spinning and I could not stand on my own.  I felt a very awful angst and asked the doctors to help me. 

I started to feel an immense peace, my throat shut down and I stopped breathing. Later, I turned to my cousin and told her, ‘Cousin, go get all my friends and my mother, I want to say goodbye to them’. The peace I felt was beautiful and indescribable, I was blind and deaf, and started to listen to the act of Contrition in my head, which I had not known in my entire life.  During catechism lessons I listened to it, thought it was nice, but could never learn it.  I could only see a boy taking me by his hand to a white entrance, very beautiful and getting brighter and brighter all time.  I saw beings clapping at me for having arrived and suddenly someone told me, ‘No’. 

Something pulled me back and I woke up in the hospital. The doctor said my heart had stopped and I came back.  You were almost gone forever, he told me.   After that my senses were weird, my eyes saw things further away and closer and I was afraid it would happen again.   I spent many years trying to understand what had happened to me, I have researched and know now there are many people like me.  God bless them all.
