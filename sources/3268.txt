The Nature of CoMETS .
14
15
15 In refpeet to the nature of Comets, Sir
16 Ifaac Ne::wtan obferves (as well as others
16 fince, that they muft be folid home'S, like
16 the planets; for, if they were nothing but
J 6 vapours; they muft be diffipated when the~
17 come near the Sun ; for the Comet in
I 7 I68o, when it was in its perihelion, was
J 7 1efs difrant from the Sun than one-fixth of
17 the Sun's diameter; confeguently the heat
I 7 of the Comet at that time was o-the heat
17 of the fummer Sun as 28ooo to 1. But
17 the heat of boiling water is about three
17 times greater than the heat which dry
I7 earth acquires from the fummer Sun; and
16 the heat of red hot iron about three or fgur
16 times greater than the heat of boiling
I6 water. Therefore the heat 0f dry e·o\rth at
16 the Comet, when in its periltelion, was

45 8 1
5 about 2000 times greater than red-hot
1~ ~ 1
4 iron. By fuch heat, all vapours would be
T l4 immediately diffipated. This neat vf the
47 8 1
3 Comet mt!ft be retained a very long time;
4
8 8 12
for a red-hot ~lobe of iron; of -an inch
+8 8 12
diameter, expofed to tke open air, fcarce
49 8 11
lofes all its heat in an hour; bnt a greater
5° 8 10
globe would retain its heat longer, in pro-
51 8 9 portion to its diameter, becaufe the fur-
SI
8 ~ face, at which it grows cold, varies in that
52 8 proportion lefs than the quantity of hot
53 8 ~ matter. Therefore a globe of red-hot iron.
54 8 as big as our earth, would fcarcely cool in
55 8 5 socoo years. The Comet in 168o cQming
56 8 4 fo near to the Sun, muft ha e been con
58 8 2
fiderably retarded by the Sun's a o-
59 8 1
fphere; a·nd therefore, being attra ed
0 8 0
nearer at every revolution, it ""ill at liilt

THE SECOND PART.
Containing variety of matter in profe and verfe, part neceifary
to compiete a performance of this kind, part colle·~ed or com-
pofed by the author, for the inHruc1ion and impiOvement of
Britifh youth, or of thofe who, in the humble vale of !if~
h&ve fouls fuperior to the opportunities given them, to improve
in the various branches of fcience; and concluding with the
kind contributions of his learned and ingenious correfpon-
dents, to whom he once more returns his fincere thank for
their favours and generous affiibnce in a work defigned at
leaft ,
" To raife the foul by tenJer fl:rokes of art,
" To wake the genius, and to mend the heart;
'' To make mankind in Nature's.Il:udy bold;-
" Look o'er each fcene, ~nd m&d"k what they behold."
Of the ECLIPSES of the SUN and MOON that
will happen in this Year, 1799•
IN this year, there will happen only two Eclipfes, and
they both of the SuN ; therefore no Eclipfes of the MooN
will happen this year. ,
The firft of thefe Solar Eclipfes will happen on Suttday, the
5th day of May, at a quarter before our one o'clock in the
morning ; therefore, of <;ourfe, it muft be im·ifible to us. Thii
Eclipfe
I 799· 011 the EcLiPsEs.· 33
Edipfe will he both central and annular in the great Soutl1
Sea, and p:1rticularly under 8 degrees of North Latitude, and
178 degrees of-Eaft Longitude from London, where this beauti-
ful central appearance will fall upon them precifely at 1 z
o'clock at noon.-This Eclipfe, more or lefs partiaiJy
edipfed, will be vifible at the Sandwich Iflands, at the
Society and Friendly Illands, the New Hebrides, New Cale-
donia, and as far·as New Zealand, towards the South Pole,-
lt will be feen in New Holland, New Guinea, the Ladrone
Hlands, and as far North from thence as the Hland of
Japan,
The other Solar Eclipfe happens on Moltda)', the 28th day
cf OC!oher, at half an hour paft our 5 o'clock in the evening
1nvifible to us; for the Sp.n fcts that day, at L?11don, at 54
minutes paft 4 o'clock. ThiS is <~lfo a very great Eclipfe, and
will be both central and total at nocn-day, in 5 degrees ..1 s
min. South Latitude, and near 83 degrees of Longitude 'V'eft
from Lo11don; which is in the gr\!at Pacific O:ean, or great
South Sc;1, near the weil:ern co:dl: of Peru in South America.
T is Eclipfe will be vif1ble, more or lefs in quantity, to the
whole continent of South America ; it will be fecn at the
iOand of Jamaica, .at the ifland of CuLa, and all the reft of
the \Veil: L dia iflands ; it will otlfo be feen in Florida~
Georgia, and Carolina, in t_
he fout;hern parts of North ,
America. I expeCt it will be fcen to the 'vVeftward, as far
as Otahcite, one of tt1e Society Iflands, and as far Eaftward as
the Cape Vcrd iOands, on the coaft of Africa.
Upon CJuifday, the ;th day of 1liay, there happens a notable
Tranfit of the planet ll1~:rcury, over the Sun, and vifible from
the beginning to the end, to us, and all Europe: afld that
for the fpace of near feven lionts and a half. The planet
Mercury, divefted intirely of its radiancy, will be feen on the
Sun, in form of a round black fpot, and vifible, if the fky be
clear at the time, to all places of the Earth where the Sun is
up. MercuYJ will be feen by iliarp eyes, only defunded by
the interpof1tion of a dark gJafs, or a piece of clear window-

Tbc following is an Account of Two Occultations of tbe
PLANETS by the MooN.
On rP"ednejday, the 16th of Janumy, there happens an
Occultation of the Planet JuPITER by the lvloon, and vifible
in thefe Part , if the air prove favourable. Jupiter will be
feen to immerge behind the dark part of the J.lioon, at 49
minutes paft 1 o'clock in the morning; and will again
be feen to emerge from the bright part of the !11ocn, at
40 minutes p~fi: 2, apparent time, at Lcndou, after being
hid 51 minutes. This Occultation will appear very beautiful
through a telefcope, fhould it prove a clear moining.
On Saturday, the 24th of November, foon after the Moo"'
rifes in the morning, fhe will eclipfe that bright refulgent
planet Venus, then the Morning Star. J7e;zus will immerge
behind the bright part of the Moon, at 5 min. paft 4 o'clock ;
and l'enus will again be fcen to emerge from behin,d the dark
part of the JJ1oon, at 4 minutes pail 5, apparent time, after
being hid 59 minutes. This Occultation wi11 make a pretty
appearance through a tdefcope. Thefe two Occultations (if
clouds interpofe not) may be feen with the naked eye.

for peace, whilfr others imply war and bloodfued; nnd af er
this manner we ihall find the nations of the earth difpofed.-
The two grand fuperiors, Saturn and Jupiter; are no~ circum.

lately be'en in a Sextile afpeB: to each othc:r: thefe planets, in
their paiTage through the Zodiac, have fome efieB: over the
ruling pafi:ons of mankind; for, by their Trine and Sextile
z.fp~.Bs, • firfr one and then another have withdrawn themfclves
from the f, ene of blood and !laughter, and have made peace
with J-ra,he; yet the other configur;uions (as fecond caufcs under

Afct:ndants, different effects on others, fo that war,cruefwar,even
to the time of my writing, has been nece!fclrily profccuted on

an attempt to negociate a peace with France, to no effect. In.
taking a proper view of this Ingrefs, I fi_p.d there is fome
appearance now oftreaties offered; and ambalfadors employed ;
yet I doubt it will come to nothing ; for here is a Conjunction
of Jupiter and Mars in the M. C. in the Afcendant of lrelaml,
which is a fanguine and very malignant Afpect, denoting
great calamities to mankind, as commotions, wars, fub\•erfion
of kingdoms and ftates ; alterations of laws, cuftoms and

the AUTUMNAL Q!JARTER.

The Winter C22arter commences on the 21ft of Decemher,

doubtlefs there will be enough of that, in regard there are fo

~arter is naturally cold and moift; young and choleric
people are now beft in health, but a$ed and phlegmatic people
t:1e contrary. In thefe months, melancholy and phlegm do
nmch increafe. It is now good to keep warm, and to eat
fuch me:l ts as are of an hot quality. It is now not g od to
bleed and purge, unle(s there be great occafion. To drink
wine fomctimes, and t•) u[e fpices in your diet, is very good.-
The fame oKerve in 'January; but in February, you may take

occafion.-I now end, praying GoD to defend our Sovereign
Lord King GEORGE, and all his ofEpring, and to endue him,

Some readers will deride what's here recited,
As heretofore they other truths have flighted i
Yet fome of my prefiges, yon'vc beheld,
