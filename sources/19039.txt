yes hello I&#39;m dr. Steven Greer and
founder of the disclosure project and
this is a special announcement about a
new campaign we were launching this week
and that is to end permanently the
secrecy around UFOs and free energy
devices all of you are familiar with the
work we did with Sirius which became the
top pick on Netflix in the past year and
I&#39;d like to thank all of you for
supporting that project of this project
and the disclosure project launched in
2001 at the National Press Club are
really focusing purely on top secret
unacknowledged special access projects
that deal with the UFO extraterrestrial
and free energy or zero-point energy
fields and what we&#39;re doing with this
campaign is not just advocating for the
government to do something this is the
campaign that will actually end the
illegal secrecy and what&#39;s key about the
words here is that we are doing this not
the government and I think you have to
understand that the people are the
government in a democracy and our
government is completely failed us on
this and many other issues and is
dysfunctional and corrupt therefore it&#39;s
incumbent on us the people of the world
not just the United States to come
together to support this endeavor we are
now working with people from all over
the world who have access to archives
dealing with the UFO subject government
top secret witnesses videos photographs
and other material and we are asking you
the public to support this campaign and
you can go to our website serious
disclosure calm or to the other links
you will see in this film to support it
in a number of ways but one of the chief
distinctions I want to make between this
and other disclosure efforts that are
going on is that this is not an effort
to ask anyone else to do it this is a
campaign where we the people actually do
it and we were therefore calling this
the
pain that actually ends the illegal
secrecy illegal is a key word here and I
want all the military corporate
intelligence officials government
officials who know about the operations
that deal with UFOs advanced
technologies such as zero-point
antigravity gravity control and related
subjects that those projects even though
you know may not be aware of it because
you are in a compartment away from most
of the other leadership of the
organizations that manage them are being
run illegally I will get more into this
in a moment what the public needs to
understand is that the future of our
civilization not only in how we live on
this planet and whether we have a
environment and an eco biosphere an
ecosystem will live in will be here but
also how we&#39;re going to live into the
future and what our relationship will be
with these interstellar civilizations is
hanging in the balance
and so this isn&#39;t something that we can
expect the next president or the next
Congress or the next Parliament in
England or whoever to deal with
personally I have been involved at that
level since 1992
whether it be top generals at the
Pentagon the Clinton administration the
CIA director for President Clinton etc
and what I have seen is that there is
enormous interest in those corridors but
for the most part they don&#39;t have access
to these unacknowledged special access
projects keyword use app and since they
don&#39;t there&#39;s only so much they can do
and so what we are doing is what perhaps
they are either afraid to do don&#39;t have
the courage to do perhaps get threatened
when they try or simply feel that it&#39;s
too big for them to take on one senator
said to us what you&#39;re asking me to do
is to reel in a 2,000 pound whale and I
have a five pound line I can&#39;t do it so
ultimately what I think we have to
realize is that
this is the exactly the situation at
Thomas Jefferson and others spoke of
that periodically the people have to
come together and make these changes
ourselves and not be passive and sheep
like waiting for the government to do it
and it&#39;s for this reason that over the
26 years I&#39;ve been involved with this
this is by far the largest campaign I&#39;ve
been involved with and we&#39;re going to
need your help every one of you whether
you can contribute a dollar or a hundred
thousand dollars whether you can help
network this to people on your Facebook
page on your social media Twitter
whether you can help be a scout for us
to find new top secret whistleblowers
who are in these programs and who don&#39;t
know that they&#39;re being managed
illegally it may be a father it may be a
huncle it may be a husband or wife or a
friend or a neighbor they are out there
and what we are calling for is for
everyone to come together and support
this campaign this campaign initially
over the next six to eight months has
three components a full-length feature
documentary film so serious sort of
introduced the scope of our work to the
public this is going to drill down in a
granular way on these top-secret illegal
projects the technologies that they are
hiding where they are who&#39;s doing it and
how they&#39;re managed and we will prove in
this film but they are being managed
illegally
what the purpose of that is is that this
film needs to be seen by hundreds of
millions if not a billion or two people
around the world and so we have put
together a team commensurate with that
task but to fund this right now we have
no funding to fund this we&#39;re going to
need the people to support it and you
can go to our crowdfunding page and see
what our budget is and also see that
that is sort of the minimal budget in
addition to this full-length feature
film we&#39;re going to have a
that is a compendium to the film that
will course be able to have even more
detailed information in it
world-renowned author Steve Alton who&#39;s
a New York Times bestselling author and
also has a publishing company and his
publishing company and I have joined to
put out this book that will be the
definitive collection of evidence and
information that anyone wanting the
proof on the subject would be able to
pick up and read and it will be
distributed in the mainstream
distribution system for books so that is
also part of the crowdfunding campaign
is a production for that new book and
then the third component which is being
studied I can&#39;t say that we have all the
elements in place but we have many of
the elements in place is a global
concert and announcement event for the
film the book and most importantly for
these new energy technologies now here I
want to make a comment and this is
something incredibly important over the
last month I have met a number of people
who have committed to not only putting
on this concert event but who also have
access to some of the most renowned
musicians celebrities in the world we
hope we can organize this in the next
few months with both the film and the
book but also a featured technology will
be on the stage now this is something we
are still running to ground I would do
not want people to think we have a
secure jet but we&#39;re on very close to
the acquisition of one or more of these
systems even if they are prototypes and
when I refer to these devices and
technologies I&#39;m talking about a closed
loop free energy device something that
runs itself the input is charged from
the output and it is running and
powering things putting out useable
kilowatt egde of power or wattage we
know these have existed for over a
hundred years since the time of Tesla
and before and they have always been
suppressed
we now know that there is a support team
behind us who have the financial ability
to make any reasonable offer to anyone
in the world with such a device so that
their needs can be taken care of
financially and we can open-source this
to the world let me be very clear on
what I&#39;m saying we have the team in
place to provide any means of support
that is reasonable to any inventor or
technology holder with such a zero point
or free energy device even something
like LAN are the low energy nuclear
reaction cold fusion systems zero-point
quantum vacuum we have these folks on
board this project at this time and they
are committed fully to open sourcing
this our agreement is explicit that the
people who will work with us on this and
are working with us have agreed to
support the scientists the inventors and
the technology holders in any way they
need to financially and strategically my
team will launch this technology and put
it out to the public free of cost
the plans all the intellectual property
will be open source
no patenting and no secrets so that the
world can quickly adopt the technology
and pull us out of the precipice away
from the precipice that we are plunging
down and that is a biosphere collapse
due to our use of fossil fuels and
nuclear power and the increasing haves
and have-nots impoverishment of the
world
Deut that is necessary unfortunately
when you&#39;re using fossil fuel systems
and central utilities half the world&#39;s
population is in enormous poverty and
this is an artificial result of the
energy system and the basic
infrastructure our civilization is using
so as an act of compassion to our fellow
humans we know that this needs to be
moved in a way that doesn&#39;t fall into
all the pre-existing traps
dealing with technology seizures
national security orders patent seizures
corporate buyouts of technologies that
then put them on a black shelf all of
that has to be overcome and the only way
to do it is to get these technologies
have them independently reproduced and
proven and then massively and I mean
massively disclosed so our goal is at
this concert and Technology announcement
event would be a global celebration of
us starting a new chapter in human
civilization on earth a civilization
that can endure for hundreds of
thousands of years without destroying
the biosphere and is worthy of going
into space peacefully and is capable
then of having a just society so we find
a way to make peace on this planet this
is really the scope of the project and
over I would say the 26 years that I&#39;ve
been involved with this I have never
seen the sort of support and significant
people who now get it I think this has
reached a critical mass of consciousness
where the people who understand the
problems that we&#39;re in in this planet
now are really onboard and these are
really substantial groups of folks not
just in the United States but in the
Middle East Europe Asia India throughout
the world
I&#39;ve been carefully building this
network for 25 years and is my hope that
this is now going to be the fruition of
those endeavors but we really can&#39;t do
it alone
we not only need your financial support
for this campaign that ends illegal
secrecy we need your networking support
because the reason we survived the
launch of the disclosure project is that
there were millions of people watching
or anyone who tries to do something like
this in obscurity I was told in 1991 by
a national security attorney they are
all dead men walking however if we come
together in unity
to crew to do this together and bring
millions of people billions if we can
onto the platform we can launch this
technology and launch this information
in a way
this simply cannot be stopped I was just
looking through this which is the
briefing packet that was done put
together for a President Obama that was
provided to John Podesta who is probably
talked so much about how he regrets as
in his long years in government not
being able to affect UFO disclosure and
as you know Hillary Clinton and others
have been talking about this on Jimmy
Kimmel and others what I&#39;m quite sure of
is that their inability to do anything
about it is because of this nature and
the structure of illegal secrecy so
that&#39;s what we have to do we have to do
this because the system here in
Washington and by the way I&#39;m speaking
to you from Washington DC and looking
right now at the Washington Monument and
the White House this is something for us
we the people to do and I think that if
we wait for the government to do it
we&#39;ll all be dead I&#39;ll be a hundred
years old before it will happen
and I think if the people lead however
the leaders will then follow so we have
to be the leadership effort and that&#39;s
what every person listening that this
has to understand I want to empower each
of you to view yourselves as citizens of
the earth but also citizens of the
cosmos
and that it is our charge it is our
challenge it&#39;s our task to begin a new
civilization on this planet that can go
forward into space and peace and using
free energy and have a just civilization
on earth where we eliminate once and for
all environmental destruction and
punishing poverty which which is now so
prevalent around the world only then are
we worthy to be welcomed into the
neighborhood of interplanetary and
interstellar civilizations so this is
the great challenge of our time and you
cannot have peace
this world when you&#39;re living in a
system that is so unjust that it
guarantees half the world is in horrible
poverty and for those of us who aren&#39;t
in horrible poverty our very existence
is cannibalizing Mother Earth and
destroying her this is no way for people
to live so it&#39;s our time to do the right
thing this is the time
there&#39;s no generation to pass this on to
a hundred years ago there were cans
kicked down the road fifty years ago on
the UFO etsu cans were kicked down the
road this is 2016 we don&#39;t have another
hundred years
neither the geopolitical situation nor
the environmental situation can we stand
another hundred years of inaction
passivity and cowardice so we have to
find the courage to do this somehow and
I think if we all work together we can
do it it&#39;s nothing I can do by myself
there&#39;s nothing any one person can do
but if we all come together and do it it
absolutely can be done it can be done
very quickly and what I&#39;ve been feeling
what I&#39;ve been sensing the elements are
all coming together very quickly there
has been a building like this and now
it&#39;s gone straight up in terms of the
people institutions what have you that
are involved in the project we&#39;ve been
working on for 25 years and I&#39;m hopeful
incredibly hopeful that this can be done
over the next coming months and couple
of years so we&#39;re not talking about an
event you know twenty years down the
road we&#39;re talking about an event in the
coming months and year or two and I hope
that all of you will join us you&#39;ll help
us with the crowdfunding at the site
that&#39;s on the screen I hope you can help
us with finding these the evidence and
witnesses and that you know you&#39;ll keep
what we&#39;re doing in your thoughts and
prayers as we start on this enormous
undertaking and do doing this as we
think about our children and our
grandchildren and those who come to this
planet after as I always say that we&#39;re
really how starting a civilizational
change that&#39;s a once in every few
thousand years
and that there are thousands of
generations in that great waiting room
in the cosmic sky waiting to come to
earth and waiting for us to get it right
thank you
