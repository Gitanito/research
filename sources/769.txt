 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Journal and Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research      

      Summary:  The Proceedings were the public output, and the Journal the members-and-associates-only output, of the UK-based Society for Psychical Research, perhaps the most famous psychic investigations group of the modern era. Ample discussion of the SPR's history, members and accomplishments can be found on the SPR's own website, and on Wikipedia. For the publications of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR), consult the IAPSOP periodical index.

 	A combined index through 1904 is also available.
