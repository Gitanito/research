the other thing I want to share in this
sort of introductory you know these
first couple hours is the understanding
of the mind and all the different ways
that our experience can relate to ET
manifestations now there&#39;s something
called in the Vedic tradition the cities
sidd h is these are different abilities
and powers that people can develop as
they develop higher consciousness
now these run the gamut over almost
everything you&#39;ve heard about some of
which has been relegated to mythology
but it&#39;s actually very real such as
levitation dematerialization
materialization changes in your body
density to move through solid objects
precognition we&#39;ve talked about
teleportation telepathy materialization
of objects etc and so on and so forth
now those are all things that actually
humans can do those are advanced
applications of higher states of
consciousness but understand that
there&#39;s a scientific correlation to
every conscious City so whatever that
you can imagine that any enlightened
master has done can be routinized or
made routine through a scientific method
even when it up to and including levels
of the astral you might call celestial
conscious cause cosmos and do it
scientifically I always tell people that
the a really hilarious story of this
captain of a Navy contract vessel that
was in the South Pacific in 63 Jacques
Vallee had the story but he didn&#39;t have
the source it was a third hand story for
him where we had we&#39;re testing the I
think they were that the Atlas
intercontinental ballistic missiles we
were firing them down stream in the
South Atlantic and this captain who
contacted me
on a ship that was retrieving them after
a test fire now these were not hot they
didn&#39;t have nuclear weapons on them they
were trying to get the missile to be
accurate but the missiles kept missing
their mark and they knew there was some
kind of a subtle electromagnetic thing
happening and there was always an ET
craft around and they got these on radar
so one night his braid our guy had a new
it was RC a radar system and it was
sweeping around and if they picked up a
craft and so the captain was called came
up they got it he called the command
center and they got it on radar
unfortunately they then hit it with some
kind of electronic weapon or something
and the thing blew up it kind of there
was an explosion in sky and witness fell
straight down into the water this UFO
and the next morning his ship was
vectored into the point of impact and
they couldn&#39;t find the ship but there
was about a six foot square pod that
objected that had four of the et beans
in it and this guy was a
salt-of-the-earth navy guy and he said
well they were handsome little men but
they had their skin was the color of a
Sicilian I never forget him saying it
Sicilian okay and bronze-colored
no hair no Penna which is the the pin is
the flap the monkey ears we have they
just have openings fine lips sort of
small nose and just like the men that
contacted me from skunk works at
Lockheed about the astral projection
experience this person contacted me to
find out something that had bugged him
it&#39;s it stuck in his mind and bothered
him for forty years and he and I said
well what is it he says well we got him
out of this thing this pod they were
ordered to put him in the ship&#39;s freezer
till the submarine nuclear submarine
came along and took them and they were
all threatened with death that they
talked about this and
the he says these little men were in
sort of these metallus eyes a fabric it
was almost metal metal soft metal light
fabric one pieces
I said yeah like onesie but in how many
buttons or zippers and he said they how
could they have gotten in them and I&#39;ve
said this is why you&#39;re calling me and
it was this was exactly why he was
calling me and I said well I don&#39;t know
if you&#39;re gonna like my answer and he
said well tell me I know they damned
things you could have to cut them off
but we couldn&#39;t even cut them I said
well the way that they suit is made they
just stand into an energy field that has
a resonant and it materializes around
them like 3d printing but like a 3ds if
so there are no and it comes off the
same way it materializes off and
materializes on but I said did you
notice anything about this thing that
they were in that you that was floating
anythi said yeah it had no pieces I said
the same thing so I call this sort of a
infra ultrasonic manufacturing where if
you imagine going beyond the speed of
light speed of electrons beyond the zero
point energy field and creating sort of
a architectural blueprint of a
spacecraft that&#39;s in that dimension like
an astral like your astral body and have
that resonate and it comes into this
dimension in toto so it recruits the
atoms the molecules the structures not
by digging them up and smelling them and
banging them and doing rivets like we do
on an airplane but and that&#39;s I call
this extraterrestrial manufacturing 101
that I&#39;m sharing with you so that&#39;s why
the spacecraft the guys who I know who
gone to ones that have retrieved them
they&#39;re seamless now if you see one that
has rivets and seams and parts of it
that&#39;s Lockheed and nor
trips and Boeing&#39;s anti-gravity stuff
but these the et ones are completely
seamless and the light coming from them
is so amazing that&#39;s so pure you never
quite forget it because the light is
coming from a source and materials that
aren&#39;t manufacturable you couldn&#39;t even
manufacture something that pure in space
and there was a part of a craft that
they got in Brazil and I forget it had
meg Meg magnesium and some other stuff
in it but the elements that were in it
were so pure that even in the vacuum of
space we could not manufacture it and no
one understood how they could be doing
this I said because they&#39;re not going to
some asteroid or planet and digging up
stuff out of the earth and smelting it
and melting it and then putting it
together they&#39;re creating a field and it
resonates and then comes in from that
transdimensional virtual ass near astral
I call it the near astral and it then
pops as a totality into 3d makes sense
which if you study the literature of the
craft that have been retrieved and even
the clothing on these beans they&#39;re
consistently this same report now what
is why is that important because it
means that when you&#39;re out under the
stars and you see something and if it
seems just it&#39;s too beautiful to be real
it&#39;s like a jewel
we were once in Colorado and there was
an object it looked like it was up it
looked like it was a crystalline jewel
in the sky and it was there for a number
of minutes and you couldn&#39;t even it was
painful it was so beautiful and then
there was a fighter jet was vectored in
and the thing popped and began to dry go
off looked exactly like a 737
everyone thought so
you know but the what&#39;s what&#39;s
fascinating is is the purity of the
light and the quality of it and then
there&#39;s one more thing these crafts are
imbued at the level of nano
biotechnology you know what that is Nano
about where they&#39;re actually living and
they&#39;re conscious so the craft itself
has the consciousness of the occupants
and often it&#39;s the chief pilot or the
person who&#39;s actually directing it which
is usually they will you touch it and
think and they&#39;ll go alright but the
craft itself is not just like a piece of
machinery it&#39;s actually living and there
have been more than one military guy
I&#39;ve interviewed who have been on
retrieval missions when they get there
and the craft has been injured
I call it injury cause it&#39;s organic and
there&#39;ll be a crack and it&#39;ll be trying
to heal like if you did a cut and did a
time-lapse of a healing of a wound on
skin it&#39;s doing this kind of thing
trying to fix itself and so the craft
themselves are nano bio technology at
the level where they then can subsume or
take on the awareness of the occupants
and that&#39;s how they operate so many
times people have an experience with a
UFO with they&#39;ll feel that the UFO
itself was communicating or was
conscious I said what it is that it was
like this living organic conscious thing
and many times people will dismiss it
and I&#39;ll go no thousands of people who
had the same experience and it&#39;s because
it is it is a living conscious nano
biotechnology at the level that it can
then take on the awareness of the
occupant or the occupants but uses of
the main occupant who&#39;s the
anthropocentric lee projecting here cap
and or the person in charge
you
