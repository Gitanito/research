I felt like I was coming back home and the feeling of happiness coming from the human shapes present was so overwhelming that I have never in my life felt so wanted and loved. In a morbid way, I was mad that I came back because I felt like I had known and loved them all my life. It felt like I was coming back to a place that was a part of me that made complete.
