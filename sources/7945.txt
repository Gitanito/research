I fell and injured my head. I lost consciousness. Then, I was above myself, aware of the injured child. I connected to the injured me in a way I cannot explain.  I was older yet aware of both of us. I could see from both views.

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes      Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   Critical Head Injury

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Mixed

The experience included:      Out of body experience

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  It was like there were two of me. The older version helped the younger.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was unconscious but hyper alert

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     A calmness, brightness, more vivid color. Blue was very prominent

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     Yes an older me

Did you see an unearthly light?       No

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I could see things in a way we can't

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     Yes, but it didn't feel like the younger self had the same knowledge.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Scenes from the world's future     Completely accurate, but happened at a later age

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   The "older" me was very intent on me focusing on what I needed to do to be ok. And I felt in both senses of age an extreme importance  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I never felt like a child of the correct age.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   That I was watching the then me as an older version

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     Many things but only shared two that eventually happened

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I wasn't scared...I was at an extreme level of peace

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Disbelief or indifference

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
