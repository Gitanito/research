THE WRONG FOX SISTER?
[Psypioneer readers may like to consider the
familiar image ‘photograph’ to the right and the
1888 report in The Medium and Daybreak and
its accompanying image, presented below., Ed.]
THE adjoining group representing the celebrated
“Fox Girls,” the mediums through whom Modern
Spiritualism took its rise, was etched from a
daguerreotype—one of the earliest forms of
photography1
—kindly lent to us by Professor L. N.
Fowler, the well-known Phrenologist. While the
writer was associated with Mr. Fowler, about 25
years ago, Mrs. Fowler kindly lent it to have a
negative taken, and after such a long lapse of time, it
is gratifying to be able to place such an “antiquity” in
the present issue of the MEDIUM.2
We have never
heard of another copy of this photographic group, nor
have we heard spiritualists say they had seen one. No
doubt various copies were taken but being on glass
they would necessarily be very limited
in number. It is a difficult picture to
copy by any process; but such as it is,
it gives a most faithful likeness of
these mediums when they were quite
young, and their temperament and
natural character can be studied more
successfully from it, than the flattered
products of the artist’s hand. We
congratulate our readers on being
presented with something of interest,
which no one possesses but
themselves.
James Burns.

Paul Gaunt comments:
What caught my eye was the question mark on the etching; Leah or Lizzie?
By comparison, the similar familiar image ‘photograph’ of the three sisters (L-R Margaret, Kate
& Ann (Leah), has been reproduced in many books and journals. And it is claimed by most as
probably the earliest photograph taken of them. Mariam Bucker Pond 3
asserts this picture was
taken in New York in 1852, from a daguerreotype made in Rochester. It is stated also by others
that it’s a lithograph4
by Currier & Ives 1850c.
What if the ‘third sister’ image is in fact Lizzie?
The etching was published in the Medium just a few months prior to the 1888 Fox confessions. It
is a little surprising why there would have been some doubt as to the identity of either mother or
daughter on the photographic image. Anne Leah’s daughter, Elizabeth ‘Lizzie’ Fish was born
sometime between; 1827-1830.5
Maybe the familiar image ‘photograph’ I have published was
only known in America, giving some difficulty in distinguishing the younger Leah or Lizzie. Or
does it simply suggest that Maggie and Kate were close to their niece Lizzie, so the
photograph could easily have been just a family photograph/daguerreotype rather than
portraits of the famous Rochester Rappers?
But why could it be suggested it may be Lizzie?
Was it a commemorative image! Were all three ladies, that is, Maggie, Kate and Lizzie all
at the Hydesville house at the time of the alleged peddler haunting?
In Fox News 6
I remarked: “………Mrs. Fox stated in her original Lewis statement:—“There was
four of our family, and sometimes five”—it is likely that Mrs. Fox was referring to Leah’s
daughter Lizzie.” I have privately noted over the years that a few old reports do put Lizzie at
Hydesville at March 31st
1848; this I have always regarded as a possible error.
While at Stansted Hall, during my recent research visit, I found in addition to the daguerreotype
etching presented to readers by James Burns, another relevant item also reported in the Medium
and Daybreak.7
If correct, the history of Hydesville as we know it would change significantly:

MARGARET AND KATE FOX
At the thirtieth Anniversary Meeting, held at Grafton Hall on the 17th of April last,
under the presidency of Mr. Enmore Jones, several interesting facts were mentioned in
connection with the two Fox sisters, now Mrs. Kane and Mrs. Jencken, and better known as
Margaret and Kate Fox. Both these ladies were on the platform, and, strange enough to say,
for the first time (that is together) since Spiritualism had its inception at Hydesville, near
Rochester, in the year 1848. At that period the two young mediums were aged four and six
years, and not nine and eleven years, as usually reported in the Spiritualist papers. The true
ascertainment of this fact is so far of interest, as some controversy has been going on from
time to time as to the possibility of these two children answering and carrying out a
systematic deception.
Maggie and Kate, as named, were only four and six years old respectively on the 31st
March, 1848, and at that time resided with their parents in a small wooden house
temporarily occupied by the Fox family until the dwelling on the old family estate of Mrs.
Fox’s father had been completed. A granddaughter of Mrs. Fox (Elizabeth Fish, aged
eleven years) was at that time staying with the grandparents. This older niece was the
questioner with whom the early conversations were carried on with the unseen
communicants, little Katie merely responding by clasping her tiny fingers together.
The error of the ages of these children arose no doubt by confounding the age of the
niece, Elizabeth Fish, with that of either Maggie or Katie.
Two or three years after the first happening of the phenomena Katie Fox was taken
charge of by the Hon. Horace Greeley, the well-known editor of the New York Tribune,
and conveyed to his residence in New York.
For further evidence of the early age of this child a few words from a letter of Mrs.
Greeley may he given. She says, in alluding to these manifestations: “I have had
communications when little Cathie (Katie) Fox has been fast asleep in my arms. I have had
beautiful poetry through her when she was living with me.”
It must be borne in mind that the child Katie Fox was at that time too young to have
conceived poetical thoughts, far less written them or spelt them out by the slow process of
telegraphy by means of raps. All these facts will, however, it is understood, be before the
public when Mrs. Kate Fox Jencken publishes her “Autobiography,” now all but
completed, containing her experiences of Spiritualism from the days of the Rochester
rappings to the present time.

60
The implications of this statement are obviously far reaching; but is it correct? If or not Lizzie
was at home in Rochester with her mother Leah, or at Hydesville with her grandparents at the
time in question is a matter of conjecture. For example Leah makes no reference to taking her
daughter to Hydesville when she first heard about the haunting, but does make reference to
bringing her back home to Rochester with Kate:
“I with the ladies who accompanied me remained about two
weeks, when we concluded to take Katie and Lizzie (my daughter)
with us and return home to Rochester……” 8
The date of Lizzie’s birth I referenced above would make her around 18-21 years of age in 1848;
in the above article it is stated she was aged 11. The ages of all the Fox girls have been an issue
over the years in Psypioneer. In September 2008 Lis Warwood examined the confusing question
of their ages see: - The Fox Sisters: Riddle of the records. 9
Although she was unable to establish
beyond doubt their actual ages, it is the most thorough research known to date. It did show that
they all lied at different times in their lives about their ages!
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Psypioneer September 2005,10
we asked: - What Happened to the Autobiography by Kate Fox
Jencken?
MRS. HENRY D. JENCKEN (Kate Fox), is about to publish her
autobiography, containing remarkable experiences of Spiritual
phenomena from the commencement of the movement of modern
Spiritualism, thirty years ago, to the present time’.
As we noted, then in Psypioneer, as far as we know, the book was never published. And,
we might add now, the whereabouts of the manuscript never ascertained.

Ada Maud Besinnet Roche
1890 – 1936
~~~~~
The Implications of Ada
by
Leslie Price and Paul J. Gaunt
In 1921, Spiritualists in Scotland enjoyed the mediumship of an American visitor, (whose name
was more commonly spelt Besinnet).
Below is taken from The Two Worlds - October 7, 1921 p 471- 472:—
Miss Ada Bessinett at Glasgow
AT the close of Mr. Horace Leaf’s evening lecture to the Glasgow Association on Sunday,
September 25th, Mr. McIndoe made public acknowledgement of the work done for the
Association by Miss Bessinett. He said:
No more uniformly successful and satisfactory series of seances has ever been held under
our auspices. From first to last the results have been mast gratifying, I have heard no
complaints except from those whom we could not admit to the sittings, and our one regret is
that the visit has been all too short.
On behalf of our executive, our Association, and especially on behalf of those who had
the privilege of sitting with her, I offer her our sincere and grateful thanks. It may not be out
of place to refer briefly to the sittings. Each seance has commenced with a display of
physical phenomena which was apparently granted us by the spirit helpers as evidence of the
reality of their presence and their ability to do things, even when hampered by restrictions
which they themselves imposed or accepted, the recital of which would be received with
incredulity in any but an audience of Spiritualists.
The gramophone took the place of the singing which we usually have at seances, and at
every seance spirit hands took part in its manipulation. They have started it, stopped it,
changed the records, changed the needles, done everything but wind it up, and to the
accompaniment of these records we have had the tambourine played all round the circle in
62
perfect time, and the player has frequently shown herself as a beautiful Spanish girl. We have
had singing in childish treble, high and loud. soprano, contralto, tenor and baritone voices;
whistling of such loudness and volume, and sustained for such long periods without a pause
for breath, as to suggest that it could not be emanating from anyone using ordinary breathing
organs. All these things have happened in the dark with the medium sitting free in her chair,
apparently in trance, but they have also occurred with the medium bound in her chair, the
ropes passed round her body and through the back of the chair then tightly round her right
arm, and to make assurance doubly sure, also fastened round the left arm of the man sitting
next her, and the two together bound to the arm of the chair.
Around her mouth a handkerchief has been tightly tied, and all this has been done by the
spirit people. We have turned on the red light and examined closely the tieing, and found it
systematically and thoroughly done. In the dark these phenomena have been repeated
apparently with the same freedom, and we have again turned on the light and found the tieing
intact.
Of course, some of our credulous critics will suggest that Mrs. McKenzie was the author
of these phenomena, there are three conclusive answers to this. The first that she and Miss
Bessinett were so seated in the room between the wall and the table that neither could have
moved from her seat without instant detection; the second is that Mrs. McKenzie’s hands
were frequently being held by some of the sitters while these things were happening; and the
third is that the phenomena occurred just the same when Mrs. McKenzie was not present,
when her place at the gramophone had been taken by Mr. Garscadden or myself.
Now, while I should not like to fix a limit to the possible accomplishments of Mrs. McKenzie,
it will be obvious to all who know us that neither Mr. Garscadden nor I could possibly
masquerade as beautiful Spanish girls, dancing with tambourines, without instant discovery.
But these things prove nothing but the operation of some supernormal forces acting under
intelligent guidance and control, they do not prove that personality and consciousness survive
beyond the grave, and as that is the work which Miss Bessinett and her helpers wish to assist
in accomplishing, these phenomena were the prelude to the manifestations which followed,
when such evidence of the survival of consciousness and identity were offered as to leave no
room for doubt in the minds of those who received it.
And so we have in our midst, and there are scattered throughout the length and breadth of
the land, from far Aberdeen to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Belfast, a goodly quota
who, as the result of their sitting with Miss Bessinett in Glasgow, have been added to the
number of those in our ranks who can say with quiet emphasis and with calm conviction,
“We know, for we have seen, we have felt, we have heard.”
We have seen the faces of our departed friends as the veil was drawn aside for a few brief
moments. Some of them have smiled on us, and very many of us have recognised them
without any shadow of a doubt as to their identity. Our own convictions have been reinforced
as we heard the joyful and confident tones of recognition with which those who stood beside
us welcomed the forms who manifested for them—husbands greeted their wives, parents
63
their children, friends and relations greeted one another. We have felt as well as seen, Felt the
touch of their fingers upon ours, the pressure of their hands upon our heads and shoulders,
the caress of their fingers upon our faces. We have heard as well as seen and felt. Heard them
call to us out of the darkness, some of us familiarly by name. We have answered, and they
have responded with words of loving cheer and encouragement, and they have bidden us
become their messengers and take tidings to their friends of their continued existence, their
enduring love, and the interest and care which they still maintain for their welfare.
They have also left behind more tangible evidence of their presence and identity in the
shape of written communications which, by their purport and contents, tended to establish
the identity of the sender, and that they were intended for the recipient in whose hands they
were placed, and for none other.
So we say we know, and though the whole world should rise in derision and shout that
such things are not, have not been, and never can be, it will make not one whit of difference
to our conviction, for we have had these experiences, and until time for us has ceased to be,
they will remain with us a precious and an indelible memory.
For the privilege of being in a position to make such a declaration, we offer our thanks to
Miss Bessinett, thanks we cannot adequately express in words. We wish her God speed in her
work, health, strength and continued opportunity to pursue it, and when next she returns to
this country or wherever she may go, she will nowhere find a more hearty welcome than that
which most assuredly awaits her when newt she sets foot in Glasgow.
Mrs. B. McKenzie, of the British College of Psychic Science, London, who occupied the
chair, replied on behalf of Miss Bessinet, referring to her development in the home circle
under the watchful care of her foster mother, and spoke to the very valuable work she had
been doing in London. She emphasised the need for guarding and protecting our mediums,
and spoke also of the great dearth of capable exponents to follow up the work of such
demonstrators as Miss Bessinett.

However, behind the scenes at BCPS11
in London, there was a different picture, which was
discussed in Muriel Hankey’s biography “James Hewat McKenzie Pioneer of Psychical
Research”:—12
METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
One of the earliest examinations of physical mediumship conducted by McKenzie after
the establishment of his College, with the co-operation of the research committee, was with
Miss Ada Besinnet, of Toledo, Ohio, during a period of six months from May to November
1921.
Miss Besinnet was a delightful woman, with whom Professor Hyslop had carried out
about seventy test sittings some twelve years previously. He then referred to her mediumship
as “a case of hysteria”. With this Mr. McKenzie disagreed. “The conclusions I have arrived
at from a series of experiments—as careful and as complete as were those conducted by
Professor Hyslop—go to show that those actions of the medium which the Professor
attributed to hysteria may be fully accounted for as due to the action of controlling spirits.
This difference of view may arise from the fact that the medium in 1909 was probably less
developed than at the present moment, and that Professor Hyslop had at the time a very
limited experience of physical phenomena produced through mediumship, most of his
attention having been devoted to the study of mental mediumship, he being not fully
cognisant of the psychic mechanism used by unseen intelligences acting on physical matter,
et cetera.”13
Miss Besinnet’s phenomena were varied. The seances were divided roughly into three
parts. First, direct voice, singing, whistling (all of exceptional quality), tambourine playing
and the appearance of moving lights. Professor Hyslop himself testified that Miss Besinnet
did not sing, play or whistle in her normal condition, and the fact that she could do so in a
state of trance probably contributed to his theory of hysteria. If he was right in this diagnosis,
then many professional “singers” today would benefit themselves and their public if they
would acquire a dose of such hysteria. The second part of the Besinnet sittings was devoted
to the presentation of faces illuminated by a bright light held in her left hand. The third
portion was given to the production of voices in the trumpet, and in writing on pads which
had been placed for that purpose on the table. There were various “controls”, five who
appeared regularly, but McKenzie was not concerned whether they were really spirits or only
secondary personalities built up by the subconscious mind of the medium. His examination
was concentrated on obtaining evidence as to whether Miss Besinnet’s mediumship could or
could not produce physical phenomena by supernormal means.
11
James Hewat McKenzie established in April 1920, the ‘British. College of Psychic Science’ (BCPS) at 59 Holland
Park, London.

McKenzie made positive assertions of several paranormal effects, such as floating lights
revolving round the medium even when both her hands were held, and these lights made no
impression on an exposed photographic plate on which they rested; also he made assertions
about “direct” voices when the trumpet was held in the hands of a sitter, and whistling whilst
McKenzie’s ear was against the mouth of the medium. Nevertheless, the verdict was by no
means one hundred per cent in favour of the medium. The summing-up claimed that eight of
the manifestations were genuine phenomena, four types were doubtful and two were
artificial. This word artificial is particularly useful in bridging the gulf of doubt between
genuine and fraudulent demonstrations, for much that is doubtful may be due to psycho-
logical or other causes and not to deliberate cheating.
Miss Besinnet was abnormally sensitive to light, as is evidenced by several recorded
occurrences which had actual deleterious effects upon her physique. For an instance of this
sensitivity a tiny spot of luminous paint was put on the back of her séance-room gown,
unknown to the medium, but she was totally unable to go into trance. At the next sitting, the
spot having been removed, there was no difficulty at all. Professor Hyslop had found this
same super-sensitivity to light with this medium.
Mr. McKenzie’s report of this investigation, with his ultimate conclusions, contained in
Vol. I, No. I of The Journal of Psychic Science (the Quarterly Transactions of the B.C.P.S.)
is well worth reading and studying, as also are some of the later records of work with other
mediums. He was much criticised by Conan Doyle for his adverse report on A.B. All such
reports will find their detractors, no doubt; it is always easy to spot weaknesses and say what
might, could, or should have been done in certain circumstances, but McKenzie did not
necessarily disclose in print every detail of his methods or the reasons thereof.
The apparatus used at these test seances must sound elementary to the modern researcher,
but even though simple it was efficacious when under direction by McKenzie, and people
trained by him, such as Major Charles Mowbray, who was for a time Research Officer of the
B.C.P.S.
The largest seance room at the College was sparsely furnished, and kept solely for
physical mediumship. It had the usual “cabinet” which was sited in the centre of a long wall,
and consisted merely of two pillars placed a few feet out from the wall, with a curtain rail
from wall to pillars, and across the front; no trap-doors or sliding panels; the curtains and
rails, and, indeed, the whole room, could be freely examined by the sitters. The medium was
not always seated in the cabinet, or, if in it, the curtains were often drawn back, leaving the
medium in full view. This placing of the medium depended upon the type of phenomena
expected to be produced. The reports show that both Miss Besinnet and Frau Silbert sat at the
heavy dining-table, with the observers also seated, and, in Fran Silbert’s case, actually
touching her.
As many of these seances are on record, it is not necessary here to recapitulate the
phenomena, but merely to mention some of the controls imposed as an interesting
comparison with the scientific methods employed by parapsychologists today.
66
The lighting of the seance room consisted of a centre pendant of four lights, with a fifth
bulb hanging below which was red in colour; other lights and rheostats were installed at key
points, and controlled by the responsible officers. Members of the circles maintained hand
contact with their neighbours. There was no need for them to connive at making individual
tests because they had all been taken into McKenzie’s confidence, and had all discussed and
agreed on the conditions to be imposed. Measurements were noted, and phenomena timed
and recorded as they occurred.
_____________
Matters became graver, as can be seen from a later passage in Mrs Hankey’s memoir. (p.142-
4), part of the “Collation of Opinion and Remembrance”:—
HORACE LEAF, F.R.G.S.
Medium, lecturer, teacher, traveller, author.
I knew James Hewat McKenzie at the beginning of the twentieth century. At the time I was a
member of a local debating society in Clapton, North London, at which, along with a number of
other young men, philosophical, political, social, religious and scientific subjects were discussed,
and Mr. McKenzie showed some interest. I did not then know he was a Spiritualist.
At this time he won some local renown as an astute businessman, having purchased the old
tram depot in Clapton, after the introduction of electric trams. It was then that I learned of his
foresight in the future of motoring as one of his aims, afterwards fulfilled, was to establish
garages in suitable places in the metropolis. When I became a Spiritualist and medium, his
interest in me naturally increased, and he and his wife would discuss with me various psychic
problems. I was surprised to learn from him that at one time he had been a successful healer,
using the mesmeric passes system.
Mr. McKenzie and his wife were both very modest people with keen democratic viewpoints
and absolutely no “side”. His success in business in no way altered his complete friendliness, and
he retained this delightful characteristic all his life. Soon after establishing the British College of
Psychic Science, in Holland Park, he invited me to become staff lecturer on psychology and
development of mediumship. Out of that developed my book, The Psychology and
Development of Mediumship, Mr. McKenzie writing the foreword.
Having taken part in several of the various kinds of séances over which Mr. McKenzie, as
College President, presided, I was able to form an opinion of his qualifications as an investigator,
and could find no fault with him and his methods. He visited several countries seeking suitable
mediums, especially those with physical powers, and his choice was invariably good. He told me
that he regarded John C. Sloan, the Glasgow physical medium, as about the best of them. Sloan’s
67
drawback seems to have been his objection to receiving monetary rewards for his mediumistic
work. This made him “a bit of a nuisance”, because, I suppose, one could not give him
instructions.
Mr. McKenzie told me of an amusing and instructive conversation he had with Miss Ada M.
Besinnet, a physical medium from Toledo, Ohio, U.S.A. This remarkable psychic produced different
kinds of phenomena, including singing, whistling, direct voice, materialisations, et cetera all, as far
as I witnessed, in Stygian darkness. Some doubt having been expressed by critics about her
genuineness, McKenzie set up a secret apparatus by which he found that during some of the
manifestations she was not, as she was supposed to be, in her chair. It was concluded that of the usual
series of seven forms of phenomena which appeared to characterise her average seance, during three
or four of them she was active in producing them. In a private interview he had with her, Mr.
McKenzie informed her that she was obviously cheating. Quoting “freely”, the substance of the con-
versation took something of the following form:
Mr. McK: It is you, and not spirits, who produce these manifestations: In other words, you act
fraudulently.
Miss B.: “Mr. McKenzie, if you repeat those words in the presence of others, or in writing, I will
sue for defamation of character. State any time when I have said, either by word spoken or
written, spirits produce my phenomena. I have never made that claim. During all the seance I am
unconscious, and have no knowledge of what takes place. It is you who call me a medium and say
that spirits produce the phenomena.”
Mr. McKenzie examined the correspondence, and recalled his conversations with her, and found
she spoke the truth. Incidentally, I understand that Miss Besinnet never claimed to be a Spiritualist,
any more than Mrs. Leonore Piper did. I knew Miss Besinnet fairly well, having met her in more
than one country, and she impressed me as being one of the most intelligent women whom I met
interested in supernormal phenomena. Personally I regard her as one of the most convincing of
mediums, more because of her mental and physical condition after seances before she left her chair. I
have untied her myself; but what was impressive, she would lie unconscious for some time, without a
flicker of her eyelids, and her body as cold and inert as a corpse. The seance room was invariably
warm. I think Mr. McKenzie took the same point of view.
There is no need to emphasise the sincerity of this Spiritualist, for Mr. McKenzie backed up his
faith with work and money with a generosity that few if any other advocates of Spiritualism have
done.
_____________
68
At least one other sitter contributing to the Collation had strong feelings. (Hankey p.138-9) This
was Dr. Eric J. Dingwall, anthropologist and author, Noted researcher for over fifty years and
former Research Officer of the Society for Psychical Research:—
I was personally acquainted with Mr. McKenzie for many years but never really succeeded in
understanding him. He was a strange mixture, part business-man and part dreamer, and the
combination of the two was responsible for the building up of his British College of Psychic
Science, which opened on April 12, 1920, and where I was a frequent visitor. The problem
before him was to present psychic phenomena to members of the College in such a way that it
would grow into a flourishing institution and might eventually pay its own way. People wanted
to see phenomena, to communicate with those they had lost, and so become convinced of
survival. In three publications McKenzie showed them how to do it. He had not the slightest idea
of the real meaning of scientific work, and possessed but little appreciation of what constitutes
good evidence. The mediums who visited the College had to be paid, and the sitters had to pay to
see them, so it was unlikely that McKenzie would be so strict against the mediums as to frighten
them away, but he did endeavour to take such precautions as he himself thought adequate. His
treatment of the spirit photographer, William Hope, was typical. Although it was strongly
suspected that Hope never produced any genuine psychic effects. Mr. McKenzie defended him
vehemently, and, when looking into Hope’s bag, found apparatus for producing these frauds,
published nothing about it, and the facts only emerged long afterwards.
My own break with him occurred during the visit of the famous American medium, Miss Ada
Besinnet, who visited the College ostensibly as a physical medium of reputation. As a matter of
fact, however, Miss Besinnet had already been the subject of a report in which it was strongly
suggested that her phenomena were produced by herself in a state of mental dissociation, and it
was my opinion at the time that this ought to have been fully explained to the sitters. Mr.
McKenzie, I think, took my criticism as a personal affront to his own integrity and after a
somewhat difficult interview we parted never to come together again in a spirit of mutual
understanding.
Nevertheless I always liked McKenzie. He was full of enthusiasm, liked hard work and in
many ways helped numbers of people to a better understanding of their own experiences. In spite
of his massive credulity and disregard of scientific evidence he was a remarkable example of the
spiritualist business-man; and it is better to remember him for his many good qualities than to
stress his naive belief in Houdini’s “psychic” powers and his stories of conversations with
Shakespeare, Bacon and Euripides.
_____________
69
Another experienced investigator of physical phenomena also expressed his puzzlement. In The
Story of Psychic Science - Hereward Carrington (Rider, 1930 p.141) wrote:—
PSYCHIC LIGHTS
In the presence of certain physical mediums, lights are not infrequently seen. These are
sometimes only as large as big pin-heads; at other times, like small saucers. The smaller lights
usually move about with considerable velocity, while the larger lights remain more nearly
stationary. The former were frequently noted at the seances of Eusapia Palladino, while both
these varieties—together with other puzzling luminous phenomena—were observed at the
Margery sittings, on numerous occasions. They were also noted in the seances of William
Stainton Moses, and many other mediums. In the seances of Frau Silbert, lightning—like flashes
of great brilliance are occasionally seen. In Miss Ada Besinnet’s sittings, a glow is observed over
the centre of the seance table, which gradually increases in brilliance, and is seen to be
illuminating a face, swathed in white material, which is ‘materialized’ over the table. This list
might be extended to include similar manifestations witnessed in the presence of many other
physical mediums.
In a series of sittings I obtained with Miss Ada Besinnet, in 1922, a number of curious lights
were observed, floating about, over the seance table. Inasmuch as practically no control of the
medium was allowed, however, these in themselves could not be considered evidential. But, at
some of the later sittings, naked photographic plates were placed upon the table, in the dark, and
the request was made that the light should hover over the plate for a few moments, when next it
appeared. This was done, remaining visible for several seconds. The plate was then immediately
packed away and developed by the investigators the next day. Upon several of these plates,
curious light—effects were produced; and, without unduly stressing the question of their
supernormality, it may be said that all attempts to duplicate them upon similar plates by means of
draped flash-lights, phosphorescent substances, luminous paint, radium compounds, etc.—
completely failed. I merely state the facts, without attempting to draw any conclusions regarding
them.

In 1934 in This World and Beyond 14
Mrs. Philip Champion De Crespigny expressed her support
of Miss Besinnet. She was by then Hon Principal of BCPS:—
Owing to this dearth of physical mediumship, it was some little time after I came to live
in London before I was brought into contact with any form of “materialization”—beyond
what might be called the half-way house of the direct voice. My first experiences were with
Miss Bessinet from America, when on a visit to the British College of Psychic Science in
its old quarters in Holland Park. I was no longer looking for proof of survival, having ob-
tained enough to satisfy me through the direct voice. My interest was centred in the
14
This World—And Beyond by Mrs. Philip Champion De Crespigny, Cassell & Co. Ltd 1934 pages 169-172.
70
problems presented by the scientific aspect of the subject, and the search for truth along
any lines that offered.
Miss Bessinet’s form of materialization was of an unusual kind. The séance which I first
attended consisted of from ten to twelve persons, seated round a large table with the
medium at one end. Mr. Hewat McKenzie, founder and Hon. Principal of the College at the
time, sat on the medium’s immediate left, and was in control of the gramophone. The
séance was conducted in the dark. Sir Arthur and Lady Conan Doyle were present among
the sitters.
The manifestation took the form of faces, illuminated by an attendant light which, with
the face, remained poised in mid-air in front of the sitter for whom it was intended. The
faces faded and reformed, as materialized objects will, a sort of ebb and flow of the power
that keeps them in being.
The most interesting, because the most convincing point, from my own point of view,
lay in the fact that the “materialized” faces were appreciably under normal size. Judged
roughly, they were about three quarters as large as that of the ordinary adult. Miss Bessinet
is not a small woman; she has a fine face and distinctive features, nor would it have been
possible for her to present it to the sitters either from her chair, or standing at the end of the
table at the particular angle at which each face did confront us. If masks at the end of a
stick, as I have heard it suggested, should be the solution, how would they leave been
imported into the séance-room after the medium had been rigorously searched by expert
investigators?
The faces were the colour of plaster, not so white or luminous as alabaster or marble,
and beautifully moulded—if moulded they were—and in most instances definitely
recognizable. The face that was shown to me was undoubtedly that of my mother. Sir
Arthur also recognized his mother, pointing out, to Lady Doyle, the striking likeness and
tracing the lines on her face in detail.
We were told that each sitter would be drawn to his or her feet for the personal
demonstration. When my turn arrived I felt something that might have been the fingers of a
hand take me by the collar of my coat, and I was lifted on to my feet by a force as
inexorable and impossible to resist as the pull of a steam crane would have been, from
directly above my head. It was not in the nature of the upward hull given by a man’s arm;
there was no give in it. The steady, inevitable force of a steam crane in action is the only
thing to which I can compare it. To have attributed this phase of the phenomenon to action
on the part of the medium would have been an absurdity. Miss Bessinet was seated at least
two yards away from me, with two sitters between her and myself. Any upward pull on her
part from such an angle would have had a forward or sideways inclination—if she could
have reached me at all. The pull which drew me to my feet was from directly above, and
the irresistible power of it inspired me with a lasting respect for the unknown forces with
which we so light-heartedly tamper!
71
Subsequently there were doubts raised as to the genuineness of Miss Bessinet’s
mediumship, and far be it from me to step in where angels have not feared to tread!
But the doubts were based mainly on the fact that on one occasion after the séance,
when the light was turned up, the medium was found to be standing on her feet instead of
sitting on her chair. Now I have seen in good red light the throes and contortions into
which a medium may be thrown before giving birth to ectoplasm, when it was evident that
had she not been securely tied in the chair, she would have been ramping round the room.
Therefore, in the case of Miss Bessinet, from my own personal point of view and in the
light of my experience, my faith in the genuineness of her mediumship remained unshaken.

In 1936, the death of the medium permitted more candid discussions. LIGHT announced on
April 9, 1936 p 231:—
MISS ADA BESSENETT PASSES ON
News comes from America of the passing of Miss Ada Bessenett, the materialising
Medium. Miss Bessenett visited this country in 1921, under the auspices of the
British College of Psychic Science, and gave a long series of sittings, which were
very favourably described by Mr. Hewat McKenzie, in the first issue of Psychic
Science (April 1922). She also gave sittings in Glasgow and Bournemouth. Miss
Bessenett married Mr. Wm. Roche, a Toledo journalist, in 1931; he died in 1934.
_____________
This was too much for Dr Dingwall, who wrote in LIGHT April 23, 1936 p. 267,
perhaps with characteristic mischievousness:—
ADA M. BESINNET
IT was with great regret that I heard of the death of Miss Besinnet, concerning whom you
printed a note in the issue of LIGHT for April 9th, although, through an error, her name was
wrongly spelt.
I knew Miss Besinnet well, and, knowing my rather doubtful nature, she was able to talk
to me quite openly about her phenomena. It was after the scene at the British College for
Psychic Science when one of her sittings was broken up with a torch, that Miss Besinnet
determined never to visit England again. I am not sure whether she kept her resolution; but at
72
any rate she never forgave the outrage, since she could not understand that there were people
who could be so ignorant of her history and her sittings.
Miss Besinnet was never a materialising Medium in the ordinarily accepted sense. Her
“phenomena” were produced by herself in an amazingly skilful manner: the faces of the
“materialised” forms were Miss Besinnet’s face; it was the sitter who built up in imagination
the face of the departed.
I well remember after one of the sittings which I had with her in Toledo, Ohio, that we
had a long, intimate talk until far into the night. “Were all the faces my face to-night?” she
asked me. “Yes,” I replied, “every one.” Did I do it all as usual?” she continued. “I suppose
so,” I said; “why do you ask that?” “Well,” she said, “because my position is so difficult.”
“How do you mean?” I asked. “You see,” she went on, “of course you know the facts, and so
did Professor Hyslop and so does Dr. Pyle, but the public won’t understand, and wouldn’t
come if they did. I’m in trance. I think that the faces are mine and that I’m leaning right over
the table, but my sitters see their own relations and friends—every line of their faces. What
am I to do? I have my living to make.”
It was indeed a problem, and I hope I helped her to solve it. Certain of her phenomena
seemed to imply prior preparation of materials. It was these which puzzled her friends most,
for she had what always seemed to me to be an honest and open nature. Perhaps she
combined her extraordinary faculties with something else. However that may be, she was one
of the most remarkable Mediums of whom we have any record. I am glad to pay my tribute
to her memory.
E. J. DINGWALL.

73
Predictably there was an angry reaction. Thus LIGHT reported on April 30, 1936 p. 279:—
A LETTER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
MISS BESINNET'S MEDIUMSHIP
MRS. MADGE DONOHOE writes expressing her astonishment at Mr. Dingwall’s assertions
concerning Miss Ada Besinnet’s mediumship, and to show how greatly at variance with her
experience is his statement that only one face—the Medium’s—was seen at a Besinnet
seance, she encloses the MS. of an account of one which will appear in a book she is just
now writing on her skotographs. With her permission we append some extracts from it.
After describing a preliminary musical entertainment staged by Black Hawk, Miss
Besinnet’s control, “which would have done honour to any concert hall in the land,” the story
continues:
“The song ceased.A profound silence fell upon us. Mystic lights flashed hither and
thither. Then they, too, were gone. There was nothing but darkness and stillness. The
materialisations were about to begin.
“We had been told that anyone touched in a certain manner was to rise in his seat and,
placing his hands on the table, lean forward as far as possible. I was the first to receive the
signal. I stood up and bent forward as directed—and lo! the incredible had happened. I was
looking into the faces of my two nephews, Egerton and Robert Clunies Ross.
“How long we remained thus gazing into each other’s eyes I cannot say. In one way the
time appeared of infinite duration: my commonsense tells me that it was probably less than a
minute. Then they were gone, and I sank back in my chair. I think I must have lost
consciousness, for I saw nothing of the materialisations which appeared to other sitters.
Mine, being the first, had been seen by all, though not, perhaps, in as definite detail as by
me.”
“For me,” writes Mrs. Donohoe in conclusion, “that Ada Besinnet seance was a milestone
on the path leading to the goal I have now attained—the unshakeable conviction that we do
survive bodily death, and that communication with the inhabitants of the etheric world is as
natural and reasonable as with those of this one. My grateful thoughts will always go out to
Ada Besinnet, Black Hawk and Pansy, and I thank God for them.”

More witnesses testified on May 7, 1936 p. 294ff, and a fellow researcher supported Dr
Dingwall:—
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
A SITTING WITH MISS BESINET
Sir,—In confirmation of the letter you published by Mrs. Madge Donohoe (LIGHT, April 30th
), I
should like to add my testimony as to the character of the seances given by Miss Ada Besinnet.
My sister and I sat with her at the British College of Psychic Science when she was in
England some years ago. The first to appear was an old man, recognised by the sitter on my right
as his father. Next came a girl much more naturally coloured. My sister and I simultaneously
whispered to each other: “Maggie Hyde.” This girl was the niece and an occasional visitor of an
old servant living with us. We knew her but slightly. She had died about five years before.
Certainly she was one of the last persons we should have expected to see.
Next came our mother. Her face was almost too close to ours. We were on the side of the
table opposite to the Medium.Our mother looked at us with an eager expression of keen anxiety
to be recognised. An aunt also appeared.
These were all we got personally, but we saw the figures holding a light to their faces, who
came for other sitters.
My mother spoke to me at some length through the trumpet before the end of the sitting on
items of family matters, and sent messages to persons at home, by name.
A point I wish particularly to emphasise is that the figures appeared directly above the heavy
mahogany table; ending in mist at about knee length, where the light was reflected in the
polished surface. It is impossible that the figures could have been produced by the Medium
leaning over the table—at least on the occasion when I was there.
I cannot do better than end with Mrs. Donohoe’s words: “My grateful thoughts will always go
out to Ada Besinnet, Black Hawk, and Pansy, and I thank God for them.”
S. M. BOWLEY.
ANOTHER READER’S EXPERIENCE
Sir,—Concerning Dr. Dingwall’s article on Miss Besinnet (LIGHT, April 23rd), I had a
sitting with Miss Besinnet at the British College for Psychic Science some 14 years ago, at which
my late wife materialised to the extent of one-half of her face, which I recognised. She caressed
my face with her hand, which was the same soft hand as she had on earth-life, and afterwards
sent me a note that she had showed me part of her face. This is simpler to believe and receive
than Dr. Dingwall’s overstrained theory.
J. W. MACDONALD.
75
“PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLUSION”
Sir,—With regard to the phenomena of the late Miss Ada Besinnet, there is, I think, little
doubt that Dr. Dingwall’s view is the correct one. After a long study of her mediumship, Dr.
Hyslop came to the conclusion that she was an hysterical subject who whistled, sang, moved
tambourines, etc., in the darkness while in a state of auto-hypnosis. Nevertheless, Hyslop
admitted that he was unable to imitate successfully her “spirit-lights” by any means known to
him—though, of course, this does not necessarily mean that the lights were supernormally
produced.
The recognition of the illuminated faces by many sitters was, I believe, a curious example of
psychological illusion. The sudden lighting up of the Medium’s face and the varying intensities
of illumination no doubt combined with an atmosphere of eager expectancy to play strange tricks
with the imagination. What, I suggest, Mrs. Donohoe actually saw were two illuminations of
Miss Besinnet’s face in slightly different positions following each other in rapid succession, thus
producing an illusion of simultaneity. A similar illusion not infrequently occurs at “direct voice”
seances when a supposed “spirit” voice is sometimes imagined to be simultaneous with that of
the Medium.
In 1921, 1 attended three sittings with Miss Besinnet, and my notes are beside me as I write.
On two of these occasions the control, “Black Hawk,” warned me that I was to see the face of “a
young man,” and I naturally expected my brother Frank. In my notes I observe that the “young
man’s” face which appeared for a few seconds at the second sitting was “a distinctly feminine
face resembling in some respects that of the Medium,” while that of the third and last sitting is
described as “undoubtedly Miss Besinnet’s face with a halo of white material draping the head.”
And yet, upon the girl’s face which appeared at my first sitting, I lavished such extravagant
terms as “etherealised as of finer clay,” “grave yet full of personality,” etc., which seem to
indicate that, at first, even I was not immune from the atmosphere of imaginative contagion. The
progressive disillusionment, in fact, is precisely similar to that of a lover who at first is unable to
see the loved object as it really is.
S. G. SOAL.

Another witness testified (and one re-testified) in LIGHT May 14, 1936 p. 310:—
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
MISS BESINNET'S MEDIUMSHIP
Sir,—It is usual when a great Medium passes on for controversy to arise as to the quality of
the mediumship. I say no more about the luminous figures which appeared at the Ada Besinnet
sittings; but I have not heard Dr. Dingwall or other critics express an opinion about the singing
which took place. The voices seemed to be near the ceiling. Some fine duets by a male and a
female voice were given on the occasion when I sat at the British College of Psychic Science.
Could Ada Besinnet sing duets as a man and a woman?
The little spirit girl called “Pansy” apparently moved about the room, talking in a child’s
voice. At one time she seemed to be standing just behind my chair, while she kept up a
conversation about the gramophone with Mrs. McKenzie at the other end of the table. Is it
suggested that Ada Besinnet herself did the voices as well as the materialisations? If not, she
must have been a very remarkable Medium, apart from her even more unusual phenomena.
A well-known clergyman was present. He locked the door of the seance room before the
lights were put out, and he unlocked it at the end of the sitting.
Highgate Road, S. M. BOWLEY.
London, N. W.5.
MRS. DONOHOE REPLIES
Sir,—“Those credulous sceptics! “I cried with Robert Blatchford while reading Mr. Soal’s
letter on Miss Besinnet’s mediumship (LIGHT, 7th May), particularly where he reports Dr.
Hyslop’s conclusion that she was “an hysterical subject who whistled, sang, moved tambourines,
etc., in the darkness while in a state of auto-hypnosis.” I feel sure that, like myself, the great
majority of those who heard the musical items referred to—the unique whistling, skilled
tambourine playing, and above all, the singing (first in a well-trained soprano voice, and then in
a glorious and most powerful baritone)—would brush away as absurd the suggestion that one
frail woman produced them all. Had Miss Besinnet been capable of doing so, she could have
commanded fabulous sums for public demonstrations of her phenomenal gifts. What a star turn
the “woman baritone” would have been! And how immensely foolish, as well as wicked, then,
on her part to waste her time tricking people into the belief that they were listening to spirit
performers!
I cannot accept Dr. Soal’s “explanation” of why I saw two faces. There was no “eager
expectancy” in me to account for it. I had hoped—and prayed—that my elder nephew, Egerton,
might come, but had no thought of seeing the younger, and the surprise was almost
overwhelming in its intensity when their two heads, seemingly poised in mid-air, appeared in
front of me. I could not have been mistaken. Though brothers and bearing a family likeness to
77
each other, they were noticeably different, especially in their way of smiling—and it was their
smiles I saw first and last. Moreover, my neighbours, right and left, confirmed the vision of the
two faces, and later on in the evening Egerton, speaking to me through the trumpet, confirmed it
again. He mentioned by name other dear ones present who had envied him and Robbie their
success in showing themselves. By the way, that conversation was most evidential: I wish space
permitted of my giving it in full.

Finally, LIGHT reprinted what was perhaps intended as an authoritative summing up by
Mrs McKenzie, Hewat having passed in 1929.15
Below is taken from LIGHT August 27, 1936 p. 554 – 555:—
MISS BESSINET'S MEDIUMSHIP
By MRS. HEWAT McKENZIE
In Psychic Science for July-September
NEWS has reached England of the recent passing of the American Medium, Miss Ada
Bessinet, at a comparatively early age. Her visit to the British College, for some months in 1921,
is still a vivid memory to many, as various letters in the current psychic press testify.
Her work at the College was the occasion of an exhaustive report by the Hon. Principal, Mr. J.
Hewat McKenzie, which can be read in the first issue of Psychic Science, Vol. I., April, 1922,
to be found in the College Library.
Miss Bessinet came from Toledo, U.S.A. She had been a private Medium for many years,
having been developed as a girl by her stepmother in a home circle. In 1909-10 Prof. J. H.
Hyslop, of the American S.P.R., investigated her powers, and his report, entitled “A Case of
Hysteria” (the word used in a broad sense), left some points unsettled. Many requests reached
Mr. McKenzie from U.S.A. asking him to endeavour to clear these up, and Miss Bessinet herself
declared that her desire was to have light thrown upon her mediumship. The range of her
phenomena was very wide: trance-control, fine sustained whistling, beautiful singing, both in
clear-cut soprano and baritone voices, highly-skilled tambourine playing, gifts which it was
stated the Medium did not normally possess and was never found rehearsing. In addition, there
was direct voice and trumpet voice, direct writing, and the brief appearance of faces, self-
illumined by a fair light, presented as and often claimed by sitters as recognisable likenesses of
deceased friends.

James Hewat McKenzie: November 11th
1869-August 29th 1929. See:—KNIGHT ERRANT OF PSYCHIC
SCIENCE JAMES HEWAT McKENZIE. Psypioneer Volume 3, No.8 pages 169-178: —
http://woodlandway.org/PDF/PP3.8August07..pdf
78
The claim was made by the Medium and her friends that these phenomena were objective,
separate from the Medium’s physical possibilities; they all took place within a short radius of the
Medium as she sat with the sitters round a large table, separated from the nearest sitter on her left
hand by a gramophone kept in constant use during seances, which were always held in complete
darkness. The general sittings open to members were remarkably uniform in method and quality,
there was never a blank sitting, and apart from variations in the messages they might have been
cut from a stereotyped pattern; these were highly pleasing to sitters because of the abundance
and quality of the phenomena, always pleasant and harmonious, and if “Black Cloud,” the chief
control, was at times rather surly and uncommunicative, this was amply compensated by
“Pansy’s” cheerful and chatty personality.
A Research group composed of the College Council and selected members met once a week
for special investigation, and it is upon the reports of this group, of which he was the director,
that Mr. McKenzie's record depends. Miss Bessinet herself was charming to deal with, modest as
to her work and unspoiled by adulation, careful of her life so that her work might not suffer, and
apparently ready to assist the investigation; but to deal with “Black Cloud” was another matter,
he offered little co-operation or advice when consulted, and seemed to resent any suggested
change in the usual procedure. The trance state was undoubted, and while under it the Medium
moved in her seat or “was moved” in the most noiseless fashion, so that those who sat next to her
would declare that it was quite out of the question to think so; a hidden electric connection with
her chair proved, however, that she did so continuously during the singing, the whistling, the
tambourine playing, and when the faces were presented. At one stage of the séance the guides
used a rope for binding the medium for added proof; this was done in the dark in a most skilful
manner, but it was found that a carefully arranged slipknot allowed the Medium to release and
return one hand, thus leaving her free for manipulations.
As many claimed recognition of the faces presented to them, recognitions often endorsed and
confirmed by the trumpet voice, this phenomenon and the illumination used had to be tested, for
many other experienced sitters, including the Research group, Mr. McKenzie, and myself, who
had viewed the faces scores of times, seeking recognitions with the greatest sympathy and
anticipation, had never been able to see anything but Miss Bessinet’s own face presented at
different angles and draped in various fashion with some white material which could not be
regarded as ectoplastic.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Lady Doyle, who sat with Miss Bessinet on several occasions,
testified to having seen the face of his mother and another relative in unmistakable fashion,
others claimed to see two faces at the same time. At the last seance of the series it was agreed by
the Research group that a weak red light should be turned upon the Medium when the faces were
presented. Full responsibility was assumed by the group and the Principal for this procedure,
which in view of other defects discovered in the mediumship was considered necessary. The
Medium was found standing up and leaning across the table towards a sitter with a light
surrounding her, but the usual drapery was absent. No appliance for producing the light was
discovered. Miss Bessinet was nervously upset by the occurrence for several days, and also by
the relating of what had been witnessed. Her defence was that she was in trance and trusted her
guides, and had always been told by her home group that the manifestations were objective to
herself. If the year had been 1936 instead of 1921 the use of infra-red photography would have
79
made such procedure unnecessary, though few physical Mediums yet avail themselves of this
opportunity of verifying their work. In voice seances, for instance, many messages are
considered evidential, but many doubt that these are delivered by an independent voice, or that
the movements of the trumpet in the dark are beyond suspicion. Every Medium who presents
himself or herself to the suffrages of the Spiritualistic public should be utterly willing to take
advantage of this new opportunity in the interests of his own integrity. Until this is volunteered
by the conscientious sensitives, the present very unsatisfactory condition of physical mediumship
will remain.
Miss Bessinet returned to the States, and before leaving England was seriously advised by
Mr. McKenzie to seek co-operation from her group and her guides in placing her work on a
satisfactory basis as far as objectivity rested. Her friend, Mr. Wm. Roche, Editor of the Toledo
News Bee, was also communicated with; Miss Bessinet subsequently married Mr. Roche, who
predeceased her in 1934. Reports of subsequent seances came to our notice from time to time
apparently under the old conditions. At one I remember it was claimed that a face was clearly
recognised as that of Sir Ernest Shackleton by a sitter who knew the explorer. The kindest
interpretation as to these variations of opinion as to the faces is that on occasions a vivid
transfiguration of the Medium’s features occurred, as has been observed with others. Such
changes I believe depend on the psychic force supplied by individual sitters, which, in
collaboration with the will of a communicator, may momentarily clothe the Medium's face with a
resemblance to one who has gone; others who do not supply such force, or if they do it cannot be
co-ordinated at the moment, see only the face of the Medium.
Again, there are mediums who seem to have the power of projecting a manifestation
a considerable distance from themselves, others can only do so at a much shorter range,
while others with similar dynamic force working through them cannot project it at all, and yet
in trance may simulate the manifestations by means of their own organs and limbs. Such
Mediums are to be sincerely pitied if they have not secured a group or guides who will be honest
and frank with them about what is really taking place. From this point of view, Miss Bessinet
may have been sincere in her protestations and she herself the victim.
It is for investigators of the present day, when opportunity allows, to use the fresh facilities
available and improve on the methods of the past, and I have briefly outlined this case to recall
to our minds what a serious and difficult task is involved in the scientific investigation of
mediumship. But if the researcher can add one grain to our knowledge he is to be praised.
In the midst of controversy, I remember gratefully the pleasure and comfort Ada Bessinet
gave to many, and the cheerful and courageous spirit she showed in her work.—(Reprinted, by

Note by LP:—
We have now placed varying evidence before the reader, though the specialist will also want to
read the full reports mentioned; and it is tempting to say “If we are not confused, we have not
understood the nature of the problem.” The medium was entranced, but some of the sitters,
including some Spiritualists, thought that she or her spirits were faking certain phenomena,
though not necessarily all. They believed this even though she was a very nice person. We
cannot say “Oh well, sceptics will be sceptics” because whatever else Hewat McKenzie was, it
was not sceptical. No one who published a handbook giving the precise location of Summerland
as 1350 miles from the earth could be called skeptical (see Psypioneer June 2007, p129.16
)
It is clear however that with the technology employed, there was no way of settling the question.
We should therefore consider the possibility that Miss B., while entranced, was led to do things
of which the conscious Miss B. knew nothing, and also that there may be other mediums in the
same category, past and present.

Important work is being undertaken in the Netherlands for future generations:—
Preserving the History of Parapsychology &
Spiritism in The Netherlands
By Wim Kramer 17
Introduction to part one:—
The purpose of this article is to present an insight in a project in The Netherlands to preserve
historical journals, books and archives on parapsychology and spiritualism. We noted that in the
past five to ten years a lot of historical materials like correspondence, archives, journals and
books have been lost for ever, since nobody really cared enough to actively try to preserve them.
The exceptions of course are some private collectors. However this category has the
disadvantage that they often specialize in a very narrow topic—thus neglecting many topics that
are important from the point of view of the history of science and culture—and that they do not
make their collection publicly available to researchers. They may even try to keep secret what
they possess in their collections.
Moreover, every collector has a ‘limited time frame’ and thus often ‘by the end of the day’ the
collection that was carefully built up and maintained for years suddenly ends up in the old paper
basket thrown out by relatives who do not care about it. In the best case relatives will try to sell
parts of it to antiquarian book dealers. If this is the case often the precious books and journals
start a new life as an ‘object of desire’ and represent now financial value as an economic asset
instead of the original scientific value that is purely based on the contents.
In 2007 it was decided to start a project to try to stop the destruction of the heritage of
parapsychology and spiritism. A project plan was made and thanks to generous support of the
Dutch ‘Het Johan Borgmanfonds’ Foundation (HJBF), resources became available to begin. One
of the most important success factors for a project like this is the availability of suitable space for
all the logistics involved like collecting, storage,
investigating and preparing the materials to be
shipped in and out. After searching for several
months we were lucky to find a perfectly suited office
and storage space. A small office building in the
centre of the Netherlands became available. Located
in a remote and very quiet neighbourhood, the
entrance is on street level, a private parking lot with
much space, a small kitchen, a toilet, burglary alarm
system and three office rooms giving in total about
120 square meters of useable floor space.

What do we collect:
To protect ourselves from ‘overflow’ or ‘loss of track’ in the project, being two pitfalls that are
very easily encountered in a large scale project such as this, we limited our hunger for collecting
all kinds of materials by some rules of thumb. The first one is that the materials must be related
to the history of Dutch parapsychology and psychical research as science, or as typical examples
of a cultural phenomenon representing the ‘Zeistgeist’ thus the ‘spirit of the time’.18
We
restricted ourselves not to collect all kinds of popular ‘mumbo jumbo’ books and magazines,
since this will give an overflow very easily and will cost us to much time and space. The Dutch
National Royal Library has, based on national laws, since 1972 the obligation to keep one copy
of all books and magazines that are published in the Netherlands in depot. Also they have a
program to collect as much as possible books and magazines published in The Netherlands
before 1972. This means that most popular books and magazines on the subject of
parapsychology and esoteric topics are already available in their depot.
Our second rule of thumb is to focus on international scientific parapsychological publications.
The rational behind this is that these publications are very rare in Holland. Only professional
parapsychologists will have them and since all of the first generation and most of the second
generation of these parapsychologists have died already, many of these rare publications have
been lost. Often they were simply been thrown away by relatives—on Saturday morning when
the old paper is collected—who were under time pressure to clear out the house as soon as
possible and have no interest themselves in these materials or even the topic.
Public availability:
The output of our project is three fold. First, to maintain and preserve the materials for
perpetuity. Second to make them publicly available to everyone who is interested to read or
study them, and third there must be some sort of catalogue publicly available, preferably on the
internet. The only way in the Netherlands to fulfil these three requirements is to hand over these
books, journals and magazines to a professional library and to offer archive materials to the
Dutch National Archive or to one of the Dutch regional archives.
As for the libraries, we considered the Dutch National Royal Library in The Hague19
and the
University Libraries in The Netherlands to suit us best. In this way the materials are publicly
available to everybody and, in the case of University libraries, they are located near the scientific
communities that might use them most for scientific research or in student projects on Bachelor
or Master level.
18
We also restricted ourselves not to collect Theosophical publications, publications on Free Masonry or
publications dealing with the Hermetic tradition. The reason is that these fields are already covered by other
institutions and libraries in The Netherlands and thus publications are already available to the general public. In
Amsterdam there are the Theosophical library (see: www.theosofie.nl ) and the Ritman library (see:
www.ritmanlibrary.nl). Both are very well equipped with impressive collections and are open to the public. For Free
Masonry the main office and museum is in The Hague (see: www.vrijmetselarij.nl).

Unloading books and journals at the Dutch National Royal
Library in The Hague This shipment contained a large
collection of rare British Astrological journals.
In the past two years we have handed
over tons of materials to the Dutch
National Royal Library in The Hague
and to the Groningen University
Library in Groningen,20
which is
located in the far Northern part of the
country. The additional advantage of
the choice of these two institutions is
that now collections are available not
only in the western and middle part of
The Netherlands, but also in the far
Northern part of the country.
Origins:
All this sounds great but is useless if there are no sources that will supply materials. Luckily
however, reality showed us very soon that we were ‘right on the spot’ in time for a project such
as this In the past years considerable amounts of materials were lost by simply being thrown
away due to lack of space and interest. Some scientific parapsychologists considered
spiritualistic journals and books to be obsolete and of no value at all anymore to science, so (they
reasoned) why keep that rubbish on your shelf or in the library of the institute? However some
collections of books and archive materials of Dutch parapsychologists in 2007 still existed, being
stuffed in cold, damp cellars and on badly isolated attics having often been stored there
unattended for many years.
When we started our project, it worked like a magnet. Suddenly from all corners of
parapsychological society in Holland there was a positive response and with great pleasure
people handed over materials in their possession to include in our project. Also the Dutch society
of spiritualism ‘Harmonia’, established in 1888,21
had a ‘locked room’ in their headquarters
building filled with archives, books and journals that in essence had been stored in the past and
not been touched for decades; they decided to join us. This of course was a great advantage since
now also early spiritualistic books, journals and magazines became available. Another great gift
came from Miss Lisette Coly of the Parapsychology Foundation in New York.22
She sent us free
of charge copies of all titles in the PF Proceedings and Monograph series to include in our
project. The PF intends to send magazines and journals published by them in the past which are
missing in our current collection later this year. More international gifts were received.

Eleven boxes filled with books and
journals including the almost complete
collection of the Proceedings of the
SPR, handed over to the University
Library in Groningen in June 2009.
Alejandro Parra from Buenos Aires23
handed over free copies of the Argentina parapsychological
journal to me in November 2009. Early March of this year the British SPR24
sent me nine boxes
filled with copies of international parapsychological journals that do not fit any longer in their
library collection.
Last but not least we are very pleased with the recently obtained two volumes of rare
spiritualistic publications being volume 6 of 'The Carrier Dove', an illustrated weekly journal
published in San Francisco back in 1889 and the 1848 (yes indeed that old!) volume of the ‘The
Univercoelum and Spiritual Philosopher’, a biweekly journal of Andrew Jackson Davis and Dr.
Samuel Byron Brittan published in New York. These two precious publications were made
available to our project by the editor of Psypioneer for an extremely generous and moderate
price. Although in general we do not pay for materials since there is no budget available, in this
particular case we decided to make some money available out of our working budget since it
truly would be money well spent: Not only we were able to add two extremely rare journals to
our project—journals that will otherwise never be available at all in Holland—but also the editor
uses the money to keep Psypioneer alive and ‘on the net’ maintaining free subscriptions for
everyone.
The libraries:
The Dutch National Royal Library already had a rather
impressive collection of, as they call it, esoteric,
publications. However, this collection was far from
complete and mainly based on the gift of two estates.25
The
first collection received in 1939 was the estate of Mr. RA
Reddingius (1866 – 1939) a Dutch medical doctor. The
second gift in 1990 originated from the collection of
George Zorab, (1898 – 1990) an international known Dutch
parapsychologist.26
The total amount of books and journals
based on these two estates is about one thousand. Our
additional gifts of the past two years have completed
several series that were already partly available but also
brought in many new series and even journals that were
not even known to the ‘big’ general Dutch database used
by all libraries in Holland.
As for the University of Groningen library they only had a
moderate and incomplete collection of parapsycholgical

books on Occultism. Some publications ranging back to the 1600’s.

publications and almost no publications on spiritism. Thanks to our recent additions they were
able to set up a more serious collection of scientific parapsychological journals. This year we
will continue to submit materials to both libraries in order to complete and extend the two
collections.
Oldest publications:
The oldest publication we were able to submit to the Dutch National Royal Library last year was
a Dutch book dealing with Astrology by Mr. Ludeman published in 1795 and thus printed on
parchment instead of paper. The second oldest book was printed and published in London by
Davis and Dickson, dealers in scientific books, in 1822. It was a translation from the Greek of
“Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos” by J.M. Ashmand, which also discussed the ‘influence of the stars’.
Both these publications came from the collection of Jan Kappers (1914 – 2001), a medical doctor
from Amsterdam who had been very active in parapsychology since World War II and was well
known and respected by the international parapsychological community.27
To be continued:
In the second part of this article we will give details on what is submitted already to the two
libraries and what they can expect from us in the near future. In a third part of this article we will
discuss some unique archive materials that were recovered in the past two years, including
correspondence from Dutch Spiritists and mediums of the early 20-th century, and historical
films of the late 1940’s of the famous Dutch healer and psychic Gerard Croiset (1909 – 1980),
demonstrating his healing powers.
