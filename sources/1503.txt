Versus
Simon P. Kase
PART TWO:—
Considering the worldwide attention that has been given to “Was Abraham Lincoln a
Spiritualist?” by Nettie Colburn and to earlier accounts by Simon Kase, there is little ready
information as to what actually happened and if the scattered reports are authentic.
There is to my knowledge only one investigation into the accounts where the information is
collated—by the prominent American psychical researcher, Dr Walter Franklin Prince (1863-
1934),2
but this has remained rather obscure. Prince’s research was published by the Society for
Psychical Research (SPR) in their Journal (JSPR) December 1930,3
then a private publication
unlike its Proceedings. We express our thanks to the SPR for supplying Psypioneer with a
photocopy which we re-publish below. (There were also some comments on this by Leslie Price

THE AETIOLOGY OF A “PSYCHICAL”
LEGEND
BY DR WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE
FOR half a century a certain story, in one or another form, relating to Abraham Lincoln, has
been in circulation, and I do not remember to have seen in print any refutation. At last it has
come to pass that a book entitled The History of Spiritualism 5
boldly affirms:
“We may fitly end this short review of the early days in America by an event where spirit
intervention proved to be of importance in the world’s history. This was the instance of the
inspired messages which determined the action of Abraham Lincoln at the supreme moment of
the Civil War. The facts are beyond dispute......” And it has come to pass that a magazine
purporting to be devoted to research 6
declares: “There is a remarkable story extant in regard to
the influence which led Lincoln to conceive the idea of emancipation and to act upon it by the
issue of his famous proclamation. It seems authentic and if so, it deserves to be widely known.”
When a legend has reached the point that it is sponsored by what to many readers are authorities,
when it then attracts editorial attention from the Boston Herald, and revives in Spiritualist 7
and
other periodicals, it is time to confront it with an array of historical facts, and of interest to trace
it to its origins.
The learned writer of the magazine article says that “the credit for the preservation of this
story is due to Mrs M. E. Williams,”8
and after grateful acknowledgment that “our thanks are due
to this lady for her kind permission to reproduce the story,” proceeds to reproduce it as embodied
in a pamphlet by Mrs Williams, and, she declares, told by Colonel S. P. Kase 9
of Philadelphia to

E.g., Light (London, 26 April 1930), 1. 199.

Mrs Williams, the author of the pamphlet referred to (Abraham Lincoln Facts Indisputable, 4th ed.), was invited by
prominent French Spiritualists, in 1894, to give sittings for the materialization of spirits in Paris, and planned a tour
over Europe, which was suddenly terminated by her exposure in that city, in the Ironic of a Spiritualist, by Spiritualists,
including M. Leymarie, of the Revue Spirite. She was “grabbed” and found in the pantaloons and other garments
appropriate to a male spirit, and the mask and drapery which stood for another spirit, and other apparatus, were
discovered. The whole matter was published in a special supplement to Light (1894, xiv. 545-52; cp. xiv. 566-9), and
was extensively printed in American journals. I may instance the New York Sun of 23 November 1894, which
published cuts from photographs of the paraphernalia. The lady has since had a variegated career. Within the last
decade a clergyman and his wife, acting under my instructions, twice caught her impersonating a spirit.
9
“Col. Kase was a very prominent Spiritualist of the more credulous type. I have an abundance of material showing
that he was deceived by some of the most notorious tricksters of his time. His reports of what took place in his presence
were so far from the facts that I would not trust his memory or judgment for anything he said on the subject of Lincoln
and mediums, because I would expect that any interest which the President showed in the way of trying out mediums
would be exaggerated and warped out of semblance to the reality. The fact that Col. Kase was “fully assured in his own
31
her, and set down at her request so that it should not be lost to posterity. This version, in honour of
Mrs Williams, who is thus credited with its salvation from oblivion, we will call the W-version.
According to the W-version, then, Col. Kase obeyed a voice which told him, as he was walking
on a street in Washington, to enter the house of a medium named Conkling, who at once engaged
him to carry a letter written by himself (Conkling) to the President. Conkling, however,
accompanied Kase, but remained in an adjoining room while the latter, equally a stranger to
Lincoln, presented the letter which stated that its writer had been sent “by spiritual influences to
confer with you regarding the interests of the nation.” Lincoln consented to see Conkling and did
so the following Sunday. Four weeks later Kase was present one evening in a certain house,
together with President and Mrs Lincoln and other persons, when a young girl advanced toward
Lincoln with closed eyes and said: “Sir, you were called to the position you occupy for a very great
purpose. The world is universally in bondage. It must be physically set free, so that it may mentally
rise to its proper status. There is a spiritual Congress supervising the affairs of this nation as well as
a congress at Washington. This republic will lead the van of republics throughout the world.” This
is as Col. Kase remembered it at this telling, and he added: “This was a text on which she lectured
the President for a full hour and a half, dwelling strongly on the importance of the emancipation of
the slaves; saying that the war could not end unless slavery were abolished.” He also thought he
remembered hearing “the child” predict that the North would undergo no military reverses after the
issue of the proposed proclamation. Then “the little girl” woke, and a lady began to play the
piano.10
Finally, according to Kase, Lincoln, a few weeks afterward, issued the proclamation, to
take effect on 1 January 1863, and Kase was quite certain that he was caused to do so by the
message through “the child.”11
But it happens that the world does not owe such a debt of gratitude to Mrs Williams, after all.
Many years ago, at a time when that lady’s illustrious career was not far advanced, Col. Kase told
the story to Mrs Emma Hardinge Britten, who embalmed it in her Nineteenth Century Miracles
(1884, pp. 484-7) published in 1884. This we will call the B-version. Moreover, as Mrs Britten
informs us, the tale had been told by him still earlier, and printed in a Spiritualist paper called the
Spiritual Scientist, and the B-version includes extracts from that organ.
There are many discrepancies between the two versions.12
According to B “the President looked
somewhat disappointed,” and it is explained that the name sent in, S. P. Kase, gave Lincoln the
mind” that Lincoln was influenced by messages through a medium to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, weighs
little in view of the cases of fakery of whose genuineness he was also fully assured.
10
At this point the magazine omits the only sentences of the Colonel which make the piano interesting; his statement
that one side of it hopped four inches above the floor, in time to the music, and continued to do so with four men
roosting upon it.
11
It may also be noted that according to Mrs Williams’s pamphlet Mrs Maynard was for two years, 1863-1865,
“engaged exclusively by President Lincoln, and made her home in the White House where she gave the President
seances almost daily.” This is a fearful perversion of the facts, as measured by the statements of Mrs Maynard herself,
who claims to have given “a number of seances with President Lincoln and his wife” in February and March 1864,
and mentions only seven other meetings with him, several of which were casual only.
12
One queer item of Kase’s story may be noted in passing. He reported that he advised the President to write a letter to
Conkling making an appointment with him, although all the while that gentleman was sitting in an adjoining room. To
32
impression that S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, had called. According to W, the President
was “apparently a little frightened,” and it is explained that Kase much resembled George
Washington (to meet whom, in 1862, one would naturally be a bit startled). In each version Kase
purports to give a copy of the letter; the two are not verbally identical, although essentially so.
The versions of the trance address verbally differ more widely, although the trend of thought is
similar. This is shown by the first sentences of B: “You, sir, as President of the Republic, are called
to the position you occupy for a very important purpose. The world is not only groaning under the
weight of mental and spiritual bondage, but four millions, made in God’s image, are enduring
physical slavery. Their yokes must be broken, the fetters must be severed,” etc. And by a sentence
farther on: “This civil war will never cease; the shout of victory will never ring through the North,
will never reverberate along the valleys of the South; the olive-branch of peace will never wave
over your fields, and lakes, and mountains, till you issue a proclamation of freedom—a
proclamation that shall set forever free the enslaved millions of your distracted country.” The effect
of all this eloquence, says Col. Kase, “was that President Lincoln was convinced as to the course
he should pursue; the command coming from the all-seeing angel world was not to be overlooked,
so like a faithful servant, when convinced of his duty, he feared not to do it and to proclaim
freedom by the Emancipation Proclamation to four millions of slaves. That Proclamation was
issued on September 22, 1862, to take effect the first day of January, 1862.”[Should read 1863]
I have no objection to any proof the “all-seeing angel world” may give as to the validity of its
messages, but should lose something of my respect for Lincoln if he accepted a mere mediumistic
harangue as proof. Still, if this is history, we must accept it. Fortunately the good Colonel said
something else, which enables us to estimate his reliability as a historian.
In the version told to Mrs Williams, he added: “I believe we had twenty-six battles after this
great event [the preliminary proclamation of 22 September], and all were successful on the
Union side except possibly one or two unimportant skirmishes.” This affirmation seemingly
applies to the remainder of the war, and is an egregiously mistaken one. Of major defeats which
the North afterward underwent there may be cited the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville,
Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, Petersburg. Grant fought battle after battle with Lee in the
Wilderness campaign, which battles certainly were not victories. Among minor defeats may be
listed the battles of Drury’s Bluff, Olustee, Sabine Crossroads, Pleasant Hill, Pine Mountain,
Kenesaw Mountain, New Market. If the Colonel was capable of such contradiction of public
records of his own day, how could one rest content on his uncorroborated story of an unrecorded
mediumistic speech which took place years before the telling?
In the B-version, we find the Colonel saying that it was, not through the rest of the war, but
“in the intermediate time” between the two proclamations that there occurred twenty-six battles,
and now he says that “every one of them was a success upon the Union side.” By the time of the
W-version his formula had somehow got twisted, but the earlier one was only a shade less false.
For between 22 September 1862 and 1 January 1863, came the terrible Union defeat of
Fredericksburg, the defeat of Sherman at Vicksburg, the failure of Rosecrans at Stone River, the
those who remember how accessible Lincoln was it is incomprehensible that, having become interested in Conkling, he
did not call him in then and there.
33
stalemate of even the iron-willed Grant, and on the very day of the final proclamation the rebels
broke the blockade of Galveston. Instead of being a period of victory it was one of special gloom
for the North.
Considering that Kase was able to imagine and allege a military Utopia which never existed,
that he apparently recorded not a line of the trance address and only vaguely attempted to fig its
date as “some three or four weeks” before the preliminary proclamation, that he told his story
years after the proclamations and the war and Lincoln’s death had passed into history, and that
the sentences attributed to the medium cannot be verbally correct or they would not so markedly
differ in the two versions, even if I knew no more, I should say that without impugning Col.
Kase’s honesty in the least, I could only infer from his yarns that the medium probably said
something about freeing the slaves, about the war and about the country.
But I do know something more, as does every person familiar with American history, and that
is, that on 22 July 1862, Abraham Lincoln read to his Cabinet the draft of a preliminary
proclamation of emancipation, fully a month before, according to Kase, he listened to the trance-
address from “the all-seeing angel world” which (still according to Kase) first convinced him
that such a proclamation should be made. The only reason it was not actually issued that, month
was because it was thought best to defer it until after a Union victory. When Lee had been
checked in the battle of Antietam, 16-17 September, it was determined that a fit time had come.
This explodes the legend thoroughly.
But there is more to learn. In the B-version we find that the medium was Nettie Maynard
(really, at that time, Nettie Colburn). And she, as it happens, thirty-nine years ago wrote a book
entitled Was Abraham Lincoln a Spiritualist? (Philadelphia 1891). Mrs Nettie Colburn Maynard
included in this book her version of what happened on the same evening with Lincoln which
Kase had in mind, and of the trance-address. She had every motive not to minimize the facts.
The first particular which strikes our attention is that the medium, whom Kase remembered as
“a little girl,” (he calls her this thrice, and says that she reminded him of the scriptural passage
about “babes and sucklings”) in 1862, was, according to her own testimony, “a mere child” in
1845, and that she began to engage in public lecturing in 1856. That is, she was probably not less
than 22 years old, and very likely older, when she delivered the celebrated trance oration.”13
The next fact which we discover from her testimony is that the trance address, the first time
she ever saw President Lincoln, was not some time in August, as Kase remembered it (although
even that date was fatal to the claim that she inspired the preliminary proclamation), but
sometime in December 1862.14
But the preliminary proclamation had been issued more than two
13
Mrs Maynard also told of the terpsichorean piano but stated that its saltations occurred before her oration, not after it
as according to Col. Kase.
14
A little chronology will be useful, to show the slow evolution of the idea of emancipation in Lincoln's mind.
Lincoln from the beginning of the war favoured compensated emancipation.
He brought about a joint resolution of Congress to pay for the slaves of any state not in rebellion, and signed it 10 April
1862.
16 April he signed an act abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. .
12 July 1862 he met a delegation from the border States and urged that these accept compensated emancipation.
34
months before, and this had declared that on 1 January 1863, all slaves in States then continuing
rebellious would be legally free. The absurdity of claiming that Nettie brought about the act
already in esse, or the one already in posse, needs no accentuation.
But Nettie herself does not make the claim, or anything like it. She admits that she knew that the
final Proclamation was at hand. This is her entire account of the address, the parts she thought most
important italicised as she italicised them. Beginning with the statement that no one but Lincoln
seemed to understand her “until that portion was reached that related to the forthcoming Emancipa-
tion Proclamation,” she goes on thus: “He was charged with the utmost solemnity and force of
manner not to abate the terms of its issue, and not to delay its enforcement as a law beyond the
opening of the year; and he was assured that it was to be the crowning event of his administration
and his life, and that while he was being counselled by strong parties to defer the enforcement of it,
hoping to supplant it by other measures and to delay action, he must in no wise heed such counsel,
but stand firm to his convictions and fearlessly perform the work and fulfil the mission for which
he had been raised up by an overruling Providence.” 15
Here is not a word about the world being universally in bondage, or about the impossibility of
the war ending unless slavery should be abolished, or about victories which would result, or any of
the hifalutin contained in Kase’s two versions. She first saw Lincoln more than two months after
the preliminary proclamation and within a few weeks (nobody gives exact dates) of the final one,
which was already absolutely determined upon, and which nothing short of the surrender of the
13 July he told Secretary Welles that after much thought he had about come to the conclusion that it was a military
necessity to proclaim freedom to all the slaves.
17 July he approved an act freeing slaves under certain military conditions.
21 July he read to the Cabinet a draft of a proclamation of emancipation to become effective on 1 January 1863, but it
was judged best to postpone it until after a Union victory.
6 August he signed an act freeing all slaves employed in rebel military service.
13 September he made a long reply, which has been preserved, to a committee from Chicago religious bodies urging him
to issue a proclamation of emancipation. In it he gave no hint of his intentions.
22 September he issued the preliminary proclamation, following the battle of Antietam, giving notice that on 1 January
1863, all persons held slaves in territory then in rebellion should be free.
1 December he again urged his plan of gradual compensated emancipation. This producing no results, on 1 January 1863
he issued the final Emancipation Proclamation.
15
Since Mrs Maynard turned from the temptation of endorsing Kase’s claim that she inspired Lincoln to emancipate the
slaves and told so tame a story of what occurred, her honesty is beyond question. However, one is not compelled to accept
her inference that since Lincoln glanced at Webster’s portrait on the wall he implied a conviction that the “Defender of the
Constitution” had been addressing him, nor that her memory of the conversation which ensued was verbally exact. I do not
believe that an intelligent official asked the President if pressure had been brought to bear upon him to “defer the
enforcement of the Proclamation.” That word enforcement echoes the medium’s naive assumption that the President
could give the impending Proclamation immediate effect in the actual liberation of the slaves in rebellious States. Conse-
quently it is unlikely that Lincoln replied: “It is taking all my nerve and strength to withstand such [my italics] a pressure,”
though he may well have said that there was opposition to his plan. And did not the medium know that? His message of 1
December to Congress had been printed in the newspapers, and that had said that “among the friends of the Union there is
great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some would perpetuate
slavery; some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation; some would abolish it gradually and with com-
pensation,” etc. The public knowledge of these utterances deprives the trance-oration of its last scrap of significance.
35
States in rebellion or the death of Lincoln could prevent. All that the medium did, according to her
own account, was to exhort the President to do what he had announced he would do, to tell him
this would be a very important thing, which he knew already, to entreat him to be true to his
convictions, which was his life-long habit, and to direct him not to delay the enforcement of the
Proclamation beyond the first of the year, whereas it was absurd to suppose that he could enforce it
before the downfall of the Rebellion.16
Kase says that the lecture was “so grand and sublime” that the “little girl must have been under
deep control of the spirit of some ancient philosopher.” Mrs Maynard hints that this “ancient
philosopher” was Daniel Webster!
I do not believe that Kase was a conscious liar, but that he was a very badly mixed up old
gentleman. To remember a young woman hardly less, and very likely more than 22 years old, one
who began to deliver public lectures six years before, as a “little girl,” a “child,” is alone sufficient
to show that his memory was in a mussy condition. The date he assigns to the trance-address is
inconsistent with the claim that it brought about the document already existent in writing. His
varying but equally untrue affirmations regarding victories show how unreliable he was. And the
statement of the medium herself utterly refutes his story, except for the commonplace facts that
Nettie was there and harangued the President about his proclamations concerning which everyone
then had knowledge.
Incidentally a pretty story told by the medium Conkling to Mrs Britten must go into the ash-
barrel too. Roused probably by the interest taken in Kase’s dreamy memories imparted to the
Spiritual Scientist, one of which was that Conkling spent four Sundays with Lincoln, this medium
told Mrs Britten that his spirits “spelled out, letter by letter, the preliminary draft of that famous
document. The result of these interviews was the President’s proposition to his Cabinet to issue
such a proclamation.” Alas! Kase informs us that these four Sundays immediately preceded the
occasion when Nettie first met the President, and she tells us that she first met him in December.
But the preliminary draft had been read to the Cabinet in July, and, substantially unaltered, had
been issued in September!
The stages in the evolution of the legend, then; were somewhat as follows:
1. Nettie Colburn, in December 1862, when all the country was on tiptoe awaiting the final
Emancipation Proclamation, had the opportunity to display her mediumistic oratory before
President Lincoln. Stimulated by the stirring events happening and about to happen, she, in what
purported to be a trance state, made a very ordinary address, telling him that the freeing of four
millions of slaves would be the greatest act of his life, and exhorting him to stick to his announced
purposes against all opposition—as any country parson might have preached to him.
16
Nineteenth Century Miracles was regarded as a Spiritualist masterpiece; it was in print seven years before Mrs
Maynard printed her book, and it is impossible that she was not familiar with the Kase story. Her account of what really
happened must be regarded as a conscious and deliberate contradiction of the tale credited by the Spiritual Scientist and
by Mrs Britten. She did not expressly denounce that tale, probably out of respect for “the female St Paul of the movement”
(See Doyle’s History of Spiritualism, i. 138), whose book had given it wide circulation.
36
2. During the years that followed, Colonel Kase, so credulous that he was the delight of
tricksters, and so befuddled that the last three months of 1862 appeared to him a period of
uninterrupted Union triumph, really remembering that Nettie had told the President something
about a proclamation freeing the slaves, and that she had appeared to him to be very eloquent,
gradually and unconsciously concocted for her, in his mind, an unstable speech, and developed the
conviction that it first suggested to Lincoln the idea of issuing a proclamation of emancipation,
guileless of the fact that the date he assigned to the interview by itself defeated the claim.
3. After the incident had become thoroughly transformed in the laboratory of the Colonel’s
mind, its importance impressed him to the point of telling it in the Spiritual Scientist.
4. The tale attracting wide attention among Spiritualists, the medium Conkling became
dissatisfied with the minor part assigned to him therein, and gave out the story that his controls
dictated, “letter by letter,” the preliminary proclamation, although again dates refute the claim and,
were it true, it would completely annul Kase’s allegation that the President was indebted to Nettie
for the idea. Kase, although so familiarly associated with Conkling, was evidently ignorant of this
feature.17
5. “The narrative in substance was given to the author,” that is to Mrs Britten, by Col. Kase
himself, but as she passes on, for the most part, the Spiritual Scientist version, she probably made
no written record of the tale he told her, consequently we do not know what variations it contained.
6. Mrs Nettie Colburn Maynard, the heroine of the Kase tale, demolished it in a book of her
own, but it already had too much impetus to be thus stopped.
7. Kase told the story with many verbal and a few factual variations to Mrs Williams who, not
being addicted to research, supposed that she was the discoverer of it, and printed it anew.
8. Ignoring the medium’s own repudiation of the claim that she influenced President Lincoln to
declare emancipation, and neglecting it historical chronology not difficult of access, a professed
history insists that Nettie Colburn “determined the action of Abraham Lincoln at the supreme
moment of the Civil War,” and that “the facts are beyond dispute,”18
a professed researcher is
impressed that the story “seems authentic,” a newspaper which professes nothing but a desire to
impart news thinks the claim worth editorial attention, the legend starts again on its world-wide
travels, and the indignant ghost of Mrs Maynard protests in vain.
_______________________
17
The two stories, (1) that Nettie Colburn inspired the preliminary Proclamation, and, (2) that Conkling dictated it
verbally rest, each upon the testimony of one person alone. But the cynical Muse who presides over the growth of
legends has perpetuated the one which long ago was repudiated by its heroine, and allowed to lapse into “innocuous
desuetude” the other, which has never been refuted until the present writing.
18
Doyle bases his certainty, strange to say, not upon the Kase story, but that of Mrs Maynard, which does not in a
single sentence, or by any inference that Sherlock Holmes himself could draw from it, support the notion that Lincoln
was influenced in the least by any medium on earth to emancipate the slaves.
37
Paul Gaunt responds: So what are we to make of Dr. Walter
Prince’s conclusions and deductions regarding the
Simon P. Kase Story?
~~~~~~~~~~~
On the surface Prince has given a detailed, well researched perspective on the entire story—but
was he governed by his own personal opinion of Simon Kase? 19
In reality, Kase was only the
story teller; Dr. Prince throughout his research has put all the discrepancies, contradictions and
historical incorrectness entirely on the shoulders of Kase who had come to Washington on a
business trip! It is surprising that Prince makes no allowances that the various publishers of his
story might have added their own interpretation, or exaggerated, or perhaps wrongly formatted
Kase’s experience!
Prince in comparing the W and B version comments on Kase’s “reliability as a historian” but
Simon Kase was only relating his experience; he was a business man, not a historian.
We could counter Dr. Prince’s remark about Kase’s “reliability as a historian,” he states in note
16 for example: —
Nineteenth Century Miracles was regarded as a Spiritualist masterpiece; it was in print
seven years before Mrs Maynard printed her book, and it is impossible that she was not
familiar with the Kase story. Her account of what really happened must be regarded as a
conscious and deliberate contradiction of the tale credited by the Spiritual Scientist and
by Mrs Britten. She did not expressly denounce that tale, probably out of respect for “the
female St Paul of the movement”
Nettie Maynard states in her Author’s Preface: - 20
Some years ago, at the request of that scholarly writer, the late Prof. S. B. Brittan, I
prepared a manuscript, which he offered to edit for publication, but his death following
shortly, the MS. was lost and never recovered. The present one has been prepared at
intervals during the past three years by the aid of an amanuensis.
Samuel Byron Brittan died July 1883. If the date21
of Brittan’s death is correct. Nettie Maynard’s
original manuscript would have pre-dated the above referenced published account in Nineteenth
Century Miracles, which is an important consideration given Dr. Prince’s remarks.
19
Prince gives Simon P. Kase very little credibility in his relating of his story, we note, he regards Kase thus—“Col.
Kase was a very prominent Spiritualist of the more credulous type”—“His reports of what took place in his presence
were so far from the facts that I would not trust his memory or judgment for anything he said on the subject of Lincoln
and mediums, because I would expect that any interest which the President showed in the way of trying out mediums
would be exaggerated and warped out of semblance to the reality”—“I do not believe that Kase was a conscious liar,
but that he was a very badly mixed up old gentleman”, etc.

Was Abraham Lincoln a Spiritualist? Rufus C. Hartranft, Philadelphia 1891 pages 3-4.
38
At this point, I will focus only on the role of the medium J. B. Conklin: -22
On continuously reading the Prince report, it appeared to me, that there are probably two stories
here that have become confused and mixed up and are being presented as one event; or the dates
used by Prince are erroneous. We have seen this all too clearly in the Fox story,23
how facts and
dates become interchanged, exaggerated, and distorted.
As we note in the Prince paper, there is contradiction of the facts brought forward by S.P. Kase and
which Prince presents these in the two versions—W and B (Williams & Britten). Dr. Prince tends
to put his narrative into a time frame to emphasize his point e.g., to show contradictions in the
Kase story.
Dr. Prince firstly claimed that “the preservation of this story is due to Mrs M. E. Williams…” We
come against the problem of not knowing the actual date of the 1st
edition of Mrs Williams’
pamphlet—Abraham Lincoln Facts Indisputable. Prince references the 4th
edition but does not
give a date. However, the first teller of the Kase story is of dubious character. 24
This version of
the story he calls “W-version”:
Below are Dr. Prince’s points of reference regarding the medium Conklin.
Dr. Prince’s “W—version”:
…Col. Kase obeyed a voice which told him, as he was walking on a street in
Washington, to enter the house of a medium named Conkling, who at once engaged
him to carry a letter written by himself (Conkling) to the President. Conkling, however,
accompanied Kase, but remained in an adjoining room while the latter, equally a
stranger to Lincoln, presented the letter which stated that its writer had been sent “by
spiritual influences to confer with you regarding the interests of the nation.” Lincoln
consented to see Conkling and did so the following Sunday.
Dr. Prince’s “B—version”:
Col. Kase told the story to Mrs Emma Hardinge Britten, who embalmed it in her
Nineteenth Century Miracles (1884, pp. 484-7) published in 1884. This we will call
the B-version. Moreover, as Mrs Britten informs us, the tale had been told by him still

22
This is the correct spelling for the medium J. B. Conklin, as previously pointed out. Dr. Price incorrectly spells his
name as Conkling. It should be noted that the quotes in the B Version, of the Spiritual Scientist also spell his name
incorrectly as Conkling.

earlier, and printed in a Spiritualist paper called the Spiritual Scientist, and the B-
version includes extracts from that organ.
In referring again to Conklin, Prince states only:—
In each version Kase purports to give a copy of the letter; the two are not verbally
identical, although essentially so.
In the B-version, we find also: -
Incidentally a pretty story told by the medium Conkling to Mrs Britten must go into
the ash-barrel too. Roused probably by the interest taken in Kase’s dreamy memories
imparted to the Spiritual Scientist, one of which was that Conkling spent four Sundays
with Lincoln, this medium told Mrs Britten that his spirits “spelled out, letter by letter,
the preliminary draft of that famous document. The result of these interviews was the
President’s proposition to his Cabinet to issue such a proclamation.” Alas! Kase
informs us that these four Sundays immediately preceded the occasion when Nettie
first met the President, and she tells us that she first met him in December. But the
preliminary draft had been read to the Cabinet in July, and, substantially unaltered, had
been issued in September!
This gives us a time line on Dr. Prince’s research—Kase, gave his experiences to Mr. E. Gerry
Brown, editor of an American weekly Journal The Spiritual Scientist, published in Boston, and
founded in 1874.25
Mr. Brown would have published the Kase article some time between, 1874
and 1878, making this the earliest known version at the time of the Prince investigation. Next was
Emma Hardinge Britten, 1884,26
followed by Mrs. Williams. It may seem with the little
information Prince provides, that he probably did not in fact see the Spiritual Scientist article and
relies solely on Mrs. Britten’s narrative.
The final reference to the medium Conklin is to be found in his conclusion:—
The stages in the evolution of the legend, then; were somewhat as follows:
4. The tale attracting wide attention among Spiritualists, the medium Conkling became
dissatisfied with the minor part assigned to him therein, and gave out the story that his
controls dictated, “letter by letter,” the preliminary proclamation, although again dates
refute the claim and, were it true, it would completely annul Kase’s allegation that the
President was indebted to Nettie for the idea. Kase, although so familiarly associated
with Conkling, was evidently ignorant of this feature.27

Note by Dr. Prince: - The two stories, (1) that Nettie Colburn inspired the preliminary Proclamation, and, (2) that
Conklin dictated it verbally rest, each upon the testimony of one person alone. But the cynical Muse who presides
40
Little is generally recorded about Conklin; incidentally he was the first medium that Emma
Hardinge sat with in 1855. The first niggling thought I had when reading the Prince paper was
that Conklin lived in New York,28
not Washington. Presumably Conklin was working away
from home or just renting a room for what ever reason in Washington, which happened to be
the same room that Kase had occupied in 1850?
Looking further a field we find that Conklin did have other reported dealings with Abraham
Lincoln, however this was before the alleged meeting in Washington as recorded by Kase.
Dr. Prince makes no mention of relevant material that would have been available to him.
Below are some references regarding Conklin and Lincoln: —
In Emma Hardinge Britten’s statement29
dated Tuesday 2nd
February, 1869 given before
London Dialectical Society, she refers to a Conklin séance in Washington which she claims
Lincoln was present: —30
Any strong emotion, Mrs. Hardinge considered, was also detrimental to the exercise
of spiritual power. Mr. Conklin, of whom she had previously spoken, was invited to
attend a number of séances at Washington with some five or six gentlemen, who
were evidently desirous not to be known. The manifestations were very marked and
decisive, until Mr. Conklin discovered that one of the gentlemen present was no other
than President Lincoln; when his anxiety and surprise became so great as entirely to
stop the manifestations, which were not again renewed till a mutual explanation had
restored him to his normal state of mind. Thus, it would seem, that any very strong
emotion had also the effect of rendering the magnetism positive, and neutralising the
action of the spirits.
Later, in Modern American Spiritualism,31
Hardinge gives another account of Conklin—Lincoln:
—
Immediately after the election of the late lamented President Lincoln,32
an article
appeared in the Cleveland Plaindealer which the timid feared, and the antagonistic
over the growth of legends has perpetuated the one which long ago was repudiated by its heroine, and allowed to
lapse into “innocuous desuetude” the other, which has never been refuted until the present writing.
28
I have taken this assumption because every reference from the early 1850s until his death in 1870c all refers to
him as residing at New York with his wife and children.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from
March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.

hoped, would greatly prejudice the cause of the popular Republican leader, by
associating his name with Spiritualism.
In the expectation that he would give a public denial to what some interested
parties were pleased to consider “a most injurious statement,” the article in question
was submitted to the President, who quietly glanced over it, and in answer to the
earnest request that he would furnish a contradiction to the papers, replied: “The
only falsehood in the statement is that the half of it has not been told. This article
does not begin to tell the wonderful things I have witnessed.” The anti-spiritual
friends of President Lincoln were henceforth silent on such subjects; but rumor was
less obliging and constantly circulated reports of the séances in which the noble and
greatly harassed martyr communed with the spirits of wise and perfected men,
through whose prescient power and far-seeing judgment, counsels were poured into
his ear, which bore mighty and fateful fruit. A gentleman lately resident in
Washington and only known by his most intimate friends as a strong physical
medium, became familiarly acquainted with the contents of many an eventful state
paper before it ever saw official light—aye, even whilst it was being issued
from the spiritual press over the telegraphic wires which run between the
mortal and immortal worlds. Doubtless the human “wire-pullers,” who
surround the seats of office and plant their batteries of influence so as to make
the nation’s welfare bear primarily on their own, imagine they have exerted an
immense power in the great ultimates of national destiny, but they little deem
that there are also invisible machinists at work inclosing themselves no less
than the country in a network of hidden causes, whose woof is spun by the
hands of mightier statesmen than earth, and rulers whose viewless batteries of
power galvanize even the very stones beneath men's feet into preachers of their
resistless purposes.
The paragraph in the Cleveland Plaindealer above referred to, is as follows:
“THE PRESIDENT ELECT A SPIRITUALIST”
“It so happened that Conklin, the test medium from New York, was in
Cleveland on the day when President Lincoln arrived on his way to
Washington. Being a Republican himself, and not wishing to run an opposition
to the distinguished visitant, he broke up his own levees at the Johnson to
attend that of President Lincoln at the Weddell. The moment he set eyes on Mr.
Lincoln, he recognized in him a very peculiar individual who had formerly
been a frequent visitor at his room in New York, but whose name he had never
been made acquainted with. He used to come alone, sit silently, question
mentally, and depart as he came, unnoticed. On one occasion he got a
remarkable test, which was published in the Spiritualist at the time, in New
York. On referring to a file of that paper, Mr. Conklin furnished us with the
narrative, which ran as follows:
42
“ ‘A GOOD TEST
“ ‘A gentleman who has often visited Mr. Conklin, called upon him on the
evening of March 23, for the usual purpose of communicating with his spirit
friends.
“ ‘After asking some twenty or more mental questions, which he briefly
stated were answered correctly, he put the following, question: ‘Can you
inform me of Mr. K.’s condition?’
The answer, written through Conklin’s hand, was: ‘Yes; he is present now.’
Q. When did he die? A. Yesterday morning; he is happy, but cannot
communicate. The gentleman departed from his generally taciturn conduct to
say this was a very remarkable case, for the friend he had inquired for and
whom that communication stated to be present, he had left three days
previously in Wisconsin, twelve hundred miles distant, alive, and though
indisposed, pronounced by his physician to be fast recovering from a long
illness. At Mr. Conklin’s solicitation he promised to inform him if the
communication should prove correct. In accordance with his word, the stranger
did call on Conklin the next morning and informed him that he had just
received a telegraphic dispatch from a brother-in-law of Mr. K.’s, announcing
his death on the previous morning, and at the hour stated by the spirit. Mr.
Conklin says that Mr. Lincoln is the identical gentleman referred to in the
Spiritualist; that he remembers him from the peculiarity of his appearance,
from his frequent calls, and as the recipient of this particular test.’ ”
The evidence that Conklin had some early
involvement with Lincoln is open to more
research.
We know that on one occasion Conklin
certainly sent President Lincoln a written
communication from the spirit of one of
Lincoln’s friends Edward D. Baker.33
These two letters are a part of eight letters sent to
President Lincoln, from J. B. Conklin: Note that
they are recorded as I. B. Conklin, rather than the
correct initials J. B.

44
In Conclusion at the present time: -
1) Conklin’s letter content and later meeting/s, etc:—
W version: —“by spiritual influences to confer with you regarding the interests of the nation.”
The President met Conklin the following Sunday—Conklin was not mentioned again.
B version:—“I have been sent from the city of New York by Spiritual influence pertaining to the
interest of the nation. I can’t return until I see you. Appoint the time. Yours, etc., “ ‘(Signed) J.
B. CONKLIN.’ ” Re meeting: — “President Lincoln seemed very much interested and said: ‘Tell
Mr. Conklin that I will see him on Sunday, between 9 and 10 a.m.’ ‘Oh, no,’ was my reply;
‘write him a letter.’ This is the last we hear of Conklin—“we returned to our respective
lodgings.” (E.H. Britten)
Also in the B Version we have the Spiritual Scientist bold claim:—“For four succeeding
Sundays Mr. Conkling was a guest at the Presidential mansion.”
The editor (1874-1878) of the Spiritual Scientist E. Gerry Brown, continues:—“Mr. Conkling
has himself alleged to the author, that the Spirits not only urged the subject of the
emancipation proclamation, but that they, in the name of the Independence Fathers,
spelled out, letter by letter, the preliminary draft of that famous document.”
As at present we do not know what date this article was published, not having read the
original text by Brown it is difficult to comment, except to say that Brown must have
obtained this alleged story from Conklin some years prior to the Spiritual Scientist as J.B.
Conklin died 1870c.36
In the B Version E.H. Britten dates the Kase visit as 1862, but no indication
of the month, the Spiritual Scientist quoted in her narrative is not dated by the editor.
2) When President Lincoln read the letter given to him by Kase, did he immediately consent to see
Conklin, because he already knew the medium J. B. Conklin? Because, he had attended séances:
—“who [Lincoln] had formerly been a frequent visitor at his room in New York…” as
reported by Cleveland Plaindealer. The report certainly if correct, furnished the President with
excellent evidence of Conklin’s ability.
There is also Emma Hardinge Britten’s report to the London Dialectical Society:—“The
manifestations were very marked and decisive, until Mr. Conklin discovered that one of the
gentlemen present was no other than President Lincoln…”
3) Marc Demarest’s Emma Hardinge Britten website www.ehbritten.org is planning to digitalise the
Spiritual Scientist. This may give us a fuller account of their report, which was quoted by EHB
(B Version). Periodicals (founded and edited by EHB) already available are, Western Star, The
Unseen Universe and The Two Worlds see: — http://ehbritten.org/bibliography.html

An undated obituary appears in The Year-Book of Spiritualism for 1871 by / edited, Hudson Tuttle and J.M.
Peebles William White and Company, Boston and James Burns London, 1871 page 221. The book it appears was
completed by October 1870 from its various contributors, then published in 1871
45
4) It may be that the medium Conklin does not fully belong in the Kase narrative in the dates
presented by Dr. Prince!
5) Dr. Prince places much of his conclusions on the date (in general) that Kase, Nettie and
Conklin came into contact with President Lincoln, he states this was August / December 1862,
but on 22nd
July 1862—Abraham Lincoln read to his Cabinet the draft of a preliminary
proclamation of emancipation.
6) Dr. Prince had consulted two maybe three accounts of Simon Kase’s story, as given by
Williams, Britten and the Spiritual Scientist. There is little information as to the correct dating of
all these associated events. As I have already mentioned Nettie’s MS was lost,37
so while on her
death bed she had to now dictate the entire book, at this point she was unable to write. , this was
over a three year period. In her Authors Preface page 1, she states:—There may be some
inaccuracy in dates, as the more prominent events occurred many years ago; but the
circumstances as stated are correctly recorded. It should be noted that Nettie Maynard does not
mention the medium Conklin in her book, and only briefly Kase as being present. It is mentioned
in the Publisher’s Preface pages XVi, and only mentioned once by Colburn on page 90 (first
edition).
7) Prince himself has made a number of date errors in his paper, one error is to record the
proclamation date incorrectly in one part of his paper. Some of his dates referring to Kase etc., he
does not reference, so one wonders to its origin; as the whole story depends on correct dating! Dr.
Price appears not to have furthered his research and had accepted that the few references he had to
hand finalised the story. The arrival of Simon Kase, the Conklin letter, and the young entranced
medium, who spoke to the President all depend on the dates that they allegedly took place! If
reference could be found that all this allegedly took place a year earlier, this would certainly add a
new perspective to the entire Simon Kase story.

In Memoriam
MRS. MARGARET WILKINSON,
MANCHESTER
AS INTIMATED last week, there passed to spirit-
life on the 25th ulto.41
Mrs. Margaret Wilkinson,
the only surviving sister of Mrs. Emma Hardinge
Britten. The interment of the physical casket took
place at the Harpurhey Cemetery, Manchester, on
Wednesday of last week, the body being placed in
the grave occupied by her husband, her mother
(Mrs. Floyd), her sister (Mrs. Britten) and her
husband (Dr. Britten). A party of relatives and
friends, including Mr. A. W. Orr, assembled at the
late residence of the departed one, when a brief and
affecting service was conducted by Mr. J. J. Morse,
who had been a personal friend of the family since
1869. The same gentleman conducted the committal service at the graveside, at which a
considerable concourse of friends and others was present.
Mrs. Wilkinson was born in Bristol, but came to Manchester when only four years of age, and
was brought up by a maternal aunt; thus she was almost a citizeness of Manchester. In early life
she was associated with the Unitarian body, and for some years was an active worker in the
school of that denomination in Lower Mosley-street in this city. She accompanied the scholars to
Peel Park upon the occasion of the visit of Queen Victoria and the Duke of Wellington. At one
time she was a member of the Cross-street Chapel, being well acquainted with the Rev. Wm.

Glaskell and his talented wife, also with many prominent families whose names in most
instances are only memories to-day. She was married in Manchester in 1857 to Mr. G. R.
Wilkinson, and later both accompanied Mrs. Britten-then Mrs. Hardinge-to New York, where
she first became acquainted with Spiritualism. While in America she met the Fox sisters, J. V.
Mansfield, Ada Foye, the Koons brothers, C. H. Foster, and others of the noted mediums of the
early days; also Luther Colby (Editor of The Banner of Light), Epes Sargent, Dr. J. R.
Newton (the remarkable spiritual healer), and scores of other eminent workers of former days.
Her active business career was closed by her appointment as Foreign Librarian at the Library in
St. Ann-street, under the Manchester Corporation. Mrs. Wilkinson's last illness was only of eight
days’ duration, and was not attended with any physical suffering. She was an ardent Spiritualist,
always indefatigable in her exertions towards any bazaar or other undertaking for the interest of
the Cause for which her aid was desired. Her departure severs another link in the chain of the
early pioneer workers, as by her transition the family of Mrs. Britten becomes mortally extinct.
Thus our old workers pass from view, but the memory of their good deeds and faithful services
will never be forgotten.

The Photograph:—is an impressionist sketch of “ALBERT” by Dolores Smith.
Asked for his views concerning it, “Albert” said: “It is not very flattering. My
hair is not quite so bad at the back! But there is a likeness, and I dare say you
could recognise me from it.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
As this is the first interview “for publication” ever given by “Albert,” the distinguished con-
trol of Mrs. Helen Duncan, some importance may attach to—it and it will probably serve a
useful purpose to outline, briefly, the unusual circumstances attending its delivery.
The experiences of more than a dozen materialisation séances with Mrs. Duncan had
impressed me with the fact that an interview with “Albert,” the lending personality in those
demonstrations, would be not only desirable from the point of view of a general interest, but
might probably be productive of some important information. Accordingly I mentioned the
matter casually, and in the course of conversation, to Mrs. Duncan. She, quite as casually, replied
that she was “willing to do anything.” The matter dropped then: until five days afterwards at the
close of one of her seances at Manchester, when I mentioned to a group of sitters engaged in
conversation with Mrs. Duncan that, with her permission, I should like to conduct an experiment
in slate-writing. Under an adjacent card-table I placed a slate and crayon, and taking Mrs.
Duncan's right hand, placed it under the slate, so that the latter was supported against the under-
surface of the table. The left hand and arm of the medium lay on the upper surface of the table.
Mrs. Duncan was apparently under the impression that I was seeking enlightenment on some
personal difficulty, for she remarked, “I am tired to-night. Mind, I will only ‘do’ one question.”
She engaged in conversation with me while the sound of the crayon was heard tracing a reply
to my “question”—simply a formal request for the arrangement of this interview. In about one
minute’s time three distinct raps were given as a signal that the experiment was completed, and I
took the slate out of Mrs. Duncan’s hand as she brought it from under the table.
On the upper surface, in small though perfectly legible characters, was written “Albert’s”
reply—“I will do anything to oblige. Yes. Albert.” The reply was most pertinent, and certainly
answered my “question.”
To have accomplished this frauduently, Mrs. Duncan would need to have been a remarkably
clever woman. She would need to have singled out of innumerable conversations a single phrase
uttered with no particular emphasis. Her sleight-of-hand, in the actual process of the slate-
writing, must also have been most perfect—more perfect, certainly, than that of any conjuror at
present “on the boards.”
That is, briefly, the story of how this interview came about.
It took place at a private residence in Manchester on Sept. 16th, five persons in all attending.
The room was illuminated by a bright ruby light and a curtain arranged against one corner of the
wall served the purpose of a cabinet. Mrs. Duncan retired into this, and in a minute or two
“Albert’s” clear, cultured voice was heard complaining at the smallness of his apartment. He was
also dissatisfied with the strength of the light, which was immediately lowered to his taste, but
50
there was still sufficient illumination to enable the writer to make notes, and every one of the
other sitters to catch occasional glimpses of the figure of the medium.
“ALBERT” APPEARS
Then “Albert” came into view—his tall form, clothed in ectoplasm, being clearly outlined
against the dark curtain of the cabinet. He remained in this condition for quite twenty minutes—
except when on two occasions, while I was addressing him, the curtain was drawn back and
shielded him from our view; but in neither case did his temporary disappearance occupy more
than the space of forty seconds.
“When were you first brought into contact with the medium, and what attracted you?” was the
first question submitted him. His voice, coming from the head of the form—personally, I was
unable to distinguish the features—was both clear and pronounced.
“It is a most difficult question to answer briefly, “he said.” When I had resided on this side a
number of years, I was approached by a person interested in establishing communication with
earth, and I was asked whether I would like to participate in a series of experiments. The man
who addressed me was called Marklew Douglas. ‘You seem to be very clever in making
things,’ he said. ‘Probably you would be useful,’ I was shown the process of building
materialised spirit forms so that they become visible to people in the material world. Douglas
suggested that I might possibly have the gift of moulding the substance—which I call
psychoplasm—into recognisable forms, and at his invitation I consented to conduct some
experiments.
“I made many attempts, with varying success. Sometimes I was more successful than at
others, but I persevered with the work. Later I discovered that I was not to make the
semblance of a human form at all. I had only to clothe the thoughts of the people who
presented themselves for materialisation. My task was simply to clothe the thought-form with
psychoplasm so that it should become, for a short period, tangible and visible and ‘real’ to
your senses.
“It was this work which brought me into contact with Mrs. Duncan. For her I have the
highest regard; and I am grateful to the Higher Powers that this channel has been opened out
to me, so that I can occasionally render strength and comfort to those who suffer the
temporary loss of loved companions.”
“You are the leader, I understand, of a band of spirits who work with the medium?”
“You are under a great misapprehension if you imagine that I, alone, am responsible for
the phenomena that occur. We have our chemists here, just as you have on your side, and
they who are associated with this work all have their special and particular functions.”
“Can you give me some insight as to the methods of operation which you employ?”
51
“ALBERT,”THE HYPNOTIST
“During a seance Mrs. Duncan is under the domination of my will. I simply put her to
sleep in the same way as any hypnotist would do. In that sense, at least, you may say that she
is throughout the seance in the hypnotic condition. When I wish her to do anything, I suggest
it. Suggestion is at the root of it all. You might also say that I take control her brain and
body.
“There are occasions, fortunately rare, when I am called away during a seance to attend to
other important duties. I have no doubt that, in such cases, a stronger personality in the flesh
might exercise a measure of influence over Mrs. Duncan, and she would act on his
suggestions. Under such influence, for example, she might rise and impersonate a so-called
spirit. . But my contact with her would not be completely broken, and I should immediately
return and explain what had happened. In such circumstances you would recognise how
valuable would be the services of a band of spirits such as are associated with this medium.
In fact, there are always several in attendance; otherwise we should not hold a seance at all.”
“Is your work with Mrs. Duncan confined to the period of the seance, or are there any
preparations made beforehand?”
“Yes, preparations have to be made. The medium feels me working on her psychic
constitution sometimes several hours before the start of the sitting. Frequently the effect is an
agitation of the mind, and she may even become pessimistic as to the success of a seance.
“I have been looking at you while standing here, and I should just like to say how you
appear from my point of view. You seem to be very shadowy and dark. You appear the mere
figments of what you feel you are. It is often very strange for those who are coming in
contact with earth, for the first time since their passing, to note the physical appearance of
loved ones left behind. They think that they are alive, and that it is you who are dead.”
“It is, doubtless, a very difficult experience to attempt to materialise for the first time?
“So much depends upon the sitter. The successful sitter is the one who maintains a
balanced and open mind. The emotional sitter is at a disadvantage. Supposing you and I were
old friends, and something happened which took you away to a foreign country…. We do not
hear from one another…. Yeas later I meet you suddenly in the same house. What would
happen? Well, we should both be overcome! So when you go to a seance, and I in spirit
attempt to materialise for the first time, there naturally arises great emotion. If the sitter
keeps his mind in an even state, and is determined not to be excited, the spirit, manifesting as
it does in a condition abnormal to it, is all the more likely to remain calm and self-possessed.
In such circumstances there is certainly more likelihood of evidence of identity being
obtained.”
“ALBERT” AND CECIL HUSK
“I should like to ask if you, ‘Albert,’ have met many of the controls of the great physical
mediums of the past: Have you met ‘John King,’ Abdula,’ or ‘Ernest,’ for instance?”
52
“No, I have not had the privilege of meeting any of those you mention. But you may be
interested to know that I have met one distinguished in your annals—and he has rendered
considerable service in advancing my own work. I have met Cecil Husk, whom you will
recognise as one who, when on earth, was a materialising medium of great note. Husk’s
experience has been invaluable to me, in showing me exactly the type of evidence which is
most needed on your side.
“He has particularly interested himself in the development of one branch of our work, and
that is the production of what are called ‘spirit lights.’ Of late, you know, we have
concentrated on the production of spirit faces. Our present object is to produce both face and
light together so that a materialised form may hold the light close to its features, and thus
assist its recognition. It is simply a matter of development. We have, of course, to move
rather cautiously, lest we overtax the psychic powers of the medium, and she suffers a
relapse. We are very human like you, even though we are spirits!”
“In America materialisations are said to be produced more easily than in this country, and
that has been put down to the different atmospheres. Have you, ‘Albert.’ in your experiments
made any observations as to the effect of weather conditions on materialisation phenomena?”
“Generally speaking, a dry and frosty night is the most helpful.”
“What would you estimate as the weight of the average materialised form produced
through Mrs. Duncan's mediumship?”
“That is an interesting aspect. A spirit who on your side lead but a frail figure would not
weigh more than four or five pounds when materialised! Many of the forms built would
probably weigh about eight or nine pounds. There are instances—in the case of abnormally
developed persons—where the forms weighed as many as twenty-six or thirty pounds. But
these are exceptions. With Mrs. Duncan we could draw about twenty-six to thirty pounds of
substance, but she could not bear the withdrawal of more than that.”
THE PART THE SITTERS PLAY
“What have you to say in regard to the theory that the sitters contribute some psychic
power during a séance?”
“I agree with it wholeheartedly. I might illustrate by referring to the contributions of those
now assembled. Mrs. B—seems to be a frail person, and it would superficial appear as
though she could contribute nothing of any value. But she has a certain amount of lime in the
system, upon which we can draw. We might extract as much as an ounce. After a seance she
will feel a reaction. It would locate itself in the soreness of the bones all over the body, and
general physical exhaustion. Mr. B—would feel the after-effect in the region of the lungs, his
particular contribution being to the breathing of the materialised forms. You would feel the
reaction in exhaustion of the brain.
53
“In a gathering such as a seance several people may contribute to the success, each in his own
special way. From the medium I take the psychoplasm—a tissue like substance—which makes
the figures visible. But quite as much depends on the sitters who contribute psychic force, and
incidentally this largely accounts for the quick likes and dislikes characteristic of the medium.
Certain types of people ‘blend’ with Mrs. Duncan because they supply the psychic power she
needs. Others, again, contribute little or nothing, and the medium is not ‘drawn’ to them. Of
course she does not always understand this herself, and is frequently nonplussed by her own
reaction or attitude in regard to certain persons, against whom she knows she has no reason for
grievance, but whose mere presence she finds it difficult to tolerate.”
“What form of preparation do you suggest to your sitters prior to attending a materialisation
seance?”
“There are no preparations that I can suggest. I have been in contact with a great number of
people who cherish the idea of taking a bath before a seance, adorning themselves in white
linen, etc. What does it matter what clothes you wear, or whether you have had a dozen baths?
You always appear to us as you ARE—not as you pretend, or would like yourself to be. Your
exterior does not matter. What is needed is a clean and balanced mind.”
“Do you, or any of the other members of your band, derive personal benefit from your work
in this channel?”
“I feel very happy in my work, especially when I can bring comfort to those who suffer and
are almost without hope. My work means everything to me. One day, when the medium comes
to our side of life, I will be waiting to meet her, and together we may go forward to a higher
plane. My sitters often say how grateful they are for experiences which are given them. I want
no thanks! It is sufficient, to know that some good has been accomplished, and in that
knowledge I derive great benefit and, needless to say, much happiness.”
“It is almost impossible to describe this realistic conversation as it appeared to those who
were present.
“Albert” was on view most of the time, but towards the end he disappeared in person,
leaving us what he called his “voice-box”—a considerable affair, about five feet high, and
having a loud speaker appearance at the top. From this his voice emerged.
He dramatically illustrated several points in his conversation by actual demonstration then
and there, as, for instance, when he wished to show what would happen if, in his absence, Mrs.
Duncan came under the influence of one of her sitters: the curtain closed on the voice-box, but
opened quickly afterwards to reveal a full-form figure of considerable proportions standing in
front of the cabinet. Slowly the figure turned round until its “face” came in view. It was the
form of Mrs. Duncan clothed in ectoplasm.
54
TEN-YARDS YARDS OF ECTOPLASM!
Still more remarkable were the closing demonstrations Mrs. Duncan was influenced to walk
out of the cabinet on three occasions, and each time a long trail of ectoplasm was visible to our
sight.
On the final occasion no fewer than ten yards (measured) of this material stretched along
the floor, and appeared to emanate from her mouth and nostrils. It flickered and curled as a
living substance, and reminded one of the raiments spoken of in the account of the historic
seance held on the Mount of Transfiguration—as “white as snow.”
The medium retraced her steps to the cabinet, the ectoplasmic ribbon, in some places a yard
wide, extending behind her. Suddenly it whisked along the floor. Part of it seemed to disappear
into the cabinet, part apparently vanished where it lay.
In the space of half-a-minute Mrs. Duncan, breathing heavily, walked, out of the recess and
was placed in an adjacent chair. She was enveloped in a cold perspiration. The pupils of her
eyes were turned completely upwards. Then, as we made the measurements recorded above,
she came slowly to herself.
So ended a most magnificent experience, and surely one of the most dramatic interviews
any journalist has ever had.
