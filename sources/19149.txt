Kristen has been working on getting dr.
Steven Greer on leak project and is

being told the truth it&#39;s quite
incredible especially when it comes to
the et disclosure and I&#39;ve done
interviews with people all over the
world that have made some incredible
claims and many of the people that I&#39;ve

presentation
and keeping the change paid recharger
calm kobe 15 15% off I have never seen a
full interview with dr. Steven Greer
before I&#39;ve seen bits and pieces and
I&#39;ve heard about him and if anybody&#39;s
heard of UFOs and ETS they&#39;ve heard of
dr. Steven Greer because he&#39;s the PI one
of the pioneers in modern UFO gee I
guess that&#39;s kind of an oxymoron but
he&#39;s definitely one of the frontrunners
of modern you apology not just stuff
that happened 80 years ago so when dr.
Steven Greer is describing these
protocols on how to actually make
contact with extraterrestrial entities
and beans of very high consciousness and
you watch his body language and you
listen to the tonality and you listen to
what he says and the words that he uses
in the context that he uses them in and
if you&#39;re good at reading people you can
tell he&#39;s telling the truth
so dr. Steven Greer in my book has just
stepped up multiple chapters very
wonderful presentation
it&#39;s called Close Encounters of the
fifth kind now I wanted to show you some
of the notes that I took from the
documentary Close Encounters of the
fifth kind by dr. Steven Greer with the
serious disclosure are these ce-5
protocols
now the ce-5 protocols are actually step
by step ways to make contact with
extraterrestrials and dr. Steven Greer
was pointing out how this actually upset
the certain intelligence communities
because they don&#39;t want you to have
contact with these higher beings they
want you to believe that anything
outside of the US or anything outside of
the world is a threat that&#39;s what they
want you to think so they can make more
money build more bombs create more
military complexes and enjoy the lavish
lifestyles so when they don&#39;t have that
control mechanism over the people that
fear-based control mechanism and people
start making contact with
extraterrestrials realizing that these
beings are far superior in technology
and consciousness right now
and they&#39;re friendly one of the things
that he brought up was in the in the
presentation if beans are coming to
visit us that are tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands millions of years
ahead of us
technologically and consciously they
could utterly destroy the planet if they
wanted to they could wipe it off the
face of the year they could wipe it off
the face of the universe
nananananana like red dust make it
disappear but they don&#39;t why I&#39;m
thinking of the Book of Enoch also I&#39;ve
been reading bits and pieces I&#39;ve been
going through multiple podcasts
describing different books of Enoch I&#39;m
in - Enoch right now which is the
Slavonic version of Enoch and it&#39;s a
wonderful read and it describes how
beans came from up there to not only
control some of the beans down here but
almost like there&#39;s the strings up there
you&#39;re the puppet master up there and
then you&#39;re you&#39;re playing with yourself
down here from up there and you&#39;re
forgetting about it at the same time to
make it an experience because maybe
you&#39;re bored if you know everything all
the time so you want to learn it over
again
and create experiences if you know
everything then what do you have
experiences right so these
interdimensional beans and actually
there&#39;s a photograph that&#39;s another
thing I got to say about this series Wow
or not the series with the documentary
the photographs and the video evidence
that they present is excellent and the
majority of the photographic and film
evidence that they share is during these
ce-5 protocols where there&#39;s actually
groups of people calling these
extraterrestrials and asking for them to
make themselves known and they do and
vary in various shapes and sizes and
colors you can clearly tell they&#39;re
anomalies but there&#39;s this one image in
particular towards the end of the
documentary showing this being this
light beam that has almost like a
triangular head and it is shown over
this one gentleman that has had hearing
problems almost his entire life
and he&#39;s an older gentleman older than
me anyway and he actually doesn&#39;t have
hearing issues anymore
he can hear great after that event that
was experienced with other people when
they were doing one of these ce-5
protocols and I&#39;m sure that stands for
Close Encounters the fifth kind were
instead of just saying wow that&#39;s an
incredible vessel who&#39;s piloting the
vessel how do we make contact with them
and that&#39;s another interesting thing
that was just a very wonderful
fascinating topic that was described
during this documentary of consciousness
and how it works at a ethereal level and
how it&#39;s all connected and how there&#39;s
actually tests and studies and machines
that show your thought can influence the
balance of a duality system that
generates fifty fifty zeros and ones if
you&#39;re focusing on a one and you do it
long enough that machine will start
producing ones just based upon your
thought you&#39;re not typing in any
messages you&#39;re not doing anything
physical except for that thinking that
thought which influences the machine you
have to make contact with these beings
with these incredible entities with
laser precision with your mind and
that&#39;s one of the things dr. Berger
talks about also is vectoring these
craft and these ETS and and making
contact with them showing them where
you&#39;re at asking them if they would make
them so asking them to make themselves
known you have to be a pure intent you
have to you can&#39;t have you can&#39;t be
bringing them in for the wrong reasons
because they&#39;re not gonna listen to you
because they know your intent they fill
it it&#39;s a telepathic level so when you
make contact with one of these beings or
with a group of these beings and ask
them to come pay a visit then you have
to give them directions so you have to
have incredible imagination and focus
now focusing your intent on showing them
how to get to where you&#39;re located so if
you&#39;re in southern Colorado well then
you could imagine the wonderful city of
Durango and then you could start looking
at it at a larger scale
envisioning yourself floating outside or
being on a on a balloon that&#39;s taking
you out and then it starts going faster
and faster and faster and you can see
where you are and you&#39;re sending this
back to those that you want to come say
hello and then I also think to myself
these beans are so far advanced why in
the world are they going to come say hi
to us
I mean what&#39;s what&#39;s the point of that
well there could be a much deeper
connection our DNA could have a
connection to some of these beans some
of these beans could be us in the future
they could be our family our star family
they could be Stewart&#39;s of the universe
like if you saw let&#39;s say you found you
know you&#39;re out riding your bicycle and
you see this dog that looks curious
happy it&#39;s like yeah just watch to go
pet it it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere
you&#39;re like wait a second where you&#39;re
lost can I help you so you get out you
know you get off your bike and you go to
pet the dog and he&#39;s happy to see he&#39;s
wagging his tail super happy and you&#39;re
petting him and then you realize this
thing wants to make a connection with
you it&#39;s like hey and what it it&#39;s
trying to it&#39;s trying to you know
communicate with you and understand you
and and gather a purpose and you and and
then it&#39;s like I need to get home to I
got lost so you help it find its way
back and then you you want to help it
that&#39;s most people have in their in
their gut in their heart the desire to
help others especially if they see
somebody needs help most people so and
that&#39;s with our limited facilities
physically that it&#39;s like a a receiver I
was thinking about this the other day
the universe as consciousness can be
anything at any time or everything at
once so now if you have a receiver or a
box that is a tuner that only picks up
specific frequencies because of its
manufacturing
the way that it was made it is now
limited but once that tuner disappears
now everything is flowing as it you know
it&#39;s flowing without stopping and then
changing channels getting bits and
pieces and it all has its purpose so
that that radio is wonderful because it
can tune in to specific frequencies even
though it is limited you have a new
opportunity to listen to something in
limited fashion which in a sense is
adding to the infinite bliss of life
consciousness rebirth and endurance so
when you when you make contact with
these beams like you see right here I&#39;ve
got this here&#39;s the brain your brains
and antenna your brains and antennae and
you&#39;re making contact with an entity or
multiple entities or beings somewhere
else in the universe and that somewhere
else in the universe is a concept of
imagination as well
because everything is connected at some
level we&#39;re all drops in the ocean right
now we&#39;re experiencing this individually
but then we can be put back into the
ocean at one point and then we&#39;ll be
flowing with the ocean not dropping from
a cloud to the ocean as a single
raindrop metaphorically speaking so the
the interdimensional beings and there&#39;s
this about one image that I told you
about where that wonderful loving being
actually healed that person&#39;s hearing
they got an image of that and it was
incredible I&#39;ve talked to people who
have had experiences with ETS that
aren&#39;t happy though which are very like
they almost start tearing up when they
talk about they get really nervous and
they&#39;ve described these beans coming in
and out of dimensions as well like this
is now whether or not those beans and
that is a technology that&#39;s used by dark
factions within the world human factions
shadow operations that&#39;s another thing
that was
discussed during this documentary and
this was they put this on the record
very high level ranking officials
describing covert operations to create
fear and instill fear in those when it
comes to ETS pretending to be
extraterrestrials with the mind control
tactics and other various means and if
they&#39;re using frequencies combined with
hallucination supplements that would
cause hallucinations or what I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t know how the protocols work but a
very very refined process with
technology that these shadow operations
use to mimic an abduction create and
instill fear in the masses so if ETS
ever do visit people have that
fear-based mindset now one thing that I
am not that I do not agree with if if
somebody out there says every being in
the universe that&#39;s advanced beyond
humans are peaceful I have a tough time
believing that right now it could be the
case however I think we need to have we
still need to keep our guards in a
position where we can protect ourselves
now if there&#39;s beans that are billions
of years advanced and they already know
where we are
then there&#39;s no way we&#39;re gonna stop
them so if they wanted to do something
unless something of a higher stature was
to step in and prevent that but one
thing that he did bring up dr. Greer was
out of all these experiments that have
been done
nobody has ever been harmed so if if you
are a receiver and you&#39;re sending out a
signal of love and peace and happiness
and excitement and wanting to learn and
understand and utaite and you and you
connect to another being out there with
this
or precision of thought you ever hear
you get what you think you attract what
you think so you&#39;re sending out a
positive vibration that&#39;s connecting to
another positive entity that is then
making himself or herself or itself
known first as if you&#39;re in an area
where you&#39;re thinking very negative
thoughts and you&#39;re sending out all this
energy and these frequencies and these
vibrations are much more likely to tap
into something of a pattern in a similar
form energy wise and the further we
understand this and refine this with our
minds the more that we realize we can we
can send out energy and receive energy
the more powerful our minds become more
powerful our thoughts become then we
need to focus on as much good intention
as possible at this point okay so the
footage is amazing the connections the
contacts that do describe these these
extraterrestrials and our dimensionals
disclosures here folks disclosure has
happened they even share a document that
I need to find the document number on
this from the fbi.gov slash vault that
describes beans that come from somewhere
else
disclosed and this is 70 years ago
disclosures already happened so it
reminds me so much of the Book of Enoch
so to make contact this is what I
understood from the ce-5 protocols to
make contact you have a peaceful
intention you clear your mind as best as
possible now that&#39;s the toughest part
right especially for people like me so
focus your mind focus your intention
focus your intention and in making
contact with an extraterrestrial or an
interdimensional once you feel that you
have made that connection you asked for
it to make itself known to you to show
itself and you have to have positive
intentions and then once you do that
then you bring it in like you vector it
and you show you show it where you&#39;re at
like I was describing with these visual
forms you
as best as you can to the city so you
just show the planet in your mind then
then the state then the city and then
the the block or the town that you&#39;re in
and then show the house that you&#39;re in
and find a way to do that with your
imagination as you&#39;re sending it out to
this entity or these entities so that it
can follow that path because most likely
these beans and the craft that they use
are connected at a telepathic level it&#39;s
like a merger the first part of the
documentary describes the way that the
mind and consciousness works and shows
how it can be measured with value even
though you don&#39;t physically see it with
your eyes
it&#39;s fascinating documentary you really
want to see this it&#39;s great so thank you
for listening if you&#39;ve seen it I want
to hear what you think have an amazing
day
be the change you want to see
