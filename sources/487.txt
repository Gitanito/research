    Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Boazeo, El.
 Impresso Francmason.
 1894--1898?  Semimonthly, irregular
 Mexico, DF.  Language:  Spanish.  Editor: Jose M. Medina.
 1/1, December 1894. 2-4 pp., 1 centavo.

 Medina had broken with the established Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in Mexico (dominated by President Porfirio Díaz and recognized by the Northern Jurisdiction in the United States) and established his own Rito Mexicano Reformado in July 1893, of which this was the organ.  The rite rather surprisingly did not pattern or establish itself on the Memphis-Misraim Antient and Primitive Rite, but seems to have been Medina's own creation.  It was progressive in its viewpoint, but extremely Christian, albeit anti-Catholic.  The rite also, uniquely for the time and place, allowed women to join.  The journal was a nice mixture of local Mexican politics (religious reform) and antiquarian explorations (Masonic numbers and cyphers, "gimnosofistas," etc.) and gave considerable space to its own Constitution and other foundation documents, sections of which were occasionally bound in with the journal with their own pagination.  The name of the journal was said to be the adjectival form of the name Boaz, referring to Jesus as the descendent of Boaz, David and Solomon.

 The journal's possible importance springs from the fact that Aleister Crowley claimed Masonic initiation and elevation to the 33 degree in Mexico, supposedly in 1900, by someone named Jesus de Medina (or Medina-Sidonia), who is almost certainly the editor of the journal: most articles are signed as by "Jesus Medina."   "Don Jesus Medina, a descendant of the great duke of Armada fame, and one of the highest chiefs of Scottish Rite free-masonry. My cabbalistic knowledge being already profound by current standards, he thought me worthy of the highest initiation in his power to confer; special powers were obtained in view of my limited sojourn, and I was pushed rapidly through and admitted to the thirty-third and last degree before I left the country."
