  		              		Experience Description   

  I was eight years old.  Earlier that year, I was diagnosed with B-Cell Leukemia within my legs. Thanks to the effort and persistence of my father, who is also a physician, he kept pushing doctors for an explanation of the sudden deterioration of my health and inability to run or walk properly. My mother who is very religious and a staunch Catholic spends most of her seconds praying, even now.
  
  It was the week of Christmas Eve 2005  and I was sitting in a hospital bed with my mother in the room. Oddly, I remember seeing my father and sister walking through the door, but this never happened because they weren't ever there.  That night, I had asked my mother to pray and ask Jesus to help me. She said, 'I am always praying for you but YOU also need to pray and talk to God.' 

  Several moments later, I was thirsty. So, I ask her to get me a drink. I remember praying as an open conversation rather than a specific prayer.  I  started to convulse and was having seizure. My mother came back into the room and saw me. She immediately ran to  press the emergency button. I was flatlining during my convulsions. All the emergency doctors and surgeons on the floor came rushing in the room.  My mother had fainted. 

  At first very briefly, like a still image, I saw myself below me. I don't remember  specific details of seeing my body or the room, but what came next, I vividly remember.   I transitioned to see a white, glowing space, similar to those commercials where the entire area is near-blinding white.  However, there is no definition to the space, so it seemedlike an endless  void. I had no shadow,  body, or physical form.  I remember 'looking' around.  I felt like  I was in a jacuzzi because the light felt like heated water. It was a comforting,  peaceful, free, and euphoric  feeling despite that I had no physical form. It  was like a camera that you see in the professional NFL games, that is floating around the field and can move in any direction.  I felt amazing!
 
  Over the years, I've tried making sense of the feelings and sensations. The feelings have never faded but they are still  so difficult to explain. The sense of peace and amount of comfort I felt were the best I have ever felt in my life. Since then, I have foolishly tried to chase the rabbit and do various drugs, trying to re-create those feelings I had that night. If these feelings were experienced by the rest of humanity,  I  believe it  would surely make the world a better place by ending the hate and evilness seen around the world.
