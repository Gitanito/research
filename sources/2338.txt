The Stansted Job
The Society for Psychical Research in London has rejected criticism of its offer for sale
to its council members of surplus rare Spiritualist material given by Stansted (see
previous issues1
.) At its council meeting of 9 October, the Chair advised members to
press on with this approach. There was no feeling that the material in question was of
great economic value to the SPR, or that any such sold to Council members was done so
improperly. Nor was it considered that any features of the material made it worth
examining in depth before disposal.
It is now possible to see more clearly how the SPR council, at its earlier meeting of 5
June, came to authorise such a sale. The sheer size of the donation cannot have been
appreciated – for example, over twenty volumes of Two Worlds alone, including a
complete sequence of the first twelve volumes. None of the donation however was shown
to the council as a whole; it never entered the SPR office, being stored elsewhere. The
council were not given an estimate of its likely retail value.
Also significantly, most of the council was not provided with the list of surplus items
until some days after they had voted to sell them to council members in the first instance.
The matter was also steered way from the Society’s own Library Committee who never
had the opportunity at a meeting to deliberate over the donation list.
Graver still, it is doubtful if this was in the spirit of the guidance of the Charity
Commission2
on conflicts of interest. All charities are now in a different regime than
before the Charities Act 2006. Processing an outside donation is a more serious
challenge than processing material left by colleagues. Council members were not
reminded of their need to avoid any conflict of interest.
Also relevant is the guidance of the Museums Association on Donations “Ensure the
donor is aware of the financial value and cultural significance of the proposed gift” and
more generally on Disposals, where the need is stressed to give priority to public bodies,
of which university libraries as recipients would be an acceptable example.3

As late as November 2008, an SNU NEC4
member who facilitated the donation still
believed that only copies of the SPR’s own publications had been discarded by Stansted.
But authority to remove the much rarer material had come from a high SNU officer.
As for cultural significance, deep in the list of the donated items is F.G. Lee’s “Glimpses
of the Supernatural” (1875) – volume I or II, or both, not indicated – signed by Mrs
Britten. There are not many books formerly owned by EHB in the Britten Library – could
this one really be spared? Did she use it in compiling any of her works? The SPR did not
want it either, and it was then offered for sale to the SPR council. Its present location is
unknown.
Garth Willey notes:
“Interestingly, I have Vol. I [of “Glimpses”] only. It was given to me by Nora Shaw back
in the mid 1990's because of my interest in ACD [Arthur Conan Doyle]. She'd
purchased it in an SNU sale of surplus books in about 1990 - 1992 (sometime not so long
before I first went to AFC in March 1993). It includes the 'Curnow Collection'
bookplate of books donated by ACD after he'd written History of Spiritualism with
Curnow (1926) plus pencil notes on one page which I believe are ACD's; and the price of
£3. But, of course, the SNU selling off its surplus books to its own members c. 1991 (and
long before Nora became an NEC member) is an entirely different thing to the present
actions.”
At a further SPR council meeting of 4 December, more consideration was given to the
Stansted donation. It was decided that in similar cases in the future such surplus material
should be offered to all SPR members and not just to SPR council members; an
improvement, but still lacking a full awareness of what modern charity practice would
call the public good. It was confirmed that the Society would not resile on the sale of
Stansted material.
Resile is a legal term meaning to go back on an agreement. It signals that the SPR council
has decided not to try to get back the rare Spiritualist material which it offered for sale to
themselves. Bound volumes of Human Nature, Spiritual Magazine and Yorkshire
Spiritual Telegraph- so rare that we don’t know when any volume was last offered for
sale, and cannot therefore put a market value on them – have been privatised without any
but a handful of insiders ever examining the volumes. This is a scandal.
The decision not to resile was taken without council members knowing the price paid by
their council colleagues for particular volumes, nor who those purchasing colleagues
were. There seems to have been a lack of either due diligence or sceptical enquiry here
worrying in a psychical research body.

Biographical Sketch – Robert Cooper
LIGHT, May 6th
, 1899
18?? – 1909
Introductory Note by Psypioneer:
Websites checked for dates for the birth and death of Robert Cooper are incorrect: - all
sites state 1844 -1903. As LIGHT carried no obituary in 1903, Leslie Price made inquiries
to Eastbourne Reference Library, Grove Road, Eastbourne, East Sussex. This was their
reply: -
Thank you for your recent enquiry. Robert Cooper died aged 90 in London on the
5th
November 1909; he was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. 5
This date of death and his age of 90 suggest that the birth date (1844) is also
incorrect on websites visited. Also note that the following LIGHT Biographical
Sketch states he was born at Rotherhithe, in the year 1821 which would make him
around 88 not 90. As with Mrs Duncan, a birth certificate would settle the matter.
Much available reference to Robert Cooper is only in connection with his work with the
Brothers Davenport6
. But his roots are imbedded in the very foundations of British
Spiritualism; he is another prime example of a forgotten Pioneer whose early works
substantially gave lead to the new movement in Great Britain and abroad.

Biographical Sketch
We are indebted to a friend for the following particulars regarding Mr. Robert Cooper,
whose name for about thirty five years has been familiar as that of a zealous and inde-
fatigable worker in the cause of Modern Spiritualism: -
Mr. Cooper was born on the banks of the Thames at Rotherhithe in the year 1821, his
father carrying on business there as an apothecary and surgeon. His father's only brother,
Mr. John Thomas Cooper, was a noted scientist in his day. He was a lecturer on
chemistry, and, as a consulting chemist, did much to develop arts and manufactures in his
time. He was also the first to apply the oxy-hydrogen limelight to the microscope; and his
son, who was chemist at the Polytechnic Institution, was one of the first to popularise
photography. Under his supervision three establishments were started in London, and that
was really the commencement of photographic portraiture in this country by the
daguerreotype process.
Mr. Cooper's parents dying when he was very young, he was placed under the care of
his mother's sister, residing at Eastbourne, of which town his mother was a native. Here
he was educated; and after passing two years at Brighton, and about the same period at
Hastings, in being initiated into the business of chemist and druggist, he commenced
business on his own account at Eastbourne in 1813, soon after marrying a sister of his old
schoolmaster's wife.
Whilst living, as a boy, with his mother's relatives at Eastbourne, he used frequently to
hear of strange occurrences happening to a, young lady, a cousin, who was evidently a
medium. On the death of any member of the family she generally had some intimation of
the event. Thus, on one occasion when a female relative died, a cold white hand came on
hers, as she was about to fill a scuttle with coals in the coal-cellar, which alarmed her so
much that she threw down the shovel, rushed into the sitting-room, and sinking into a
chair covered her face with her hands, and did not speak for some time, when she told
what had happened. On another occasion she was taken by the shoulders and turned
round, when she saw the form of her grandmother, sister of the relative alluded to. These
two old ladies filled the office of postmistress, and one having died the other followed
very soon afterwards. Such was the kind of incident Mr. Cooper was familiar with in his
boyish days. They used to make him feel nervous and afraid to be left alone, especially in
the dark: and when in after years he read Mrs. Crowe's Night Side of Nature, he became
more 'superstitious' than ever. The father of the family was somewhat of a 'freethinker,'
and the wife and daughters, who were piously inclined, were very much concerned about
him. He had an inveterate hatred of `parsons,' and one of his favourite books was Howitt's
`History of Priestcraft.' Thus it will be seen that Mr. Cooper was brought up in a
conflicting religious atmosphere, which, no doubt, accounts for his not entertaining any
settled religious convictions.
During fourteen years he attended regularly the Established Church. Being a lover of
music, the musical portion of the services had a charm for him, and for about a year he
officiated as organist. After his wife's death, although he could not help thinking of her as
288
still living, his mind, being unable to accept the doctrines of the ‘orthodox’ school, began
to assume a materialistic tendency, and he became more sceptical in regard to religion,
and wrote an essay embodying his views. But the remedy which was to solve all his
soul's doubts and difficulties was at hand.
INTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUALISM
In the year 1862, Mr. J. H. Powell came to Eastbourne to lecture on the subject of
Mesmerism. The lectures were attended by Mr. Cooper, who invited Mr. Powell to his
house, when the subject of Spiritualism became the topic of conversation. Mr. Cooper
had just read the article by Robert Bell in the Cornhill, Stranger than Fiction, giving an
account of séances with Mr. Home; and the experiences of Mr. Powell greatly interested
him. A few months afterwards he met Mr. Powell in Holborn, when, after the interchange
of a few remarks, Mr. Powell said, `Would you like to go to a medium? there is one lives
close by'; and Mr. Cooper assenting, they turned into King Street and visited Mrs.
Marshall. The three sat at a small table; and raps promptly came, by which the presence
of `John Colman' was intimated. This was an uncle of Mr. Cooper's who had died a few
weeks before, and to whom Mr. Cooper had been appointed executor. Other
manifestations occurred, but this was the most striking and important. Mr. Powell soon
afterwards, at the suggestion of Mr. Cooper, took up his residence at Eastbourne, where
the subject was followed up, mediums were developed, and much interest was excited;
the matter being taken up by the local newspapers in the town and neighbourhood.
Several clergymen took part in the discussion, and one of them, who lived in some rural
district, said `the matter had gone far enough, and must be put a stop to!' Mr. Cooper,
having seen enough to satisfy himself that Professor Faraday's theory of `involuntary
muscular action' would not account for the movement of tables, wrote to that gentleman,
asking him if he still held to that theory. He received the following letter in reply: -
`ROYAL INSTITUTION.
`January 31st, 1863.
SIR, - My opinion is in no way changed in character, but greatly strengthened.
Nobody has ever been able to show me the effect, therefore, I have no occasion to show a
cause. I do not believe those who say they have seen it. I doubt their competency to
examine facts, and evidence of facts, and think their statements as of no value for the
cause of science and simple truth. When they can lift a table in the air in the presence of
parties adverse to them in opinion, and subject what they think can be done to strict and
cross examination, then it may be worth while to think about the cause.
`Very truly yours,
`R. Cooper, Esq. 'M. FARADAY.'
After further experience Mr. Cooper again wrote, giving a detailed account of
experiments he had made to satisfy himself that the table was not moved by the muscular
289
action of those sitting around it, either voluntarily or involuntarily excited, and that he
had seen a table move without contact. The following is the learned Professor's reply: -
`THE GREEN, HAMPTON COURT,
`September 25th, 1863.
SIR, - I hasten to acknowledge your letter, for I freely admit my belief that you are
perfectly sincere and truthful in your account and experiments; nevertheless I refer you to
my former letter for my answer now. Your observation that you have the greatest
confidence in your colleagues makes me smile when I call to mind certain investigations
that have come to my knowledge in former cases. I do not doubt your competency to
check the facts, if you are willing to work with an unbiassed mind; but I decline to enter
into the matter. `Very truly yours,
`R. Cooper, Esq. `M. FARADAY.'
LECTURING ON SPIRITUALISM
A lecturing tour was now entered upon, commencing with two addresses given by Mr.
Cooper at Eastbourne, at the second of which great astonishment was manifested at an
experiment that was made. A medium went on the platform, and, placing her hands on a
table, loud knocks were made by the legs striking on the floor. Mr. Cooper sat among the
audience with an alphabet in hand. Then these words were spelt out: `You must all
believe in Spiritualism, for the truth will come out.' Mr. Cooper next visited the town
of Lewes, where he received very rough treatment at the hands of a rowdy and bigoted
mob. Hastings and Brighton were afterwards visited, and a lecturing tour, extending to
Southampton, and including the principal towns in the Isle of Wight, was undertaken.
The lectures were not largely attended, but through reports of them in the newspapers
great publicity was given to the subject, and thousands of persons for the first time thus
heard of Modern Spiritualism.
`THE SPIRITUAL TIMES'
The `Spiritual Times' was now started, being the first weekly spiritualist journal
published in England. The first four numbers were ordinary newspaper size, the first page
of which only was devoted to spiritual matter, the remaining three consisting of general
news. It was then resolved to reduce the size of the paper and to devote its columns
wholly to Spiritualism. After a few numbers had been printed in Eastbourne, the work
was undertaken by Mr. Job Cauldwell, 335, Strand, who acted as printer and publisher
for several months, Mr. Powell acting as editor. Then premises were hired in Newman
Street, Oxford Street, at a rental of £140 per annum, where an institution was opened
under the name of the `Spiritual Lyceum,' and was used as a publishing office, reading-
room, &c., where lectures were given and meetings held, and where at length the
`Spiritual Times' was printed and published. All this expense – amounting to about £350
a year – was borne solely by Mr. Cooper. Mr. G. J. Holyoake, Mr. Moncure D, Conway,
290
and the late Mr. Walter Weldon were occasional attendants at the meetings, and the two
former had generally something to say in the way of criticism.
Soon after Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten's arrival in England, arrangements were made
by Mr. Cooper for her to give two lectures in the large hall that formed part of the
premises, then known as `Cambridge Hall.' These were of a most successful character,
the building being filled in every part, and the lecturer being listened to with spell-bound
interest by the enthusiastic audiences. These were considered at the time the best meeting
that had then been held, and it is doubtful whether more important meetings of a popular
character in connection with Spiritualism have since taken place. Mr. Cooper
subsequently hired the Polygraphic Hall, King William Street, afterwards Toole's Theatre
in which Mrs. Britten lectured on Sunday evenings three months, these being the first
regular Sunday in connection with Spiritualism in this country. In consequence of the
action of the Lord's Day Observance Society, who tried to prevent the meetings taking
place, the hall had to be registered as a place of worship. It was accordingly registered as
the `Spiritual Church,' in the names of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Shorter, and Mr. Slater.
EARLY LITERATURE AND MEDIUMS
The 'Spiritual Magazine,' under the editorship of Mr. W. M. Wilkinson, and
containing excellent articles by Mr. Thomas Shorter, Mr. William Howitt and others
appeared monthly, and Mr. Benjamin Coleman was ever active in communicating by
voice and pen the phenomenal facts of Spiritualism to all whom he could in any way
reach. Mr. Home was the most prominent medium of the time; Mrs. Hayden, Mr. Foster,
Mr. Squire, and Mr. Conklin having come from America and returned again. A few
books had also appeared on the subject. One by Mr. Rymer, of Ealing, gave accounts of
seances with Mr. Home. Mr. Shorter had also published an excellent little book entitled
`Confessions of a Truth Seeker.' A reprint of Adin Ballou's `Spirit Manifestations,' with a
long preface by Mr. Andrew Leighton, of Liverpool, had also appeared; and whilst
residing at Eastbourne, Mr. Powell wrote his `Facts and Phases of Spiritualism.' These,
with the first volume of Mr. Home's `Incidents of my Life,' and Mr. Coleman's
`Spiritualism in America,' were the only books that had then been published in England.
Mr. Home. Mrs. Marshall, and her niece Mary, were the best known mediums at the time,
but Mr. Home was only accessible to the select few. Mr. W. Wallace also did good work
as a physical medium and trance-speaker, and was useful as a pioneer is the movement.
THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS
With a view to increase the facilities for the obtaining of evidence by the public, Mr.
Cooper communicated with Dr. H. F. Gardner, of Boston, respecting available and
suitable mediums for the exhibition of phenomena in this country. Among others the
Davenport Brothers were recommended, and Mr. Cooper gave instructions for an
engagement to be made with them to visit England: but he was forestalled by Mr. Palmer,
who had already engaged them, and in due course they arrived, accompanied by the Rev.
Dr. Ferguson. Their success at first was very great, and it seemed as if the public would
be converted to Spiritualism in a sort of wholesale fashion: but the fiasco at Liverpool,
291
when it was alleged that their modus operandi had been discovered, produced a reaction,
and led the public to believe that they were nothing but skilful conjurers; and this
impression amongst the uninformed largely prevails to this day. Similar disturbance
occurred at Huddersfield and one or two other towns, after which the Davenports
proceeded to London. The first séance there was given at the Hanover Square Rooms,
and the proceeds were devoted to the benefit of the `Spiritual Lyceum.' On this occasion
twenty policemen were secreted in a room at the back of the cabinet to be ready in the
event of a disturbance, but their services were not required. These manifestations, being
of a very decisive character, quelled the opposition of the most sceptical. It was admitted
on all hands that the Davenports had triumphed, and vindicated their character as true and
genuine mediums.
Mr Samuel Guppy, who had taken great interest in the mediums, now took them to
Paris, where at a public séance a disturbance similar in character to that at Liverpool took
place: and afterwards only private séances were given, the Emperor Napoleon III having
them twice at his palace, and rewarding them most handsomely.
TRAVEL WITH THE DAVENPORTS
Mr. Cooper, feeling that their work had not been fully done in this country, took the
responsibility on himself, and, after giving a few séances in London and in several
provincial towns, took them to Ireland, where he remained with them foe several weeks,
introducing them at their séances, and defending them in the Press. After visiting the
principal towns in Ireland, a return visit was made to Dublin, and a farewell séance given
in the Rotunda, at the conclusion of which a London policeman put his hand on Mr.
Cooper's shoulder, read a warrant for his apprehension, and took him to the police-
station. Early the following morning the policeman and his prisoner started for London,
where they arrived on Saturday evening; and as no bail could be found at that late hour,
Mr. Cooper had to remain in the police cell until Monday morning, when he had a
hearing before Mr. Knox, a stipendiary magistrate; and was committed for trial at the Old
Bailey on the charge of libelling Mr. Sothern, of `Dundreary' fame. This popular actor
had for some time been making fun of Spiritualism, and acting offensively to
Spiritualists, especially to the Davenports; and Mr. Palmer, who still remained in
England, seeing a paragraph in a New York paper charging Mr. Sothern with
malpractices in that city, incautiously reproduced it in the `Spiritual Times,' while Mr.
Cooper was away in Ireland, and knew nothing about it. The matter was, fortunately,
settled by Mr. Sothern, on the facts being explained to him by Mr. J. G. Crawford, he
agreeing to accept an apology, which was accordingly tendered. Mr. Cooper, however,
had to go through the form of a trial, and was bound in his own recognisances for £500
not to molest the prosecutor for six months.
Mr. Cooper then made arrangements with the Davenports to visit Germany, and spend
a month in Berlin, the Emperor granting the free use of his private concert-room. The
séances excited great interest and produced a very favourable impression. After a week in
Hamburg, the principal towns in Belgium and Holland were visited. In Russia the
Davenports were very successful, particularly ire the presence of the Imperial family; but
292
Mr. Cooper, though urgently pressed to do so, was not able to accompany them to that
country, being unable to leave England.
In 1867 Mr. Cooper published a volume entitled `Spiritual Experiences; and Seven
Months with the Brothers Davenport.' This book, which is out of print, gives a fascinating
account of Mr. Cooper's early experiences, lecturing tours, and a full description of his
European travels with the Davenports.
On returning from the Continent the Davenports proposed to return to America
forthwith, but Mr. Cooper further engaged them for six weeks, for which they were to
receive £200, Mr. Cooper taking the responsibility of the séances upon himself. The
principal suburbs of the Metropolis were visited, finishing with a week at Birmingham.
As the receipts only covered the working expenses, Mr. Cooper was £200 out of pocket
by this venture. Feeling that he could no longer sustain single-handed the responsibilities
of the public advocacy of Spiritualism, he gave up the Lyceum and the `Spiritual Times,'
and retired from the scene of his activity, to which he had devoted four years of his life.
Mr. William Howitt, who had assisted Mr. Cooper by his counsel and personal
influence in many ways, wrote thus to him: -
`DEAR SIR, - Thank you for your little volume of `Spiritual Experiences.' I consider
it a very valuable addition to the history and evidences of this great dispensation. Some
parts of it read like a narration of the persecution of days gone by; of the Quakers or
Methodists, especially in your being hauled away to the dirty lock-ups and English
police-courts.
If our press and scientific men could blush, the account of the rational reception of the
Davenports in Belgium Holland, and Russia, would make them do it; but there is no
country on the face of the earth which is so arrogant and so materialised in spirit. They
think themselves `the people and that wisdom will die with them'; but in all except what
relates to matter and material operations and money getting, they are the stupidest people
living. Material science has made great progress among them, but it has been at the
expense of everything that marks the truly philosophic mind. The theories of philosophy
never were so grovelling and degraded. If there be a thing that marks the glory and
dignity of human character, that, they reject and spurn from them. They desire not to live
hereafter, and they prefer believing that they are descendants of monkeys than the
directly created children of God. Is it possible to conceive of a more earthly and
contemptible generation? Let us bless God that He has wrenched us, by unexampled
revelations from the unseen, from the thraldom of such stupidity. You, indeed, must feel
great satisfaction in the service you have been permitted, and have had the will, to render.
You will have your reward.
Yours faithfully,
'WILLIAM HOWITT.'
`Robert Cooper, Esq.

WORK IN AMERICA
In 1874 Mr. .J. J. Morse visited America on a lecturing tour, where he spent a year.
Mr. Cooper, who followed him a month later, was with him, and remained there five
years after his departure. The first person he visited on his arrival in New York City was
Mr. Andrew .Jackson Davis, who offered to give him an introduction to certain Spiritual-
ists. Mr. Cooper said he had a letter of introduction from Mrs. Cora L. V. Richmond, on
reading which Mr. Davis remarked, `That will carry you all over America.' That lady had
also given him special letters of introduction to William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell
Phillips. Mr. Coleman had also given him letters of introduction to Epes Sargent and
others. Mr. Cooper therefore found plenty of friends.
During his six, years' residence, principally in Boston, he did a good work in a quiet
way. He was first to make known among others the wonderful powers of Mrs. M. B.
Thayer, the `flower medium'; and by giving accounts of séances in the spiritual papers,
the `Boston Herald' and the `Boston Investigator,' he rendered essential service in
spreading a knowledge of spiritual truth. When Mr. Cooper arrived in Boston, owing to
dissensions, Mr. Morse's lectures were the last given under the auspices of the `Music
Hall Society.' Months passed and nothing was being done in the way of lectures. Mr.
Cooper consulted Mrs. Britten, who consented to give four lectures without a fee. Mr.
Luther Colby, editor of the `Banner of Light,' agreed to pay the rent of a hall for four
Sundays, and thus lectures were started and have been going on ever since. Mr. W. J.
Colville was met by Mr. Cooper at the steamboat wharf, and got him an engagement the
first Sunday after his arrival. He was also instrumental in giving, through C. E. Watkins,
satisfactory evidence of spirit phenomena to the Rev. Minot .J. Savage, one of the most
popular and influential clergymen in Boston, who has not hid his light under a bushel.
But space will not allow a more extended notice of the work done by Mr. Cooper, for
which he never received a dollar's remuneration. Since his return to England he has lived
quietly at Eastbourne, where he still endeavours to keep the subject, whenever an
opportunity occurs, before the public. Mr. Cooper is now an invalid; never having
recovered from a serious tricycle accident sustained several years ago, which
incapacitates him from walking.
_______________
Points of interest noted by Paul Gaunt
Robert Cooper it appears was not the only Spiritualist in his family, J.H. Powell records
in his Spiritualism; its Facts and Phases, F. Pitman London 1864 on pages 33 -34:
Mr. Cooper has discovered a medium in his own house, and one that
promises to yield us some of the higher and more enticing phases of the spiritual
subject. His daughter, Mary, a girl of some 14 years, has lately been receiving
communications from the Spirits in legible, bold, written characters. She
294
likewise has elicited a few attempts at spirit-drawing, all of which betray design
and open up fields for thought to traverse and doubt to disappear.
Her mediumship does not stop here. Some very good organ music has been
heard, her fingers being moved and pressed on the notes with a mechanical
perfection, beyond her own will, and without her own conception of the notes
constituting the music evoked.
In carefully inspecting some of the specimens of spirit-writing, it is easy to
discover a visible similitude in the formation of some of the letters to the same
letters forming a sentence in the communicating Spirit's handwriting when on
earth. This is substantiated. The Sentence, I LOVE YOU AND WANT YOU TO
LOVE GOD, was one of the first sentences written through Miss Cooper's
mediumship. Afterwards the name of a Spirit was requested to be written, and
the autograph of Mr. Cooper's grandmother appeared on the paper MARY
COOPER.
Mr. Cooper produced a book which is a family legacy, and in which is
written Mary Cooper, the grandmother's own hand-writing. The wonderful
similarity of the spirit-autograph with the one in the book must give an
impetus to the magnetic scape-goat which will frighten it into oblivion.
Powell a practising Mesmerist makes an interesting distinction between higher phases in
the early Spiritualist Phenomena, from the physical to psychological. From Hayden’s
visit in 1852, physical mediumship was primary but grew slowly in England, e.g, Mrs.
Everitt,7
, Miss Nichols (later Mrs. Guppy), Mrs. Marshall, Madame Besson (a French
medium working in London) and D.D. Home when in Britain.
The Spiritual Times
The first weekly spiritualist journal published in England; its history however, is not
clear, Cooper states in his book8
on page 74:
I determined to start a paper of my own, which I did under the title of the
‘Spiritual Times and Weekly News.’ Five numbers only appeared in this
form, and the title was then altered to ‘Spiritual Times,’ and the contents
restricted to spiritual and kindred topics. This was printed for several weeks
at Eastbourne, but, the bulk of our subscribers and contributors, being
spread over England and the major part of them living in London, it was

/2d and attempted an usual format in which an opening page
covered spiritualism, while the other three consisted of weekly news - much of it
second hand – selected (or, more often apparently, not) and presented in a
manner which would have belonged in almost any weekly newspaper of the
period. From number six, though, the format was smaller, eight-paged instead of
four, and cost 2d; the content as now devoted much more to spiritualism. In this,
spiritualism was seen as vindicating Christianity.11
Between numbers 6 and 118,
little seems to have changed in either content or advertisements. For most of the
time, the proprietor was Robert Cooper of Eastbourne,12
and when his apparently
heavy financial support came to an end, the paper evidently found itself to be
insupportable, despite attracting donations amounting to £60.13

The Spiritual Times (Periodical)
British Spiritualist weekly, published in London from 1864-66, edited by J.H.
Powell and W.H. Harrison.
We find an additional editor W.H. Harrison presumably the same editor who in 1869
was to establish and edit the British weekly; - The Spiritualist.
Hartmann’s Who’s Who15
has this to say:
Periodicals Discontinued
Spiritual Times (England) Edited by Mr. W.H. Harrison. First published in
1864.
Interesting here to note Logie Barrow’s remarks: - For most of the time, the
proprietor was Robert Cooper of Eastbourne. Barrow also stated, that the 118 issues of
the Spiritual Times finished 1st
October 1866 (note 9), but we find ten months later in The
Spiritual Magazine August 1st
1867 on page 378 under the title:
British – Weekly Journals
The Spiritual Times, Editor J.H. Powell, London.
We also find in volume 1 1867 of Human Nature page 241: ……..Afterwards J.H.
Powell, late editor of the Spiritual Times read an ode…….
If these references are to be relied upon, the Spiritual Times possibly exceeded the
generally given life of 1864 -66, still being advertised in August 1867! In a major
Spiritualist publication The Spiritual Magazine, and in another major journal of the same
year, Human Nature (Non-Christian – Progressive Spiritualism) founded and edited by
James Burns who informs us that J.H. Powell, was the late editor, of the Spiritual Times
but this short statement does not suggest the paper’s closure!
Emma Harding Britten brings our attention to the demise of the Spiritual Times and the
end to Cooper’s possible involvement with his paper, in her Nineteenth Century Miracles
(N.C.M.) first published by her husband William Britten in 1883 page 209:
Of the other periodicals connected with the movement, it is only necessary to say, the first
metropolitan journal that was issued as a weekly organ was published by Mr. Robert
Cooper, and called The Spiritual Times.

The unfortunate prosecution incurred by Mr. Coleman, involving in its results the
publisher of this paper, occasioned its suspension after a short lived existence.
If we back track to page 193 of N.C.M., we find this short explanation:
Mr. Sothern, a popular actor, who under the alias of "Stuart," had once been
the conductor of the well-known "miracle-circle" of New York, thought proper to
amuse his English associates by contriving all sorts of caricature performances
calculated to bring ridicule and discredit upon Spiritualism.
Mr. Benjamin Coleman in his zeal for the cause he espoused, in exposing Mr.
Sothern's performances, unfortunately republished certain statements copied from
the New York papers, which gave the pretext for a prosecution on the ground of
libel. A trial ensued. The well-known aphorism that "truth is a libel" obtained
with unmistakable force in this case, and Mr. Coleman and his publisher, the
editor of the paper called The Spiritual Times, were mulcted in heavy damages.
Benjamin Coleman wrote a monthly column in The Spiritual Magazine called ‘Passing
Events - The Spread of Spiritualism’ and this is where the offending article was
published. Mr. Sothern, who’s full name was Edward Askew Sothern, worked as an actor
under the name Douglas Stuart at Barnum’s Museum, New York.
Robert Cooper was arrested in Dublin as a result of the Sothern libel charge; in fact
according to Cooper his editor Powell incautiously made reference to the offending
material without his knowledge.
Below is taken from The Spiritual Magazine March 1866: -
MR SOTHERN AND SPIRITUALISM
PROCEEDINGS have been taken by Mr. Sothern against the Spiritual Times, in
respect of two passages in the article which was quoted in full in that journal from an
editorial article which appeared in the New York Sunday Times of the 31st December
last; and by means of that publication in the Spiritual Times Mr. Sothern's character is
no doubt seriously challenged in the two points alluded to. For this the editor has made
the fullest apology, as indeed he ought as a gentleman to do, and without the slightest
reservation.
In this journal the passages complained of were not inserted, but the material words
were expunged, and their place supplied by asterisks, and it was not intended that a
prejudice should be raised against Mr. Sothern in those matters.
We are bound however to say, that as a contrary impression prevails with Mr. Sothern,
to the fullest extent that such impression is well founded, either with him or others, we
entirely repudiate and retract any charge or intention to make a charge on those matters,
which were out of the knowledge of the writer of the article, or of any one known to us.
298
So much we feel bound to say in justice to Mr. Sothern with regard to those two
inculpated points, and if we could use more expressive language we would do so in
repudiation of any such charges against his character.
But this New York article16
was produced in answer to Mr. Sothern's letter to the
Glasgow Citizen, in which he uses the most opprobrious epithets against this journal and
against Spiritualism and Spiritualists. Spiritualism, he says, is a delusion, a snare, and a
swindle, and Spiritualists are personally guilty of imbecility, irreligion, fraud, impudent
chicanery, and blasphemous indecency. We do not know if the proverb that one man may
steal a horse whilst another may not even look over the hedge, be true, but surely
Spiritualists are to be allowed to be angry at such epithets as these, even if they cannot
appeal to the law. But in addition to these charges, Mr. Sothern professed to expose the
hitherto believed doings of the famous Miracle Circle17
of which he was a member, and
gave an entirely new version of its proceedings, on his personal veracity. It is mainly in
answer to this that the New York article was written; and it was a great and culpable
error, that in reproducing it in this journal every word on the other subjects was not
rigidly expunged. This is what requires an apology to him and withdrawal, and which is
fully tendered to him. But surely there is something which he also should say in
withdrawing the offensive charges which he has made, and with respect to which the
written testimony of several of the members of the Miracle Circle has been received.
These gentlemen's written declaration leaves the matter in no doubt as to Mr. Sothern's
position in America with regard to Spiritualism, and which position is utterly at variance,
as his companions allege, with the facts he states in his letter; and upon this question of
Mr. Sothern's veracity as to the Miracle Circle, rests the whole basis of his opprobrious
statements against Spiritualists. There remains also the attitude which Mr. Sothern has
taken up in London in playing what he may call hoaxes, at Holloway, Maida-hill, and St.
John's-wood. He certainly should feel himself bound to apologize for all these things, but
whether he do so or not, there is no difficulty on our part in making the amplest apology
to him for any reference being made to the two paragraphs in question.
The above was written before the hearing of Mr. Sothern's proceedings against our
publisher and Mr. Coleman. We only wish to add that Messrs. Kent, the publishers, are
quite innocent of any knowledge of the contents of the Magazine.
________
The Spiritual Magazine for 1866 and 1867 gives no notice that I have found to
substantiate the paper’s closure or change of ownership in October 1866.

As stated by Logie Barrow, Robert Cooper was not the proprietor for the entire life
of the paper and gives no indication who else was involved. Was the other
proprietor W.H. Harrison? If this is the case the Spiritual Times would be the
forerunner to The Spiritualist in 1869, but this is just speculation. My personal
suggestion would be that the Harrison entry is a misprint.
Incidentally, Barrow makes no reference to Benjamin Coleman or Edward Sothern’s
libel action.
Psypioneer would be grateful for any further information on this first British
Spiritualist weekly – The Spiritual Times.

EARLY SPIRITUALIST NEWSPAPERS
Points of reference noted in LIGHT May 5, 1923 page 287
Spiritualistic journalism, like other journalism, has gone through many changes and
there is a relatively long roll of extinct periodicals.
We believe that the first regular journal established was the “Yorkshire Spiritual
Telegraph” (a monthly), first published in 1855. In 1857 its name was changed to the
“British Spiritual Telegraph” and it ran until the year 1859.
Another monthly journal, the “Spiritual Herald,” started in 1856, and continued for six
months.
A third monthly first published in 1860 was the “Spiritual Magazine,” which lasted for
eighteen years. It was edited by Mr. W.M. Wilkinson and Mr. Thomas Shorter. The latter
gentleman, by the way, we knew personally as a man of high intelligence and fine
qualities of character.
The first weekly, the “Spiritual Times,” appeared in 1864; then came “Daybreak,”
another weekly which first appeared in 1867, its name being changed to “Medium and
Daybreak” in 1868. That journal we knew well, and also its editor, Mr. James Burns, one
of the Scottish veterans of Spiritualism.
Other magazines were: “Human Nature” 1867, the “Spiritualist” 1869, the “Spiritual
News” 1871, the “Christian Spiritualist,” also 1871, the “Spiritual News,” 1878, and the
“Psychological Review,” 1878. We have given some of these particulars before, but in
view of the growing enquiry on the part of collectors of the early literature of
Spiritualism, it may be useful to repeat the information.

Notes by the way
ONE SMALL STEP FOR PSYPIONEER
In January 2009, Psypioneer will become a Journal after four and half years of infancy as
a Newsletter. This change is an acknowledgment of a reality that has gradually become
apparent, and which had prompted letters to Paul Gaunt the editor asking why we still
called ourselves just a Newsletter.
Readers will notice one or two new features, such as more use of images, but our general
way of working will be unchanged. We remain just electronic not paper based, and we
remain free. Although some presidents and vice-presidents of related organisations read
“Psypioneer” we are glad that any student with net access can obtain this and every issue
at no charge.
Actual news will remain a core function. It is no secret that news of the psychic is often
reported only in part by traditional psychic media. The recent troubles in ISF, for
example, were revealed first by www.paranormalreview.com, some of whose stories
were then reprinted. In July 2008 we reported that there was a new full biography of
William Crookes by Brock- such an event would have been a big story in the days of
Maurice Barbanell, who wrote thousands of words about Crookes, but today it is not
much reported. In June 2008 we drew attention to some implications of a love affair
between a famous medium and an SPR president, though he was not in that office at the
time. This story too has received only a muted response in psychic newspapers.
Spiritualist history continues to be a central focus. There is much that is unexplained
about the life and work of such personalities as Stainton Moses, Emma Hardinge Britten,
and (across the water) A .J. Davis and the Fox Sisters. We are proud to be part of the
attempt to discover when the sisters were born. At last, we have begun to cover the
legacy of Kardec, which spread from France to cover the world. (Shortly we will resume
coverage of the 1875 Aksakov controversy.) We have new information coming about the
International Institute, whose beginning we described in September 2005, and which was
important to Arthur Findlay.
Our friends in the theosophical history community (www.theohistory.org) provide
essential cooperation, and we have long been inspired by the achievement of
www.blavatskyarchives.org in putting archival material on line. We also intend to further
examine the origins of such Christian bodies as CFPSS - and have a further discovery
soon about their first hon. secretary, Maurice Elliott, made at the Congregational Library.
We have acknowledged before the aid of our initial donors such as STF and CPS; our
first web master Tony Hern who died during this year; the facilities granted by such
libraries as CPS, SPR, CFPSS and TS; and those who help to make us known. Although
we report history, and occasionally make history, Spiritualist bodies in particular seem
quite shy of drawing the attention of their members and students to our existence - one
exception is Spiritual News, which has even reprinted a couple of stories. We welcome
302
this. We have enjoyed close cooperation with Garth Willey at our web hosts Woodland
Way in Australia, and are in constant touch with him in the editing process.
Psypioneer Journal will have over 260 subscribers – a modest number. Although they
include many leading people in this field, we had a forceful reminder in 2008 of how
limited our impact is, when both the SNU and SPR became entangled in the Stansted
donation. Neither seems to have thought of cooperating with Psypioneer.
Because all copies of Psypioneer are preserved on line at www.woodlandway.org, and
can be searched there, it has built up into a significant educational resource and
information exchange. Whatever your attitude to earlier work in the psychic field, we
hope you will read the new Journal, and recommend us to your fellow students.

Correction…
PP4.10 October – Conan Doyle Movietone Newsreel
With reference to the commentary on ACD’s Movietone interview, we received a letter
advising and pointing out:
I enjoyed the Conan Doyle feature in 4.10, but we can't have Windlesham in Surrey!
There is a village of Windlesham in Surrey, but ACD's house of that name (which he
thought of calling Swindlesham!) was of course on the outskirts of Crowborough in
Sussex – now a care home for the elderly but visit-able if tact and diplomacy are
exercised!
To which Garth Willey responds:
Whoops! Quite right: his previous home, ‘Undershaw,’ was at Hindhead in Surrey. (Still
is, I think, but it has been the subject of redevelopment or preservation proposals over
recent years and I’m not certain as to the current status.) I'll get it changed on
www.woodlandway.org - both in the write up alongside the ACD video and in the
archived PP4.10.
Please thank our correspondent for his sharp eye - and my apologies. Yes, ACD referred
to it as Swindlesham when the building costs went thru the roof! (metaphorically
speaking!).

JUNG AND PSYCHIC STUDIES
The psychologist C.G. Jung (1875-1961) has a respected place in psychic studies. He was
an early investigator of mediumship, as described in the monograph “Spiritualism and the
Foundations of C.G. Jung’s Psychology” (1993) by F.X. Charet,19
for whom Jung was
also the focus for spontaneous phenomena. His theoretical ideas have influenced many
students.
It is common to find allusions on the lines of “As Jung said…” or “Jung believed”.
Caution should be exercised for several reasons. Jung wrote primarily in German. The
English and German text sometimes differs. Some of Jung’s work is not included in the
“Collected Works” series. Reference is often made to a book “Memories, Dreams,
Reflections” (1963) but despite the use of the first person, material from Jung in this book
has been shortened and considerably filtered in the editorial process.
Other biographical accounts of Jung have been based on limited sources. A recent
assessment is “Jung stripped bare by his biographers, even.” (London, Karnac, 2005) by
Sonu Shamdasani.
A new start in publishing Jung is being made by the Philemon Foundation.20
We hope to locate some early references to Jung in the pioneer literature.

Tribute to MISS JACQUELINE
By J.B. McINDOE21
Introductory Note by Psypioneer:
In our June 200822
issue, we reported on a claimed link between Winston
Churchill and a medium called Jacqueline Churchill, and we promised more information
on a medium “Miss Jacqueline” who was certainly active at that time. Here it is.
Taken from The Two Worlds May 13, 1949 page 148:
_________________
Miss Jacqueline passed on, after a long illness, on Tuesday, April 26th, in a nursing
home in Hove. Only her personal friends knew her real name, for she had adopted the
name Miss Jacqueline as a musical comedy actress and continued to use it in her psychic
work.
A lecture by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle started her investigations into Spiritualism, and
she soon discovered that she had psychic powers of her own, and ultimately became a
professional medium.
My first meeting with her was in Edinburgh at the Psychic College. Mrs. Hewat
McKenzie met her there also, and was greatly impressed with her work. Writing in the
April 1933 issue of "Psychic Science," she said, "I feel that it is a gain to find another
worker able to demonstrate so efficiently in public." Soon after, Miss Jacqueline joined
the staff of the British College, and adding platform work to her private sittings soon
became a popular lecturer and demonstrator.
A Prediction
She excelled as a psychometrist and usually supplemented her readings with
clairvoyance and often with health diagnoses.
She frequently adopted a very interesting method in her platform psychometry. A
volunteer would be invited to the platform, to take one of the articles on the tray and hold
it in his hand, while she gave the reading. This she claimed to do by interpreting his
posture and gestures etc., while holding the article.
That she would be a medium had been predicted before she was born. Her grandfather
was a Wesleyan Missionary. He had saved the life of Missionary. African chief, and in
21
Spiritualists’ National Union – President John B. McIndoe 1930 – 1938. His name in some articles /
references is spelt M'Indoe see page 5: - http://woodlandway.org/PDF/PP4.1January08..pdf
22
Sitting with Churchill and King see page 132; - http://woodlandway.org/PDF/PP4.6June08..pdf
305
expressing his thanks the chief said that one of his grandchildren would "have the gift of
sight." When she was born, her grandfather declared that she was the grandchild
indicated. Her career amply justified the prediction.
A Happy Release
During the early years of the late war she carried on a semi-private circle in a drawing
room in Kensington. There one met people of almost every rank in society, assembled to
hear "Ahmed," her control. A paralytic stroke ended her mediumistic career and for the
two or three years she has been an almost helpless invalid in a nursing home she herself
selected psychically. There she was treated with the utmost care and indeed with
affection.
Ever since I knew her she seemed to have a lot of people dependent on her, not only
for advice and guidance, but for material help. When I saw her a few days before her
passing she new she was going soon. She was looking forward to a happy release and a
welcome reunion with many friends.
I think Walt Whitman's lines would fitly express her attitude.
Joy, shipmate, joy.
Pleased to my soul at death I cry,
The long, long anchorage is o’ er
The ship is free,
She leaps and courses boldly from the shore.
Joy, shipmate. Joy.
At her own request I conducted the cremation service at Golders Green on Saturday,
30th
April.

Can any of our readers help David Taylor?
STONE TAPE THEORY
I am researching the origins of what has become known as the ‘Stone Tape Theory’ for
apparitions and hauntings (the belief that memories or impressions of past events can
become ‘recorded’ onto a particular area). The title of the theory is taken after the 1970’s
TV drama by Nigel Kneale.
I am currently tracing its origins back to the 1840’s-1880’s. Key figures seem to be Mrs.
Eleanor Sidgwick, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William F Barrett and Annie Besant.
I believe that the origins of this theory may be traced back to animistic beliefs found in
Hinduism (an early influence on Besant and Theosophy) and in the practice of
psychometry.
I know that Frank Podmore and Annie Besant were both associated with the Fabian
Society at the same time. Perhaps Barrett was influenced by Besant’s ideas/beliefs about
Theosophy/Hinduism/Animism and he made the theory popular with prominent members
of the SPR at the time.
Can anyone help prove/disprove this theory?
David can be contacted direct as indicated below, or through Psypioneer if
preferred.

Have you been reading your Psypioneer?
Not every subscriber does. We were surprised in November to find an editor of a
Spiritualist newspaper who had not heard of the Stansted donation, after two front page
stories about it. “You’ve not been reading your Psypioneer!” was the obvious response.
Why not test your memory of the past year with the following quiz, in which each
question refers successively to an issue, beginning with January 2008?
1) What was Mrs Miller’s gift?
2) Who struck a new note in Psychic News
3) Who convened the meeting at which the ISF was first proposed?
4) Who was suggested as the most influential Spiritualist?
5) Where was physical mediumship filmed in infra-red in 1960?
6) What did Mrs Duncan say when invited to sit at the SPR?
7) How old was Madame Blavatsky’s first husband when he married her?
8) What was Sir Oliver Lodge’s connection with organised Spiritualism?
9) What journal was saved this month by a godly repentance?
10) Where is the grave of Stainton Moses?
11) When was Helen Duncan born?
12) What became of the Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph?

What’s in a name?
Below is taken from LIGHT January 9, 1936 page 25
LOOKING ROUND THE WORLD
TWO ELLIOTTS
WHAT'S in a name? Well, there are possibilities of confusion. Recently, two London
clergymen named Elliott have been "in the news," and quite a number of people have
been mystified by their doings and sayings because they have supposed there was
only one.
The Rev. Maurice Elliott, Vicar of St. Peter's, Cricklewood, is an ardent
Spiritualist, and is Hon. Secretary of the Order of the Preparation for the Communion
of Souls, which has played so prominent a part in the recent "Confraternity" meetings
in the Fortune Theatre, London, and about which a good deal more will yet be heard.
The Rev. W. H. Elliott is Vicar of St. Michael's, Chester Square, London, and is
deservedly famous as a broadcast preacher – his mid-week services each Thursday
evening at 10 o'clock being amongst the most popular of the B.B.C. regular features.
And, as we have had occasion to point out, he delivers discourses which include most
of the implications of Spiritualism, but without reference to the possibility of
communication or to the definite evidence of Survival presented by Spiritualism.
The confusion arises because many people suppose these two Elliotts to be one
and the same.
THE “OTHER FELLOW'S " VIEW
In the most recent of his broadcast addresses – that on the second evening of 1936
– W. H. Elliott delivered a New Year message which might be taken to heart by
Spiritualists – and also by the detractors of Spiritualism who are, unfortunately, still
so numerous in the various Christian Churches. It was that each one should be willing
and anxious, not only to understand the "other fellow's point of view, but to allow that
the" other fellow "might be – and probably is – as conscientious and as devoted to
truth as those who disagree with him. If Christian preachers generally took up that
attitude, there would be an end to the wild and foolish accusations against
Spiritualists and Spiritualism which are now so much in evidence, and there would be
a better chance that Christians of all denominations would realise that Spiritualism is
their potential ally in the common fight against Materialism, which is the real enemy.
309
Until this desirable state of affairs is brought about, Spiritualists must realise, as
best they may, that their detractors may be honest, even if they are often badly -
informed, and sometimes mistake bigotry for religious zeal. Even Father Knapp may
think he is fulfilling his mission as a Roman Catholic priest when he is slandering
Spiritualism.
