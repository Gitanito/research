    IF   YOU...  
  ...have ever wondered what will happen when you die?
  ...have ever been weighed down with doubt and worry about the meaning of life?
  ...have ever had a heart attack, stroke or similar life-threatening experience   or know someone else who has?
  ...have a friend who's in need of a gentle boost toward happiness?

If so, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; is a must-read,   and a gift that will continue to give, reading after reading. It has the answers   that will give you peace of mind, help you live a richer, fuller life, and end   your fear of death forever.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I read Jim's book and was very impressed.&nbsp; Jim is a Canadian Radio   Personality on CJBX 1290 Newstalk.&nbsp; I read hundreds of NDEs - and his is a   core experience.&nbsp; The part that drew my attention was the intense fear of   death that set off a chain of events that led to an eventual heart attack.&nbsp;   The transformation that happened is truly inspirational.&nbsp; I would recommend   this book heartily.&nbsp; It is short, easy to read, but contains a very human   element that is so refreshing to read in a book format.&nbsp; He also has a   wonderful CD available where he reads excerpts from the book.&nbsp; He also has   some transformative material that is not contained in the book.&nbsp; All   proceeds go to local charities.&nbsp; For more information visit   www.jimchapman.ca&nbsp;   (519) 686-2525
