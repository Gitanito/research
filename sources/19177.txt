I&#39;ve been warning about this for decades.
♪
(sirens wailing)
♪
No, not that. This.
The truth is out there?
Speaking of conspiracy theories
the Corona relief bill
contains a provision that hasn&#39;t gotten
It directs the Director of National Intelligence,
in consultation with the Secretary of Defense
to disclose what they know about UFOs
So what are they gonna tell us?
I provided briefings
foreign heads of state, generals,
and a sitting CIA director,
I&#39;ve seen lives destroyed...
William Colby has been missing
His canoe was found washed up
...friends murdered,
unthinkable evil unleashed on our planet,
all to protect this illegal
And nothing I&#39;ve seen scares me more
we&#39;re living through.
We&#39;re in the final hour of an agenda
for nearly a century.
Centralized monopolies of power
the defense industry,
and the corporate media
are all converging on the same narrative:
that extraterrestrials are real,
they&#39;re here,
and they&#39;re a threat.
Those are not weather balloons.
Those are clearly autonomous aircraft
swarming U.S. military craft.
-These are craft under intelligent control.
These are craft under intelligent control,
and they&#39;re flying with impunity, Tucker,
and they can outmaneuver, outperform
We need to find out
and also, what the intent is.
The truth is, we do know
Some are indeed extraterrestrial.
And they are absolutely not a threat,
It is in fact the secrecy
to life on Earth and beyond,
as stated by the first CIA director,
(unsettling music)
In 2020, I was asked to brief
on a situation that completely
They had been lied to
and we cannot stop what is coming
♪
(piano music)
This may be one of the most
A dissection of an unknown humanoid
It clearly isn&#39;t human.
I don&#39;t call it extraterrestrial
We don&#39;t have the history
We don&#39;t have the genetics on it.
And there are a group of doctors
and then there are suits,
very much that look
on the perimeter, watching.
A woman called me up a few months ago
whose mother was a seamstress
and built the covering for the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
So she was cleared
She was then of course moved
in the world, at Walker Field,
At that time,
How do we know?
We tested the paper to establish
And it&#39;s a photo of a photograph.
So we do a whole research project on it.
We have it analyzed by the top
Dr. Burns in Manhattan,
who establishes that it is the 1920s.
We have the top clothing experts
determine that those absolutely
So, medically, clothing, everything.
But if it is what we think it is,
it means that there had been
of extraterrestrial materiel and beings
for 20, 25 years before Roswell.
And that opens another whole chapter.
Now, the reason I think
I&#39;ve had members of my team
and in the classified projects
who have seen top-secret files
and early 1900s, dealing with ETs,
So everyone thinks everything happened
This goes back longer.
Think about that.
At least 100 years of UFO secrecy.
Do you really think this guy
or this guy...
Look, here&#39;s the deal.
...or, God forbid, this guy
Excuse me, I didn&#39;t mean
They don&#39;t.
This is why heads of state
a retired medical doctor,
to get the truth about this phenomenon.
And sadly, they don&#39;t have the power
once they know the truth.
In 2001, I brought together
and aerospace whistleblowers
in Washington, D.C.,
for a press conference
The men and women
and the some 350 additional
to the so-called UFO matter
can prove and will prove
This marked the public debut
and the launch of the global
to end UFO secrecy
that would end poverty, climate change,
and transform every aspect
One of the biggest bombshells
was the testimony of Carol Rosin,
an aerospace executive who worked
the Nazi rocket scientist
to work for NASA.
Carol received his deathbed confession,
a testimony so terrifying
trying to warn about it.
Now, here was von Braun
explaining to me that he was told
but that he was going to stay alive
what the real game is
And it started out
the Russians were the threat.
We had to build space-based
and then Third World countries,
called &quot;nations of concern&quot;
And then, the asteroid threat,
that we could just put weapons up there
And then it leads to the last card.
And then he would repeat to me
&quot;And the last card, the last card,
the extraterrestrial threat.&quot;
He explained to me
that there was a moment
that the extraterrestrial beings,
and they were not.
These craft that have come here
they&#39;re identified flying objects,
and we know that they have beings in them.
And we have witnesses here
that they can shut down
they can stop a rocket
We have witnesses here
who have worked
who have the courage
to support what Wernher von Braun told me
At the end, I said,
Well, it&#39;s still all a lie.
The ultimate dream
the military-industrial complex,
is to have this war with a potential
It&#39;s their dream of all times.
You can roll into place
of a national security state.
You can spend literally
on massive military equipment,
So it&#39;s logical that they would use that
And we do know,
that the utilization
to initiate a war
Our human family does that.
The nation states do that.
Hitler has done it.
They dress up troops looking like
they want to invade,
have their own troops
and pretend they&#39;ve assaulted somebody,
then they rush in
It&#39;s gone on and on.
Flashback to September 11th, 2001.
The world is in shock.
The American people are paralyzed
Over the next few days,
an unprecedented show
Americans fly their flag from every car
and hang them outside their homes.
They unify around an overwhelmed president,
brought together as one
Few raised an eyebrow
as constitutionally protected freedoms
and the war drum beat
The 9/11 attack set the stage
that had been preplanned for years,
as General Wesley Clark revealed
He said, &quot;I just got this
meaning the Secretary of Defense&#39;s office,
&quot;This is a memo that describes
seven countries in five years,
starting with Iraq,
Libya, Somalia, Sudan,
I said, &quot;Is it classified?&quot;
He said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
I said--I said,
When von Braun talked to me
he called it a faked alien invasion
I saw on a board
we were gonna build
I called Wesley Clark
And I said, well, you know,
And he said,
what is it about,
and the guy at the desk said,
I said, &quot;We&#39;re going to war
He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
In its paper published in 2000,
Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses,
the neoconservative think-tank
asserted that only a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot;
for the military and defense policy
Indeed, these traumatizing events
in order to manipulate perception
for military action
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and others
long before Colin Powell
I feel like it was the lowest point
that I had a hand in managing it.
But we&#39;ve come a long way
That same document that called for
goes on to describe how we need
and even predicts
For a complete fascist takeover,
the men behind the curtain
a cosmic 9/11.
This temptation to generate
on the part of some
you know, you even hear
make reference to it.
Perhaps we need
to make us recognize
I occasionally think how quickly
if we were facing an alien threat
Oh, wouldn&#39;t it be clear
being attacked by
We&#39;d finally all come together.
Wouldn&#39;t that be really lovely?
Well, it&#39;s not really lovely
They don&#39;t want to lose
They wanna use up all that
The Last Card was the most profound
and I accepted the mission.
And until Steven Greer picked me up
to the Disclosure Project,
when I had just about given up,
that&#39;s when I saw
to what&#39;s going on,
to the truth,
When she told me
it didn&#39;t surprise me,
because I had previously met
in the defense industry
who had already told me
and that it could be actuated
and that that was what
Keep the technologies away
of fossil fuel and all this.
When we&#39;re ready to pull the trigger
spin it in the direction that benefits
the people holding these secrets.
But it was interesting to hear
that he had been warning her about this,
and we know that those systems
in the late &#39;40s and &#39;50s.
Truth seekers who explore
walk an extremely dangerous path.
Most get sucked into the gravitational pull
where lies about the UFO cover-up
poison the minds of even the smartest
These lies include:
And the worst one of all:
If we cannot commit
to no war in space,
then we&#39;re going to continue
and we&#39;re going to continue
that we&#39;re in right now
towards our own human extinction.
One of the difficult things
was that I learned
that had been feeding false information
had their counterparts that had been
providing some information
So the way really good
or disinformation works,
is that at the core of it,
So they&#39;d say, &quot;Okay,
and here&#39;s some evidence.
But they&#39;re a threat
and we need to have
Wow, Space Force!
And they get into this thing
and the national security state,
and they&#39;re completely at the mercy
and the ones who are assigned
by definition, have been in
I did a video brief
and also for President Putin,
that the problem is,
they had already been, unfortunately,
had already taken policy steps
and what have you,
and then were were running
One thing is clear,
is that the normal
that you would think
Presidents aren&#39;t briefed in on this,
heads of the Defense
who aren&#39;t brief on this--
From talking to them, it&#39;s clear
So there&#39;s some other structure.
I happen to be persuaded
that immediately after Roswell,
when they recovered a craft
that the Truman administration
of the normal constitutional framework
and it was made up
people they viewed
A shadowy government
its own navy,
and the ability to pursue
free from all checks and balances
and free from the law itself.
It&#39;s sort of a shadow government
not just in the United States
And the kind of power they have,
both financially, technologically,
and the means of projecting power militarily,
is much greater than anything
or the conventional government
or the president of the United States has.
Eisenhower knew it,
and by the time he left office,
In the councils of government,
we must guard against
whether sought or unsought,
by the military-industrial complex.
The ETs actually had reached out
near what&#39;s now
and really wanted us to stop
with these nuclear weapons
and advance in a positive way into space
and become part of
which would have been
wonderful for the cosmos.
But the people who make
and a lot of control of the populace
so they circled their limousines
who would have been
and that included Eisenhower.
We must also be alert
that public policy
of a scientific technological elite.
The fascist element that is
in the major corporations,
especially the oil corporations
and the pharmaceutical industry,
the railroads, the shipping lines,
virtually all these people are fascists.
All during the robber baron era,
they laid claim to those areas
and they&#39;ve never relinquished them.
Those families
became the foundation
military and intelligence
They knew that after we had
there were ET crafts seen all over,
wherever we were doing experimentation
or even research and development.
The ETs were very concerned about that
So the military-industrial complex,
became very powerful
covert, unacknowledged
that eventually moved the president
and pushed Eisenhower
I tell people that that was the era
Fascism isn&#39;t, you know,
and six-league boots
strutting around in Nazi uniforms.
A fascist is a person who believes
the economic resources of the planet
and to distribute them among people
is to get a hold of them and have
to these strategic raw materials
and have the corporations
to these strategic raw materials,
and to be able to put them
that they paid for
and producing these products
and they believe that
to have their economy function,
so that the instrumentalities
are put at the disposal
of the corporations.
That&#39;s exactly what was
The Krupps and the ball-bearing factories
all those big, huge corporations
they were all privately owned.
In fact, they were financed
in giving the loans
to build them back up.
Andrew Mellon had intimate dealings
who was Hitler&#39;s private banker.
So did Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.
I mean, this is dirty, nasty history.
Oh, invest in Nazi Germany!
Hitler&#39;s a great guy,
Don&#39;t worry about it,
Standard Oil,
all during the war.
I mean, business thrives during war,
That whole concept of fascism,
it&#39;s a word that gets totally misused,
because people somehow conflate it
But it&#39;s a very narrow definition,
and it&#39;s an accurate definition
that the Central Intelligence Agency
actually promulgating the private interests
and they were putting at the disposal
all the instrumentalities
most importantly, the military
and their covert operations.
We&#39;re keeping the oil,
We left troops behind only for the oil.
Because they basically believed
is good for America.
It was an entire theory
So they viewed anybody
as an enemy of the United States.
So that&#39;s how the national security state
So that when they encounter
where this extraordinary technology crashes,
they realize that there&#39;s
that&#39;s got this technology that is
their instantaneous response to that was,
and then we&#39;ll have it,
this overwhelming advantage
that are threatening
or our what they called
was their actual term that they used.
My granddad and I,
I&#39;ll never forget it.
He said--he was talking about Patton,
&quot;I was in Czechoslovakia with Patton
and I thought, oh, that was neat,
And he&#39;s like, &quot;Well, you know,
a lot of the stuff that the SS had,&quot;
and I said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s interesting.&quot;
And he said, &quot;Well,
and there were all these exotic
parts of the V-2 and maybe a V-3,
And I said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s interesting.&quot;
He says, &quot;I saw a disc-shaped aircraft.&quot;
I said, &quot;Oh. Is that the one they built
and the Arado ones in a circle,
and everything like that,
&quot;No.&quot;
And that was it.
And so, they began to take this in
to be this huge national
because other than the nuclear bomb,
it was the ultimate potential weapon.
So they wanted to be able to use it
That fascism,
of these big industrials
they know they really can&#39;t control
unless they first control their minds
and their attitudes.
As Nazi war criminal Hermann Göring said
&quot;The people can always be brought
This is easy.
All you have to do is tell them
and denounce the pacifists
and exposing the country to danger.
It works the same in any country.&quot;
The buffoonery of the Third Reich
and they learned that
wouldn&#39;t be effective,
so they went subterranean,
People don&#39;t understand.
We won the battle of World War II.
We did not win that war.
(dramatic music)
My name is Paola Harris.
I&#39;m an international
in the area of UFOs.
I&#39;ve been working in this field since 1979.
When I was living in Italy,
I was reading in a journal
they called them Indian boys,
had been present at a crash
And I was wondering why
ever followed up on that.
So when I came to the United States,
destiny had it that I was able to locate
He told me in detail
these two little boys,
There was an object
that was shaped like an avocado.
And what interested me most,
because I look at the timing,
is it was exactly one month
and the atomic bomb was July 16, 1945.
Five, four, three, two, one.
(explosion rumbling)
And they actually went up to the crash site
They were tall and thin,
They had said they looked like
One of the witnesses said
because they were screaming
and the witness was nine years old,
so he wanted to go in
I had these...
these feelings that were being projected
through my mind.
I could...
I could feel what they were feeling:
pain, anxiety,
they were lost,
and I could feel that.
And I could see all kinds of pictures
that, to this day, I have not been able
So why it&#39;s important
it happened August 16, 1945,
and from that area,
we had exploded the atomic bomb.
So, I thought, well, let me go there,
and for five years
and realized that whatever happened
was a statement to the planet.
It was a statement about our going
and it was a statement that meant,
because whatever you guys did
is going to affect you for the rest
Assuming they&#39;ve always been there,
but what caused this great interest in us,
this large incursion after &#39;47?
Obviously we have to ask that.
If you accept the multidimensional theory,
it&#39;s highly likely that we&#39;ve done
in somebody else&#39;s world
and probably we&#39;ve done more damage there
We kicked a hornets&#39; nest
because we actually were doing more damage
than we were doing here.
Step in the shoes
who&#39;s tied into a civilization
and you are observing
a hundred years or so,
we&#39;re going from guns
and maybe cannons
to thermonuclear weapons,
then into the Space Age,
then these clandestine and covert
develop weapon systems
and then beginning to put them
and on ships and on land-based systems.
So, the ETs are sitting back
and now we&#39;re decades into the solutions
decades into the ability
that would be just
we could be out in space peacefully,
we&#39;re decades to when
the war to end all wars
What have we done?
Now they want to launch the big one,
this final card Wernher von Braun spoke of,
interplanetary war,
So, these civilizations
And at the same time,
like atomic and nuclear
that disrupt the fabric of the universe
and their worlds are affected.
We knew the world would not be the same.
(ominous music)
A few people laughed.
♪
A few people cried.
Most people were silent.
♪
I remembered the line
&quot;Now I am become death,
♪
I suppose we all thought that
&quot;I am death, the destroyer of worlds,&quot; plural.
Worlds, plural, is not just this planet.
So, it got to me that
that they were having UFO visitations,
that someone was interested,
and I had in my possession already
that are on Ryan Wood&#39;s website.
A letter from Robert Oppenheimer
addressed to President Truman.
It&#39;s called &quot;Relationships with Celestrial,&quot;
When you say relationships
and you are calling whoever
you&#39;re not really talking about
what you&#39;re talking about is more integration.
So, that whole document said,
Do we communicate with them
And if so, the United Nations
In the document, it says
These are the words of Einstein
Who can deal with this problem?
♪
The ETs have done a number of things
when we go too far where they stop it.
They don&#39;t do anything hostile or violent back.
They&#39;ve made it quite clear
where the ETs do not want humans
A couple of nuclear weapons
were destroyed by the extraterrestrials.
The one incident, for example,
following the missile
and shining a beam on it
And that is their major concern,
is to preserve the integrity of the Earth
because it affects their own system.
The very end of the &#39;70s
we attempted to put a nuclear weapon
for scientific measurements
which was not acceptable
And what happened?
They destroyed the weapon
The idea of any explosion in space
by any Earth government
was not acceptable
and that has been
And what&#39;s the consequence--
how is that demonstrated?
By the destruction of any nuclear weapon
If they were hostile,
they would have just
They don&#39;t.
I find out that is not the way they operate.
They warn.
They say, &quot;What the heck are you doing
And you have a choice,
We can listen
or we can let it happen.
(introspective music)
If people are watching the media right now,
they&#39;re not hearing about
What they&#39;re seeing
are released, supposedly leaked documents,
much of which is not even true.
They&#39;re not real, it&#39;s faked right there,
and it&#39;s being presented
that is to cause fear,
to make us see the crafts
There&#39;s no question whatsoever
that the elite that are in charge
both the official infrastructure
are, in fact, not only fascistic
but they&#39;re racist.
I&#39;m telling you, when you see
inside the Third Reich
and the courses that they were teaching
at the thing called the Ordensburgen.
The Ordensburgen was this series
where they trained the SS people
and you get access to their documents
where they&#39;re talking about
why is it that they hate the Jewish people
and people don&#39;t have any idea.
People got some
mainly because we allied
immediately after World War II
that they suppressed
so people don&#39;t really know the details
But the bottom line is,
runs extremely, profoundly deep
that owns most of the stock
and are the promulgators
And these are the people
of the UFO program
Many people who would consider
fall into these camps of,
and the bad aliens,&quot;
and the good aliens almost always
and the bad ones have different features
I&#39;m going, &quot;This is racism.&quot;
Just call it out what it is,
extrapolated into an interspecies level.
Not just racism
You know, which is even deeper.
We have to try to overcome this,
we have to train ourselves.
They&#39;re hoping that we, as humans,
evolve out of this mindset
and not go down the path
and extrapolate into space,
the racist world we&#39;ve had.
I call it exo-racism.
Justification for war
always begins with dehumanization
For example, as part of their anti-Semitic
the Nazis revived
the allegation that Jews murder non-Jews,
in order to obtain blood
In order to lay the foundation
the national security state
in a similar propaganda campaign
a cosmic blood libel.
The national security state apparatus
have been flogging that particular theory
that these extraterrestrial civilizations
are all here to eat us
or to take over our planet
You know, I mean, there&#39;s a whole scenario
on the part of authoritarian warrior states
about the ultimate other, the Hun.
Ninety-five percent of all of the movies
that have ever been made
have portrayed them as hostile
and it sells in that way.
I don&#39;t know why people watch those movies,
and I don&#39;t know why people
When Unacknowledged went viral
and got hundreds of millions
within months, they stood up to TTSA
who is a famous disinformation operative
at least amongst intelligence officials
and others who are well known
within the UFO subject.
That began the whole process
&quot;Gee, we don&#39;t know what these are,
but here&#39;s the evidence
which wasn&#39;t a leak,
and then they hit the button
that will take dictation
begins to cover it
and every network around the world.
Whereas, the Disclosure Project
has 100 times more direct military witnesses
and they wouldn&#39;t touch it
because it doesn&#39;t have
of the human race.
-Correct.
This is deadly serious,
Right.
I know, from direct conversations
that they know that the major military authorities
with whom they&#39;ve had
realize that if, in fact, the extraterrestrials
they could have done anything
They can come and go
So, in that regard,
they do not constitute
to our national security.
But they also know
that they&#39;re in the habit
for all of their entire organizations, et cetera,
by flogging a threat.
And so, they&#39;re inclined to do that
because the simple fact is
They think the people in Congress
in that they, in fact,
that they have to scare them.
And so they say, &quot;Well, if we&#39;re going
having hearings about the UFO issue,
we&#39;re going to have to tell our people that,
&#39;Oh, they&#39;re a potential threat to us.&#39;&quot;
And so therefore, they&#39;re conning
and then they are getting conned
because they don&#39;t trust them either.
And this is a question of integrity.
As long as people are not trusting each other
and they&#39;re conning each other,
this is dangerous.
This is how wars start,
this is how people
of what&#39;s going on here.
Those of us in the CE5 community, et cetera,
need to establish some kind of level
with Lu Elizondo
All they have to do is know
to know that what they&#39;re saying publically
We have to be able to establish
if we&#39;re going to establish
with an entire extraterrestrial civilization.
And so that we can&#39;t just degenerate
into the same kind of
that we&#39;re afraid of.
The facts about UFOs
That you discredit yourself simply
especially when it comes to
Perhaps the most devastating aspect
is the hoaxing of alien abductions
in order to create a culture of fear
Dozens of insiders
but it wasn&#39;t until 2016
that I was able to get one of them
We did do that, yes.
OSI did that.
There was a special group out of
that came out and did that.
They had these people
anatomical defects,
into thinking they were aliens, yeah.
I can&#39;t give you any specifics
because it&#39;s still--
and they probably are still doing it.
I wouldn&#39;t doubt it
These civilians got onto the base
and got into something
and they saw something
and this group came out
and scared the dickens out of them.
-Staged an alien event?
We have these technologies,
they are being used in false flag operations
where they hoax events,
and the purpose for all of that
is a sort of psychological warfare,
as it says in the CIA document I have
the UFO subject is very valuable
And that is a very interesting thing
What does that really mean?
Well, it means that the long-term defense strategy
from the late &#39;40s and &#39;50s forward
was informed by eventually
to consolidate sort of a global
of the population.
Could it be manipulated purposely
who have the technology
And people say, &quot;Well, of course not,
Well, I would remind you
during the Watergate investigation,
it was discovered that there was a plan
originated in the White House
to surface a submarine
and paint the second coming of Christ
using holograms.
Which is well within our technology today.
The idea was that since there
they would be so upset
that this would saturate
you know, the telephone system in Cuba
long enough
How interesting, I never heard of that.
Well, I think that&#39;s a classic
but that kind of manipulation
and I have personally investigated
where there was, in fact--
my conclusion, the conclusion of scientists
was that there was, in fact,
and that it was not a hoax
but a hoax on the part of somebody
In Vallée&#39;s book, Forbidden Science 4,
he describes a smoking gun document
that confirms what Doty said.
In an entry dated Thursday, 26 of March, 1992,
&quot;I have secured a document
confirming that the CIA simulated
as psychological warfare experiments.&quot;
We reached out to Dr. Vallée
and asked him if we could
He refused
and tried to blame the producers
for his decision to not release it.
Unfortunately,
have similar evidence
but are afraid to come forward publically.
This lack of courage or integrity, or both,
is precisely why the secrecy persists.
I also asked Richard Doty
using the military lingo for false flag,
which stands for
Yes.
That&#39;s pretty hush.
I don&#39;t think I should talk about that, yeah.
That is...
Yeah, that&#39;s very sensitive.
-Yeah, it&#39;s very sensitive, yeah.
-Extremely?
So, we&#39;ll just pass that question on.
(eerie music)
Colonel Corso was given the job
in research and development
but the foreign technology&#39;s
I mean, it&#39;s so foreign
And he explained to me that
in which he had fiberoptics,
he named the things physically
He knew they came from
or extraterrestrial materials
And it was his job
to be back engineered.
Now, in Colonel Corso&#39;s time,
but this had been done way before 1960.
These were extraterrestrial artifacts
that had to go into industry.
So, for the first time in my naive years
I realized why this secret was secret.
I always thought it was about, you know,
and the religions would fall
and I had no idea this was going on.
And ever since
I realized what this is about.
What this is about is the toys,
the artifacts,
and it&#39;s really about the industry.
It is not about whether people
I think that the younger population
and people that have studied this know
I mean, if they&#39;re not going to bomb you
during the time you&#39;re doing
I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to decide
and bomb everybody
There are too many times
where we could have had
and we never have,
and we&#39;re the enemy.
Hey, John, happy birthday.
There&#39;s no way that I can sugarcoat this.
I was talking to a gentleman
and he contends the Pentagon
so I just wanted to run this past you.
Does DoD have these things,
Jeff...
the UAP Task Force is really designed
to take a look at these
to try to help us get
Again, I&#39;m not going to get ahead
that the DNI will submit
that we are helping, obviously,
I&#39;ll just leave it at that, Jeff.
This exchange would have been
And notice that he didn&#39;t deny it.
There are three major lies
of the current false flag disclosure
The only threat to national security
is the unacknowledged projects
and other technologies
Period.
And yet, we are inundated with messages
about the threat to national security
We take all incursions
So, I mean, like everybody else here
certainly we are taking
regarding the potential for safety,
for safety concerns.
One of the most brilliantly subtle
currently being deployed
is this air of phony agnosticism
that has been generated
Do you believe that they sincerely
what these things are
They don&#39;t.
the greatest intelligence agencies,
these are true unknowns
and they were swarming our military arsenals.
They&#39;re seen over nuclear facilities.
This is documented.
We need to find out
There&#39;s a certain studied agnosticism
to come out through
for example, Nick Pope.
I mean, we are under siege.
It&#39;s like there&#39;s a war
and if this was drones
there would be
and, yet, the situation we&#39;re in,
and they might even be
so I agree with Luis Elizondo on this.
This is a potential
The same thing with people
Whether he&#39;s been paid or not,
&quot;Well, we don&#39;t know what these are.
There is a vital national security issue,
is being violated
Chris and I have met,
I think the TTSA program was
This is a mechanism to change
You&#39;re going to see us
us meeting with the intelligence services
and everyone is coming
&quot;This is real, we got
and it very well could be a threat,

In reality, this was

the former head of covert
All of a sudden, the same media outlets
started fawning over DeLonge
and always with the specter
Hal Puthoff was soliciting me for funds
which I think the Navy
So there&#39;s a lot
And of course, they&#39;ve left
and I don&#39;t blame them.
I think it&#39;s a shitshow
and some type of CIA
And I don&#39;t think anybody
And when they say,
&quot;This is a mystery we need
because you and I know
has reams of information
where it&#39;s from,
what they&#39;re up to,
It&#39;s just been going on
The military-industrial complex
and neither are the branches
They know exactly
I think Chris means well,
I don&#39;t think he&#39;s one of these guys,
&quot;I&#39;m going to fool the public
He doesn&#39;t need the money,
we don&#39;t need fame and money.
That&#39;s the last thing
And, of course, TTSA even had
who said, &quot;We need
because we don&#39;t know
In 1984, I got my chance
I&#39;m working on things
Meanwhile,
that was written to Ben Rich,
and the person writing

And Ben Rich writes back,
He acknowledges that they are

This is the head

was military aerospace
who was Rich&#39;s pen pal
I met Mr. Goodall
at the 20th anniversary
which we celebrated
He was dying
This is the mid-&#39;90s.
He&#39;d already retired
And I tracked him down,
near the end of his life.
And we were talking about John Andrews
and we started talking
And he said, &quot;Jim,
that&#39;s 50 years beyond what you,&quot;
&quot;beyond what you can imagine.
And if you&#39;ve seen movies
we&#39;ve been there, done that,
I said, &quot;Ben, you want
And typical Ben response

The first time I realized that some of
was when I met aerospace
who testified at the Disclosure Project
about a highly classified air show
where reverse-engineered
for those with a &quot;need to know.&quot;
A male staff member
not only confirmed the exhibit,
but the fact that there were
These discs were hovering off the floor
They were referred to
also nicknamed &quot;the flux liner&quot;
This is a diagram that I made
based on a sketch
that Brad Sorensen
shortly after he had his sighting
and subsequently cleaned that drawing up
And that&#39;s the drawing
Later on, I obtained

by a military pilot,

This particular vehicle
in all proportions and respects in terms

of unlocking
which would unleash
But, suddenly, the articles stop
This is the point where we crack
and it went totally covert.
And this Tic Tac, the word is
it&#39;s the successor
Elizondo just will talk
He goes in circles,
I&#39;d love to get into a debate
that&#39;s never going to happen.
Well, this is a document
through the Freedom
and it demonstrates quite clearly
if you will, these UAPs
for at least 70 years,
and this is official
This isn&#39;t some eyewitness report
This is official
from military personnel
And what it says is,
&quot;Look, we&#39;ve had a lot of military
to include special agents
and all of them
and more importantly,
on a regular
over sensitive U.S. military facilities.&quot;
And this has been occurring,
The U.S. government
that this is not some sort
Quite the contrary.
Over the years, dozens of defense
have briefed me on what
at places like
going back to
Many of these man-made aircraft had been
and become part
indistinguishable
These rogue, covert operations
staged thousands of sightings,
and disturbing encounters
knowing these incidents
This confusion between what is

that would be blamed on aliens.
This is from 1983,
Many, many witnesses
and, underneath,
you could see superstructure
That is not extraterrestrial.
Now, have there been
of boomerang
But where do you think
And, also, how else
You have to create structures
that would be believably
Some of them
They&#39;ll have some conventional
and they all have structural--
that are clearly
not an interstellar vehicle.
This is 1989 in Belgium that you see
Again, this is global.
These are also
You can basically, once you get
that causes mass cancellation,
you can create any kind
And it doesn&#39;t matter
because the way it moves,
the molecules of air around it,
in an electromagnetic field effect
so there&#39;s no resistance
That&#39;s man-made,
This one is great because it has--
there are the girders
And the people under it can see that
and the three on the...
That is man-made.
There are extraterrestrial vehicles
and there are saucer-shaped,
So to make things
how are you going to know?
Well, you got to be
And if you can&#39;t see
you&#39;re not going to know
This is from southern Illinois in 2000.
They went from
by clandestine human organizations
to these who were doing
But, of course, they wanted
that aliens were doing
No, it wasn&#39;t.
Which ones are man-made,
Dr. Greer is figuring this out.
We&#39;ve got to listen
These are facts.
This is not rhetoric.
And, then, we&#39;ve got
We&#39;re taught to be afraid,
We&#39;re taught to fear
Really, get over it.
Meanwhile, you have people
going on Fox News
&quot;We don&#39;t really know
It&#39;s a big mystery.&quot;
They&#39;ve lied by omission.
And when they say
Okay? I&#39;m sorry,
I&#39;m not on board with that,
But they have to know that&#39;s a lie.
Right. So they do,
So, you know, that&#39;s why I&#39;m giving
I mean, I&#39;ve had enough of that.
I had enough with my dad.
You know, was he a liaison
Probably. He probably had
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the rest of it,
&quot;Okay, yes, sir.&quot;
You know, and Chris
So, those people are
who act like, &quot;We don&#39;t know,
and that&#39;s why
If they were actually to say,
here&#39;s what they&#39;re doing,
which is what
they would be banned
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever
who has seen more

Has there ever been
a confirmed
We&#39;d have to say no.
We&#39;d have to say what&#39;s confirmed
let&#39;s call it a ship or an object,
We can just say what it isn&#39;t.
And, you know, you can ask yourself,
And of course, what we call

In the axis of disinformation,
Leslie Kean is the original
Over two decades ago,
in the planning and execution
and then betrayed our trust
by hijacking our top-secret

leaving the National Press Club Building
Leslie was there and she knew
so she adopted
so that every door to mainstream
Anything that can operate

that can have near misses

After receiving
Senator Marco Rubio
This past December, while he was still
he asked the Director
to present Congress
We&#39;ve gone this way before.
There have been
Gerald Ford, when he was congressman,
The whole window dressing
and then that was just really
And most recently, the $22 million
on this Bigelow Aerospace study.
I had a Zoom meeting this summer
the chief advisor
and they authorized this funding.
After spending $110 million,
because it was
where&#39;s the beef,
That money went to Robert Bigelow,
And he&#39;s a buddy
Right, he was chair
UFO proponent, thinks they&#39;ve
Right, so, you know, you&#39;ve spent
gathering information
outside of collecting
The people in that circle around
were all operatives of these
They made sure that those $22 million
putting the money in
And, so, what General Herbert said to me
and the Senate-classified SCIF,
secure communication
all they got was
he was an Army pilot--
And I said, &quot;Yes, that is what was done
And so there was a pretty sizable
What did they find?
Well, I mean, basically,
is a lot of different research
to try to understand the physics
you know, move around,
and then to just keep records
But they haven&#39;t been able
where they&#39;re from,
And I said, &quot;Do you feel
He said, &quot;Oh, yeah, a lot,
Ultimately, the reason
is that he and others realized
they were being deceived
It remains to be seen
out of this mandatory
and also Naval Intelligence Report
I think that the more
it could be even
because I think they will
that they will spin as evidence
and that&#39;s what&#39;s been
So, my concern is we need
and release to the public
with the evidence
so that people at least ask
&quot;Is that report full and accurate,
I think we need
If it&#39;s coming out of the U.S. government
and the mainstream media,
it is cherry-picked information
because they&#39;ve hit the button,
to cover it in a very specific way
that does not redound
When Brown gave me the idea
and it should have
well, we did for a while,
but in the Congress it didn&#39;t work,
So I went international,
and international is where
that was really willing to create
to prevent the placement
The beauty of having these Russian generals
is that we&#39;ve had a lot of like Colonel Corso
now we have these
and we need
where they unshackle their leaders
and speak the truth
Now if you listen to a lot
&quot;Oh, there are already weapons
but the fact is, if anyone reads this treaty,
it&#39;s on PeaceInSpace.com,
And it does tap people
CE5 events where people can
What more do we need?
Well, if you&#39;re listening
that&#39;s been taught to most of us,
that is ridiculous.
What about the people like me,
What about them
The courage that it takes to do this,
(soft music)
There is another path.
Just outside
of that black hole
is the path I&#39;ve spent my whole life
It&#39;s the path that leads
and the realization
that, to us,
This is the path of truthful disclosure
with our brothers and sisters
CE5, or close encounters
is a set of protocols
to initiate peaceful contact
It&#39;s easy enough
and it will absolutely
Millions of people
by connecting
or by downloading
in the CE5 Contact app.
Doing that in the context
of meriting citizenship
in a galactic civilization
is a very meaningful meme.
We need to work on ourselves,
we need to hearken to the higher angels
That&#39;s all a dynamic
That&#39;s why I think the CE5 thing
because, you know,
not to be speculating, you know,
about what
We really have to have
The more, the better.
That dual role of elevating
in rising to the highest levels
of our own human nature
and reaching out to establish
with the extraterrestrial beings
the two pathways
And in dealing with
we just have to take whatever steps
to impose treaties
like militarizing space
and all that kind of stuff.
That&#39;s another third leg of the stool
to exercise whatever kind of control
And that, I think, is the only way
world peace should&#39;ve happened
we have to have
At this point,
We&#39;re already in
we&#39;re already in a cosmic time,
so we have to have
And universal peace comes from
and from within,
this state of universal
As we wrap up this film,
we are seeing the threat narrative
Language like, &quot;We need to stop
seems to confirm
that CE5 would be blamed
Do not believe this lie.
This isn&#39;t entertainment.
This is our survival.
I saw that Dr. Greer
until he took his last breath
This is not about us, it&#39;s not about,
There is no money
It&#39;s about finding a group of people
But the most beautiful vision he has,
and I&#39;ve attended
is that he has found a way,
to communicate
because whoever is out there
So that, for me,
The CE5 protocols
is going to make
