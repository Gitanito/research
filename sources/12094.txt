I later found out that during the surgery my body started to 'shut down'.

My experience was that I was in the dark, lying down, but I felt very comfortable. I was experiencing total comfort and not afraid in any way. A figure walked in (although dark, I could see him). He was someone that I had known as an acquaintance all my life and about the age, my father would have been. This person had passed away several years ago. He sat down beside me, not facing me, reached for and held my hand. After some time, he tugged on my hand and I said, 'I am not ready to go with you.' He very gently placed my hand back by my side, and walked into the darkness very slowly. He never said a word nor did he turn his face to me, but I knew him.

After he left, I remember nothing until I woke up the next day on the ventilator.
