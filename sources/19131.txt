my name isn&#39;t Tom Bearden Lieutenant
Colonel US Army retired spent 20 years
little more than that in the active
military mostly in air defense
various other assignments filled artery
you know technical intelligence
assignment liaison to Canada to some
technical work going on site in
turbulent wakes and reentry systems and
so forth at the Canadian armament
research and development establishment
and spent quite a number of tours in in
basically Rd work
in the military developing missile
systems and things like that
for about 20 years or more some
associates and I have been researching
very heavily into trying to extract
electromagnetic energy from the vacuum
now we did so under somewhat duress
because the conventional electrodynamics
model does not allow this to happen
in other words it doesn&#39;t allow you to
extract excess energy from the vacuum
and use that to power your load so it
doesn&#39;t allow you to make a self
powering system so we took the approach
that some of the phenomenology we had
seen in experiments and so forth
convinced us that it was possible and
there didn&#39;t seem to be any real
physical reason why it couldn&#39;t be
extracted if we could find the way to do
it but we had the problem of why doesn&#39;t
the electrodynamics allow it to be done
so at the same time we also began a
study of the foundations of electronics
in other words what are the fundamental
concepts that are assumed in the theory
where did they come from and how did
they get in there and that was turned
out to be very interesting and very
pertinent because electrodynamics kept
getting modified and restricted is what
kept happening to it the original theory
that Maxwell had was 20 equations and 20
unknowns quaternion type equations what
we&#39;ve done is the closed current loop
circuit where all the carriers have the
same mass per charge ratio all the
buckets have the same weight so to speak
anytime you build a circuit like that
it&#39;s quite easy to show that the amount
of energy of that circuit collects
when we do this free region and we do
increase its energy ever how much it
clicks it will then use precisely 50
percent of that to destroy the thing
that let it do that and it&#39;s really the
dipole the source dipole it will use
that to kill itself so to speak and have
no more excess energy the other half
will go out to the circuit and power the
loads and losses that means less than
1/2 gets to the load
well to restore that source dipole in
other words so we can get some more
energy into use
it costs just as much to restore it as
was used to destroy it so we&#39;ve got to
put in more than we can ever get out in
the load with such a squirrely circuit
and that&#39;s the only kind of circuit
we&#39;ve used in power systems since day
one we&#39;re still building them we&#39;re
still making power systems that
deliberately kill them so we pay the
power company to have a giant wrestling
match inside as generator and lose
that&#39;s really what we pay them for so
that doesn&#39;t seem to be the way to run a
railroad it would seem to be much more
ideal to freely change the energy of the
system play a little switching cost so
we get a switched over to the load and
dump it in a load and let it go let it
power the load and so you can do it so
the problem we ran into was that the
electrodynamics had actually been
modified to throw out the very kind of
systems that we had seen in our
experiments evidence that could be done
but violates the ordinary
electrodynamics and we can do it and not
violate conservation of energy we can do
it in a court with thermodynamics and we
can do it in a court with physics and
electro magnetics now this is absolutely
rigorous I don&#39;t care how many folks
want to check that it will hold up
it is rigorous so this was one thing we
established from the study of the
foundations of electro magnetics you are
permitted to have electromagnetic
systems to power themselves and their
load and you don&#39;t have to put in the
energy they take it from the vacuum the
active vac our engineers are taught to
throw away about 10 trillion times for a
typical average case as much energy as
they pull out of the vacuum without even
knowing it in a generator and a battery
and it&#39;s pouring out down the circuit
and misses the circuit they throw all
that away and only calculate a little
bit that we catch in that circuit and in
use now when we measure the circuit we
obviously measure the energy being
dissipated by the various pieces of that
circuit well if the energy is being
thrown out of there it had to get in
there
so obviously the measurements of the
circuit will match pointings theory
because it will match the energy that
actually when
there to get dissipated like the country
boy said you&#39;ve got a pipe here so to
speak and it&#39;s got some holes in it if
you measure all the water flowing out as
how much water come in it now your whole
River can be around it and missing the
pipe and you won&#39;t measure that so we
have built a whole science based on
throwing away this enormous energy that
is pulled out of the vacuum by every
little old separation of charges every
dipole well in the 50s in 1950s particle
physicists discovered wu and others
discovered broken symmetry they
discovered how fundamental a process
something like this dipole is where we
separate two opposite kinds of charges
and TD Li for example looked at it for
physical charges and so forth and Li won
a Nobel Prize for it any dipole is a
broken symmetry in the Furious exchange
with the vacuum is a broken
three-dimensional symmetry what does
this mean cutting through all the words
getting down to country boy language it
means that nature does not insist on
conserving energy in three dimensions we
do because we have a three-dimensional
mind we like to think in terms of space
because observation itself destroys time
and what we look at is special so we
like to think the world is made of space
not space time however nature loves to
work in four dimensions her fundamental
law is conservation of energy must apply
in four dimensions you&#39;re not going to
beat that one so never think about that
but there is no law of nature that
requires you to come in and say also it
must apply simultaneously in three
dimensions if we build some gadget that
makes it apply in three dimensions we
apply an extra constraint on what nature
will give us turning that around we go
around building things that insist on
having this three dimensional exchange
of energy we got to put it in in three
dimensions for whatever we get out and
lose some in the middle so we&#39;re we got
a terrible situation
all the way it&#39;s called entropy
engineering we always got entropy
beating us to death never go over unity
forget it lose a lot we talked about you
efficiencies at 30% and so forth for our
power systems when we talk about burning
the coal and all that stuff but nature
doesn&#39;t require you to do that all you
have to do is break a little bit of this
threesome symmetry set of chains where
you have tied her feet to the floor once
you break the flow in three dimensions
you no longer have to conserve energy in
three dimensions the basic conservation
of energy is an inflow from four
dimensions outflow in three dimensions
from the fourth dimension and converted
and flowed out into three and that one
is free giant Negi entropy is free
nature will start reorganizing a goodly
percentage of the whole vacuum for you
spreading it to speed of light and will
continue it as long as you leave to die
pool alone the original charges in
dipoles in original matter of the
universe have been putting out energy
and reorganizing the vacuum for 15
billion years
today we&#39;re said we can&#39;t engineer
negentropy when Nega entropy is the
easiest thing in the world spins in here
whereas entropy is the hard way to do it
and that&#39;s the way we all do it the
bottom line of this is if will initiate
a negative entropy and let it go it&#39;s
just like you punched a hole in the
ground and you got a big gusher of oil
you don&#39;t have to furnish the pressure
and you don&#39;t have to furnish the oil
here it comes and it comes out and real
all that you can use and the common
dipole in every electrical circuit pours
out energy in that fashion the problem
is not how to get enormous energy from
the vacuum that problem then totally
solved it was actually solved in 1903
had we understood it had we understood
what Whitaker wrote we didn&#39;t but now we
do understand it and we do certify a
very rigorously with some of the AIS
papers that that is for real the problem
now is how do we catch a goodly bit of
this energy and use it a symmetrical you
dump it in and load let it power that
load and not use half of it to go back
over and kill the little dipole so we
set about then to build one that wasn&#39;t
built that way
it
yes we have been successful we have just
built our second model the first model
produced five times out what we put in
we pay for switching go we don&#39;t put any
energy into it to actually power the
system it comes right out of a permanent
magnet the dye which is a dipole and the
reason for using a permanent magnet is
very simple you can pass the flux beta
in a flux channel back through the
permanent magnet and those poles don&#39;t
get destroyed they are welded into the
material when you magnetize it that&#39;s
not like little charges separated in an
electrical charge you knock the charges
out and destroy the dipole so we can
bypass one of the big problems with a
permanent magnet we don&#39;t have to
destroy the dipole that gives us one
solution going in the other is how do we
catch the energy well that turned out to
be fairly simple we found a material
which will separate the magnetic field
from what&#39;s called a magnetic vector
potential the vector potential flows
unceasingly from the magnet it&#39;ll flow
from now for the next 15 billion years
you can&#39;t slow it down you can&#39;t change
as long as that magnet is there so you
have plenty of energy flow the question
is how to use it so we use it by
diversion we reason that this flow will
replenish is like a river it&#39;s like a
humongous river if we dip some energy
out of it it&#39;ll replenish the hole we
dipped out of it to speed of light so
for all practical purposes instantly so
we can dip and dip and dip we have to
pay to switch to do that but we can keep
dipping and the water feels as fast as
we dip it then if we come down to
another area and we let the water that
was replenished still interact with
something and at the same time we dump
the water that we we dipped in there we
will have more energy by far than what
we&#39;re paying for dipping so we looked at
it as an energy flow process which it is
and we found the material which would do
part of the dipping for us it will
separate a magnetic field from the
magnetic vector potential yes there is a
history a long history of overunity
systems what does that mean the for
example nikola tesla had one basically
is big magnifying
former that he had in own Long Island
was such an over unity system the way
that one apparently worked is he got the
entire earth itself in resonance the
crust of the earth is you go down in
there it&#39;s made of highly nonlinear
materials particularly when you get down
to the perovskite or whatever you call
that stuff and it will act it in in the
bulk even it will interact in a sort of
a nonlinear optics fashion it will do
phase conjugation and so eventually what
it what it does is everything going on
is feeding energy into the earth starts
to feed energy into that way that he
created so he gets a lot more energy in
his resonant wave fed from outside from
the environment in the interior of the
earth and that&#39;s the way he built up a
humongous wave of energy his idea was
you could then put in a tap on it
anywhere else on the world and extract
it free and of course JP Morgan&#39;s take
on that was that&#39;s foolish you can&#39;t put
a meter on that actually doomed much of
Tesla&#39;s career at that point when Morgan
found out that he Tesla was going to
produce the energy freely small cost
here at a central location everybody
else could tap it for free
it wouldn&#39;t have powered the whole world
today it would have powered much of the
world in those days Tesla also were
pretty sure put a system in the car and
ran a car on it and the reason we were
pretty sure is his nephew who rode in
the car with him is still alive and can
describe the incident and how the engine
had no gas no input of power and would
still run once the Tesla got it started
and we know it&#39;s perfectly possible
Tesla apparently knew how to use this
giant negentropy process that&#39;s
universal every energy is free for the
taking from the vacuum anywhere you want
it we just have to learn to use that
some of the breakthroughs in the past
have been deliberately suppressed I will
name a few T Henry Moray was inspired of
course by Tesla&#39;s work and he
demonstrated so many times to so many
scientific and engineering groups and
people who were skilled in the art there
is absolutely no question that T Henry
Moray
a system that produced 50 about 50
kilowatts out of a 55 pound box
this is well-established as you go back
and look at all kind of certified tests
and everything else that he did there&#39;s
all kinds of skullduggery that happened
there I don&#39;t think - Henry Morley ever
got a decent chance to ever do anything
with that the Russians even tried to
kidnap him at one time it reads like a
James Bond movie
but it&#39;s real it really happened and it
really happened here in the United
States this was before the war it was in
the 1930s the same general period of
time one of the greatest electoral
magnetic fellows we ever had scientist
was gabriel crone gabriel crone invented
a true negative resistor working on a
Navy contract for standard University he
was never permitted to reveal the exact
way that he constructed his negative
resistor but I used direct quotes where
he in fact said we have a negative
resistor and we can disconnect a
generator from this Network analyzer
when we got negative resistors in there
because they will power the circuit so
that one was in fact suppressed I don&#39;t
know whatever happened to it but it
vanished and he never did reveal the
secret of what he called his open path
connecting any two points in a circuit
but it is in the literature and is well
documented because he was one of perhaps
the leading electrical scientists in the
United States at that time well there&#39;s
another one that went down the tube
various and sundry people have made
casual ones from time to time over the
years I&#39;d estimate probably 50 different
inventors have made casually invented
something even if they didn&#39;t understand
it they did get it to go over unity
we&#39;re never able to get anything done
with it most of the time they incurred a
lot of enmity from the scientific
community sometimes we&#39;re really hounded
and sometimes we&#39;re just very naive
sometimes very nice probably the best
documented scientifically overunity
system self-running self-powering
systems were developed by the Russians
before World War two
it&#39;s in the French scientific literature
and it&#39;s also in the Russian scientific
literature the papers are there I quote
them and many of the things that I
published and you can go check the
papers the theory is there many papers
are published on this in the Russian
scientific literature they built what we
call parametric oscillators they have an
oscillator going and they change in the
middle of they switch the actual
inductance or capacitance or both of the
things so it becomes a self oscillation
device and they reached you know goodly
power for that with those days of 1500
kilowatt devices there are many ways of
looking at the suppression that&#39;s
occurred in this area and certainly I do
not wish to talk about it myself and
I&#39;ve been a victim of quite a bit of
suppression so has any other legitimate
researcher in this area all I can do is
give you my ideas and from drawn from my
own experiences and what I think it is
and where I think it&#39;s coming from today
we don&#39;t have so much big kingdoms today
we have big economic programs big
economic countries are basically we have
cartels we have a whole set of cartels
in an area interlocking corporations and
behind this we have a few people who are
quite wealthy and who own most things
now the normal nature of the beast for
very powerful empires let&#39;s call that an
empire it&#39;s a corporate Empire a set of
corporations Empire is basically a
cartel historically as far back as you
want to go we&#39;ve had cartels anytime we
have a very powerful cartel or set of
people to control a lot of things that
resists any means of changing its inflow
of control and is inflow of funds and
money and its power
you know everybody&#39;s trying to be the
big monkey it&#39;s really as simple as that
and so the more powerful the agency the
more powerful the group and we&#39;ll
powerful the cartel the more they will
resort not only to legal means but to
extra legal means to suppress their
competition you know this is an open
known today for example the greatest
espionage in the world is industrial
espionage between one corporation and
another right here in America they&#39;re
the ones that hire all the spies and the
spooky equipment and everything like
that by far more than that Intel agents
do so that&#39;s one thing we have we have
the giant industrial or really cartel
economic cartels in energy and it&#39;s not
one cartels there are many many groups
in energy and each of those has become
very powerful in its own area and each
one does not wish to see simple little
electrical taps pulling out enormous
energy from the vacuum they would much
rather see you burning a lot more all
and so forth so yes there&#39;s a in my view
there is a very active suppression
effort by those kinds of folks part of
that goes into very unique areas they
don&#39;t do it so more so much it&#39;s not
totally mafia type stuff it&#39;s not like
you know you just flat get shot there&#39;s
some of that but one of the main reason
it is they take a deep psychological
profile of an individual that they wish
to suppress what it means is I really
wish to get him entangled in all kinds
of difficulties he can&#39;t get out of now
a good trait from a human being
standpoint may be a very valuable trait
to somebody who wishes to manipulate you
for example suppose you&#39;re easy to
approach that&#39;s a vulnerability that&#39;s a
serious vulnerability so one&#39;s deep
psychological profile is examined in
great depth by real experts and any way
that you can be gotten to where you now
if you don&#39;t have now who knows
International Finance you can be had on
a money laundering scheme easily and not
even recognized that&#39;s what you&#39;re in so
anyway that you do not have good
knowledge or you do not have ability or
you have a vulnerability they call them
vulnerabilities then they arrange
scenarios just like you would write a
movie in fact they do it with computers
all computerized and in this scenario we
have we write a play where this
particular vulnerability is going to be
exploited in the target now they keep
deep psychological profiles on lots of
useful fellows these are people who
basically have knee-jerk reactions or
something or their radical or they have
some kind of way they interact which if
could be connected with you would be in
the area we wish the interaction to
occur to get you off into something else
totally different what you&#39;re doing so
the next thing you know here all it
takes to set that up maybe a phone call
and stimulate the interaction to occur
and then the controllers sit back and
watch the game go it&#39;s gaming but it&#39;s
just like right watching a movie
scenario one of these days would
probably write a book on gaming and how
it&#39;s done and what kind of the main
games they can use but I can tell you
they&#39;re very effective you can get so
many different games from so many
different walks of life by so many
charming folks who are really oily
characters that you would not believe it
and those come at you in Mass and
usually they bury you they bury you off
in the courts they bury off they get you
tricked into doing an illegal act how
would they do that if you if you
wouldn&#39;t violate the law real simple how
can you be made to violate the law when
you&#39;re not a criminal simple let me give
you for instance fellow comes in and he
says you know we really need to get some
real major financing every inventors
poor everybody&#39;s struggling nobody&#39;s got
the money to build all these build ups
which may cost ten fifteen thousand
dollars twenty thousand apiece so
everybody&#39;s struggling for money so he
comes in and we&#39;re going to raise this
we&#39;re going to form a stock company
we&#39;re going to do all these good things
unbeknownst to you he goes off to the
Securities Exchange Commission and
several other people Treasury Department
he says hey I think I have fallen in
with a den of thieves of course he&#39;s the
CEO now understand because he&#39;s the guy
knows all this stuff and tell you what
I&#39;ll do if if you&#39;ll give me immunity to
prosecution I&#39;ll help you catch these
crooks because they&#39;re going to do the
greatest Monday laundering thing you
ever heard of it&#39;s going to come right
out one of these foreign countries is
going to be scrubbed and come in here to
fund this effort let&#39;s go
to be laundered dope money or something
like that you have no knowledge this is
happening and they give him they jump at
the chance they&#39;ll give him the immunity
to prosecution that&#39;s their normal modus
operandi they want to catch some crooks
and this guy is going to help him catch
some crooks so then he goes off and sets
all this up and keeps you deluded about
what&#39;s happening now you wind up in
where the thing is going to be
consummated somewhere and if you
consummate it you wind up behind bars
for about twenty years wondering how you
got there when you never did anything to
Monte launder anything he&#39;s the fellow
who did it and who set it up and he
testifies against you because he&#39;s
immune to prosecution this is one of the
standard games
Makaveli ax is not dead he still lives
and these are the games that are played
and is particularly played in the
systems where people are trying to build
overunity systems it&#39;s been very
effective in stopping some of them as do
you think weevil forces lethal force is
used I worked with an inventor for
example the Sparky sweet is quite well
known and he was shot at once with a
silenced rifle from about a sniper rifle
from about 300 yards the only thing
saved his life was he was an old guy and
very feeble there towards that part of
his life and he was stunned as he coming
up the steps and he fell down he just
Flint fell down on the steps caught his
foot and fell right forward and as his
head went forward the bullet went right
by where his head was and of course the
assassin was never found so there are
many cases like that some are killed I
believe Maranatha
I believe to be a kill I don&#39;t believe
Maranatha jumped off a building when it
was excited on the way to to talk about
his invention and so forth gave no
indications of it if I can believe the
reports of the people who visited where
his body lay where his body lay on the
pavement glowed and there&#39;s only one
weapon on earth that will kill a human
body and leave where it lay lies on the
cement let the cement blow under it and
that&#39;s a lot
Juvenal wave shooter what&#39;s called a
shooter so I believe my personal belief
I can&#39;t prove this in a court of law
don&#39;t intend to try but my personal
belief is that merinov was killed he was
probably killed by either the KGB or one
of their agents from one of the other
iron current Curtain countries killed
with a shooter and thrown off the
building to make it look like suicide
the police probably knew about it that&#39;s
why they let the body lay so long before
they moved it they didn&#39;t want to tangle
with the longitudinal waves from it so
yes there are some rather bizarre things
that have occurred to some people as I
say I prefer not to dwell on that try to
get by as much of that as we can and try
to dwell on the science the only way
we&#39;re ever going to beat all of this
stuff we have to convince the scientific
community that there&#39;s real science here
let me now review some of the
implications of what I hope is just now
emerging in these these energy systems
where we take the energy in the vacuum
turn it into normal electromagnetic
energy and we catch it and use it to
power our loads first of all every
system we&#39;ve gone out to has been doing
this we just didn&#39;t know it we thought
that generator powered a the external
circuit it doesn&#39;t it does not power it
at all all it does is we twist the crank
on the generator the shaft to turn the
shaft and that forms a magnetic field
inside the generator and that energy in
that magnetic field dissipates itself
upon the internal charges to force the
positive charges in one direction and
negative charge another to make that
dipole and that&#39;s all the generator does
doesn&#39;t add one watt to the power line
all the coal all the oil all the dams
ever built all the nuclear fuel rods
ever consumed never added one single
watt to the power line all they did was
keep rebuilding the dipole that we have
designed a silly circuit to destroy
faster with then we can power the loads
not the way to run a railroad so we have
polluted the planet we have just we&#39;re
killing species we&#39;re poisoning our own
lungs in our own environment we don&#39;t
have to do that but it&#39;s a giant set of
cartels it&#39;s a giant financial set of
Empires and it&#39;s going to continue this
way unless we get the attention of the
scientific
community focused on it and hopefully
get some legislative action focused to
force the action to develop these kinds
of systems now the implications once we
develop them and start to use them first
of all we don&#39;t have to have all this
nuclear look how expensive and how long
it takes to build a nuclear power plant
and then all the radioactive wastes you
have you know they still store the fuel
rods on the sites after they&#39;re spent
you know what to do with them so you&#39;ve
got all kinds of schemes about where
you&#39;re going to put them the blunt truth
is right now we store them on-site it&#39;s
just as a nuclear power plants I the
other thing is we don&#39;t need to pollute
with all these hydrocarbon byproducts we
don&#39;t need to pollute the whole
biosphere like that we don&#39;t have to
burn all that stuff just to make a
dipole quit destroying a dipole we don&#39;t
have to remake it so if we use the
system where we extract it from the
vacuum we can clean up this biosphere we
can also right now one of the greatest
critical things we have in my view the
supply of all is not lost but the supply
of cheap oil has now peaked we are there
what this means is we will continue to
get some all yes but it will be more and
more and more expensive year by year by
year meanwhile the demand for
electricity goes up everywhere in the
world which drives the oil curve again
and what you have is the classic
escalation of prices type situation the
demand is up the supply is down the
supply gets more and more expensive to
try to fill it and so the costs just
going to go up and up and they&#39;re not
going to stop well what happens
somewhere along the line of about 2008
the way I look at it and project it
we&#39;re going to have a world economic
collapse the economy cannot stand such
increases as is going to come up and god
help us if we have a war in the Mideast
nobody knows what maybe 2006 you know
instead of 2008 but I believe by 2008 we
will see the world economy collapse now
about a year before that as the
economies are crumbling not everything
runs up in like a square wave collapses
in one instant as they start to crumble
in distress on all these populations and
all these leaders and all these nations
are increases so much desperate people
will do anything desperate leaders
particularly phonetical leaders will do
anything what will happen is in their
client their conflicts will increase and
escalate and they will start to use the
weapons they have in those conflicts and
there&#39;s about 25 nations now according
to the Secretary of Defense coin that
have mass destruction weapons nuclear
weapons for example for goodness sake if
you don&#39;t have nukes maybe you bought
some suresh&#39;s plutonium look at what
will happen to your water supply in New
York City put a little plutonium in it
so all kinds of things people that are
poor nations that can&#39;t afford nukes
have biological weapons but about 25 and
it&#39;s growing all the time has weapons of
mass destructions now by the way those
weapons are already in our large
populations if you will check colonel
unos book colonel enough is the
highest-ranking GRU defector we ever had
and his books cleared by the CIA so what
I&#39;m saying is cleared Luna tells you how
the Russians introduced the nuclear
weapons surreptitiously into their
operatives on the ground and secreted
them in the US he tells you how it was
done in the book so read the book all
our big cities as far as I&#39;m concerned
in population centers already have
weapons of mass destruction hidden in
them we call it you call that Deadman
fusing and so all the nations have
Deadman fused one another one way or
another and all the old studies showed
that in a heightened tension great
conflicts and high tension whenever they
start popping the nuclear weapons or the
weapons of mass destruction you have a
very formidable thing that happens to
you nobody has defenses since we have no
defenses the only thing you have is like
a fencing duel you have to hit the enemy
before he hits you you have to destroy
him or you will be destroyed mutual
assured destruction is a funny acronym
the only thing that&#39;s debatable about it
is whether the destruction shall be
mutual or unit unitary what happens is
everybody fires on perception of
preparation by is
Cirie&#39;s and you have to fire everything
you have as fast as you can as rapidly
as you can as massively as you can to
try to destroy your enemy and otherwise
you have no chance of survival so what
we get is the great Armageddon
everybody&#39;s been dreading the energy
crisis going right now in my view will
probably evoke a great Armageddon that
we&#39;ve all feared so long in about 2007
if we don&#39;t solve the crisis we back up
from that it means the first quarter of
2004 these things had better be rolling
off of the assembly lines like sausages
or we can all forget it and go home it&#39;s
too late to change it
that&#39;s how short rations how short a
time we have in our shorter rations are
because of the what I view as the stress
that I view this is the greatest
strategic threat to survival of the
United States and in fact of
civilization itself that is ever existed
in my lifetime now the fools may blow
the world from other causes don&#39;t
misunderstand me but they&#39;re going to
blow it from this cause this I&#39;m quite
certain of in my own view so it means
that anything I can do to try to stop
that has to be done what we need is a
great Manhattan Project you can do it
this is a doable we have the principles
we know how to do the giant Negi entropy
we have good scientists we have some
sharp young grad students and postdocs
they aren&#39;t allowed to work on these
kinds of things for goodness sakes less
Marshall them together like we did in
World War two to get the atomic bomb
which we went from zilch you might say
in four years we had an operational bomb
let&#39;s do the same thing here because
survival depends on it not only of us
but a civilization there&#39;s even a little
evidence and I don&#39;t know really how to
to put this in perspective we had one
friend for example that we worked with
very closely who built practical
overunity systems he demonstrated at a
conference for for example an eight
kilowatt system and in very mysteriously
he and his whole family disappeared we
have found out since in fact not long
ago that he&#39;s still around but and he&#39;s
doing very well because he was attired
in a very expensive suit and very
nice automobile but he and his family
are okay even though they disappeared
back there but here was a successful
unit that just flat disappeared off the
face of the earth now I assume rightly
or wrongly it has to either be for the
great financial empire Sauron has to be
for some kind of black project that
somebody needed a power system that
would power itself in the load and they
classified it whatever it is I don&#39;t
know but whatever it is the survival of
humanity itself and civilization itself
is now at stake and I really believe
through the auspices of the US
government regardless of what that kind
of program in it anywhere may have we
must bring it forward to save ourselves
and save the earth if we don&#39;t we can
keep it secret or we can keep it in the
control group hands and we shall all go
down to oblivion in about 2007 if they
don&#39;t have a war in the Middle East or
something and do it in 2006 or 2005 I&#39;m
a co-author of a paper in the literature
way back there which reports a
successful anti-gravity tree I&#39;m not
going to do another experiment not even
going to participate in one it&#39;s not
going to so you know everybody&#39;s got a
little bit different circumstance and my
circumstance for me to go on living and
staying healthy and doing well depends
on me avoiding certain areas and that&#39;s
one of them but I can work in energy I
can even work in the medical area but
right now the medical won&#39;t do you any
good if we all go down the tube so
energy is is what needs doing
immediately deals with the scientific
community if you look at what the
scientific community is doing I&#39;m
speaking sadly but I&#39;m speaking bluntly
and truthfully if you will read the
literature you will find it&#39;s almost
business as usual they&#39;re not doing
anything that has any chance of stopping
this problem before the world explodes
in our faces
sure windmills are good burning the oil
a cleaner is good all of these things
building a couple of more dams is good
if you don&#39;t destroy it too much of the
biosphere etc etc building some
windmills is good
however that&#39;s a spit in the ocean it
doesn&#39;t solve the problem the problem is
just exactly like what we had in World
War two we have a problem it&#39;s a doable
it can be solved very quickly because
we&#39;ve got the first half of it already
solved how to get the energy on the
vacuum so half of it is already done but
we can&#39;t get the scientific community to
move on it to turn those young grad
students loose and and those young
postdocs loose the professor at the
University for goodness sakes is trapped
he&#39;s absolutely trapped all universities
are greedy they want to overhead money
he&#39;s got to bring in extra money he&#39;s
got to get patents and of course he&#39;s
got to get his papers published so he&#39;s
caught in a process where he must
compete for the packages which are put
together and come down for availability
to compete for if he doesn&#39;t get those
packages and win them he doesn&#39;t fund
his grad students he doesn&#39;t get the
overhead money he&#39;s going to be lucky if
he&#39;s working for the grocery store
instead of being a physicist so he&#39;s in
a mad scramble to try to fill and keep
running on a treadmill to meet the
conditions that&#39;s been laid down on him
and goodness sakes those packages
already prescribed all the research he&#39;s
going to do and his grad students are
going to do so we&#39;ve got the whole
scientific community working on the
wrong problem what you need work so what
could the youth going to do about what
we can do is do just like we did in
alternative medicine or really like the
Manhattan Project you can order the
scientific community to do it whether
they wish to do it or not and hold them
accountable from the highest level to
the bottom how much money are we
spending in our National Laboratories on
nuclear stuff don&#39;t we think at least
about 10% of that money ought to be
rooted out of there and spent on nothing
but this which might save us while the
other stuff takes us down the tube of
course we should
in fact it ought to be more than that
the best scientists we have the best
grad students the best postdocs ought to
be turned loose on this problem and that
means funded and that means that we do
not allow scientists to slander and
libel people
who are trying to do research in this
area right now they do it wholesale and
they do it at will now look at what they
call me in print for goodness sake
but the problem is the scientific
community resists change and it&#39;s doing
business as usual and my bottom line is
unless the legislative branch together
with the administration forces them to
get on this problem and solve it they
will not only fiddle while Rome burns
they will help burn it if only
alternative you have now of course since
at this moment as we speak the
government has not moved the scientific
community has not moved so that is a
fact as of this moment I&#39;m speaking I
hope that changes I&#39;m trying to change
it but right now that is a fact and
right now it&#39;s a fact they&#39;re not going
to move unless something happens to move
them and neither is the scientific
community failing that the only thing
left is the private industry and that&#39;s
a mixed bag first of all the moment you
try to do it in the private industry
then is when you are absolutely
vulnerable to all the games
for example lawsuit alone can hang you
to where you will never come out of it
for the next 15 years the lawsuit
doesn&#39;t have to be justified or anything
at all you can sue anybody for anything
if you&#39;ve got enough money to file the
suit and want to swear simple as that so
the other thing you have is you can
trigger anybody from anywhere for all
kinds of radicals to come out and say oh
you still used a coil of wire or you
used something over here you use some
semiconductor you stole my invention and
so the next thing you can be in court
for 20 years on that all of this comes
at you this is part of the delay this is
the group wanting to stay in power while
we all go down the tubes they operate
primarily in the private sector so
you&#39;re automatically in that arena where
the real liens are after you all the
time you&#39;re over there trying to find a
legitimate deal okay let&#39;s talk about
venture capital sometimes called vulture
capital but if you find a good one it&#39;s
not vulture is venture
what does the venture capitalists want
to do he wants to buy a 30% or 50% of
you come near 51 or maybe 60 he&#39;s got
the money the next thing he wants to do
is he&#39;s going to move you and all your
guys right out of there and he&#39;s going
to put his own management team in there
and he&#39;s going to write with bean
counters if you run this one with bean
counters only you destroy the program
before you start so your only choice
then is to avoid venture capitalists
like the plague and to try to go for
licensing which means the brunt of doing
the research on the front end falls on
you and your bigger resources which for
working people is whatever you can
afford out your back pocket but if you
don&#39;t do that you&#39;re not going to do it
anyway how many have you seen in the
past that went to venture capital route
that were real how many of them made it
I can name three or four that were real
they not there yet they&#39;re not going to
be there they were buried so the thing
that sets in you have to do it by
licensing then you got a skirt you got
to get the Patent Office the Patent
Office says it&#39;s impossible to do an
overunity system the API the physics
Institute you know comes down on you and
says oh it&#39;s absolutely against the laws
of nature it isn&#39;t you know these are
people who haven&#39;t even studied the
problem and they know classical
thermodynamics but it&#39;s against the laws
of nature to violate classical
thermodynamics of course it violates
classical thermal you can&#39;t build one of
these by classical thermal you build it
by the other kind of thermodynamics so
the next thing you have is the
scientific community is all over look
what they did the cold fusion there is
real stuff in cold fusion you know 600
experiments worked for goodness sake so
the thing is you&#39;re against the
scientific community is against you lock
stock and barrel and by the way
everything is a distribution curve get
off of this horse pucky about scientists
are always sweet nice reasonable people
that is not true
10% of them are Devils 10% of them are
angels ought to be rewarded at assault
of the earth but 10% of them have
absolutely no ethics absolutely playing
nothing but
the big monkey and power game and
absolutely your worst enemy in this area
glorious opportunity to in other words
the vultures or the there&#39;s a better
word for it the wolves go around looking
for the rabbits and you&#39;re the rabbit
and they&#39;re the wolf so your next thing
you get into is a big wolf get a wolf
rabbit game with the the scientists over
on that 10% so you can face all of that
meanwhile you&#39;ve got to go to the Patent
Office you get to the Patent Office what
are you looking at this is impossible
this is perpetual motion you say well
the atoms have been doing this for 15
billion years it&#39;s not perpetual motion
but it&#39;s just long-lasting but they call
it perpetual motion and of course there
is an unwritten law than anything is
perpetual motion shall not be even
proved too looked at you can&#39;t even get
a serious consideration in the Patent
Office I speak as one who has submitted
patents in this area I know what I&#39;m
talking about defended a couple of them
so what we have is a situation where the
entire structure of science industry the
organization&#39;s of science and the Patent
Office are already against you if you
can&#39;t get a patent how can you license
so it&#39;s a real neat little thing so
chicken and egg situation if I had the
chickens I could get some eggs if I had
the eggs I could get some chickens this
situation is designed so you never get
chickens and you never get eggs so the
only thing you can do is is to try to
put your head down and continue with
that and do one other thing
communication
fortunately we do have the Internet
Court sure it&#39;s full of lot of bad
information it&#39;s also full of a lot of
good information
you just have to discriminate so that
other thing you have to do to have any
chance at all is communicate communicate
communicate communicate which we do to
the limit that we&#39;re legally able to do
and not lose our patents if we can get
the government to move they can cut
through all of that by simply issuing in
order to do it and that&#39;s what it&#39;s
going to take we&#39;re going to struggle
with this other but I&#39;ll make you a
prediction if the government doesn&#39;t
move
there&#39;s a 75 to 80% chance we will fail
we certainly won&#39;t make the first
quarter of 2004 and if we miss the first
quarter of 2004 not just us there are
several other inventors and groups in
the same area and have systems at work
we are not the lone ranger here at all I
want every system out there that works
and real Gaunt going we need everything
we can do but if we don&#39;t make it by the
first quarter then we may as well all go
home and enjoy our families for the time
we have left because it&#39;s going to blow
it will be too little and too late and
don&#39;t come in in 2006 when any fool can
then see the world is fixing to blow up
and say would you guys like to try this
I&#39;ll say no I&#39;m going to enjoy my family
while the time I have left
you blew it back in 2000 2001 you
decided right then to blow it and so
it&#39;s on your head and that&#39;s will be all
we can do if we don&#39;t make the schedule
everybody wants a modern life they want
to get out of the mud and the slime and
everything and have lights and have you
know things that are powered and have
industry and jobs and homes and schools
is a common striving from the human
heart and to try to do that the way
we&#39;re doing it will destroy the planet
we will forcefully destroy each other it
seems to me we just ought to be wiser
than
funding from individuals of funding from
governments is necessary to get the
ideas out to get these people that are
thinking outside the box beyond oil to
begin to supply the ideas and to get the
scientists working on those ideas to
bring out all the problems that we have
with these technologies in a timely
manner instead of them sitting on the
fringes for long periods of time well or
some things in
