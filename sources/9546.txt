  		              		Experience Description   

    1. I was under general anesthesia for a dental operation and was sitting in a dental chair with my back to the door.  I saw my mother looking into a room that was next to the one where I was sitting.  She asked, 'So, is it over?' After I woke up, I asked my mother if this had happened. She confirmed that it had happened.  
  
  2. The second experience was also during anesthesia. I saw a brightly-lit room and people were standing over a table. I heard a loud, resounding voice that told me, 'Just don't forget to breathe!' This  roused me from the dream and I woke up. I  asked the doctors who had said this and it turned out that nobody had said it or heard anyone say it. And no one had been standing over me.
