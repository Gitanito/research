  		              		Experience Description   

    My now ex-husband was angry and held me against the wall by my neck with my feet in the air. He didn't realize he had strangled me to death.  When he released his hand, my body fell to the ground and my  head bounced off the concrete floor. He laid me on the couch and tried bring me back to life. When his attempts failed, he went to check on the children.

  I remember seeing the light and  then I moved through the wall. I was hovering over my family. At first I thought I was alive, but quickly realized I wasn't alive. I and fought to go back to my body. Then there was darkness until I awoke. 

My ex-husband said he was trying to figure out what to do with my body. 

  Since coming back, I'm stronger, smarter, and feel out of place. Just this year I entered a company entry level and now run all distribution operations over the country for an eight billion dollar a year industry. Seventy-five people report to me. I was a stay at home mom, with a waitressing history before I died. I'd say my death was a blessing. When I meditate, I can go back to the light. This  is frightening and feels like decades in just minutes, so I don't do it anymore. Life is an adventure.
