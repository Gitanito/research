INTRODUCTION
It would have been a real loss to all students of
mysticism and metaphysics if this little essay on
H. P. Blavatsky and The Secret Doctrine had not
found its way into print.
Max Heindel, the Christian mystic, pays homage
to Madame Blavatsky, the Oriental occultist. He
sees above the little differences which divide the
West from the East and rejoices in the great wisdom
which has flowed forth out of Asia, rendering fer-
tile the plains of the world's thought. Great is the
mind which rejoices in the greatness of other
minds. Max Heindel's tribute to the memory and
work of Blavatsky and her Masters is a truly beau-
tiful gesture in a world little given, alas, to such
gentle impulses.
We live a code of criticism and condemnation
with small appreciation of the works of others.
Sects and creeds build up walls about themselves,
and only heroic souls in whom spiritual perceptions
are truly awake can rise above these imaginary limi-
tations. Think back over the books that you have
9
10 INTRODUCTION
read and recall how seldom it is that any writer
speaks well of another. Each man, firm in his own
opinions, gives scant courtesy to the opinions of
others. There are many teachers in this world who
instruct with words, but only a few who instruct
with the noble example of generous deeds.
In his textbook of Christian metaphysics, The
Rosicrucian Cosmo Conception, Max Heindel refers
to Madame Blavatsky as "a faithful pupil of East-
ern Masters" and in the same paragraph he speaks
of her great book The Secret Doctrine as an "un-
excelled work." With his deep appreciation of
spiritual values Max Heindel was eminently quali-
fied to recognize the fundamental merit of Madame
Blavatsky's work. The Christian mystic is here re-
vealed as a sincere student of Oriental occultism.
His summary of The Secret Doctrine in the latter
part of this book reveals a remarkable grasp of the
outstanding principles of the monumental spiritual
traditions of Asia. In a few brief and simple words
Mr. Heindel sums up Cosmogenesis, the creation of
the world, and Anthropogenesis,. the creation of
man. Both Rosicrucians and Theosophists, in fact
all sincere students of the occult sciences, will bene-
fit from a consideration of this summary.
The manuscript of this present book may pro-
perly be considered as Max Heindel's first literary
INTRODUCTION 11
effort. It was the beginning of a considerable
metaphysical literature devoted to the application of
mystical idealism to the living problems of a sorefy
afflicted mankind. It has been written that "the
first shall be last." This little book brings into print
the only remaining unpublished manuscript of Max
Heindel. The manuscript originally consisted of
the notes of two lectures delivered before the Theo-
sophical Society in Los Angeles. In the years
which followed the preparation of these lectures
Max Heindel greatly increased his store of mystical
knowledge and has justly earned recognition as
America's foremost Christian mystic. His rever-
ence and respect for Madame Blavatsky in no way
altered, however, and to the day of his death he
always referred to her in terms of highest admira-
tion. It was through the writings of Blavatsky that
Max Heindel received in this life his first knowl-
edge of occult sciences. He recognized gratitude
to be the first law of occultism and his fine soul
preserved to the end a beautiful spirit of gratitude
for the inspiration and instruction he had gained
from the Secret Doctrine.
Both Madame Blavatsky and Mr. Heindel dedi-
cated their lives to the service of mankind. Each
was devoted to the dissemination of spiritual knowl-
edge. Both were rewarded for the most part by
12 INTRODUCTION
ingratitude, persecution and misunderstanding.
Both suffered from the falseness of friends and
learned how cruel the world can be to those who
seek to educate and improve it. Only the leader
of a spiritual movement can realize how heavy a
responsibility leadership can become. Madame
Blavatsky had already passed into the invisible
world before Max Heindel began his ministry. They
never met upon the physical plane. Though de-
nied personal acquaintance with the great Orien-
tal occultist, Max Heindel came to understand Bla-
vatsky through years of similar service to the same
high ideals. He came to understand her as only
a mystic can, and his appreciation of her loyalty
and her patience was deepened by the adversities
which he himself endured.
Both H.P. Blavatsky and Max Heindel gave their
lives in a beautiful service to th~ spiritual needs of
the race. Both went to early graves, broken by re-
sponsibility and persecution. Each has left as a
legacy to unborn generations a metaphysical litera-
ture which shall survive the vicissitudes of time.
The true purposes of mysticism are to perpetuate,
interpret and apply the idealism of the race. Men
tum to religion for guidance, encouragement and
solace. We want religion to stand back of us when
we try to live honest lives. We want to know that
INTRODUCTION 13
there exists somewhere in the world a body of
united people who are upholding spiritual values
in a world of crumbling material manifestations.
We are all seeking inspiration. We want ideals.
We want a worthy purpose to unite us in action.
We desire to establish in this vale of tears a spirit-
ual structure which shall be elevated above the hum-
drum. We want to go out into life recognizing
our spiritual institutions as oases in a desert of ma-
terialism.
Civilization is in the throes of a great reconstruc-
tion period. As never before in recorded history
men are seeking solutions to imminent and eminent
problems. Church and State alike are reaching out
to grasp something that is secure, something they
may cling to when the world they have known
passes into oblivion.
Jn all parts of the civilized world there are men
and women devoted to mystical interpretations of
life. These men and women are dedicated to a
code of spiritual ethics which has as its foundation
two great principles: the Fatherhood of God and
the Brotherhood of Man. These students are for
the most part organized into various groups large
and small for the express purpose of self-improve-
ment and social betterment. Such groups may be
classified under two headings: First, those whose
14 INTRODUCTION
inspiration is fundamentally Christian; and second,
those essentially Oriental. While these groups arc
divided, by emphasis, the fundamental purposes
which they seek to attain are identical, for all en-
lightened religious movements have as their chief
aim and purpose the regeneration of man, individ-
ual and collective.
Max Heindel was a pioneer in Christian mys-
ticism and Madame Blavatsky was a pioneer in
Oriental occultism. Both established systems of
thinking which spread rapidly throughout a soul-
hungry humanity. Not only did they leave organi-
zations of their own, but the seeds which they
planted in the hearts of men have sprouted forth
and borne fruit in many parts of the world, where
other organizations have been established along
similar lines. There is a considerable body there-
fore of mystics and occultists in America and their
number is increased each day by earnest men and
women whose hearts and minds are crying out for
some reasonable explanation for the changes which
are occurring in society.
Nearly all students of the occult sciences in Amer-
ica know the work which Madame Blavatsky and
Max Heindel have accomplished. The lives of
these two religious founders are a constant chal-
lenge to greater spiritual effort and more unselfish
INTRODUCTION 15
devotion. If we admire these great leaders we shall
desire to further their work by the intelligent per-
petuation of their doctrines through word and ac-
tion. During the period of the great World War
metaphysics lost a great opportunity to make a per-
manent contribution to the race by allowing itself
to be broken up by internal disruptions and con-
troversies. Organizations which should have been
dedicated to the unselfish service of mankind in-
stead wasted their energy in vain wranglings over
personal issues of little if any importance.
Our present crisis is far greater than the World
War. The whole civilized world is struggling
against selfishness and corruption. A new and
great opportunity is at hand for the application of
spiritual solutions to material problems. It is the
duty of all spiritually enlightened individuals and
all organizations of such individuals to forget all
differences, sacrifice all personal ambitions, and re-
dedicate themselves to the great ideals which
brought their various orders and societies into ex-
istence.
During the great boom period immediately pre-
ceding the present economic crisis even mystical
organizations were infected by the bacilli of wealth,
personal ambition and exploitation. Personalities
eclipsed principles and individuals and organiza-
16 INTRODUCTION
tions departed from those simple truths which are
the essentials of intelligent living. Then came the
collapse. Material values dropped like plummets
to an unfathomable depth. Ambitions were scat-
tered to Â·the winds and the race was confronted
with problems which can only be solved through
a restatement of spiritual values and a rededication
of men and organizations to principles of enlighten-
ment and truth.
Suppose this very day H. P. Blavatsky, the lion-
ess of the Theosophical Society, should return from
the Amenti of the wise, and should demand an
accounting from the members of the society she
had founded. Who could stand before her and say
honestly, "Beloved teacher, we have done our best,
we have remained true to you and the Masters for
whom you spoke." How many could say, "We
have been honest, kind, just and impersonal; we
have hewed true to the wisdom you gave us; we
have spread your message; we have read your
books; most Â·of all we have remained absolutely
free, as you bade us, from all disastrous entangle-
ments and alliances." How many could say, "Here
is your Society as clean as when you gave it to us."
Could Theosophists do this or would they become
abashed and unable to gaze into the great sad,
luminous eyes of the first and greatest Theosophist?
INTRODUCTION 17
Could Madame Blavatsky walk through the corri-
dors of Adyar and turn to those who represent her
in the twentieth century and say, "Well done, good
and faithful servants?" If she could not say this,
why not? Is it because they have remembered her
name and forgotten her work? Is it because weak,
petty men and women have so forgotten the great-
er good that they have elevated themselves to power
upon the wreakage of ideals? Theosophists of the
world, rededicate yourselves to the noblest spirit
that was among you, whose labors are your wealth,
whose ideals are your purpose, and whose unselfish
sacrifice is the cornerstone of your organization.
Suppose, in the same spirit, that Max Heindel
returned to the fields of his earthly labors and in
simple gabardine walked among his followers. Sup-
pose he should say to them, "Brothers and sisters,
have you loved one another? I planted a rose Â·
garden of virtues; have you tended it carefully?
My name is upon your lips, hut is my work in your
hearts? Have you been true one to the other?
Have you labored unselfishly, impersonally? Have
you so greatly loved our Heavenly Father that you
have loved all men also?" How would The Rosi-
crucians answer him? Could they say, "Beloved
Brother, our constant inspiration, we have fol.
filled your works. in humility and gentleness. There
18 INTRODUCTION
has been no pride among us, no selfishness, no
personality, no small ambitions at a great cost.
Here is the Fellowship you gave into our keeping.
We can return it as beautiful, as clean, as united in
holy purpose as you intended it to be. There is no
jot and tittle observance here; we are united not in
petty things but in great things. In the fifteen
years since you passed away into greater life we
have sought to do your work. We are as you in-
tended us to be-men and women in whom there is
no guile." Would these words be true? If not, why
would they not be true? Is man too weak to carry
on a good work ? Is his littleness so great and his
greatness so little?
If we would feel ashamed if our leaders should
return to us 3gain and we should know that we
have failed them, let us rededicate ourselves to them.
Let the spirit of H. P. Blavatsky be reborn in the
heart of each Theosophist and the spirit of Max
Heindel live again in the heart of each Rosicrucian.
When this time comes, and may it come, the mystics
and the occultists of the world can clasp hands
across the gulf of their differences and, united in
purpose, be an army of spiritual reconstruction
marching like the prophets of old in the vanguard
of progress.

MAX HEINDEL
A SHORT BIOGRAPHY
AX HEINDEL, known as the great-
3.
est western mystic of the twentieth
~ century, was born on July 23rd, 1865,
c~~~
:;,~ of the royal family of Von Grasshoffs,
who were connected with the Ger-
man Court during the life-time of Prince Bismark.
The father of Max Heindel was Francois L. von
Grasshoff. He migrated, when quite a young man,
to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he married a Dan-
ish woman of noble birth. Three children blessed
this union, two sons and one daughter. The old-
est of these sons was Carl Louis Von Grasshoff,
who later adopted the pen name of Max Heindel.
The father died when the eldest son was six years
of age, leaving the mother with her three small
children in very straitened circumstances.
The mother's pride of family and name forced
her with her family of three children to live in
19
20 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
genteel poverty so that the small income would suf-
fice. Self-denial was carried to an extreme in order
that her sons and daughter could have private
tutors so that they might take their place in society
as became the sons and daughters of nobility.
This life did not please the eldest son who left
home at the age of sixteen years and wounded his
mother's pride by entering the ship-yards at Glas-
gow, Scotland, where he learned the engineering
profession. He was chosen as Chief Engineer of a
trading steamer while yet very young. This took
him into the Orient, and his trips all over the world
in the capacity of engineer gave Max Heindel a great
deal of knowledge of the world and its people. For
a number of years he was Chief Engineer on one of
the large passenger steamers of the Cunard Line
plying between America and Europe.
Between the years 1895 and 1901, he was a con-
sulting engineer in the city of New York. His
first marriage was full of disappointments and sor-
row and ended by the death of his wife in 1905.
Max Heindel came to Los Angele-s, California,
in 1903, where he acted as engineer for a time but
ill luck overtook him. Hunger and privation were
his daily companions but nevertheless he was not
idle. With a dauntless spirit and a determination
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 21
to succeed along more advanced mental lines, he
became interested in the study of metaphysics and
joined the Theosophical Society of Los Angeles, ot
which he was vice-president in 1904 and 1905. His
heart was ever longing for the knowledge of the
deeper mysteries of life. His earlier years had
been full of sorrow and had awakened his mind to
search for the explanation of life and being and
had created in him a desire to understand the sor-
rows, privations and su(ferings of humanity. The
thought which was ever uppermost in his mind was
to find some means by which he could help to lift
the burdens of his brothers and sisters in the world.
This light began to dawn when he contacted the
teachings which had been given out by Madame
Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society. While con-
nected with this society he met the woman who
was years later to become his spiritual inspiration.
She it was who helped him to find his work, for
Augusta Foss was also interested along similar lines
of research and she was instrumental in interesting
Max Heindel in the science of astrology. In this
science he found a field with many possibilities in
that it is truly a science of the soul. It gave him
the.key by which he could unlock the mysteries of
man's inner nature. By learning to know and un-
derstand the weaknesses of character he could then
22 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
help to guide the people and help them to find
their proper place in the world.
Overwork and privation brought on a severe
spell of heart trouble in 1905 and for months he
lay at the point of death but upon recovery he
was even more keenly awake to the needs of hu-
manity. He realized that it was not so much
from the need of physical food that mankind suf-
fered as it was because of soul hunger which lead
them to do the things that brought suffering upon
them. H e started out on a lecture tour which
eventually led him to Germany.
While in Germany, in the fall of 1907, where he
had gone with the hopes of contacting the Elder
Brothers of the Rosicrucian Order, he was unsuc-
cessful, as it appeared to him, and in great dejection
he prepared to return to America; but one day a
visitor appeared to him whom he later learned was
an Elder Brother of the Rosicrucian Order, (and
who became his Teacher). This Being was clothed
in his vital body, and offered to impart to him the
teachings for which he had spent time and money
to find in Germany; but these teachings could only
be given after he, Max Heindel, would make a
solemn promise never to divulge them, (they must
be kept secret). Having passed through an un-
happy period of soul hunger he was most desirous
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 23
of sharing his knowledge with others, who like
himself were also seeking, he refused to accept any-
thing which he could not pass on to the world. The
Teacher left him. .
Later the Teacher appeared in his room again and
told him that he, Max Heindel, had stood his test.
He stated that if he had accepted the offer, namely,
to keep the teachings secret from the world, he, the
Elder Brother, would not have returned. He was
told that the candidate whom they had first chosen,
who had been under their instruction for several
years, had failed to pass his test in 1905; also that
Max Heindel had been under the observation of
the Elder Brothers for a number of year~ as the
most fit candidate, should the first one fail. In ad-
dition he was told that the teachings must be given
to the public before the close of the first decade of
the century, which would be the end of December,
1909.
At this last interview with the Teacher he was
given instructions how to reach the Temple of the
Rose Cross. At this Temple Max Heindel spent a
little over one month in direct communication with
and under the personal instructions of the Elder
Brothers, who imparted to him the greater part of
the teachings contained in the Rosicrucian Cosmo
Conception. The first draft of this book, which
24 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
was made while he was in the Temple, the Teacher
told him was but an outline. The heavy psychic
atmosphere of Germany was particularly adapted
to the communication of mystical thought to the
consciousness of the candidate, but he was told that
the three hundred and fifty pages of manuscript
which he had written would not satisfy him when
he reached the electric atmosphere of America and
that he would then wish to rewrite the entire book.
In his great enthusiasm he at first doubted this. He
felt that he had received a wonderfully complete
message. But the Elder Brother's predictions were
true. After Mr. Heindel had spent a few weeks in
New York City, what the Elder Brother had told
him proved to be a fact. The style in which the
manuscript was written did not then please him,
and he set about the work of rewriting.
He returned to America in the spring of 1909
where he at once started to formulate the Rosicru-
cian message which he had received from the Elder
Brothers. This was given to the world in the form
of a book entitled The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Concept-
ion, which is a masterpiece of mystical literature.
It contains one of the most comprehensive, simply
written, and complete histories of the evolution of
the earth and man that has been written for centur-
ies. A minister of one of the churches in the north-
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 25
western part of America made the statement that
he had two books on his library table which gave
him his thoughts for his sermons; one was the
Bible and the other was Max Heindel's "Rosicru-
cian Cosmo-Conception" which unlocked the mys-
teries of the Bible to him. This book is now trans-
lated into eight different languages.
In November 1909, after a successful lecture
tour, Max Heindel returned to Los Angeles where
he met with much success in lecturing and teaching.
In August 1910, he was joined in marriage to
Augusta Foss, the woman who had been instru-
mental in helping him to find the truth. With
this added help and inspiration the field of his work
so greatly increased that it soon became necessary
that a Headquarters be established for the purpose
of disseminating the Rosicrucian Philosophy. For
the first eight months these two pioneers lived in
a small three room bungalow in Ocean Park, Cali-
fornia, with little money but a determined spirit
to :start correspondence courses in the Rosicrucian
philosophy. Later they moved permanently to
Oceanside, California.
In those ten years that Max Heindel lived, to
start this great work for the Brothers of the Rose
Cross, he gave as many volumes to the world as
26 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
is ordinarily given in the life-time of an author. His
brain children are many and the following books,
which this wonderful man left as a legacy to the
world are:
"The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception"
"The Rosicrucian Mysteries"
"The Weh of Destiny"
"Teachings of an Initiate"
"Freemasonry and Catholicism"
"Letters to Students"
"The Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and
Answers"
"Gleanings of a Mystic"
"Mysteries of the Great Operas"
"The Rosicrucian Principles of Child Training"
"How Shall We Know Christ at His Coming?"
"The Mystical Interpretation of Christmas"
"Simplified Scientific Astrology"
"The Message of the Stars" '*'
Max Heindel suffered constantly on account of
injuries received while a young boy. A number of
unsuccessful operations, which had removed some
of the veins and-arteries of his left leg, greatly inter-
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 27
fered with the circulation in the body. He later
developed val\rular heart trouble. However, he was
blessed with an indomitable will and great energy~
and would never permit physical disability to inter-
fere with his work for humanity. He had a mess-
age to give to the soul sick world and nothing must
interfere. Many of his lessons, letters and books
were written while propped up in bed, after spend-
ing nights of suffering. But the world did not
know, for the faithful wife shielded him and was
ever ready to assist and encourage him. These two
souls faced many dark days together, but still happy
in each others' love, knowing that they were the
instruments by which a great message was to be
given to the world.
In the spring of 1910 after a course of lectures
and lessons delivered in the City of Los Angeles,
Max Heindel was taken seriously ill with leakage
of the heart. While in the hospital; and after the
consultation of several doctors, who, under the im~
pression that their patient was unconscious, dis-
cussed his case hy the side of his bed, he heard
them state that Heindel could not live through the
night, that his case was hopeless~ After the doctors
were gone, Max Heindel, with the assistance of
his Teacher, worked on his body with the result
that within three hours after the doctors had pro-
28 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
nounced his doom he requested a friend, who
called to take him for an airing in a wheeled
chair; and within one week after this experience
Max Heindel was dictating his second book, "The
Rosicrucian Philosophy in Questions and Answer!'
to a stenographer. After this book was finished
Max Heindel again started a tour to lecture in the
States of Washington and Oregon, but he was un-
able to stand the strain of meeting the public, so
he returned to Southern California and again was
seriously ill as a result of overwork. After this
illness he was so filled with the desire to write that
he dictated his third book, "The Rosicrucian Mys-
teries." Strange to say Max Heindel accomplished
his best work immediately after each severe illness,
chen it seemed that he was closer to his Teacher
and in rapport with the spiritual worlds.
With very little money and a suffering body Max
Heindel and his brave and loyal helpmate started
their pioneer work in Oceanside, California, from
where the Rosicrucian Teachings were distributed
and spread over the entire globe. The various books
have been translated and printed in foreign lan-
guages; lessons were being sent out by correspond-
ence and groups formed in many of the larger cities.
Like an endless chain the Teachings have spread,
but the work on the physical plane for this great
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 29
messenger was drawing to a close. His companion
had been well trained to carry on the work on the
physical plane for a greater work awaited him on
the higher planes. He was well aware that his days
were few, and he prepared his work so that when
his call came Mrs. Heindel could go on without
him. The last few days of his life he seemed very
peaceful, even happy, wanting Mrs. Heindel with
him in his office. After lunch on January 6th, 1919,
she was called to her office to finish some work in
directing the many secretaries. About 4 P. M. Max
Heindel, who had drafted a letter to the local Post-
mistress, brought the letter into Mrs. Heindel's of-
fice for her approval, for he would never make any
changes or start any new projects unless he con-
sulted his trusted partner. While Mrs. Heindel was
reading this letter, Max Heindel, who had been
standing by her side, dropped slowly to the carpet;
he did not fall heavily as is usually the case but as
if lovinghands were holding him and laying him
down gently. His last words as he looked up smil-
ing into Mrs. Heindel's face were, "I am all right
dear," and he passed into unconsciousness. With
these loving words on his lips he passed into the
Great Beyond, where he had through his devotion
to God and humanity prepared a great work with
the band of Invisible Helpers, through which the
30 BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL
work of healing is carried on. Is Max Heindel's
work finished? No indeed, for the special work
in which the Rosicrucian Order is interested is that
of the lnt1isible Helpers-through which a great
work of healing is being accomplished-Max Hein-
del was assured by his Teacher that he was the in-
strument through which a great movement was to
be inaugurated, a movement which had a special
mission: TO MAKE THE CHRISTIAN RELIG-
ION A LIVING FACTOR IN THE LAND.
The struggles of these two great messengers,
Madame Blavatsky and Max Heindel, were very
similar. 'Both these spirits were encased in suffer-
ing bodies, and both were in need of financial help
which was denied them, both were unappreciated
and neglected by their friends until death had taken
them, then the world began to realize their great-
ness. .
Max Heindel was a great admirer of Madame
Blavatsky, he saw in her his own future struggles,
he too after he had contacted the Brothers of the
Rose Cross, with spirit aflame with the desire to
give to the world this greater knowledge which he
had contacted, knowing that his years were num-
bered and that his physical body could not long
stand the strain of the pioneer life. Like Madame
Blavatsky he was in constant physical pain and in
BIOGRAPHY OF MAX HEINDEL 31
great need of help, both physical and financial.
The struggle and hardships which both these souls
suffered was greatly responsible in shortening their
days in the physical body. But what a great work
they have have accomplished, what a Boon to
humanity they have been.
"Great truths are portions of the soul of man;
Great souls are portions of eternity."
Lowell.
BLAVATSKY
AND THE SECRET
DOCTRINE
By MAX HEINDEL
CHAPTER I
â¢ HE SECRET DOCTRINE is one of
the most remarkable books in the
world. I realize how far beyond my
~~ feeble powers is the task of conveying
- an adequate idea of the teachings con-
tained within its covers. It has a history, however,
a history of peculiar interest to the student who
from its rich store seeks to garner the wisdom
which, as the apostle has said, is like meat fit only
for the strong. How it came to be written, and
under what circumstances it was written, is the
topic of this book. I shall endeavor to give in as
simple and comprehensive language as possible an
outline of the plan upon which the work was built
and the teaching it reveals. The nature of the task
33
34 BLAVATSKY AND THE
is such that I am forced to quote freely from Theo-
sophical literature, especially from Colonel Olcott's
Old Diary Leaves, Countess Wachmeister's Remi-
niscences, The Secret Doctrine itself, and other
works.
It is first necessary for us to realize that Madame
Blavatsky, or as she liked to be called, H. P. B.,
was, as she herself often expressed it, only the com-
piler of the work. Behind her stood the real teach-
ers, the guardians of the Secret Wisdom of the
ages, who taught her all the occult lore which she
transmitted in her writings. She had a threefold
ability which eminently qualified her for the task.
First, she was able to assimilate the transcendental
knowledge which came to her. Second, she was
a worthy messenger of the Masters. Third, she
had a marvelous aptitude for rendering abstruse
Eastern metaphysical thought into a form intellig-
ible to Western minds, and for verifying and com-
paring Eastern Wisdom with Western Science. She
also deserves great credit for her high moral cour-
age in representing to the world thoughts and
theories wholly at variance with materialistic sci-
ence. Many of these teachings, however, have
since been verified by science.
CHAPTER II
~~~~sUMANKIND has always persecuted, tor-
tured, and killed those who in thought
have been in advance of their age. Wit-
ness Copernicus, whom only a natural
~=~'\;f) death saved from a fate similar to that
which half a century later overtook Bruno. Gali-
leo was harassed all his life, and finally when old
and broken in body and spirit by the abuse of the
clergy, was forced to retract on his knees all of his
teachings which was at variance with the common-
ly accepted views of the time. The same fate was
shared by countless others. The seed which these
men had sown, however, was not only indestruct-
ible, but grew and grew until one day the world
woke up to find that what once was denounced
as heresy had become the commonly ~xpiessed
opinion. Then came the epilog of the drama-
when a Thorwaldsen immortalised in marble the
same Nikolas Copernicus who, once persecuted,
was proudly claimed as her son by Russia, or when
35
36 BLAVATSKY AND THE
amid the cheers of his countrymen was reared the
statue of Giordano Bruno on the same spot where
fanatical monks had danced around his funeral
pyre and burned the genius in the name of God.
At one time in the history of the West, men
were scourged for the sake of the Christian re-
ligion. When Christianity became strong, it at-
tempted to suppress science, which was then but
a fledgling. Science, however, grew stronger and
stronger, gradually forcing the Church into its
present apologetic attitude. Then the world slow-
1y sahk into a state of unbelief. Nothing which
could not be weighed or measured was accepted.
Anyone who dared to assert the existence of any-
thing superphysical was at once stamped as an im-
postor. Science and religion vied with each other
in their efforts to heap obloquy and opprobrium
on such individuals.
With the foregoing in mind, we can better ap-
preciate the great moral courage of H. P. B., and
see why that courage constituted one of her quali-
fications as a messenger of the Masters.
In the same materialistic attitude of the world
of that day is also to be found the reason for mak-
ing use of phenomena. Many thoughtful persons
have sincerely regretted that this part of the sub-
SECRET DOCTRINE 37
ject should ever have been taken up by the Society,
but H. P. B. always maintained that in the early
days of her work these proceedings were absolute-
ly necessary. This opinion was changed in the last
years when the Master himself told her that phe-
nomena had been a hindrance rather than a help
to The Secret Doctrine in Europe and that it would
have been better had only the philosophy been
given.
In 1884 it was thought among the leaders of the
Theosophical Society that the time had arrived for
a revision and an amplification of Madame Blavat-
sky's first book Isis Unveiled, and that she was to
rewrite it, with the late T. Subba Row as co-editor.
All through the year they collected material. Then
Colonel Olcott and Mr. Cooper-Oakley formulated
a plan, and it was announced that the work would
be published in twenty parts of about seventy-seven
pages each. But on the 8th of January, 1885, H.
P. B.'s Master communicated to her the scheme of
The Secret Doctrine, and as a result, the original
plans were abandoned.
Soon afterwards the heart trouble from which
Madame Blavatsky was suffering became so serious
that her physician, Dr. Mary Scharlich, insisted
upon her leaving India if she would save her life.
Acting upon this advice, H. P. B. left Adyar, the
38 BLAVATSKY AND THE
spot she loved most on earth, in the spring of 1885.
We next find her installed in a cheap little inn on
the northern slope of Vesuvius. The room is almost
bare of !furniture, the floor is of stone. Through
the crevices in windows and door blows a cold
wind which aggravates the rheumatism of the poor
"old lady" as she sits writing at her rickety old
table far from friends, alone in a foreign country,
the language of whose inhabitants she did not un-
der-stand, sick in body, and chafing under the in-
justice done her by those whom she had befriended.
Thus, inauspicious were the circumstances attend-
ing the first work on The Secret Doctrine.
In the fall of 1885 she went to the quaint old
German town of Wurzburg. What associations
this name calls forth-thoughts of Martin Luther,
the stern and unflinching reformer who vowed that
he would go to Worms to defend his faith against
the Romish priests though the roofs of the city were
covered with devils.
Not more staunch and unflinching was he than
this new reformer who with dogged persistence,
despite sickness and adverse criticism, toiled at her
desk from day to day when she might have had
ease and comfort.
CHAPTER III
OME time after Madame Blavatsky ar-
- ...
~ rived at Wurzburg she was joined by
I) the Countess Wachmeister, who loyal-
J,'~
,,~.;;:~~ ly and lovingly helped in the great
/ '- - work. The number of visitors caused
H. P. B. in a letter to a friend to write that the
city was becoming a philosophical Medina. Con-
tinuing, she wrote:
"I am only in the middle of Part One, but shall
in a month send you the first six sections. I take
from Isis only facts, leaving out everything in the
shape of dissertations, attacks on Christianity and
Science-in short, all the useless stuff, and all that
has lost its interest. Only myths, symbols and
dogmas, explained from the esoteric point of view.
It is actually and de facto a new work entirely.
Cycles are explained from the occult side."
Her insight into problems of philosophy, racial
origins, fundamental bases of religions, and keys
39
40 BLAVATSKY AND THE
to old symbols was phenomenal; yet it was not the
result of study, for never was a student more eccen-
tric and restless. Of trained literary faculty she had
none. She wrote under inspiration; thoughts flash-
ed through her brain like meteors. Scenes often
painted themselves before her mental vision and
died out when only half caught. Because of her
excessive use of parentheses, many sentences were
inordinately long. Like Shakespeare and other
geniuses, she would take material where she found
it, and work it into the mosaic upon which she put
the stamp of her own individuality, and around
which she wove the golden web of her own high
powers.
In one of her letters she announced that the
enormous volume of introductory stanzas, the first
chapter on the Archaic Period and Cosmogony,
was ready. "But how," she goes on, "how send
them to Adyar? Suppose they are lost! I do not
remember one word of them and so we would be
cooked! Well - - has read them through twice
and started the third time. He has not found one
part to be corrected in the English, and he says he
is amazed at the gigantic erudition and the sound-
nes of it, showing the esotericism of the Bible and
its incessant parallels with the Vedas and Brah-
manas. This is a little more wonderful yet than
SECRET DOCTRINE 41
Isis, that you corrected and Wilder suggested. Now
I am absolutely alone with my armchair and ink-
stand and no books to speak of. In about four
hours I wrote a whole section and the introduction
of a whole Stanza (about forty pages) without
any books around me. Simply listening-simply
listening."
Can we realize what that means? She was
merely writing what was transmitted to her clair-
audiently, as Colonel Olcott and others had seen
her do day by day. Herein lies the answer to the
traducers who have accused her of plagiarism. I
am satisfied that never in one instance was she
guilty of having consciously appropriated another's
wntmgs. She may, however, have drawn them
direct spiritually, or having received them second-
hand from that great store-house of human thought
and mental products, the Akasha, where, as drops
are merged in the ocean, personal begetters of
thought are lost in the infinite Mind, save to those Â·
most advanced intelligences who can count the sand
grains or the drops in the ocean and pick out the
atoms in their vortices.
About December, 1886, Colonel Olcott received
the first volume of The Secret Doctrine for revision
by T. Subba Row and himself, but Mr. Row refused
to do more than read it, saying that if he touched
42 BLAVATSKY AND THE
it he would have to rewrite it, as it was full of mis-
takes. This was mere pique, but it had its effect,
for when his remark was reported to H.P. B., she
was greatly distressed. She set to work revising
the manuscript carefully, correcting many errors
due to slipshod literary methods, and with the
help of friends, especially Bertram and Archibald
Keightley, put the book into the shape in which
it was first published.
She was always eager to have her mistakes
pointed out, and was also ready to correct them.
The errors occurred especially in such of her writ-
ings as were not dictated to her psychically by the
Master. Frequently she would ruthlessly destroy
faulty pages. Often at a word from the Master she
would consign to the flames reams of laboriously
prepared and copied manuscript, to the intense
grief of her friends. Countess Wachmeister re-
lated that one day when she went into Madame
Blavatsky's writing room she found the floor strewn
with discarded manuscript. To her question about
it, H. P. B. replied, "Yes, I have tried twelve times
to write this one page correctly and each time
Master says it is wrong! I think I shall go mad
writing it so often, but leave me alone; I will not
pause until I have conquered it even if I have to go
on all night." The Countess brought her a cup of
SECRET DOCTRINE 43
coffee to refresh her and then left her to pursue
her weary task.
An hour later Madame Blavatsky called her and
said the task had been accomplished. The labor
had been prodigious and the rnsult small, as was
often the case when she had been annoyed. This is
apparent from her answer to the Countess' question
as to how she could make mistakes in setting down
what was given her. She replied, "Well, you see,
it is like this. I make what I can only describe as
a sort of a vacuum in the air before me and fix my
sight and my will intently upon it, and soon scene
after scene passes before me like the successive
pictures of a diorama; or, if I need a reference, as
information from some book, I fix my mind in-
tently, and the astral counterpart of the book ap-
pears and from it I take what I need. The more
perfectly my mind is freed from distraction.. the
more easily I can do this, but after the annoying
letter I had this morning I could not concentrate
properly, and each time I tried I got the quotation
all wrong. It is all right now, however, so Master
says."
H. P. B. often asked her friends in various parts
of the world to verify quotations from books which
could be found in libraries where such friends re-
sided. Thus, she would need verification of a pass-
44 BLAVATSKY AND THE
age from a book of which only one copy was extant
and that in the Library of the Vatican. Again, a
friend in London would be asked to verify a quota-
tion from some document possessed only by the
British Museum. It should be noted, however,
that she needed only verification. The subject mat-
ter she already had.
Madame Blavatsky stated that she was only the
mouthpiece of the Masters-writing, speaking, and
acting, as directed by them. This has been ridi-
culed and she herself caracterized as a rogue and an
impostor. There are, however, certain incontro-
vertible facts to be taken into consideration by
those who wish to form a fair and unbiased opin-
ion. When she wrote The Secret Doctrine she had
around her only a handful of ordinary books.
From such sources she could have obtained but
little to help her. We cannot in this way account
for the extraordinary and prodigious knowledge
manifest in The Secret Doctrine. Most of the time
during which the work was written, she was hun-
dreds of miles from any library of consequence.
Had she been able financially to travel from libra-
ry to library she would have been physically unable
to seek out the passages she is accused of having
plagiarised. She never said that she discovered the
knowledge she gave the world. Her contention
SECRET DOCTRINE 45
was that it came from the remote past; that it is in
every scripture and in every philosophy.
The purpose of The Secret Doctrine is to quote
from every scripture of every religion, from the
writings of every people, in order to show the
identity of the teachings and prove the antiquity
of the subject-matter. What is new in the book
lies not in the nature of its facts or ideas, for these
can be found scattered among the works of various
Orientalists and in the numerous sacred books
which have long existed. What is new is the
selection by H. P. B. from all sources of facts which
together form a single mighty concept of the evo-
1ution of the universe and of man-the coherent
synthesis of the whole cosmogony. She qualifies as
the greatest Teacher of the time because she had real
knowledge and not mere book learning. She had
that which enabled her to gather from many books
in many places the truths which, fitted together,
made one great whole. She held the clue which
she was able to follow with unerring accuracy
through the maze, and show that each individual
material held within itself the possibility of becom-
ing the single edifice.
Her work is the more extraordinary because she
<lid it without being a scholar; without having ha<l
the education which would have fitted her to some
"16 BLAVATSKY AND THE
extent for piecing together this knowledge; be-
cause she did what none of the Orientalists have
done with all their learning, what not all of them
together have done with all their knowledge of
Eastern tongues and their study of Eastern litera-
ture. Not one of them out of such a motley of
material was able to synthesize such a momentous
work. Not one of them out of that chaos was able
to build up a cosmos-but this Russian woman
with little education did it. She who was no
scholar and did not pretend to be one, somewhere
gained a knowledge that enabled her to do what
no one else-scholar or sciolist-has done. Some-
where she received that which made it possible for
her to transform chaos to order and to produce a
work which conveys to us an understanding of the
universe and man. She said it was not hers. She
frequently spoke of her own lack of knowledge,
and referred to Those who taught her. This brings
us to the other part of the attacks made on Madame
Blavatsky, or rather on the Masters, the existencl!
of whom is regarded as a myth.
The learning and ability which she herself dis-
claims is not challenged by her enemies. They
sometimes say that her knowledge is poorly di-
gested, that she arranges her material badly, that
her writings are misty, involved, self-contradictory.
SECRET DOCTRINE 47
But that she possessed an extraordinary fund of
varied knowledge bearing on out-of-the-way topics
and obscure philosophies is freely admitted. If she
was a fraud, why was she such a fool as to invent
imaginary Teachers? Why should she make them
the fathers of her knowledge, and so become a
target for abuse and slander, while she might have
gained esteem, to say nothing of money, by the
simple and easier course of taking the entire credit
herself? Can anything more preposterous be im-
agined than for a Russian woman of noble family,
married to a high official, to go out into the world
on a wild goose-chase after imaginary Teachers,
and having acquired an immense mass of recondite
knowledge at great cost and suffering, to throw
away the credit of acquiring it, to ascribe it to non-
existent persons, to face slander, abuse and calum-
ny instead of utilizing it in the common way, to
remain an exile from her own country, to be poor
and despised when she might have been wealthy
and honored? Looked at from any standpoint
consistent with reason, the only tenable conclusion
is that H. P. B. told the truth when she affirmed
that her knowledge was received through the Mas-
ters of Wisdom.
A curious fact in connection with images of
books as seen in the astral light is that the text some-
48 BLAVATSKY AND THE
times appears reversed as if held before a mirror.
With a little practice it becomes easy to read words,
as the context and general sense prevent mistakes,
but reading figures correctly is more difficult.
Sometimes Madame Blavatsky forgot to reverse
them, causing much trouble and annoyance to her-
self and others. For example, if she wrote to a
friend asking him to verify a passage on page 341
of a certain book, the answer might come back
that the passage could not be found there, or that
there were not that many pages in the book. Look-
ing the matter up it was invariably found in such
cases that H. P. B. had forgotten to reverse the
number. So (to take the same instance) it should
have been 143 instead of 341. After a time, her
correspondents discovered this, and then easily
corrected such mistakes themselves.
Another noteworthy circumstance in connection
with the writing of The Secret Doctrine was that
if Madame Blavatsky ever wanted definite infor-
mation on any subject, it was sure to reach her in
some way, either in a letter from a friend, in a
newspaper or a magazine, or in the course of
casual reading of books. This happeded with such
frequency and appositeness that it could not be
explained on the basis of coincidence. Whenever
possible, she used normal means, so as not to
SECRET DOCTRINE
exhaust her powers. In the early days of the Socie-
ty, she had not been prudent in this, and afterward
she felt the effects.
One day there came a temptation in the offer
of a large yearly salary if she would write for the
Russian newspapers. She might write on any sub-
ject she chose, occultism included. Here was :i
promise of comfort and ease for the remainder
of her days. Two hours a day would be ample to
satisfy all demands on her time. But she said,
"To write such a work as The Secret Doctrine, I
must have all my thoughts in that direction, to
keep in touch with the current. It is difficult
enough as it is, hampered as I am with this sick
and worn out old body, and it would be imposs-
ible to change the current back and forth from
The Secret Doctrine to newspaper writing. I have
no longer the energy left in me. Too much of it
was exausted in performing phenomena." When
asked why she did these things when she must
have known that she was wasting her strength
and it would have been much better if no phe-
nomena had been connected with her work,
she answered, "Because people were continually Â·
bothering me. It was always, 'Oh, do materialize
this,' or 'Do let me hear those astral bells' and so
on, and then I did not like to disappoint people,
50 BLAVATSKY AND THE
so I acceded to their requests. Now I have to suf-
fer for it, and moreover, at the time the Society
was started it was necessary to draw people's at-
tention, and phenomena did this more effectually
than anything else could have done."
Granted, then, that phenomena were necessary
at that time, the mischief lay in the fact that, once
introduced, they were difficult to get rid of when
they had served their purpose. All came eager to
have their curiosity gratified, and if disappointed,
went away in great wrath and indignation, ready
to denounce the whole thing as a fraud. So in her
anxiety for the welfare of the Society, poor H.P. B.
continued the work, knowing that she was squan-
dering her vitality. Thus she almost literally gave
her life blood for the good of the organization.
After the Society was fairly well established
came the opportunity to have ease and comfort
for the rest of her days. Can we realize what that
meant? Picture Madame Blavatsky in her dingy
little apartment with but one bedroom, which she
shared with the Countess Wachmeister. In that
obscure old German town she was virtually an exile
among a foreign and unfamiliar people. Here she
toiled at her desk twelve to fourteen hours a day,
and was often in the most straitened circumstances.
Then came the offer from the newspaper. She
SECRET DOCTRINE 51
could write about anything she pleased, and receive
a salary that would place her far beyond the pale
of want-all for about two hours a day of her time.
Seemingly it would involve only a small sacrifice
of time; but H.P. B. knew better. She knew tha1
she could not write for newspapers and write The
Secret Doctrine also. Unflinchingly she wrote the
letter declining the offer, and thus added another
to the long list of sacrifices she had already laid
on the altar of the Society and of humanity.
From Wurzburg, Madame Blavatsky went to
Elberfeld, where she stayed with Madame Geb-
hard. Here it seems that little if any work was
done on The Secret Doctrine, owing to the fact
that she fell and sprained her ankle. Her kind
friends nursed her tenderly, but recovery seemed
to be slow. Her sister and niece were sent for, and
with them she went to Ostend, from which place
she wrote to the Countess Wachmeister:
"Yes, I will try to settle once more at my Secret
Doctrine but it is hard. I am very weak. I fed
so poorly and legless as I never did when you were
there to care for me. I feel I am ungrateful. But
then gratitude has ever been shown in ancient sym-
bology to reside in people's heels, and having lost
my legs how can I be expected to have any?" Later
she wrote: "My poor lei's have parted company
52 BLAVATSKY AND THE
with my body. I am now as legless as any elemen-
tal can be, and I do not know a soul in Ostend;
not a solitary Russian here but myself, who would
rather be a Turk and go back to India, but I can't,
for I have neither legs nor reputation, according
to the infamous charges of the S. P. R."*
Soon afterwards, the Countess Wachmeister
again joined H. P. B. They had a number of
visitors from England, Germany, and France,
Ostend being easy of access from these countries.
Madame Blavatsky wrote steadily, though her health
was very poor and she frequently fretted, as evi-
denced by the following extract from one of her
letters in which she says, "Because lies, hypocrisy
and jesuitism reign supreme in this world, and I
am not and cannot be either, therefore I seem
doomed. Because I am tired of life and the strug-
gles with that Stone of Sisyphus and the eternal
work of the Danaides, and I am not permitted to
get out of this misery and rest because I am one
too many on this earth, I am doomed."
This state of mind was probably occasioned
chiefly by the extremely poor health which soon
after came to a crisis, when she was stricken with
kidney trouble. The Belgian physician said that
she could not live long, and in her despair the
â¢-The Society for Psychical Research.
SECRET DOCTRINE 53
Countess telegraphed to Dr. Ashton Ellis, one of
the London members of the Theosophical Society,
who immediately came to Ostend. He held out
no more hope than the Belgian doctor. Both were
agreed that they had never known a person with
kidneys so severely affected to live so long.
It seemed as if The Secret Doctrine would not
be finished-at least not by H. P. B. Anxious and
sorrowful were the hearts of those who surrounded
her. The grief of the Countess Wachmeister be-
came so great that she went into a swoon. She
recovered, and continued to be almost constantly
at the bedside of the sick woman. Awakening
one morning after a short sleep, she was surprised
to see Madame Blavatsky sitting up in bed, looking
calmly at her.
"Countess, come here!"
The Countess obeyed, asking: "What is the
matter, H. P. B.? You look so different."
She replied, "Yes. Master has been here. He
gave me my choice-that I might die and be free
if I would, or live and finish The Secret Doctrine.
He told me how great would be my sufferings, and
what a terrible time I would have before me in
England (for I am to go there) but when I thought
34 BLAVATSKY AND THE
of those students to whom I shall be permitted to
teach a few things and of the T. S., to which I have
given my heart's blood already, I accepted the
sacrifice."
She then called for some breakfast and to the
surprise and joy of her friends, got up and went
into the dining-room, where later she received a
lawyer and the American Consul, who had come
to superintend the making of her will. One may
imagine the change of expression which came over
their faces when, instead of coming into the
presence of a dying woman, they found Madame
Blavatsky sitting in her armchair seemingly in the
best of health. Thus once more the specter of
<leath was thrust away and H. P. B. had taken
another lease on life.
The next visitors were Dr. Keightley and Mr.
Bertram Keightley of London, who bore urgent
invitations to Madame Blavatsky to come to Lon-
don. To this she finally consented. The Countess
left Ostend for Sweden, and shortly H. P. B
journeyed to London, where with the Keightleys
she occupied a small cottage called Maycot. Here
the manuscript of The Secret Doctrine was finished.
It made a pile three feet high when it was given to
the Keightleys for correction of syntax, punctua-
tion, and spelling. The Keightleys found that it
SECRET DOCTRINE ;s
was not written in a consecutive manner, and out-
lined a plan of rearrangement which was approved
by Madame Blavatsky. The entire manuscript was
then typewritten.
Just before this work was finished, H .P. B. and
her friends moved to 17 Lansdowne Road, Notting
Hill, London, where they were joined by the
Countess Wachmeister and others, and there was
established the first Headquarters.
It was first arranged to have The Secret Doctrine
published by Mr. George Redway, who was pub-
lishing Lucifer, the magazine which had been
founded a short time before by H. P. B., and which
has since been called the T heosophicil Review, but
as his proposal was not financially satisfactory, and
a friend of Madame Blavatsky's offered to furnish
the money, an office was taken in Duke Street,
London, the primary object being to enable the
Theosophical Society to derive the utmost benefit
from her writings.
Of the further history of the writing of The
Secret Doctrine there is little to be said, though
several months more of hard work were necessary
before it was finally ready for the press. H. P. B.
read and corrected two sets of galley proof, then
a set of page proof and finally a revise in sheet,
56 BLAVATSKY AND THE
correcting, altering and adding until the last, with
the result that the printers' bill for corrections alone
amounted to $1,500.
Such is the story of The Secret Doctrine-a story
which, like the book itself, is derided by the majori-
ty of people, notwithstanding its authentication by
many persons of sound reason and blameless life.
As in the case of Copernicus and others, some day
the world will wake up and find that this much
abused woman was right. Will a monument be
raised to her? Who knows? Whether it will be
or not, the fact remains that in The Secret Doctrine
itself and in the affection with which its author is
regarded by every student who has been helped by
her is a monument more lasting than marble or
bronze. For, though the Masters were the actual
authors Â·of the work, let us not forget that it was
the zeal and devotion of H. P. B. which so excellent-
ly qualified her as an instrument for their use; and
but for that zeal and devotion we might not today
possess the greatest of modern works on occultism
-The Secret Doctrine.
CHAPTER IV
~'-~-~ E HAVE traced .the history of The
Secret Doctrine, from the time when
H. P. B.'s Master gave her the plan,
~iii')ll~~ll'.. until it was printed and given to the
, world. Now study the plan upon
which it was constructed, and try to catch a
glimpse of the teachings contained within its sev-
eral volumes.
When we contemplate the range of subjects
dealt with in this work-a range bounded only by
the universe-it is at once apparent how fragment-
ary must be any possible outline. The content of
The Secret Doctrine cannot be taught in one lec-
ture nor in a hundred lectures, even though such
a lecture course were given by the most learned
exponent. The work is a mine rich in priceless
gems of occult knowledge. Perserverance and in-
tuition are the pick and shovel by the diligent use of
which we may become possessed of these jewels
of great price. A truth discovered by ourselves stays
57
58 BLAVATSKY AND THE
with us after we have lost a dozen other truths ex-
plained to us by others. If therefore we can be in-
duced to dig within The Secret Doctrine for our-
selves, we shall profit more than if someone were
to explain to us every teaching contained within
its covers.
A cursory reading will prove a potent means of
bewildering the mind, as before us whirl demons
an<l devas, Dhyan Chohans and Kumaras, yugas
and cycles, satyrs and fakirs, adepts and alchem-
ists, Manus and monads, in a continuous phantas-
magoria. To be of value The Secret Doctrine must
be studied. Just as Theseus, who entered the laby-
rinth of Crete to do battle with the Minotaur, was
guided out of the maze by the thread of Ariadne,
so the student should fix his mind on one subject,
and plunge boldly into the maze to do battle with
the Minotaur of ignorance. If he persists, and holds
tight the golden thread of intuition, he will be sure
to bring out the priceless gem of knowledge of the
subject; and by his toil he will have made it part
of himself-a possession never to be lost. In this
way he may spend days in search of a small point,
but when he .understands that point, he will know
that the time was well spent. When at last he has
extracted as far as he is able the information con-
tained in The Secret Doctrine, there dawns upon
SECRET DOCTRINE 59
his mind a conception of the truth. I cannot de-
scribe the exultation I felt at that first view of that
truth, and how I meditated on it and admired it
as I saw it dovetail into all the general philosophies.
It should be remembered that the work which
we are considering is not by any means the whole
of the esoteric philosophy possessed by the Masters
of Wisdom, but only a small fragment of its fun-
damental tenets. The teachings of The Secret Doc-
trine, however fragmentary and incomplete, do not
belong to the Hindu, Zoroastrian, Chaldean, or
Egyptian religions; nor to Buddhism, Islamism, Ju-
daism or Christianity exclusively. The book contains
the essence of them all. Originating from the same
source, all are in these volumes resolved into their
original elements, out of which every mystery and
dogma has developed and become materialized.
The aim of the work is to show that Nature is not
a fortuitous concurrence of atoms, to assign to man
his rightful place in the scheme of the universe, to
rescue from degradation the archaic truths which
are the basis of all religions, to uncover to some
extent the fundamental unity from which they all
sprang, and finally to show that the occult side of
Nature has never been approached by the science
of modern civilization.
When an architect starts to build a modem sky-
60 BLAVATSKY AND THE
scraper he first prepares a solid foundation; upon
this he rears the massive steel beams to form the
skeleton of the building. This skeleton is then
clothed in walls and floors of concrete, terra cotta,
and other materials. A system of steam-pipes like
arteries carries heat to every room. Its nervous
system is an intricate network of electric light and
telephone wires, while in the basement throbs a
steam engine, driving an electric generator. The
result is an organic whole pulsing with life.
Somewhat similar was the precedure of the Mast-
ers of Wisdom who built the monumental struc-
ture of occult knowledge which we are considering.
A Mohammedan writer says, "In the assembly of
the day of resurrection the sins of Kabak will be
forgiven for the sake of the Lust of the Christian
Churches." Professor Max Muller replied, "The
sins of Islam are as worthless as the dust of Christ-
ianity. In the day of resurrection both Christians
and Mohammedans will see the vanity of their re-
ligious doctrines. Men fight about religion on
earth. In heaven they shall find out that there is
only one true religion." In other words, "There
is no religion higher than truth." Upon this
foundation of truth was raised by the Masters of
the Wisdom of the Ages the skeleton structure of
the Book of Dzyan, a Senzar manuscript of vast
SECRET DOCTRINE 61
antiquity, about which have been gathered all that
was good and true in all the world religions, ce-
mented by occult knowledge, and ornamented
with old symbols and myths. These were the more
beautiful for being deprived of the scale of mater-
ialism which for ages had covered them. The re-
sult is the congeries of transcendent philosophy con-
tained in The Secret Doctrine. It may be asked:
where are the arteries of steam pipes, the nervous
system of electric wires, the steam engine, and the
electric generator to vitalize the building? These
the student must himself supply by making it part
of himself, by taking it into his own life. In pro-
portion as he does this will be the life it has for
him, its measure and its limit being his devotion
to its ideals.
The Secret Doctrine establishes three funda-
mental postulates. The first is the existence of an
omnipresent, eternal, boundless and immutable
Principle on which all speculation is impossible,
since it transcends the power of human conception
and can only be dwarfed by any human expression
or similitude. It is beyond the range of thought,
unspeakable and unthinkable. This Be-ness is sym-
bolized in The Secret Doctrine under two aspects:
on the one hand is Absolute Abstract Space, repre-
senting base subjectivity-the one thing which no
62 BLAVATSKY AND THE
human mind can either exclude from any concep-
tion or conceive of by itself. On the other hand is
Absolute Abstract Motive, representing uncondition-
ed consciousness. This latter aspect is also spoken
of as the Great Breath, the One Reality. The
Absolute is the field of absolute consciousness, or
that essence which is out of all relation to condi-
tioned existence, and of which conscious existence
is a conditioned symbol; but once we pass in
thought from this absolute negation (to us), du-
ality supervenes in the contrast of Spirit (or Con-
sciousness) and Matter.
Spirit and Matter are to be regarded not as inÂ·
dependent realities, but as symbols or aspects of
the Absolute, which constitute the basis of condi-
tioned being, whether subjective or objective. Con-
sidering this metaphysical triad as the root from
which proceeds all manifestation, the Great Breath
assumes the character of precosmic ideation. It
is the fount of force and of all individual conscious-
ness, and supplies the guiding Intelligence in the
vast scheme of cosmic evolution. On the other
hand, precosmic root substance is the aspect of the
Absolute which underlies all the objective planes
of nature.
The manifested universe is pervaded by duality,
which is the very essence of its existence as M:u.:..
SECRET DOCTRINE 63
festation. But just as the opposite poles of subject
and object, spirit and matter, are but aspects of the
One Unity in which they are synthesized, so in the
manifested universe there is that which links spirit
to matter, subject to object. This something-at
present unknown to Western speculation-is called
by Eastern occultists Fohat. It is the "bridge" by
which ideas existing in the divine thought are im-
pressed on cosmic substance.
Thus frotn spirit or cosmic ideation comes our
consciousness; from cosmic substance come the
several vehicles in which that consciousness is in-
dividualized; while this substance in its various
manifestations is the mysterious link between mind
and matter, the principle vivifying every atom.
The second fundamental postulate of The Secret
Doctrine is the existence of eternity in toto as a
boundless plan~periodically the playground of
numberless universes which are incessantly mani-
festing and disappearing. This postulate is the ab-
solute universality of that law of periodicity, of
flux and reflux, ebb and flow, which physical
science has observed and recorded in all depart-
ments of nature. An alternation such as that of
day and night, waking and sleeping, life and
death, is in fact so common, so perfectly universal
64 BLAVATSKY AND THE
and without exception, that it is easy to see in it
one of the fundamental laws of the universe.
The third and last of the basic postulates of The
Secret Doctrine is the fundamental identity of all
souls with the universal Oversoul, the latter being
itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the
obligatory pilgrimage of every soul through a cycle
of incarnation. These souls or sparks are the Sons
abiding from everlasting, from the beginning of
the creative age in the bosom of the Father. They
are to be made perfect through sufferings. Each
soul is truly equal to the Father as concerns its God-
head, but inferior to the Father as concerns its
manhood, and each is to go forth into matter in
order to render all things subject to itself. The soul
is to be sown in weakness that it may be raised in
power, thus escaping from the limitations of a sta-
tic Logos, enfolding all divine powers, omniscient
and omnipresent on its own plane, but unconscious
on all other planes. Its glory is to be veiled in
soul-blinding matter in order that through experi-
ence, the soul may become omniscient and omni-
present on all planes, responsive to all divine vibra-
tions instead of to those on the highest planes only.
The pivotal doctrine of the hidden wisdom admits
of no privileges or special gifts in man save those
SECRET DOCTRINE 65
won by his own soul through a long senes of
metempsychoses and reincarnations.
Such are the basic conceptions on which The
Secret Doctrine rests. It would not be fitting here
to enter upon any defense or proof of their inherent
reasonableness, nor can I pause to show how they
are contained-though too often under a mislead-
ing guise-in all systems of thought or philosophy
worthy of the name. Once the student has gained
a clear comprehension of them and realized the
light they throw on every problem of life, he finds
that they need no further justification.
The history of cosmic evolution as traced in the
Stanzas of Dzyan may be regarded as the abstract
algebraic formula of that evolution. Hence the
student must not expect to find there an account
of all the stages and transformations which have
occurred between the beginnings of universal evo-
1ution and our present state. To give such an ac-
count would be as impossible as it would be in-
comprehensible to men who cannot grasp the na-
ture of even the plane of existence next to their
own. The Stanzas, therefore, give an abstract
formula which can be applied to all evolution-to
that of our tiny earth, to the chain of planets of
which our earth forms one, to the solar universe to
66 BLAVATSKY AND THE
which that chain belongs, and so on, in an ascend-
ing scale until the mind reels an is exaustcd in
the effort to understand.
The seven Stanzas of the first volume represent
the seven terms of the abstract formula to which
they refer, and describe the seven great stages of
the evolutionary process mentioned in the Hindu
philosophy as the seven creations, and in the Bible
as the days of creation.
Stanza No. 1: describes the condition of the
Absolute One during the interlude between cosmic
manifestations and before the first flutter of re-
awakening activity. A moment's consideration will
show how difficult it is to describe such a state.
Since it is a state of Absoluteness per se, it can
possess none of the specific attributes which serve
to describe objects in positive terms. Hence the
state can be suggested only by negatives involving
all the most abstract attributes which men feel
rather than conceive as the remotest limits attain-
able by their powers of conception. We are inÂ·
formed by the Stanza that:
Stanza No. 1: "The eternal parent wrapped in
her ever invisible robes had slumbered once again
for seven eternities. Time was not, for it lay
asleep in the infinite bosom of duration. Univer-
SECRET DOCTRINE 67
sal mind was not, for there were no Ah-Hi to con-
tain it. The seven ways to bliss were not. The
great causes of misery were not, for there was no,
one to produce and get ensnared by them. Dark-
ness alone filled the boundless all, for father, moth-
er and son were once more one, and the son had
not awakened yet for the new wheel, and his pil-
grimage thereon. The seven sublime lords and t~
seven truths had ceased to be, and the Universe,
the son of Necessity, was immersed in Paranish-
panna fthe Absolute], to be outbreathed by that
which is and yet is not. Naught was. The causes
of existence had been done away with; the visible
that was, and the invisible that is, rested in eter-
nal non-being-the one being. Alone the one form
of existence stretched boundless, infinite, causeless,
in dreamless sleep; and life pulsated unconscious
in universal space, throughout that All-presence
which is sensed by the opened eye of the Dangma
rthe inner spiritual eye of the seer, or the Third
EyelÂ·"
Stanza No. 2: describes a stage which to the
Western mind is so nearly identical with the first
that to explain the difference would require a trea-
tise in itself. A grasp of what it contains can be
obtained only through the intuition and higher
faculties of the student. Indeed, it must be re-
68 BLAVATSKY AND THE
membered that all the Stanzas appeal more to the
mner faculties than to the physical brain:
"Where were the Builders, the luminous Sons of
Manvantaric Dawn? â¢ â¢ â¢ The producers of
form from mJ-form-the root of the world-? â¢ â¢
Where was silence? Where the ears to sense it?
No, there was neither silence nor sound; naught
save ceaseless eternal breath, which knows itself
not. The hour had not yet struck; the ray had
not yet flashed into the Germ; the Matripadma
fMother-Lotus] had not yet swollen. â¢ â¢ â¢ The
universe was still concealed in the Divine thought
and the Divine bosom."
Stanza No. 3: describes the reawakening of the
universe to activity after rest. It depicts the emerg-
ence of the monads from their state of absorption
within the One. Thus begins the earliest and high-
est stage in the formation of worlds. The term
monad may apply to the vastest solar system and
the tiniest atom. Says the Stanza:
"The last vibration of the seventh eternity thrills
through infinitude. The mother swells, expand-
ing from within without, like the bud of the lotus.
The vibration sweeps along, touching with its
swift wing the whole universe and the germ that
dwelleth in darkness. The darkness that breathes
SECRET DOCTRINE 69
over the slumbering waters of life. Darkness radi-
ates light, and light drops one solitary ray into the
mother-deep. The ray shoots through the virgin
egg, the ray causes the virgin egg to thrill, and
drop the non-eternal germ, which condenses into
the world-egg. â¢ '*' â¢ Father-Mother spin a web
whose upper end is fastened to spirit-the light of
the one darkness-and the lower one to its shadowy
end, matter; and this web is the universe spun out
of ihe two substances made in one. â¢ â¢ â¢ It
expands when the breath of fire is upon it; it con-
tracts when the breath of the mother touches it.
Then the sons dissociate and scatter, to return into
their mother's bosom at the end of the great day,
and re-become one with her: â¢ â¢ â¢"
Stanza No. 4: shows the differentiation of the
germ of the universe into the septenary hierarchy of
conscious Divine Power which is the active mani-
festation of the one supreme energy. They are the
framers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of
all the manifested universe in the only sense in
which the name Creator is intelligible. They in-
form and guide it. They are intelligent beings
who adjust and control evolution, embodying in
themselves those manifestations of the one Law
which we know as the Law of Nature. This stage
of evolution is called in mythology the Creation
70 BLAVATSKY AND THE
of the Gods, but it is not a creation of gods in
the sense in which creation is generally understood
in the West, but as a reawakening into activity
of Beings who have acquired their transcendental
intelligence in former universes.
Stanza No. 5: "The Primordial. Seven, the First
Seven Breaths of the Dragon of Wisdom, produce
in their turn from their Holy Circumgyrating
Breaths the Fiery Whirlwind."
This stanza describes the process of world forma-
tion; first, diffused cosmic matter, then the fiery
whirlwind-the first stage in the formation of a
nebula. This nebula condenses, and after pass--
ing through various transformations forms a solar
universe, a planetary chain, or a single planet, as
the case may be.
Stanza No. 6: indicates the subsequent stages
in the formation of such a world, and brings its
evolution down to the fourth period-correspond-
ing to the period in which we are now living.
"â¢ â¢ * He builds them in the likeness of old-
er wheels, placing them on the Imperishable Cen-
tres. How does Fohat build them? He collects
the fiery dust.__ He makes bal.ls of fire, runs
through them, and round them, infusing life there-
into, then sets them into motion; some one way,
SECRET DOCTRINE 71
some the other way. They are cold, he makes
them hot. They are dry, he makes them moist.
They shine, he fans and cools them. Thus acts
Fohat from one twilight to the other, during Seven
Eternities. â¢ â¢ â¢ Make thy calculations, 1.Anoo,
if thou wouldest learn the co"ect age of the small
wheel. Its fourth spoke is our mother. Reach the
fourth "fruit" of the fourth path of knowledge that
leads to Nirvana, and thou 1halt comprehend, for
thou shalt see."
Stanza No. 7: "Behold the beginning of sen-
tient formless !ife. â¢ â¢ â¢ The one ray multi-
plies the smaller rays. Life precedes form, and life
survives the last atom of form. Through the count-
less rays proceeds the life-ray, the One, like a
thread through many jewels. â¢ â¢ â¢ The spark
hangs from the flame by the finest thread of Fohat.
It journeys through the Seven Worlds of Maya. lt
stops in the first, and is a metal and a stone; it
passes into the second and behold-a plant; the
plant whirls through seven changes and becomes
a ncred animal. From the combined attributes of
the1e, Manu, the thinker is formed.
The 7th Stanza continues the history, tracing
the descent of life down to the appearance of man,
thus ending the description of cosmic evolution as
found in the first volume.
72 BLAVATSKY AND THE
For a graphic summary of the teaching of The
Secret Doctrine on the cosmogony of the system
of worlds to which we belong, it would be diffi-
cult to improve upon that given in an old commen-
tary on the Book of Dzyan. "Eight houses were
built by Mother [Space]. Eight houses for her
Eight Divine sons [planets]; four large and four
small ones. Eight brilliant suns, according to their
age and merits. Bal-i-lu (Marrtanda) [the eighth
.<un, the sun of our solar system] was not satisfied,
though his house was the largest. He began (to
work) as the huge elephants do. He breathed
(drew in) into his stomach the vital airs of his
brothers. He sought to devour them. The lar-
ger four were far away; far, on the margin of
their kingdom (planetary system). They were not
robbed (affected) and laughed. Do your worst,
Sir, you cannot reach us, they said. But the small-
er wept. They complained to the Mother. She
exiled Bal-i-lu to the center of her Kingdom, from
whence he could not move. (Since then) he (only)
watches and threatens. He pursues them, turning
slowly around himself, they turning swiftly from
him, and he following from afar the direction in
which his brothers move on the path that.encircles
their houses. (7he sun rotates on his axis always
in the same direction in which the planets revolve
SECRET DOCTRINE 73
in their respective orbits.' astronomy teaches us).''
If there is anywhere a plainer and more graphic
exposition I should like to know it. Modern as-
tronomy also explains this phenomenon, though
in some points it differs. The occult doctrine re-
jects the hypothesis (born of the nebular theory)
that the seven great planets have evQlved from the
central mass of the sun-at least, of our visible sun.
The first condensation of cosmic matter took place
around a central nucleus, its parent sun, but ac-
cording to the occult teaching, the sun merely de-
tached itself earlier than the others, as the rotating
mass contracted, and is their elder brother and not
their father.
Each of these seven planets in its turn is again
associated with six other planets. Such a group
is called a planetary chain. Each of these chains
forms a field of evolution for a certain number of
monads or souls. There are further subdivisions,
but we need not be concerned with them here.
Evolution of these monads progresses through
a series of manifestations on one or more of these
chains, and, just as this earth is the fourth and
most material planet of the seven globes which are
the field of its special system of evolution, so does
this whole chain of worlds occupy the same place
74 BLAVATSKY AND THE
in the larger scheme to which it belongs; that is
to say, the life impulse which is now cycling
through this present period of evolution had its
beginning long anterior to it. There have been
three such periods of evolution before this one, and
there will be three after this one has passed, before
objective manifestation once more returns to the
bosom of the Infinite for a pericxi of rest.
Our own little earth and its human inhabitants
are given due consideration in the second volume
of The Secret Doctrine. To understand it is by no
means the simple task which one might suppose
when viewing the pictures representing the creation
story in some of the old cathedrals of Eur9pe,
where God appears much as a Nuremberg toy-
maker, hanging the planets in the firmament, or
sitting cross-legged on a table with a large pair of
scissors beside him, sewing coats of skin for Adam
and Eve.
We understand also that the geological consti-
tution of the earth cannot be accounted for by the
six-day or any other creation theory, for if God
created the world as thus set forth, we must also
suppose that he twisted the strata, stored the fossils
between, scooped out the valleys supposed to have
been made by glaciers, and caused the marks of
SECRET DOCTRINE 75
erosion by water all for His own glory and for the
mystification of man.
The Secret Doctrine teaches that the fire-mist
which eventually condensed into what is now our
earth originally covered an area so large that it
enveloped the moon. The latter was heated to
such an extent that it was softened to the cons~
tency of mud; its water and air were converted
into steam, and when the fire-mist contracted, the
atmosphere and water followed the new center.
When the earth had cooled sufficiently, the en-
veloping fire-mist condensed into our present water
and air, until at the time when the life-wave
reached the earth from Mars in the course of the
present round, the earth had cooled so much that
the water had become tepid. About this time, the
first of the four great continents-which existed
before the earth assumed its present topography-
appeared in the region now known as the Arctic.
CHAPTER V
II
EFORE going any farther, it is neces-
sary to understand the central position
of our earth in the whole plan of evo-
lution. During the preceding three
and one-half rounds, the monads have
been veiling themselves more and more in matter.
On the earth in our present round, the nadir of
materiality was reached by all kingdoms in the
middle of the fourth race. We, being in the fifth
sub-race of the fifth root-race, are just beginning
to slowly raise ourselves out of matter. We are the
prodigal sons who went into a far country to gather
experience, and having gone as far as we could,
are now returning home to our Father-who by
the pouring out of Intelligence has met us a long
way off, and is now conducting us to our own
spiritual home.
The general plan of human evolution on the
globe is briefly this: seven distinct root-races were
destined to evolve a certain principle or sense. In
76
SECRET DOCTRINE 77
this way, the four races which preceded us de-
veloped hearing, touch, sight, and taste. We have
developed smell. The sixth and seventh root-races
are to develop astral and mental clairvoyance re-
spectively. They will also develop spirituality. We
are developing intellectuality; our predecessors de-
veloped desire. Each of the seven root-races divides
into seven sub-races, these again being subdivided.
The evolution of each root-race takes place under
the guidance of a special teacher, a great spiritual
entity who incarnates in that race as ruler and law-
giver.
Each root-race evolves on its own continent,
which is destroyed when that evolution is finished,
water and fire being used alternately as agents.
The archaic names of these continents are many,
but to avoid confusion The Secret Doctrine uses
the names most familiar to Western'readers. The
first continent it calls the Imperishable Sacred Land.
The reason for this name is that this continent is
the only one whose destiny it is to last throughout
the whole of our stay on this chain of globes. It
was the cradle of the first man, and will be the
dwelling of the last divine mortal Chaya as a re-
pository for the future seeds of humanity.
This sacred land has in its center Mount Meru,
78 BLAVATSKY AND THE
whose roots are in the Himalayan chain; from
the peak of this sacred mountain-which forms
the axis of the earth-there is a continuous flow
of magnetic current, which spreads over the whole
globe, re-entering it at the south pole. Thence it
goes to the Holy City of Shamballah (the heart of
the earth) in the Gobi Desert, where it is purified
by the Masters of the Great White Lodge, and
sent back to Mount Meru at the north pole.
Around the sacred mountain, like leaves of the
lotus, are seven promontories. On these were born
the seven sub-classes of the first race, says the Book
of Dzyan: "The great Chohans [Lords] called the
Lords of the Moon, of the Airy bodies. 'Bring
forth men, men of your nature. Give them their
forms within. She will build coverings withoUI.
Males-females will they be.' â¢ â¢ â¢ They [the
Moon-gods] went each on his allotted land: seven
of them each on his lot."
Concerning anthropogenesis, The Secret Doc-
Jrme teaches: (1) the simultaneous evolution of
seven human groups on seven different portions
of our globe; (2) the birth of the astral body be-
fore the physical, the latter body being molded in
the astral form; (3) the priority of man in this
round to the animals, the monkeys included. This
SECRET DOCTRINE
last teaching is in accord with the second creation
story in the Bible; also with other books.
On the Sacred Imperishable Land were created
by the Lords of the Moon chain the first race--
large, shadowy, ethereal beings floating hither and
thither. It may be asked, why call them human?
For the same reason that a human fetus is called
human, when for the first eight weeks it is indis-
tinguishable from the embryonic dog. The meth-
od by which these beings reproduced was to throw
off their astral counterpart, which in time could
throw off another, each inferior to his father. This
provides the explanation of the varying stages of
humanity, for such inferior beings were ensouled
by inferior entities. This race did not die, but was
clothed with the second race. The latter, after the
type had been definitely established, was led to
what The Secret Doctrine calls the Hyperborcan
continent, the promontories of which stretched
from the North Pole to the south and west. In
the days of Homer the Greeks spoke of it as a
blessed land beyond the reach of Boreas, the god
of winter, and of the hurricane-an ideal country,
where nights were short and days were long.
On this continent lived the second-race men,
ensouled by the second great host of monads which
80 BLAVATSKY AND THE
had come over from the Moon chain. Although
having the general form of men, the individuals of
this race were gigantic jellylike creatures who float-
ed over the surface of the earth, as directed by
passing desires. The features were undefined,
there being no eyes, ears, or mouth. They received
impressions through and were guided by two cen-
ters of force, the so-called third eye (which has
become the pineal gland) and an organ which has
<leveloped into the spleen. They were potentially
bisexual, and reproduced their species in the same
manner as the first race. The second-race men
were boneless-which accounts for the fact that
geologists have found no fossils in the three lower
strata.
During the later secondary period the waters
receded, and land appeared in the areas now
covered by India, China, Australia, Africa, the
Pacific Ocean, and Northern Europe. This was
the vast Lemurian continent, to which the great
Lemurian race was led by its Teacher. This was
the first race to receive the outpouring of intelli-
gence.
The mode of reproduction was changed three
times during this period. Says the Book of Dzyan:
"Then the second [race] evolved the Egg-born, the
third. â¢ â¢ â¢ The egg of the future race, the
SECRET DOCTRINE 81
Man-swan of the later third. First male-female,
then man and woman." Today embryology teaches
that man is born from the ovum; that in the third
month the fetus is bisexual; then one sexual or-
gan becames dominant, the other remaining rudi-
mentary but never disappearing. The body of the
third root race man became firmer, and its shape
changed until it was man as we know he wa~a
giant twelve to fifteen feet tall, with a dark yellow-
brown skin, long lower jaw, flat face, eyes far apan,
the head sloping upward and backward. He had
no forehead; the hair was short, the back of the
head bare, probably for the greater convenience of
the third eye. Arms and legs were much longer in
proportion than ours. His heels projected back, so
that he could walk backward. Certainly he was not
too engaging a person. We can sympathize with
the souls who were guided to such bodies for incar-
nation, and excuse them for refusing.
During this age the animals appeared, and sep-
arated into sexes before man. Up to this stage,
man had remained (as the Book of Dzyan puts it)
"an empty, senseless shadow." Then came the
time when he was to receive the priceless gift of
mind. To acomplish this three classes of souls came
down to birth.
The first were the Lords of Venus, who,
82 . BLAVATSKY AND THE
though not belonging to our planetary chain,
sent to this earth-their adopted child-great
teachers who taught and guided infant human-
ity. To them we can give thanks for the fact
that we are now about one round in advance of
what we 9therwise would have achieved. These
Lords established the Great White Lodge, which
has existed ever since, and from which have been
:;ent all the great Teachers of humanity. Origin-
ally the Lodge was not for the benefit of evolving
humanity- which for ages was not to be qualified
to tread the path of initiation-but for those of the
Lords of Venus who had not reached the highest
~tage of initiation.
The other two classes are described as the Sons
of Wisdom and the Sons of Night. Of these the
Sons of Night refused to create. Those who en-
tered became sages; on those who did not procreate,
the curse was pronounced. They will be born m
rhe fourth suffering, and causing suffering.
Thus was a part of humanity left narrow-headed
and mindless. Of them the Book of Dzyan says:
"And those which had no spark Â·took huge she-
animal,s unto them. They begat upon them dumb
races. Dumb they were themselves. But their
tongues untied. The tongues of their progeny re-
SECRET DOCTRINE 83
mained still. Monsters they bred. A race of crook-
ed red-hair-covered monsters going on all fours.
A dumb race to keep the shame untold. Seeing
which, the Lhas [the spirits, the Sons of Wisdom]
who had not built men, wept, saying: 'The Aman-
a.sa [the mindless] have defiled our future abodes.
This is Karma [retribution]. Let us dwell in the
others. Let us teach them better, lest worse should
happen. â¢ â¢ â¢ Then all men become endowed
with Manas [mind]."
Some of the fourth race men who had mind,
however, did the same-and here is the explana-
tion of The Secret Doctrine regarding the anthro-
poids. They are not our ancestors-as is assumed
by the evolutionists-but an offshoot of the human
race. They are the only animals now on the globe
which will develop human astral forms in the
seventh root-race, and will be definitely human in
the fifth round.
There is still another class, of which one divi-
sion incarnated during the later third and the other
during the early fourth round. They had advanced
too far on the Lunar chain to be reborn on the
earthly chain during the preceding stages, and
came into incarnation for the first time on this
chain. These are the last of the monads who in-
habited the Moon chain.
84 BLAVATSKY AND THE
From the seventh sub-race of the third race the
Teacher who was to develop the coming fourth
race singled out those who were to form the nu-
cleus, and led them to that great seed-ground for
humanity-the Imperishable Sacred Land-where
he segregated them, says the Book of Dzyan, two
by two, on the seven zones, and imbedded in their
forms potentially the qualities to be developed in
the coming races. Meanwhile great cataclysms rent
the continent, and Lemuria as such disappeared,
ages before the tertiary period. In its place rose
Atlantis, the fourth continent, destined to become
the seat of a civilization which in many ways ex-
celled our own. Its rulers were divine Priest-Kings.
It was indeed the Golden Age; alchemistry was
used to produce gold for use in the arts and to
ornament their houses and buildings. Superphysi-
cal powers were a common possession.
When the divine pilots tried the experiment of
relinquishing the helm to see if man himself would
be able to guide the ship of humanity, this was all
changed. "Then the Fourth [race] became tall
1t1ith pride. We are the kings, it was said; we are
the gods. They took wives fair to look upon. Wives
from the mindless, the narrow-headed. They bred
monsters. Wicked demons, male and female. â¢ â¢
They built temples for the human body. Male and
SECRET DOCTRINE 85
female they worshipped. Then the Third Eye act-
ed no longer. They built huge cities. â¢ â¢ â¢
They built great images nine yatis high, the size
of their bodies. Inner fires had destroyed the land
of their fathers. The water threatened the fourth.
The first great waters came. They swallowed the
seven great island;." Such is the Story of the
degradation into which fell the class which the
Book calls the Lords of Night, or the Dark Faces,
in contradistinction to the Sons of Wisdom,
or Lords of the Dazzling Face. The Secret Doctrine
tells the story plainly:
"And the 'great King of the Dazzling Face,' the
chief of all the Yel/ow-faced, seeing the sins of the
Black-faced, was sad. He sent his air-vehicles to
all his brothers-chiefs (chiefs of other nations and
tribes) with pious men within, saying 'Prepare,
arise ye men of the good law, and cross the land
while (yet) dry. The Lords of the storm are ap-
proaching. Their chariots are nearing the land.
One night and two days only shall the Lords of the
Dark Face (the Sorcerers) live on this patient land.
She is doomed, and they have to descend with her.
The nether Lords of the Fires (the Gnomes and
fire Elementals) are preparing their magic Agney-
astra (fire-weapons worked by magic). â¢ â¢ â¢
They are versed in Ashtar (Vidya, the highest
86 BLAVATSKY AND THE
magical knowledge). Come and use yours (your
magic powers, in order to counteract those of the
Sorcerers). Let every lord of the Dazzling Face
(and adept of the White Magic) cause the Viwan
of every lord of the Dark Face to come into his
hands (or possession), lest any (of the Sorcerers)
shouU by its means escape from the waters, avoid
the rod of the Four, (Karmic deities) and save
his wicked (followers or people). May every yel-
low face send sleep from himself (mesmerize?) to
every black face. May even they (the Sorcerers)
avoid pain and suffering. May every man true to
the Solar Gods bind (paralyze) every man under
the lunar gods, lest he should suffer or escape his
destiny. â¢ â¢ â¢ The hour has struck, the black
night is ready, etc., etc. ' " The waters arose and
covered the valleys from one end of the earth to the
other. So perished Atlanti~ and came into being
the story of the deluge.
From the fifth sub-race of the fourth root-race,
the original Semitic, had been chosen by the Holy
Vaivaswata, the Teacher of our fifth root-race, the
families who were to be the ancestors of the coming
race. The people were turbulent, however, and
difficult to control. They frustrated the plans of
their teachers by exracial intermarriage, so they
were abandoned. From them descended the Jews.
SECRET DOCTRINE 87
This explains the Biblical statement that the Jews
are a chosen people, and that the sons of God took
wives from among the daughters of men. The
Teacher then selected about twenty-five families
which had not been contaminated, and led them
northward to the Sacred Imperishable Land, where
with loving care he instilled into them the potential
characteristics of our present humanity. When ages
had passed, he led them again southward to Cen-
tral Asia-the land which had risen in place of the
doomed Atlantis. Already the continents had tak-
en essentially the forms in which they now exist.
From Central Asia proceeded the different migra-
tions. The first sub-race, the Aryan, went south-
ward to India. The second, the Aryan Semitic,
peopled Arabia and Syria. The third, the Iranian,
led by Zarathustra, journeyed to Persia. The fourth,
the Keltic, led by Orpheus, settled in Greece,
Italy, France, Ireland, Scotland, and England.
The fifth, the Teutonic, occupied Central Europe
and is now conquering the world.
What does The Secret Doctrine say about the
future ? The land-body now known as North
America will be consumed by fire. In its place
will arise a new continent which will be the home
of a spiritual people. This will be the sixth root-
race, the nucleus of which is being evolved right
88 BLAVATSKY AND THE
here, under the Stars and Stripes. In that race,
function will be restored to the pituitary body and
the pineal gland, which have been inactive since
the degradation of the fourth race. These two
glands are not merely-as science says--two horny
warts covered by sand, but two very important
organs temporarily out of use. They are the keys
to the spiritual worlds, which will in that race be
opened to all mankind. The granules with which
these bodies are covered are absent in children un-
der seven and in congenital idiots. Weak-minded
people have but few. This race will be male-female
and the sympathetic nerve will develop into a sec-
ond spinal cord. They will be a beautiful, spiritual
and mighty people. Yet this race with its continent
will also pass away, to give place to the seventh and
last of our root-races.
The people of this last race will dwell on a land
to the south of us, there evolving to a state trans-
cending our present understanding. Mental clair-
voyance will be possessed by all; the two spinal
cords will merge into one, and man will be sexless.
Then will come the time when the life-wave will
once more leave our earth to conquer other worlds.
Such is the sublime plan to which we belong,
as outlined in the first and second volumes of The
SECRET DOCTRINE 89
Secret Doctrine. The third volume consists of a
miscellaneous collection of papers published after
the death of the author. As the years pass, the
truth of the statements in The Secret Doctrine are
being gradually vindicated. As the knowledge of
students grow, their admiration and reverence for
their great teacher becomes Qlore profound. With
but few and unimportant exceptions, everything
which is to be found in the voluminous literature
of modern occultism has been available in The Sec-
ret Doctrine ever since its publication. In the work
is food for the heart and for the intellect-a system
of thought and knowledge which, if we will but
study it and put it into our lives, can make us wise
unto salvation.
APHORISMS
FROM MAX HEINDEL'S WRITINGS
As our body is the visible garment of the in-
visible ego, so does the visible fire clothe the true
invisible fire. Fire and the ego arc both spirits
and both manifest under analagous laws.
A good memory is one that forgets the faults
of others, but remembers the lessons.
A small man is always anxious for a big position
because he feels that the position will confer dignity
and prestige upon him, but there are ninty-nine
chances that he will disgrace the position. A big
man dignifies any position, big or little, by the
efficient way he handles it.
No matter how high that ideal seems or how
far below it we feel, Saints have realized it. They
were men, and what man has done man can do
again.

92 APHORISMS BY MAX HEINDEL
THE LOST WORD-You cannot say it unless
you have first learned to live it.
PRAYER is magic incantation, but unless your
life is a prayer, you will never get the answer.
When you have set your goal, never harbor a
thought of fear or failure, but cultivate an attitude
of invincible determination to accomplish your oh-
ject despite all obstacles, holding the thought of
success constantly.
The Black Grail feeds on evil, while the Holy
Grail feeds on Love. If evil did not exist the
powers of darkness would starve.
Prayer is like the turning on of the electric
switch, that does not create the current but simply
provides a channel through which the electric cur-
rent may flow. In like manner prayer creates a
channel through which the divine life and light
may pour itself into us for our spiritual illumina-
tion.
There is but one safe way to develop our latent
faculties. No matter what anyone may say to the
contrary, experience will prove that attainment to
spiritual powers depends upon purification and un-
APHORISMS BY MAX HEINDEL 93
selfish aspiration; and that is what the mysteries
taught in olden times.
Nature is the symbolic expression of God. She
does nothing gratuitously, but there 1s a purpose
behind everything and every act.
It is one thing to go out in the mountains where
there .is no one to contradict or to jar upon our
sensibilities and keep our poise; but it is another
thing entirely to maintain our spiritual aspirations
and keep our balance in the world where every-
thing jars upon us; but when we stay on this path
we gain a self-control which is unattainable in any
other manner.
When we work and pray, and make our lives
a living prayer for opportunities to serve others,
then all earthly things will come of their own ac-
cord as we need them, and they will continue to
come according to the degree that they are used in
the service of God.
A great and wonderful allegory is written in
cosmic characters in the sky. It is also written in
our own lives, and warns us to forsake the fleeting
life of the material and to seek the eternal life of
God.
94 APHORISMS BY MAX HEINDEL
There can be no contradiction in nature, there-
fore the heart and mind must be capable of uniting.
To indicate this common ground is precisely the
purpose of this book; to show where and how the
mind, helped by the intuition of the heart, can
probe more deeply into the mysteries of being than
either could alone, where the heart by union with
the mind, can be kept from going astray, where
each can have full scope for action, neither doing
violence to the other, where both mind and heart
can be satisfied.
The Founder of the Christian Religion stated
an occult maxim when He said, "Whosoever shall
not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he
shall not enter therein." (Mark 10). All occultists
recognize the far-reaching importance of this teach-
ing of Christ, and endeavor to live it day by day.
If, having knowledge and choice, man ranges
himself on the side of good and right, he cultivates
virtue and wisdom. If he succumbs to temptation
and does wrong knowingly, he fosters vice.
In service is the only true greatness. Yet no
matter how efficiently we may serve, if we glory
in our services, that self-glory is our only reward.
APHORISMS BY MAX HEINDEL 95
It should be our aim to think little of that
which we do, to esteem ourselves as nothing, for
no matter how well we work, none of us are able
to serve God worthily even for one single day. So
HUMILITY in service should be our chief end
and aim. The more thoroughly we can attain to
that ideal, the smaller we are in our own eyes, the
greater shall we be in the sight of God.
It is always easy to get people to do big things,
where they are bolstered up by the dignity of the
position. Lots of little men can always be found to
fill the conspicuous places, for this man enjoys to
have everybody bowing before him, but it takes
a BIG MAN to do the little things, the things
which are called menial, which are not menial for
the personality dignifies the task.
No matter what people say to us or about us
their words have no intrinsic power to hurt. It is
our own mental attitude towards their utterances
which determines the effect of their words upon
us for good or ill. Paul, when facing persecution
and slander, testified that, "None of these things
moved us."
