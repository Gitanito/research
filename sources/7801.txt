  		              		Experience Description   

    I experienced a bad accident a couple months ago. I was knocked out for 24 hours and I don't remember what really happened before my accident. 

  But what I vividly remember, to this day, was going through a tunnel. I was out of my body. I could see myself lying there on the bed. Then  when I came out of the tunnel at the other end was seeing mh friend,  standing on the mountain. I didn't recognize him from the back. I thought it looked like  Trey, my best friend who was like a brother to me. He had passed over  when I was 21.  

  I called out to him saying, 'Ray is that you standing there?' 

He turned around to face me as he answered, 'Yes.'  

I said, 'Ask them why am I here? What am I doing here? Am I dead?' 

He  said, 'No you're not dead;  just somewhere else in a different  reality. 

I asked him, 'What do you mean?' 

He wouldn't answer me, only saying, 'I have something to tell you and that was whatever you do don't blame yourself for my death. It it wasn't your fault. It was my fault.' 

I think I needed that validation because ever since that day of his tragic death,  I was supposed to be with him that night and I wasn't there for him. I felt that it should have been me that night who died and not him.
