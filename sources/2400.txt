To Women — The Mothers of
Future Generations
An old maxim has it that: “The hand that rocks the
cradle rules the world.”
This is all too true, as we well know, but how has the
world been ruled? How is it being ruled today? What
is the outlook of future generations?
Are mothers themselves proud of their sovereignty?
Are they satisfied with the results of their achieve
ments?
Women rule through the men they have brought into
the world, not by being career women; not by winning
honors in social, political or national affairs.
That the world has been, is being, badly ruled, no one
will deny. In fairness to women, we must admit that this
is not wholly woman's fault. Too LONG SHE HAS BEEN
KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THE STRONGEST FORCE OF
HEAVEN AND EARTH-A FORCE THAT, ONCE IN HER
POSSESSION, WILL ENABLE HER TO RULE, PROUDLY
GLORIOUSLY, MAGNIFICENTLY. This force is CORRECT
KNOWLEDGE.
Once woman awakens to the realization that BY CARE
FULLY PLANNING AND RIGHTLY CHOOSING, PLUS
CONTINUED APPLICATION OF DESIRE AND EFFORT,
SHE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING "MENTAL GIANTS” INTO
THE WORLD, EVIL WILL DISSOLVE ITSELF AND
"SILENTLY SLINK INTO THE NIGHT.”
12 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
THIS SHALL BE WOMAN'S GREATEST HERITAGE: TO
GIVE BIRTH TO NOBLE MANHOOD-MAN FASHIONED
IN THE IMAGE AND LIKENESS OF GOD; FULFILLING
HIS SUBLIME POSSIBILITIES.
Introduction
A Perfect Baby for Every Mother-to-Be
Time was when the world was in need of men—any kind
of men. Time is now when the world is in need of real men;
choice men; strong men; honorable men; men with vision;
men who see the need of action; right action that will benefit,
not the few, but all who deserve
it,
and who are willing
to
do
all
in
their power
to
make this great, beautiful world
a
really fitting place
to
live in.
This idea
of
the need
of
real men
is
not something new;
something which we have only now begun
to
realize.
It
is
an
age-old idea; the Biblical writers were conscious
of
it
and
many
of
the world's great women-great, not because
of
birth
or
intellect, but because they had
a
glimpse
of
the
vision—dreamed
of
becoming the mothers
of
such men.
Men, thinkers, have burned the mid-night oil in their
studies, seeking ways and means
to
help women
do
what
they themselves were unable
to
do:
to
find
a
way that women
with ideals might follow and bring into the world
a
genera
tion
of
giants; giants not
in
physical strength, but
of
honor
and with the Will
to
achieve; unselfish men, strong men,
men also with vision; the vision
of
a
regenerate humanity.
In
this little text we
do
not propose
to
deal with person
alities; nevertheless we must give
a
thought
to
those who,
mostly unnamed, sought, suffered and experimented
to
find
the via dolorosa whereby women,
an
ever-increasing number,
might realize their dream
of
bringing perfect men into the
MEDICAL LIBRARY
14 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
world by means of what science knows as stirpiculture—that
is,
by
pre-conception, prenatal culture.
Towering among these men who labored, wrote text after
text and led many women
to
achieve their desire, was
P.
B.
Randolph, M.D., and
to
him
in
whose foot-steps we also
have followed, we give
all
credit.
Almost all
of
that contained herein was written
by
him,
perhaps
in
different words and terms,
by
others who also
followed him and
by
ourselves, during our fifty years
of
ex
perience. No originality whatever
is
claimed
or
pretended.
Our one thought
is
to
present
to
the millions
of
women
who seek
to
become mothers and have thus far failed,
a
simple, workable, means
of
success.
To other uncounted thousands who are not readily able
to
conceive, we offer the equally simple means whereby they
may realize their fondest dream
of
giving birth to the perfect
child; perfect physically, mentally and spiritually; this last
equally important,
if
not more so, than the perfect physique.
This can
be
accomplished
by
the double means
of
fol
lowing
a
truly natural and normal life, and
in
addition,
the active employment
by
the mother-to-be
of
her God
given creative
or
impressive ability, that
is,
impressing inner
desires upon the child-to-be. This actually amounts
to
heart
prayers
to
God,
so
strong,
so
continuous,
as
to
resemble the
printing press, which stamps
an
impression—an impression
which had
its
beginning
in
the thoughts and desires
of
man
—upon
a
blank sheet
of
prepared paper and
it
becomes
a
bank note, good
as
gold and silver
in
exchange.
The body
of
the child
in
formation
is
this blank sheet
of
paper; the life led
by
the pregnant woman
is
the preparation
of
that paper, and, lastly and greatest
of
all, her thoughts
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 15
and desires, held in heart and Soul, stamp that prepared body
with what she wishes it to become.
IN THESE FEW WORDS ARE CONTAINED THE SECRET OF
STIRPICULTURE" or PRENATAL CULTURE. It is simplicity
itself, though not so easily observed, because it is SOME
THING TO BE LIVED, NOT MERELY THOUGHT OF. But, as
in the instance cited at the end of the book, if woman really
desires a perfect child, she will be willing to “follow
through,” and she will find herself repaid a thousand-fold,
and the blessings upon her and her offspring will be untold.
The cold scientist and the materialist may laugh in scorn
at the ideas advanced; nevertheless, every stock breeder is
fully aware that there are means and methods which, if fol
lowed, perfect the breed. He is also fully aware that feed
is of primary importance to the well-being of live-stock and
that careless feeding will quickly bring undesirable results.
He knows full-well that proper housing, that
is,
environ
ment,
is
of
vital importance and, finally, that proper mating
combined with favorable impressions can produce miracu
lous results.
These facts have been proven time and again.
It
is
also
recognized
by
cold, scientific Psychologists, that though much
is
known
of
the dynamic power
of
the human mind and
Will, we have not even begun
to
sound the depth
of
its
force. Why then deny the assertion
of
those who have given
the subject life-long study and who are convinced that the
thought, Will and desire
of
the mother has the power
to
im
press her forming child with the power
of
good
or
ill?
*Stirpiculture: The Art
or
Science
of
improving
a
stock
or
the race
by
observing strict laws
of
mating, breeding, feeding; and,
in
the case
of
man
kind, the governing and directing
of
thoughts, feelings, desires and emotions.
16 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
We have in our favor, or in favor of the instructions ad
vanced, two powerful factors. These are, first of all, a science
proven by long and actual experience of those engaged in
this great work of borning a greater and more perfect hu
manity. These men base all of their conclusions on scientific
records covering a continuous period of more than an hun
dred years. We submit that there is no truer science than expe
rience.
The proof of such experiences are
all
embodied
in
the
carefully-kept records
of
these workers
in
“the Lord's vine
yard
of
a
better humanity.”
The second factor
is
of
a
material-spiritual concept.
It
is
the story
in
Genesis relative
to
Jacob and his sheep:
“And Jacob took him rods
of
green poplar, and
of
the
hazel and chestnut tree; and peeled white streaks
in
them,
and made the white appear which was
in
the rods.
“And
he
set the rods which
he
had pealed before the
flocks
in
the gutters
in
the watering troughs when the
flocks came
to
drink, that they should conceive when they
came
to
drink.
“And the flocks conceived before the rods, and BROUGHT
FORTH CATTLE RING-STREAKED, SPECKLED AND SPOT
TED.”—Genesis 30:37, 38, 39.
Yes, we are fully aware that materialism
is
on
the rampage
throughout the world, but pitted against this same mate
rialism
is
the indestructible inner spiritual feeling resident
within the hearts
of
women. Cold science cannot destroy
this, especially not
in
the hearts
of
those multitudes
of
wo
men still
so
womanly that they can dream and vision them
selves becoming the mothers
of
the perfect child.
It
is
for
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 17
these we speak; for these we prepared the instructions con
tained in this volume.
The examples of prenatal influences are cited merely to
prove the influence of the habits of life: the fact that the
thoughts and the desires of the pregnant woman may have
a powerful effect upon the future life of her child, and to
show her that it is as easy for her to bear a god in embryo
as it is to bring forth a devil. Is this statement not borne
out by the same Bible to which we have referred:
"And now the sons of men have become gods.”
How could they change their human origin into that of
becoming gods, if the foundation had not been carefully laid
in their mother's womb?
DO YOU REALLY DESIRE TO BECOME THE MOTHER OF
A PERFECT CHILD?
You, and you alone can, and must answer this question.
If this is your desire, then this volume outlines the means
and methods, simple but potent, which, if followed, will
make your dream a reality.

18 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Prenatal Culture
The Science Governing the Birth of Perfect Children
An unknown author has well written: “God gave woman
the ability and privilege to bear children so that she might
become a co-creator with Him and share the glory of
motherhood with Him.”
Another author, equally unknown, has just as truthfully
said: "A mothers' hands may be too tired to hold a torch on
high to glorify herself, but never too tired to light the candle
in the nursery.”
Prenatal culture—Stirpiculture—preparation for a child
before conception and during all of gestation—is almost as
little understood as are the laws governing creation itself.
Very few understand, or have given thought to the fact
that in a little germ or sperm—the Spermatozoon—so small
that thousands are contained in a drop of liquid and to be
seen only by the aid of a powerful microscope—is contained
the ego, the entire picture or plan of the future man. Few
mothers, or those who expect to become mothers, fully realize
that a child's education and training must begin before birth,
if it is to attain to
its
highest degree
of
mental, physical and
spiritual development.
Despite the universal lack
of
knowledge on this all-im
portant subject, the child's education, whether for good
or
*This
is
well and beautifully told
in
the many stories woven around
Mary, the mother
of
the Nazarene.
In
all history, where will you find any
man, however great
he
may have been,
or
how widely honored, who
is
so
deeply venerated
as
this mother
of
the man who manifested Godhood?
20 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
ill, began generations ago—began with the ego's beginning,
and is merely RE-commenced in the life of those who are to
become itspresent parents.
A
child is far more than something that merely grows.
Few recognize this truth and because they
do
not, suffering
comes
to
the child, and through the child,
to
the parents and
the State. Children are usually conceived with little
or
no
thought.
If
conception receives consideration
at
all,
it
is
usually with the thought of aversion, and this
is
the source
of all the evils of the world.
If
conceived despite
all
precautions, or,
to
be
fair, even
with desire, little
or
no thought
is
given
to
the new creature
prior
to
birth.
It
just grows, and may the Lord help
it
in
the
manner
of
its
growth.
The devout mother-to-be has her trust in God, but un
fortunately, this trust
in
God without preparation
on
her
part
is
much like the Biblically-frowned-upon "faith without
works” which,
as
the Biblical narrative has
it,
“is dead.”
Who
Is
Responsible for Equipping an Unborn Child
With
a
Talented Brain and
a
Perfect Body?
Humanity
as
a
whole, fathers, mothers and legislatures,
should
be
brought
to
a
high degree
of
consciousness that
a
child
is
more than something that just "grows,” “becomes,”
or
“is.” One child may
be
born with the power
to
either
destroy
or
to
regenerate
a
nation,
if
not
a
world.
Today,
as
through countless ages, the seeds which produce
*In all fairness
to
womankind generally, the blame does not rest with
them, but
is
due
to
the general ignorance
on
the subject and the lack
of
litera
ture dealing with this most-important phase
of
life.
A
recent canvass
of
var
ious libraries
in
one
of
our large cities failed
to
locate
a
single text dealing
with the problem.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 21
these children are just thrown broadcast, without preparation
of the “ground” in which they are sown; without a thought
of what they will become or what they might be; though in
some instances there is a more or less sincere trust in God.
Mankind, especially educators, priests, ministers, and those
who have the welfare of man in mind, should be willing to
give just a little serious thought to this most important of
all subjects.
Anyone having a knowledge of Divine Law should quickly
recognize that God, having given man free Will, will not
and cannot, interfere with the working out of His own Laws
for the perpetuation of the race.
Parents are responsible for: (a) properly preparing them
selves for parenthood; (b) arranging proper conditions and
environments; (c) living properly as regards rest, food,
exercise, and especially mental attitudes and emotional
stresses; (d) recognizing the fact that impressions during
pregnancy shape the destiny of offspring for the good or
ill
of
themselves and the nation as
a
whole.
It
is
seldom that
a
mother-to-be actually realizes her awful
responsibility
in
this regard.
If
she has even
a
little knowl
edge
of
the subject, just think
of
the fact that this little know
ledge may enable her
to
bring
a
highly talented Soul into the
world, instead
of
a
failure
or
ne'er do well.
It
is
necessary
to
admit with shame that prospective
mothers
by
and large, give far more thought and time
to
the
selection
of
the wardrobe for the prospective child than
to
the preparation
of
its
physical, mental and moral equipment
and character. By her LovE, EXPECTATION AND PLANNING
for the child's expectant sixty
or
eighty years
of
life, she can
perform miracles
in
the upliftment
of
mankind.
22 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
A child has the right to infinitely more than shelter, food
and clothing—selected, not actually for the child's comfort,
as a rule, but as a showpiece to display before friends and
neighbors; well and desirable in itself, but actually no more
than a side issue.
It must be generally admitted that if ever there is to be a
real reformation—the re-form-a-tion of the world; if ever
the millenium of purity, chastity, righteousness (right-ness),
and supreme peace—sometimes known as happiness—are
to be achieved on this earth, it will result from correctly—
wisely and rationally—directed parental laws.
Napoleon must have had this in mind, for he is given
credit for having said: “If you would reform the world of
its
vices and errors, begin
by
enlisting the aid
of
the mothers.”
A
Wisely Conceived Child Cannot Be Led Astray
The destiny
of
the individual, hence
of
the nation,
of
the
race itself, depends upon the mother and the prenatal condi
tions arranged for her child.
In
the propagation
of
the
species,
if
undertaken knowingly and understandingly, the
father and mother, working harmoniously
in
conjunction
one with the other, can
do
more toward fostering the reforms
so
urgently and sorely needed, than can all the temperance,
vice and reform societies, religious denominations and cor
rective (after birth) institutions
in
the world.
A
CHILD DESIRABLY CONCEIVED, WISELY NURTURED IN
THE BOSOM OF THE MOTHER-TO-BE and GUARDED BY THE
LOVE BETWEEN FATHER AND MOTHER, WILL NEVER GO
WRONG AND CANNOT BE LED ASTRAY.
If
there
is
a
God
there must
be
a
Law;
if
there
is
a
Law, then
it
certainly fol
lows that "everything
is
after
its
kind; the fruits
of
a
good
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 23
tree, well-husbanded, cannot be of a bitter nature.” If this
were not true, there would be no “God of Love,” and the
Laws governing the earth and mankind would be an illusion
and a mockery.
Woman, if true to her feminine nature, is an advance over
man; not because of her beauty, her accomplishments or the
nature of her love when correctly awakened, BUT BECAUSE
SHE POSSESSES THE WOMB, the laboratory wherein are
fashioned the millions of denizens to inhabit the world;
where she cooperates with or is an assistant to God in the
formation and final completion of a human creature.
She must be an artist, a willing assistant
if,
from
an
un
certain beginning, she
is
to
mould that new form and bring
into being
a
perfect specimen
of
the human race. Never
theless, she can
do
it,
if
she possesses the Will and the pa
tience
to
perfect the work under her care.
Pre-generation"
is
far more important than any possible
after-education. The manner
in
which children are conceived
and brought
to
birth predetermines
to
a
vast degree their
moral and immoral inclinations, talents, mental capacities,
possibilities, abilities, state
of
health and even longevity.
A
fundamental error
is
found
in
the idea that all children
are born much alike; that the only agency
in
bringing about
the difference between boy and boy, girl and girl, are the re
sult
of
application and moral effort; the direction
by
outside
influences. There
is
nothing
in
Sacred writings,
or
in
philos
ophy, sacred
or
profane,
or
in
the teachings
of
basic science,
which would indicate that God,
or
if
you prefer, the Divine
Law, holds all men responsible
in
like degree.
"Everything done
by
both parents
in
preparation for conception and all
that
is
done during the period
of
gestation.
24 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
There is no such actuality as natural equality for the very
good reason that men are not equally born—with like mental
and physical equipment—nor with like loves, hatreds, the
Will to do, or the deadly inertia not to do. Of a truth, men
are differently conceived; differently nurtured, differently
born; and, to an equal degree, differently educated and
guided.
All experiences of men, from the nurseries to the univer
sities—whether universities of formal education or practical,
hard knocks—refute such a concept. It is necessary to will
ingly, aye, gladly, acknowledge the mighty power of educa
tion and social influence in the development of the human
mind, just as it is admitted that exercise in any direction or
of any part of the body or faculty brings about development,
but, and this is uncontradictable, THERE MUST BE SOME
THING TO BE DEVELOPED; there must be a moral fibre on
which to build the moral life, the mental equipment, latent
or active, to bring a genius into manifestation.
The child born of vicious stock, irrespective of how hard
he tries, will have a most difficult task developing into a
spiritual leader governed by spiritual instincts. The environ
ments may bring about a mental revulsion or reaction and
cause such a child to become active in a manner totally con
trary to the manner of birth and the initial environment. This
we willingly acknowledge; BUT IT IS THE EXCEPTION, NOT
THE RULE. Such experiences OFFER HOPE AND ENCOUR
AGEMENT EVEN TO THOSE BORN UNDER THE MOST DE
PLORABLE CONDITIONS. The child born into a careless
shiftless family finds it far more difficult to become an Edison
or a Steinmetz, than one who sees the light of day in a well
regulated family; but the possibility of
its
super-development
does exist.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 25
Ishmael, the Symbol of Evil
The old family Bible has become a much-derided book in
this age of modernism, jazz and the decline of honor in man's
word, but we nevertheless turn to it for some of our examples.
Who, having studied that book of books, is unfamiliar
with the story of Hagar and her son Ishmael, the evil genius,
founder of the Ishmaelites, "whose hand was against every
man.” The character of the man, the manner of his life, his
every thought and act, were the visible incarnation of his
mother's, Hagar's hatred and bitterness of mind, during her
period of gestation.
During this period she was not God's assistant in the
creation of His image, but personified destructiveness; the
gall and vinegar of the human Soul, lacking even a sem
blance of the honey of love which should govern woman's
heart and Soul and temper her thoughts, desires and feelings,
during this period of life's greatest and deepest moments.
Ishmael's malicious and resentful nature and the ferocious
ness of the Ishmaelites—both his followers and progeny,
throughout the history of that nation—is an example of the
force and power of the influences released by the feelings of
the mother-to-be upon the child she carries within that in
most laboratory. It is an illustration of the manner in which
Prenatal laws operate, even though unconsciously, on the
part of the mother with the child.
Hannah–Mother of Samuel
Hannah, the mother of Samuel, offers an unusual contrast.
Who, believing there are Laws of God, Laws that govern
“Ishmael, a symbolization of resentment, bitterness and malice.
26 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
in all
things, both great and small, will believe for
a
moment
that Hannah's holy vows, vows which were the result
of
her
inward feelings, her devout piety, while she was enceinte with
Samuel—who will believe that this love
in
her heart had
nothing
to
do with Samuel's nature and the manner
of
his
life?
If
it
did not, then why make Hannah the symbol
of
piety, holiness
to
the Lord and, above all, love for the child
within her bosom? Why
is
this
so
strongly dwelt upon?
Mary—Mother
of
Jesus
Why did the Lord not select a woman
of
vicious nature,
a
neurotic,
or
an
emotionally unstable woman for the mother
of
the Nazarene, His chosen messenger
of
a
new age
to
the
people? Was not the graciousness
of
all
womenkind,
of
all
motherhood, condensed
in
Mary's one statement: “My soul
doth magnify [glorify] the Lord.”
The Self-Made Man
The familiar statement,
a
“self-made man”
is,
with few
exceptions,
a
misnomer.
If
a
man does not possess the quali
ties, received from either one
or
both parents, necessary
to
success, transmitted
to
him,
he
cannot—or perhaps more
correctly,
he
will not—rise above the characteristics
of
the
mediums
of
his birth. Certain essential characteristics must
predominate, among them: ambition, stability, concentrated
effort, and above all, Will power.
Exceptions
to
the Rule
The exceptions must
be
recognized. The life
of
the pa
rents, the environments
of
birth, and the associations, may
exert such
an
influence upon one unfortunately born,
as
to
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 27
bring about, first, resentment, and then, an iron determina
tion that he Will prove his life to be exactly the opposite
to that of his parents, contrary and greatly improved over
his early environments and associates. Wonderful improve
ments are possible when a man rebels against his condition
in life and determines to do something about
it.
Famous People Who Overcame Handicaps
The inertia
of
Lincoln's father, the kindliness
of
his
mother, brought about such
a
revolution
as
we have just
mentioned, and
a
new determination was born
in
Lincoln:
"I
will show them!” This determination was not directed
against his parents, but
to
the people
of
the community
in
general.
Napoleon was another such example, though
in
him the
selfish trait finally became manifest.
Theodore Roosevelt, born physically weak, manifested
this same power
of
the “I-will-show-them!”
These are exceptions, and
in
all
of
them, the trait
of
kind
liness,
of
physical strength,
or
of
selfishness, can
be
traced.
In
each instance the child inherited
a
general aptitude for
some special activity; the brain being fashioned
by
the
thoughts, desires and the blood
of
the mother, though
it
might also have been imbedded
in
the ego part
of
the germ
(spermatozoon) which was the beginning
of
the new crea
ture.
In
the ultimate, the “self-made” man may
be
but
an
in
dication
of
a
worked out plan (by the Law) and
a
developed
quality transmitted

the unborn infant, vide reincarna
tion; potentialities, possibilities, even certainties, all modified
or
strengthened
by
what we roughly term prenatal influence.
28 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
There are those we may rightly class as “self-made,” be
cause they had an idea and they concentrated their entire
energy and time upon bringing that idea into fulfillment,
permitting nothing to interfere in such an effort. Some of
these became great as a result of an inborn unbendable Will,
which merely required proper development. This is entirely
possible if the mental ideal is of sufficient strength.
Such men must be given full credit and may rightly be
held up as examples to those who, born weakly and un
fortunately, possess an ideal, an all-devouring desire to
achieve. Such examples afford uncontradictable proof that
all men may rise to worthwhile accomplishments, despite the
misfortunes of birth, IF THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY THE
PRICE, READY TO MAKE THE EFFORT, and continue to do
so until success crowns their activity. These, as previously
mentioned, are the exceptions and lend encouragement to
all. It is better, however, if all men are to "the manner
born,” thus better able to take their rightful place in a better
world.
Alexander the Great
Many of the world's recognized men were not in fact, as
the world supposes, self-made. Alexander-the-Great is given
credit for being one of the greatest geniuses. HE WAS
ACTUALLY BORN GREAT. His genius manifested itself at
the moment boyhood changed into manhood and he became
personally responsible.
He may be considered as the Soul of a near-genius who
required only a rebirth for his genius to become manifested,
and in this the prenatal desire of perhaps both father and
mother, or at least one of them, was demonstrated. When
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 29
but sixteen, he governed Macedonia while his father was
absent. At twenty he succeeded to the throne; then began
his career of conquest. He died at thirty-two; the flower had
turned to seed; his destiny was fulfilled.
His father, Philip II of Macedonia, was an illustrious
general and statesman, possessing a magnificent physique; a
commanding presence; eloquent of speech and wise in the
command of men. Olympias, the mother of Alexander, was
an ardent enthusiast ["Enthusiasts are the Ambassadors of
God.”—Randolph], possessing strong passion. It is but
natural that two such people should ardently desire to bring
into the world a mighty Soul. DESIRE IS A MOST POWERFUL
PRENATAL INFLUENCE, AN INFLUENCE SO GREAT THAT
LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, CAN SWAY OR TURN IT ASIDE, and
those possessed of such a desire generally live and act ac
cordingly.
Napoleon's Prenatal Influence
Referring again to Napoleon as an example: His mother
was an ardent student of History. The stories of history filled
her mind, hence governed her desires. She accompanied her
husband, not an extraordinary soldier, in the wars of Italy.
Naturally, her prayers were that her son should not be an
ordinary, but an EXTRAordinary soldier; a commander of
men.
She rode for hours daily during her pregnancy; sat by the
campfires and listened to the tales of heroism, and the plans
for battle. All of these forces played in her mind; fired her
imagination, gave birth to great imaginings for her child,
and impressed that child with all the experiences and passions
of the world of war.
30 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
In many respects, most of the truly great men resembled
their mothers in temperament and adaptability. It has been
said, and accepted as a truism, that it requires a great woman
to become a superior mother, to produce a great son. This
is actually a fallacy unless, when we say "a great woman,”
we have in mind a woman truly great because of her kindli
ness of Soul; the generosity of her spirit; the motherliness of
her heart; the feeling of compassion for all who suffer or have
been misled.
It is such as these who are truly great; not those whose
intellect competes with that of man; whose desire is for
dominion in politics or business, who seek to govern by
force instead of by love and feeling, kindliness and gracious
72e.J.J.
Only those are truly great who love deeply and unselfishly,
serve with joy; who rejoice in the mothering of men and
who, deep within their innermost being, actually feel that
woman's greatest destiny is to be, first of all, a sweetheart;
second, a good wife; third, a good housewife; fourth, a good
mother; fifth, a good grandmother, and lastly, a real com
panion to her husband when the "sowing of the fields” is
finished.
If,
for one
of
all too many reasons, she
is
unable
to
be
a
good mother, she can fulfil her destiny
by
being
a
good
sweetheart, wife, homemaker and companion.
Old fashioned? Of course, but
do
not forget,
it
was the old
fashioned women who gave the truly great men
to
the world
and not the career-women; the women who became bitter
because
of
some mistake and could not,
or
would not, re
adjust themselves.
It
remains for the truly great women,
by
proper training,
careful preparation and lofty outlook,
to
"bring forth out
of
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 31
the waters of the deep” as the old Bible would have
it,
poets,
inventors, statesmen, physicians and world leaders whose
honor, absorbed
at
the breast
of
the mother,
is
so
great
as
to
be
unmistakable and unsullyable.
The Greatest Phenomenon in All the World
The secret of
a
mother's ability
to
transmit
to
her children
any desired quality, goodness, greatness, talent, potentiality
and possibility, EVEN THOUGH THE DESIRED QUALITY
Is
NOT POSSESSED BY THE PREGNANT WOMAN,
is
the greatest
of
all the phenomena
in
the universe and
is
BASED ON HER
DESIRE AND LOVE FOR THAT WHICH SHE IS ENGAGED IN
CREATING. This
is
a
mystery only because
it
is
so
simple.
Few are willing
to
fully recognize the true facts and make
use
of
them
in
an
effort
to
bring forth beings who will re
shape and regenerate the world.
The Story
of
Four Sons
An early writer
on
the subject known
as
Zeville, gives
many case histories taken from real life. Here
is
one
of
ex
ceptional interest because
of
the variety
of
results achieved
by
a
single mother.
“A woman gave birth
to
four sons. The first
of
these was
ordinary, much after the majority
of
men. The second was
conceived after the mother had learned some of the laws
governing prenatal culture and
in
whose heart had been born
the ideal
of
an
eloquent son,
an
orator.
She interested herself
in
the lives and orations of those
truly great
in
the field; imagined herself
in
the place
of
the
mothers who had given birth
to
these men. She attended
lectures whenever possible, listened understandingly
to
great
32 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
speakers, and always HELD A DEEP DESIRE THAT HER CHILD
WOULD BECOME A GREAT ORATOR. A son was born to her,
and, nurtured by the breast wherein there dwelt, like an ever
burning light, this great desire, became a world renowned
Orator.
Her third son was to be an artist. While enceinte she
studied art whenever she had the opportunity. She visited
galleries whenever possible; she feasted her eyes on beautiful
paintings and, in her innermost thoughts, was herself an artist.
The son is (at this writing) one of the great painters in
Europe.
For her fourth son she had in mind the career of a master
architect. As with her other children, she blended her inner
self, the heart and Soul, with works of architectural beauty;
she never for a moment let go of her ideal; never had a
doubt, but that it was to be a son who would truly be
successful in the career she had mapped out for him. Her
desire was fulfilled; her dream came true.”
The Problems of Two Friends, and How They
Were Solved
Clara F. and Margaret E. were friends living in a mid
western town of some three thousand population. As is now
so frequently the case, there was no resident physician, the
Ilearest being a considerable distance away. In case of child
birth, the women depended upon midwives.
The family of Clara F. was made up of what she described
as “ordinary country people.” They were honest, intelligent
people with a country school education.
Her husband was a farmer without any great ambition.
He wanted a family as had his father before him, but there
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 33
it ended. Children were children. Some good and others not
so good, but what could one do about it?
His wife, Clara F., was different. In some manner she
had obtained literature dealing with race improvement and
the overcoming of physical and mental weaknesses in off
spring. She had become sincerely interested in the subject,
being determined that if a mother did have the destiny of
her offspring in her hands, SHE would do
all
in
her power
to
bring superior children into the world.
As she described
it,
there existed
in
her family
a
decided
physical handicap, the body structure was
of
such
a
nature
that bones would break very easily and heal slowly; the
teeth deteriorated
at
a
very early age, and there appeared
no
available remedy. Consultation with
a
dentist was difficult
and the physician" consulted could give her very little
information.
Clara
F.
did considerable reading and her desire
to
be
come the mother
of
superior children, both physically and
mentally, had been aroused
by
statements
in
a
book which
she quoted
in
her letter
to
us
asking for instructions:
“Any mother can,
if
she will, produce offspring that shall
be
superior
to
either parent,
by
avoiding all disagreeable
ness
of
whatever nature;
by
believing [active faith] she
shall and will produce
a
superior specimen
of
the race, and
by
firmly resisting discontent, anger, jealousy, hatred, and
all
evil [tendencies]—DWELLING ONLY ON THAT
WHICH
IS
TRUE, BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD.”
"This was
at
a
time when physicians generally, other than "empirics,”
knew little
of
what are now known
as
the "organic mineral elements and the
vitamins." "Empirics," physicians not governed
by
stereotyped formulas,
depended more generally on experimentation, research and experience. The
now freely acknowledged great physician, Paracelsus, was
an
empiric.
"Eulis,
by
P.
B.
Randolph, M.D., written and published
in
1874.
34 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
A second similar statement was quoted from the same
work:
"When a woman is pregnant, her whole desire should
be that of giving to the world a perfect specimen of her
maternal work, allowing nature to determine the sex;
then we shall behold no more improperly constructed
human beings on this fair earth of ours.”
She was fully aware that she would receive no active co
operation from her husband because of his plegmatic nature;
on the other hand, he was a "good” man and an equally good
husband, though in a negative sort of way. THE ENTIRE
PROBLEM WAS UP TO HER.
Clara F. was instructed to have aphysical “check-up,” which
she did, and it was found that her physical condition was
excellent with the exception of what we now know as a
deficiency in both minerals and vitamins. She was then
instructed how to prepare herself for a period of no less
than three months before pregnancy should be attempted;
eating only foods known to be decidedly rich in iodine and in
the organic mineral elements and vitamins, at that time
known to the empiric as vital elements in the food. These
instructions in every way are similar to those more com
pletely described in the back section of this book.
She faithfully followed all the instructions. In due time,
a boy was born. He was normal in every respect and de
veloped as a normal child should. Mentally, he was de
cidedly bright and, at the proper age, had a beautiful set of
teeth which required no attention whatever until he was
fifteen years of age. He became naturally interested in ath
letic sports, developed a strong physical body; mentally
became very brilliant, took honors in school and college,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 35
and is today highly successful in his profession and widely
known.
It should be needless to say that his mother, following the
Indian traditions in that section of the country, by taking
Squaw vine tea, was able to feed him at her bosom and after
weaning him, continued to supply him, as well as the rest of
her family, with the proper food.
Four more children were born to her; two boys and two
girls, neither one of whom was cursed with bone deficiency.
Each developed properly, both mentally and physically,
proving to her the absolute truthfulness of the statements
she had read and which pointed out to her the Road to
Health and Happiness.
Margaret E.
Margaret
E.,
being
a
close friend
to
Clara
F.,
had
an
entirely different problem. She had long shared her confid
ences and problems with her friend; had read the same state
ments and was fired with
a
similar ambition. She, like her
friend, was raised
in
an
ordinary country family, had little
education, very few
of
the world's blessings, but was fortunate
in
that her husband, though rather suspicious
of
“the reading
of
books,” nevertheless was anxious that his wife should have
"everything that would make her happy,” hence was willing
and agreeable
to
help her
in
every way
he
could.
In
this family there was
a
strong facial feature which was
highly disagreeable
to
both the husband and wife. Though
married several years, they had avoided bringing children
into the world for fear that these might inherit this undesir
able characteristic. Reading the positive statement that
"when
a
woman
is
pregnant, her whole desire should
be
to
36 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
give to the world a perfect specimen of her maternal work,”
and that if she did
so,
"she could produce
a
superior specimen
of
the race,” she received renewed hope and courage, then
decided she would obtain all the information available and
"follow through”
by
obeying
all
instructions.
She was instructed
in
all the general and specific informa
tion for her preparation
to
conceive. While thus preparing
herself, she was firmly instructed not
to
give any thought
to
facial features, but instead
to
obtain pictures
of
both
a
boy
and
a
girl with features such
as
she desired for her children.
She was told
to
hang these where she would see them many
times
a
day and NEVER TO FEAR DIFFERENTLY, BUT TO
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HER CHILDREN WOULD REALLY
BE SIMILAR'.
In
due time,
a
normal, healthy little girl was born
to
Margaret
E.,
its
features were different, taking somewhat
after the other features
of
the family, but
as
perfect
as
the
pictures that hung
on
the wall
of
her home. Since then, three
sons and another girl have been born
to
her, each minus the
undesired feature
of
the family.
Both Clara
F.,
and Margaret
E.,
are evidence that the
“mother
is
the sculptor capable
of
moulding the mind and
the features of her children.”
The Child's Temperament
Is
Decided Before Birth
Every child, mentally, morally, physically and even spiritu
ally,
is
the result
of
all
that has proceeded; moderated
or
intensified
by
either the wisdom
or
the ignorance; the “good
ness”
or
the carelessness,
of
the mother-to-be.
"This, the reader will recognize, follows the method practiced
by
Jacob
to
bring forth cattle such
as
he
wanted, AND BELIEVED POSSIBLE—ring
streaked, speckled and spotted.—Genesis 30: 37-39.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 37
The child's temperament, in great part, is determined be
fore it is born; may be made wholly so by the wise and under
standing mother-to-be. Even
its
possibilities and capabilities
are charted,
or
may
be
charted, long before actual conception
takes place. Irrespective
of
the training
a
child may receive
after birth, the trail has already, knowingly
or
unknowingly,
been blazed, and the tendencies toward
a
given end, unless
modified
by
careful direction and training, will
be
followed.
Goethe–the German Poet
The brilliant, successful men and women, whatever their
activities
in
life, have seldom been the result
of
education
and environments alone, but of circumstances and experi
ences, consciously
or
unconsciously directed.
It
is
said
of
Goethe, the great German poet, that
he
was
a
composite,
or
intermixture,
of
his parents.
His father was
a
well educated, proud, formal man, with
uprightness
of
spirit, much fascinated
by
beautiful women.
His mother was
of
a
happy disposition with
a
deep love and
great aptitude for telling stories. Mentally, she was
as
bril
liant
as
her husband was proud and learned. She was vain
in
dress and proud
of
her ability for correct selection. The son
was
a
“wanted” child; the characteristics
of
the parents
blended; the son inherited, and
in
his own life, blended the
qualities
of
the parents.
Buffalo Bill–Wm.
F.
Cody
“Wm.
F.
Cody, better known
as
Buffalo Bill, the hero
of
our own youth, greatly resembled his mother. He was
as
brave
as
he
was honorable. He was born during the early
days
of
Missouri, then
a
wild and ungoverned country. His
38 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
mother had need to be brave and fearless, a trait from which
honor is born.
"Early in his life, his father was assassinated, and his
mother undertook, with success, to be both father and mother
to him. Wm. F. Cody became in life the manifestation of
the experiences of his father and mother; experiences and
feelings impressed upon him during gestation, and after
birth; feelings and experiences, and the reactions upon his
mind and Soul, as the result of the life lived with his father
and mother.”
Mary, Queen of Scots
An adverse illustration is that of Mary, Queen of the Scots.
Before the birth of her son, who became James I, of England,
she witnessed the plunging of steel into the heart of her
secretary, and, what was even more unnerving, she was
forced to listen to the wild ravings of his ignoble fear of
death and who, bathed in his own blood, clung to her skirts
for the protection he did not receive.
Her son, King James, never knew such a thing as tran
quility. He was filled with conflicting emotions; inordinately
timid, fainting even at the sight of blood; a tyrant and vin
dictive, as have ever been moral and physical cowards.
The horrible impressions upon the mind and heart of the
pregnant woman became the pattern of an ignoble king;
a man guilty in fact but not intent; because his destiny was
shaped for him; the pattern drawn, before his mind possessed
conscious ideas of his own.
The often repeated claim that environment, one's sur
roundings, are alone responsible for the difference in the life
and actions of men is mostly a fallacy. It is admittedly
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 39
true that the influences of environment are constantly at
work from the moment of conception. These influences can
be vastly modified for good or
ill
by
the pregnant woman,
and these influences
of
environment prove the Law govern
ing Heredity, rather than otherwise.
The Law
of
Heredity
Heredity
is
the force
or
power which stamps upon the
child
a
certain picture
of
being, and apparently foreordains
that the child-in-the-making shall
be
in
the likeness, and
of
the nature,
of
one
or
the other,
or
both the parents. The force
of
Heredity and prenatalism fixes the natural bent
of
the
inner inclinations; education and environment develop this;
the two together determine the capabilities and possibilities
of
man UNLESS modified
or
accentuated
by
the conscious and
determined effort
of
the mother, with
or
without, the co
operation
of
the father.
Heredity
is
the mysteriously operating law which fore
ordains that the offspring shall
be
in
the likeness
of
one,
both,
or
a
mixture
of
the parents. This
is
true
in
the animal
world where there
is
no
modifying influence;
no
law appli
cable
to
retard
or
advance the traits, shapes
or
tempers.
Heredity and prenatalism
fix
the
natural bent
or
tendency.
in
man-to-be; education and direction, plus environments,
develop these traits
or
leanings; the two determining the
possibilities
of
man. The Will, feeling, desire and active
effort,
on
the part
of
the pregnant woman, may completely
reverse heredity and natural tendencies, not
to
mention future
J
possibilities.
Heredity,
in
so
far
as
man
is
concerned, and we have only
man
in
mind, has been made synonymous with fatalism,
40 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
feeble-mindedness, insanity and viciousness. Admittedly, in
the animal man, and unmodified, that
is,
heredity permitted
full sway, would
so
result, but the mind
of
man, aided and
abetted
by
true desire—that
of
heart and Soul—is capable
of
redirecting all the Laws
of
heredity and environment. This
we know
as
Prenatal Culture.
If
this were not true, then man would indeed
be
the play
thing
of
vicious, inhuman, unfeeling nature and not
in
any
way responsible
to
Law or God for what
he
is
or
does.
Foolishly and illogically enough, the evils
of
man are ac
cepted
as
the result
of
heredity, while the possession
of
virtue, morality, honorableness, graciousness, and even genius,
are attributed
to
other and generally unknown influences.
What utter nonsense and senselessness!
The potential influences
of
heredity may begin even be
fore the union
of
the two cells, the spermatozoon
of
the
male and the ovum
of
the female. The beginning
of
a
new
creation may
be
either animal
or
spiritual,
or
a
balance
of
both.
In
the spermatozoon
is
the picture, the architectural
drawing
of
the new being;
be
it
a
future Nazarene
or
a
Hitler;
in
it
also
is
imbedded the latency
of
tuberculosis,
insanity, deformity; the genius
or
the Christos. But the spirit
of
the Christos may
be
turned into that
of
a
satan
or
a
modern
Stalin; that
of
a
potential inhuman beast into
a
Saint—all
by
the inner love and desire
of
the woman that will mold the
body, and build virtue
or
vice into the mind. She
it
is
who
has the power
to
neutralize the virus
of
disease into the
virility
of
powerful manhood
or
womanhood.
The minute speck we know
as
a
spermatozoon
is,
in
embryo,
an
individual who will,
in
time and space, become
either
a
success
or
a
failure; temperate
or
a
sodden drunkard;
chaste and honorable
or
one given
to
license; depending
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 41
(almost altogether on the influences and the efforts brought
to bear upon it by various means, both mental and physical,
)
by the “moulder of the clay,” the mother-to-be.
\ The unappreciated fact, aye, wonder, to be considered is
that two almost unperceivable cells can contain within their
infinitesimal selves and convey from parents to child, not
alone the racial peculiarities, but also the individual traits,
weaknesses and strength of the one or both parents, as well
as trace characteristics of generations before them.
“Breed Is Stronger Than Pasture”
George Eliot made the cryptic remark that "Breed is
stronger than pasture.” Heredity is admittedly a powerful
influence in the life of man, but, well understood and cor
rectly directed, prenatalism is all-potent to neutralize or offset
the influences other than racial characteristics. Even these
may be greatly modified.
In the animal kingdom, heredity all but completely gov
erns and, in general, that
is,
in
all
but the exception, like pro
duces like. But—is this true
in
the human family?
If
it
is,
how can you explain the differences
so
very marked within
the same family?
Do we not frequently find one child
of
sunny disposition
and altogether lovable; while the other
is
morose and even
cruel, perhaps,
at
heart,
a
criminal?
Environment
is
unable
to
offer
an
explanation here, since
the environment
of
both
is
identical; both
of
the same par
ents, born
in
the same house, under identical conditions,
WITHOUT GREAT EXCEPTION, THE MOOD, THE INCLINA
TION, THE FEELING AND THE DESIRE OF THE MOTHER
BEING THE GOVERNING FACTOR.
42 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Heredity and prenatalism offer a key to the difference.
Patient investigation would quickly prove this to be a fact.
Why Is There So Much Evil in the World?
Why is there so much of the commonplace in the world?
So much of the base and cruel? So much of the vicious and
dishonorable? In reverse, so little of the beautiful and
spiritual; of inner spiritual humility and native graciousness;
so little of lovely kindliness and true fineness of human
nature?
This question can be reversed and continued: Why are
there so few really wanted children born into the world?
Children, during gestation, should have all of the human
warmth and the heart's love poured constantly over the de
weloping embryo, like, if you will permit the homely com
parison, the REALLY GOOD COOK BASTES THE ROASTS IN
HER OVEN AND PROVES BY THE RESULTS ACHIEVED, THAT
SHE is A GOOD COOK.
It is not stretching the truth to say that hardly one out of
every ten thousand children is conceived with "plan and
desire aforethought.” The others, that vast army of the un
wanted are an "accident,” each the result of a moment of
seeking satisfaction of physical passion, often induced by an
inflamed ovary or congested prostate. An ugly statement,
but a truth with which all physicians are familiar. How can
such a conception result in physical, mental and moral sound
ness and spiritual greatness?
Unfortunately, for Humanity as a whole—and this deeply
concerns each and every one almost as much as though it
WERE IN OUR OWN HOUSEHOLD-the remaining nine
thousand, nine hundred and ninety and nine are accursed with
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 43
the gross accumulations of the sins, weaknesses and vices of
the parents, who, themselves, because of IGNORANCE OF THE
RIGHT WAY OUT, are weighted down to earth, wholly earthly,
and who recoil with a sense of dissatisfaction, if not with
downright antipathy, at the very thought of being plagued
with an unwanted child. Thus, the coming of one of God's
little ones to
all
too many households
is
looked forward
to
with dread and doleful apprehension instead
of
what might
be: THE ANTICIPATION OF
A
TRULY BLESSED EVENT, THE
OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING TO MANKIND AND THE WORLD
A
TALENTED SOUL TO HELP AND GUIDE HUMANITY TO
A
GREATER DESTINY.
With this certainty
of
actualities
in
mind,
is
it
any wonder
that we find
so
much weakness, sickness, suffering, vicious
ness, drunkenness, licentiousness, murder and rape among
all classes?
Is
it
to
be wondered
at
that we find so little of
actual purity, chastity, manhood and womanhood, honor
and that little understood but much-wanted generosity and
graciousness
of
heart and Soul?
This treatise
is
prepared for those who up
to
now, have
not believed
in
Prenatal preparation,
or
the influence
of
heredity and who possibly have little faith
in
God
or
an
absolute governing law.
It
is
hoped that
all
these will be
reminded rather pointedly
of
the ever-increasing number
of
institutions for either the training
or
imprisonment
of
the
children who cannot be controlled
in
the home.
Most
of
these children were born with—as part
of
their
make-up—the propensity
to
lie, steal
or
kill;
or
lean toward
degrading practices and viciousness, all too ready
to
manifest
themselves
at
the slightest provocation. These, now number
ing into the millions, are naturally criminal. They have not
learned
of
the world
of
evil
by
contact. Many
of
them have
44 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
never been away from the farm, have lived in small com
munities, or remote places before being incarcerated in these
institutions.
No Such a Thing as Chance
It is necessary TO BE POSITIVE, and to realize that there
is no such thing as chance in the life of man from the cradle
to the grave. GoD's LAW is.
IT
IS
EVER PRESENT AND CON
TINUALLY OPERATING. IT
IS
AS CHANGELESS AS
IS
THE
COURSE OF THE SUN. Were this not true, then there would
be neither God nor law. This law is active from the birth
of
the lowest
to
the highest form
of
life,
as
implied
in
the crea
tion of "EVERYTHING AFTER ITS KIND.”
Another way
of
saying this
is
to
positively assert: "Every
thing according
to
its
nature.” The fig tree does not produce
acorns; nor the apple tree, plums. Everywhere there
is
law;
but man
in
his blindness either does not recognize its opera
tion,
or
fools himself
by
believing that the Law can
be
circumvented or set aside.
The non-observance
of
Law, whether
as
the result
of
ig
norance
or
defiance, enforces upon
its
violators the penalty
of
weakness and sickness;
as
well
as
mediocre
or
even crim
inal offspring. Observance
of
law, not merely
in
letter,
BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW and with LOVING OBEDI
ENCE FOUNDED ON THE HEART's DESIRE, clothes the new
born with the cloak
of
near perfection
of
form, feature,
mentality and the possibility
of
achievement.
At present, the Divine Command "to multiply,” the con
ception
of
children, with rare exception,
IS
NOT FULFILLED
UNDER THE LAW-is mostly without the observance
of
a
single principle
of
the Law. There
is

BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 45
table, neither desire nor plan for a child. There is not even
a thought of preparation for body, mind and Soul by either
parent. All is left to chance, and, as is often the case with
games of chance, the dice are loaded.
The birth of a truly “love-child”
is,
indeed, rare. More
often than not, the term
is
applied
in
derision
to
the child
born out
of
wedlock—the so-called illegitimate child; but
deny
it
as
men will, these children are usually the superior
children both
in
mind and body and,
as
history proves, have
achieved the greatest success. This
is
not
a
plea for the birth
of
illegitimate children, but
Is
a
slur on the millions
of
legally wedded fathers and mothers whose progeny are in
ferior. At this point we may well ask mothers, the world
over, the question: “How many of your children were con
ceived
in
affection and brought forth into the world with
rejoicing?”
We need not wait for the answer
to
this question. The
answer
is
all too plainly manifested
in
the ever-increasing
number
of
the lame, the halt, the blind, the dumb, the idiotic,
the drunken, the degenerate and the vicious; all
of
them
suffering because,
in
most instances, their parents made them
what they are through disregard
or
ignorance
of
the Creative
Law.
What Manner
of
Child
Is
Desired?
It
is
well
to
ask prospective mothers
in
all sincerity and
kindness: WHAT MANNER OF CHILD WOULD YOU GIVE
BIRTH To? Answer that question and there follows another,
just
as
disquieting: Are you possessed
of
a
conscience that
may suffer from self-accusation?
IF
YOU HAVE—USE IT!
Accept the statement
as
an
uncontradictable, irrefutable fact,
that all the missionaries
in
the world, all the reform societies
46 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
and all the human aid societies cannot do as much during
your lifetime to bring a savior into the world to help human
ity, as can one mother during her nine months of prenatal
effort, when she works in harmony with the law, in wise
desire and loving effort.
There can be no denial that the mother during the silence
of the night of nine months builds the “house not made with
hands,” which a Soul is to inhabit and that, unless modified
by her desires and efforts, this body will take on the contour
of either of the parents or an intermixture of both. This is
demonstrated by Mendel's Law. If science admits this, and it
does, and hence if physical heredity is beyond dispute, why
should there be any room for doubt that there is also a Law
governing mental and moral heredity? The mother can, if
she will, control the building of the brain cells as surely as
she can the body cells. The brain structure, determines the
child's ability, or the lack of ability.
The positive statement is repeatedly made so far to impress
all who run and read, that tendencies which might be or
would be, inherited, can be greatly modified, and in many
instances, completely changed, by the feelings and desires of
the mother-to-be during her pregnancy. Under this Law
it is entirely possible that a heart-reformed Magdalene can
become the mother of a Saint.
The child born to ordinary parents may, by force of the
Will power of the mother, based on desire and affection,
be converted into a great and lofty Soul or a genius. How
sorrowful, then, for women endowed with intellect and
culture, and the power of choice, to bring into the world a
mentally small, physically puny, miserable, unfit, feeble child!
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 47
Dr. Randolph was correct when he so positively stated
that: "Every breath should be a protest against the hor
rible injustice of casting a human being into the world
with barely enough of the fires of life to keep it from
going out, because most human reproduction is the result
of pure, unadulterated selfishness or downright base passion.
"The human race, up to the present, almost as a whole,
springs from the indulgence of individual pleasure WITH
OUT THE SHADOW OF A THOUGHT OF THE RESULTS OF
SUCH PLEASURE.”
Most humans, unfortunately for themselves and the world
as a whole, are the "accidents of passion.” Such offspring
pay the penalty; but worst of all, man continues blindly to
follow in the footsteps of his progenitors, giving as little
thought to the Laws underlying proper procreative methods
as did they.
Three Important Periods
For the guidance of those sincerely interested, the period
during which the mother-to-be may transmit influences to her
offspring has been divided into three divisions:
1. Preparatory period.
2. Gestatory period.
3. The nursing period.
In a brief treatise of this nature, it is impossible to give
even a condensed consideration to states and conditions of
periods before marriage.” Among these states and afflictions
"See Race Regeneration; The Mystery of Sex and Eulis, both books by
Philosophical Publishing Company, Quakertown, Penna. The first of these is
now obtainable in English, Spanish and Portugese languages.
48 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
are the hereditary taints of cancer, consumption, syphilis,
insanity, mental states which develop into imbecility, the
epileptic, the would-be suicide, the pathological drunkard
and the degenerate, all of them marrying and “given in
marriage.” What present known factor is there to prevent
the gradual extermination of humanity; more especially that
portion that would be worth saving—the same portion?
Man learns his lessons slowly and painfully, and frequently
only as the result of loss or suffering, or by being brought
face to face with unpleasant facts such as will shock him into
a realization of his mental imbecility. Improvement of the
human race is one of the most important subjects that can
engage man's consideration. But what has man done? Has
he not given to it the least thought of all subjects clamoring
for his attention? Instead of becoming a co-creator with God
and helping to create man in “His [God's] own image,” he
has ignored human creation entirely, but has given attention
to animal husbandry, taking real pride in winning prizes for
new or better stock.
What breeder of stock would be so utterly foolish as to
select animals weak and diseased, and with numerous faults,
to parent either new stock, or stock with which to “lord it
over other breeders” through the winning of prizes? Is it not
a foregone conclusion, by anyone who has given the matter
any thought, that he will select his choicest horses or cattle
in his attempt to outclass other breeders? Is he not likely
to exercise the most meticulous care in feeding and rearing
these prize animals? MosT CERTAINLY! But, strangely
enough, where his offspring are concerned, there is not a
care, not a thought, not even any indication of a desire that
they be superior. WHAT A TRAVESTY ON THE MOST SUB
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 49
LIME RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES VOUCHSAFED TO MAN
THAT OF "BRINGING FORTH” A SUPERIOR RACE!
Preparatory Period
If at
all
possible, the preparatory period should extend over
several months,
or
even
a
year. This period should, first
of
all,
be
governed
by
a
keen desire for what
is
to
be;
of
care
ful thought and planning. Every thought, desire and act
should
be
as
carefully scrutinized
as
when one
is
selecting
material for the building
of
a
beautiful home, only more
carefully.
Everything that
is
undesirable, everything that will not
contribute
to
the welfare or benefit
of
the mother-to-be and
her maternal progeny should
be
eliminated. This includes
alcoholic drinks, tobacco, foods and liquids not conducive
to
her health and well-being; unsavory stories
or
conversation;
profanity;
in
short, everything that
is
detrimental
to
the body
or
degrading
to
the mind and finer feelings. These should
be
sacrificed, without exception, because all
of
them will have
a
profound influence upon the ego
in
the ovum which
is
togive
life
to
the seed.
The Secret
of
Creating Superior Children
Careful thought and mature discussions should
be
adopted
by
the prospective parents
as
a
means
of
determining the
qualities, characteristics and habits they wish
to
transmit
to
their offspring.
If
such qualities are not
a
part
of
themselves,
they must
be
built into the ego
by
desire and Will and
in
that manner made
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
though they be
longed
to
the parents. THIS
IS
THE VITAL SECRET FOR THE
50 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
CREATION OF SUPERIOR CHILDREN. If, as an instance, as
so often is the case, one is given to untruths—not vicious,
but, nevertheless, inclined to stray from the facts, -this must
be brought within reason.
All too many parents debase the unborn child's nature
by falsehoods continually voiced with the solemnness of
truth. Later, these same parents bewail untruthfulness in the
child, wondering by what means, or in what manner, the
child could have developed into such a profound prevari
CatOr.
This weakness of untruthfulness in the parents is a trait
that may readily be transmitted to the child in embryo. When
one or the other of the parents is given to fibbing, every state
ment should be carefully considered before it is given voice
until the weakness is overcome. This way of overcoming un
desirable traits must be followed in every respect, whether
these take the form of nursing feelings of hatred, malice,
resentment, selfishness, or any other ignoble quality. Every
trait, whether noble or ignoble, is transmittable to the unborn
child. REMEMBER: The fruit of the tree is after the nature
of the tree.
An Accursed Son Is Born
As an example, here is an instance of the manner in which
undesirable attributes in parents combine to produce crim
inal-mindedness in the offspring.
In this case the father was large of build, strong of mind,
wilful, headstrong and positive. He was not given to any
grave sins, was considered a moral man although stubborn
and unforgiving of an injury. Aggressive, opinionated, he
considered his family, church, and his politics as the only
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 51
right ones. There was neither thought nor intent in his mind
to commit a wrong or a crime—he was, in short, a moral man.
The wife, a genuinely good-natured woman, but possessed
of a violent temper that erupted at the slightest provocation,
and just as quickly subsided, leaving her mentally depleted.
To this union was born a child—a boy, and in this boy were
united the strong, positive, unforgiving nature of the father
and the quick, explosive temper of the mother, without the
slightest tendency in his nature toward tenderness, compas
sion or forgiveness. The result was a cold, calculating nature;
a criminal tendency with complete lack of control.
At nine years of age, he was placed in an institution; at
nineteen he almost killed a man and was placed in a
State's prison. Friends were puzzled and wondered greatly
why such upright, moral parents should be accursed with
such a wayward son.
Was the son actually to blame?
The reader can doubtless call to mind the well-known
Biblical statement: “Evil must come into the world, but
woe unto him through whom it cometh.”
How many who think themselves guiltless are actually
free from this stigma, even though not consciously guilty?
Carelessness—Lack of Order
If one or both of the parents in preparing for a child,
lack order or system, corresponding penalties will be im
posed by law and nature. It is therefore of the utmost
importance that during this period of preparation every
effort be made to cultivate neatness, system and orderliness.
This effort should be continued throughout the entire period
of gestation until it becomes a fixed habit. Order—and let
52 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
us not for a moment forget this, is THE FIRST LAW OF NA
TURE. ORDER IS HEAVEN's FIRST LAW. Order is the bridge
leading into heaven; into the haven of peace and self-satis
faction. Order of thought, action; orderliness in appearance
of person and surroundings; constitute the first step toward
success in any endeavor; whether this be the creation and
bringing into being of a child, or of a new universe.
Commercial Traits
A sane and sensible commercial trait should be cultivated.
Money should be recognized as something to exchange. There
should be saving where practical, but never hoarding.
All plans should be made with the thought of saving money
intelligently but never at the expense of quality. Whatever
money must be spent should be spent cheerfully and with
full satisfaction; NEVER with a thought of regret.
Nothing must be done in a miserly spirit or with a feeling
of resentment that others possess more abundantly than we.
Neither should one harbor a desire to possess the things be
longing to others. Rather, we should cultivate the feeling
that it would be well to possess things of a like nature with
perfect readiness and willingness to make an effort to earn
them. Such a feeling is both legitimate and desirable and
builds into the brain cells and possessive nature the desire to
labor and achieve.
Another Personal Experience
A case in point: We had known Mrs.
S.,
very well, for
a
long period
of
time and our association with her had always
been very pleasant. She was not
a
cultured woman
in
any
sense
of
the term. Born
of
common, ordinary, even mediocre,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 53
but honest parents, she had little education; was barely able
to read, but possessed a heart of gold, an all-inclusive affec
tional nature, and a deep sympathy for every suffering
Creature.
She was married to a man who was much the opposite
of herself: cold, critical, unfeeling, with little affection and
of a positive nature—even cruel at times. He had little belief
in God and it is questionable whether he recognized any law
except his own desires. It is certain that, to him, “nature was
nature,” and sex was for one purpose only. As for such a
thing as prenatal culture, that was just plain foolishness, a
lot of prattle and nonsense for the weak-minded. Added to
his other undesirable qualities, he was cruelly abusive at
times.
Mrs. S. became pregnant and, despite the fact that she
was shown little affection by her husband, actually rejoiced
in the fact that she was to become a mother and one would
frequently hear her hum some homely folk-tune while she
went about her household duties.
To us, who knew her well, there was nothing, except her
own affectional nature, and the fact that she was happy to
be with child, that could possibly have been, in any sense,
favorable for the child. However, during her entire period
of gestation she did not once permit herself to be perturbed
by conditions about her, by the sacrifices—and they were
many—she was forced to make, the affections which were
refused her, but lived in the thought and anticipation of her
coming child.
She lived normally as to food, had plenty of exercise doing
her daily tasks, but lacked pleasurable recreation. IT MIGHT
BE SAID IN TRUTH THAT, DENIED ALL THE AFFECTIONS A
54 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
WOMAN CRAVES, SHE LIVED WITHIN HERSELF AND WITH
THE EXPECTATION OF BECOMING THE MOTHER OF A NOR
MAL, HEALTHY and—CERTAINLY, ON HER PART-A DE
SIRABLE CHILD.
A boy was born. He was affectionate, positive and gentle.
He worshipped his mother, respected, but feared, his father.
He grew to manhood with deep respect for law and order;
engaged in the work of reconstruction and today is known
the world over.
This mother did not possess sufficient prenatal knowledge
to even give a thought to what she wanted her son to be.
All she knew was that she wanted the child. She gave this
child all her silent affection; nurtured him at her bosom, and
through this inborn affection CHARTED HIS COURSE. To
her it did not matter what his business or profession might
be, all she wanted WAS A LOVING SON; and her constant,
silent, inward prayers were answered.
The Experience of A Different Type
Mrs. T. was of an entirely different type. She became a
patient during the early years of our practice and at a time
when Dr. Randolph was our hero, his books a text second
only to the Bible. That is to say, in modern parlance, we were
completely "sold” on his ideas.
Mrs. T. was a strong-minded, strong-willed woman. She
was somewhat embittered and her affections almost entirely
suppressed for the reason that she had married a man younger
than herself, a man well-born but weak-willed.
There was little doubt he loved his wife, but was actually
afraid to permit his feelings to manifest themselves in her
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 55
presence, though in fact, and wholly unknown to him, this
was what she most wanted.
Their “love-embraces” were naturally sporadic and with
out display of affection. She became pregnant and now, more
than ever, despised her husband, failing to recognize that a
little display of affection on her part would have at once
called into play
all
the affection for her which the husband
repressed.
When we first saw her she was bitter with the strong
inclination
to
avoid motherhood
if
possible. Here was
an
instance wholly unfavorable
to
the unborn child.
Shortly after her pregnancy she felt that she could not,
in
her own words, “bear
it
any longer.” She came
to
us
for
sympathy and advice. The entire problem was discussed and
we pointed out
to
her that unfavorable for the child
as
the
entire situation appeared
to
be,
it
was in her power
to
give
birth
to
a
perfect child, physically, mentally and spiritually,
as
perfect
as
any child ever born,
if
she were willing
to
follow
instructions
to
the letter and
in
the proper spirit.
She agreed
to
do
this and we proceeded
to
explain
to
her
that her strong-mindedness filled her husband with fear
of
her, that this wilfulness
on
her part was actually
a
masculine
trait and that, during her pregnancy,
at
least,
it
should
be
replaced
by
affection; even for her despised husband, and
certainly for the child
to
which she was
to
give birth.
She was told that all the affection she had suppressed, and
which caused her
to
have these bitter feelings, should now
find
an
outlet
in
her feelings for the forthcoming child. She
proceeded
to
make these changes within herself.
Almost unconsciously, and certainly imperceptibly, her
husband was drawn
to
her; and his own affections,
so
long
56 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
repressed, were at first timidly conveyed to her and then the
child. Peace and understanding followed; the child was wel
comed almost as a saviour and, after maturity, became
renowned in his chosen field of activity. His name, if men
tioned, would be known to most of our readers.
Love was here born out of resentment and bitterness.
Success was achieved in the face of conditions that had all
the indications of failure. In this instance, as in the former,
the mother, before pregnancy, and later, when with child,
had not even a thought of what her child was to be; all she
wanted, was to become the mother of a real man, or an ideal
200772472.
What Trade or Profession for the Unborn Child?
Undoubtedly, a vital question in the minds of most married
couples who are to become parents, or plan to do so,
is:
What trade
or
profession shall we select for the child? Shall
it
be
that
of
a
merchant, diplomat, author, musician, chemist,
architect, minister
or
priest, physician
or
lawyer,
or
shall
it
be
a
farmer
to
help feed the world?
Admittedly this
is
a
most difficult and perplexing prob
lem; especially
so
because there can
be
no
certainty whether
the child will
be
male
or
female. This uncertainty being
a
fact, the fundamental desire should
be
for true greatness
in
the child, irrespective
of
its
sex.
This "greatness” includes
all
the noble and desirable quali--
ties men and women should, and can possess. ONE THING
Is
A
CERTAINTY, THE MOTHER-TO-BE MUST feel WITHIN
HERSELF ALL OF THE NOBLE EMOTIONS AND THE DE
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 57
SIRABLE QUALITIES SHE DESIRES HER OFF-SPRING TO POS
SESS. This is the key to greatness in her children.
The ordinary and commonplace in a woman cannot pro
duce the extraordinary in her children. However, another
fact equally true is this: the mother need not actually possess
any of the knowledge she would wish to convey to her off
spring; nor is it necessary that she be in actual possession of
any of the great, noble virtues she envisions for her unborn
child. She is able to transmit and convey these attributes and
talents to the child if she will but learn to feel and to desire
these things to be part of the birthright of the child-to-be.
IMAGINATION IS FAR GREATER THAN POSSESSION. With
out the imagination awakened in man's mind, men, and
women too, would still be living in caves and caverns.
A powerful imagination, because based on the strongest of
all
emotions—love—can almost unbelievably influence
the unborn child being nurtured within the woman's
bosom. LET US NOT FOR
A
MOMENT FORGET THIS.
To
be
more specific,
let
us
suppose that the parents-to-be
desire their child
to
be
an
inventor, although they themselves,
know nothing whatever about inventions. They may, by
study, thought and desire, cultivate the requirements
of
an
inventive genius. They can, and should, affirm, believingly,
that the child
is
developing
a
brain capable
of
inventing
wonderful and useful things for the future. They should go
further than this, and make
a
realistic study
of
treatises on in
ventions and allied subjects, read the biographies
of
inven
tors, and
if
possible, attend lectures
on
the subject
of
inven
tionS.
58 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
An Edison was not a mere incident; many more Edisons
are yet to be born. Moreover, the term "inventor or invent
ing” is a generic one. Everything new, in whatever avenue of
the activities of life, is actually an “invention.” One cannot
go wrong in working along the lines suggested—and the
possibilities are unlimited.
Nature Cannot Impart a New Talent After Birth
If at all possible, parents should work in harmony with
each other during the period of gestation. They should agree
on one certain idea or desire, and having proceeded thus far,
plan carefully what the child is to be; fully comprehending
this one great Law: NATURE CAN NEVER INSERT, SUPPLE
MENT OR ADD TO, A QUALITY OR A TALENT, AFTER BIRTH.
The process of bringing into the world children of a desired
type, whatever the classification may be, is DEPENDENT
UPON TRYING, WITH THE WHOLE MIND (DESIRE) AND
SOUL (FEELING) during the months of gestation. First, the
imagination must be brought into activity in forming the
ideal of the child-to-be. Imagination in turn gives way to
desire and desire is followed by effort, EFFORT BRINGs INTo
FRUITION AND MANIFESTATION THE RESULT FIRST IMAG
INED AND THEN DESIRED.
Mozart Heard the Music of the Spheres
The mother of a Mozart is required to possess two dis
tinctive qualities: (a) a true, deep, sincere love for music at
its
best; for the music which
is
not altogether
of
this world,
but "out
of
the spheres;” (b)
be
of
a
religious nature; not
merely subscribing
to
a
formal belief
in
God, but inspired
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 59
by a feeling that is deeper than belief or faith; something that
is.
Why?
Because
of
the all-important fact: although Mozart
"wrote” music,
or
composed music,
he
did far more than this;
he
would
sit
silently and listen; and,
as
he
listened with
a
keen sense
ofdevotional peace that drowned out all exterior
sounds,
he
would “hear” the music from the spheres; and,
hearing, would write down the notes
as
he
heard them.
To transmit these qualities
or
talents
it
was necessary for
the mother
to
envisage them, and personify them,
in
her daily
life. These qualities being active within her, developed the
brain
of
the growing child within her bosom
so
that
he
would
be
born with these faculties. LOVE, WHICH
IS
DESIRE IN ITS
HIGHEST FORM,
is
truthfully said
to
be
able
to
"OVERCOME
ALL THINGS.”
IF
LOVE
IS
GOD, OR GOD
IS
LOVE, then we will readily
be
able
to
understand that there
is
no limit to what can be
accomplished
if
undertaken
in
love; and what greater love
can there be than that
of
a
mother for her child, born
or
unborn.
It
is
unquestionably true that the majority
of
the parents
of
the greatest men and women the world has ever known
were not themselves renowned for the qualities their children
displayed. They simply,
as
the result
of
the operation
of
the
absolute law, consciously
or
unconsciously, projected these
qualities into their offspring.
It
is
certain, however, that men
of
genius are almost invariably born
of
parents who possessed
markedly strong characters along some one direction,
or
who,
as
a
result
of
deprivations
or
suffering, developed some
60 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
special desire so strong as to almost completely dominate
their thoughts or inclinations along some one direction.
True, genius has been generally considered as abnormal
because many of the men whom the world considered as
geniuses were actually more or less off balance; subject to
hallucinations, epilepsy, some slight form of insanity or
chronic morbidity; hence genius has been considered unde
sirable despite the Edisons and Steinmetzes.
In these instances where morbidities were present, who is
there competent to prove that genius developed because of
either physical or mental illness? On the contrary, it is en
tirely probable that they inherited both the genius and the
ailment, whether mental or physical. Were we to limit
genius to those suffering from some form of mental or phys
ical abnormality, we would thereby limit God and we know
that even puny man is limited only to the degree that he
limits HIMSELF.
The Randolphian Concept
The sexive principle and instinct in the human creature
is in practically every respect diametrically opposite from
that in the non-human kingdom. To obtain the proper con
cept of sex and
its
relation
to
other than the creative instinct,
one must recognize that
it
has,
in
all
but the lowest
of
the
human species,
a
base
in
both the love and the affectional
nature, and
in
addition, the devotional (sometimes termed
the "religious”) nature.
Once this
is
understood,
it
is
easy
to
conceive the power
which desire,
a
mental faculty, combined with love,
a
heart
emotion, has over the unborn. These forces, wisely directed,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 61
control the destiny of the child before it is born and almost
forever thereafter.
In the organic kingdom outside of the human, and even
in the undeveloped human, the sexive or creative instinct
is blindly obeyed. Self-seeking there, as in all else, and not
propagation, is the all-powerful motive, if there actually is
motive, other than urge.
All living creatures, aside from man, whether bears or
horses, cats or dogs, fishes or flies, or any other living thing
possessed of gender, invariably are not concerned with self
reproduction, or propagation of the species, until such in
crease appears; by which time Nature has brought new in
stincts and passions into play. This being true, the paralleling
of man to animal, as is so frequently done by the materially
minded, is neither correct nor just.
In animals, sexive and parental instincts are distinctly
separate. In man—at least in the morally developed man—
they coexist. In animals the offspring and parents separate
at maturity. In the human, an affectional relationship is
maintained not only throughout life, but even into the be
yond of life.
Frequently we are told that animals obey the impulse once
a year, or in season, and that man should do likewise. These
materialists forget, if they ever knew, that in the deeper
sense, sexive expression is also the highest affectional or love
expression. In true love it is secondary to the passional re
lease. Man expresses his love for woman by the true marital
embrace as he does his love and devotion to God by prayer.
The lower type of man is governed more by the instinct
or biological urge; the beast. Some men, at least up to a given
62 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
point, risk
all
for the satisfaction
of
the urge. They display
little or no affection, and care not
in
the least for the con
sequences; leaving that
to
nature and the abused woman.
Woman and nature then,
do
the best they can with the
material
at
their command. The average man—and this ex
plains why humanity almost
as
a
whole
is
what
it
is;
as
well
as
"man's inhumanity
to
man,”—has
an
insatiable "urge”
to
satisfy himself,
or
more correctly speaking, the "irritation,”
for such
it
is,
and this
is
all he cares for
at
the time. While
consequences are more
or
less foreseen, some sort
of
provisions
are generally made; for men, even
of
the lower type, marry
and mate, while beasts only mate.
The unfortunate part for the welfare
of
mankind,
as
a
whole,
is
in
the fact that rarely
do
the participants, even those
who believe themselves truly
in
love, consciously and will
ingly create
a
new being.
In
the animal world, one hour
seals the origin
of
the progenal result; and the men mark
the time, knowing
to
a
day when
to
expect the new animal.
It
is
lamentable, unquestionably
a
shame upon mankind,
that almost
all
of
the members
of
the human species have
been brought into being accidentally, rather than
as
the result
of
a
planned effort. Births, for the most part, are most un
happy events, hence the misfortunes, maladies and the in
humanities
of
the races. Stirpiculture,
or
the propagation
of
superior children, will never succeed
as
a
result
of
selection
alone. This must
be
left
to
the practice
of
the agricultural
stock farm and barnyard principles.
An Example from Mother Nature
In
Nature,
a
rich soil
is
required
if
a
superior grade
of
fruit
is
sought, whether this “fruit”
be
human
or
any other
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 63
sort. In the human sort, she demands the richest of “ferti
lizer” and
its
name
is
affection and love. Given affection and
love, plus nature
as
her helpmate, woman will make your
eyes glisten with the beauty and perfection
of
the work she
is
capable
of
doing.
If
you deprive woman
of
these two ingredients
of
a
deeper,
higher life, the result will
be
gnarled "crab apples,” and the
human crab
is
the gnarliest and most bitter fruit
in
all
of
God's gardens.
In
Nature two forces are
at
work.
In
the animal kingdom
she does her best
to
produce
a
superior grade
of
body only.
In
the human, Nature works almost wholly
to
produce
a
loftier order
of
beings; beings possessed
of
intellect, imag
ination and emotion.
Given the help
of
an
ordinary intelligence, and the as
sistance
of
a
kind, loving, feeling woman with
a
vision
or
an
ideal, she will produce
a
Christos
of
spirituality
or
the genius
of
an
Edison, not
to
mention the names
of
other great men;
names with which
all
of
us
are familiar, and who are foolishly
believed
to
have been just "accidents.”
Mating
of
the sexes, and
by
this we mean marriages,
is
to
be
understood
as
the nuptive union
of
the sexes; but actually
is
nuptive only when love
is
the prompter.
If
there
is
no
love,
it
becomes
a
desecration and
is
destructive
to
the partici
pants. Aside from this, the act
of
mating
is
productive
of
a
series
of
effects and results beyond the perpetuatory
or
pro
pagative one, wherein men and animals are alike—but there
the similarity ends.
In
the animal, sex distinctions are bodily
only.
64 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
IF THERE IS TO BE RACE PERFECTION, MATING, IN THE
HUMAN, SHOULD INVOLVE, AND ULTIMATELY MUST IN
VOLVE, AND EMBRACE, the vast domain of mind, body and
Soul, ALL INTERWOVEN BY AFFECTION AND LOVE. In the
non-human, the sexive office ceases when the reproductive
germ has become lodged in the female. With human beings,
ITS OFFICES HAVE ONLY BEGUN, FOR THE RESULTS WILL
CONTINUE THROUGHOUT TIME. WHAT THE ULTIMATE
RESULTS WILL BE DEPENDS ON THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF
THE WOMAN AND THE EFFORTS MADE BY HER, THE PRO
DUCER. She may, of course, be infinitely helped in her task
by a mate who is sufficiently enlightened and possessed of
that measure of affection which will induce him to assume
his full share of the labor involved.
Contrasting Two Kinds of World Leaders
Glimpse the two opposite results of the identical act, but
in different tempo; look at the Jugurthas, Attilas, Neros,
Hitlers and Stalins and that type of liquidators with which
the world has been, AND CONTINUES TO BE ACCURSED, by
permission, aye, abject submission, of millions who should
know better.
These leaders were called into being in an instant of time
to lash the earth in agony, the spawn of brute passion, of
beastly desire, without even a thought of love or affection.
Then turn the pages and behold a Christos,
St.
John,
Buddha, Confucius and others, nurtured
by
mothers who
had proof
of
love and affection
in
the manner
in
which they
were approached and protected, cherished and guided during
their period
of
pregnancy.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 65
In these instances, as nowhere else, is displayed the power
of prayer (desire), of affection, of Love and the willingness
to bring into the world true “laborers in the Lord's vineyard,”
on the one hand; and on the other, brute force, ugly passion,
lack of affection and aversion to even the thought of the
marital embrace.
The creative function, overshadowed by affection and love,
is,
by
all
odds, the highest force
in
man.
It
is
the God, the
Jehovah
of
creation.
In
the creative function, two principles
are interwoven, reciprocally acting and reacting upon each
other.
This
is
in
evidence everywhere and
in
all things
in
the
universe of which man
is
conscious. On the one side
it
is
governed
by
a
brute, beastly passion;
on
the other and truly
human-Divine plane,
it
is
governed
by
affection and love.
To this creative ability and energy all things are sub
servient;
to
it,
all things bend the knee
in
acknowledgment
of
its
supremacy. Without
it,
the ALL THAT
IS
would become
a
blank and starless void; terrible
as
eternal night; cheerless
as
the grave
of
those who died without hope. The deciding
factor and the ultimate result produced
by
this creative
energy depends upon whether the nuptial bed
is
over
shadowed
by
the angel
of
love and hope,
or
the mere satis
faction
of
passion.
God
is
a
dual being; and man, patterned after his Creator,
however greatly
he
may deviate from the pattern,
is
likewise
dual. The Deity
is
dual
in
a
double sense; being positive male
and receptive female. Man
is
aware,
or
if
not,
he
should be,
that his better side
is
the “she”
or
mother side. From this phase
66 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
of his being spring
all
the major elements
of
both his
goodness and his greatness, and right here
is
the reason for
the present philosophical dissertation.
If
this gentleness, graciousness and loftiness
of
spirit
is
not impressed upon him
by
his mother-to-be while she
is
enceinte, he will never have
it.
All men admire the intellectual
man; few love him, but all humans do love,
or
are drawn to,
the man possessed
of
much affection; because humans
instinctively feel that from his love, NOT HIS INTELLECT,
arise
all
the goodness, inspiration, and the generosity
of
the
Soul which characterize him. Of such
a
nature was Joseph,
father of the Nazarene.
We are all proud
of
a
Plato, but we worship
at
the shrine
of
the Christ.
It
is
the softer, the affectionate (not the
weaker) side
of
the Soul
of
man, that generates moral great
ness and grandeur
of
whatever form, and mighty (construc
tive) deeds become possible
to
man.
In
the love nature, alone, resides the power which has the
potency
to
transmute the savage man into
an
incarnate demi
god; or,
as
the Bible would have
it,
“ye have become the
sons of God.”
The Grand Secret
The greatest excellence
in
man's offspring can never
be
attained
by
parents who are merely physically perfect. The
woman who may
be
in
every way inferior except
in
her love,
IN LOVING AND BEING LOVED, IN DESIRING AND RECEIVING,
is
able
to
give
to
the world children who are truly great,
grandly “good”
in
the real sense
of
the word.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 67
The STRONGEST FORCE, GREATEST MENTAL POWER, and
CREATIVE ABILITY IN THE DOMAINS OF ART, SCIENCE,
PHILOSOPHY, LITERATURE, STATESMANSHIP AND LEADER
SHIP are invariably manifested by those who have been con
ceived in, nurtured in, and born in the affection of their
mother, and in whom the feminine side slightly over
balances the masculine, positive constructive side.
The man everywhere most welcomed, respected and
caressed—if that be a proper term to be used in conjunction
with true manhood—is the man who is the most magnetic,
hence truly affectionate. He is IN NO SENSE EFFEMINATE,
let it be understood, but radiates the qualities of true man
hood—MANHOOD MODIFIED BY HIS MOTHER'S SPIRITUAL
NATURE.
It is a maxim that whenever you find a truly great Soul in
a male body, he is more than half his mother. It is the woman
side of him that gives him power, mental vigor and enables
him to write his name in the annals of time; and by an under
standing of the eternal creative Law, all women who truly
Will, may mother such sons.
Love and the Creation of the Super Man
This treatise deals with facts as positive as does the farmer
in raising his crops or cattle. He must know his soil, his seed,
the time of planting, cultivating and harvesting. He must
know his cattle, the proper mating, feeding and raising. But
in all this there is one all-important factor the farmer and
cattleman does not deal with, and to which he need give no
thought—even in raising the finest crops or cattle: LovE
68 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
AND AFFECTION, AND THE EMOTIONS, FOR GOOD OR ILL,
BORN FROM THEM.
It is in the presence or absence of Love and affection,
wherein is found the key to the production of supermen or
super-devils—the murderous egomaniacs of the ages. Fortu
nately for the races of men, if the mother-to-be has the
knowledge and the desire, i.e., the willingness, she also has
the power to substitute her own love for that lacking in her
mate, and bring forth into the world a saint or master-man.
It is our mission to guide her in this holy work for the
benefit not only of her own peace of mind and happiness,
but also that of her child, and mankind in general. Regret
tably, in
all
too many instances, the entire responsibility falls
upon the mother-to-be; but the ultimate reward
is
well worth
the effort necessary and more than offsets the price she must
pay.
Love and affection, terms usually accepted
as
different
names for the same thing, imply much more than mere
attraction between the sexes and, unfortunately, one
is
as
little understood as the other.
In
the marital act woman faces heaven when she gives
herself
to
love and man, whether this
be
willingly
or
unwill
ingly
on
her part. Partly this
is
because
of
the way nature
created her, but, more importantly,
it
is
her celestial mission
on earth. She receives both the human and the divine
in
her
transfer
of
affection; even though
it
is
no
more than
a
duty
imposed upon her
by
man-made law.
Man,
on
the contrary, looks toward the earth's face, for
he
is
almost entirely
of
the earth, earthy; whereas woman
in
love
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 69
never
is.
The woman may
be
indifferent, even horrified
at
the part she
is
forced
to
play, but with
it
all, she looks into
the heaven above, and from that source receives
a
measure
of
Divine Love; for, low
as
she may be,
if
the right chord
within her
be
touched, she
is
able
to
mother heroes and give
Marys
to
a waiting world.
Excessive pre-conceptive marital pleasure may
be
pro
ductive
of
dyspepsia, not only
of
the body, but
of
mind and
Soul
as
well. When, peradventure, offspring follow
in
the wake
of
such abuse, they usually lack
in
all the grand
essentials
of
genuine and complete manhood
or
womanhood.
In
all such instances, more
or
less prolonged continence
is
desirable
to
permit full recuperation
in
order that full
vitality and virility
be
re-established before pregnancy
takes place. This
is
one
of
the essentials
if
a
perfect child
is
to result.
The Mystery
of
Human Reproduction
No sooner
is
the human spermatozoon, seed or germ,
lodged within the sacred and utterly mysterious, transcend
ently holy and divine—because reproductive-creative-Godly
established—chamber
of
the womb, and
its
filamental doors
closed, shutting
in
its
treasure—perhaps another savior—
from all eyes, than the woman's mystic-spiritual self within
her Soul, draws
its
attention from the womb and begins
its
all-important work upon the womb's contents.
If
she, the woman,
be
truly
a
woman who
is
to
become
a
good mother, then from that instant on, until her task
be
finished, she loves man no less, BUT HER UNBORN CHILD
MORE. Why? Because up until then, her love, her Soul's
70 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
welfare, depended on man. Now that a new Soul is in the
process of making—a Soul whose destiny and future welfare
rests wholly upon her LovE, her desire, her wise and con
tinued efforts—she rises to the occasion through an exten
sion and expansion of her emotional nature.
What the Mother Must Give to the New Being
The mother-to-be must give, unconsciously, but by willing
desire, the very best particles of her blood, brain, food, drink,
air, light, muscle, bone, lymph, cartilage, carbon, and a
million chemicals to build a new body, wherein a Soul is to
dwell for a time and until it is cast forth into eternity. The
unconscious spiritual self must give forth
all
of
the earth's
salt
to
make the body healthy and strong.
She must build canals, reservoirs, pumps, cylinders, flutes,
columns, domes, cellars, crucibles, retorts, ovens, and
a
mul
titude of chemical and mechanical laboratories of the most
marvelous kinds; build telescopes,
a
telegraph and telephone
system; following which, unconsciously except
by
means of
conscious desire and love, she must
go
aloft and bring down
the fires from heaven, spiritual flames without which the
Soul cannot exist; lodge angels all over the little mansion;
music here, science there, mathematics and memory; ambi
tion, hope, joy, sorrow, love, affection, graciousness, generos
ity, and, above all, ambition
to
become and attain.
What
is
the new Soul
to
become or attain?
Whatever
is
held
in
the mind
of
the mother-to-be; her
idealism; her constant wish; her unending prayer.
Her work, still perhaps unconscious, except for desire and
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 71
expectation, now takes another, a lower flight; she must call
up the tempters from the depths of being to offset and
balance the angels. Now come avarice, greed, anger, false
hood, and a fearful host besides; because if the new Soul is to
reach heaven, it must make
its
flight alone; must toil and
sweat, and tread upon the red-hot sands
of
sorrow and
suffering; wade through
a
million hells on
its
own feet;
fight
its
own way with
its
own efforts, while God looks on
and smiles; well knowing that the goal
is
sweet, even though
the road
be
rough and rugged, assured that victory
is
certain,
because of the material the MOTHER BUILDS INTO THE NEW
BEING.
Why, one may ask, are not the good things alone sufficient?
Why add the evil ingredients?
Because God and Nature have decreed man
a
dual being,
and
he
must win the fight and attain the heights
by
using
the good within himself against the evils, and thus become
strong and powerful
by
the manner
in
which he wages his
fight.
All this being true, should we not readily understand
that
a
true woman, while enceinte, has little,
if
any time
for frivolities, being engaged
in
so
grand
a
work?
The Change
in
the Locale
of
Woman's Love
Is
there any wonder
if
the pregnant woman's love
changes almost completely from her uterus
to
her bosom;
to
the breasts that must nourish her child?
Nevertheless, the vast millions, because they have given
little,
if
any, thought
to
the subject, NEVER HAVING BEEN
72 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
CHALLENGED TO THINK ABOUT IT, cannot understand this
change.
They feel and insist that during this period woman should
be
all
that she was before. They are unable
to
comprehend
that
a
whole universe exists between the two states; that,
in
fact,
a
NEW WORLD
IS
IN
THE MAKING. This woman,
formerly
so
sweet and
so
gentle, now dispossessed
of
an
understanding
of
herself and her moods, may
be
queer,
short, snappish, soft
at
one moment—cranky the next. Why?
First
of
all, because she has never been taught
to
under
stand herself
or
the great change that takes place during
pregnancy, and
so
has
no
means
of
control,
no
way
of
knowing how
to
transmute the undesirable into the desirable,
as
in
the process
of
sublimation.
Secondly, human nature within her
is
in
the making;
unfinished; hence, unstable. Nature
is,
as
we know all too
well, changeable
in
her moods, sunny, tempestuous, coarse,
mean, genial, calm, and then blustery.
Engaged
in
the formation
of
a
NEW BEING WHICH
IS
TO
BE BOTH GOD AND DEVIL, UNTIL ONE OR THE OTHER
FINALLY WINS, she
is
forced
to
incarnate all
of
these moods,
passions and emotions into the body, mind and Soul
of
the
new pilgrim about
to
begin his
or
her journey through the
valleys
of
the world
to
the throne
of
the Ineffable God.
This new creature should
be
well fortified
by
the mother's
Love, affection and Idealism; but
it
will
be
better still,
if
also clothed with the shield
of
a
father's manhood, strength
and honor.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 73
Woman's Labor Made Easier
If the mother-to-be is aided in her mysterious work—it is
mysterious, despite
all
that we think we know
of
procreation
—by a husband and father who
is
truly
a
man; one with
strength and with foresight; with patience incarnate; with
gentleness, not weakness, and who,
in
loving, kindly fore
bearance lends his assistance, her work
of
reproduction will
be
made that much easier and have far greater assurance
of
SulCCCSS.
74 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Preliminary Essentials
We have been philosophizing; trying to teach vital, arcane
and natural Laws governing reproduction, in pleasant doses,
but there are vitally important pre-conceptive requirements
that should not be neglected if a normal, healthy child is
desired.
FIRST: The husband should have his physician make a
thorough examination, or direct him to someone capable of
doing this, to make certain he is not suffering from any
infectious or inheritable form of disease, or from any con
dition, mental or physical, which would indicate that he
should not father a child.
SECOND: The wife should follow suit. It is highly impor
tant that she does not suffer from any inheritable disease;
that there be no anemic conditions of the blood; neither high
nor low blood pressure; heart, lungs and kidneys in good
condition and, equally important, no form of Neurosis.
THIRD: A period of waiting and thorough preparation so
that the vitality of both be at the zenith.
FOURTH: Thorough discussion, with full understanding
and agreement that the child is really desired; that there is a
willingness on the part of both to meet sympathetically the
moods resulting from a state of pregnancy and that each will
help the other in every way possible to overcome such moods;
not by weak sympathy, but by seeking the cause and remov
ing
it.
BOTH SHOULD FULLY COMPREHEND THAT THEY ARE
ENGAGING IN
A
WORK SECOND ONLY IN IMPORTANCE TO
76 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
THAT OF THEIR CREATOR WHEN HE FIRST CALLED MAN
INTO BEING AND SAW THAT HIS WORK WAS GOOD AND
WELL DONE.
Gestatory or Prenatal Period
Let us suppose now that the preparatory period has
progressed to within a month of the time arranged for preg
nancy to take place. If the mother-to-be has a full conscious
ness of what she desires the future of her child to be and the
father equally realizes the grandeur of the act that is to take
place, they will also realize that just as the farmer carefully
selects the seed he is about to sow, so must the seed of the
new life also have proper and most careful consideration.
This is accomplished by abstaining from the marital embrace
for a short period before impregnation takes place.
If the expectant father is naturally strong, affectionate and
of pure mind, then the spermatozoon being generated will be
filled with a vivifying force, vitally strong, incorporating the
manhood and character of the father. “Like produces like,”
and whatever is the nature of the father will be impressed or
be the nature of the seed germs.
The mother-to-be, in desire, purity and with expectation,
consecrates herself to that which is to be; and will do nothing
that might have an adverse influence, or impression—
mentally, physically or spiritually—upon the ovum to be
deposited in the uterus and impregnated.
Both father and mother-to-be, during the pre-conception
period, should arrange to obtain plenty of sleep, good, plain
food, fresh air, exercise, pleasant recreation and desirable
companionship.
This will provide the foundation for both mental and
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 77
physical health of the child to be conceived. The marital
embrace, hence impregnation of the ovum, should take place
as soon as possible after the menses cease and purification
has taken place. The egg or ovum, is then held in the womb
ready for
its
fecundation. The longer the egg remains there
before impregnation occurs, the less
its
vitality, hence the
desirability for impregnation while the ovum
is
at
its
highest
state
of
fertility; when the woman's desire
is
strongest, and
she
is
able
to
return the deepest degree
of
affection.
The great majority
ofwomen wait for from six
to
ten days
or
longer before they permit the marital embrace and allow
the semen,
a
natural magnetic force,
to
enter. The greatest
number
of
children are conceived
at
this time; generally
undesired and unprepared for, and when the ovum has lost
much
of
its
elasticity and firmness, with fear
of
pregnancy
still present. The result,
in
all too many instances,
is
a
puny
child; weak, with
an
inborn liability
to
all manner
of
illness
on the least provocation.
Men and Women Differ
in
Their Love Nature
Women, married
in
love,
or
what they believe
to
be love,
uninformed
of
the Laws governing love and
its
natural
termination, permit what we now recognize
as
false modesty
and shame that has no basis
in
fact,
to
interfere with their
full,
or
even partial realization,
of
the vital importance
of
normal, natural passion.
They have never been taught, hence
do
not fully realize,
that
it
is
PHYSICAL LOVE WHICH BRINGS ABOUT CONCEP
TION; the means
to
the creation
of
the child. This passion,
BASED
IN
LOVE AND AFFECTION, should
be
strong, vital,
alive with intensity. The father,
if
in
reality
a
man,
is
nor
78 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
mally and naturally strongly impassioned, though unfortun
ately, he may permit his passion to overshadow his love or
affection.
The woman who permits conception to take place while
sexually passive, fulfills but a small portion of her maternal
duty; irrespective of how well and carefully she takes care
of the child after
its
birth. Her first, greatest and most
important duty, consists in being sexually and affectionally
fully awakened when the seed
of
a
new being
is
received
by
the laboratory that
is
to
fashion itand bring
it
forth into life.
Only
in
this manner can strong, healthy, vitally robust
children
be
brought into life; children
fit
to
meet the battle
cry
of
the strong, and even the vicious.
All too many
of
those we know
as
“good” women deny
passion's natural sway; hence are suppressed and depressed.
They are, because
of
false teachings,
or
some other cause,
ashamed
of
the Divinely-inherited, God-given power and
potency which
at
first belonged
to
Him alone, and then was
graciously transferred
by
Him
to
His creation.
It
is
undoubtedly true that more
of
the safely married
“good” women are
in
dire need
of
the cultivation
of
normal
passion, than there are
of
those
in
need
of
subduing
it.
Potentially, all except those wholly wrongly conceived and
ignorantly born, possess passion.
It
is
latent
in
nearly all,
waiting only
to
be
aroused and fanned into
a
flame;
a
flame
which,
if
rightly directed, will save and glorify the individual.
Conversely,
if
abused,
it
will react negatively and ultimately
destroy the individual. Like all things both high and low,
its nature
is
dual.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 79
The instinct for love and affection, the feeling of passion,
is not omitted in any normal creature. Unless based on pure
selfishness, the desire of women for marriage, for tenderness,
compliments of the opposite sex, are all phases of love
passion, in their various ramifications.
Words are worse than wasted in trying to prove the
universal existence of passion. Passion is necessary to normal
life and constructive existence. Even in religion, it is the
basis of the feeling which we know as devotion. The passion
less creature has neither love, affection nor devotion.
A Woman's Desire Should Be the Governing Law
The final decision in the matter of marital relationship
should unquestionably belong to the woman. She is the
arbiter of destiny. The male human, in common with all
animals, should be subject to her desire, even when she is
arbitrary, unjust or unfair. Where is the moral, self-respect
ing, manly man who would force his attentions on any
woman? The desires of the female govern even in the jungle;
even in insect life this is true. In the design of life as now
obtaining, only the human male ever forces himself upon
an unwilling or unprepared female.
True, general lack of passion in so many of our “good”
wives is deplorable, and the disappointed, unhappy husbands,
plus the haggard, flabby appearance of so many wives while
still in the middle years of life—when both should be in
their glory—fully attests to this unhappy state. To this
situation, largely growing out of ignorance and misconcep
tion, are due
all
too many
of
the premature deaths
of
puny
children and the almost unbelievable number of women who
80 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
suffer from what is generally termed "female trouble” on the
one side, and the hell of prostatitis and attendant ills of men,
on the other.
When a woman does not respond to the marital embrace
with an aroused passion, the results are, necessarily, injurious
to her generative organism. Passion prepares the way by the
extension and enlargment of the sexual organism and prop
erly lubricates it in preparation for the creative act. Passivity
in a woman renders her taut, unprepared, unlubricated,
inert, hence the act almost automatically disrupts the equa
nimity of her delicate organism—created expressly and most
exquisitely for this purpose, and which has the ability when
correctly aroused of adjusting itself, with
all
its
minute blood
vessels,
to
respond freely and joyously toevery amatory desire
and movement. We must never forget that
in
woman,
at
least, thought and desire are the great arousing forces. Man
unless
he
has feelings
of
positive dislike, responds almost
automatically.
The weakly-sexed and the self-righteous woman who
disapproves, BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT LOVE, actually brings
about
an
inertia and
a
shrivelling
of
that portion
of
her being
which would,
if
permitted
to
respond, prove her salvation
in
more ways than one. Awakened desire-call
it
passion,
if
you will—enlivens these delicate organs and permits them
to
receive life's magnetic forces from the contact; adding
health and longevity
to
her who wisely follows Nature's
laws. Those who foolishly
or
unwisely refuse, pay the penalty
all
too frequently
in
some form
of
prolapsis, lacerations and
other so-called “female” ailments caused
by
suppression
or
abuse.

Co-operation Brings Peace and Harmony
The woman who is married, and no longer free to act as
she otherwise might, should learn to co-operate with her
wedded husband unless he is in fact an unfeeling brute.
Through such cooperation, she will bring happiness to the
home and family and avoid much suffering. If there are
children, as there usually are, it will help to give them a
desirable, even if not an altogether correct, heritage.
The deeper the passion and affection felt during the em
brace when conception takes place, the greater the intensity
of life conferred upon the offspring. Parents—especially the
mother, if her desires are pure and deep—confer upon, or
transmit
to,
their children their physical constitution, intellect
and morals. On the part
of
the woman, this
is
largely limited
to
the strength
of
her desires; and,
in
the case
of
man,
to
the degree
of
sex-power
at
the time
of
conception. The entire
parentage, with
all
its
temporary states,
is
transmitted
at
this
time
to
the offspring. Dormancy
of
these functions,
at
the
time
of
the creative period, will have
a
strong tendency
to
weaken the children.
The love union, i.e., the marital embrace, when deep affec
tion
or
love
is
present, activates all
of
the organs
of
the body;
especially the mind, the nervous system and the heart, and
arouses every elevating emotion. The child conceived
as
the
result
of
such
a
union will
be
endowed with great vital energy
and emotional possibilities, and therein
is
laid the ground
work for success,
if
not actual genius.
The desirability,
in
woman,
of
passion under control
is
readily conceivable.
If
we contrast this state
of
mind, heart
and nerves with the passiveness, listlessness and even aversion
82 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
of the average woman during the marital embrace, we will
readily foresee the difference in results to follow.
Greater love and affection are essential if a higher human
ity
is
desired. Love should
be
thought, felt and acted. Love
is
the creative, activating force
of
the universe. Lack
of
love,
and lack
of
keen desire,
is
the cause
of
moral, mental and
physical weakness. Where there
is
lack
of
love, the entire
being
is
out
of
tune with the universe and with humanity
in
general. The new creature should
be
the offspring
of
a
love
that
is
passionate; the deeper the love, the more human the
child.
The combination
of
love and passion
in
both
of
the par
ents results
in
the blending
of
both of the parents
in
the
child.
In
instances where the child,
as
so often happens,
resembles only one
of
its
parents
in
features, habits, tempera
ment and inclination,
it
is
a
clear indication
of one
of
two
things; either the parents were not united
in
Soul,
or
one
of
the parents was physically and passionately weaker.
Conception should
be
a
deliberate, prearranged affair. Even
the time for birth should
be
given consideration. All things
being equal, August and September are good months for
conception
to
take place because the birth will then
be
in
the Spring when new life begins
to
express itself
in
all
the
world.
Why are the hours
of
darkness thought
to
be
the proper
time for the creative act? There
is
a
reason for
it,
though
not
a
sound one. Throughout the ages the creative act has
been considered
as
something shameful; something
to
be
hidden from all the world. The statement that has been
repeated billions
of
times and continues
to
be
repeated: "Man
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 83
is born in sin [as the result of a sinful act], of a few days,
and of much suffering,” gives us the key for this idea. THERE
NEVER WAS A MORE UNTRUTHFUL IDEA THAN THIS.
If creation is a sin, then God has been guilty of the greater
sin, because He was the first creator, or cause of the creation
of man and nowhere is it written that He created man in
shame or during the hours of darkness. On the contrary,
after He had made man He looked upon His handiwork and
saw that “it was good.” Why then the taboo on man's
creation? There is no shame in creation, nor in the act of
creation unless it be the result of passion alone, without the
help of God's handmaidens: Love and affection, and the
sooner man's mind becomes enlightened on this vitally im
portant subject the better for all of humanity.
Physiologically, the best time for conception to take place
would be during the light of day and more especially during
the early hours of the day while the sun is rising in the East
and man's vitality is at
its
peak. Man
is
so
steeped
in
ignor
ance and superstition;
so
obsessed
by
race belief that the
conjugal embrace
is
sinful, that, with rare exceptions,
he
has
no
desire for the embrace
at
this time
of
day. On the con
trary, this Divinely creative act
is
reserved for the hours of
darkness,
as
if
to
hide the face
of
the actors.
It
is
as
though
they were committing
a
crime against man and God when,
in
fact, they are,
or
should be, co-creators with Him.
LIGHT
IS
LIFE, LIGHT, LIKE LOVE,
IS
GOD. Light, sun
shine, love, these imply health, strength, happiness, mental
clarity
so
much needed
in
the world. Light with
its
attendant
heat,
is
the source
of
life. Darkness
is
weakness, fear,
inertia;,
all
synonyms
for
decay and death. Physical man
never has the amount
of
vital power during any other time
84 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
of the day that he has in the morning after a night of rest,
recuperation and rebuilding. No one is in possession of his
greatest strength when the hours of darkness fall. Concep
tion should not occur when only the shreds of physical
strength remain. The universal rule should be: Choose that
period when vitality is strongest, when desire is greatest.
The impressions upon the future child are at no other
time more marked than at the time of actual conception; the
most holy period in life when the trinity: God, man and
woman in love, unite that they may create. It cannot be too
often repeated that sex—the creative force—is the strongest
of all forces in man. With this force are impressed the desires
of the parents upon the child at the moment when the human
seed, containing as it does, the image of the future being,
is projected into God's divinely-designed laboratory, where
it is to be fashioned into a human being.
One of the Great Secrets of Life
Passion cannot be separated from Love, nor the two in the
creation of a perfect child—and why? Because true pas
sion is one mode, and important one, of Love's expression.
Its offices are triplicate. Once people understand this one
great secret it will be the beginning of the end for many
of the ills from which the world as a whole suffers. Brains
and intellects differ almost as much as do physical forms.
Hearts and affection are ever the same.
Through the latter, alone, man can attain Godhood,
while woman will reign as queen and be his equal, where
she now, for the most part, is a drudge or a toy, depending
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 85
upon the position she holds. Woman, as such, whatever
her position, because of her nature, has most of love crys
tallized in her being and for that one reason, if there were
no other, is Divinely entitled to be the peer of any man
as long as she directs her love and
its
power wisely.
This
is
not
by
reason
of
either her beauty, accomplish
ments, wealth or position, but because she has the womb,
God's laboratory, wherein she may,
IF
SHE BE WISE AND
WILLING, fashion and complete that which
it
took God,
Nature and puny man, singly and combined,
to
barely begin,
and that
so
badly,
it
is
ever
a
wonder that the world
is
not
more
of
a
madhouse than
it
is
today.
IF
SHE BUT WILLS IT,
woman can
be
so
great
an
artist that, from the worst seed,
she
is
able
to
raise, she has raised, many
a
splendid mental
giant; redeem the race from savagery; greatly improve the
arts, science, even religion and make the earth truly inhabi
table;
a
beautiful, heavenly place
in
which to live.
All this being true,
it
follows that when
a
woman
is
preg
nant, her whole desire should
be
that
of
giving
to
the world
a
perfect specimen
of
her art, and
if
she does this truly,
sincerely, we shall soon
no
longer behold such sadly mis
shapen human beings
as
now walk this fair earth
of
ours.
The woman carrying
a
child
in
her bosom, judiciously
loved and properly treated; not spoiled and pampered,
or
kept
on
a
dead level
of
life, can, during every ten days
of
her
pregnancy, add more Soul—the God side
of
man—strength,
beauty, compactness, energy, power, capability and possibility,
and force
of
character and genius
to
the baby she
is
carrying,
than she possibly could
in
all the weeks
of
her gestation
if
neglected
in
these several respects.
86 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
She will be able to build more greatness in every hour
she lives under desirable conditions, and each step or stage
of gestation will be carried one or more degrees further
toward perfection. The only difference between a genius
and a human weakling
is,
the first
is
finished step
by
step
as
the work proceeds. He
is
well-kneaded,
as
must
be
good
bread; and he
is
needed too; well risen; well baked; therefore,
well flavored; well done; will keep well; will
be
wanted
by
all, and wept over when gone.
The weakling
is
well described
by
the often-heard expres
sion: “Oh well,
he
is
only half-baked.” This
is
a
fair de
scription
of
all too many
of
those who pass
as
men.
These misfits would
be
the result
of
accidents only,
if
men,
and women, too, fully understood the one great immutable
Law: LOVE LIETH AT THE FOUNDATION. Love
is
CON
VERTIBLE, passion, enthusiasm, affection, holy desire, fire,
Soul, God. That the nuptive moment, that instant wherein
the germ (spermatozoon)
of
a
new being
is
lodged; when
a
part
of
man's essential self
is
implanted within the matrix
of
the woman with intent and purpose,
is
the most solemn,
serious, powerful moment that can
be
known
to
man on
this earth.
A
Great Truth Expressed
by
Dr.
B.
P.
Randolph
Dr. Randolph never wrote
a
greater truth, and
no
other
writer ever stated
a
truth one-half
as
great
or
more important
than this:
“Whenever you see
a
rich, jovial spirit
or
power
in
a
boy
or
girl, wherever you behold force
or
genius, you may rest
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 87
assured that the conception of which they are the result,
occurred when their parents both loved and were impas
sioned. Au contrare: whenever you come across genuine
meanness, lean, weazelish, deceitful, slanderous, lying,
scrawny, white-livered people, grab-allish, selfish, and
accursed generally, you may safely wager your very life
that such beings were conceived of force, and were moth
ered by passionless, sickly, used-up wives, without the
slightest danger of periling your stake!”
Whatever the dominant thought, desire and/or feeling at
the time of conception, it is instantaneously impressed upon
the impregnating cell and impregnated ovum. If the parties
partaking in the conjugal act are sane, sensible, cheerful,
affectionate and graciously inclined—a term the meaning of
which is but little and imperfectly understood—the child will
at the outset of its life be endowed with like desirable
qualities. If the husband at the same time be governed by
reason and the qualities of true manhood, the child will
become a power in the world and affairs of men.
On the contrary, if the parents be weak, fearful, fretful
and uncertain of intent and purpose, the child is equally
certain to be frail, unstable, and more or less incompetent;
hence a liability, and not a blessing, to society generally.
Important Facts to Remember
During the nine months of her pregnancy, the mother-to
be is truly engaged in God's vineyard; doing God's work.
If the product of her labor is to be as nearly perfect as pos
sible, reverence and encouragement should be her portion.
88 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Nothing that is impure should pollute the sacredness of body,
mind or Soul.
Sexual intemperance is to be avoided. Of the many evils
to be most shunned, inordinate indulgence in the conjugal
act is worst. THE DESIRES OF THE WOMAN MUST GOVERN;
SHE SHOULD GOVERN HER DESIRE. If sacredness were al
lowed to govern, many deformities and weakness of body and
Soul would be avoided.
Purity in EVERY RESPECT is essential during the process
and period of maternity, if best results are to be obtained.
All too many parents transmit to their children tendencies
which will later sully the family honor; yet these children
are not guilty in the slightest; they are merely manifesting
that which is inborn in them.
Any form of vulgarity, whether in reading, conversation,
thought or desire, is to be religiously avoided lest it be im
pressed upon the cells of the brain in formation and manifest
as a habit during life. Any such tendencies should be elim
inated by substitution. This is possible by recalling to mind
something pleasant and beautiful immediately when a vulgar
thought comes to mind. This is a form of sublimation and
is the means of overcoming all evil tendencies of this nature.
What Causes Criminal Tendencies?
All too many children are born with strong criminal
tendencies because their mothers-to-be constantly read tales
of rape, arson, vice and murder in newspapers or novels and
the feelings aroused were impressed upon the forming cells
in the child's mind. Mother-to-be, wherever you are, what
ever you are engaged in doing, draw a circle of purity, virtue,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 89
goodness and kindness about you. Do not permit any im
pression of evil to enter your mind or heart. If it does,
immediately "root it out” by recalling an experience or vision
of beauty. Think no evil, speak no evil, permit no one to
discuss evil with you. Hold in mind constantly the thought
of mental and spiritual well-being as well as physical health
for the baby in the making.
Every form of true, kind, ennobling emotion you feel and
experience will be reflected upon your unborn child. Every
intellectual effort on your part will be an influence toward
its
thoughtfulness and the development
of
talent and intel
lectuality. On the contrary, and even with greater force,
every thought and feeling
of
anger, all fretfulness on your
part, will impress upon the unborn child's mind the spirit
of
maliciousness and
be
a
handicap all the days
of
its
life.
Maternal irritability
is
all too frequently the inducing
cause
of
ill-tempered children. The destructive, quarrelsome
boy, insulting
to
his mother, tormenting
to
animals, the bully
of
his companions,
is
the more
to
be
pitied the meaner his
disposition, just
as
he
should
be
had
be
inherited the
predisposition
to
tuberculosis
or
insanity. HE
IS
A
VICTIM OF
THAT WHICH WAS IMPLANTED INTO HIM, knowingly
or
unknowingly,
by
the passions
of
his mother while pregnant.
It
is
she who
is
most guilty, even though unconsciously
or
unintentionally so.
Let Temperance and Reason Govern
TEMPERANCE AND REASON MUST GOVERN. COMMON
SENSE MUST BE THE CAPTAIN AT THE HELM OF THE
SHIP PLYING THE SEA OF MOTHERHOOD.
If
unbridled desire
90 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
is permitted to run rampant, a girl of the street or a libertine
may be the result, of which there are far too many now.
If,
on
the other hand, normal desire
is
denied
or
suppressed,
the child, especially
if
a
girl, may
be
love-hungry,
a
vampire,
and the world is full
of
the unsatisfied and unappeasable.
Be reasonable, rational, and the results will be desirable.
No sane, sensible, reasonable husband will force marital
attentions
on
any woman, and especially not upon his preg
nant wife. To do
so
may give rise
to
an
aversion sufficiently
strong
to
impress itself upon the child—whether girl
or
boy—with disastrous results. Self-restraint
at
this time will
pay dividends beyond expectations.
On the other hand, the woman with child who
is
hungry
for the embrace should make this known to her husband
by
one
of
the innumerable methods familiar
to
woman; and he,
if
at
all possible, should respond with vim and affection,
remembering that all that
is
done during this time will make
its
impression upon the child
as
certainly
as
happened with
the cattle
of
Jacob
in
Biblical times:
“And Jacob took him rods
of
green poplar, and
of
the
hazel and chestnut tree; and peeled white streaks
in
them,
and made the white appear which was
in
the rods.
“And
he
set the rods which
he
had peeled before the flocks
came
to
drink, that they should conceive when they came
to drink.
“And the flocks conceived before the rods, and BROUGHT
FORTH CATTLE RING-STREAKED, SPECKLED, AND
SPOTTED. Genesis 30: 37, 38, 39.
EVERY TREE BEARS FRUIT ACCORDING TO ITS KIND. This
is
true
in
the human tree, but with this exception: THE
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 91
PREGNANT WOMAN, WITH OR WITHOUT THE HELP OF HER
HUSBAND—though the cooperation of the husband is highly
desirable—MAY BRING FORTH A CHILD POSSESSED WITH
NONE OF THE TWAIN'S WEAKNESSES, AND WITH QUALITIES
NEITHER OF THEM POSSESS, BY IMPRESSION; that
is,
by
her thoughts, desires and efforts, and herein
is
the mystery
of
Prenatal Culture, and
its
almost unbelievable possibilities
of
bringing into the world
a
more desirable human family.
Beware
of
Sweets
All too many women during pregnancy, DUE TO DEFI
CIENCY
IN
THEIR OWN SYSTEM, become possessed with
a
desire
to
consume inordinately undesirable foods, especially
sweets
of
all kinds. Normal desires should be satisfied, but
at
the first indication of an unnatural desire restraint must
be
exercised and the desire itself
be
eliminated
by
the prac
tice of wise substitution.
Sweets
in
one form
or
another have their place
in
a
normal
diet, but when
at
all possible, natural, undenatured sweets
should
be
consumed and these may
be
most generously found
in
honey, dates, figs, raisins and other such fruits. Desserts
should not
be
part
of
the diet.
If
there
is
a
desire for the var
ious foods generally known
as
"desserts,” then, when not
very hungry,
a
meal should
be
made
of
the desired dessert
such
as
real ice cream
or
pure gelatins, and milk, with no
other food at such
a
meal.
Diet During Pregnancy
The diet for the woman while pregnant
is
of
the utmost
importance.
It
is
not for
a
moment
to
be
forgotten that all
92 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
of the material to be used in the building of the body of the
child-to-be, MUST BE OBTAINED EITHER FROM THE FOOD
AND DRINK PARTAKEN BY THE MOTHER WHILE BUILDING
THAT BODY, or FROM HER OWN BODY.
Since we know that under modern conditions, subsisting
on foods which have been greatly denatured or grossly adult
erated, the mother-to-be is herself already under-nourished,
that
is,
has not been consuming foods
of
a
nature supplying
her with the required material for body, bone, nerve and
brain building", How
Is
IT
PossIBLE FOR HER TO SUPPLY
THE REQUISITES FOR THE BUILDING OF
A
HEALTHY BODY
FOR HER CHILD IF SHE DOES NOT POSSESS THEM HERSELF,
AND IF THIS
IS
NOT DONE, HOW CAN THE CHILD BE NOR
MAL AND BE RESPONSIBLE TO NORMAL ACTION?
The selection of foods should be
a
wise one. All denatured
and devitalized foods should
be
refused. The pregnant
woman requires additional energy because her labors have
been doubled. There should
be
an
abundance
of
good protein
selected from milk, cheese, eggs, every kind
of
sea food”,
beans, soy-beans, peas and lentils—all proteins, and, for those
whose diet included
or
includes meat, the various meats,
WITH THE ExCEPTION OF PORK (especially) and veal.
There must
be
a
plentiful supply
of
vegetables, both raw
and cooked, because these contain the essential minerals and
"Contradiction
of
this statement
is
impossible. Witness the consump
tion
of
millions
of
dollars worth
of
vitamins and minerals; self-prescribed
or
by
physicians.
If
natural, undenatured, non-devitalized and unadulterated
foods were the rule, these so-called food accessories would
be
unnecessary.
"Sea food
in
general contains organic Iodine
so
essential
to
proper
mind functioning. Without this element there could
be
no sanity. The
Iodine
in
the Thyroid glands not only possesses
a
powerful influence on all
mental activity, but also upon the functioning
of
the other important glands.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 93
they also neutralize the acids and toxins in the proteins.
There must be starches, especially those obtained from po
tatoes with their skins, peas, beans, lentils, barley, rice
and the various whole grains,
all
rich
in
vital starch and the
minerals; some
of
the grains also containing rich lecithin,
the nerve and brain builder.
A
certain, but not too great
amount
of
fats must be included
as
a
lubricant, and the fruits
for their vitamins and minerals and their ability
to
help
neutralize bodily and food acids and toxins.
Danger of Lack
of
Calcium
Very few women, pregnant
or
not, have
as
much Calcium
(lime)
in
their systems
as
is required for health, and
certainly not enough
to
furnish
a
sufficient amount for the
bony structure
of
the child being developed. For this reason,
foods consumed should
be
natural and possess plenty
of
Calcium. With rare exception, sweets, whatever their nature
or
name,
do
NOT possess this essential building material;
hence
no
great amount
of
sweets should
be
consumed; only
enough
as
required for heat and energy.
Alcohol
a
Great Danger
Many women during pregnancy develop
a
desire
for
alcoholic drinks. Alcohol, during pregnancy, especially,
should
be
recognized
as
an
actual poison both
to
the pregnant
woman and her child. Alcohol
in
any form
is
fattening
to
the woman with child.
It
is
a
fiery, liquid fuel that will set
her already sensitive nerves
on
fire.
It
is
irritating
to
the
mentality.
It
stimulates the appetite.
It
arouses the emotions
that are already unbalanced:
It
is
a
corroding poison
to
the
brain cells forming
in
the child; those cells that must guide
94 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
the child on the path of life. If these brain cells become
poisoned or are made abnormal in any manner before birth,
it is almost certain that they will continue so throughout life.
The woman who is given to partaking of alcoholics,
irrespective of how temperately, and who seeks to become a
mother, should discontinue their use entirely during the
months before she conceives, so that no effects will remain
when she does conceive.
Avoid Condiments
Condiments, with the exception of a very small amount of
white or red pepper, just enough to season food, come under
the same classification of stimulants as does alcohol, but
with much less potency for evil.
The Evils of Tobacco
The use of tobacco in
its
effects upon the pregnant woman
and her unborn child
is
second only
to
alcohol. An unknown
author penned these lines:
-
“Tobacco
is
an Indian weed:
It
was the Devil who sowed the seed.”
He no doubt had
in
mind the poisonous, hence evil
influence, tobacco has
on
the delicate nervous system
of
women, and especially
so
on women
in
pregnancy.
Tobacco contains,
as
all physicians and those who have
investigated know,
an
active poison;
so
active that
at
its
first
use the partaker may, and frequently does, become "deadly
ill.”
It
is
only
by
continued use that the natural resistance
of
the body
is
overcome and Nicotine becomes the master.
Tobacco has
a
direct influence
on
the generative system,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 95
especially the ovarian and uterine system of the woman; on
the nervous system and the brain. Like alcohol, it may first
activate the brain and then be followed by weakness or
inertia.
Irrespective of what we may wish to believe, tobacco has
an
ill
effect, both
on
man's nervous and his mental system.
Man's system, however,
is
not nearly
so
finely sensitive
or
delicate
as
that of woman and more readily adjusts itself.
Moreover, the nervous system
of
man does not readily affect
his emotions, because
he
is
governed
by
his reason rather
than his emotions.
Woman
is
governed
by
her emotions and these emotions
are
in
turn greatly influenced
by
the state
of
her nerves.
During pregnancy these nerves are "on edge”
as
it
were, and
are readily affected. Whatever affects woman's nerves, and,
especially, her emotions, directly affects the child being
fashioned
in
her inner laboratory.
As with alcohol, the woman desiring, and preparing,
to
become
a
mother, should give up smoking
as
she should
alcohol, months before pregnancy
is
to
occur, especially
if
she has
in
mind giving
to
the world
an
exceptional child.
In
all
of
these matters
it
is
well
to
constantly bear
in
mind
a
powerful Law:
Self-preservation—that
is,
preserving one's-self from all
that
is
harmful and undesirable and not conveying anything
of
a
like nature
to
others—and self-respect—refraining from
those things which may degrade
or
harm ourselves
or
others—will go
a
long way toward freeing the world from
evil.
Is
this not the innate desire
of
the woman seeking
to
give
to
the world
a
perfect child?
96 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Physical Weakness in Children
A constantly-increasing number of children are born with
out the vital energy necessary to the proper functioning of
body and mind. They are “born tired.” The causes for this
are numerous. The pregnant woman performing tasks almost
beyond her strength is undoubtedy a cause, but far from the
Indin CalulSe.
Our foreparents traveled to the new world in search of a
home, labored beyond what we would now recognize as
endurance, and in addition, suffered innumerable hardships
and dangers; nevertheless, the mothers of those days BECAME
THE MOTHERS OF THE MEN, REALLY STRONG MEN, WHO
DEVELOPED THE COUNTRY AND MADE IT GREAT. The main
cause of widespread weaknesses in our present generation is
that the race as a whole, and women in particular, suffer
from lowered vitality, due to denatured foods and a conglom
eration of what are called "foods”—preparations made to
look attractive and taste well, but denatured, devitalized and
adulterated to such a degree that, in many instances, they
work as a poison in the system, rather than a food.
These concoctions, easily procured and prepared for con
sumption, are the main cause of the lowered vitality from
which man suffers. In addition to this is the lack of proper
rest, recreation and exercise; the constant on-the-go-ness;
the late hours plus sweets, tobacco and alcohol. All of these
things help to denature and devitalize the body of both men
and women, and as a consequence, the children suffer even
before birth.
ALL THINGS PRODUCE AFTER THEIR KIND. It is equally
and most certainly true that ALL THINGS PRODUCE AFTER
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 97
THEIR CONDITION! Because this is a certainty, it follows that
the more vital and healthy, both physically and mentally,
the procreating mother, the more so will be the child. Herein
is the secret of a perfect generation; this cannot be too
frequently repeated or too strongly emphasized.
Idleness as an Evil
Idleness during pregnancy is one of the worst evils and is
to be avoided at all cost. There should be constant activity,
but it should be of such a nature as not to deplete the system.
Activities having no special aim and not of a constructive
nature, should be avoided. All duties, whether congenial or
not, should be performed in patience and with a sense of
being necessary; they are important, and being important,
they are constructive; hence confer an honor and not an
indignity. There should be recognition of the fact that all
necessary labor is honorable and that honor is man's—and
woman's—highest estate. This inbreeds honor in the unborn
child, and, certainly a new sense of honor is badly needed in
the race as a whole.
The Father's Place During Gestation
Great emphasis has been placed on the part played by the
mother in the drama of bringing forth into the world a new
being. This would make it appear that maternity is exalted
at the expense of paternity. This is not meant to be so. The
father is certainly a great deal more than an incident in
procreation. If he will take a part, or be permitted a part,
in the preparatory and gestatory period, he will most certainly
be greatly interested in the growth, education and govern
98 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
ment of the child from the time of
its
birth until
its
develop
ment into manhood or womanhood.
Isolation
Is
To Be Avoided—Need for
Companionship
No woman,
no
woman
in
pregnancy, no mother, can live
an
ideal life
in
isolation. At best she
is
but one part
of
the
whole; one-half
of
a
sphere; one part
of
a
little world. Neg
lect
is
as
destructive
as
is
abuse. Some men, perhaps all too
many men, are ashamed
of
the appearance
of
their wives
during pregnancy.
A
degree
of
modesty
is
commendable.
There comes
a
time when the home, rather than the social
function,
is
the proper place for the pregnant woman. All
things within reason;
so
should
be
woman's life toward the
end
of
her pregnancy.
In
days past the pregnant women were honored
at
home
and
in
public. Maternity was
a
god
to
whom the Romans
paid tribute, and woman was paid exalted deference. With
out doubt, this homage paid her gave her
a
feeling of
superiority which was impressed upon,
or
imparted
to,
her
unborn child.
Rome, during her age
of
greatness, before her manhood
and strength were dissipated
by
idleness and
in
riotous living,
was the envy
of
all
nations; chiefly because
of
this homage,
nobility and sense
of
honor.
In
nations where the mother
is
relegated into the background,
or
feels
a
sense
of
shame
or
inferiority because
of
her pregnancy, she
is
unhappy and
dejected when she should feel proud.
If
she feels embarrassed
because her form
is,
for the time being, misshapen, her forth
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 99
coming child cannot escape the impression or impact of this
feeling which becomes a most serious handicap to his future
welfare and success.
A Truly Fearful Condition
It is now generally estimated that almost one-third of all
children born into the world are more or less mentally un
balanced. This mental abnormality ranges
all
the way between
feeblemindedness
to
actual idiocy. Do YOU WANT YOUR
CHILD TO BE AMENTAL WEAKLING INCAPABLE OF MEET
ING OTHER MEN IN COMPETITION IN THE ACTIVITIES OF
LIFE?
IT
IS
FOR YOU TO CHOOSE.
In
forty years
of
active
service
in
this field
in
all parts
of
the world, NOT
A
SINGLE
MENTALLY INFERIOR CHILD WAS BORN IF THE INSTRUC
TIONS HEREIN GIVEN WERE FOLLOWED. However,
it
should
be
emphasized that men and women whose families
have
a
strain
of
insanity should not become parents.
100 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
The Great Factors Involved
in the Creation of a Normal Child
Calcium — Iodine –Thyroid,
Phosphorous –Iron, Vitamin D and C
Estimates based on careful investigation clearly indicate
that not five percent of either children or adults have a
sufficient amount of calcium in their systems for proper
functioning of the human machine. The importance of this
mineral element is only beginning to be understood. The
deficiency, in general, is due to the lack of consumption of
foods rich in this element.
Without sufficient calcium there cannot be perfect nu
trition. This may cause what is commonly termed mal
nutrition, and affects the mother before conception takes
place. There is consequently imperfect nutrition during
gestation; the child in the human laboratory is not properly
nourished; perhaps actually undernourished to a degree
developing an abnormality. Also, unless this deficiency is
remedied, the mother will not be able to properly nourish
the child after its birth.
When the amount of calcium in the food ingested is
insufficient, the blood must take the calcium it needs from
the bones. If the pregnant woman does not consume foods
rich in this mineral; rich enough to supply HER OWN
REQUIREMENTS WITH ENOUGH LEFT OVER FOR THE PUR
POSE OF BUILDING THE BODY STRUCTURE OF HER CHILD,
102 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
THEN THE DEFICIENCY MUST BE MADE UP FROM HER
OWN BONY STRUCTURE.
THIS DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE DEVELOPING CHILD. MORE
THAN THIS, THE MALNUTRITION INTERFERES WITH EVERY
OTHER PART OF THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT AND HAS A
POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON THE BRAIN STRUCTURE. The
two most important sources of calcium are milk—natural,
untreated, unheated milk—certified when at all obtainable,
and bone meal in one form or another.
Bone meal tablets are also rich in the important brain and
nerve element Phosphorous. They can now be readily ob
tained and every woman contemplating motherhood should
AT ONCE BEGIN TO TAKE SUCH CALCIUM AND CONTINUE
THROUGHOUT HER PREGNANCY AND LACTATION-THE
BREAST FEEDING OF HER CHILD.
Another source of calcium is egg shells. This is second
only to bone calcium. Egg shells may be crushed, placed in
a jar, covered with fresh lemon juice, stirred frequently for a
few days, and this calcium-vitamin elixir is ready for use:
half a teaspoonful three or four times a day. Bone calcium
may also be prepared at home by boiling soft bones until
they are edible.”
Milk, of course, is an ideal calcium food and should form
a great part of the diet before, during and following preg
nancy. It contains a perfect combination of fats, nerve and
brain food, and the organic mineral elements required for
normal growth and development. Second to this as a food is
*These instructions are given because there are millions of women, not
only women, but others also, living in out-of-the-way country places where
it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain either bone meal or egg shell
calcium in tablet or capsule form.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 103
cottage cheese. Both milk and cottage cheese are highly con
centrated foods and must be combined with plenty of vege
tables, both raw and boiled.
Iodine
It is certain that there cannot be proper brain (mind)
functioning without Iodine. Iodine is essential for mental
balance. It is as important to the mentality of man as is
calcium to the bony structure and nutrition of man. Experi
ence covering many years has demonstrated that in many
instances of the Change of Life (Menopause), mental dis
turbances during Change of Life, and some forms of Neurosis,
organic Iodine in conjunction with calcium offers almost
immediate relief and gradually wholly eliminates the defici
ency, restores mental balance and removes disturbances
coincident during Menopause. In severe disturbances, the
biological Thyroid with calcium may be necessary.
This essential substance in a highly developed condition
and readily assimilative form, may readily be obtained from
the sea vegetables such as sea-kelp, dulse, sea-lettuce, Irish
Moss. Sea-kelp is not alone rich in Iodine, but in almost every
other mineral element required for perfect body building. It is
readily procurable in tablet form and should be taken regu
larly in conjunction with calcium.
Irish Moss is a good food before and during pregnancy,
and during lactation (breast feeding). It is not only a perfect
mineral-carrying food, but it can be made into truly delightful
dishes.
These plants grow in the ocean, the cradle of life. The
ocean is rich in practically
all
minerals and supplies the sea
weeds with
a
large amount
of
organic Iodine. Our foods today
104 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
are not entirely devoid of the essential brain building Iodine,
but certainly do not contain nearly enough of this absolutely
essential element; the Iodine having been soaked or leeched
out of the soil in many parts of the country and carried to the
ocean by the rivers. For this reason vegetables and other land
grown foods are wholly unable to supply the necessary Iodine,
with the result that both humans and animals suffer propor
tionately from lack of Iodine. Animals do not suffer this lack
as much as humans, because, with them, there is no need of
it in mental activity or balance.
The organic Iodine derived from these marine plants not
only supplies this element for certain parts of the body, but
also assists the body in the proper utilization of other
minerals and food factors.
DULSE (Rhodymenia Palmata) generally known as Sea
Lettuce. It is a beautiful purple color and liked by many for
its
odd taste. Most people prefer
to
take
it
powdered
in
capsule
or
in
tablet form.
KELP (Mycrosistus Pyrifera) This plant differs from other
sea weeds because
it
grows partly above the water exposed
to
the sunshine. May
be
powdered and sprinkled
on
salads
or
other foods
or
taken
in
capsule
or
tablet form. Eight
to
sixteen grains
of
the powder
is
the usual amount
to
be
taken
at
a
time.
IRISH Moss (Chondrus Crispus)
is
also known
as
Carra
geen. This not only supplies
a
vital Iodine, but also furnishes
an
equally vital protein
in
the form
of
gelatin; one readily
digested. Delicious dishes, such
as
Blanc Mange, Irish Moss
Jell and other puddings may
be
prepared.
So
important
is
this article
of
food
to
the woman who truly desires
to
give
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 105
birth to a perfect child that we here give instructions for
its
preparation
in
various desirable forms.
BLANC MANGE
(Vegetable Gelatin)
Before pregnancy, during Gestation and Lactation
3
cups milk
2
tablespoons honey
1
cup water
2
egg yolks
1/4 cup granulated Irish Moss
1
teaspoon vanilla
Pinch of salt
Add the water
to
the moss and boil ten minutes, then add
the milk and reheat until lukewarm, strain through cloth
or
fine strainer. Add the honey, egg yolks, salt and favorite
flavoring. Set aside and chill. Serve with milk
or
cream.
IRISH MOSS GELATIN
(Without Milk)
1
quart water 1/4 cup Irish Moss, granulated
1/4 cup honey
1
mellow apple
Pinch of salt
1
banana
3
tablespoonsful lemon juice
Boil moss ten minutes, strain through cloth. Add honey.
When cool, add other ingredients, set aside and chill. Other
fruits can be used.
To make salads more interesting and tasty, plain gelatin
just flavored with lemon (without fruit
or
vegetables)
is
used. Cut into small cubes and add
to
salad.
Some do, others
do
not, like the sea flavor. To change
it,
tart fruits
or
tart fruit juices like plum juice, fresh
or
pre
served peaches, cranberries, cranberry juice
or
raw, chopped
cranberries help
to
make the Blanc Mange simply delicious.
106 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Any preserved or stewed fruit, berries with juice, extra milk
or cream may be poured over moss gelatin. Fresh fruit or
berries can be served with
it.
Berry, fruit
or
vegetable powder
can
be
sprinkled
on
top
of
it.
The moss gelatin
is
particularly suited
as
dessert for dinner
if
made either with crushed pineapple
or
grated carrots, celery
or
other vegetable
or
mint powder—not
so
well
if
made with
fruit and milk.
MEDIUM FOR PUDDING
1/4 cup granulated Irish Moss
1
quart water
Put moss into kettle, add water and boil for one-half hour;
strain. This makes
a
gelatin that
is
used for puddings instead
of corn starch.
MOSS BEVERAGE—I
(A Pleasant Drink)
1/4 cup granulated Irish Moss
3
pints water
Wash and drain moss. Bring
to
boil and strain. Flavor
with honey, vanilla
or
other flavoring.
MOSS BEVERAGE—II
(Soothing Drink)
1
pint water
1
tablespoon honey
1/4 cup granulated Irish Moss Juice
of
1
lemon
Wash moss and drain thoroughly. Put into kettle and
cover with water. Simmer for 30 minutes
or
until slightly
gelatinous. Strain, add honey and lemon juice. Said
to
be
soothing
to
the throat.
IRISH MOSS POWDER
Sprinkle
a
little
of
the finely powdered moss over,
or
in,
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 107
any food. A shaker comes in handy here. An easy method,
no cooking or preparing necessary. This is one way to in
crease the Irish Moss consumption with children and those
who object to taking anything in dosage form.
We cannot too frequently or too emphatically repeat:
Our years of experience has convinced us that in the present
age and under present conditions, a physically perfect,
and mentally normal child is impossible without an abundant
supply of organic Calcium and Iodine.
Thyroid
In all instances where there is a history of any form of
feeble-mindedness, mental irritationality, "queerness,” partial
or actual insanity, on the side of either the father or mother
of the child conceived, Thyroid should be prescribed during
the entire pregnancy in addition to the calcium and Iodine.
WARNING: This is to be taken only by direction, and under
the observation of a competent physician. The thyroid gland,
a highly important one in the proper functioning of the hu
man machine, requires a certain amount of Iodine which once
more emphasizes the importance of that element.
To Women Who Want Children, But
Have Failed to Conceive
It is roughly estimated that there are millions of women
who are most anxious to conceive and become the mothers
of families, either large or small; who have made every effort
to conceive but who have failed.
There are many reasons and causes which prevent concep
tion; one of the most general is that known to the laity as an
"acid field.” Where this is the cause, three to six months may
108 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
be required to change this “field,” but it can be done and it
is neither difficult nor unpleasant.
This method of procedure very seldom fails where neither
organic disease nor pathological conditions are deterring
factors.
A little patience, a little effort, a little stick-to-it-ness, and
millions of childless women may become happy mothers".
The Nursing Period
Physicians who formerly endorsed the artificial feeding of
children are now rapidly becoming convinced that it is far
from the proper method and that, for many reasons, breast
feeding is far more desirable, both from a purely physical and
a psychological standpoint.
If the mother-to-be is to be capable of perfect lactation—
with a plentiful supply of milk carrying
all
the elements
of
nutrition, she MUST PREPARE FOR THIS DURING HERENTIRE
PERIOD OF PREGNANCY. This
is
done
in
part
by
eating
a
plentiful supply
of
good and properly selected and combined
food; but,
in
addition
to
this, there
is
another necessity, one
not
at
all difficult
to
obtain.
The agent used
is
both
a
natural and
a
legendary one. We
would not make
so
bold
as
to
claim
it
to
be
a
recognized
scientific formula. However, many physicians who have used
it
during years
of
practice claim for
it
two things: EASY
CHILD BIRTH and generally
a
plentiful supply
of
milk.

man—but the red man in America. It was a remedy well
known and universally used by the red man; in fact, it was
his only remedy for these two very important purposes and
it has universally proven itself in our hands.
Mitchella, or Squaw-Vine
Normal, Easy Childbirth—Lactation
It is most generally known, especially to the common
people—to whom the Obstetricians and Baby Specialists are
unknown—as Partridge-berry; Squaw-vine (an Indian term);
Squawberry (also an Indian name), Checkerberry, Deerberry.
and One-berry. It is found in the woods of most states in
America.
Its
present day use
is
based upon the traditions and
practice
of
the American Indians and later upon the practice
by
Botanic, Physio-Medical, Eclectric and Natura physicians.
Its
influence
is
specifically upon the reproductive organs
of
the female. This influence
is
desirable during the entire
period
of
pregnancy and nursing. Under
its
influence,
it
is
possible
to
eliminate many
of
the frequently experienced
erratic pains and unsatisfactory desires from which pregnant
women
so
frequently suffer.
The nervous system becomes tranquil
in
place
of
emotional.
Reflex symptoms are removed. The urinary function becomes
normal. The bowels become more regular. Labor
is
ap
proached without the appearance
of
the usual irritating,
aggravating symptoms; dilation becomes completed more
rapidly; the expulsive contractions strong and effectual;
involution
is
rapid, and
in
most instances, there are no sub
sequent complications
to
contend with; childbirth
is
compara
tively easy and nursing the child becomes
a
normal and
simple matter.
110 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
AMitchella or Squaw-vine should be taken regularly begin
ning with the third month of pregnancy and continued until
nursing is finished. It is most satisfactory in
its
results
if
taken
three times a day.
A
tincture
of
Mitchella,
5
to
30 drops;
a
syrup
of
Mitchella,
15
to
30
drops;
or
an
infusion may
be
made of it.
Threatened Miscarriage
Many women labor under
a
constant fear
of
miscarriage
during the entire period
of
pregnancy, more especially those
living
in
districts where the service
of
a
physician are not
easily obtainable.
If
Mitchella
is
taken throughout the entire
period
of
pregnancy, then, barring accidents, placental dis
eases, syphilis
or
acute infection
of
the mother, there
is
little
need
of
fear
as
far
as
miscarriage
is
concerned, especially
if
the mother-to-be
is
fortified with vitamin
E
and K.
Breast Feeding Alone
is
Normal and Natural
Before the birth
of
a
child,
its
character, temperament and
physique are conveyed
to,
or
formed by, the pregnant woman's
blood, and her desires and mode
of
life. After birth, the milk
of
her breasts and her general behavior continue
to
do
the
same thing.
It
is
our contention that, psychologically,
if
both
mother and child are
to
be
normal, breast feeding
is
essential.
The mother should continue
to
think, desire and live dur
ing the nursing period, exactly
as
she did during pregnancy.
Every globule
of
her milk
is
saturated with the character,
the feelings and the mentality
of
the mother who ingests the
food and alchemically turns
it
into milk—the life for her
child.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 111
ONE THING NEITHER A PREGNANT NOR THE NURS
ING MOTHER SHOULD FORGET FOR A MOMENT is the fact
that it is now scientifically proven that every passion such
as fear, worry, anger, hate and jealousy actually manufac
tures a specific poison, and this poison becomes part of
the blood and affects the unborn child as it does the child
being nursed by
its
mother.
On the other hand, every desire, every lofty emotion,
likewise creates what might
be
rightly termed
an
elixir
of
life which has
a
constructive, elevating effect.
Let
us
cite this example: Here are two pieces
of
paper
identical
in
every respect. One
of
them
is
worth
a
few
pennies, the other
a
thousand dollars. What makes the differ
ence? JUST
A
SIMPLE IMPRESSION. One
of
these pieces
of
practically worthless paper
is
a
blank, on the other the Gov
ernment has stamped, printed
or
impressed the words and
symbols making
it
a
thousand-dollar negotiable note. To ac
complish this there had
to
be
a
desire and
an
activity.
The child
in
embryo
is
such
a
blank paper; the desires,
the efforts and the activities
of
the pregnant mother do the
stamping, the impressing, the printing. Naturally the ma
terial—the seed germs received from the father have
as
much
to
do
with this
as
has the properly prepared paper,
in
making
a
good bank note.
The mother who
is
capable
of
breast-feeding her child and
refuses
to
do
so
commits
a
crime against herself, her child and
the Race.
During the entire period
of
nursing,
as
during pregnancy,
the marital rite should
be
engaged
in
only when desirable
and agreeable
to
the mother, and this should
be
in
moderation.
112 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
Who is there who does not admire the mother animal
patiently nursing
its
young? The nursing mother
is
in
tended
by
both nature and God
to
be
contented, filled with
health and vigor
to
convey
to
her child, the bright eyes
and pink cheeks expressing fullness
of
life;
in
short,
an
expression
of
general happiness and beauty.
Unfortunately, all too many mothers are unhappy, drawn
of
face, dull
of
eyes, figure emaciated and generally listless.
This
is
usually attributed
to
nursing. This
is
utterly
in
error, the cause lies far deeper and the same condition,
possibly worse, would
be
present
if
she did not nurse her
child. MATERNITY
IS
THE CENTRAL FACT IN LIFE. Child
bearing,
as
is
child-nursing,
is
an
entirely natural phe
nomenon. Nature ever rejoices
in
her period
of
reproduc
tion.
WOMAN
IS
PART OF NATURE.
In
the hands
of
woman—not
in
the acts
of
legislative
bodies—is found the means for the salvation of the race.
It
is
she who molds humanity for good
or
ill. She
is
God's
handmaiden
in
the work of creation. The sooner this fact
is
fully recognized the better for humanity.
The subject
of
procreation and regeneration
is
at
once both
simple and difficult. Plain terms may seem
to
confuse, but
should never
be
the cause
of
shame. The things that God
in
his wisdom and the depth
of
His Love has created should not
bring
a
blush
to
the cheek
of
any man
or
woman
to
read,
discuss
or
investigate. Only the prude can
be
shocked, and
he
only because
he
has
a
guilty conscience.
The knowledge
of
sex
in
all
its
normal, natural and
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 113
spiritual functions—and it has a spiritual function—being
so essential to the well-being of mankind, cannot by any
stretch of the imagination, be in any manner destructive or
degrading to moral purity. Maternity is the creative office
made use of by Divinity according to His own design and is
sacred as humanity may become Divine, Holy as God is Holy.
THE INTENT AND EFFORT GRACIOUSLY EXECUTED HOLD
THE KEY TO THIS ACHIEVEMENT.
114 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
A Most Interesting Case History
in Tabloid Form
In order to convey these vital instructions in simple words
and form, let us forget time and begin the narrative in the
year 1921 and thence retrace our steps.
The physician sat quietly in his office, studying his texts
as he usually did when not occupied with his professional
duties. The bell of his office rang and, being alone, he himself
opened the door to be met with a surprise in the form of a
rather petite young woman whom he recognized as a little
girl he knew years ago; the daughter of a friend of many
years past.
“Why, Mary Jane,” he greeted her, while at the same time
inviting her to the office, "What brings you here and at this
time of day?” -
"Doctor,” she answered, somewhat hesitatingly. “I just
had to see you. You were a close friend of my father and
we often talked about you. I am in need of the help I feel
you can give me, but it has taken me a long time to muster
enough courage to come to see you.”
“Mary Jane,” he said encouragingly, “you know well
enough that any help I can give you is yours, not only for
your sake, but also for the sake of your father, who was both
a close friend and fellow student with me.”
“That is just it,” she commented, “and it is one reason
for my hesitation. If you will not think hard of me, you will
permit me to recall that at the time you knew me, what you
116 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
then believed, was considered just a little "queer” by our
neighbors and friends. You were known to be engaged in
a study of books which among our German-American people
bordered on what they called a "strange belief,” but lately
I have read some of these books still in my father's library,
and it is because of this study I am here to see you.”
"No matter why you are here, or what the neighbors
thought, I am wholly at your service,” he assured her.
“Doctor,” she continued, “I am married to a man who is
far above the average, but more or less average in his ideas.
He is truly a good and kind husband; is successful in business,
and is satisfied with things as they are.
“You know, of course, that I was humbly born. My father
was a good man, but had many old-fashioned ideas, among
them that a girl's place in life is to be wooed, married, have
children, be a good wife and mother, and an excellent house
keeper and lastly, a good companion. Education had little
or no meaning to him insofar as girls were concerned. For
that reason I had only a common school education.
“My mother, as you also know, was a good woman. She
was most kind, gracious I should say, and ever ready to help
a friend or neighbor. She was much like your own good
mother. Her education, like my own, was sadly neglected.
Her sun rose and set in her husband and family. So much
for my background.
“I have been married three years, but there are no children
to bless our home. During these years I have been reading
and a strange thing has happened. Whether this is due to
my reading or whether it was inborn in me from my parents,
I do not know, but one thing is certain; I have an intense
desire to follow in the footsteps of some of the women so
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 117
much praised in these books; I DESPERATELY WANT TO GIVE
TO THE WORLD SUPERIOR CHILDREN. I do not care whether
these be male or female, if they will really glorify God. Can
I do this? Will you help me?” she pleaded.
As the physician in this story, we had been interested in
this subject for many years. We knew what was necessary,
because in previous instances of this nature, wonderful results
were secured in each and every instance where the mother-to
be was willing to co-operate by following a more or less
strict set of instructions.
We were therefore enthusiastic about the prospect of add
ing one more mother-to-be to the numerous others who had
been highly successful in bringing perfectly formed and
mentally superior children into the world.
After a moment's pause we said: "I will gladly help you
in every way I may, but before we go into the ways and means,
I must ask you a few very important questions.
"DO YOU DRINK ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES2”
ANSWER: "Only occasionally.”
Question: "Do you smoke?”
A. “Not very much.”
Q. “Are you given to the eating of much sweets, cakes,
candies?”
“Not regularly.”
“What about tea and coffee?”
“Not as a habit.
“Now then, the most important question of all. YoUR
ANSWER WILL DECIDE WHAT THE ULTIMATE RESULT WILL
BE.
|
118 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
"Are you willing, perfectly willing, aye, even anxious, to
begin at once to give up
all
alcoholic drinks and smoking,
and
to
continue tea, coffee and unnecessary sweets only
in
moderation,
in
order
to
prepare yourself
to
conceive, and
give birth,
to
the perfect child you desire?
“Are you willing, and
do
you think yourself capable
of
governing such passions
as
hatred, resentment, malice, dis
content and the rest
of
their kind,
so
that these will not find
a
medium
in
your child
to
manifest themselves?
A.
"I
honestly assure you that
I
am perfectly willing
to
do
all
of
these things and
I
know that my husband will
be
most
anxious
to
cooperate.”
"Then listen,” we continued. “Listen well and follow my
instructions
as
closely
as
possible. Consult me whenever you
feel
in
need
to
do
so.
I
will
be
your father confessor and your
guide
to
the best
of
my ability.
“To begin with,
it
is
well
to
remember that you need not
deny yourself anything that
is
not detrimental
to
your own
health and happiness. All that
is
actually necessary
is
for
you
to
live
a
natural life.
"You will begin
at
once
by
giving up entirely and
as
quickly
as
possible, both alcohol and tobacco. Tea and coffee
you will partake
of
sparingly;
a
cup for breakfast, and possibly
one during the day
if
you feel tired and
in
need
of
a
stimulant.
"Unnecessary sweets such
as
cakes and candy must
be
used
very sparingly. They replace necessary vital foods, and lack
ing the calcium required
to
build the bony structure
of
the
child, they do much harm.
"Your diet, beginning now, and following throughout
pregnancy,
is
to
be
simple. Good food and plenty
of
protein,
such
as
was the diet
of
your family. These are,
in
their order:
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 119
MILK and COTTAGE CHEESE; dishes made of the various sea
weeds for their essential Iodine and mineral contents to help
build a normal body and brain. All the sea foods such as
the various fishes and oysters for their iron; shrimp for their
Iodine, crabs, lobsters and clams for their vital food content;
peas, beans and lentils for their vital starch as well as their
protein and, lastly, if you eat meat, eliminate veal and pork.
These protein foods should form almost half of your diet.
“Next in order are the vegetables, both raw and cooked.
These are highly essential for two reasons: First of all, they
furnish the absolutely essential mineral elements; secondly,
they neutralize the acids and toxins of the proteins. There is
a third and also an important reason; they furnish the rough
age required for proper elimination.
"Starches are also highly important. The best of these are
whole rice and barley,
all
of
the whole grain products; all
rich
in
an
organic starch, the mineral elements and lecithin—
a
nerve and brain food element. Then there is the common
potato, best prepared
by
baking and eaten with its skin.
“Lastly, the fats. These are obtained
by
combining cream
and milk
in
your diet. They are also
a
part
of
all sea food and
of some of the other articles of diet.”
"What about desserts?” she suddenly interjected.
"Delicious,”
I
assured her, “but truthfully,
an
abomination
to
mankind
as
at
present consumed.
“In the first place, they usually follow the meal, and after
the appetite and need for food has been fully satisfied. Being
actually
a
surplus, they often are the cause
of
indigestion, and
frequently the cause
of
congestion
in
the system.
"Secondly,
in
these modern days desserts are mostly com
posed
of
denatured and devitalized foods (?), hence rob the
120 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
system of calcium and other necessary elements, instead of
furnishing these elements.
"No desserts then,” she accepted.
"Not necessarily so,” I replied. "There are many desserts
rich in food value. Among them are pure ice cream; all of
the dishes that may be made from the sea weeds; rice and egg
puddings, the pure gelatins and even berry pies, but note this
carefully. Whenever you have a desire for any of these
desserts, NEVER EAT THEM FOLLOWING THE MEAL WHEN
YoU ALREADY HAVE EATEN ENOUGH. Eat them before you
start eating other food and you will not over-eat. Or better
yet, select one of these desserts and a glass or two of complete,
certified milk, and let this be your meal.
“See to it that there is proper and complete elimination
so that there will be no congestion in the system.
"Get a sufficient amount of sleep.
"Get plenty of exercise, in the open air or sunshine.
“Do not neglect recreation. It is not material what this
may be. The opera; good music; good plays; no heavy dramas;
playing cards if you can prevent yourself from becoming
angry at your partner's misplay, or being emotionally upset;
dancing if you wish, but not after you become tired; see ball
games if you enjoy them. No constructive recreation is for
bidden you; but do not overdo anything.
“During
all
of
this time, both before and after you con
ceive, and during all
of
your pregnancy, ever keep several
things
in
mind:
“Do not permit yourself
to
become emotionally upset
or
downright angry.
If
there
is
cause for
it,
remember that
to
become overwhelmed
by
it
will not correct the cause
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 121
and it will do you harm. It will manufacture a poison
which, coursing through your system by means of the
blood, will likewise flow through the body of the child
being fashioned within your laboratory.
“Always and forever, hold your ideal before your mental
vision as an all-consuming fire. Remember that your DE
SIRE is the means of impression—the printing press that
will make a thousand dollar bank note out of a plain,
though correctly prepared, sheet of paper. YOU ARE THAT
PRINTER; YOUR CHILD IS THE SHEET OF PAPER: YOUR
DESIRE DOES THE IMPRESSING.
“Two or three months after conceiving, begin to take
Squaw-wine in some form. This will prepare you for a normal,
natural, easy childbirth as well as develop the mammary
glands and assure you an ample supply of milk to breast-feed
your child.
"During all of your pregnancy, see to it that you ingest a
plentiful supply of calcium in the foods you consume, or by
taking bone meal in one form or another. This you continue
while nursing your child and after that to replenish your own
supply.
“Should you become abnormally mentally fatigued or be
come conscious of your Thyroid glands, see me or consult your
local physician. You might be in need of Thyroid substance
as so many women now are.
“During the last months of your pregnancy, further prepare
yourself for a natural, normal delivery by taking short warm
sitz baths. When the first pangs of labor are felt, call your
physician and then take warm sitz baths of half-hour dura
tion.”
122 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
As a doctor I was keenly interested in this special case,
because of long friendship with her father and also due to the
fact that the father was more or less in harmony with these
beliefs, and I kept a careful record.
In due time a child was born. It was a boy. The delivery
was almost painless and of less than an hour's duration. The
child was of normal weight, perfectly formed. The mother
was easily able to nurse him until it was time to wean him.
He possessed a keen mind and graduated from high school
at fifteen, graduated from college, then prepared for his
chosen profession.
Today (1949), he is becoming internationally recognized,
even though still below 30 years of age.
Since the birth of this boy, two other boys and girls have
been born to this mother. All of them nursed at the mother's
bosom. All are strong, healthy, beautiful of form, keen of
mind and give every indication of becoming members of a
regenerated race. The mother is healthy and happy; youthful,
the pride of her husband, and seeks no other happiness than
her home.
This doctor's book of records is filled with instances such
as this; it is a large book, becoming larger by the day; and
there is no record of a misshapen body or a mentally weak
child.
Summary
1. A new age has come and the call for a new race. To
accomplish that requires the raising of better offspring
through directed efforts of improving desirable qualities
and eliminating undesirable qualities. In the animal
world this is called stirpiculture and consists of a sys
tematic attempt at improving a stock or species by selec
tion, suitable environment and attention to the laws of
breeding. It can be accomplished in the human family
by preconceptive and prenatal culture.
2. In man this requires following a healthy, natural and
normal life and the active employment of the pregnant
woman's power to mentally impress upon her forming
child the qualities she desires it to have.
3. A child's training must already begin before birth, if it
is to attain to
its
highest degree
of
mental, physical and
spiritual development. Proper preparation for concep
tion and care during gestation
is
far more important than
any possible after education.
4.
Parents are responsible for properly preparing them
selves for parenthood; living properly
as
regards rest,
food, exercise, and especially mental and emotional
stresses, and recognizing the fact that impressions during
pregnancy shape the doom
or
fortune
of
the offspring.
5.
The destiny
of
the individual, hence
of
the nation,
of
the
race itself, depends upon the mothers
of
the world and
the prenatal conditions arranged for their children.
Salvation from extinction lies
in
propagation undertaken
124 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
knowingly and understandingly. The parents working
harmoniously in conjunction can do more toward true
reforms than all the temperance, vice and corrective
societies of the world. A child desirably conceived,
wisely nourished in the bosom of the mother-to-be, and
guarded by the love between father and mother will
never go wrong and cannot be led astray.
. The secret of a mother's ability to transmit to her chil
dren any desired quality, goodness, greatness, talent,
potentiality, and possibility even though she does not
possess it herself is the greatest of all the phenomena in
the universe and is based in her desire and love for what
she is creating. “Any mother can produce offspring that
shall be superior to either parent, if she so will, and by
dwelling only on that which is true, beautiful and good.”
. Heredity foreordains that offspring shall be in the like
ness of one, both, or a mixture of the parents. This is
true throughout the animal world where there is no
modifying influence, or applicable law to retard or ad
vance the traits, shapes or tempers of the progenitors.
In the human race, both prenatalism and heredity
fix
the
natural bend
or
tendency
of
the child
to
be. The will,
feeling, desire and active effort
on
the part
of
the preg
nant woman may completely reverse heredity.
.
The period
of
transmittable influences has been divided
into three divisions:
1.
The Preparatory Period;
2.
The
Gestatory Period;
3.
The Nursing Period.
The preparatory cycle begins with
a
preconceptive per
iod when the prospective parents should train and
fit
themselves mentally, physically and spiritually for their
responsibility. This
to
be
followed
or
preceded
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 125
10.
11.
by a thorough medical examination of each to be
certain that both are free of infectious disease or any
other condition, physical or mental, prohibiting parent
hood. Every mode of life that is undesirable should
be eliminated, including alcoholic drinks, tobacco, de
vitalized foods and every form of profane thinking.
Everything that is weakening to the body or degrading
to the mind and the finer feelings must be abolished.
Only clean and elevating thoughts should be enter
tained. Every effort should be made to cultivate neat
ness, system and order, as well as cheerfulness, gentle
ness and graciousness. If these qualities are not part
of themselves, then they must be built into the ego
by Will and desire so as to become a part of the off
spring. If a mother-to-be wants her child to be a great
musician or artist, or excell in any profession, even
though she herself is not such, she can do so by constantly
thinking about it and fervently desiring it for the child.
This is the vital secret for the creation of superior
children.
The strongest force, greatest mental power, and crea
tive ability in the domain of art, science, philosophy,
literature and leadership is invariably manifested by
those who have been conceived, nurtured, and born in
the affection of their mother. It is in the presence or
absence of love and affection wherein is found the key
to the production of supermen or super-devils, murder
ous egomaniacs like Attila, Nero, Hitler, and Stalin, or
a Christos, St. John, Buddha or Confucius.
The preconceptive medical examination for detection of
infectious or inheritable disease, or any condition, men
126 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY

tally or physically, which would indicate that they
should not have a child, must ascertain that the wife
is not suffering from anemia; neither high nor low blood
pressure; that her heart, lungs and kidneys are in good
condition; the bony pelvis not too small, deformed or
obstructed and, equally important, no form of neurosis.
As soon as a woman realizes that she is pregnant she
should, if at all possible, at once report to her phy
sician and have him begin a series of monthly checks,
to make certain that no complications develop, or de
tect them in inception when they can still be taken care
of.
Each visit must include
a
urinalysis and blood pres
sure determination
to
discover the earliest onset of
a
possible impending uremia.
The mother-to-be should closely watch her diet. She
should beware
of
candy
or
white sugar and
its
seductive
by-products. She should use only natural undenatured
sweets
as
honey and generously found
in
dates, figs,
raisins and other such foods. Beware also of white
flour and
its
culinary enticements. Use only whole
grain products. The fare for the pregnant woman
is
of
the utmost importance. The female parent cannot give
her baby any building material she does not possess
herself. Subsisting
on
highly denatured
or
grossly adul
terated foods the modern potential mother
is
herself
already greatly under-nourished,
so
it
becomes impera
tive that from now on her selection of menus should
be
a
wise one. There must
be
an
abundance
of
proteins,
which are the building blocks
of
the body,
a
plentiful
supply
of
vegetables, both raw and properly cooked,
because these together with fruits contain the essential
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 127
14.
15.
16.
minerals and vitamins and also neutralize the acids and
toxins in the proteins. There must also be the proper
proportion of starches and fats to make a balanced meal.
Among the mineral requirements of the pregnant
woman calcium ranks highest. Most women do not
have enough to furnish a sufficient amount for the bony
structure of the child being developed. Next in im
portance come phosphorus, iodine and iron. Because
of the poor mineral contents of our depleted soil it may
be necessary to make up the mineral deficiency of our
common foods with so-called supplementary mineral
preparation feeding, such as bone meal tablets for
calcium and phosphorus. Another excellent source of
organic calcium is the shell of eggs. Seafoods, both
animal and vegetable, are rich in iodine which is essen
tial to the thyroid gland and mental balance.
Alcohol is a great danger and an actual poison both to
the pregnant woman and her child. The woman who is
given to partaking of alcoholics, and who seeks to be
come a mother, should discontinue their use entirely
during the months before she conceives, most assuredly
after. The use of tobacco in
its
poisonous effects upon
the pregnant woman and her unborn child
is
second
only
to
alcohol and should likewise
be
abolished.
Physicians who formerly endorsed artificial feeding
of
children are rapidly becoming convinced that breast
feeding
is
far more desirable both from
a
physical and
psychological standpoint and alone
is
natural. How
ever,
if
the mother-to-be
is
to
be
capable
of
perfect
lactation—with
a
plentiful supply
of
milk, containing
all
the necessary elements
of
nutrition, she must prepare
128 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
17.
18.
for this during her entire term of impregnation, already
beginning with the preconceptive period, by eating an
abundant supply of good and carefully selected and
combined foods.
As far as labor and lactation alone are concerned there
is fortunately another very effective agent, both a natural
and legendary one. This was the universally used remedy
of the aboriginal red race of America, and their only
remedy for easy childbirth and a plentiful supply of
milk. It is the herb Mitchella, or the Indian name,
Squaw-Vine or Squawberry. It is found in the woods of
most states of America and
its
present use
is
based
upon the tradition and practice ofthe American Indians
and later the Botannic and Natura physicians.
It
is
not
a
generally recognized modern scientific formula but
the mothers
of
such great men
as
the patriotic Pontiac
and the noble and dignified Tecumseh did very well
with it.
An important thing the pregnant
or
nursing mother
should never forget
is
that
as
the mother's character and
desires are conveyed
to
the unborn child through the
maternal blood
so
it
is
also transmitted through the
milk
of
her breast. She should continue
to
think, de
sire, and live during the nursing period exactly
as
she
did during pregnancy.
It
is
now scientifically proven
that every passion, such
as
fear, worry, anger, hate and
jealousy actually manufactures
a
specific poison, and
this poison becomes part
of
the blood and affects both
the mother and the nursing child.
Conclusion
The mere fact that you have this book is proof of your
interest in the birth of better and more perfect babies. You
may desire to become a mother of superior children; you may
have a daughter or friend in whom you are interested or, as
many others, you may simply enjoy knowing the Laws and
truths as here explained, so as to be able to give others the
benefit of your knowledge.
If you, yourself, desire to give birth to superior children,
it is in your power to do so, but you should not, for one
moment, consider the methods herein advocated as being
new or untried. Much of this knowledge has been known for
centuries. Even the Biblical writers were versed in at least
some of these methods, as is proven by the quotation from
Genesis, which you will find in this book.
The actual fact
is,
we have taught this system for the past
forty years
to
numerous women, not only
in
America, but
also
to
many living
in
other countries. This teaching, for
the most part, was carried through personal letters, and there
never has been
a
single instance
of
dissatisfaction
or
failure.
Those who have faithfully followed the instructions have
been more than satisfied. Many have voluntarily expressed
themselves
by
letter, telling us,
in
no
uncertain terms, that
the instructions have proven valuable beyond price.
On the day before these lines were written, we received
a
letter from one
of
these friends, telling
us
of
the wonderful
results obtained, enclosing
an
extra free gift
of
large propor
tion
in
expression
of
her appreciation.
130 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
It should perhaps be mentioned that these instructions
were originally prepared especially for the women who live
in the smaller towns and in outlying districts where it is
difficult, and often impossible, to obtain instructions and
guidance from a physician who has a true knowledge of the
Laws and methods which enable women to bring superior
children into the world. It has been our great pleasure to
help these splendid women, and through them, the race as a
whole.
THE CONSTANT, INSISTENT DEMAND BY THOSE WHO
RECEIVED THESE INSTRUCTIONS IN CONDENSED FORM, HAS
INDUCED US TO ISSUE THIS BOOK, SO THAT THESE, AS
WELL AS ALL WOMEN INTERESTED, CAN OBTAIN THIS IN
STRUCTION WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY AND WITH
THE COST OF THE BOOK AS THE ONLY OUTLAY OF MONEY.
As a result, you and your children may have the benefit of
this priceless information.
Dangerous Period of Life"
Menopause
ls AT puberty, the temple doors of the creative being
are opened so that God's universe may be peopled,
so at Menopause are they closed and if
all
has been
well, Nature bespeaks the benediction: "As thou
has been faithful despite
all
thy suffering, now
may thou know the joys
of
life without the shadow
of
fear.”
The period
of
a
woman's fruitful years are varied.
In
some
instances menstruation may commence
as
early
as
the age
of
nine
or
ten and continue until fifty.
In
others the lunar
season does not appear until the fifteenth
or
even the
eighteenth year, ceasing
at
thirty-five
to
thirty-eight.
Many conditions influence both the commencement and
the cessation. Heredity frequently governs, and the girl
whose mother changed from girlhood
to
womanhood after
reaching the age
of
fifteen, and from fertility into Menopause
at
thirty-eight, may expect the same rule
to
govern
in
her
life, although this
is
not always true.
Women who have borne children do not usually enter the
menopause
as
early
in
life
as
those who have not. As
a
(*) Before publication, the manuscripts for both PRENATAL CULTURE
and RACE REGENERATION: THE MYSTERY OF SEX were read by (1) phy
sicians interested
in
the subjects treated, (2) women who had been previous
ly
instructed along these lines, and (3) co-workers representing widely
different walks
of
life. These readers, almost without exception, expressed the
wish that this chapter from Race Regeneration
be
included
as
part
of
the
present volume — the physicians
so
that they might provide copies
to
patients
approaching the Menopause; the others, that they might present copies
to
their friends and loved ones
in
need
of
such guidance.
132 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
general rule, the more children a woman has had, the later
she may expect the "Change of Life” to occur.
A fallacy which has been universally accepted as a truth,
and from which we hope to free suffering womanhood, is the
race belief that as a woman approaches the years when meno
pause should occur, she will commence to suffer all the
misery, both physical and mental, that the flesh is heir
to.
Nothing need
be
further from the truth; physical ailments
and mental morbidity are not generally necessary and, when
present, merely indicate either ignorance
or
an
abnormal
life.
At this period
of
life the creative organism does undergo
a
change, the ovaries atrophying, reducing
in
size and ceasing
to
function
as
previously.
It
is
also generally believed that
the uterus, like the ovaries, will atrophy. No doubt this does
occur
in
some instances, but
it
is
entirely unnecessary.
If
the
laws governing woman's sexual life and activity are under
stood and obeyed, women undergoing menopause may remain
as
youthful
in
their desires and their capacity
to
exchange
the full love embrace with husbands
as
before the change,
and one
of
the chief causes
of
divorces
at
this period
of
life—
in
plain words, the wife's frigidity and lack
of
response—
will have been removed.
During the period when menopause takes place the entire
nervous system must undergo
a
thorough re-adjustment. One
of
the first symptoms
of
the approach
of
a
normal change
of
life
is
irregularity
in
menstruation. Sometimes the lunar
flow will
be
missed for several months. Then
it
may appear
regularly for some time; again ceasing for
a
shorter
or
longer
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 133
period. This continues until the process of reconstruction is
completed.
Undoubtedly, even in the strongest women who have lived
in obedience with natural laws, the various changes require
greater strength than did the monthly periods of cleansing.
Because of this, the food should be especially vitalizing and
free from congesting material, while the body should have
less active exercise and the mind longer hours of rest.
Teaching by illustration is by far the easiest method.
We recall the case of an average woman who, during her
youth, received no instructions in the care of her physical
organism; who refused all opportunities for gaining this im
portant knowledge. She was the mother of several children,
suffering severely when giving birth to most of them, by
reason of improper food, worry, overwork and many other
unnatural and unnecessary factors.
This woman is now in her fourth year of the change. A
day or two before the commencement of the flow there is a
disturbance of the stomach, then a bilious headache so severe
it becomes necessary for her to go to bed. This headache may
continue twenty-four to forty-eight hours. During this time
she is practically unable to see, so great is her suffering.
Then the flow of an odorous fluid commences and con
tinues for possibly five or six days. The woman is irritable,
at times extremely nervous, and next to irrational. From
present appearances, the change will not be completed for
another year or two. Our experience indicates that, with
slight variations, this is the usual “hell of middle life”
through which most women pass.
We also have in mind an acquaintance, a woman who was
blessed with an enlightened mother by whom she was fully
134 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
instructed during her girlhood years. This lady no longer
believes that she need be ashamed of any portion of her body,
but feels that she has a perfect right to be proud of
it.
She has long since thrown into discard the age-old idea
that she
is
the plaything
of
her husband, with
no
right
to
refuse his request,
or
indicate her desires; also the belief that
when she passes through the gates
of
the menopause she will
no
longer
be
a
desirable companion for her husband, and
incapable
of
offering him the pleasures
of
youth.
This lady, the mother
of
nine children,
at
the age
of
forty
eight, had neither
a
thought nor
an
indication
of
the ap
proaching crisis until the lunar flow ceased
to
appear.
A
day
or
two after the period when menstruation should have com
menced she was aware
of
slightly hot flushes and
a
desire
to
rest.
Instead
of
giving way
to
worry, woman's usual companion,
she took
a
warm douche,
a
tepid bath with
a
quick rub,
a
hot
cup
of
tea and went
to
bed.
In
a
few hours these flushes
passed and she felt wide-awake, though slightly nervous.
In
place
of
asking for
an
opiate, she dressed and took
a
long
walk, swinging her arms and breathing deeply.
For the next few days she changed her diet
to
luscious
fruits and fresh green vegetables, such
as
lettuce, celery, corn,
peas, and plenty
of
milk and fresh eggs. During the time
of
what had formerly been the lunar season she abstained
from meats, sweets, spices and stimulating drinks.
The next periodical flow appeared
as
usual, but she con
tinued the former treatment. After
an
intermittent appear
ance for about
a
year, the flow ceased entirely and for six
months past there has been
no
indication
of
its
ever again
appearing.
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 135
During
all
of
this period she never for
a
moment per
mitted herself the thought that now she would
be
less
a
woman
or
less desirable
to
her husband, but remained firm
in
the belief that there should
be
no
change
in
the conjugal
relationship, and acted accordingly. As
a
result, her husband
was barely aware
of
the change taking place. This
is
the
natural way
ofthe change.
Cases vary even when
an
enlightened regime
is
faithfully
followed, but
it
is
safe
to
say that every abnormal and un
desirable symptom can
be
quickly overcome
by
rest, abstain
ing from certain foods, taking proper exercises and
a
correct
outlook
on
life, and adopting such remedial agents
as
may
be
necessary.
-
Generally, the greatest enemies woman must contend with
during the menopause are indigestion, dyspepsia, sluggish
ness
of
the liver, over-work, abnormal indulgence
in
food
and drink, unhygienic surroundings, etc.
Ifthese
be
removed
and normal habits
of
life established, there need be no reason
for worry.
It
is
a
universally accepted delusion that with the cessation
of
the periodic flow, woman naturally ceases
to
enjoy the
embraces
of
her husband, and
is
no
longer capable
of
con
ferring upon him the former satisfaction, supposedly due
to
the atrophying
of
the ovaries, and shrinking
of
the vaginal
walls. This
is
a
race belief which has been the cause of more
misery, sorrow, broken hearts and disrupted homes, than
almost all other combined influences.
This thought, always present
in
the mind
of
woman long
before the time
of
the approaching change, has been
a
“thorn
in
the flesh.” Many women look forward, with dire forebod
ing,
to
the period when the fires-of-love—keen desire—will
136 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
no longer burn within her and she will become incapable
of giving the former pleasure to the man she loves, with the
altogether natural expectation that he will seek satisfaction
elsewhere than at his own fireside.
This constant fear and expectation unquestionably have
much to do with the unnatural and undesirable change taking
place, as well as with the gradual decline of the woman's
desire for the usual love embrace, so that by the time the
“change of life” is actually completed, her entire organism,
no less than her desires and capabilities, have become para
lyzed and she becomes frigid in her nature, totally at variance
with her former self.
There comes to us the psychological law expressed in the
Bible as a religious truth: “The thing thou feared has come
upon thee,” and nowhere else in Nature is the working of the
law more certain than in the domain of the emotional nature.
As a matter of absolute—and saving—truth, we can assure
every woman living that there is no foundation for this
destructive race belief. She may avoid becoming a victim of
this inertia. She can, if she will, become many times more
capable of both experiencing and giving affectional pleasure
after the menopause, than during any other period of her
life, with the possible exception of the first few times she per
mitted the embrace.
If a woman will keep the affectional fires burning while
passing through the change of life by willingly, and with
conscious desire, accepting the conjugal embrace at least
once a week between the lunar periods, being watchful that
she experiences the complete climax in
its
highest perfection
each time, she will not only keep the love nature alive and
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 137
fully awakened, but she will delay the atrophying process of
the ovaries and the shrinking of both uterus and the vaginal
walls; becoming thereby capable of giving more intense and
prolonged pleasure to her spouse than ever before, because
the constant fear of pregnancy will have been entirely
removed.
Up to a comparatively very short time ago it was thought
that only women passed through a change of life. Physicians,
like the laity, labored under this belief. Now we know that
men, as well as women, pass through such a change and at
about the same age. The symptoms are very much alike in
both instances:
Uncertainty and a growing lack of faith in one's ability
often makes
its
appearance. This symptom
is
more pro
nounced
in
men than
in
women. The fear
of
becoming
incompetent; mental depression;
a
seeming dullness
of
memory and the inability
to
concentrate as well
as
for
merly, are usually more pronounced
in
men than
in
women. Other common symptoms are: Lassitude and
inertia;
a
desire for inaction; palpitation
of
the heart;
asthma
or
other ailments heretofore unknown, and fears
of
various kinds, all without actual reason. Danger
is
frequently sensed, though none
is
present. Men easily
become excited or worried without actual cause. Numb
ness, due
to
a
decrease
of
circulation, may
be
felt; nerves
may
be
taut and "on edge” much
of
the time. There
is
frequently
a
loss
of
interest
in
things formerly considered
essential
to
life and happiness—a sense
of
failure and
insecurity. Irritability and loss
of
control are often ex
perienced, even
in
trifling, inconsequential affairs. There
138 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
may be a lack of Libido, i.e., the former urge for sexual
relationship. In fact, this may become pronounced; more
so in men than in women.
In general, Nature is giving warning that insofar as she
is concerned, she is withdrawing from the scene; that the
parties concerned will be obliged to follow other than
former methods, and bring other forces into play if they
wish to remain competent and fulfill the role of true men
and women.
WHY SHOULD THIS BE so? Why is it that, up to the
years of forty or forty-five, the normal, healthy man is moved
by a sex urge almost beyond control, and supplied with the
vim and vitality to indulge inordinately, and then—almost
overnight—becomes apathetic and indifferent? Why is it
that the woman, who formerly had to be aroused by fondling
and caressing, may now be an entirely different nature?
Why all this change?
It is as though a man had been sustained for many years
to a point near heaven by some force or power, other than his
own, and permitted, aye, even urged, to enjoy life to the full
without personal effort, and then, suddenly being cut off, as
it were, in mid-air, with the stipulation: "If it be your desire
to enjoy what has been yours for so many years, YOUR PER
SONAL EFFORT MUST COMPENSATE FOR THAT WHICH
WAS FREELY GIVEN YOU UPTILL NOW. If you fail to make
this effort, and make it constantly, then
all
that has been
yours will
be
lost
to
you.”
Nature
is
utterly selfish. She concerns herself solely and
wholly with her own interests. Beginning with adoles
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 139
cence she sets into motion certain emotional longings and
desires which automatically create forces and energies that
MUST find activities and outlets in one form or another,
and the most "natural” is the biological urge—desire for
exercise of the libido. This desire, almost incessant, is an
incentive not so much to create as to enjoy and satisfy the
urge. Nature is wise in this respect, because it assures her
continued creation of the species. In man, this is a carnal
turge which Nature instigates and keeps active so long as
it serves her. In woman the desire is aroused by love's
activity, or what she believes and accepts as such; induced
by petting, fondling and coaxing. Man is the tempter;
woman the tempted.
During this period, effort, on the part of man, except in
direction of self-control, is unnecessary. Whatever efforts
he exerts are to hold his emotional urges in check, rather
than arouse or awaken them.
But all things must come to an end. There comes a time
when Nature has obtained from man all she desires or all
of which he is capable. His days of virility over, Nature
arranges thus:
"Up to the present time I have given you all the power
and energy required to enjoy yourself to such degree that you
have been unable to resist the urge within you. I, Nature,
have been the incentive of your acts. I have been your
'devil' of pleasure. You, in turn, have been the tempter of
your mate. Between you, you have served me well. You
are now no longer useful to me; hence I sever my connection
with you and yours. IF YOU DESIRE TO REMAIN A man,
140 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
AND YOUR MATE A woman, then YOU MUST HENCEFORTH
DO FOR YOURSELF THAT WHICH I HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE
FOR YOU.”
NATURE IS CRUEL, BUT IN HER OWN WAY SHE IS ALSO
MERCIFUL TO MAN THOUGH HE IS GENERALLY UNAWARE
OF IT. ALTHOUGH SHE FORSAKES HIM AT THIS CRITICAL
MOMENT, SHE DOES NOT ENTIRELY LEAVE HIM HELPLESS.
HE STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY, AND THE ABILITY, TO
DO FOR HIMSELF EveRYTHING THAT SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY
DONE FOR HIM with the exception of the capability of
procreation.
At this stage of life, what is man (this includes women)
to do? Nature gave man his virility in order that he might
enjoy himself freely, and, as a result, procreate the race.
God gave man something far greater than that which
Nature did—HIS IMAGINATION. When the INCENTIVE
of nature is withdrawn, the IMAGINATION MUST STEP
IN AND TAKE ITS PLACE.
One of the first symptoms of the oncoming “change” is
the lack of the libido on man's part, and the loss of desire
to be aroused on her part. THIS IS AN INERTIA WHICH
IS DEATH IF PERMITTED TO CONTINUE. This inertia is
truly a prolific source of excuses: too tired; business has
been difficult; I have a headache; my back hurts. Although
there is a feeling of guilt, each has a pet excuse with the
result that instead of bringing the imagination into play
to arouse the desire for embrace, they turn about and go
to sleep, and weakness is added to weakness.
It is truism: “Constant watchfulness is the price to be
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 141
paid for continued MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD.” Both
husband and wife should have a full understanding of the
mysteries of their being, comprehending both their
strength and their weakness and work in harmony with
each other. They must become fully conscious of the fact
that since Nature will permit their virility to die out, it is
incumbent on their part to MAKE THE NECESSARY EF
FORT TO KEEP THEMSELVES SEXUALLY AWAKE, ACTIVE,
ALIVE. They should agree that, if their own physical
natures will not respond automatically to a desire for the
marital embrace, they will bring the Imagination—God's
greatest gift to mankind—into activity. This should be
done no less than once a week.
This is most readily accomplished by retrospection—by
looking into the past and recalling to mind some excep
tionally pleasant experience of the marital pleasure which
was unforgettable. In doing this, the imaginative faculty
will do what Nature formerly did for them: SEND THE
BLOOD COURSING THROUGH THE PROCREATIVE ORGAN
ISM; AROUSING THE DESIRES AND BRINGING BACK THE
ABILITY TO ENJOY THE EMBRACE AS FULLY AS BEFORE.
If this method is followed from the very beginning when
Nature ceases to give help, then within a short period
of time, a NEW CYCLE OF AN AFFECTIONAL NATURE
IS ESTABLISHED and the libido on his part, and the
response on hers, will become natural and automatic, and
life will go on as before.
Question: Is it worth the effort? Is a man man enough
to do what is necessary to remain a man? Does the
142 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
woman possess enough affection to make the necessary
effort to continue a worthy object of affection? These
are questions every individual must answer for himself
or herself.
If we can be successful in spreading this law of nature
broadcast so that
all
men and women may come
to
an
under
standing
of
its
potency for the continued retention
of
youth,
then countless homes that would otherwise
be
disrupted,
will continue happy and content
in
the knowledge that all
is
well.
Let every man and woman look forward
to
a
greater
fulfillment
of
life after the menopause, giving extra care and
attention
to
the entire system while passing through the
change, keeping alive the entire being-mind, body and
Soul—by recreation; the mental faculties awake and active,
the body virile through exercise. Let them attend good plays,
associate with refined, cheerful people; enjoy life; never
mention the change that
is
taking place, except
to
the physi
cian; consistently refuse
to
recognize
a
morbid side
of
life.
Let them eat only those foods which will continue
to
re
build the mental and nervous system; creating the vital
forces
to
maintain balance and equilibrium.
Once the change has been completed, she may
no
longer
require the extra strength and vitality previously necessary
for her well-being; nor will she need
to
recover the loss
sustained every month
by
the lunar flow; thus will she
be
stronger, capable
of
greater effort, and possess the power
of
showing deeper affection for her husband.
A
serious error
of
the past, and one still prevalent,
is
the
BY PRENATAL INFLUENCE 143
generally accepted opinion that menopause is a disease; an
evil from which there is no escape. Undoubtedly, there has
been good reason for such a conclusion, because those who
previously enjoyed health, strength and marital pleasures
no sooner enter upon the change in life—for such it is—
than they become afflicted with various ailments and weak
nesses, all more or less serious in themselves, and becoming
more serious if neglected.
Menopause is an entirely natural functional change from
creative usefulness to creative rest. Instead of heralding
disease, misery and, not infrequently, life-long suffering, it
should be, and can be, the herald of health and strength;
a time for the enjoyment of the fruits of the past period of
life.
During the change of life, any latent weakness that had
not been actively manifested previously may exhibit itself
and at a time when the system is unprepared for the extra
strain. Instead of displaying wisdom and seeking the actual
cause, usually to be found in lack of exercise, indulgence in
congesting foods, overwork, unsanitary conditions, unwhole
some surroundings and sexual abuses, the menopause is
blamed for
it.
Actually, menopause has nothing whatever
to
do
with such weakness
or
suffering other than possibly
furnishing
an
avenue for their manifestation.
The change
of
life should never
be
an
occasion for fear
and dread, but should rather
be
welcomed
as
an
opportunity
for greater peace and contentment;
a
deeper mental, physi
cal, and spiritual satisfaction.
If
harmony has been estab
lished
in
the system, menopause will proceed normally and
144 CREATING THE PERFECT BABY
the body will enjoy freedom from many of
its
former weak
IneSSeS.
One fact cannot
be
too strongly impressed upon the mind
of
every woman, namely:
if
afflicted with what
is
usually
termed "female weakness,” she will suffer more
or
less
during the change unless corrective measures are taken, and
should hardly expect the change itself
to
be
a
cure-all,
or
the means
of
freeing her from such ailments.
In
fact, the
change
of
life may even intensify the condition; establish
chronic invalidism, hysterical, nervous
or
irrational mo
ments with the result that life will be made miserable for
her and all members
of
the family.
Recommendation: Immediately after itbecomes apparent
that the "change”
is
beginning
or
has commenced,
a
reliable
physician should
be
consulted; blood count checked; blood
pressure taken; cardiograph and
a
urinalysis made.
