The drop was more than 150 feet deep.  This event was witnessed by my companions and my teacher. From where I fell, I could hear my best friend calling to find where I was. I was replying but he could not hear me. I saw him reach the spot and I saw my teacher lifting me in his arms. I also saw the ambulance arrive by road and park at the edge of the forest. I saw the paramedics get out of their vehicles. I did speak to my teacher, but no one could hear me, and from where I fell, it would be impossible to see everything I saw, as I was right inside the forest with my view cut off, and unconscious.

I remained in a coma for a half day then woke up. I was covered with injuries. For the people around me I have completely changed in character. According to the paramedics it was a miracle that I survived. I have never forgotten this experience.
