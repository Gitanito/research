 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Mahatma</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Mahatma.
 The Only Paper in the United States devoted to the Interests of Magicians, Spiritualists, Mesmerists, etc.
 1895-1906  Monthly
 New York, NY.  Editor: Walter G. Peterkin, editor and publisher.
 Corporate author:  Society of American Magicians1/1, 1895-1906, with a hiatus between November 1895 and February 1898.

 Despite its promising title, this is a stage-magic journal, but the close relationship with phenomenal spiritualism is obvious in the advertisements for magical apparatus.  It also featured a series of articles on the development of American prestidigitation by Henry Ridgely Evans, who was himself a trained magician.  Rowell's American Newspaper Directory for 1900 says the journal was spiritualist and was started in 1898 and had a circulation of less than 1,000.
