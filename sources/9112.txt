  		              		Experience Description   

    I was raised by my grandparents. My family is of Chinese descent but I was born in the United Kingdom. I was very close to my grandma but she died when I was 15. My grandfather had always spent all his time in his own bedroom, so it was like I was living on my own.  I found this a real struggle, especially for the last 2 years of high school.  
  
  In 1991, I was age 16 and had stayed home from  school for 2 weeks with unknown illness. It felt like an intense flu but I was in severe cough and pain all over. It started as a  mild flu, so I used over-the-counter medicines to ease the symptoms. Then these medications were no longer working and the symptoms got worse.   I was unable to move and was confined to my bed  in such pain and with strong headaches. I remember screaming out in agony during those few days because I felt so much pain. My grandfather kept to himself. During those 2 weeks, he would occasionally pop his head through my door tell me to 'quiet down' and to ask if I had taken my medications.  
  
  It was still daylight in the  mid-afternoon. All of a sudden, I felt very light in weight and as if I were levitating toward the ceiling in my room. Then in a matter of seconds, I was shooting upwards in a very straight line at a very fast speed. It was like in cartoons when something is traveling so fast and you see things giving off lines. I couldn't see outwards though because it was like I was moving in a long tube.   
  
  Then, everything stopped because I had reached the destination. although I had been traveling fast, I didn't feel any motion sickness. In fact, I felt very at ease. I wasn't in any pain and I wasn't ill. This sounds corny, but it felt PERFECT. I felt total bliss, like I was very happy. I felt like I had no worries and no stress. This feeling intensified and at the same time, I was enveloped in a bright light. It felt like the light should be too bright for my eyes, however I had no need to squint. The only word I can best describe this light is the word 'beautiful.' I don't really know why I use that word because it's not a word I ever really use in my day to day life.  
  
  The very next thing that happened made me extremely emotional. My grandma who had passed a year before, was right in front of me. I burst into tears. I cried and sobbed. I had missed her so much and now she was here in front of me. I didn't see her like I used to see her. I just knew it was her without any doubt whatsoever. She was almost glowing within the bright, beautiful light that surrounded me. In my mind, I could see her face and body. But in reality she was more like a shimmer.     At this point,  with everything feeling so peaceful,  perfect, and so 'beautiful,'  I knew belonged here. I didnt want to ever leave my grandma again. My mind was made up and  I was staying.  
  
  My grandma was in front of me  and all I wanted to do was get closer to her, to touch her, and to be with her. I tried to move forward, but I couldn't. There was a blockage preventing  me from reaching her and at this same time, I heard a male voice that was loud and very deep. I'm not sure where the voice came from because it was so pervasive. It could have come from everywhere, from all around me, as if it was paired with the surrounding light.  I  tilted my head to listen to the voice, so it could have been coming from above me, or from the sides. I'm not sure.  
  
  With his rich deep, powerful voice, he said, 'NO! It's not your time. You must go back.'  
  
  'Go back? No way! My grandma is here. I belong here, I am staying!'  
  
  Again he spoke, 'It's not your time.'  
  
  With every bit of strength within me I tried to fight coming back. Against his wishes, I moved  closer to my grandma but still I couldn't reach her. She was getting further and further away from me. It was as if someone was holding my body back as I tried to run ahead.     I was overcome with epic sadness at the thought of never seeing grandma again. I was so upset and I pleaded and I begged 'Please! I want to stay! Please!!'  
  
  The very next moment, I found myself in the exact same tube or tunnel that brought me to that destination. But this time, I was traveling in reverse so now I was speedily heading downwards instead of upwards. There were no junctions, no corners, and no pitstops. It was a direct, straight line that led me back to my starting position. As I was approaching my body, everything slowed down. With a gentle thud, I was now realigned and back in my bed in my bedroom.  
  
  I sat up,  looked around me, and I was feeling very confused.  Very slowly my real life took over. It took me almost a minute to realize that my grandma really is deceased and I won't ever see her again.  But I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just met her moments ago.  
  
  My body pains returned, my cough returned, and another new headache was starting to surface. I wondered, 'What on earth just happened?' I was very overwhelmed with the whole experience and I couldn't comprehend it at all. The high energy levels I had just moments ago had all now dissipated, making me very tired.  I continued as before with my illness and its symptoms.  
  
  Weeks passed and I was back at school. The experience was at the forefront of my mind as I had so many questions and no answers.   
  
What happened?   

Where did I go? Who spoke to me?   

Why was I not allowed to stay there?   

Was that really my grandma I saw?   

What was the light and why was it beautiful?   

Why did it happen when it did?   

Was it connected to a religion?   

Did I leave my body?   

Why did I return?   

Why did the bright light not hurt my eyes?   

Why did I not see a floor or ceiling or walls?   

What did he mean by 'its not your time'?   

How come I had to stand by his decision?   

  Will I go back?   
  
  Will  it happen again?   
  
Will I be allowed to touch and hug my grandma next time?   

  Will there be a next time?  
  
When will I find the answers to my questions?   

Did I dream everything?   

Was I daydreaming?   

Why can I still remember every single detail so vividly?  

Do other people also experience this too when they are ill?   

Is this what happens when we die?   

Did I die?   

Is my death already predicted?   

Is there a heaven and a hell?  

If this was heaven, then what is hell like?  

  I never spoke about this to anyone. I figure people will tell me its just a dream, but I knew in my heart it wasn't a dream.  Nine years later, when I was 25 years old,  I was flicking through my TV channels and I stopped  when my screen showed a panel of several people who were discussing experiences that were similar to mine.   
  
  Then, I knew for certain that it was not my imagination! For almost 10 years, I thought I was on my own but now I finally had some kind of confirmation that I was not insane.  I discovered my experience  was called a near-death axperience. As this was the very first time in my life that I had heard anyone else talk about this, it was very overwhelming to hear so many similarities and knowing that my own version could not have been influenced by anyone.  
  
  The internet did not become a household item until a few years later, so I couldn't just switch my computer on and ask Google about NDEs. I had still never spoken about it properly to anyone. The subject may have come up in a few conversations but I had never met anyone who had gone through something like this.   However, I have always felt like I shouldn't investigate further, even when the internet exploded. This is the first time I have written about my experience and reached out to a website dedicated to NDEs. For some reason, it just feels like it is  the right time. I don't know why now though because common sense would say at 43 years old, I should have done so within the last 25 years.  
  
  I still have all the same questions and I still don't have  answers.  My NDE is still as vivid now as it was 25 years ago, but I do hope that now I have finally particpated with the NDE community that I may finally find some answers. Better late than never, right?   
  
  I am very grateful for giving me this opportunity to share my NDE. I really do appreciate it. Thank you.
