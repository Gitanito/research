yes the how do you know you won&#39;t get a
national-security
order very good question and this
actually came up very recently when we
were meeting with the group of folks in
New York and I said maybe I will but if
it&#39;s on camera I mean I remember Ted
Koppel of a Nightline asked me this and
I said well I&#39;ll come on a show like
yours and tear it up but the other part
of it that I didn&#39;t talk about is having
millions of people know what you&#39;re
doing because here&#39;s a bit of Aikido
this group is like they&#39;re like vampires
they do really well in the darkness of
secrecy they do not writ large want to
be caught in a bright billions what
spotlight which we have in a sense
created or on what we&#39;re doing for
better or for worse for my privacy it&#39;s
for worse but for other reasons it&#39;s
very good because if they were to do
such a clownish thing and the cameras
are rolling at a lab or it did it that
would be exposed widely that that there
is a group operating off the reservation
that has tried to do a national security
order or made an overt threat or
what-have-you
so I think that the public and I say
this sincerely you all sharing the word
on this and everyone on on YouTube
sharing this interview the public
ultimately is our shield and it is
probably why we&#39;re all still here
because the public knowing what we&#39;re
doing is protective you know if you go
to the National Reconnaissance Office
that runs all these super-secret space
satellites their headquarters above the
door says we own the night and I always
say well we own the light we own
disclosure so they can own the night
we&#39;ll own the light and so you don&#39;t if
you don&#39;t agree to play on the field of
secrecy you can transcend it and go stay
in the field of telling the truth and
being out there but it has to be done
with lots of people coming together
that&#39;s the beauty of what we can do now
with the internet in communication
systems and the apt and what have you so
that is our first line of strategic
defense it&#39;s counterintuitive and almost
every technology person I know who&#39;s
worked on this and almost everyone who&#39;s
wanted to do funding of this sort of
energy technology has wanted to do it
secretly because they think they&#39;re
going to outfox the national security
state I said oh no you&#39;re not you&#39;re you
think you&#39;re the world&#39;s gonna beat a
path to your door and you&#39;re gonna you
know be this mogul like you know Steve
Jobs was for Apple no I said before the
public beats the path your door murder
incorporated is going to meet a path to
your door so you&#39;ve got to do this with
your eyes wide open and do it very
openly and the intellectual property
secrecy patent route I think is maybe
later
I hope we don&#39;t have to go back to that
but for various applications but the
fundamental science and technology got
to be open source
but then when it is and it&#39;s been
reproduced and you have thousands of
these devices going out one of our plans
as some of the celebrities that have
followed our work I don&#39;t want a name is
to have their homes running on an
imagined someone on the cover of People
magazine you know so at a certain point
you get this out there and you just sort
of you&#39;ll get a fun so you have a couple
hundred of them made and you gift them
to the right people in academic
institutions celebrities pop culture
icons
rock music stars that I&#39;ve met be pretty
cool and that you can that&#39;s very hard I
mean the hidebound at harvard may not
talk about it
but I suspect steven seagal wood or bono
of u2 right so I you know you can read
between the lines and I think that&#39;s
where the public coming together but
using a strategy the strategy we have is
a really complex strategy but it&#39;s
really when it gets right down to it
very very simple and that is you do it
out there fully in the open and
that way you&#39;re most protected and
disagree you&#39;re doing anything
secretively you&#39;re a great risk it&#39;s
very counterintuitive because it&#39;s not
what people normally do with science and
technology
