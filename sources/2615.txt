About this time there had been a growing

6 PSYCHIC POWERS
Already by the last quarter of the century
much harm had been done, both in the dis-
astrous effect on mediums themselves, and
in the tremendous interest that had been
aroused in every and any sort of abnormal
power. A glamour had been cast over it all
and many were feverishly hunting after the
most unwholesome sorts of inner develop-
ment with complete ignorance of the nature
of what they were after.
Part of the mission of the Theosophical
Society, founded in 1875, was to call a halt
to this mad rush for phenomena and powers.
This was to be done principally in two ways:
(a) By trying to illumine the hearts and
minds of men with a spiritual light which
so far transcended the will-o’-the-wisp ﬂick-
erings of psychism, that the latter would lose
their fascination.

Never were the phenomena presented in any
other character than that of instances of a power
over perfectly natural though unrecognised forces,
and incidentally over matter, possessed by certain
individuals who have attained to a larger and higher
knowledge of the Universe than has been reached
by scientists and theologians, or can ever be reached
by them, by the roads they are now respectively
pursuing. Yet this power is latent in all men, and
could, in time, be wielded by anyone who would
cultivate the knowledge and conform to the con-
ditions necessary for its development.
She continues:
Therefore, it is hardly to be wondered at, that
word came to abandon phenomena and let the ideas
of Theosophy stand on their own intrinsic merits.

FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS
THE nature of the psychic powers and
faculties cannot be understood without
a comprehension of certain basic concep-
tions. These are as necessary as charts are
in sailing an unfamiliar sea.
First we must dismiss the idea that any-
thing can be brought about by supernatural
means. No divine being can suspend the
working of natural law. On the other hand,
neither can we say with the materialists that
everything can be explained by the laws of
physical nature alone.

that there is indeed more to the universe

There is, in fact, a constant interchange
between what we call the physical plane and
the astral plane. No sharp dividing line
exists between the ﬁnest grade of physical
matter and the densest grade of astral sub-
stance. The one merges into the other as
naturally as dark night merges into dawn.
This fact, with all that it implies, plays a
large part in the explanation of the phe-
nomena of memory, hallucination, emotional
‘complexes,’ psychoses, and the dozens of
other problems of mind and consciousness
that puzzle the psychologists. And it has
to be reckoned with in the study of every
aspect of psychism. The psychic waves that
sweep over portions of the earth at cyclic
times are caused, we are told, when through
certain stresses and tensions in the earth’s
constitution, the protecting veils between the
two planes grow thin, and contact with these
ﬁner substances is more easily made by
peculiarly constituted individuals.

that the ego within really hears, sees, tastes,

senses would be useless. But at present

dependent upon their physical replicas.
We cannot use them consciously and inde-

The fact is that for every one of our
physical senses we have an astral counter-
part which is the true center of sense per-
ception. It is through these astral centers
that the ego within really hears, sees, tastes,
and touches. Without them, the physical
senses would be useless. But at present
these astral sense-centers are in their turn
dependent upon their physical replicas.
We cannot use them consciously and inde-
pendently as yet. This will come in the
future as a further stage of development.
When that time comes it will be natural for
us to use these astral senses at will, and

imagines that he is being led to the perform-
ance of great deeds by some angelic guide.
He hears ‘voices,’ he is said to be ‘clair-
voyant,’ and in touch with ‘spiritual’ powers,
while all the time his own hallucination is
feeding his sense of superiority. It would
seem that a knowledge of the true nature
of the psyche and the possibility of its ‘dis-
location’ in the human constitution-—one
of the commonest evidences of mediumship
—would be an enormous help to the psy-
chologist in studying such cases.
While it is freely admitted by many that
Western psychology is still in its infancy,
in its application to the practical affairs of
everyday life, such as education and indus-
try, excellent work is being done. But it
is obvious that, whereas ‘psychologization’
is freely taught and used, very little is known
of the true nature of this psychic power.

PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIC POWERS 41
It has become such a common thing now
to believe that it is a good action and a
sign of strength of character to force one’s
own ideas or convictions upon others, that
clever methods for doing so are ever on the
increase. The very word ‘psychologize’ has
come to have this exclusive meaning, though
its technical meaning is, of course, ‘to
analyse psychologically.’ If it is argued that
success in college or in business depends
upon the use of this power, then we can
only answer that that in itself is a sad com-
mentary on present-day standards. A real
psychologist might analyse this ignoble prac-
tice as an attempt, by illicit means, to bring
about what the man of high integrity,
character and genius, accomplishes through
the compelling power of truth and of his
innate spiritual strength. True greatness re-
quires no psychological tricks to enhance it.

‘sensitives’ in the séance-room. And since
a great many types of psychic powers are
linked up with this matter, and their origin
very little understood, it is worthwhile devot-

Speaking in a broad and general sense, we

(e) Certain unusual cases exist where
authenticcommunicationhas been made with
the spirit of a departed friend. This does
not mean the descent of such spirit. It im-
plies that the medium’s Higher Ego is on
the same high plane as the disembodied
spirit and can thus contact it.‘ The medium
must be absolutelypure, and then his Higher
Ego, untrammeled by an impure psychic
vehicle, “has the opportunity and facility
of influencing the passive organs of its en-
tranced physical body, to make them act,
speak, and write at its will. The Ego can
make it repeat, echo—like, and in the human
language, the thoughts and ideas of the dis-
embodied entity, as well as its own.”*

wise rare occurrences of contact between the

under the term poltergeist, a German word
meaning literally ‘racketing spirit.’ This
term is quite accurate, but scientists have
adopted it without accepting its signiﬁcance,
since they do not recognise the existence of
‘spirits.’ When they do not dismiss such
occurrences with some mechanical explana-

untraceable origin.”

HYPNOTISM
CLOSELY associated with the general
topic of mediumship is that of hyp-
notism, since the subject of the hypnotizer’s
experiments becomes in a very real sense a
medium: his will is temporarily paralysed
and often permanently weakened, and his
psychic nature becomes a passive receiver
of the foreign will-force it is subjected to.
H. P. Blavatsky speaks of Hypnotism as
the “illegitimate son of Mesmerism.” This
indicates that a distinction is actually to be
made between the two, though in early Theo-
sophical literature the terms are sometimes
used interchangeably.

a number of clairvoyants about some event
of nation-wide interest bear out the em-

the uncertain character of all such sources

made of the strong temptation to deception
and fraud risked by those professed psy-

always functioning.
Besides this matter of unreliability, which
often may lead others astray, there are the
more serious dangers to the clairvoyant him-
self. It is signiﬁcant that a large majority of
clairvoyants suffer from nervous and other
physical disorders, and from mental insta-

often increases proportionally to their ill-

of thought. The mass of twaddle put out

106 PSYCHIC POWERS
In India, where the mysteries of the psy-
chic nature have been studied for many ages,
such type of automatic writing has always
been ascribed to bhutas, astral remnants of
former human beings. And the practice has
always been warned against, since it leaves
one passive to whatever astral entities may
I
ﬁnd an afﬁnity in one s psychic make-up.
There is, however, another type of auto-
matic writing which is described by G. de
Purucker as follows:
This kind is wholesome, good, and proper to cul-
tivate if you have a wise and reliable Teacher.
Otherwise you will almost inevitably slip on the
path. This other kind of automatic writing can
occur when the higher part of the human constitu-
tion becomes the controlling factor for an hour or
two or three mayhap. The human being then is
no longer conscious of his physical personality at
all; he has transcended that; he has raised himself,
has become for the time being almost at one with
the god within, and in these circumstances his hand
writes what may actually be a very message from
his own spiritual nature.

106 PSYCHIC POWERS
In India, where the mysteries of the psy-
chic nature have been studied for many ages,
such type of automatic writing has always
been ascribed to blzzitas, astral remnants of
former human beings. And the practicehas
always been warned against, since it leaves
one passive to whatever astral entities may
find an affinity in one’s psychic make-up.
There is, however, another type of auto-
matic writing which is described by G. de
Purucker as follows:
This kind is wholesome, good, and proper to cul-
tivate if you have a wise and reliable Teacher.
Otherwise you will almost inevitably slip on the
path. This other kind of automatic writing can
occur when the higher part of the human constitu-
tion becomes the controlling factor for an hour or
two or three mayhap. The human being then is
no longer conscious of his physical personality at
all; he has transcended that; he has raised himself,
has become for the time being almost at one with
the god within, and in these circumstances his hand
writes what may actually be a very message from
his own spiritual nature.

To establish contact with the spiritual
source of one’s own being requires not only
technical training, but a prepared vehicle as
well. It was through such training and prep-
aration that H. P. Blavatsky was able to
become the channel for the writing of large
portions of her books by her own Teachers.
She was able at any moment to receive their
‘call to attention’; and hints that she her-

For instance, it is undoubtedly the element
of prophecy that makes clairvoyance so fas-
cinating to many people. To be able to
cheat time, so to speak, becomes almost a
passion with some. Yet such attempts to
glimpse into the future, when successful
bring dissatisfaction, unrest, a centering of
attention upon oneself, and a general loss
of equilibrium; when unsuccessful, they are
futile indeed.
The true clairvoyant power, on the other
hand, which takes its beginnings in unselﬁsh
love, brings with it no such unhappy results.
It is a power used at will by the master
of life; in us it feebly manifests as ﬂashes
of intuitions, ‘hunches,’ warnings in dreams,

THE THEOSOPHICAL OBJECTIVE
WHEN the Theosophical Society was
founded in 1875, those who were at-
tracted to this ‘new’ and original organi-
zation naturally interpreted its objectives
in the light of their own understanding and
according to their degree of enlightenment.
If, as they understood, there existed a great
Brotherhood of exalted Men who possessed
amazing power over the forces of man and
nature, and who were guardians of a great
treasury of knowledge accumulated through
the ages, then here was the opportunity of
a lifetime to receive development along ‘oc-

and wayward, more sensitive to the mag-
netic pull upwards towards its spiritual par-
ent within. Discrimination, a quality of the
spirit, begins to develop. The purpose of
life takes on a new and profounder signifi-
cance. The mystery of the One Life flow-
ing through all beings gradually turns one
away from the small attentions of the per-
sonal self to embrace a wider circle of sym-
pathies and interests.
By such gradual development one be-
comes prepared to take a further step. No
one who is ready is ever denied the oppor-
tunity to advance. The Theosophical So-
ciety has provided in this cycle such an op-
portunity. Yet it was not methods for de-
veloping powers that the Mahatmans who
founded the Society offered. Powers fasci-
nate the human mind because to us, how-
ever spiritually conceived, they imply the
abilityto have somethingfor ourself; to rise
above our fellows; to excel rather than to

We do entertain altruistic ideals; but the
higher forms of selﬁshness are very subtle
indeed, and altruistic motives are very easi-

that grows pari passu with our psychic, or,

What the Theosophical Society offers is
an opportunity to all lovers of humanity to
do altruistic work, illuminated by the light
of a comprehensive philosophy which ex-
plains the causes of the miseries and in-
equalities in the world. It was founded to
help direct altruism along constructive chan-
nels, and to show that whole-hearted co-
operation in such work was the safest way
to higher development. The dynamic ener-

Then the Society will live on into and through
the twentieth century. It will gradually leaven and
permeate the great mass of thinking and intelligent
people with its large-minded and noble ideas of
Religion, Duty, and Philanthropy. Slowly but sure-
ly it will burst asunder the iron fetters of creeds
and dogmas, of social and caste prejudices; it will
break down racial and national antipathies and bar-
riers, and will open the way to the practical realisa-
tion of the Brotherhood of all men. . . . Further,
the development of the psychic powers and facul-
ties, the premonitory symptoms of which are al-
ready visible in America, will proceed healthily and
normally. Mankind will be saved from the terrible
dangers, both mental and bodily, which are in-
evitable when that unfolding takes place, as it
threatens to do, in a hot-bed of selﬁshness and all
evil passions. Man’s mental and psychic growth
will proceed in harmony with his moral improve-
ment, while his material surroundings will reﬂect
the peace and fraternal good-will which will reign
in his mind, instead of the discord and strife which
is everywhere apparent around us to-day.

The Society has neither creeds nor dogmas, but,
teaching a sublime archaic philosophy of the Uni-
verse, it recognises through its Fellows the need
of remaining utterly faithful to the spiritual im-
pulses which brought about its founding.
From each Fellow it requires the same kindly and
thoughtful consideration for the belief of others
which he expects others to show towards his own.
The Objects of the Theosophical Society are:
(1) To diffuse among men a knowledge of the
laws inherent in the Universe.
(2) To promulgate the knowledge of the essen-
tial unity of all that is and to demonstrate that this
unity is fundamental in Nature.
(3) To form an active Brotherhood among men.
(4) To study ancient and modern religion, sci-
ence, and philosophy.
(5) To investigate the powers innate in man.
THE THEoSoFHIcAL Soc1ETv welcomes to fellow-
