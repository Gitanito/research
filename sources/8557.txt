Sample    There is   no specified sample in this article.&nbsp; It seeks to compare literature, medical   explanation, and Biblical explanation of the near-death experience phenomenon.

  Abstract

Exploration of the   near-death phenomena is presented as an event that needs further study.&nbsp; Medical   explanations are presented along with explanations that believers in near-death   phenomena have explained.&nbsp; Specific drugs and their effect are presented as they   all have different effects sighted by people who have had near-death   experiences.&nbsp; Medical professionals see the drugs as the cause of these   effects.&nbsp; Near-death experiencers see the event of near-death as the cause of   the experience and not the drugs.&nbsp; Also presented by medical professionals as a   source of the near-death experience are various maladies that might mimic the   near-death experience reported by experiencers.&nbsp; These are also refuted by those   that have studied the near-death phenomena and have accepted them as a glimpse   into the afterlife.&nbsp; A section about memories of birth, as reported by Carl   Sagan, is also presented as an explanation for near-death experiences and again   is refuted by those that believe the near death experience is much more.&nbsp;   Finally, the article concludes that the near-death reports can only be accepted   as much as they agree with the Bible.&nbsp; Anything experienced that is deviant or   refutes what the Bible has to say is deemed as unacceptable.&nbsp; What goes along   with Biblical principles is acceptable for people to consider and all near-death   experiences must be scrutinized for the acceptableness under the guidelines set   by this article.

Important Concepts   and Definitions    Biblical   principles ' the guidelines available in the Bible for living one's life and   pleasing God.

  Operationalizations    As this is   more of a review of the literature available and how to interpret the near-death   phenomena, there is no operationalization of variables available in this   article.

  Major Findings&nbsp;     In respect   to the family and how they deal with near-death experiences, two opposing   viewpoints are presented.&nbsp; One says that near-death experience has a positive   impact on families.&nbsp; Another says the converse of this.&nbsp; The things sighted in   the article as positive outcomes of near-death experiences were, 'they become   more loving; the become seekers of truth; they value life itself more highly;   they lose their fear of death (p. 20).'&nbsp; In regard to the family, we have seen   that becoming more loving is not necessarily a positive outcome for the family.&nbsp;   In fact, this characteristic often drives the family to question the loyalty and   motives of the near-death experiencer.&nbsp; On the negative side, P.M.H Atwater is   sighted as providing the negative outcomes of near-death experiencers.&nbsp; They   sight her as contributing that people often find it hard to commit to   relationships and careers after having a near-death experience.&nbsp; She is quoted   as saying, 'thus, many people experience family problems, divorce, and the   inability to hold a job (p. 20).'&nbsp; This then rounds out the information in   respect to families according to this article.
