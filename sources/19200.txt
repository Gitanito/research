my name is doing Arneson born in
Rochester Minnesota back in 1937 went to
Rochester high school from there I I
graduated went on to Sonoma College in
Northfield Minnesota where I got my
degree in physics and math upon
graduation I competed in Officer
Training School the Air Force and was
selected to get a commission when two
officers training school and was
commissioned back in 1962 I went on to
spend 26 years in the US Air Force as a
communication electronics officer and
retired in 1986
I had assignments all over the world
including Vietnam Europe
you name a lot probably been there I
held a top-secret SC I TK Clarence that
means a special compartment &#39;add tangled
kilo information which is above
top-secret if you will it takes a
special investigation to get that sort
of a clearance upon graduation upon
getting out of the Air Force retiring as
a colonel in the 1986 there&#39;s a director
of logistics at wright-patterson Air
Force Base I applied for work at Boeing
and I came in to work for Boeing as a
computer systems analyst and I&#39;ve been
working since 1987 in that capacity
with Boeing I have had various
opportunities to see things that come
through my perusal for one instance back
in 1962 I was lieutenant at Ramstein Air
Force Base in Germany excuse me I was a
crypto officer for the entire Ramstein
Air Base I was a top-secret control
officer and in that capacity I happen to
see a classified message you go through
my comm center which said that a UFO has
crashed on the island of Spitsbergen
Norway and a team of scientists are
coming to investigate it I do not recall
what the message came from where I was
going to because in that capacity we
were oftentimes told what you see here
leave here but I can recall seeing that
the next thing that comes to mind is one
that took place in 1967 I was in charge
at the communications center a 28-year
division at Malmstrom Air Force Base
Montana I was again the top-secret
control officer there i dispatched all
the nuclear launch authenticator to the
sac missile crews and what not so I had
a very good top-secret background to you
know to go on one night or one day I
should say I happen to see a message
that came through my communication
center there again I cannot quote the
date where it came from where it was
going to but I do recall reading it and
say and say basically that a UFO was
seen near missile subtle numbers I can&#39;t
recall
but it was hovering there and it said
that the crew go in on duty and the crew
coming off duty all saw the UFO just
hovering in mid area it was a metallic
circular object and from what I
understand the missiles were all shut
down since that time a couple years ago
a friend of mine Bob Kaminski manager at
Boeing who has since passed away by fact
he passed away last year on the art bill
show one night a guy by the name of Bob
solace called in and he was talking
about this incident and I said
interesting he was talking about these
missiles being shut down and then later
on that night Bob Kaminski who had
retired from Boeing he called him there
bill show and he said yes I was the
manager I was the engineer assigned by
Boeing to come up and check out the
missiles to make certain that they in
fact had not gone down upon their own
and he said I gave him a complete bill
of health and I worked for Bob in Boeing
and I was a good friend of his even
before he passed away we had many many
conversations on the subject and he was
just a very incredible man and what I
mean by missiles going down they were
not in at launch they were in the
missile silos and they were being I
don&#39;t know what sac does as far as
activated and missile is concerned but
it&#39;s basically on a standby mode so it
can be launched but when they say it
went down it means that went dead and
something turned those missiles off and
so they could not be put in a mode of
launching when I was a commander of a
radar squadron up in Maine a canceled
Air Force Station main we were right
next door to Lauren Air Force Base was
where that launched the b-52s and the
Casey tankers and things like that yeah
I had a lot of security friends over
there Lauren who told me about and I
have no first-hand knowledge of it but
they also had seen UFOs hovering near
the nuclear weapon storage area I&#39;m
Lauren air force base 62 63 timeframe
yes but it definitely said being a
Norwegian ancestor I knew about the item
that spits
Bergen Norway in fact my ancestors I
haven&#39;t done a lot of research are from
that particular neck of the woods you
kind of keep my interest when I saw that
name I asked around and the powers that
be if they knew about it which I&#39;m sure
they probably read the message they were
told not to to say anything you did it
just wasn&#39;t talked about you know if you
talked about that kind of stuff they
would kind of look askance at you and
say and what&#39;s with this guy
but you saw there you left there and it
was kind of politically incorrect to do
that kind of thing
to talk about it as you well know a
little bit of background not to belabor
the point but yeah when I was assigned
as director of logistics at
wright-patterson I left the wife and
kids back in Oklahoma City because my
daughter is last year of high school so
I went out there on my own for about a
year and in the house in the search for
an apartment out there I came across
this lady Chris Whedon by name who had a
little five acre English kind of Manor
up outside of Dayton and she had
peacocks until she had three rooms for
rent three bedrooms so I rented one and
I kind of became her son I helped her
cut the grass i mold the lawn you know
and I cut the wood she was up in her 70s
a little background of that though her
husband a lieutenant colonel Spence
Whedon was I say he died this was back
in 86 timeframe now he died about 12
years prior to that and from everybody
that I met they said he was just a
brilliant guy he had a photographic mind
and he was one of the lead investigators
of UFO stuff at wright-patterson in fact
I have a tape at home produced back in
the 1950s at the debate between Spencer
Whedon and that major Keyhoe Donald keel
they were actually in a debate if you
will found that it was done the
Armstrong Circle theatre but anyhow he
was her husband if you will
the one person I happened to meet it
took quite a shine to and and he to me
was a doctor Adolph Rome now he at that
time was 83 years old I think he has
since died one night after after supper
and after a few martinis I joke in the
ass Adolph I said what do you know about
the little great men that are supposedly
on ice here at wright-patterson and I
can distinctly recall his face turning
ashen white his voice got very stern and
he said Arnie he says all I can tell you
is that they were not weather balloons
and we will not talk about it again you
understand and there was no uncertainty
in my mind that we wouldn&#39;t talk about
this further he also just a little
background on him he was from
Switzerland originally he was on there
first a bomb test in the u.s. he knew
dr. Oppenheimer personally and just a
fine fine gentleman but I&#39;ve just
something that kind of relates to the
Roswell thing for what it may be worth
even though I had a top-secret clearance
there were areas that we just couldn&#39;t
get near and we just could not find
anything about some of these areas of
Rai Patterson that may have held some
bodies or who knows what the hill and a
lot of my my technicians that work for
me and as a communication electronics
officer they would tell stories about
things going across the radar screens at
fantastic speeds you know they and they
were not I think could go that fast well
this was this was back in the in the mid
70s and then I had that radar a squadron
commanders job and and castled Air Force
Station main that&#39;s when they these type
nations would tell me about things like
there so the commander of a radar
squadron you have people who are
operational types as you well as the
people who are the technician types who
actually maintain the radars in fact in
the capacity we would take and have
battle exercises we were the only radar
squadron in the u.s. under operational
control of the Canadian or a division up
North Bay Canada now as I say we had the
we were oftentimes you&#39;d see in the
rigor of scope should see that b-52s
coming down from Canada the fighter
interceptors being directed against him
or not so these men the operational
types knew how fast things were flying
they knew how the speed of bombers any
of the speed of the current fighter
force that we had the radar technicians
I had the maintenance men working for me
they were in a position to say yes a
scope was an a.1 condition or the radar
is in a one condition so things could
check out the experience of the
operational types the experience of the
maintenance guys they confirmed that the
system was operating perfectly and they
told stories I didn&#39;t see the actual
tracks myself go across the radar
screens but they said that thing is
going to or three thousand miles an hour
in England I heard it from different
stories and different sources that read
rated the similar events at different
radar stations throughout the u.s. not
just it wasn&#39;t just that that Castle Air
Force Station that had happened but some
guys were stationed in California and we
had radar stations back in those days
all over the u.s. since that time we had
been deactivated and returned back over
to faa control so but stories like that
not uncommon at all I think back in
those days the possibility of such a
thing being released of the people would
probably have caused a lot of social
unrest
because it has religious implications if
you will it&#39;s about social implications
you know but to think about it all this
vast universe we have if were the only
intelligent life here
God has sure got bad judgment first
thing I did was look at the guards eyes
and tell me the truth about this this
object
he swore up and down he was telling the
truth I believed you know for a couple
of reasons I I knew he was frightened
when he called me down there
yeah he told me about situation I
certainly believed
