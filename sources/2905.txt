Manifesto Seven

QJatrtqn JFlrrlia.
For many years, the Hierophant of
the "Western Tradi ti ons ,1
1 and that Body
associated with Him, have labored to
teach and serve, in the University of
the Mystic Brotherhood. During these
years, they have labored and worked be­
hind the Veil of Obscurity, seeking nei­
ther reward nor honor, content with giv­
ing the "Messages of Truth" to those who
have come seeking.The unexampled growth
of the University has come almost entire­
ly thru the recommendations of satisfied
students who have sensed the innate Spi­
rituality of the given Messages, and who
have contacted the love which actuates
all who serve thru this Institution.
Gratified members have carried the Mes­
sage and so the work of the Institution
has grown far beyond expectations, and
it is now among the larger in the world
of the truly altruistic, non-commercial
Institutions. .
So successfully has the work been
done, so successfully has the entire
aim and pursuit been kept intent on ser­
vice, and so completely has the worldly
lure of self-aggrandizement, honor, and
reward been resisted,thet now there has
been authorized a most Epochal Pronunci-
amento, which is now given forth.
Under the Jurisdiction of this Hierophant of
the Body of the Mystic Brotherhood University, there is
to again come into Being, in this Western World, and at
the beginning of this Western Age, the old time-honored
Church of the Illuminati. Documents and Froofs submit­
ted to the Government of the United States, have been ac­
cepted and the sole right to the Ancient Symbol and Name
of the Church of the Illuminati has been vested in us-
The purpose of the work of the Church of the
Illuminati is two-fold. The Western Traditions, which
give to the people the Religion of the Illuminati, at
this time, fill a great need. Never has there been a pe­
riod when the cry for Light, and Understanding has risen
in greater volume, and the appeals are increasing daily,
as countless thousands realize that this i s no mere de­
pression, but the birth of a new social system and they
realize further, that the change from the old to the new
is fraught with danger and grave consequences. They need
help,assistance and knowledge. It will be the purpose of
the Churches of the Illuminati to furnish this to them.
This requires sincere men and women.ably qua­
lified, trained, and taught in the Work of the Western
Traditions, and such will be given an opportunity to aid
Humanity and the Western Masters and to support themsel­
ves comfortably while doing so. We now open to those, a
Profession, and a Service,in the line of work which they
most enjoy. It will provide an opportunity for a Service
of Love and the opening of channels of Supply by which
all that is required and necessary to provide for needs
should come to them. The "Mother Church" of the Illumi­
nati will accept Lay-Members for such training (by mail)
and will furnish assistance in the work of its regular
members who shall be the Ordained Ministers of its Branch
Churches thruout the World.
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE
1 - Any man or woman of good moral character
who is a student and member of the Mystic Brotherhood U­
niversity, taking the regular courses of Instruction.
REQUIREMENTS CF MEMBERSHIP
2 - The requirements of Lay-Membership in the
Mother Church of the Illuminati, are that the applicant
be a member in good standing of the regular work of the
Mystic Brotherhood University, and that he shall conform
to d efini te standard s in hi s studi e s , that he or ahe
shall be over twenty-one years of age, and that the Lay-
Merabers of the Church must indicate their worthiness for
final Ordination by the general manner in which they han­
dle their studies in the University, and their obliga­
tions, and follow the general rules, and requirements.
STUDIES REQUIRED
3 - It shall be the purpose of the "Mother"
Church of the Illuminati to train and ordain Ministers,
Teachers,Practitioners,and the Council shall decide the
Curriculum necessary for the training of those who aspire
to be such Ministers, Teachers, or Practitioners of the
Church, with an authority, which will enable them after
graduation,to comply with the Laws of any City and State
governing Ordained Ministers,of National Religious Move­
ments .thereby enabling them to incorporate branch Church­
es, and as the Minister and Spiritual Leader of those
Churches, to teach the Religion of the Illuminati, to
have private or public classes,and to open their own of­
fices as Practitioners, offering and giving to Humanity,
relief and assistance in all sickness and disease,wheth-
er such affliction be "Spiritual, Mental or Physical."
Also,to enable such Practitioners to aid in creating new
Spiritual, Mental, Moral, Physical or Social Conditions
for his or her clients.
4 - For the present, the studies required,
shall be the regular work of the Mystic Brotherhood Uni­
versity, in the regular department.The Lay-Members of the
Church must retain his membership in the University, and
he must conform to definite Standards of study and-work.
He must prove his interest and zeal, as well as his wor­
thiness, to act as Teacher, Practitioner and Ordained
Minister of the Church of the Illuminati. The entire
work of the Brotherhood, which the Applicant must com­
plete, covers a period of four years or four semesters,
if the work is taken at the regular rate of one lesson
per week.Those who are able to take two lessons per week
thereby cut the time in half -
5 - Each six months, Certificates of Credit
will be issued, to those who have completed the work of
the half semester.These credit cards, will apply on the
requirements of the Lay-Memberships in the Church of the
Illuminati.If it is necessary to go on the inactive list
of the University work for a time, such credits may be
preserved, and when the work is again taken up, the ap­
plicant may commence from that point.There will be short
semi-annual "written examinations" tegting the general
knowledge and understanding of the student, in the work
covered in the preceding half semester.
6 - When the applicant has completed the pres­
cribed course and has accumulated the required number of
credits, he shall be entitled to take the Final Examina­
tion, the answers to which shall he written and returned
to his Teacher, together with his Ordination Offering,
which he makes to the Church,in appreciation of the work
which has been done with him and for him. If he success­
fully completes the requirements of the examination, he
shall then be ordained a Minister of the Church of the
Illuminati, certified to by proper Certificates, and he
is then qualified, if invited, to act as Pastor of any
Church of the Illuminati,in any part of the United States
or to teach classes, public or private, and to open his
own office as a Practitioner of the Mother Church of the
Illuminati.
7 - In this connectlon,it must be understood
that while the work of the Mystic Brotherhood University
is under the voluntary offering plan, and that while the
Services of the Mystic Brotherhood University, and its
Teachers, are without fixed price, to all sincere appli­
cants for knowledge,the special fund of the Brotherhood
available for paying the expenses of such students as
are not able to pay their own expenses 19 limited, and
practically exhausted,be cause of the conditions,and the
vast number of students who are new being carried by the
Brotherhood who do not cover their own actual expenses.
Postage stamps, envelopes, paper, and printing require
cash and an even larger item is the typing of personal
individual letters.Someone must pay these items for each
9tudent. This being the case it must be understood that
the Church of the Illuminati, while an organization, not
for profit, and not commercial, must be self-supporting
absolutely. Applicants for Lay-Membership in the Mother
Church desirous of obtaining their Degree and of being
ordained as Ministers of the Church, must be in a posi­
tion to cover all the very small expenses of the regular
work of the University, and in addition, pay the fees
necessary to cover the expenses of the Credit Certifi­
cates ,Examination details, Records and Clerical details
of the Church.The recognized voluntary offerings in the
Mystic Brotherhood University.Regular Department are be­
tween one and two dollars per month or more,and the ex­
pense of preparing the Credi ts, preparing examinations,
stationery, and all other detailed items of the Church
will reach at least a dollar a month per Lay-Member, it
is therefore proposed as follows:
f
l - The applicant for Lay-Membership in the
Mother Church of the Illuminati ,shall first of al1, De a
student of the Regular Department of the Mystic Brother­
hood University, and shall so maintain his membership in
good standing. If his offering to the Mystic Brotherhood
University is one dollar per month, he shall be entitled
to one lesson per week, and credits will be duly issued
as the work is comple ted each half semester- If his of­
ferings to the Brotherhood University are one dollar and
a half per month, he shall have six lessons per month,
receiving extra credits, thus shortening the necessary
total time requirements- If his offering is as much as
two dollars per month, he shall receive two lessons per
week, with double credits,cutting the four year require-
raenta in half. In add iti on to thi s , he shal1 pay a fee
of one dollar per month, to maintain his Lay-Membership
in the Church of the Illuminati- Under this plan, the
member need pay little more than he should be sending at
the present time, in the regular department in the Bro­
therhood .
9 - Those who propose to become Teachers and
Practitioners of the Church of the Illuminati, are ex­
pected to cooperate with and aid both the Church and the
University,by conforming with the rules and regulations
thu9 avoiding adding unnecessarily to the expenses of
the University or the Church.This can be done by prompt
payment of the necessary offerings, prompt notificatican
of changes in address, and a general interest, enthusi­
asm and zeal. These are to be expected from all who as­
pire to be Teachers of Humanity, recognized by the Cos­
mic Hierarchies, as such.
METHOD OF APPLYING
10 - The Method of applying for Lay-Membership
in the Church of the Illuminati to become a Teacher,
Practitioner or Minister, is first that one shall join
and become an accepted member oi the Mystic Brotherhood
University, in the Regular Department,then the enclosed
application may be filled in, signed, end returned to
the Secretary of the Church of the Illuminati, with the
enrollment fee of two dollars to cover the necessary
clerical expenses of the enrolling of the applicant. If
the applicant is not accepted by the "Church Council,"
this offering will be returned. If,at any time in the fu­
ture, the applicant is placed upon the inactive list,thru
failure to comply with the regulations of the Church of
of the Mystic Brotherhood University,or for other reasons
they ahal1,before reinstatement,fill in a re-instatement
application for Lay-Membership in the Church,sending one
half of the regular enrollment fee, that is, one dollar,
to cover the cost of transferring the names and records
to an inactive and then back to an active list again, ^f
course, a reinstatement shall first be made in the files
and records of the Mystic Brotherhood University before
the Church Application for reinstatement can be accepted.
11 - Present members of the Mystic Brotherhood
University desirous of taking up this new work may apply
per paragraph 10 and credit will be issued by his Teach­
er for such work as has been satisfactorily completed.
Welfare members may change to the Regular Department by
conforming with its requirements and will receive credit
for the work already done.
12 - Members of the University, who have been
students for a considerable length of time, and have com­
pleted such work as may be required a priori to being or­
dained, as a Minister of the Church, may fill in their
application, if they are interested, and send it in now
with the understanding, that on account of the amount of
detail which is to be yet worked out, it will be three
to six months before the final examination can be given,
and their Ordination can take place. They are requested
to indicate their desire, however, by sending applica­
tion at this time and assuming regular Lay-Membership in
the Church.
13 - With further regard to the matter of the
Ordination Offering. Each about to graduate from the Mo­
ther Chv.rch of the Illuminati, as Teacher, Practitioner,
or Orda.ned Minister, shall make such a voluntary gift
to the Church, sending it with his final examination pa­
pers. The Church is dependent upon the offerings of its
members, the monthly fee is very low,far less than othnr
Institutions and the Ordination Gifts alone enable the
work to go on.There is surely no better way in which bhe
love and appreciation of those who are about to be grad­
uated, as Ordained Ministers can be shown than by such
Offering at that time. The necessary Church Manuals
containing the Order of Church Services, the Rituals., In­
structions for the Pastors, the Marriage, Funeral and
Baptism Ceremonies, and all of the other details, which
the duly Ordained Minister will need, are included. The
Practitioner will have a Manual for instructio n ,and guid­
ance, in the opening of their offices, and the handling
of their clients -
- while the Teacher receives similar
instructions in the forming of their classes - topics to
be discussed,the methods and manner of creating and hold­
ing interest.
14 - Those who at final examinations make the
minimum gift of twenty five dollars receive the necessary
Manuals, and Instructions, together with a beautifully en­
graved Certificate,attesting their Ordination. Those who
desire the necessary robe of their Grade as Ordained Min­
ister will be furnished such Robe and Stole, provided
the expense is covered in the offering, which in that e­
v e n t , must be at least fifty dollars. The Robe wi11 be
made to measure, of beautiful silk, with Stole of White
Satin, embroidered with the Symbols and Insignia of the
Order in Gold Thread. The colors of the Robe, may be
White or Light Violet.
15 - After graduation, Teachers, Practitioners,
and Ordained Ministers, shall all retain their membership
in the Mother Church becoming full members and receiving
thru monthly bulletins, instructions in carrying out the
assigned tasks, and the personal questions and problems
will be dealt with in the correspondence and advice and
instruction will be given. - At the time of the gradua­
tion, they will be instructed in the proper procedure in
organizing a Branch Church in their Community, and in form
ing classes or opening offices, without the payment of the
excessively high licenses which are reauired in many com-
muni ties.
16 - The one who contemplates studying and de­
veloping with an idea of entering upon the Path of Ser­
vice, as a Life Profession is naturally interested in
many phases of the work. In almost every case, the mat­
ter of finances stands first in his mind. He should know
of course, that if he does dedicate his life to the Ser­
vice of the Master, sufficient will be provided for his
reasonable needs, if he does his part.Perhaps, it is fit­
ting In the closing pages of this presentation of a new
opportunity, that we should discuss this matter in de­
tail .
17 - After all, the right or wrong of the mat­
ter of accepting money for Occult and Spiritual Service
lies in the mental attitude of the Minister. Teacher or
Fractitioner;certainly he or she who ia devoting their en­
tire time to work of this kind, is entitled to a remuner­
ation,suff ici ent to take care of themselves, in comforta­
ble circumstances, and certainly no Minister, Teacher or
Practitioner can do their best, nor can the work receive
the respect to which it is entitled, unless they are suf­
ficiently endowed with income to maintain their proper
station in life, and b 2 free from the worry and care of
Obligations. The Offerings of the Church of which the Min­
ister will be the Spiritual H ead,are of course, volun­
tary, as they usually are in any Church. All that a Min­
ister has of Spiritual Understanding or Power, he gives
freely to his congregation, that all who are thirsty may
come and drink freely of the Waters of Life.
18 - But, those who wish additional services,
who are ill or have special problems, which require the
time and attention of the Minister in his office, should
be willing to reimburse him in accordance with, the ser­
vices rendered. The Minister may or may not, beable to
receive a salary for his work in the Church, but in his
work as a Practitioner, he is entitled to remuneration
from each of hie clients according to their ability.Here
again, his mental attitude defines the line of demarca­
tion between right and wrong. If his principal motive is
service, and if he has a sincere regard for the problems
of those who come to him, then he is maintaining the high
standard of Occultism and Mysticism.
19 - There is another field in which the Or­
dained Minister of the Church of the Illuminati fills
out his income. - It is this: he is authorized by the Mo­
ther Church of the Illuminati, to accept not more than
thirty pupils in any Calendar Year, for the purpose of
teaching them to become Practitioners, for the Branch
Church of which he is a Pastor. - Their Certificates
should be issued by the Pastor, and sent to the Mother
Church for it9 counter Signature, so that the Practition­
ers may be recognized Nationally. Members of these class­
es are to pay a fee to their Teacher (the Church Minister)
of from two to five dollars per month,who as the Minister
may decide. Inasmuch as the work will cover two years,
the Minister may have, after the first year, two classes
per year, of thirty pupils each, if he desires,a new class
commencing at the beginning, and a higher class, which
will be approximately half way thru. This will give him
then, the authority to teach, and train sixty pupils at
a time, and the income is recognized as his right and
due for the service he renders in fitting those who de-
9ire to become Practitioners, to themselves in turn work
with and for Humanity, No one, save Ordained Ministers
of the Mother Church of the Illuminati, will have 9uch
right to train Practitioners.
19a - Such Ministers also shall have the sole
right to use the Ancient Symbol Mark of the Illuminati
in accordance with the privileges of sole use vested in
the Mother Church by the Government of the United States.
20 - The newly Ordained Minister, when ready
then incorporates his branch Church under the Laws of
his State, and commences his services, 9imple at first,
but increasing in detailB as he carefully selects assis­
tants, singers, etc., from those who attend.
21 - As the congregation grows, he announces
his office hours as Practitioner and Spiritual Advisor.
A little later he can announce the formation of a first
class for the training of Special Practitioners for the
new Church, and the following year, a second class.
22 - By the time the first class graduates,at
the end of the two year period,the congregation and work
to be done should he far beyond the capacity of the Min­
ister, and the Church will need as many as may remain
out of the original class, so they should be able to op­
en their offices and find abundant work.
23 - Of course, much depends upon the capabi­
lity, the initiative,judgment and personality of the Min­
ister, insofar a9 he is flexible and actuated by a sin­
cere regard for his fellows, he will find that the Chan­
nels of Supply, thru the offerings of the Church, thru
hia private practice as a Practitioner of the Church,
and thru his authorized clas9e9, will be sufficient to
maintain him in such station of life aa will accord him
the respect of his fellow men.
24 - In hia elementary training, before Ordin­
ation, and after hia Ordination as a Minister of the Mo­
ther Church, in the forming of his classes, and the work
which he will need to give help, in the many problems
which will arise in his personal practice, the Minister
is going to need help and guidance. He is going to need
personal letters, dealing with individual points, he is
going to need Rituals, Services, Lectures, and Letters.
Hia needs will be almost unlimited, and it is thru the
retaining of his membership in the Mother Church, that
provision will be made to supply him with these things.
This will be covered as nearly on a non-profit basis,as
is possible, by his small Lay-Llembership fee and later
by his full Membership fee.
NOT OBLIGATORY
25 - It is NOT obligatory that such Lay-Member
immediately upon Ordination shall commence his work. This
may be deferred until later, after other duties and af­
fairs are out of the way. He should, however, prepare now
and thus have his authority when the way opens.
THE OPPORTUNITY
26 - The Inauguration of the Church of the Il­
luminati should now afford to each one an unusual oppor­
tunity. Those who are, or who can take the full regular
work have now a Goal towards which to work, a profession
that will enable them to secure Peace, and Happiness in
Life which they cannot find in ordinary commercial work
with its stress and strain, its terrific competition and
its inharmony with fine Spiritual Natures.
WELFARE PUPILS
27 - Those who are unable at present to take
the full regular work may proceed with the Welfare Work,
demonstrating by their zeal and enthusiasm, as well as
in the general manner in which they handle their corres­
pondence and comply with the rules, that they are worthy.
The Teacher will note these things and form his opinion
so that when the time comes, when formal application can
be made, the credits allowed will be such that time will
not be lost.
COOPERATION
28 - Each therefore can now work with added en­
thusiasm, making what sacrifices are needed that due stud­
y and development may proceed without distraction, gain­
ing strength thru the discipline of keeping each study pe­
riod, writing the regular letters as and when due, and
demonstrating in the matter of covering their expenses an
appreciation of others problems, showing in all things
that they can learn and understand the fundamentals of life
right living and right growth, and that they have that sym­
pathetic understanding of others, which made the Western
Master outstanding.
a p p l i c a t i o n FOR l a y -m e m b f r s h i p
IN
THE CHURCH OF THE ILLUMINATI
I _____________________________________respectfully
make plea to the Bishop and Council of the Mother Church
of the Illuminati for Lay-Membership in the said Church.
I understand that such Lay-Membership is a Probationary-
Membership to continue as such until I have finished the
prescribed studies,passed my examinations and received my
Ordination as a Minister ,Teacher and Practitioner of the
Church, at which time I shall apply for Full-Membership.
It is my desire and intention to live ag nearly
as possible in accordance with the general principles of
the Illuminati as taught by the Mystic Brotherhood Univer­
sity and exemplified by the Master Jesus,as I myself in­
terpret such teaching and such example.
I agree to apply myself to my studies to the
best of my abilities and as far as I am able, to continue
thru all the grades of the University until I receive my
Ordination as a Minister of the Church, and so far as T
may be able I intend to work at some time either thru a
branch of the said Church, or as a Class Teacher, or as a
Practitioner, but I understand my present obligations and
duties are to be carried but so long as they remain my du­
ties and my obligations.
I agree to maintain my membership in the Mystic
Brotherhood in good standing and to regularly and prompt­
ly send my offerings to the said University and I further
agree to maintain my membership as a Lay-Member in said
Church, by thoughtful consideration, by application and
zeal and to promptly and regularly make my offering to the
Church for the expenses incurred in my behalf. I under­
stand that if I am placed on the inactive list of the Un­
iversity, it will automatically place me upon the inactive
files of the Church.
I agree not to reveal the contents of such priv­
ate manuscripts as may be given or loaned to me as T ad­
vance to higher work in the Church of the Illuminati,nor
shall I allow such private papers to fall into other hands.

Respected Member,
Greetings
Complying with the request which you have sent to your Teach­
er,I am very happy to enclose herewith Manifesto Seven,which outlines the work
of the Mother Church of the Illuminati as a training School for Ministers,
Practitioners and Teachers.
I am sure you will read it carefully and will note with inter­
est that it is now possible for you,thru application and zeal to receive credits
in the work you have been and are taking, which will be applied if and when you
become a Lay Member in the Church.
Upon formal application for Lay Membership and acceptance as
such, you will receive monthly, in addition to your regular work from your
Teacher, Special, Private Instructions and Exercises in condensed form, fitting
you to attain and receive the descent of the Holy Spirit that Power may be yours
in Healing, Speaking and Teaching. Each Minister will thus be a true Priest of
Power, each Practitioner healing in "the Name of God", and each Teacher vital
with Spiritual Grace. These Special Instructions will be sent only so long as
they are used and practiced with real application, and with altruistic motives.
Only so long also as the Supplicant keeps them Private, and maintains the rules
and obligations of his association both with Church and the University, written
and applied.
To those who have been so understanding of Universal Brother­
hood as to send the University additional amounts above the regular expenses to
be used in and for its Welfare Department, I wish it understood that Church Mem­
bership will NOT require additional amounts--in other words those who send extra
sums need not increase those amounts, but simply ask for Lay Membership and the
Scribe will distribute the sums sent, between the Church, the University and the
balance to the Welfare Department. We want such as these faithful ones to feel
that all we have to give is theirs.
For the present address all communications,including your for­
mal application which is on the last page in the booklet, Manifesto Seven,direct
to your regular Teacher, so that it may be expedited.
In His Name,
B ish o p

Beloved Brother:
Your letter of the 9th has been brought into my
study and indeed it does mark the entering of a brighter year, with many
opportunities for spiritual advancement.
I can understand your feelings as you consider con­
ditions about you and I would like to discuss these things for it is
well to have a correct understanding of them.
I do want you to get the picture however, as clear­
ly as possible, for the situation is fraught with many difficulties, and
the storm-clouds hang low on the horizon. In Italy the philosophers of
fascimo have in terms reasserted the old Roman doctrine, that the citi­
zen exists for the State, and every act of the Duce is consistent with
that Doctrine, though he has not as yet pushed it to its ultimate..
Germany, so it seems, is following Italy in this,
it is impossible otherwise to understand either acts or words of Hitler,
and his Ministers; leaving Soviety Russia out of the question, it is om­
inous, or should be for us Americans, that two of the great Powers of
Europe should set up systems of Government that so completely oppose what
seems to us to be the self-evident foundationsof all Governments amongst
men. Is there something loose in the world that threatens those foun­
dations?
Ten or more years ago LaPalingenesi di Roma, warned
the world that the Moloch State was being reborn, the State that claimed
the citizens body and soul for itself, and admitted no limitations, hum­
or or design upon its Powers. We, the youngest of the great Nations, foun­
ded our Nation upon a flat denial of that claim. The assertion of human
rights against the State, contained in the opening sentences of the Dec­
laration of Independence, has been declared by our Supreme Court to be
the Soul of the Constitution.
We find ourselves now in an emergency which
us to re-orient our economic life in such a manner as to bring the
government into direct relation with ur lives to an extent, and in a
degree without precedent in our short history. It is common talk amon
us that the Constitution is in form some rough treatment as the New
Deal develops. In part a jest pe haps, for it is our habit to jest
serious things, at least for a while.
Are 7/e, too, beginning to slip from our moorings?
Perhaps not, but as one nears the ole World, and begins to breathe the
troubled air, and note the lowering clouds, that cover the sky of
affairs, one cannot help wondering whether our own foundations are
still solidly standing where they did. We are very young yet. As we
grow up, shall we escape Moloch? That seems to me, is about the most
important single question for our attention.
I think that nothing perhaps would make us rea­
lize just how young America is, as will time devoted to a little research
into History. So many are accustomed to think that civilization is ex­
tending back but a short five or six thousand years, seeing in their Mind's
eye, half naked savages running over the sands and suddenly acquiring the
habit of using the cooperand bronze, and becoming civilized. They fail
to realize the vast periods of millions of years in which man has inhab­
ited the Earth.
Men who build pyramids whose roof stones stay in
place by a mysterious power that baffles twentieth century engineers,
do not clothe themselves in skins for a time, live in caves, and learn
the use of fire, and we judge them the cities of antiquity, and their
accoutrements, that we are justified in believing that the world com­
merce of these Phoenicians must have b en quite on a par in volume and
value with anything displayed by England and the United States at the
present time.
And even after all this, these mighty civilizations
are still young in time, back of thesePhoenicians, a hundred and fifty
thousand years or more, there reigned the twelve Kings of Atlantis, the
mother land, which from the great Sun Temple on the Heights of the Hill
in the Center, ruled the entire world, and then another hundred thousand
years or more and we come to Lemuria - still finding men civilized, ed­
ucated, in all arts and sciences, setting out as explorers in their crafts
across the Pacific, landing in Mexico, and western United States, we
find them building a great canal through the Isthmus, and sending their
huge ships equal in size to any of ours of today, out into the broad At­
lantic. And so on and on, back and back, to the time when the great Water
Rings hid the surface of the Earth from the Sun's Rays, those days when
there were giants that lived practically alone in a true Garden of Eden.
As we glance back over this array of great civiliza­
tions that have come and gone, as we survey the catastrophy which sank
Atlantis beneath the Waves, and wiped out the Adite Kingdom, as the great
flaming meteor from Heaven fell upon the Earth, burying the Earth's Sur­
face some seven hundred feet beneath the debris. As we study all these
things, we realize indeed, how young we are - this civlization of the
Anglo-Saxons, England and America, andparti cularly America, which is
now going through the first throes of difficulty with its Constitution ,
and it is no wonder the question arises whether we have indeed slipped
our mooring.
I find I have talked at quite some length, following
out the trend of thought, so I will be unable to comment upon the other
interesting points in yourletter. I have enjoyed going over them however
and we noted the correction in the address and in the future your com­
munications will be sent to 2054 Garnit Street. We appreciate your call­
ing our attention to this.
The Brotherhood acknowledges receipt of theScribe
Alms and extend their sincere thanks, appreciation and blessings.
Sincerely, Thy Brother in Light Eternal,
