 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Transactions of the Blavatsky Lodge</I>

 This is a serial rather than a journal and consists of transcriptions of the shorthand notes written by her students of H.P. Blavatskyâ€™s discussions in the Blavatsky Lodge from January 10 to June 20, 1889.   They sorely need to be re-done.
