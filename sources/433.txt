 This was a Theosophical journal edited by B.P. Wadia (1881-1958) who had resigned from the Adyar Theosophical Society in 1922 and adhered to the United Lodge of Theosophists because of his desire to re-focus Theosophy more on the original teachings of H.P. Blavatsky.  He sought in this journal to incorporate a broader discussion of the traditional wisdom of Hinduism and Buddhism as it related to Theosophy and included extensive reviews of contemporary scholarship on philosophy, mysticism, and religion.  Contributions by A.E. Waite, Algernon Blackwood, and others, and regular articles by John Middleton Murry (the editor of the Athenaeum),  C.E.M. Joad, and others.   University of Texas, Austin.
