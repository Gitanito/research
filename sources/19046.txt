hello everyone this dr. Ben Greer it&#39;s a
little after 9:00 sorry we&#39;re late we
had a internet computer in combat
incompatibility problem but we got so
I&#39;d like to thank everyone for joining
us today and it&#39;s a show that I really
want to focus on we&#39;ll do several it&#39;s
just on the science of consciousness a
lot of people say what do you mean by
that
and it&#39;s really about standing how the
mind and consciousness operates outside
the confines of your your physical
immediate environment and so that&#39;s
really what&#39;s exciting and before I get
into it I want to thank everyone who&#39;s
helped make cop Close Encounters of the
fifth kind a possibility as you know
we&#39;ve been number one on iTunes and
thanks to justice Campbell who is a jet
commercial airline pilot who did the
crowdfunding campaign we&#39;ve been able to
make that a reality and the whole team
of Michael Missoula and the production
team
everyone&#39;s joined in making this a
reality and to the 4,100 or so people
who contributed thank you very much this
is an opportunity for us to put in front
of the public hundreds of millions of
people the information that we&#39;re not
only alone in the universe but that the
people are going to make contact through
higher states of consciousness and
transform the situation on this planet
so that&#39;s that&#39;s really what it&#39;s about
wouldn&#39;t have happened without all of
you guys helping us and I want to thank
you from the depths of my heart and I
also want to thank those of you who
helped get the word out about this
because really we have a limited budget
for marketing you know we don&#39;t have a
studio multi hundred million dollar
operation here it&#39;s all through
donations and most people don&#39;t
understand that to get the word out on a
film like this so it stays then goes to
number one globally that&#39;s really driven
by you guys
and and it&#39;s more than anything it&#39;s how
you guys relate to other people take
what we&#39;ve sent out and post it across
the internet on your own channels on
your own social media and what have you
so that&#39;s really how this has happened
it&#39;s all very grassroots the other thing
is I think a number of people have
gotten the new app that we have is
called ce-5 contact so if you go to your
App Store and put in ce-5 contact you&#39;ll
see there&#39;s a new app that actually has
an ability for you to see who&#39;s in your
area or if you&#39;re traveling somewhere
who who&#39;s where you&#39;re traveling so you
can connect with them and make a CG five
team of course during this lockdown
situation with coronavirus you can do it
virtually like we&#39;re doing this live
event but eventually you&#39;ll be able to
go out together out under the stars and
it&#39;s an entire training manual it has
the science of consciousness meditations
how to do remote viewing how to do the
ce-5 of what we call coherent thought
sequencing where in consciousness you
make contact to these interstellar
civilizations and then just the
mechanics so how do you make a team
happen how do you how do you organize
that what is the the protocol so it&#39;s an
entire training program in an app and
and put it on top of it we&#39;ve added in
this into fantastic ability for people
to network with each other so that ce-5
contact app is what it&#39;s called and you
get in your normal app stores and
interestingly on google i think it was
number two under educational apps and on
itunes it&#39;s number three so there&#39;s all
again everyone who&#39;s participating in
that thank you very much I wanted a bit
a shout out to Josh Gordon who up in New
York he has a full-time job he&#39;s the
volunteer just like justice Campbell is
for the film but he is the one who
headed up the app development team
that&#39;s in India and we had a very modest
budget there are a few glitches with it
but be patient and just let the app
developer having a problem with some
functionality of it I don&#39;t understand
any of this stuff honestly
as my pet people will tell you I&#39;m one
knotch this side of a when it
comes to that kind of thing but I will
say that you know Josh Gordon is headed
that up and has done a great job on a
very limited time a scale and a very
limited budget so again thank you Josh
and thank you to the anonymous donor who
provided a hundred percent of the
funding for developing the app and he
wishes to be anonymous that&#39;s fine but
we&#39;re thanking him now anyway I mean if
you know who you are right so again
thanks to everyone so what I want to get
into now is a discussion about what
consciousness is and in particularly
higher states of consciousness so most
people when they hear of you know
consciousness movements they&#39;re
referring to what you are conscious of
which is not what we&#39;re talking about
here at all you know like for example
the women&#39;s movement or the gay rights
movement or civil rights movement it&#39;s
an awareness of a subject this what I&#39;m
talking about is the ability to be
conscious consciousness itself and what
does that mean what does it mean to be
Cynthia awake and to be aware of the
mind notice people never think of this
because I like this expressions from the
old Persian that is closer to us than
our lives thing it&#39;s so close to us we
don&#39;t think about it we don&#39;t
contemplate how is it that we&#39;re awake
and that we&#39;re perceiving whatever it is
we&#39;re perceiving well meditation is
about becoming aware of just the
awareness and going deeper and deeper
and more quiet and conscious mind where
the objects of perception your thoughts
what you&#39;re hearing what you&#39;re seeing
kind of recede away and you&#39;re really
expanded and your awareness being
conscious of the field of awareness
itself now why is that so important with
Close Encounters of the fifth time or
cg5 it&#39;s critical because any
interstellar civilization
their number one science after they&#39;ve
attained a level one civilization where
they have peace on their planet where
they have zero point
energy etc and are not damaging the
biosphere the number one science for
thousands of years becomes the science
of consciousness this is an absolute
fact once our civilization begins to
behave in a civilized way which we
aren&#39;t now and we stop murdering each
other and having Wars and destroying the
biosphere using 1800 fossil fuel systems
and all of that will then be liberated
to focus instead of on trying to money
grub and eke out an existence we&#39;ll be
able to focus on these deeper aspects of
what I call genuine spiritual
development of and the experience of
higher states of consciousness and that
becomes the key focus of any
civilization that attains level one
which is a peaceful world that&#39;s in
harmony with its environment not
destroying it but is very high-tech a
level one civilization and higher all of
them have is their chief science and
their main focus the development of
higher states of consciousness and as a
result their technologies track
correlate exactly with that so what that
means is that if you&#39;re dealing with an
interstellar civilization which is what
we&#39;re doing in contact with Close
Encounters of the fifth kind by
definition they&#39;ve gone beyond the speed
of light and when they&#39;ve gone beyond
the speed of light what I call the
crossing point of light like the sound
barrier you&#39;re in a whole nother
dimension it&#39;s a whole different law of
physics that are operating and the core
of that are increasingly conscious
dimensions thought visualization astral
celestial all kinds of aspects of energy
that are beyond the 3d material that
we&#39;re all so hung up on the reality is
most of the cosmos is resonating or
phasing beyond the speed of light and
this is beginning to be recognized by
fizz&#39;s
in the post quantum era and the reason
it&#39;s very interesting it&#39;s like full
circle if you look at the ancient
teachings of native peoples the ancient
even the Gnostic Christians you look at
the ancient Vedas the Sanskrit ancient
teachings from hundreds thousands of
years ago we don&#39;t know how old the
Vedas are in Sanskrit it predates any
organized religion including Hinduism or
Buddhism by the way and those bodies of
knowledge were all centered in the
science of consciousness so what I think
is that the field of consciousness and
that study is something that is not only
ancient the very futuristic ironically
and that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed now
civilizations that are going past the
speed of light if they don&#39;t understand
the science of consciousness they can&#39;t
do it they can&#39;t contact each other they
can&#39;t communicate through their own
planet etc and why is that
well we&#39;re using this system right now
we&#39;re on YouTube and we have phones that
are operating on radio frequencies which
are from 1844 Marconi Mr Cooney&#39;s Hill
and the Telegraph those are all
propagating in a wave form at 186,000
miles per second which is the speed of
light so every second is traveling
186,000 miles which sounds fast but it
isn&#39;t it&#39;s just too damn slow to go
interstellar so when you&#39;re going
interstellar let&#39;s talk about our nearby
star systems in our own galaxy say 1% of
the way across the Milky Way is since
it&#39;s a hundred thousand light years
across it&#39;s it&#39;s enormous in other words
a beam of light would take a hundred
thousand years to traverse just our own
galaxy which is one of billions or
trillions of galaxies each with a
hundred billion star systems or more so
when you look at that let&#39;s look at one
percent of the way across the Milky Way
that&#39;s a thousand light years a thousand
light years at the speed of how you and
I are communicating right now you take a
thousand years to say hello
another thousand years to get an answer
back how are you doing
they just took the time since the birth
of Christ so it is not possible that
we&#39;re being visited by civilizations
that haven&#39;t that have the help that are
walked into 3d material linear speed of
matter speed of light and that&#39;s why we
have to even if we&#39;re just emerging as a
civilization we have it within our
traditions but also within our own
unconscious experience the ability to
deeply understand that the consciousness
field is an unbounded field it&#39;s not
bound by space or time and that thought
emanating and moving in that field if
you can expand your awareness and see
with your mind a distant place or
distant time you can connect seamlessly
to it that&#39;s how these interstellar
civilizations understand reality and are
actually not just philosophically
understanding it but their operating
system let&#39;s say if they&#39;re oh s their
operating system is in the
transdimensional beyond the speed of
light fields of energy thought
consciousness conscious forms etc
therefore if we want to make contact we
can&#39;t expect them to be using you know
this thing you know with a piece of junk
that is using radio frequencies from the
1800s I mean it was all our voltage
smartphones and computers it&#39;s all
locked in an 1800s paradigm of linear
speed of light communication nevermind
our travel our travel systems are Jets
and cars that are really from the
eighteen hundred hundreds and early
nineteen hundreds burning fuels the
putter along at six hundred miles an
hour on a Boeing 787 dreamliner you know
I mean it&#39;s just completely ludicrous
because we have technologies that are
way beyond that and that&#39;s an
discussion but the point is when you see
an interstellar vehicle and it&#39;s come
from another star system even if it&#39;s in
our nearby cluster of stars in our own
galaxy they are not going at the speed
of light they&#39;re going at multiples of
speed of light then when you transcend
the speed of light the craft and
everyone on board are resonantly shifted
into these other dimensions I&#39;ll tell
you a little secret a lot of people
don&#39;t know you ever heard of dreamland
not the studio the Steven Spielberg has
streamline skg dreamland is a name of an
area at the Nellis Air Force Base Nevada
range the pop culture calls it area 51
but nobody calls it that by the way only
people don&#39;t know what&#39;s the air call it
area 51 nevertheless dreamland a way
that got its name is that when they were
experimenting with reverse engineer DT
craft in those technology with a
man-made system the people who were
using it were kind of teleported and
moved resonantly where their bodies and
the craft shifted into what is very
similar to the lucid dream state let me
repeat that if you have a dream where
you&#39;re flying over the ocean or the over
the forest or your city the body of
light that you&#39;re doing that with it&#39;s
very very similar to what an
interstellar vehicle or even
experimental man made one shifts into
when they&#39;re using high voltage systems
that are resonating in a way that all
the electrons and all the matter of that
spacecraft and people&#39;s bodies are
resonantly shifted in terms of frequency
to this beyond the speed of light aspect
and it isn&#39;t like you speed up to the
speed of light you&#39;re there in the end
of 3d and then you&#39;re dead there in
another dimension it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely
instantaneously and that explains if you
look at the movie Close Encounters of
the fifth time you&#39;ll see objects that
appear vanish and then
you&#39;re way over here or almost at the
same time there&#39;s no linearity to how
they have to move like a jetliner why is
that because they&#39;re using technologies
that enable them to transcend linear
space-time but as they do so not only
are there technologies more wedded to
this field of conscious energy but there
are communication systems are all
resonating in frequencies beyond the
speed of light they&#39;re moving at the
speed of thought now what is the speed
of thought what actually is
instantaneously and this is why even we
had dr. Tarr GaN who had worked for
20-some years for the CIA doing remote
viewing through Stanford Research
International he taught at SSRI which is
what people call it but I want to define
that for you it&#39;s SSRI at Stanford
Research International he talked about
the fact that the physics of this has
been well understood for decades but in
fact conscious the field of
consciousness and thought isn&#39;t limited
by space or time
and this is improving an elegant physics
science experience experiments so for
example where they would take the we
mentioned random number generators put
someone in a room and put their thought
of awareness on it and it sort of
shifting that this random generator of
zeros and ones shifts to the ones or you
could put your consciousness in a
container of water even at a great
distance and it will create as dr. Emoto
showed these of beautiful crystals and
forms if you&#39;re putting your attention
and love and hope or these ugly kind of
tormented looking shapes if it&#39;s hate or
something negative so thought and
consciousness instantaneously can affect
systems engineering systems at any
distance regardless of how far away
because they are not operating in a
linear 3d way they transcended at linear
3d cosmos so we have to do that if you
want to be an ambassador to these other
civilizations it&#39;s sort of like et
101 isn&#39;t what you&#39;ve been taught
through the UFO subculture et 101 the
course on extraterrestrial sciences is
the science of consciousness period
luckily you know this is something that
we all have an understanding of just
from our day-to-day experience an
enormous percentage of the population I
was talking to dr. Targa Baptists on a
private call not long ago have had what
are called lucid dreams of the future
how many of you guys have had that I bet
virtually everyone I met my wife in a
lucid precognitive dream if you&#39;ve read
the book hidden truth forbid knowledge
which is sort of roughly
autobiographical that I wrote some years
ago maybe 20 years ago or 18 I can&#39;t
remember that was a good part one of the
stories in there is how I was in the
Middle East
I had this lucid dream five days in a
row I was 22 years old I was no more
interested in being married than the man
in the moon at that point but I had this
dream where this enlightened being
introduced me to this woman who I never
seen on this plane and I was told very
specific information this is who you
should marry she&#39;ll be quite a bit
she&#39;ll be older than you but it won&#39;t
matter
she&#39;ll come from far away and leave but
you&#39;ll get back together and I&#39;ve used
all kinds of detail sort of in a packet
of knowledge I woke up and I was with a
friend I said you know I keep having
this dream about a month later maybe two
I can&#39;t remember this person my wife
Emily
walks through these Gardens
up in Israel where I was living in Haifa
and it was her now of course you don&#39;t
go up to a complete stranger and say hey
I&#39;ve had dreams with you babe I&#39;m gonna
marry you now I mean it&#39;s just crazy but
I eventually did tell her that story
after about a year of Correspondence
maybe not a year a little less and back
then there was no internet
this is 1978
for most of you were born I presume but
what I decided was you know I have to
tell her what really happened because we
had this instantaneous bond like we had
known each other forever even though we
knew each other only for about an hour
during that meeting in Israel before she
went back to the Caribbean where she was
a Peace Corps worker and I I thought to
myself you know I need to tell her how
this really happened of course luckily
she was a very spiritually minded
conscious person who did meditation so
she said oh yeah I understand that
so I tell people that all of us have had
that sort of like a pretty dramatic
version of a precognitive lucid dream
but we&#39;ve all had them but how does that
happen
think about it how is it that you go
into a state of consciousness or in you
fall asleep and during the dream time
with the aboriginals in Australia called
dream time you have a lucid crystal
clear full color dream and whatever that
is in that dream happens the next day or
the next week or the next month or 10
years later this is a very common
experience well what this sort of like a
thing that is experienced by almost
every human at some point in their life
that&#39;s a sort of a signpost that says
you&#39;re not only what you think you are
locked in the frame of your physical
form and in this time in place you&#39;re
actually connected in consciousness to
every point in space and every point in
time and that includes right now but
going back but going also forward which
is remote viewing into the future what
used to be called a seer
now this is something that has been
unfortunately sort of relegated to
mysticism and a lot of thinking is that
well you know you&#39;ve got to be somebody
living in a cave meditating for 50 years
by yourself to experience this this is
absolutely a harmful myth that I think
ecclesiastical and spiritual leaders
and unfortunately a lot of my scientific
brethren have propagated that is a
damnable lie you do not have to be in
some kind of esoteric ascetic setting to
have that experience or to develop them
and so that is something that we have to
begin to sort of move beyond this monkey
on our shoulders going oh I&#39;m just a
little dumb thing and I&#39;m just stuck
right here on earth and it&#39;s just you&#39;re
telling yourself that lie over and over
again and that it becomes its own
destiny because if you have a different
understanding of who and what you are
and that is that you are a conscious
being capable of connecting to the field
of consciousness that&#39;s beyond space and
time you can see any place you can see
any point in time you can remove you
where these interstellar civilizations
are you can connect them to their
communication systems which are not only
their innate capabilities like we have
telepathically but also they have
devices that would look like a box or a
device that seamlessly is interacting
with conscious thought so you in other
words you want to turn your computer on
you think to it and turns on of course
you know Elon Musk has a company called
neural link and by 2025 he wants to have
a system so that is he would have a
system where we would be able to do that
with our own computers here&#39;s a memo to
Elon if you&#39;re listening classified
projects have that already and I&#39;ve had
it since the 50s probably around 1956
nevertheless just using our own innate
ability because I don&#39;t have one of
those devices it was offered to me and I
turned it down because I knew it would
put me at greater risk than I need to be
because I also realize that I don&#39;t
really need to have it why because the
hardware the software let&#39;s call it that
you need to be an ambassador these
civilizations remote-view connect to
them in consciousness is your birthright
every single human being by
being conscious can be conscious of just
consciousness it can become aware that
field of awareness that has no
limitations in space or time and by
doing that regularly in meditative
States you then can then advance to
where you begin to operate at that level
not only in the meditative state or in a
dream but while you&#39;re driving down a
road you know you just sort of like but
where&#39;s the Highway Patrol or whatever
and you actually people know me well no
I do that kind of strange stuff but the
point I&#39;m making is that that you meet
to understand that this is your innate
capability as a higher intelligent
life-form of not just humans dolphins
men even other animals have that
capacity to a point but once you reach
Yorkers they say a critical mass of the
of intelligence and consciousness you
can understand this go into meditative
States on a regular basis and routinely
see remote places and see distant times
the most important sea e5s that I&#39;ve
been part of over the years and doing
this with groups of the West well this
is the 30th anniversary of the cg5
initiative I started the project when I
was 34 64 now that those experiences
almost who specific information was
experienced in a meditative state or
lucid dream before it happened for
example if you read the early accounts
that was going to Mexico near the
volcano they call cocodes cut that toll
something like that I&#39;m not very good
with languages except Sanskrit that
whole experience when you read about
that in the books that we have was seen
exactly seven days to the hour adjusted
for time zones 724 out of rotations of
the of the earth
and seven days after I had that dream we
were at this very specific place that I
was looking for and we were there at the
right place at the right time and this
enormous ship emerged from the volcano
and came right over and signaled to us
and all of that
so what I tell people is that you can
use this with let&#39;s say you&#39;re planning
to go out next weekend somewhere in your
backyard or State Park just with you
know your of your own housemates or
something you can actually intend as you
go to sleep at night or go into
meditation to ask where should I be
exactly what time might an event happen
what does the setting look like where is
the moon in the sky
whatever all the granular detail you
might if you intend to ask for that
it&#39;ll be shown to you and I think we&#39;re
only limited by our own creativity and I
think Yogananda had a great saying that
for the most part but humans are limited
by their own lack of adventuresome Ness
in other words we just ate we don&#39;t
believe we can do this because we&#39;re
told we can&#39;t which is a as I said a
damnable lie but on top of it we have
this tendency to limit our experimental
adventuresome Ness where we never just
sort of play with this and have fun with
it
so I tell people that once you sort of
realize that you can do this because
it&#39;s your own innate ability it doesn&#39;t
you don&#39;t have to be Ingo Swann or
Russell Targ or anyone else like that to
do this those people if you get to know
them well as as I did I got to know Ingo
Swann quite well he was laughs and you
say everyone can do this it&#39;s just they
don&#39;t believe they can and says they
believe they can&#39;t they don&#39;t it&#39;s a
little bit like that old saying you know
as you have faith so shall your powers
and blessings be in other words if you
don&#39;t believe you can do something
you&#39;re not going to do it because you&#39;ve
already programmed yourself to fail and
I think we have to sort of think about
how we were raised I know I was raised
in a very materialistic atheist family
incredibly poor I was starved as a child
beaten neglected had to put myself
through high school college med school
had a very very hard life and you so I
and and we were all told you can&#39;t do
anything and I had to sort of outgrow
that where I said well maybe I&#39;m not as
dumb as I was told and I will do stuff
than I did so you have to accept that
and your there&#39;s no one who can do that
for you you have to say okay I&#39;m on a
weight person I can learn some
meditation techniques I&#39;m not attached
to what techniques used by the way if it
fires your rockets go for honey but the
point is is that you have to first the
very first thing is to say wow you know
I really can&#39;t do this and then you
start experimenting with it you have fun
with it and that&#39;s sort of the very
beginning of the adventure let&#39;s call it
because once you say you can do it and
start playing with it all kinds of
magical things happen
I say magical only because they&#39;re
relegated to magic and mysticism because
our civilization has become so
materialistic that we&#39;ve denied our true
nature which is as conscious universal
beings but once we realize that each and
one of us are in fact not only awake but
the faculty within us of being aware and
conscious we can become deeply conscious
just of that field and become a seer of
the future a distant place and an
ambassador to these civilizations or you
can engage in remote healing where you
someone who is sick you put your
awareness on them and ask this this
great spirit this this unbounded field
of consciousness that is at the root of
our existence to help that person you
know and and if you if you think that
won&#39;t happen
that your thought of it not happening
will make it not happen if you actually
know it will and understand
consciousness is I&#39;m trying to do in
this sort of short YouTube video then
you realize it will work you know my dad
I I tell this I like telling personal
stories cuz it makes it real unless
abstract my dad he smoked probably three
packs a day for Lord 50 years and I was
living in the Middle East and I got a
call and said your dad&#39;s got a terminal
lung cancer and he had a very large
golf-ball-sized tumor in his right
mainstem hilum that the center part of
the chest that was inoperable and back
then this was nineteen I guess 78 79
there weren&#39;t great chemo therapeutic or
other treatments and my father was a
World War two veteran had really serious
PTSD we came to realize but he knew I
had become a meditation teacher and this
is before I was a medical doctor and so
I went home to see him I was told to
come home to sort of basically pick out
the coffin make arrangements from the be
buried
cuz they said he only had a few weeks to
live and so I came back and I said dad
do you want to die of this he said no I
don&#39;t and I said well i will teach you
meditation and then we will even though
i have to go back to the middle east
we&#39;ll do this together
and so i taught him this mantra
meditation that&#39;s in the ce-5 contact
app it&#39;s a simple of non-traumatic asian
approach and i also taught him some
visualization and he under he was very
highly intelligent man although he never
got to go to college or anything he sold
fencing at a Sears store and stuff I
think the most he ever made in a week
was 160 dollars or something but he was
very very bright so I said look you know
you have to just understand these simple
things and we&#39;ll do it so I went back to
Israel I would do these meditate
with him and also some prayer and ask
for healing he would do the meditations
and go into deep quiet mine and see the
tumor dissolving a few weeks later he
goes to his physician and they do x-ray
and it&#39;s gone I mean with no other trick
it just totally vanished he eventually
died of emphysema and all that from
smoking so much but he didn&#39;t die that
damn cancer and he didn&#39;t want to and he
didn&#39;t so I&#39;m not telling people not to
get medical treatments I&#39;m just saying
you can augment them greatly with
consciousness and what I learned at that
age I was maybe 22 or 23 is that really
even someone like my dad who had a
really damaged childhood had PTSD was in
hand-to-hand combat on an amphibious
unit in the Pacific during World War 2
that when he wanted to he could sit down
learn to do this meditation and when it
was something he felt was important it
worked
now why do I tell that story tonight is
because the work state of the world
right now is like we the whole planet
has terminal damn cancer so we have to
figure out how do we collectively come
together with the knowledge of the
science of consciousness the fact that
the conscious mind is always operating
without limits to location to space or
time and that if we empower it we can be
let&#39;s say a vehicle or a clear channel
for that force of good in the world by
coming together and the studies have all
shown whether it&#39;s a dr. da C who wrote
recovering the soul a great book about
prayer and meditation and healing that
when people do this and there are more
than one a group does it it has an
exponential increase in effect they
found the same thing with the random
number generators at the Princeton
engineering anomalies research lab dr.
John
had that you know and he&#39;s passed away
but I knew him and he loved what we were
doing he felt what we were doing in the
world was a applied version what he was
doing in the laboratory at Princeton and
they found that if like two people loved
each other and were unified harmonic and
they put their attention on those random
number generators the effect wasn&#39;t one
plus one is two
it was tenfold it was an order of
magnitude so this is where we get into
this discussion of what has been called
the 1% effect that you see in this
documentary is two-hour film which
obviously passes through a lot of
information very quickly you need to
look at it four or five times probably
but what you find is that when they&#39;ve
done studies with meditators and they
send them into a place and there&#39;s one
percent of the population that are there
meditating even though the other 99%
know they&#39;re not there in the city at
all they don&#39;t even know they find that
there&#39;s amazing changes that happen in
terms of violent crime rates emergency
room visits all kinds of negative social
and personal behavior just begins to go
down why is that it&#39;s because all of us
are in a field of consciousness and an
ocean of conscious light and when enough
people go into that deep state and then
in ten good it has an effect on everyone
it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re talking to
them like this or not it has a Salvatori
beneficial and positive effect now let&#39;s
imagine millions of people doing this in
mass meditations not only for humanity
and the earth but for our relationship
with these interstellar civilizations
that are waiting for us to awaken to
this possibility that&#39;s what they&#39;re
waiting for they&#39;re not waiting for the
president to issue an edict or the UN
secretary-general to put out a red
carpet or some state house or government
they&#39;re waiting for this this is what
they&#39;ve been waiting for since we
started the modern era
weapons of mass destruction and nuclear
bombs and these interstellar
civilizations appeared all over the
world on Moss deck in the 40s 50s 60s
they&#39;re waiting for humans to awaken to
a path of healing a path of
enlightenment and awakening to a new
civilization rather than a path of just
endless war in this destruction endless
egotistical focus because the opposite
of egotistical behavior is this ability
to connect to something greater than
yours or your own individuality but
realize your individuality when it&#39;s
connected to this larger conscious field
that&#39;s universal can be a force for
enormous good it&#39;s a paradox on the one
hand it&#39;s that pre-existent field of
consciousness is always there but the
activation of it and the change that can
happen on a planet like ours or in the
cosmos happens when people awaken to
that and that&#39;s part of the paradox and
mystery of existence so that&#39;s what
these civilizations are waiting for
they&#39;re not waiting for a political
solution the way we normally think of it
they&#39;re looking for a political social
movement let&#39;s call it but that is
rooted and understanding the science of
consciousness because they understand
that that would be the indication that a
civilization like ours which is an
incipient young rather atavistic I mean
you think about so many things we keep
sliding back to atavistic means though
the return to a primitive state a rather
primitive and not a good way state not a
childlike pure state but in a sort of a
savage violent state and we just need to
evolve to where we&#39;re connecting to it
this conscious field and understanding
that we all can do this together
you do not have to be an enlightened
avatar or a prophet or a yogi or
whatever in fact you know I think that
whole system
has become a crutch where we just sort
of pop out of our own responsibility and
look to some leader whether it be a
new-age one or a religious one or some
person who&#39;s some self anointed high
priest or whatever and that just takes
our own power away we need to say no we
each one of us have this ability and if
they&#39;re enlightened people who can help
share and teach other people that&#39;s a
very good thing there&#39;s nothing wrong
with that it&#39;s when we see that there
are people who have that ability that we
turn to and then view ourselves as
non-participatory as sort of passive
sheeple that just let that happen
without activating our own inherent
natural abilities so the science of
consciousness is really an ancient
ancient study it goes back since the
dawn of higher intelligent life forms on
this planet and elsewhere and you know I
can assure you that there are
civilizations on this planet that
predate our knowledge of Homo sapiens
with that were very high tech that
existed millions of years ago
tens of millions of years ago and that
we&#39;re at a phase now where in this let&#39;s
call it cycle of evolution that we have
to go from this age of reductionism and
separation and us versus them thinking
to an age of where I say is the unit of
state it&#39;s the state where we&#39;re
connecting to an aspect of all things
and all people and all creatures
throughout the cosmos through the field
of consciousness and why is that there&#39;s
a very practical reason for it I can
tell you having led thousands of people
around the world making contact and some
of those events you&#39;ve seen in in this
close encounters of the fifth kind
documentary people can get pretty
freaked out not because there&#39;s any harm
being done because it&#39;s something not
normal for them
the people who understand deeply that
these civilizations and those people I
call them that are non-human about home
people those the ones who get that most
clearly and see that those are just
different variants let&#39;s say of us
that&#39;s why the motto for our
organization is one universe one people
in reality there&#39;s one conscious being
phasing and resonating through all of us
so when you connect to that level of
consciousness I always say this why
never use the a word it&#39;s like the N
word or the K word or the F word the
alien word is inherently xenophobic and
racist
there&#39;s nothing alien about them except
unless you&#39;re connecting to only your
homo sapien as&#39; what do I mean by that
the fact that you are of one species
Homo sapiens humans to the exclusion
that anyone else is an alien but why are
they alien they&#39;re alien because we&#39;re
not connecting to the deeper spiritual
truth of the fact that we are conscious
and awakened sentient but when you look
into the eyes of these et beings they&#39;re
conscious and awake and sensing it
therefore if we&#39;re connecting at that
level which is a very simple level that
like I said it&#39;s closer to us than our
life&#39;s pain it&#39;s right there if we
connect to that level we&#39;ll be grounded
in where we have commonality and oneness
instead of alienness and foreignness and
fear which then leads to interstellar
racism which is what&#39;s going on mostly
in the UFO subculture you&#39;ll notice by
the way that the good aliens are always
once it kind of looks like you they came
from northern Europe and the bad ones or
ones that are a different color or
height or shape this is just us
projecting our own crap excuse my
language our own baggage of thousands of
years of race
ism and bigotry and inhumanity to each
other on to this situation and we&#39;ve got
to go beyond that we must transcend that
dynamic not only with each other so that
we can get beyond all the isms racism
homophobia sexism misogyny whatever it
is but we have to do that in a way we&#39;re
for it to last it can&#39;t just be an
intellectualization it&#39;s actually a deep
spiritual awakening where we realize
this is the heart of compassion of the
buddha by the way where we realize we
are all one being that the conscious
being within us and the light of
consciousness within another human or
another ET or another civilization from
a galaxy very far away
that conscious field is a singularity
it&#39;s one and by relating to that rather
than being overwhelmed by our
differences then we can stay in a
grounded place where we&#39;re not going to
be afraid and I always I like this story
in the bhagavad-gita where you know
Krishna is talking to Arjuna on the
battlefield and he said a little of this
and it&#39;s this with a capital T which is
referring to pure conscious the pure
field of consciousness eliminates all
fear why because if you&#39;re grounded in
that field of consciousness through
meditation and understanding there&#39;s
nothing to be afraid of you&#39;re you&#39;re
really at a place where you can go I&#39;m
sort of having eternal infinite
Universal aspect of myself that is in
perfect harmony and oneness with every
other being and that also makes you
realize that your life span on your this
planet at this particular life is also
not the end or beginning of things for
you it goes on forever I mean I guess
lucky in my case when I was a young
rambunctious and rather rebellious and
athletic teenager at age 17
I died it was a oh how lucky for you
well you know I was very sick and I did
a 30-mile mountain bike ride today but
this was I was 17 I decided in my
infinite wisdom to bicycle from
Charlotte North Carolina all the way to
the coast of North Carolina two hundred
miles in one day but I had injured my
left leg and that bike ride spread an
infection in that injury all through my
leg but I saw I&#39;m tend to be very stoic
I have a rather high pain tolerance and
I said oh well you know I&#39;ll just deal
with it and I bicycle 200 miles back
well of course that led to a catastrophe
where as a doctor now I realized I had a
pair of renal syndrome and sepsis where
the infection went off in my body shut
down my kidneys shut down my liver and I
died so I&#39;m 17 years old living in an
apartment I lied about my age that I was
20 now I&#39;m still working in high school
washing dishes that are Red Lobster&#39;s
actually pots and pans for a dollar a
day an hour and I was sort of like you
know not in great shape and I we did you
know in America those are you listening
from other parts of the world we don&#39;t
have we don&#39;t have a healthcare system
here we have a health profit system here
I say that as an emergency doctor on the
front lines and so I was too poor to
have a doctor I grew up so poor we
almost never saw one and I just oh well
so I went to bed and I died and I had
this amazing experience which goes is
too long to go into here I guess but
what it did the core about it taught me
even though I was raised a very devout
atheist it taught me that in fact our
inner conscious spirit is infinite a
eternal and that as I went out into
space I didn&#39;t go to some pearly gates I
just went into I was always in love with
space and the stars in the sky and
nature so I went out into space and I
went into
it was called Brahmin consciousness but
I went into a state where my
consciousness did the little drop that I
thought was my own consciousness
expanded it became the cosmic awareness
and but then I also became aware that
that consciousness was everything that
existed in creation from the celestial
to the material where I literally
experienced the planet and the stars in
space and time and the astral worlds of
light all as sort of the expression an
outer garment of this infinite self this
infinite being it was breathtaking and
beautiful but you know I didn&#39;t really I
mean I experienced it and understood it
on the experiential level but I didn&#39;t
have any knowledge I mean I I didn&#39;t
know anything but you knew this but I
began to study this and this is why on
my 18th birthday I learned Sanskrit
mantra meditation and then became a
meditation teacher so that&#39;s why I did
all of that before I became a medical
doctor but what it taught me was that
this is what everyone is it wasn&#39;t that
I was special at all I&#39;m not it in the
least it&#39;s that every single being who
can become aware of consciousness itself
has that folded within them it&#39;s a
beautiful saying you know there&#39;s
another old Persian I think it&#39;s thyself
a puny form when within the the universe
is folded in other words you think
you&#39;re a small thing when in reality the
totality of the entire cosmos and
creation is folded like a conscious
quantum hologram inside you and me and
everybody so that knowledge and
realization became was not academic
because you know fool that I was I just
wouldn&#39;t listen to my body and just
pushed and pushed and push myself I&#39;m
still a little bit that way aren&#39;t I but
here my son-in-law is going what are you
doing at your age doing all this
oh well I mean I&#39;ll rest when I drop
dead again or something that&#39;s my same
but I think that we have to understand
that this is what all of us are I mean
it you know whether it&#39;s the homeless
person on the street or is someone that
you rather like the Dalai Lama we all
have that within us and so understanding
that is so beautiful
and once we understand it and own it
then that&#39;s going to inform what we&#39;re
going to do we&#39;re going to aspire to
connect to that aspect and when we do
then we&#39;re going to be an ambassador to
the universe because then we&#39;re going to
understand that these other
civilizations that are beyond the speed
of light and their capabilities
understand all of this in their own way
and we understand it but we can relate
to it in a very simple form and that is
by going into deep conscious meditation
and initially when you&#39;re meditating
what happens is that you just sent some
quiet calmness of mind but as you do it
enough
day after day every day two three times
a day before you go to sleep it&#39;s sort
of a simple discipline you know it
doesn&#39;t take long 20-30 minutes what you
find is that you literally become
conscious of that field of awareness
when you&#39;re awake you start having more
and more lucid dreams and you&#39;re awake
doing your normal routine stuff and your
intuitive light you&#39;re sensing of things
that the five senses of your body kick
in this is really important when you&#39;re
out in the stars doing this because
you&#39;re not really there to see a machine
fly over and if you are you&#39;re there for
the wrong reason you&#39;re there to connect
to the occupants of those things called
ufos or ET crafts I mean this is the
whole problem with you apology is very
materialistic who cares about the
machinery it&#39;s like if a head of state
drives up to your house and of Mercedes
you&#39;re gonna ignore the world leader and
be fawning over the car well some of us
will because I love vehicles I&#39;m like a
boy that way but
no not really you&#39;re gonna pay attention
to what&#39;s the occupant of the vehicle so
in this case the quote UFOs are just
mechanisms for transport through
space-time but let&#39;s ask the question
who&#39;s on board who is that and how are
they different from us but how are they
like us and if you understand the depth
and richness of consciousness we have
more in common with those beings than we
have difference we are more alike than
we are dissimilar and also even as
humans the more we realize this the more
we&#39;re gonna transcend racism and
religiosity and ethnic conflict and
religious conflict because the truth is
if you however you feel and treat the
least amongst us is you&#39;re really doing
that tear so your quickest you have this
infinite aspect of yourself in it and
when you understand that that&#39;s where
you really can develop genuine kindness
or kind leanness that&#39;s a way to
function and we all try to aspire to
that all in perfectly of course in our
day to day lives but having these
experiences in deep consciousness and
field consciousness that are deeply
spiritual it enables us not only to be
like that with people but also with
these interstellar visitors we&#39;re not
we&#39;re not locked in to this idea that oh
my god there&#39;s a weird-looking alien
that&#39;s three feet tall or 12 inches tall
or 12 feet tall like we have some that
are very huge that come around us know
if you you realize that those are beans
that are conscious and intelligent and
the awareness within them even though
they experience the universe in their
own way as an individual or as a society
and we experience it in our own way that
the light of consciousness the
singularity of the consciousness field
is a singularity
and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so brilliant when
Ernst wrote in jurors of the father of
modern quantum physics and particle wave
theory yeah I believe in 1908 said the
total number of Mayans in the universe
is 1
it&#39;s a singularity now we divide it up
into our individuality z&#39; and thinking
we&#39;re all separate but the science has
proven that we&#39;re not all separate at
all we&#39;re always inner woven in this
this fabric of conscious awareness and
the more we meditate the more we have
that not as an intellectual ization up
here but as a genuine experience that
gives rise to knowledge and that gives
Robert Wise rise to wisdom and many
people will say how can dr. Greer say
that these aliens aren&#39;t harmful to us
I&#39;m going well you cannot prove a
negative but if they are shouldn&#39;t we
have a bunch of ambassadors that are
enlightened on this planet to make
contact with them and create a rock
Rocha moment I mean what were you&#39;re
going to resolve a problem like that
with people who have the ability to go
beyond the speed of light with a nuclear
weapon or electronic weapon no I mean
there&#39;d be the termination of both
planets instantly therefore no matter
what you your belief is given the
cacophony of opinions out there on this
the path of wisdom is that we become
ambassadors to the universe first by
understanding the universal aspect of
ourselves and then going out and making
contact with these civilizations while
we&#39;re established in that state of
consciousness because then there are no
aliens there are only fellow intelligent
beings and on that basis you can go
beyond the prejudices that kick in
we all have prejudices we&#39;re all raised
with with prejudices we all have them
but you can go beyond them so that on
the things that are really important and
we are in an interplanetary moment
that&#39;s been forced all for decades that
we began to come together and do the
right thing and become ambassadors of
enlightenment from humanity to these
civilizations and that&#39;s
urgent that&#39;s why I used the analogy
about my my father having cancer our
whole civilization has had a metastatic
metastasizing illness of separation and
violence and other necessities sort of
things that have brought us to the state
were in now and the only way that&#39;s
going to be solved if the external
solutions will will unfold when we
understand that deep within we have to
attain these the solution of
consciousness and enlightenment because
think about it for a moment let&#39;s say
that of course these have existed for a
hundred years you have a so-called free
energy device and it&#39;s a zero-point
energy device that energy device is
tapping into an inner infinite energy
field as Tesla Nikola Tesla called and
those systems yes they can run your
house and they can run your car and
aircraft that have no pollution but they
can be weaponized so how do you go
beyond our proclivity this sort of
illness that humans have to take every
technological development and use it
first for war
unfortunately classified projects have
done precisely that they have taken
technologies that have been evolved from
the early 20th century that were then
potentiated greatly potentiated in the
40s 50s and 60s by studying interstellar
vehicles and they have weaponized them
and they were out on satellites in space
they&#39;re on the ground they&#39;re under the
ocean and they&#39;re on aircraft and they
have been used against these
interstellar visitors so what I tell
people is that right now we have the
worst of all worlds because the least
conscious people have the most powerful
technologies what we have to do is
develop at least this 1% effect where 1%
of our population connecting to this
unit of state of consciousness
and wisely create a movement so that we
can not only make contact with these
civilizations peacefully but by joining
together in a 1% effect the other 99% of
humans will become more coherent less
violent and though it will potentiate
these technologies to come out and be
used to save the biosphere and so a lot
of people want to think of this
sequentially we need this and then I
said no sequentially could have happened
in 1908
maybe 1945 in 2020 my friends it&#39;s got
to all come together like hitting the
perfect score and we&#39;re just at a time
to do this in a linear and sequential
way you extrapolate where we are now if
we don&#39;t fix this problem in the next 10
to 30 years it&#39;s just going to be all
over but the shouting so this is an
urgent situation I always joke you know
I&#39;m an emergency doctor so maybe I see
the world that way but I think we&#39;re in
a genuine global emergency more and more
people are waking into that what they&#39;re
not awakening to is an a wise way of
having a solution so we have to have
conscious people coming together to
create a peaceful planet that is not
only a planetary society but an
interplanetary one so these technologies
can be applied in a way that is
beneficial to all life and doesn&#39;t get
create it doesn&#39;t create another
horrific weapon system so this is a very
is it once a material problem and a
scientific problem and a deeply
spiritual crisis all rolled into one the
reverse is also true
however on a hopeful note once a society
opens its eyes to that reality what
happens is that technologies just begin
to be potentiated without restriction
suppression secrecy that can do amazing
things but without any violent applique
so the root of this is creating a
civilization where we can advance
technologically at in parallel with not
an exclusion to our deep conscious
spiritual evolution and those two things
coming together is what&#39;s going to give
us as the et said the colonel Corso a
new world if you can take it I love that
story there&#39;s more to it than we relate
in the movie and but but I think it&#39;s
beautiful to realize that that&#39;s what we
have the potential for and that destiny
is in our hands it&#39;s not in the hands of
some elite cabal we like to go on and on
about them but in reality they&#39;re
they&#39;re just not that powerful compared
to eight billion people in the world
waking up to their own reality they
would be like a gnat flop flying into
the Sun which is by the way you know
when I got threatened by the head of
Army Intelligence and death threats and
people my team murdered and I got him a
malignant melanoma metastatic cancer
that almost took me out that was quite
artificially induced that you know back
then not before I had good protection
which I have now frankly it was very
dangerous but I was never afraid I think
my family children were I wasn&#39;t afraid
because you know I I told the head of
Army Intelligence I I&#39;ve seen what&#39;s
beyond the 3d cosmos and whatever you&#39;re
a little plan is there&#39;s another plan
and I can tell you which one&#39;s gonna
prevail it isn&#39;t yours I said that right
to his face in in 1992 in April of 1992
he was not happy because you know if
anyone who gets to know me knows I don&#39;t
suffer fools well and tend to be very
direct not you know it was in violent I
just said look you know you&#39;re not going
to intimidate us with this nonsense and
you can&#39;t deceive us so we have to be
wise enough and and become what are
called the you know like the Shambhala
warriors
Met tradition of the Shambhala kena
where they weren&#39;t warriors of violence
they were warriors in consciousness
where they as Arjuna was told by Krishna
they have gone beyond fear they&#39;ve gone
beyond multiplicity into this state of
oneness and therefore in your own
personal life you can take on any effort
you can cross any chasms and you can do
it without the normal insecurity and
fear that you have which is natural if
you just stay in your own head you know
your own space thinking that all that
exists is your physical body and this
little chunk of time maybe a hundred
years that you&#39;re on this planet so it
is really a spiritual crisis and crisis
in consciousness and as we understand
consciousness in its deepest aspect we
begin to understand what the future
holds in terms of a profound indeed
spirituality but that transcends that
the claptrap of let&#39;s call it
religiosity that ends up destroying
spirituality I think we have to
understand that at the core of many
spiritual traditions were really
beautiful inspired ideas but of course
then men got hold of it and destroyed
them didn&#39;t they so I think the only way
we&#39;re going to solve that problem also
is that we understand that we&#39;re all
have to be in a sense Yogi&#39;s or priests
we all have to be conscious and
enlightenment it isn&#39;t enough to bend a
pious knee once a week at a church or a
temple we have to understand that within
our and that maybe if that is something
hopeful for you that&#39;s great but we have
to understand that that that&#39;s just to
remind us of what we need to be all the
time every day all the time and it has
amazing applications I mean as an
emergency doctor I told some to some
really kind of funny stories don&#39;t know
if you want to hear these on a Saturday
night
but they&#39;re sort of beautiful like I had
this boy that came in as a young man he
was like 26 and he had two kids and it
was since this is coronavirus he had it
was flu season and everyone thought he
had a really bad case of the flu so he&#39;s
put into a he wasn&#39;t in a trauma room he
was in a regular medical room I go in
and see him and I could I would never be
able to say this if I was still in a
hospital right now because I&#39;d be
crucified as a sort of a charlatan
or worse and my medical license taken
away I guess but I looked at him and I
you don&#39;t have dogs just sort of sense
things they can sit I&#39;m kind of like a
big dog that way I could just sense I
could feel that he had this big brain
tumor and I also sensed that all of his
symptoms every one of them was due to
this big brain tumor so I turned to the
nurse and I said I need an emergency cat
scan CT of the hip and she was fantastic
what a saw the earth North character
graer
he&#39;s only got the flu and I went just do
it it was you know look I didn&#39;t have to
go through a bunch of Nazis an HMO or
insurance or government so we got the
cat scan and sure enough there was this
big brain tumor but it was a type of
exercise oh no it was a type of brain
tumor that was like a pancake on the top
of here and it was squeezing his brain
had reached a critical size where it was
it was pushing his brainstem where you
have the areas of control for vomiting
breathing temperature regulation was all
being affected so he had all these
symptoms that were exactly like the flu
no other neurological symptoms and all
of them were from this hidden brain
tumor now when I handed this off to the
neurosurgeon he said to me he says why
did you order a cat scan on this patient
I never would have I said I couldn&#39;t
tell them what I&#39;m telling you
it&#39;s someday hopefully a medical school
we can teach our doctors this I said
well I just had a hunch but in reality I
saw felt this brain tuned so it saved
that boy&#39;s life and you know whether
you&#39;re an airline pilot or computer
programmer or a CEO or a nurse or a
doctor whatever you do or you&#39;re a truck
driver and you need to anticipate
something up over the horizon that you
can&#39;t see with your eyeball
being awake in this field of
consciousness is incredibly beautiful
and important and it can be life and
death so I think we have to accept that
this is the wonder of our time is that
we can merge science and technology with
the experience of consciousness in its
deepest aspect and become truly awake
well with that I&#39;m gonna let a couple
questions come in I know I&#39;ve gone on a
bit long but I wanted to just give an
overview of this I hope you guys enjoyed
it
Michael do you have a question from the
folks absolutely dr. Greer great show
tonight
first question is is the ce-5 movement
being opposed by religious
fundamentalists inside of the US
government everything enlightened is
opposed by fundamentalists whether
they&#39;re in the government or elsewhere
and I mean that in the sense that there
is a big problem with people who are
