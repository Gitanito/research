my name&#39;s Nick Pope I&#39;m a serving
official with British Ministry of
Defense which I joined in 1985 I&#39;ve done
a number of different tours of duty
they&#39;re the most relevant of which is
from 1991 to 1994 when I was posted to a
division called Secretariat air staff
and my duties there were to research and
investigate the UFO phenomenon for the
British government
I received somewhere between two and
three hundred UFO reports each year and
my job was to evaluate these to come to
a decision about whether there was
evidence of any threat to the defence of
the United Kingdom now after an in-depth
investigation 90 to 95 percent of those
sightings turned out to have prosaic
explanations but we were left with a
hard core of sightings which defied any
conventional explanation whatsoever and
these were a bunch of interesting cases
involving sightings by military
personnel near misses between UFOs and
aircraft instances where UFOs were
tracked on radar and cases where UFOs
were captured on film and video over the
years in which the British government
has been looking at the UFO phenomena
there have been numerous cases on which
uncorrelated targets have been tracked
by military fighter controllers and
certainly on a number of those occasions
military jets were either diverted from
task or indeed scrambled to try and
intercept these objects not to engage
them in any hostile sense but merely to
close with them to identify them now on
those occasions I have to say we have
not been successful in our attempts to
to make an interception invariably we
find that the speeds and maneuvers of
the UFOs are way ahead of the best
things in our inventory with regard to
craft so they run rings around us
frankly on occasion when military jets
have actually been chasing UFOs to try
and maybe get gun camera footage or to
try and close within visual range to get
an ID on what the the mystery craft is
these things have shown not only are
they capable of phenomenal bursts of
speed but also the capacity to just stop
and turn in an instant
raising all sorts of issues about the
the g-force implicit in such a maneuver
g-forces which frankly even with the the
best G suit would be far too much I
think for any human to survive so that
in itself raises interesting questions
about who&#39;s operating these things to
pick a few cases to talk about which are
particularly impressive I think one has
to perhaps start back in 1956 say with a
radar visual sighting that took place
near the Bentwaters area and on this
occasion and incidentally this was one
of the cases written up in Project Blue
Book and judged to be particularly
significant now to cut a long story
short there were fighter controllers who
picked up a radar target which was not
readily identifiable as one of our own
aircraft so we simply took a look at
that and judged that there was indeed a
solid structured craft in the air it was
traveling at a phenomenal speed compared
to the envelope as it were of our own
fighters so Jets were launched and
indeed the pilots did manage to close
and get a visual sighting on this object
they they just described it I think
really as some sort of structured
possibly disc shaped craft but frankly
it was just too fast and maneuverable
for them to get a really
Clearview and again it ran rings around
them so that was an interesting example
one of many of these crafts displaying
speeds and maneuvers which we couldn&#39;t
hope to merge now to throw in a an
example of a much more modern sighting
and one that I was directly involved in
in the investigation of on the 30th and
31st of March 1993 a series of UFO
encounters took place over Great Britain
the most interesting of which involved
an occasion where two Air Force bases
were actually over flown by a large
triangular or diamond-shaped UFO
now the two establishments involved in
this are RAF Cosford and RAF Shawbury in
the Midlands at RAF Cosford the guard
patrol this happened in fact this part
of the sighting happened in the early
hours of 31st about 10 past 1:00 in the
morning the guard patrol at Cosford saw
this UFO flight directly over the base
they of course phoned in an immediate
report found interestingly there was
nothing showing up on radar at all even
though they had this thing going right
over their heads they phoned
amongst other people their colleagues at
RAF Shawbury which is about 10 or 12
miles down the road and the
meteorological officer took the phone
call now you have to understand there is
only a skeleton staff at these
establishments so the Met officer there
took the call went outside perhaps just
thinking really that this was perhaps
people playing a trick on him but sure
enough in the distance he saw a bright
light heading his way this thing got
closer and closer and the way he
described it to me voice shaking with
emotion the following morning was like a
massive flat triangular shaped craft
possibly raised a little bit like a
diamond passing over his head and a
height
maybe no more than 200 feet slightly to
one side emitting a low-frequency
humming sound which he said that he
could not only hear but feel
intriguingly this craft was firing a
narrow beam of light down at the fields
just beyond the perimeter fence of the
military base and he said that this this
object came towards him at a speed of
probably no more than twenty or thirty
miles an hour very slow suddenly the
light retracted up into the craft and in
instant it shot off to the horizon in a
matter of seconds and he said bear in
mind this is a an Air Force officer with
eight years experience in the service he
sees aircraft and fast jets every day of
his life and he said well the speed of
this thing was probably about 10 times
the speed of an Air Force jet and when
asked when I asked him to estimate the
size of this this mystery craft with
typical military precision he said it
was probably midway between a c-130
Hercules transport aircraft and a Boeing
747 jumbo jet
now I launched a full investigation into
this incident and in fact this was one
of a series of sightings that took place
over the entire country on that
particular night involving not just
members of the public but numerous
police officers particularly in the
southwest of England and in Wales and
also in the Midlands now I made all the
usual checks we impounded the radar
tapes and had them sent up to Ministry
of Defence main building
we checked the radar tapes at first we
thought we might have something but we
we eliminated that out as really just
anomalous propagation and we made all
the series of checks that we could
possibly make checking for everything
from satellite tracks and re-entry into
the Earth&#39;s orbit of spare space debris
to astronomical phenomena meteorites
fireballs
satellite tracks military aircraft
exercises when the balloon launch is
however unlikely this was we checked
that that was always the philosophy you
check everything in this business we
drew a complete blank and at the end of
about a week or so of pretty solid work
on this I put a report up the chain of
command through my head of division to
the assistant chief of the air staff an
air vice-marshal so I think yes a
two-star Air Force officer we put this
up to him and we basically said that an
uncorrelated target an unidentified
craft but a you know not just a light or
a shape a structured craft of unknown
origin penetrated what we killed the the
UK ADR that that&#39;s the United Kingdom
air defense region on that particular
night flew without being tracked on
radar without any aircraft being
launched flew with total impunity over
two military establishments and over a
large part of the rest of the country
and then disappeared object unexplained
the assistant chief of the air staff
thought long and hard about that and I
suppose it was a catch-22 situation he
simply came back and he said well that&#39;s
very interesting case but you&#39;ve clearly
run all the checks that you can make
there is frankly nothing more we can do
but it&#39;s fascinating now I think when
that went up the chain of command and I
can&#39;t recall although I suspect it did
whether it went to defense ministers or
not and indeed up to chief of the
Defence Staff and Secretary of State for
Defence but I think whatever the nature
and the unsatisfactory nature of the
conclusion we certainly changed a few
people&#39;s minds there about the whole
nature of the UFO phenomenon and we got
I think a number of senior civil
servants and military officers to really
realize on their watch
as it were that this was not just stuff
and nonsense that the UFO phenomenon is
not just lights and shapes in the sky
it&#39;s it&#39;s real it&#39;s solid it can involve
the military as much as anyone else and
I think that that remains one of the
most significant cases ever to have
taken place in Britain and frankly it
shows if indeed there is any doubt
remaining the serious defence and
national security issues raised by the
whole UFO phenomenon over the years
there have been a number of films taken
by military aircraft through gun cameras
now unfortunately this film footage and
again I checked it does not seem to
exist anymore now interestingly one of
my predecessors who headed up the
division where I worked under its
previous title of ds8 that his defense
Secretariat aide was a man called Ralph
Noyes and he is someone who before his
death also as a Ministry of Defense
employee spoke out publicly about the
reality of the UFO phenomenon and made
the point to all who would listen that
there was a serious phenomenon here and
it did need and deserve serious study
now Ralph certainly did see those bits
of film footage and Ralph told me and
indeed I think he&#39;s his testimony has
gone on to the written record as well he
did tell me that he was called to a
briefing of senior Air Force personnel
and that they all gathered around to
look at some of this footage that had
come after a chase where a military jet
had been sent up to try and get a closer
look at a UFO and Ralph&#39;s noise told me
that he and all these people on the air
staff just sat around gasping with
astonishment looking pointing wondering
but but frankly not able to really take
it that much further except again the
implicit acknowledgement that there are
things operating in our airspace which
have better capabilities than we do and
when I say that of course I include the
point about prototype craft because one
of the points that is often put forward
about the UFO phenomenon is is the I
suppose fairly reasonable question well
couldn&#39;t it be that what you&#39;re seeing
when you talk about structured craft
with high speeds and extraordinary
maneuvers is just the next generation of
Air Force air planes prototype devices
whether they be aircraft or remotely
piloted vehicles well speaking as a
serving member of the Ministry of
Defense and having done the UFO job for
three years I can tell anyone who makes
that point that yes of course at any
given time there are prototype aircraft
and devices that we operate but we know
where we operate our own bits of kit we
operate them in very carefully
controlled and defined ranges and danger
areas and we do not make mistakes about
UFOs and prototypes we don&#39;t go chasing
UFOs if it&#39;s a prototype we can tell the
difference so when the public see
something you know who knows it depends
where they see it but when we&#39;re talking
about military sightings and when we&#39;re
talking about the research and
investigation that I did if I had
stumbled on to a prototype test then AI
would have known and B if I hadn&#39;t have
known I would have been told and of
course we would have butted out of that
pretty quick Britain&#39;s most famous UFO
case is the Rendlesham forest incident
which is sometimes also referred to us
as the Bentwaters case now that involved
a series of UFO incidents over a number
of nights in December of 1980 involving
the in fact they are nominally Royal Air
Force bases but in fact of course they
were operated by the United States Air
Force RAF Bentwaters
and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk now here
there were a series of encounters where
some people saw lights in the sky
performing extraordinary maneuvers but
perhaps much more significantly on the
first night of activity people saw a
structured metallic craft actually
moving not not up in the sky but right
down pretty much at ground level moving
through Rendlesham forest which joins
the two bases and at one point this
small metallic roughly triangular shaped
craft seemed to actually come down and
land in a particular clearing now all
the witnesses to this a military
personnel they&#39;re trained observers they
don&#39;t make mistakes some of the skeptics
have suggested that this could have been
a mistaken sighting of a nearby a
lighthouse that&#39;s nonsense for two
reasons firstly these were trained
military observers who actually were
filming familiar with the lighthouse and
saw it pretty much every night of their
tour of duty but secondly at certainly
at one point in the encounter the
lighthouse was clearly visible at the
same time as the UFO so this simply
could not have been the White House as
the skeptics sometimes suggest now I
have although of course this case
predated my own tour of duty really by
by 10 years a little more I reviewed the
case and I looked through the file and I
tried to reopen the investigation into
this incident the most important thing
that I was able to focus on was in fact
physical evidence that something had
taken place because after this craft had
touched down people went back in the
light of day to the landing site and
found that where they&#39;d seen this craft
land there were in fact three triangular
indentations in the forest floor what I
mean by that is there were three
indentations which when you
drew lines between them were pretty much
in the shape of a perfect equilateral
triangle now one of the things that was
done was that the area was checked for
radiation and this is where I came in
I took the readings that were taken and
it&#39;s important to say these readings
peaked in two places they peaked in the
indentations themselves and also some
damage that was done to the sides of the
trees in the clearing and if this thing
had come down and snapped off some
branches and stripped off some bark as
it had done so either coming in or going
out now I sent the figures that had been
recorded at the time by lefthand Colonel
Charles halt who was the deputy base
commander himself a witness to some of
these incidents I
I sent the data from Holt and his team
to the defense radiological protection
service which is part of the Ministry of
Defense and they came back to me and
they were frankly bemused by this whole
thing and they said that the the
radiations from the indentations in the
ground were ten times background for
that area ten times what they they
should have been now of course it is
important to say that the levels were
still comparatively low Holt and his
team were not endangered by this this
was still low-level radiation but again
looking at it from a scientific point of
view that&#39;s not the point the point is
that when compared with as it were
control readings immediately outside of
the area
you had these this peak of ten times
normal right where this thing whatever
it was came down on the forest floor so
that I think is extremely significant
because it involved not only sightings
by trained military observers and also I
I should mention that at one point this
craft was tracked on radar from a nearby
base
RAF Wotton so you had sightings on radar
sightings by trained military personnel
and after the event in the cold light of
day the undeniable scientific
methodological evidence of the radiation
readings so that by anyone&#39;s standards
has to be an extremely significant event
and proof I think beyond all question of
doubt that there was an unknown craft in
that particular clearing on that
particular night and I have seen witness
statements from them and I&#39;ve heard
testimony from some of those involved to
suggest that much more went on on that
particular night than even went into the
file that ended up in the Ministry of
Defence where it&#39;s claimed that UFOs
have taken an extreme interest in
civilian nuclear power stations military
installations with nuclear assets there
during my tour of duty in secretary and
here staff at the Ministry of Defence I
operated I hope a very open policy with
regard to the UFO s you and I made it my
business to be be quite open and honest
about the official research and
investigation that I was doing and not
to suppress any data on this I believe
that governments and the military and
indeed private researchers politicians
whoever you know everything should be in
the public domain on this issue
governments can&#39;t I think have it both
ways
you cannot say on the one hand as the
party line often goes that UFOs are of
no defense significance and then on the
other keep bagged some of the data you
simply can&#39;t do that you have to have it
one way or the other and if as
government&#39;s consistently say as it were
when they that the politicians probe on
this issue or when the media inquire
that there&#39;s really nothing to worry
about then okay let&#39;s see all the data
and let&#39;s check that that decision is a
valid one reached through a proper
methodology now I in support of that aim
believe that there should be a full
disclosure of all information on UFOs
held by governments all around the world
I think there are some encouraging signs
that that&#39;s beginning to happen I know
for example that early in 2000 at a
conference in San Marino which was part
sponsored by the Ministry of Tourism
there so it had a an official flavour to
it the Italian Air Force actually sent a
delegation on duty in uniform to talk
about UFO cases received by the Italian
Air Force and Ministry of Defence over
the years now I&#39;m also aware that this
has happened in Chile and as I&#39;ve said
my own efforts to try and be very open
with this and to push data into the
public domain as well I I hope have
taken the issue forward somewhat but yes
I am a supporter of total openness and
honesty on this issue clearly it&#39;s a
very important issue one which I&#39;ve made
no secret of the fact I think raises
important defence and national security
issues but these are not issues that
should be addressed by a small clique
and and any one grouping of people these
are issues of global significance which
should be addressed and debated by
everyone and indeed we cannot make a
full and proper assessment of the
phenomenal data we have without bringing
in all sorts of people scientists
politicians military experts in a much
wider way than perhaps this information
is available now I&#39;ve made no secret of
the fact that I believe some of these
UFOs may well be of extraterrestrial
origin now I know that that&#39;s an
extraordinary statement for a serving
officer in the
defends to me I don&#39;t make it of course
as an official announcement it is of
course speaking in a private capacity
but it is meat speaking on the basis of
three years official research
investigation three years of me looking
new sightings coming in and reviewing
the 250 or 300 odd cases
sorry Case Files of me reviewing the 250
or 300 files held by either the Ministry
of Defense or the public record office
on the UFO sto some of which will
classified secret at the time so I don&#39;t
make these statements like and I don&#39;t
do so on the basis of a blind leap of
faith I do it on the basis of the data
held by government it&#39;s important as
well to say I am NOT alone in this
belief that even within the Ministry of
Defence in Britain and the airforce and
indeed political establishment I am NOT
a lone voice here the Ministry of
Defence is is not a great indivisible
organization like anything else it is a
collection of individuals so when you
talk about government the military and
the establishment whatever grouping you
talk about what you&#39;re really talking
about is a group of individuals and I
found that there are skeptics and
believers in the world of official term
and there are more believers in an
extraterrestrial presence than many
might suspect particularly in the Air
Force largely I suspect because when you
actually think about it a lot of people
I&#39;ve tested this myself have gone out
but I&#39;ve spoken to people socially and
in the margins of meetings and courses
and such like when you go out and speak
to the Air Force in Britain somebody may
have had a sighting somebody may have
tracked an unprotected target on radar
see it do maneuvers that we couldn&#39;t
possibly manage either somebody has had
these experiences themselves on those of
some
a friend a colleague who&#39;s had the same
thing so I&#39;m not saying that there is an
acceptance of an extraterrestrial
reality but there is certainly more
belief than you might suspect at the
beginning of my tour of duty I did makes
me to establish a dialogue with opposite
numbers particularly in America now I
was given the party line I guess that
usually the Americans had been out of
the UFO investigation game since 1969
when Project Blue Book was closed down
I didn&#39;t frankly have time to follow
that up and probe deeper did you receive
any confirmation I don&#39;t want to talk
I&#39;m afraid about any liaison with
certain agencies on this all I will say
in very general terms is that if I had a
particularly interesting case on which I
felt I needed systems from any other
agency with any other capability or bit
of hardware then I would ask through
channels but really most of the UFO
cases that came my way I was happy with
the assets that I had and you know
really did day-to-day research and
investigation using national assets such
as the UK air defense region radar
stations the ballistic missile early
warning center at RAF foiling tales and
suchlike but I don&#39;t want to go much
further than that
suffice to say that there have been a
steady stream over the years of good
quality cases which I think would
convince any open-minded observer who
actually looked at the data that there
was something here which went
significantly further than than just the
light in the sky and something which
whatever the the claims that are some
homes made about this phenomenon suggest
that something of extreme defense
significance is happening not just in UK
airspace but indeed I think of airspace
all around the world in Britain at the
public record office at present there
are about 30 UFO FILES open to the
public now in total I believe there are
between around about 250 and 300 files
and some of those were classified secret
now of course Declassified Britain will
get its Freedom of Information Act
shortly and I hope and believe that most
if not all of the British government and
military UFO FILES will soon be released
what there is however is a body of
evidence which when placed end-to-end
and looked at by any dispassionate
observer with any military of scientific
experience will I think constitute proof
of the reality of this phenomenon one
important fact about the British wave of
sightings in March 1993 was that it
happened three years to the very night
after the wave of sightings that rocked
the establishment in Belgium and led to
the scrambling of f-16s again was late
on 30th and in the early hours of the
31st of March so it&#39;s it&#39;s one of those
very interesting facts that perhaps two
of Europe&#39;s most significant UFO waves
actually happened on the very same night
of the year three years apart now what
that means I don&#39;t know it&#39;s certainly
significant I think one of the things
we&#39;re taught in government is don&#39;t
believe in coincidences so there&#39;s
something there perhaps I think it&#39;s
been suggested
as a an indicator of some sort of
intelligence behind these craft one one
theory is that it has to do with media
coverage it&#39;s the one night perhaps that
you can get away with flying solo over
military bases and so close to the
ground over a populated area and the
reason for that is that it will happen
too late to be reported in the media on
the 31st of March so if it makes the the
press and the TV news the story will run
on the 1st of April so that might mean
that people will disregard the story and
treat it as what we call an April Fool&#39;s
joke although it predated my involvement
one of the most significant waves of
sighting in Europe took place over
Belgium in March of 1990 and on that
occasion UFOs were seen by large numbers
of people on the ground and tracked on
radar resulting in two f-16 fighter
intercept as being scrambled these
aircraft then picked up the UFO
themselves on their airborne radar and
an intriguing game of cat-and-mouse
played itself out in the skies of
Belgium over the next hour or so now
although that happened before I was
posted into Secretariat Air Staff I did
simply because I was aware of it and
because it was clearly a significant
case make contact with the British air
attache in Brussels and I asked him
really for my own peace of mind
and for my own background research to
confirm the reality of that and he had
certainly spoken directly I believe to
one or both of the steam pilots and to
to the senior military officer involved
in this Count de Brouwer and certainly
the word that came back to me officially
what our empathy what yep&#39;s incident
happened pretty much has reported yes
that was a solid structured craft there
with speeds and maneuvers way ahead of
the f-16s
and as a sort of unofficial aside there
was a kind of jokey comment going round
certainly the the Belgian Air Staff
which was to the effect of well thank
goodness they were friendly
there was a there was a huge cash in the
land were or something in craft and it
didn&#39;t break anything you know you know
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever been to a
crash site where and he had you know a
trees you know just broken like Mike and
half everything was burned and it was
like like if you had almost cut like a
warm butter with a knife
