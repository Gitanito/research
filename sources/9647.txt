  		              		Experience Description   

    Although I did not find out the 'Adult Details' until I was about age 25, I knew something unusual had happened to me as a kid.    All my life, I'd remembered an unusual experience that was too vivid to be a dream.  I never remember dreams, but I remembered this.  
  
  At about age 3, I remembered walking up a beautiful stairway made of  translucent pink marble. I was wearing those child pajamas with the  plastic foot pads and elastic around the ankles, which I can still 'feel.'  I was walking up a beautiful, curved stairway with a compassionate and caring female who reminded me of the  'Good Fairy' to my child's mind.  She  wore a light blue, shimmering and diaphanous gown with a belt around the waist. She didn't have wings, was  not earthly, and was very kind.  I remember feeling secure around her although no  words were spoken.  As we ascended the staircase, I remember looking to my left and seeing what looked like a black, velvety background but it held a vista of enormous, spinning jewels and planets. One looked like the planet Saturn and others that I later learned about because I obviously did not know about planets at age 3.  One jewel that particularly stands out, for some reason, was a gigantic ruby like one  cut by a jeweler and  something like one would see in the Crown Jewels.  

  We slowly ascended to a landing where another female angel/good fairy sat waiting.  We paused, and this female 'spoke' to me. Even at such a young age, I sensed she was more 'important.' It was a brief exchange. I remember nothing except that her gown was of a different color, but of the same type as my escort.  The stairway curved more tightly to the right, and I sensed I may have been on the outside stairway of perhaps a building/city, as the planets and jewels  were open and  to our left. The right side, which seemed too 'adult' and uninteresting, held little fascination for me.

    As we slowly kept climbing, her hand securely and motherly-like grasping mine,  we came to the last entity. She was of greater wisdom and importance. She also had the same  type of gown but a little more embellished than the other two.  Here it was different. She helped me up onto her lap and there was some kind of 'communication' but I don't remember  what was communicated. Then,  I can remember sailing back into my parent's house. As I did, I saw in our front yard, a tree with every kind of fruit hanging on it:  bananas, apples, pears, pineapples, all fruits, ready for the eating. Our house was  in Kansas!  I have since looked at old photos. There was never a tree in that spot, just one outside the bedroom window.   I vaguely remember returning to my body through the bedroom window.  

    While I was growing up, I had an overwhelming curiosity about - not exactly death, but the afterlife.  Occasionally, I hear friends mention their grandparent's death-bed visions and the like, and I'd grill them for details.  When JFK was shot, that was momentous because it was my first funeral.  I could not be satisfied on the subject. I just assumed I was a weird and sensitive kid, especially with animals, or the vulnerable people types such as  the infirm or mentally-challenged. I've had over-empathy all my life.  I grew up to be drawn to religions, mysticism, meditation, movies about God, anything to satisfy this quest for 'what's next?'

    Skip to 1978, 23 years later.  Driving with my mom to her brother's funeral one day, I began asking why I knew so little about the maternal side of the family. My mother  told me that grandma  had lived with us when I was very young and she   was exhibiting signs of dementia. She snuck  up on me while I was sleeping in a crib in my folks bedroom. Then she  smothered me with a pillow!  Obviously, I knew nothing of this.

    Mom heard the commotion, and  saw that I was  blue. She freaks out and ran across the street to a our neighbor, a physician-intern.  He did some kind of early 1950s CPR on me, and I'm still on here.  Grandma went off to the  Insane Asylum in her home state where she died a short time later.
