  		              		Experience Description   

  I woke up from my bed in the middle of the night from a bad headache.  I was walking to the window to get some fresh air.  I started to see more and more black spots. Then I collapsed  as I passed out as everything went black. 

  I knew that I was dead.  I felt no pain and  I felt  enormous freedom as I left my body.  There was an enormous emptiness and  silence that I had never heard before.  I felt extremely strong feelings that I have never felt before.  I did not want to go back to my body because in my body there was pain. I heard a voice that said, 'It is not your time now.' It was like I have heard that voice before. 
  
  Then I started to hear my heartbeat.  It was loud, almost like I was inside my heart.  I knew I was going back to my body and then I started to feel extreme pain coming from the back of my head. Then I was back in my body, I stood up slowly, and went back to my bed.
