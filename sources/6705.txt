Alice Johnson was born in Cambridge and studied natural sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge. When the Balfour Laboratory was inaugurated there in 1884 she was appointed its first Demonstrator in Animal Morphology.

In 1889, she took part in the first series of sittings given to psychical researchers by the medium Leonora Piper in England. The following year she assisted Eleanor Sidgwick, a leading member of the Society for Psychical Research, in carrying out telepathy experiments with the use of hypnosis.1

In 1890, she was appointed private secretary to Eleanor Sidgwick and secretary of the Society for Psychical Research, holding the post from 1903 to 1907 and that of research officer from 1907 to 1916. She edited the society’s published proceedings from 1899 to 1916. Working with Henry and Eleanor Sidgwick, Frederic Myers and Frank Podmore she helped produce the report of the Census of Hallucinations in 1894, the largest such survey of anomalous experiences ever made.&nbsp;

Much of Johnson’s research was associated with the phenomena of mental mediumship produced by Piper and other mediums, and by practitioners of automatic writing. Her detailed studies of automatic scripts written by the medium Alice Fleming (‘Mrs Holland’) were published in the society’s proceedings.2 &nbsp;She also contributed reports of sittings with the physical medium Eusapia Palladino3 and the hallucinatory experiences of a‘Mr Grunbaum’ in America.4

Johnson was particularly interested in the nature of coincidences,5 which she explored with personal case histories. &nbsp;and concluded that if a number of unlikely coincidences seemed to be statistically more numerous than obvious examples of chance, then a case could be made for their having a paranormal origin.6

Johnson was responsible for bringing to publication the book&nbsp;Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death by&nbsp;Frederic Myers, the society's leading theorist, who had died in 1901 leaving it unfinished.&nbsp;  Select Publications  Articles
