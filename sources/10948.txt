My name is Mercedes, and I'm from Ecuador, but live in Santiago, Chile. I listened to Doctor Jeffrey Long on Coast to Coast Am and visited your website. I don't have a near death experience of my own, but I would like to share with you the experience of a good friend of mine.

Three years ago, I visited Quito, Ecuador and in a trendy coffee shop I was reunited with a friend from school. We had been classmates in the fourth grade. Her name is Marisol and she had been a high school teacher, but now she is the coffee shop owner. This was a very emotional meeting and we spoke for hours catching up with our lives.

We attended a Catholic school but she is liberal in her beliefs. In fact, she is a divorced and remarried.

When I told Marisol I was living in Chile, she said to me that she had been ‘reborn’ in Chile, and told me the following story that happened to her in 2002.

Marisol was forty two when she came to Chile to visit her son who was studying in Santiago. She was staying at a hotel along with her husband and youngest daughter. The previous day she had been visiting the city of Santiago and just the day before the accident she had been window shopping. On the day of the accident, she was going to start buying a few presents to take back home. It was still early that morning when she got into the shower. She planned to wash her hair but couldn't find the shampoo. She realized that the shampoo bottle was over the sink and stretched her wet arm to reach it. There was a wall lamp in the way. Chile has two hundred twenty volts in the electrical current. Obviously, there was an electrical problem with the lamp and she electrocuted herself. Her husband had tried to get her out of the bathtub but he received an electrical discharge that made him hit the wall. Fortunately, he was not seriously hurt, so he managed to wrap her with the bathroom curtain and pulled her out of the bathroom. Her heart had stopped. While all this was going on inside the bathroom, the daughter rushed to the lobby and called for help. Several minutes later, an ambulance arrived and Marisol received cardiopulmonary resuscitation but did not regain consciousness until she arrived to the hospital’s emergency room.

She recalls everything turning black. Then she felt as if she was going very fast through some sort of a tunnel and was able to see everything that had happened the previous days. In the whirlpool, she even saw the things she wanted to buy. She felt bewildered at first. Then she saw herself on the floor, very pale and her frantic husband kneeling next to her trying to resuscitate her. When her daughter walked in crying, Marisol felt sorry for them. When the paramedics arrived, she watched how the resuscitation was applied and how she was taken into the ambulance. She felt very calm and at peace. While she was inside the ambulance, she realized it was going to be too difficult for her husband to raise their daughter by himself. He would have to leave his job to manage the coffee shop. Her daughter was still very young and needed guidance. After all these thoughts, she decided that she could not leave yet. She woke up in the emergency room.

Now, she said, she is not afraid of dying. In fact, dying is beautiful, she added.
