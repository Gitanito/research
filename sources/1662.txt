I can make you for the honour you dome

Firft, That allthe Difeafes and diftempers MrOr-

in the particular Temperament of the parts* of the

Secondly, That of the Difeafes andInfirmitieswhich
fie meddles with, he Cures none wherein there is ade­
cay inNature, but onely fuch as whereinflaefeemsonly
opprefled by fome Heterogeneous Ferment,either ex­
citing anEbullition and palne, orC oagulacing andfix­

fon for inward diftempersas to their caufes,his filling
astomany* andthe relapfe of many after a momencany
amendment is to beafcribedto thiscauffr: as I ihali
fhewfurther by and by.

goor and ftrength which Is natufallto them and refuf-
Citate the contracted imbeciilicy of any part. That
which makes me to conceive this,is, that I obferve that
thereare things outwardly applyed which by their op-
pofition to particular Ferments do deftroy feverall
Djftempers, not onely inwardly taken# blit outwardly
applyed: as the Cramp rings and fmall M&'nAti-ftene

needs no IlltiftratiOn. Having thefe grounds to con­
firme me in the manner Medicaments may Operate#
methinks I can as.eafily comprehend that there may
be a Medicament (and whether that be a Manj or a
Stone, or a Plant, itis all one ) which mSy invigorate
the blood and fpirits foas to continue that Work of
Circnlating, depurating, and Sanguifying, as beforO

God,orfuch as he hath Obligedin amore eminent man*

to explicate the wayes and means whereby thole Amur
lets work; the notion I have concerning MrGrcAtarich
is the moil facile» for Iimagine no more to be in him,
then aparticular Temperament,or implanted Ferment,
which upon histouching and Broking fhall fofarre in­
vigorate the blood, fpirits, and innate temperament of
the part (Nature being onely oppreffed) that they per,
forme their uOiall duties: This being done, it.is Nature
Cures the Difeafes and diftempers and infirmities, it
is Mature makes them fly up and down the Body fo as
they do: they avoyd not his Hand, but hisTouch and
Broke fo Invigorateth the parts that they rejed the
Heterogeneous Ferment, 'till it be outed the Body at
fome of thofe parts he is thought to Broke it out at.
Confidering that our yfe is but a Fermentation of
the Blood, nervous Liquor, and innate conBitution of J
the parrs of our Body, I conceive I have reprefented '
thofe hints and proofs which may render it imaginable
that Mr Greataricks b
y his ftroking may introduce an
oppreffed Fermentation into the Blood and Nerves,
and refufcitate the oppreffed Nature of the parts. I f
now proceed to fhew that thofe effects which are fo ad-1
mired, upon the ftroaking of MrGreataricks Hand,^k: 3
that the paines flye before his Hand, untill fie drive I
them out at theFingers, Mouth, feyes, Toes, &c. are *
the effe&s of Nature invigorated, andnot immediatly |
of his Touching. ?
: 'I faw him Stroke a man for agreat and fetled paine
inhis left Shoulder, which rendered his Arme ufeleffe:
upon his ftroking it the paine removed inftantly into
the end of the mufcolus Deltodes : being Stroked
thereat returned to the Shoulder again: thence (upon
afecondStroking) it flew to the Elbow, thence to his
Wrift, thence to his Shoulder again; and thence to his
Fingers^ whence it went out upon his laft ftroking, fo
as that he moved bis Arme vigoroufly every way. I
asked MrGreaterick about the C ourfes, pains, anddi-
feafes took, to go out of the Body: he told me, he
could not tell vvhat courfe any pain or Difeafe would
take to go out : that thewayesof God were unfearch-
able: that, it was not in1iis power to force them any
way, but that he followed them onely, andif the party
could not tell where the paine was ( for fuch are onely
ftroked out) he could not cure them* nor were they
cured, buteafedifitcamenot out. O f this l faw an
inftanceina Woman, whom the Falling- (icknefle by
its long continuance (joyn’d with Melancholly) had in­
fatuated fo3s that being out ofall Fits, fhe could not
tell what ayled her : fhe falling into her Fit there, he
opened her Breaft and with afew ftrokes reduced her
to her fell, but (he not being able to tell what was be*

cianany man be ignorant ofthe tranflations of Humours
andpaines from noble to ignoble parts, and from ig­
noble to nobleones, nor of the alteration of diftem-
pers upon fuch tranflation of the Morbifiqae Matter,
as of Afthmas and Coughs .turning to the Gout, or
Tumour of the Tefticles: of Agnes turning intd pains
in the Joynts 5 of Feavours ending in a Parptis, or
other abfceffus. Not to mention the vagrant nature
of Humours in the beginuing of Difeafes, when they
are Turgent , and continually vary their ftation.
Thefe Coofiderations made me think that God had
been pleated to bellow upon M fuch a
Complexion and Temperament, that; his Touch or
Stroking fbould inftantly maturate Difeafes, or render
them Turgent, whereupon the part touched being
flrengtbned, and the blood and (pints jfnvigorated,

cafioned by fome evident and externall caufe, is caus'd
by an Heterogeneous Ferment) is- expelled from the
corroborated place to feme other more weake: that
being corroborated, in s driven upon another, and fo

There
There reraaincyet two thingsto be debated, viz:
1. How comes itto pafte that thefe Heterogene*
. Otis Ferments removing thus by the force of Refuf-
. citated Nature, do not terminate in Apoftemes,
of iffue out infome grofl'e Body; but go out in a
vapour andinvifibly ?
2. How comes all this to happen in fo fhort a
- time?
T o the firft I anfwer $ That it is not unufuall for Na­
ture to difeharge her felf of Heterogeneous Ferments
by infenfible Tranfpiration * as well as Apoftemes,
Sweat, Diarrhaea, and Urine: fo the Mefels arecored:
fo many Crude andhard Tumours:: and in this Plague
few fvvellings broke, yet were they cured. Nor is it to
be (aid, that the matteroccafioningthofe T umours was
difeuffed fo as to be reimbibed intbe blood againe: for
in the Plague the recurfesofthe Peftilentiall Ferment
areMortall: and fuch as took Powders and Antidotes
gently promoting a Diaphorefis, (not fweatj efcapcd:
they who did not, dyed with thofe Bubones. It is
aneffe<ftof prejudice occafioned by the contemplati­
on of the ufuall effeds of Nature » and not of Rea-
fon, to imagine that the Morbifique caufe confifts ina
grofle Body, becaufe it is often evacuated fo*' Itis
ufuall for thofe fubtileFerments fo to commix them-
felves, and to occafion that tranfpofition of Parts and
Texture, that Naturecannot eje& the one without the
expenfe ofthe other. Thus wefee that Beer or Ale in
its Fermentation or Working cafts out ahoundance of
Barme,yet isnot that Body the Ferment,but it isimpli­
cated and incorporated ^herewith, for with ic there

Allome, there is not the like diminution. So Ktrgtrus
faith,that in Germanythey put common Salt, or cold
Water into their Bear, and precipitating the Ferment
make it potable prefently. Many fucn inftances are
to befound in Dr VViRit and Kw
hich fufficien
evince that the Ferment is diftinft from the grofle
Body it comes out in. So in Difeafes, however fome
have vainly imagined to themfelves a maturation of
themi and that the Morbifique matter being conco&ed
iflucd out in that white Hypoftafis at the end of Di-
feafes; yet is it no fuch thing, nor is there any fuch con*
cotfion in Nature as they phanfy: but the Morbifique
matter or Ferment, being intimately commixed with
fome good and profitable parts of the Blood and Hu­
mours, is eje&ed together with them, according to the
nature of the Eumu&ory, by which the Crifis or Me*
taflaiis is made, or the nature ofthe Bodies constituting
that humour. Nature dealing therein juft as (he does

wayes of curing Agues by Precipitation of the Morbi­

to b£doubted I chink that all grofle bodyed Ferments
have their Virtue and efficacy from a fubtile Body
which is no more inthat grofle Body, then the Spirit
of Sugar is in Sugar: of which See \^dngelus Salas
SucburologU: many other inftances might be given,
as that, if the grand Eerment were agrofle Body, how
comes it to evaporate (as I have feen in the Diftiilati-
on of Sugar, Sugar-cande-juyce, and other Liquors
Fermented for Spirits) without any diminutionof the
Liquors ? From all which it appears that one may
conceivehow upontheefficaciousToach of Mr

ment, the Morbifiqne Ferment may be ejected-, and
the remaining grofle Body^by a Tranfpofition ofits
Texture andanew impregnation of Vitality be reim­
bibed into the Blood, and become nutritious.' Thus
he cures Afthmas, all the obftru&ions from impa&ed
phlegme in the Lungs being difeharged, and the
phlegme Naturalifed. But it the grofle body of the

the one is driven out, the other may remainc in the
Body, and by unloosing the Texture of the Body of
the blood, andother Humours, give opportunity for

pofliblc that where the Morbifique Ferment is not fuf-

Mr Bromley %
brother of Upton upon Severne after
a long Quartanc Ague had by a Metadata of the Di-
feafe foch a chilnefTe in the habit of the Body, that
no Clothes could poffibly warme him: he wore upon
hisHead many fpiced Caps, and tenne pounds weight
of Linnen on his Head: Mr dripped him,
and robbed him all over, and immediatly he fweat,
andwas hot all over, fo as that the Bath never heated
up as did the Hand of Ml Grentericks: this was his
own expreflion. But Ml Grestarted caufing him to
cad offall that multitude of C aps and Clothes *
, it was
foppofed that it frudrated the happy effedf; for he
felt the recourfe of his Difeafe in fome partsrendered
the Care fufpicious. But as often as M
<
cameand rubbed him he would be all in a dame againe
for half an hour: the Experiment whereof was fre­
quently pradis'd for five or fix da- es at Bagly.

preffing upon him for help.
