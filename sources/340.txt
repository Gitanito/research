Hull restarted the journal under the title The New Thought in Chicago in 1892.  LOC.

  On Hull, see the notes under Hull's Crucible.  He had ceased publishing the predecessor to this journal (New Thought 1885) in 1889, selling the subscription list to the Better Way and the type to Summerland, only to realize, he said, how beloved and necessary the journal was to spiritualists, which induced him to start the present journal.  It consisted largely of articles by Hull that had originally been delivered as "sermons" and talks on the lecture tour ("The Spiritual Alps and How to Ascend Them"), supplemented with regular contributions by the second of the two "Ms," his wife Mattie, and various unknowns like Laura M. Heath, U.G. Figley, and Alice Lyndsay Lynch.  It featured irregularly short biographies of leading figures like Nettie Coleman Maynard, Julia H. Severance and John Brown, complete with photographs.  The journal carried Hull's exchange of letters with Hazlett Park spiritualist camp in which he attempted to explain away (unsuccessfully) his incautious statements on practicing "free love" 20 years before.  It was in the forefront of the move from old-fashioned spiritualism, focused on the "spirits" of the dead, to "higher spiritualism," which was focused on the spirit within man here and now and on the development of man's innate spiritual possibilities.
