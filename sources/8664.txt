  I'm not sure why I feel compelled to share my story. I was impressed with the   stories I read on your site. I have always wondered about my relationship with   my soul mate. We are a little different because we were young when we met on our   school bus. I was thirteen and he was fifteen. We rode that bus together for a   few years and as we grew older our relationship grew deeper. But, what felt so   natural to us was often challenged by others. We never dated seriously because   we just &quot;couldn't get it right&quot;. One or the other of us was either with someone   else or when we did try dating it didn't &quot;feel right&quot;.

  After high school we went our separate   ways; him to a career in the Army and I off to college. We kept in touch closely   for the first year and half but were forced to sever our ties because his new   bride was unable to understand our connection. I had never felt pain so deep or   agonizing.

  During the years we were out of touch a   I had a dream about him having a daughter. After speaking with his mother it was   confirmed his wife had birthed a baby girl just days before me dream. I would   never have known had it not been for the dream. I always found that occurrence   to have been incredible. We have had similar experience in the years since as   well. But, it wasn't until three years later when I was preparing to marry that   we spoke again. He called me to congratulate me on my marriage.

  We kept in touch from that point on and   finally saw each other again eight years after our graduation from high school.   When I picked him up at the airport we only had 28 hours to visit. It was   incredible! There was no awkwardness or weirdness. We had an awesome time. This   past March we got to visit again. He had been in Iraq for two years and came   home to visit his family. He stayed with my husband and I for 3 days. Again we   had an incredible visit. This time we delved into the &quot;forbidden&quot; territory. We   discussed our feelings: when we're together, when we're apart, and throughout   the past several years. I am fortunate to have a husband who is secure in my   relationship with my best friend. Unfortunately, my friend's wife left him. 
  
  I will be traveling to Germany next week to visit my friend. I have always felt   like he was my soul mate, but I also felt I was cheating my husband by saying   that about someone else. I thought it was terrific to read the other stories on   your site. I know my soul mate and I will probably never marry or have children   together, but the connection we have is so much more than most people could ever   understand. He completes me.
