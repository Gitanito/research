This volume is a serious attempt to make plain the
puzzling references in the Bible, relating to the
Second Coming of our Lord. The chaotic world
conditions of today are rapidly drawing these old
prophesies into the sharp focus of positive recognition.

I consider it a privilege and an honor, to be able to present this little
volume to your attention. Nothing in all my experience has thrilled me
so much as the reading, printing and presenting of this volume to you.
I read part of the manuscript in 1933, and for eight years have pleaded
work out until the first part of this year, although all through those eight
years I knew that I would have the pleasure of publishing it.
This material seemed to be a climax to nearly forty years of study
not just another book, it’s a rough sketch or map of the immediate fu­
ture; the skeleton framework, as it were. Such being the case, it will be
a valuable aid to all who read it; but more especially to those who are
spiritually awakened, for they will see, and receive, from the reading,
infinitely more than the intellectualist, for it is still true that spiritual
things must be spiritually perceived.
To the materialist, it will be a source of irritation, in most cases; so the
degree of help and enlightenment you receive from this book is the
degree of your own spiritual enfoldment. Those bom around 1884, 1885
and. 1886, with Neptune trine to Uranus, have a rather keen intuition,
and intuition is a spiritual faculty. It’s the part of you that knows; not
the knowledge of the head, but the knowledge of the soul.
Don’t take too literally the time element, time doesn’t exist on the oth­
er planes; although I believe that in the rough the time given is approx­
imately correct.
The beauty of these prophecies is that they should appeal to all stu­
dents of prophecy, and more especially to the Bible student, for the
Biblical Appendix definitely ties it up with your Christian Bible, and
they cannot deny these prophecies without repudiating their Bible. Some
Bible students, however, think that the law of spiritual manifestation
ceased when the Bible was written. As a matter of fact, the channels
have always been open; right down through the ages we have had proph­
ets and seers, holding aloft the searchlight of truth, guiding, directing
and warning humanity as the occasion arose. God always had His mes­
sengers, and in times of emergency, like the present, the number in­
creases considerably; and that is what one would expect from a God of
Love, ever striving to throw a protecting arm around His children, to
those who will listen.
with the editor to allow me to publish it. Somehow the thing didn’t
along these lines; then again it fills a need of humanity today. This is
3
Before going to press, there was an interesting sequel; for the style
of the book, the color of the cover, and the picture of the Christ, were
selected and approved by the individual who gave the material in the
Prophecy letters. I know, because I was privileged to be the channel
through which this approval was given. At the same time, I was as­
sured that the book would be a success, and a blessing to the world.
If you are blessed by the reading of this book, won’t you please share
that blessing with others? For while the message is startling in its na­
ture, yet it gives a note of assurance and peace; that God is in His
heaven, and that everything is working out according to law and order;
that He, through the elements, is tearing down the old crystallization,
the accumulation of the Pisces Age of the past two thousand years. Then
again there is positive assurance of the coming of the Messiah, to set up
the Kingdom of God on earth; and in this volume you will find the
rough sketch of the New Order.
Many will claim that they are going to set up this new order. Don’t
be led astray, no matter how sincere they may appear to be; only the
Master can establish the Kingdom of God on earth. And if we have
trained and prepared ourselves, we may be privileged to work under
His direction— but not to lead. So keep away from man-made organiza­
tions, and prepare yourselves spiritually for the Day that will soon
be here.
Many will ask, “What must I do, to prepare myself for service when
the Master sets up the Kingdom of God on earth?” Well, that’s simple;
by putting in a little practice, in service now. That’s the only way you
will be ready. You will find the spirit of service outlined in the 13th
chapter of I Corinthians. Repeatedly Jesus emphasized the value of ser­
vice: “Peter, lovest thou me?” “Yea, Lord.” “Feed my lambs.” Service is
the essence of love; we grow by self denial.
But don’t be a metaphysical ostrich: “Let him who is greatest among
you be the servant of all.” And James tells us, “For as the body without
the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”
The world is full of leaders it doesn’t need; it needs people with the
spirit of service; and as the old order comes crashing down, through war,
internal eruption, earthquakes and tidal waves, rejoice; for it indicates
that your redemption draweth nigh; the Day is here.
Watch and pray, unceasingly.

The matter contained in this book will, no doubt, appear as “foolish­
ness” to many of our ultra-sophisticated and hard-boiled citizenry, who
have overlaid their spiritual integrity with the lethal pleasures of mater­
ial ease and worldliness. To those having an awakened spiritual con­
sciousness, however, this book will prove to be a most wonderful source
of illumination upon the affairs and conditions of mankind, during the
next decade, and beyond to the half-century mark, which is the period
covered, for the most part, by these Prophecy Letters.
The communicator is Emlitta King, a woman of great spiritual power
and illumination, who passed into the Spirit World, on September 4,
1932. The remarkable spiritual affinity co-existing between her and her
husband, alone, made it possible for her to record the events in the
Cosmic Matrix, about to come into material objectification. The facts set
forth were delivered to her, by “illuminated beings close to the Source
of Truth”, to be written into a material record, in order, as she says, in
the closing sentence of her last letter, on January 19th, 1933, —
“That all
may have warning, and inspiration and courage to face the future.”
These letters were received through the medium of automatic writing,
through the hand of her husband, and have been set down exactly as
given, without change of any kind, except the elimination of a few
personal terms of endearment, which have no bearing upon the record,
but which are highly evidential, as to her identity.
There are, in all, fifteen letters, received on consecutive nights; com­
mencing with January 2nd, 1933, and ending with January 19th, there
being a lapse of two nights when nothing was received. The letters have
been carefully reproduced in wording exactly as given. The style of pre­
sentation, however, in which they are offered to the reader, was adopt­
ed in order that the more important items could be easily read and re­
ferred to by any who are desirous of studying the prophecies with the
Bible as authoritative reference.
A very careful reference to the Bible and the reproduction of all im­
portant matter contained herein, bearing upon the “time of the end”,
5
spoken of so often by the inspired Prophets of old, from Isaiah to Mala-
chi; by our Lord, Himself; by the Apostles and writers of the New i'est-
ament—
makes clear that the time of the Great Tribulation, ot world
cataclysms, and of our Lord’s Second Coming, is right at hand.
The numbers appearing in the text of the Prophetical Letters, cor­
respond to numbered paragraphs in the Biblical Appendix, thus making
it a simple and most convenient form of study and confirmation.
I have, personally, verified the statements made in the Prophecy Let­
ters, with corresponding extracts from the Bible. I believe absolutely
in the identity of their author. I have known the communicator, person­
ally, in life, and there can be no question of her mental, moral and spir­
itual integrity.
Therefore, I believe her letters to be of the utmost importance to the
world at this time, and offer them to the public in a frame of mind
sobered by the seriousness of the things that are “coming upon the earth
in the latter days.”
As I look out upon the confusion, fear and tremendous conflict ot na­
tional interests; upon the isolation of nations by selfish laws; upon the in­
justice and insane scramble for power; the hoarding of gold; upon the
greed and hypocrisy prevailing throughout the whole world at present,
—
I am thoroughly convinced that the “time of the end”, as described
in the Book of Daniel, in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, and,
as stated by our Lord, Himself,—
is right upon us.
Many of the inspired writers of the Old and New Testaments were
especially empowered to look ahead to this present time. They all most
accurately record the conditions of blind confusion, the hypocrisy, the
convulsions of nature, the running after false gods, the universal strain,
distress, suspicion, jealousy, famine, war, intrigue, defiance and distrust
between nations and among the inhabitants of the world. These con­
ditions are NOW clearly visible on every hand.
I am thoroughly convinced as I look out upon all these things, that
a serious acceptance of all that is given in the following pages is inev­
itable to all sane, sincere, sober, thinking, reverent men and women
throughout the world.
It will, no doubt, be asserted by many who will study the Biblical ref­
erences to the Second Coming of our Lord, that the prophecies .of Isaiah,
and those following him, concerning the destruction so vividly and re­
peatedly emphasized—
applies to the time immediately centering around
those inspired servants of the Most High. They can point truthfully and
6
with impressive verification to the fact that the Jewish Race of that time
was especially designated for chastisement by an indignant God, and
they can show that the punishment WAS visited upon the world and
the peoples in those days, exactly as stated by those inspired ones who
knew in advance and issued innumerable warnings that were not heeded.
All this is admitted in advance. But the visions of the Prophets of
old not only foresaw, closer up, those hypocrisies for which punishment
was immediately in store—
they were also permitted to glimpse the TIME
OF THE END, and they described the conditions as they shall be “in
the latter days,” exactly as we find them to be today.
If God’s Chosen People were not spared for their iniquities) in the
time of Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or any of their successors—
we may be very
sure and certain that everything with the soil of evil clinging to it in
these times, when the chastisement takes place, as related in the Proph­
ecy letters,—
will, likewise, be fully and completely and utterly fulfilled.
The Bible is saturated with TRUTH. Sometimes it is uncovered and
plain to be seen. Sometimes it is hidden in prophecy, or illustrated in
parable. The TRUTH about the Second Coming, and the state of the
world at the “timeiof the end” is just as clear, unmistakable, unescap-
able and compelling, even though we are caused to search for it, and
do our own thinking and form our own conclusions.
The prophecies of Isaiah and his successors are almost invariably
“double-barreled.” They warn of great calamities that are soon to over­
take a stubborn and rebellious people. They also reach far out beyond
the close-up punishment into the future, right to our present day and
show, in clear, emphatic and unmistakable language, what shall happen
to the great image of Civilization of which Nebuchadnezzar, the great
king of ancient Babylon, was the HEAD OF GOLD. Our present highly
“intellectual” and educated, but thoroughly rotten and unsound “civili­
zation”—
the MODERN BABYLON,—
the “feet of clay” shall be smashed,
by the fall of the GREAT ROCK, and utterly broken in pieces.
Read the Prophecy Letters with an open mind. Study the Biblical
references to the “time of the end” and the Second Coming of our Lord.
Meditate upon the conditions under which we live at present. Search
for the TRUTH. Do your own thinking and when you have found the
truth, the truth shall make you free. Do not permit ridicule to prevent
your seeking. For it is written: “Ask, and ye SHALL receive. Seek, and
ye SHALL find. Knock, and it SHALL be opened unto you.” This is a
matter of most serious; personal concern in a desperate world. Form
7
your own conclusions after you have read all the evidence. DO YOUR
OWN THINKING.
Pray for ability to see the truth. Pray for courage to acknowledge the
truth'after you have seen it. Then pray for wisdom to ACT UPON IT,
after you have accepted it. By so doing, you will be fore-warned and
prepared.
De Witt B. Lucas
The numbers in the text refer to similiarly numbered sections in the Bibli­
cal Appendix, following these Prophecy Letters. The matter so identified in the
body of the letters, refers to the same thing in the Bible, which the Prophets
of old foresaw
The ‘ time of the end” has been a theme running through every p-cphet-c
record from Isaiah to Revelation. Like a golden thread this “Time of the Fnd”
runs continuously through each Prophetic period, and is taken up by *he suc­
ceeding “Representative” of God, and repeated and emphasized. Not only con­
cerning the destruction to take place, but applying to the “new world” and nar-
velous conditions of Brother Love that would obtain in the world after the New
Dispensation has been established.
It has been only during the past 25 years that many of the prophecies could
be recognized and understood, because the conditions in the world had not yet
assembled themselves into a “ focal point” of well-defined clearness. Therefore
it has been impossible to understand them.
After the Prophecy Letters were delivered and completed I, personally, took
the Bible and went through it “with a fine-tooth comb” from Isaiah to Reve­
lation, trying to DISPROVE the things given therein, but I was unable to dis­
prove them, instead finding many things to CONFIRM AND EMPHASIZE THEM.
Readers of the book who encounter a series of numbers such as that in
the First Letter (6-19-31-34-36-37-38-52) can readily turn to the appendix fol­
lowing the letters and read exactly what the various Prophets had to say on this
same theme a long time ago. Or, the Appendix itself, containing ALL of the
prophets’ writing pertaining to the “Time of the End” can be read without
troubling to open their Bibles.

PART I
L etters of Prophecy
THE FIRST LETTER
It is such a comfort to me to be again touching your consciousness in
this direct, loving and intimate manner, without the necessity of any
“medium” to work through. I am so thankful I have to tell you about
it, my darling, every time I take your pen in hand.
And now, I wish to start the record of those very remarkable, inter­
esting and almost unbelievable things, happenings and occurences, that
have been given to me, by very advanced spiritual entities who are
closer to the Source, than any I have ever met before, —to record in this
way for your own personal information and that of anyone you may wish
to share them with.
First, I want to assure you that what I am to tell you from night to
night is absolutely true. You know your very own beloved would never
deceive you in the slightest, nor will I deceive you in any of those, to
me, most astounding and world-breaking facts that will re-make mankind
and civilizations on this planet, during the next fifty years.
I shall try to set down the record in proper chronological sequence,
although I mav forget some things and insert them later, but with your
loose-leaf system, you can always readily insert the fact just where it
belongs.
During the troublous times to come, I will still be your very own
wife, your comrade, companion, counsellor and informant. It will be a
marvelous thing to work with you, my darling; so wonderful I can hard­
ly believe the truth of my own good fortune. But in this, I have been
definitely assured that I was taken from your side, my dearest one, for
this very work. So, nothing ever happens by chance in either world,
my darling. It was ordained that we meet just when we did, and part

just when and as we did. At is a wonderful thing to see the working of
the Providence of God, from this side of life.
And now Daddy dear, I have to start the series of facts composing
this record, by setting down those close-up things that are just now
emerging from the Cosmic Matrix, in accordance with God’s Plan for the
salvation of the world under Christ’s rule.
OUR SAVIOUR IS TO COME TO EARTH AGAIN IN THE
PHYSICAL VEHICLE INSIDE OF TEN YEARS. He will come in
clouds and great glory, just as is recorded in the Bible. He will have His
Disciples with Him, and will rule the world in equity and brotherly-love
and justice after the great cataclysm THAT W ILL DESTROY NEARLY
ALL OF THE PRESENT CIVILIZATION has taken place. These cata­
clysms are now rapidly taking place in the world. (0-19-31-34-36-37-
38-52).
1 HE UNIVERSAL POVERTY IN THE MIDST OF GREAT ABUN­
DANCE: the hoarding of gold; the secret agreements among the states­
men of the world; the great floods and famines; the secret preparations
for WAR, bv every nation under the sun and the UNIVERSAL GREED
AND RUNNING AFTER FALSE GODS,-all of which are clearly set
forth in the Bible, will in the very near future come to an acute state
that will engender universal suspicion and hatred. (2-5-7-14-23-25-29-
35).
THIS W ILL BRING ABOUT THE GREATEST AND LAST WAR,
in which whole cities will be completely wiped out by poisonous gas
and other horrible methods of destruction. And now, I will close this
introduction. I hope you will let me set down regularly for the nexxt
three or four weeks, what has been given to me to pass on to you.
> 0 0 0 0 ^ 0 0r=%^f» r ^ < 0r ^ a 0r ^ e &
THE SECOND LETTER
It is again my rare privilege to set down the continuance of the pro­
phetic matter which has been given to me to give to you, and which I
am so proud and eager to do and also very thankful you permit us to
do so and co-operate in making a permanent record.
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN ME, LIKE A MOVING PICTURE OF THE
FUTURE, about to be released soon, that the relations of the different
Governments of the world are to .become more and more strained and
intolerable. (14)
THE CULMINATION W ILL TAKE PLACE ABOUT 1940 or 1941,
when a great conflagration will flare up, and war will be declared by
one nation upon another, and the whole world will become entirely insane
and bereft of any sense, pity, reason or mercy. There will be a whole­
sale killing of people; not only military armies, but innocent men, women
and children. There will be great destruction of life and property. A mad­
ness shall seize upon all but a few, who will be chosen of the Lord, to
start a new dispensation after the chaos has been ended.
THERE ARE MANY SIGNS OF SECRET ENEMIES ALREADY IN
ALL COUNTRIES, spying upon one another, and gathering information
as to points of vulnerability. ALREADY CHINA AND JAPAN ARE
FIGHTING, and it is going to be worse. It will probably be the spark
that will eventually become the roaring flame of war. (19-31-34)
THE UNITED STATES W ILL NOT BE DRAWN INTO IT A T
FIRST, but it will eventually enter the holocaust and will force con­
ditions that will bring an end to the fighting; but not until after great
destruction of life and property, and many coast cities, such as New
York and Boston and Savannah, and many others have, been completely
destroyed, with their inhabitants.
ONLY A FEW CAN POSSIBLY ESCAPE FROM THE POISON
GAS BOMBS that will be dropped down upon them. The cities in the in-
11
12 T hy Kingdom C ome
terior will not be destroyed and CHICAGO W ILL LIKELY BECOME
THE CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES FOR A TIME.
THERE ARE BEING BUILT MANY SUBMARINES OF ENOR­
MOUS SIZE that will carry aeroplanes and release them to fly over
coastal cities and drop the poison bombs at night; but they will event­
ually be driven away by the Naval vessels and our own air corps.
THESE THINGS W ILL COMMENCE TO COME TO PASS IN
ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN YEARS, and the fighting will last three years
and the whole world will be in the cauldron. BUT THE UNITED
STATES AND ENGLAND AND CANADA W ILL WIN, AND STAND
TOGETHER, for it has been ordained that the English speaking people
shall start the new civilization founded upon brotherly love and equity
and justice.
I HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT OUR LORD IS TO COME TO
EARTH within twelve years. Probably at the end of the awful war,
when only comparatively a handful of the people remain, and who will
pray to our Father for peace and preservation and mercy; and that then,
with the advent of our Saviour, in His body, the second time, He will
make all things new, and a new civilization will be started at once, in
which evil cannot exist for a THOUSAND YEARS. (33-39-47-48-49-
51-56).
And now, my precious husband, I will soon bring this letter to a close-
I am tired with the great effort to gather this information in the spiritual
matrix and record it in the material medium- I am only giving you what
I have received from advanced beings who are close to The Great Source.
All I ask you to do, is to permit this record to be made and stand for
future verification. I will try to get specific events that are to occur and
record them in future letters.
I expect to have most of the work written into the record before the
end of this month, if you are able to cooperate with us every night.
Believe the facts as given. They are True.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE THIRD LETTER
I am glad you are earlier on the job tonight, for I have been trying
to gather my facts all day and*prepare them into the best possible se­
quence for recording. First, my dearest one, let my tell you of my un­
dying love land how greatly I am privileged to talk to you direct, this
way, and how happy I am that you are willing to take down and preserve
the facts I shall disclose tonight iand other nights to come. For this let­
ter, I wish to set forth some startling and outstanding events to take
place in the first'ten year period.
AFTER THE GREAT WAR STARTS there will be great earthquakes
and violent storms on sea and land; just asjis recorded in the Book of
Revelation. Whole cities will be destroyed and nationalities will be de­
stroyed or wiped) out. It will be a time of great stress, and every one in
the world will suffer greatly, except those who have been chosen by Our
Lord, who are to be preserved and protected )(3-6-9-20-22-23-26-30-45-
53-57).
I HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT GREAT LAND AREAS /ARE TO
DISAPPEAR and new continents will come up out of the sea; and great
tidal waves shall /sweep all around the world with great destruction and
loss of life, just as is related in Revelation.
Then, when the fighting all over the world is at its height, there will
come a GREAT ROCK out of the dark reaches of the sky, and it will
smite the earth a mighty blow, just tohere the fighting is the most dread­
ful, and great armies will be destrom d in the twinkling of an cue. (17-
18-26-30-53-55).
IT IS THE GREAT iROCK, PROPHESIED IN THE BOOK OF DAN­
IEL, that smites the feet of the Great Image and brings about the fall of
modern civilization. It will be /
a great piece of some other world, AS
LARGE AS RHODE ISLAND, and large enough to be seen for some
days in the telescopes of the world. |
Its coming will be predicted and
13
14 T hy Kingdom Com e
great excitement will prevail for several days. People will die of terror
and fright, and great will be the distress and fear among all peoples.
IT WILL STRIKE EUROPE, AND DESTROY NEARLY EVERY
LIVING THING IN THE OLD WORLD. After it hits, all fighting will
cease and great quiet and mourning will take place, and a universal
prayer!will be offered up by all the people who remain alive, for the
Lord to come. Then will the Son of Man appear in the clouds in power
and great glory, and immediately will the great/work of reconstruction
begin. (30-37-40-43-44-46-50).
THE EARTH WILL BE DRIVEN A LITTLE OUT OF ITS ORBIT,
a little closer to the Sun. Great climatic changes will take place, making
the Northern and Southern hemispheres almost temperate, and bringing
about a wonderful growth of vegetation that will benefit mankind. I
think the Great Rock will smite the earth close to the end of the eighth
year from now. (This would be in 1942 or 1943.—
D. B. L .) (11-27-44-46)
I said (in a previous letter) the war would commence “and continue
for three years.” Therefore, the great piece of planet should strike to­
ward the end of the three-year period, in 1942 or 1943. IT IS VERY
HARD FOR US TO TELL. But remember, when the war is at its most
desperate and furious point, the great catastrophe will .appear in the
heavens. There “shall be signs in the heavens” the Bible says, and this
surely will be/one of them- (31).
I am tired tonight, my precious husband, for it is a great emotional
strain upon us to have to see and record such terrible things. It, depletes
our spiritual forces and we have to rest. I want to say, before I bid you
a fond goodnight, my precious one, that fantastic as all this appears
to you, it is absolutely true and will come into fulfillment during the
next ten or fifteen years.
THERE WILL BE A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH
BROUGHT INTO BEING and people will be industrious, happy, hon­
orable and loving. THERE IS TO BE A GREAT CIVILIZATION ARISE
OUT OF THE DESTRUCTION, and the Lord of Hosts will be the
King, and all things will be made new and clean and fresh. (12-17-46).
THE WORLD W ILL BEGIN TO BLOSSOM WITH GREATEST
ABUNDANCE; and science, and art, and literature, and mechanics will
produce undreamed of wonders. Life will be good, and people will live
to be very old, and all will know about the spirit-life and death will not
be feared, but rather a cause for rejoicing. Eventually, death will not
L etters of Prophecy 15
take place unless it is caused by some accident, and then it will not be
feared.
NEW SOULS W ILL BE BORN INTO THE WORLD THAT W ILL
FUNCTION LARGELY ON BOTH PLANES, and many other wonders
of the Spirit World will be brought down to earth, and a NEW RACE
OF SUPER-MEN OR BEINGS begun during the next hundred years.
(11-12-13).
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.
Additional Note regarding the Second Coming,
Shown in the Pyramid Calculations
The Bible clearly states and emphasizes the fact that the Son of Man Com­
eth NOT with observation. Hence, the influence of the COMING PRESENCE
may be indicated in this important Pyramid Date.
It is certainly a fact that on or about September 14-15, 1936, there has been
a decided aggressivenss in the Forces of Destruction and Evil, which is almost
as though they had perceived the “Power of Opposition” coming into focus
throughout the world and had, themselves, gone into greater effort to bring about
the utter confusion of peoples and increase the hatred, defiance and autocratic
domination of nations and individuals.
So it may be that the Pyramid Date DOES bear a most significant place in
the “end time” as the BEGINNING OF THE MARSHALLING OF THE FORCES
OF HEAVEN TO COMBAT THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL MANKIND THAT
SEEMS CLEARLY EVIDENT TODAY.
The markings of the Great Pyramid, the various dates shown, and accurate
synchronizing of important events WITH those dates, would seem to make it
very clear and unmistakeable, that SOME GREAT MOMENT had arrived, and
that lines of force would proceed therefrom, that would eventually accrue to the
benefit of the human race on this planet.

THE FOURTH LETTER
Again I have the great joy of contacting you direct—
a modern miracle
if there ever was one, for I can talk to you, my precious one, from the
spirit side of life, something very few are able to do directly—
I mean
husband and wife—
without the aid of a medium, and then only at long
intervals. I am so grateful and thankful to our Heavenly Father, and
never quite get over the wonder of it all.
And now, my precious one, I have come with a being who will tell or
show to me those events that will be outstanding in the next decade, and
shall faithfully set them down.
CHRIST W ILL COME IN ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS.
CHRIST WILL BRING THE TWELVE APOSTLES WITH HIM
and they will set up a new government, and the Twelve will be the
judges of humanity and decide all important matters. The people of the
earth will become as one large family in which there is perfect harmony,
co-operation and love. (21).
THERE W ILL BE REMNANTS PRESERVED OF ALL THE ART­
ISANS, and the Arts will be developed for the benefit of all mankind
alike, without regard to race or color.
THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE RELIGION, for the knowledge of
the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea; and no one
shall say to his brother “Knowest thou the Lord?”—
for all shall know him,
AND SHALL BOW DOWN BEFORE HIM, (27-30-31-37-38).
THERE W ILL BE GREAT STRIDES IN INVENTION and in all
manner of crafts. There will come into being, many things that would
now be considered as miracles; but which are ordained to emerge from
the Cosmic Matrix, in accordance with God’s Plan.
THERE W ILL BE AN UNUSUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPIRIT
WORLD, and those in the flesh will, in time, be able to communicate
with those who have departed from then bodies, as easily as you and I,
right now, my darling, are communicating with each other,—
because
< 16
L etters of Prophecy 17
men and women will live sane, quiet and reverent and clean lives, so that
it will be comparatively easy for one to sense spiritual vibrations and
thoughts and impulses from the Higher Spheres. (Isaiah XI, 9)
THE PEOPLE REMAINING W ILL BE PROLIFIC, and the birthv
of new beings, and the re-incarnation of many of the more deserving
who were killed in tire great wars and in the awful cataclysm, produced
by the fall of the Great Rock, will be brought back into new bodies, and
will be given a chance to grow and mature under the best possible con­
ditions. (21-44-46-50).
I SEE WONDERFUL BEINGS WHO W ILL LEAD AND GUIDE
AND TEACH HUMANITY, and our Lord will reign in love and justice
to all. Those who will not conform to the laws of GOOD, will be de­
stroyed, so that nothing inharmonious can enter into the body of the
Human Family.
And now, my precious one, I will try to tell you about some of the
wonderful changes that will take place in the scheme of life. You have
yourself sensed the needs for certain reforms and have even expressed
your views to others. But they are only a few of the many changes that
will be brought about.
THERE W ILL BE NO TARIFF WALLS. There will be no armies
for slaying people. But there will be GREAT INDUSTRIAL ARMIES
to over-come the forces of nature, and to plant and harvest for all the
people.
THE PRODUCTS OF THE SOIL and labor; the grain, fruits and
vegetables, as well as the coal and metals and ALL SOURCES OF
POWER, W ILL BE THE PROPERTY OF ALL THE PEOPLE. There
will be Government distribution to all alike, without favor or preferment.
THERE W ILL BE NO MONEY SUCH AS WE KNOW IT TODAY!
But there will be credits GIVEN, regularly, at stated intervals, to all
workers. AND EVERY MAN AND WOMAN W ILL WORK AT SOME­
THING. The compensation in credits will be like a bank account: only,
instead of dollars and cents, it will be in the nature of HOURS, MIN­
UTES and SECONDS, BASED UPON A UNIT OF SIXTY.-For this
number can be divided equally without remainder, by more digits than
any other number. (10)
THERE W ILL BE A FIXED TIME TO WORK, TO REST AND TO
SLEEP. Eight hours for each.
THERE W ILL BE NO BANK FAILURES, for there will be no gold
18 T hy Kingdom Come
(as representing labor) to excite cupidity. It will all be available for
use in Arts and Crafts.
THERE WILL BE A PERIOD WHEN ONE IS RETIRED upon cred­
its of time put in laboring.
THERE WILL BE NO SUCH THING AS INSURANCE COMPAN­
IES, for every man, woman and child will have adequate protection,
automatically provided.
SICKNESS WILL BE PROMPTLY ATTENDED TO and most
troubles will be eliminated through clean living and clean blood streams.
But such as (do) need attention will have the best and most skilled
knowledge without charge. (10-12).
ALL WILL COME WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE,
and receive all needful things to make life pleasant. Many troubles will
be cured by prayer and faith. (42).
I intended to tell you mostly about the first ten years tonight, my dar­
ling, but I give you what I have been shown and which would seem to
me to apply more to the twenty-year period following the first decade,
during the remainder of your life in the body. These words are truth.
Believe them. t

THE FIFTH LETTER
I am again in direct contact with your consciousness, my precious one,
and rejoice at the opportunity to be again writing my thoughts to you,
and of this opportunity to continue the very important and interesting
prophetical matter. Tonight I will continue to tell you just what these
advanced Beings I have told you of, give to me. Sometimes they tell
me. Sometimes they show the things almost exactly like a moving pic­
ture of the future, and I am let describe them as best I may.
There are many things to tell, and I hardly know how to start. 1 am
finding the correct sequence of events hard to handle, but perhaps this
can be done by you later on after the evidence is all in.
FIRST, TONIGHT, I WISH TO TELL YOU OF A GREAT STORM
THAT W ILL STRIKE EUROPE, and do a terrible damage to life and
property. This will come in about seven or eight years time. Things
seem to be coming almost to a focus for the next eight years, (1941 ed­
itor) and from this focus will PROCEED MANY INDIVIDUAL LINES
OF FORCE AND DESTRUCTION in which the forces of Nature and
man-made destruction will co-operate to make the world a perfect hell
and a terrible place in which to live. At the end of the first decade, com­
mencing about twelve years from now, will begin the reconstruction per­
iod. In the ten year interval, there will be GREAT CALAMITIES AND
CATASTROPHES. (31-52-55).
THE MONETARY SYSTEMS OF ALL THE COUNTRIES W ILL
FAIL. There will be great calamities, plagues AND MANY WARNINGS
from our Father in Heaven, which will NOT be heeded by the most of
mankind. (24-28-41).
THE FORCES OF EVIL W ILL BE IN POWER and they will be
exceedingly terrible and destructive, for they will know that their time
of freedom in the world is very short. All manner of deceit and devil­
try will be practiced against the people, who will, for the most part, re­
semble a flock of persecuted and exploited sheep. (23-25).
[They are right now!—Editor.]
19
20 T hy Kingdom C ome
THERE W ILL BE NATION AFTER NATION FALL and no stabil­
ity will be found in anything.
GREAT ARMAMENTS W ILL BE BUILT UP BY THE UNITED
STATES, which will be necessary to protect this country from the jeal­
ous powers such as France and Italy. Japan, too, will have its cupidity
rampant and will be drunken with its success against China, and WILL
CAPTURE THE PHILIPPINES, GUAM AND HAWAII.
THERE W ILL BE SOME DANGER TO THE PACIFIC COAST and
its cities, similar to that which will menace the Atlantic Coast Cities,—
of destruction by POISON GAS BOMBS, brought over in enormous sub­
marines and dropped by aeroplanes.
JAPAN AND MEXICO W ILL ENTER INTO AN ALLIANCE and
they will try to split the United States in half by coming up from the
South, along the Mississippi River Valley—
but we will be prepared for
them, and in the end will be victorious over both Japan and Mexico.
I REGRET TO SAY THAT ENGLAND IS LIKELY TO SUFFER
TREMENDOUS LOSSES from the Great Rock that will fall upon the
armies at war. But THE ENGLISH SPEAKING RACE IS DESTINED
TO START THE NEW SUPER-RACE, and there will be full and co-
operative action on the part of the United States, Canada and England.
(32).
CANADA W ILL ABOLISH THE BORDER, aDd a decree will be
published uniting the two countries in one. England will also unite
with Canada and the United States in ideals and objectives, but the loss
of life in the British Isles will be something terrific,—a mere handful re­
maining after the Great Rock hits.
IT W ILL FALL. PARTLY IN RUSSIA AND PARTLY IN AUSTRIA
OR GERMANY. But so large a Planetoid, striking so near England, will
slay a great multitude by shock, by the heat generated and the gases
that will be generated and the terrific disturbance of the weather.
THERE WILL BE SEVERAL HUGE PIECES IN THE PLANET­
OID. Some striking in the sea and raising a spout of water so high much
of it will fall in the United States. Great floods and atmospheric dis­
turbances will take place, with great loss of life and property.
THERE W ILL BE THE WILDEST TERROR MANIFESTED
WHEN THE GREAT ROCK IS FIRST SIGHTED. Astronomers will
/
L etters of Prophecy 21
try to compute what part of the earth will be struck. There will be no
place to flee to. No place any one can go for safety.
BUT I W ILL TELL YOU BEFOREHAND THAT THE REGION
OF LONGITUDE WHERE CHICAGO LIES, W ILL BE THE SAFEST
IN ALL THE WORLD, and you should try to be there. (17-18-20-23-
25-26-29-30-31-36-53-55-57).
AFTER THE GREAT ROCK FALLS, THERE W ILL BE NO MORE
FIGHTING. There will be a great silence and fear and sorrow and
mourning and lamentation by all who remain alive in all the earth. And
then prayers will be offered up to our Father in Heaven, who will re­
spond, and Christ will come, as I have already told you in a previous
letter.
AFTER OUR LORD COMES, Re-construction will be commenced
and gradually order will be brought out of horror and an entire new plan
of life and work and civilization will be established under Christ and
the Twelve Apostles. (30-31-37).
WHEN YOU SEE THE GREAT WAR START, THEN REJOICE
AND LOOK UP, for your redemption draweth nigh. And now, I will close
as we are very tired with the emotional strain. Believe what I have told
you for it comes from the very Source of Truth.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE SIXTH LETTER
I am so glad to be once again touching your consciousness with my
written thoughts and, indeed, I touch you so often in the working hours
in countless ways, and it is often most interesting to note your uncon­
scious response to my thought. I can always tell when it has struck home,
my darling, for your aura shows a responsive flame, and it makes me so
happy: for some day, my love, you and I will not need to use the pen
at all but can think to each other and converse just as well as we ever
did, when I was with you in the body.
I would like to give you some more of the prophetic matter that I con­
sider to be of the first importance at this time. I have alreadv told you
some startling facts that time will prove to be exaetlv as stated. I can­
not impress vou too greatlv with the solemn earnestness and sincerity
and truthfulness of these communications.
Tonight I will have to give vou some of the outstanding highlights
that you, yourself, later on will have to fit into the proper chronologv or
sequence. It is verv difficult to give proper place and time to those
things, and I do not know that it is absolutelv necessary. The main thing
is, that these things will come to pass, within vour own life and work.
"“ALL PEOPLE WILT. BE TREATED WITH EXACT JUSTICE AND
FAIRNESS, all under benevolent rules and regulations that will mean
the greatest comfort, progress and happiness for each individual. There
will be work fer every person over the age of fifteen and suited to his
or her capacity. •
EACH W ILL RECEIVE CREDIT TN HOURS FOR THE ACTUAL
TIME WORKED, and they will be able to go to the sources of supply
and get whatever they require and have it charged against their credit.
THERE W ILL BE ONE STANDARD RATE OF COMPENSATION
ALL OVER THE WORLD. The Chinaman and the Negro and the
White man, will all be treated exactly alike and the unit standard will be
22
L etters of Prophecy 23
on the number SIXTY which, as I said in a previous letter, is capable
of more even divisions than any other number.
THRE W ILL BE AUTOMATIC INSURANCE FOR ALL WORK­
ERS, for all sorts of things, and no one will be imposed upon, or suffer
through fire or sickness or accident. Ample protection will be given un­
der the new system.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION BY THE FALL OF
THE GREAT ROCK, there will be rebuilding of houses destroyed, and
under a new system of control.
OVERBUILDING AND OVERCROWDING W ILL BE IMPOS­
SIBLE. There will be no slums and no red-light districts.
EVERY FAMILY W ILL HAVE A GOOD PLACE TO GROW AND
LIVE IN, with ample grounds—
and either in separate houses, or in large,
hotel-like institutions where heat, and water and light and all neces­
sities will be supplied.
THE GOVERNMENT WILT, BE LIKE A BENEVOLENT FATHER.
All the products of the soil will be the propertv of all the people, and
will be stored and distributed bv the Government.
THERE W ILL BE NEW RAILROADS AND CANALS BUILT BY
GREAT INDUSTRIAL ARMIES who will also develop the water pow­
er of the world and manv wonderful inventions will be made, and dis­
coveries, that will benefit all mankind. (11-12-27-40-43-44-46-50).
THE ARTS AND GRAFTS W ILL BE BROUGHT TO A HIGH DE­
GREE OF PERFECTION, and buildings and sidewalks will be wonder­
fully beautified. There will be no dirtv streets.
THERE W ILI, BE A NEW SYSTEM OF TRANSPORTATION
OVER LAND, IN WHICH THE PASSENGER GARS W ILL BE PRO­
PELLED BY COMPRESSED AIR IN A LARGE TUBE,-and vou will
be able to step in the car, at where New York would be, and alight in
Chicago in about an hour, and at Sian Francsico in two and one half
hours. So this system will supercede the use of the aeroplane for speed
and safety, although travel in the air will be made wonderfully interest­
ing and safe.
THERE W ILL BE A SYSTEM OF DOMESTIC TRAINING FOR
THE GIRLS that will make them good housekeepers and mothers.
PARENTS W ILL BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ACTIONS AND CONDUCT OF THEIR CHILDREN, and the
children will obey their parents, and respect age and infirmity. There
24 T hy Kingdom C om e
will be consideration for others and the whole human race will become
human and considerate and honest. There will not be locks required
upon the doors. (12).
EACH MAN AND WOMAN W ILL HAVE A NUMBER GIVEN TO
HIM OR HER AT BIRTH, and finger prints taken (later on, it is as­
sumed she means) and filed away in government archives, and identifi­
cation will be swift and certain, and one’s property will bear the indi­
vidual’s number, all worked out in a simple and most effective system.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE SEVENTH LETTER
I AM SO EAGER TO OPEN UP THE PAGES OF THE FUTURE
TO YOU, for they are filled with most wonderful things that have been
spoken about by prophets of old, and which only now, are beginning to
emerge into the realm of reality and verification.
IT IS WRITTEN THAT GREAT DESTRUCTION W ILL TAKE
PLACE IN THE WORLD, and nearly all the people in the world will
be destroyed. With their destruction will go the METHODS AND HAB­
ITS OF LIFE that are mean and sordid and selfish.
WITH THE GREAT SILENCE THAT FOLLOWS THE FALL OF
THE GREAT ROCK, will come great quiet, almost as terrible as the
awful sounds and noises accompanying the great disaster, that WILL
ACTUALLY BE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. (18-20-53-57).
OUT OF THIS SILENCE W ILL ARISE THE CRY OF THE
PEOPLE FOR HELP AND GUIDANCE, AND FOR THE SAVIOUR;
who will be ready and waiting for the people to open the door and make
Him welcome. Then He will come, and a council will be held, and plans
formulated that will bring into being wonderful reforms in the life of
the people on this Planet, and before you pass out of your body you will
see these wonderful new ordinations put into operation. (37).
I SEE GREAT BUILDINGS IN WHICH ALL SORTS OF SCHOOLS
OF INSTRUCTION W ILL BE CONDUCTED. Young boys and girls
will attend these schools and be instructed in the ways of life. They will
be taught hygiene and a knowledge of their bodies and how they func­
tion, and they will be taught the arts and sciences, each one to be as­
signed to the particular work hr or she is best suited to do.
THEY W ILL BE PUT ON THE UNIVERSAL PAYROLL WHEN
THEY ARE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD and their compensation will be
based upon the number SIXTY, the same as the older folks, and right
from the start, they will be taught thrift and judgment in making de­
cisions for themselves.
25
26 T hy Kingdom Com e
THERE WIT,T, RF, NO TAXES because all things will be the property
of the people, and the effort of one will, in a minute way, benefit all
the others. (10-12-30).
BOYS AND GIRLS WILL HAVE THE SAME BUILDINGS and will
largely study together. The girls, in time, will go into higher schools
where they will be instructed in all manner of domestic service, how
to cook and keep house and select household necessities and how to be­
come successful wives and mothers.
GUIDANCE AND CONTROL BY CAPTAINS OF SOCIETY who
have the right to admonish or control those under them, will be univers­
al. After periods of probation, men and women will be graduated into
these Captaincies or will become Mentors of their communities, and will
in love and kindly consideration for others, perform their functions.
THEY W ILL HAVE AN EMBLEM OF AUTHORITY and those un­
der them will be required to obey tbem. REWARDS W ILL BE GIVEN
for real merit, or service, or accomplishment.
THERE W ILL BE NO TAILS OR SHERIFFS OR INSANE ASY­
LUMS, for those things will have been destroyed and the new way of
life will not make them necessary. (46).
ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH W ILL BE DEVEL­
OPED and put to use for the benefit of all mankind. There will be great
Power Houses generating electricity from power of compressed air, gen­
erated bv the action of the sea and waves upon pumps that store the
air in great containers and released to turn dynamos that generate the
current.
COAL AND ITS DIRT AND ASHES WILL, after a time, be abol­
ished except for the by-products of coal-tar and all work will be done
bv electricity.
RADIO W ILL BE GREATLY IMPROVED AND DEVELOPED so
that one can have just the kind of entertainment or information desired.
There will be no advertising over it, or in the newspapers such as we
have at present. ONE PAPER TO A COMMUNITY, in which there will
be no account of crime or murder. Only the news of the world and
things of general interest and that make for intellectual culture.
ONLY A COMPARATIVELY FEW MAGAZINES W ILL BE PUB­
LISHED, but many books of entertainment, science, philosophy and
clean romance.
L etters of Prophecy 27
MOVING PICTURES ARE TO BE RETAINED, But they will be
clean and for intelligent people; for the moron will have to go. ACTORS
AND ACTRESSES W ILL NOT BE OVERPAID, and will rejoice in
their ability to entertain, amuse and rest people, tired from their reg­
ular occupations.
SPORTS, AS WE KNOW THEM, W ILL NOT BE PERMITTED. But
contests of skill and strength will always be held. The graft-and-racket
aspects will be emasculated from the social life of the people; and all
will be conducted decently and in order.
WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES W ILL BE MADE IN THE UNI­
VERSE through the use of Great Telescopes, AND THERE W ILL BE
RADIO'MESSAGES RECEIVED FROM VENUS THAT IN TIME
WILL BE INTERPRETED, and then the Lord’s saying: “Other sheep
have I, that are not of this fold”—
will be clearly understood.
INTERPLANETARY CONVERSATIONS W ILL BE A FACT, and
many interesting, wonderful and astounding things will be learned from
Venus and other orbs in the heavens. EARTHS, OR WORLDS LIKE
OUR OWN, that have other beings in the process of development, and
where those learning their lessons on (this) earth will be some day given
access to in their turn, — and
IT W ILL BECOME UNIVERSALLY KNOWN THAT LIFE IS
ETERNAL, and that progress and advancement and knowledge are eter­
nal and unlimited. I will tell you just a few more facts tonight, my dar­
ling, and then I will have to leave you as we get very tired with the
strain.
(NOTE: At this point the communicator was asked how, or in what
manner she obtained and disseminated the information or knowledge
contained in these Prophecy Letters, and her reply follows:)
THE WAY I GET THIS MATTER IS AS FOLLOWS: Those ad­
vanced beings know that you place your hand at their disposal each
night and they hold themselves in readiness to attend. Then they either
TELL ME OR SHOW TO ME THOSE THINGS THAT ARE TO
COME TO PASS LIKE A MOVING PICTURE THAT IS TO BE RE­
LEASED, and I tell, or think, the whole thing to dear Cromwell, who
uses her splendid power to record them on paper, using your dear hand.
You and she and I are true spiritual affinities .Something very rare; or
this way of communication and recording would be quite impossible. It
is as wonderful to me, my darling, as it is to you.
28 T hy Kingdom Come
Something I wish to record now, while it is fresh, is that the forces of
the heavens, the pull of the planets will be studied and their astrological
and astronomical influences and facts will be made use of in the life of
the people.
THERE W ILL BE SCIENTIFIC WEATHER FORECASTING, AND
OTHER NEW PLANETS W ILL BE DISCOVERED IN OUR SOLAR
SYSTEM, and much predictive matter of a scientific nature will be pos­
sible.
HUMAN CHARACTER W ILL STILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH
OVERCOMING AND SELF-DISCIPLINE. Human curiosity and re­
search will then as it does now, bring into the light of knowledge many
wonderful things, some of which I shall tell you in later letters. The re­
wards will go to those whose industry, ability and resolution bring about
these discoveries. (11-27-44).

THE EIGHTH LETTER
Here I am again, giving you the old loving greeting, which is ever new
and fresh, in that language of the heart, that needs no words, nor pen on
paper. I am most thankful to our Heavenly Father for His goodness in
making it possible to give you accurate and truthful advance informa­
tion concerning those things that shall transpire in and on this old world
during the next ten years and beyond to the half century mark.
First, I wish to confirm the truth and accuracy of all I have given you
so far. and to again assume full responsibility for the matter that has
already been set down. I also approve the way you are doing in em­
phasizing the various items I have given you.
(At this point there was a pause of three
minutes. Then the letter proceeds:)
And now, my precious one, I have just returned with some of those
illuminated beings who have shown me some very important and inter­
esting events that are to take place about the time the Great Rock smites
Europe. As I told you before,
IT W ILL STRIKE RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA OR GERMANY, BUT
FRANCE AND ITALY AND SPAIN will suffer terrible disasters from
the awful heat and shock that will ensue.
GREAT STORMS OF TERRIFIC VOLUME W ILL TAKE PLACE
ALL OVER THE WORLD, and there will be SNOW AND HAIL AND
AWFUL LIGHTNINGS AND ELECTRICAL DISPLAYS that will also
slay many and frighten many of the timid to death. (53-54-57).
THERE W ILL BE A REMNANT OF ALL NATIONALITIES'
SPARED, however, and there will be a completely unified National
Consciousness in which the Brotherhood of Man will have its first rec­
ognition.
MUCH OF WHAT IS NOW ENGLAND W ILL SINK BELOW THE
SEA FROM THE SHOCK, and there will be LOST CONTINENTS
REAPPEAR IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN, AND ANCIENT CIVILIZA- /
29
30 T hy Kingdom Come
TIONS THAT FORMERLY INHABITED THESE LOST CONTI­
NENTS will, in time, be uncovered and much will be learned concern­
ing the peoples that preceded the present Root Race. (8-53).
THE LOST LAND THAT COMES UP TO THE LIGHT OF DAY
AGAIN, WILL BE MOST FERTILE and rich in gold and minerals and
precious stones, all of which will be used in the arts and crafts.
MANY FISH IN THE SEA W ILL BE KILLED, and there will be
a Great Plague of stench that will last some months. (55).
MANY OF THE DESERT PLACES IN THE WORLD W ILL AGAIN
BECOME MOST FERTILE and many fertile areas now, will become
sterile and barren.
THE EARTH, BEING DRIVEN CLOSER TO THE SUN BY THE
IMPACT OF THE GREAT ROCK, will experience many undreamed-of
climatic changes and new species of trees, plants and flowers will ap­
pear. (8-11).
THE TROPICS W ILL BE VERY HOT, and only certain vegetation
will exist.
The ice caps will recede and the great North will become almost tem­
perate, so that the world will become an entirely different planet in so
far as its physical aspect is concerned. i
CHRIST W ILL APPEAR IN THE HEAVENS W ITH POWER AND
GREAT GLORY, with a Heavenly host, shortly after the Great Rock has
hit the earth, in response to a universal prayer for His appearance.
(30-37).
HE W ILL ESTABLISH HIS GOVERNMENT IN THE HOLY
LAND, in a Great City that will ,be built according to His instructions.
This will take several years, and after the city is built, there will be a
GREAT TEMPLE CONSTRUCTED THEREIN from which all power
and guidance will issue to all His creatures. (13-27-28-30-37-46).
IN EVERY CITY IN THE WORLD, THERE W ILL BE FROM ONE
TO SIX OTHER TEMPLES OF SIMILAR DESIGN CONSTRUCTED
and the people will enter into them to worship the Lord in Spirit and in
Truth. All will know the Lord of Hosts is in the earth and will consider
it a privilege to attend and offer their homage, praise and worship.
IT W ILL BE POSSIBLE FOR EVERY PERSON IN THE WORLD
TO ACTUALLY HEAR THE VOICE OF OUR LORD, through radio
installation, and there will be many wonderful and inspiring things from
our Lord. (1-27-37-46-47-48-50).
L etters of Prophecy 31
EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD W ILL BE EXPECTED TO VISIT
THE NEW JERUSALEM AT LEAST ONCE DURING THEIR L IF E ­
TIME. While they may not actually see our Lord, Who is a Spirit, cap­
able of appearing and vanishing, still, MANY W ILL ACTUALLY BE­
HOLD HIM, and receive direct answers and comfort and blessing from
Him. (27-28-44).
THE WORLD W ILL BE GOVERNED BY THE TW ELVE APOST­
LES, and the world will be divided into twelve districts or departments,
with an Apostle over each, and all being worked out in unison, in justice
and in Brotherly Love.
MANY OF THE SAINTS W ILL APPEAR IN RENEWED BODIES
FROM TIME TO TIME, and many of the inhabitants will be able to
see and speak with them.
THE SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL MYSTERIES OF LIFE W ILL
BE SO INTERWOVEN that people, many of them, will be able to func­
tion on two planes at once. AN ALMOST FOURTH DIMENSIONAL
STATE OF BEING.

THE NINTH LETTER
I am so happy to be again talking to you. Everything is brought about
by pre-arrangement and ordination, by God’s servants. (A 3-min. pause).
I have returned with those illuminated beings, the wise ones of the
Spiritual Realms, who are again ready to reveal the future. I will show
you something more about the social conditions that will be prevalent
in about fifteen years from the fall of the Great Rock.
THERE WILL BE A UNIVERSAL TRAINING SYSTEM FOR BOTH
BOYS AND GIRLS, all under a sort of military discipline. HABITS OF
INDUSTRY, TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE will be thoroughly in­
culcated. As a class grows and is perfected in these things, they will be­
come members of another corps, still under military discipline, and the
boy or girl will be measured carefully, with regard to his or her personal
ability, capacity and aptitudes.
HUMAN NATURE AND CAPACITY W ILL D IFFER THEN the
same as they do now, but all will be helped and encouraged to do their
very best. Rewards will be sure, and advancement or promotion auto­
matic.
NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THEIR REWARD any more than they can
escape censure for deliberate mistakes. PUNISHMENT W ILL BE
SWIFT, SURE AND UNESCAPABLE. SUCH W ILL BE HELD BACK
IN LOWER CORPS, will see their own-age comrades ALWAYS
AHEAD OF THEM, as they progress through life. THEY CAN NEVER
CATCH UP.
THE ADULTS ALSO W ILL BE HANDLED IN THE SAME WAY
Some will be more intelligent than others. Older souls re-incarnating
for probably the last time and these will rapidly make a superior place
in the social and industrial work of the world, and will be given great­
er responsibilities and will be compensated in a larger scale and enjoy
certain distinctions, such as the various ranks of the Army, today. As I
told you in a former letter,
DEATH W ILL BE REDUCED GREATLY. But those who pass out
L etters of Prophecy 33
of their bodies will not be able to leave their credits to friends or rel­
atives. Hence,
THERE CAN BE NO W ILL AS WE KNOW THEM TODAY. Each
person does his or her work in the world approvedly and will have
enough of everything to make life a joy and an unending pleasure—
just
as our Heavenly Father intended.
NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF THE WORLD WHEN ONE
DIES ANY MORE THAN CAN BE TAKEN OUT NOW-NAMELY,
CHARACTER AND SPIRITUAL MATURITY. There will be no more
control of illgotten gains by dead hands. There will be no more graft,
or thievery, or dishonesty, or tips, or prerequisites, or racketeers or prof­
iteers.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT W ILL BE ABOLISHED AFTER THE
FIRST TEN YEARS. But it will be made use of up until then, to elim­
inate those souls with the soil of evil still clinging to them. All (such)
will be destroyed by Decree of the Twelve who will rule the earth, un­
der the command and direction and guidance of our Lord and Savior.
(32-37).
DIFFERENCES W ILL OCCUR, OF COURSE. But these differences
will be heard by men and women of integrity, who will render decisions
and pass judgments that will stand.
THE COURTS OF LAW SUCH AS WE HAVE TODAY, W ILL BE
A THING OF THE PAST. In the mouths of two or three witnesses shall
the matter be established. No one will be able to lie about the matter
for there will be those present who will be able to detect ANY FALSE­
HOOD BY OBSERVING THE AURA of the witnesses, the plaintiff and
the defendant. It will soon be well known that a lie will be impossible for
it will be instantly detected and the judgment will be rendered accord­
ingly and the liar will be punished by having his credit rate reduced and
certain advantages with it, will also be forfeited, and he or she W ILL
NEVER BE ABLE TO REGAIN THE FORMER PLACE ON
THE ASCENDING SPIRAL OF PROGRESS AND ACCOMPLISH­
MENT. (37).
ABSOLUTE JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS WILL OBTAIN IN ALL
THE WORLD, to all peoples, races and localities. THERE W ILL BE
NO FAVORITISM SHOWN TO ANYONE. What a man or woman
earns, they shall thoroughly enjoy IN PEACE and security, free from
fear or molestation.
34 T hy Kingdom Come
THERE IS NO REASON (BARRING ACCIDENTS) WHY THE
SPAN OF LIFE SHOULD NOT BE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED
YEARS OR LONGER. Wonderful discoveries in rejuvenation will be
made and people will not pollute their bodies with tobacco and rum and
drugs and other forms of ADULTERATION. Today, they “commit
adultery” just as much in their sensual habits of life as they do from the
sexual standoint. And yet, they do not realize that this is so. (1-12-21-
27-46).
HABITS OF LIFE W ILL BE ENTIRELY CHANGED, and they will
be formed early in life.
PARENTS W ILL BE HELD ABSOLUTELY RESPONSIBLE for the
acts and proper training of their children until they enter the first corps
of instruction at about eight. They will be put on the Universal pay-roll
when they are fifteen, and from then on, will be advanced and increased
as they prove their industry, ability and worth.
WITH REGARD TO PROPERTY AND LAND. There will be no ex­
clusive ownership of land. It is the property of all the people and the
products thereof and thereon, and will be conserved and held at suitable
points of distribution.
INSOFAR AS THE HOUSES THAT PEOPLE LIVE IN: There will
be plenty of houses for families, and they will be registered at the local
point and will carry the individual number of the head of the family.
WHEN A MAN OR A WOMAN DIES the home will be re-registered
in the name and number of the surviving elder; wife, or other member
of the family, and when disposed of it will pass along to other people
and their Dumber be given to it.
EVERY MAN AND WOMAN WILL, AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD
YOU, BE GIVEN A DECIMAL NUMBER, just like the Duodecimal
system, that will remain with him as long as he lives. All his personal
property will have this number stamped premanently thereon or there­
in, so if lost, the owner can be easily found; for there will BE A COM­
PLETE SET OF FINGER PRINTS and corresponding number filed
away in the Capitol of each countrv so that no man or woman can live
without easy and positive identification—
no matter where they may go
throughout the earth.
SHOULD A MAN OR A WOMAN MOVE AWAY he will have to re-
L etters of Prophecy 35
port, and show his number to his new location and Commanding Officer
and record from whence he came, so there will be no possible way for
him to do wrong and hide, or go elsewhere and change his name, because
he must be known in and to his own community before he can draw what
supplies he needs.
And now it is getting late and you are tired and so are we with the
great effort, for us, that must be expended to gather and record this
matter.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE TENTH LETTER
Again the moment has arrived when I can pour out my love to you on
paper so that you will know without a doubt or without your thinking
MY thoughts, are an echo of your sub-conscious mind. It is always a
privilege to contact your fine mind in this way and to have the respons-
in your aura. For you are most responsive to spiritual and higher influ­
ences. Yora love is like a beautiful flame. And now J will leave for a
moment and soon return with those who will tell me the things I am
to transmit to you. (Here occurs a pause of three minutes).
I am back with those who will again give me the prophetic matter
for this letter. I have shown (in previous letters) that the social struc­
ture of the world will rest upon absolute fairness and impartiality. So
will also the Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical workers and work.
EACH UNIT THEREIN WILL BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT,
having placed at his or her opportunity, chances to learn and make
progress. They can either learn and advance, or they can loaf and just
get by. But thev will soon learn that they will not have the comforts
and luxuries and advantages that others have that do their best.
FREQUENT REWARDS FOR DEXTERITY AND KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERTNESS will be made and those who work hard and expend
themselves in the service of humanity will win retirement and honor,
just that much more quickly.
IT WILL BE THE BUSINESS OF THE WOMEN TO RAISE FAM­
ILIES AND MAINTAIN THE HOME, until they are past the child­
bearing age, when they will, after a few years, be able to join in the
work, research and pleasures, in competition with the men, and will
prove themselves the equal, and often the superiors, of men.
DURING ALL THE TIME THEY ARE RAISING FAMILIES AND
KEEPING HOUSE, they will be earning their credits, and will be inde­
pendent of the earning power of the men folks; but, in innumerable in-
ivn thrill of pleasure and happiness I always note in the change of color
L etters of Prophecy 37
stances, they will pool their credits with their husbands and will mutual­
ly ask for and receive all things needful.
YOUNG CHILDREN W ILL BE KEPT OFF THE STREETS and
they canot go around begging, nor working for credits until they are fif­
teen years old. There will be no selling things, or peddling of any kind,
so annoying and senseless in these days.
THEY W ILL BE TAUGHT OBEDIENCE and will have to conduct
themselves courteously and politely.
And now I will close for this time. I am not quite ready to set down
other wonderful things tonight, but will (do'so) soon.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE ELEVENTH LETTER
I am anxious to continue making the record of future events that are
being given to me by those illuminated and advanced beings for your
own use, and for the information of those to whom you will give these
letters; for we wish to have as wide a publicity given to this truth as can
be given to it. And now, I will go ahead with the record.
I HAVE BEEN TOLD AND SHOWN MANY FEARSOME AND IN­
TERESTING THINGS THAT W ILL OCCUR AFTER THE GREAT
ROCK STRIKES. IT W ILL COME IN THE SUMMER TIM E AND
WILL BRING ABOUT SUCH GREAT CHANGES IN THE WEATH­
ER, THAT ALL CROPS W ILL BE PRACTICALLY RUINED. (27).
NOTHING CAN BE PRODUCED IN THE EARTH FOR OVER A
YEAR, until after the unusual disturbances have subsided, which will
be several months before the weather is completely settled once more.
THERE W ILL BE ENOUGH CRAIN OF ALL KINDS HELD IN
STORAGE, HOWEVER, IN AMERICA AND CANADA, to feed all
who remain alive, for a year, until the new crops are harvested, if it is
all carefully conserved by those in authority.
THERE WILL BE HUGE STORES OF CANNED GOQDS AND
FOODS OF ALL KINDS also available, to help out, and it will be care­
fully apportioned or rationed out to all the people of the world who re­
main alive.
THIS UNIVERSAL NECESSITY AND METHOD OF HANDLING
THE PROBLEM will be the beginning of the Distributive System that
will come into universal application.
ALL THINGS W ILL BE THE PROPERTY OF ALL THE PEOPLE,
and they will be rationed out, until the Universal Credit System is in
operation.
THERE W ILL BE AN OVER-STOCK OF HOUSES, BUILDINGS,
MATERIALS OF ALL KINDS. Automobiles, trucks, clothing, shoes, and
0U manner of merchandise also, " '’ll be gathered together at various
38
L etters of Prophecy 39
focal points and passed out to all who need them. So will the system be
continued with many improvements, all over the world.
SHOPS, RAILROAD CARS AND AEROPLANES AND ALL
MANNER OF TRANSPORTATION WILL, LIKEWISE, be operated
by the Government for the benefit of ALL THE PEOPLE, and costs
and competition that is so ruinous and expensive will, in time, be com­
pletely done away with.
AS I TOLD YOU, (previously) MANY NEW WONDERS IN SCI­
ENCE AND IN TRANSPORTATION OF THE PEOPLE AND MER­
CHANDISE, will be developed and put into operation.
THE GOVERNMENT W ILL BE A BENEVOLENT AUTOCRACY,
in which every man, woman and child, BORN AND UNBORN, will get
a square deal. For the Brotherhood of Man, will he ushered in hi/ our
Heavenly Father who will guide and direct the commerce and life of
the entire world, through the) Twelve Apostles, who will each be the
head authority in his district. (26-27-28-37-38).
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES, after a time, will he surveyed
and COMPLETELY STANDARDIZED, ADMINISTERED AND CON­
TROLLED.
ONE UNIVERSAL UNIT OF MEASUREMENT W ILL BE ADOPT­
ED, similar to the French Metric System, and sizes will be exactly uni­
form all over the world, so, if a person needs to replace a certain thing,
or part, he can obtain it exactly as it was.
FOOLISH FADS AND ABSURD OR EXTREME STYLES OF
MERCHANDISE will be prohibited. The BEST ideas and plans will be
adopted and utilized until something that is reallv better is invented or
discovered to take its place. One set of standaid shoe lasts will be adopt­
ed, and STYLES THAT CHANGE EVERY FEW MONTHS W ILL BE
FORBIDDEN.
PLUMBING FIXTURES, TOO, W ILL BE UNIFORM, and all things
will be obtainable at a mere fraction of what is charged for them now.
For every man, woman and child, over the age of fifteen, will be con­
tributing their own ability and labor to production of all needful things
and in servicing machines and merchandise that need it.
ALL CEMETERIES W ILL DISAPPEAR,-for it will become uni­
versally known that the body is nothing but a discarded garment
flesh and that IT IS THE SPIRIT THAT COUNTS.
BODIES W ILL BE CREMATED, unless people are lost at sea,
40 T hy Kingdom Com e
meet sudden death where their shells cannot be reached. All foolish
sentimentality about death and its sorrow will eventually be cleared
away from the public consciousness, and the REAL EGO, —
THE SPIR­
ITUAL PART OF MAN, will be known. (39-50).
AND SO WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT THE FULFILM ENT OF
ST. PAUL’S SAYING: “Death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death,
where is thy sting? Oh grave, whereas thy victory?” (I Cor. XV, 55).
IN THE LARGE CITIES OR CENTERS OF POPULATION THERE
W ILL BE developed a wonderful system of transportation, similar to
the TRANSCONTINENTAL PNEUMATIC SYSTEM I have already
briefly described in former letters. Only on a much smaller scale, of
course. It will make it very easy to live in the country ten or even fifty,
or a hundred miles from a man’s place of business and leave his home at
eight o’clock and alight in his neighborhood, down town at eight-fifteen.
TRAVEL W ILL BE SWIFT, PLEASANT, CLEAN AND COMFORT­
ABLE, at low cost in Credit Currency. It will be the aim to see HOW
MUCH CAN BE GIVEN for the credit “money” rather than how little,
as it is the case now, AND THIS WILL APPLY TO EVERYTHING
THAT LIFE REQUIRES.
THERE W ILL BE FEWER RESTAURANTS, but they will be much
larger and the food will be cheap and clean and wholesome. The service
silent, swift and courteous. PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE ONE LARGE
FAMILY.
I will have many more wonderful things to tell you in future letters.
But now, I will say good night.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE TWELFTH LETTER
I am here with those illuminated beings who show me the future con­
ditions coming upon the world and record those things and circum­
stances confronting the human race during the next fifty 'years.
MANY CHILDREN ABOUT TO BE BORN DURING THE NEXT
TWO OR THREE YEARS will, if they are spared in the Great De­
struction,—
live to see every prediction I have made to you in these letters
completely fulfilled.
IT IS GOD’S PLAN FOR THE ESTABLISHING OF THE NEW
DISPENSATION, and I may tell you that the people in the world today
are so blinded by selfish greed for gold, searching for thrills and running
after false gods THAT ONLY THROUGH SOME GREAT WORLD
DISASTER LIKE THAT COMING UPON THE EARTH BY THE
FALL OF THE GREAT ROCK, can they be made ready to forsake
their evil ways, and look up to the God that is READY AND WAITING
TO COME TO EARTH, and make all things new, and clean and fresh
and fine and fair.
I HAVE SHOWN THAT TAXES AS WE KNOW THEM TODAY,
WILL ALL BE DONE AWAY WITH. There will be no need of taxes
when all the people pool their time and creative effort, and are produc­
ing the things the people need. This is a miracle that will, in time, ac­
tually take place. (46-50).
WHERE NEW ROADS ARE NEEDED, OR SEWERS, OR FIRE
PROTECTION or anything else that is taxed today to pay for them,
ALL WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED, for every avenue of
production will be stimulated.
EVERY PERSON EMPLOYED, from the men who build the road­
making machinery to those who use it in actual construction, will be re­
ceiving their credits. So will all the clerks and record-keepers and every
individual who even remotely touches the enterprise. From those who
dig the iron ore and transport it, to those who make the steel that goes
41
42 T hy Kingdom Com e
into the machinery. All, without exception, will be amply taken care o
l
ON THE SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL CREDITS I have told you about
in former letters.
I HAVE REEN SHOWN A PICTURE OF GREAT INDUSTRIAL
ARMIES, all under a strict military discipline, working at building roads
across the Continental Areas, both new and old, tilling the soil and
harvesting the crops.
THERE W ILL NOT BE SO MANY INDIVIDUAL FARMS, for the
land will be set aside for raising crops, and dairying, and planting young
trees that will, later on, be transplanted into forests, ALL BY ARMIES
OF WORKERS, under officers to command and direct them. They will
be entertained, and drilled in setting-up exercises, and the life will be
very interesting and healthy.
MANY WILL ENLIST IN THESE INDUSTRIAL ARMIES FOR
THE TRAINING THEY W ILL RECEIVE and the physical benefit ac­
cruing, and the knowledge they will acquire to fit themselves for more
important work that many will be transferred into.
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN W ILL BE UTILIZED IN THESE AR­
MIES. The men to do the heavy manual labor and run the great culti­
vating machines and the women to cook and do domestic things. That is;
the women who have not become wives and mothers, and have homes
of their own to attend to. (11-12-27-28).
There will be a great army employed in the construction of the
GREAT TRANSCONTINENTAL PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS OF TRANS­
PORTATION I have already told you about. Other armies will develop
ALL THE ELECTRIC POWER FROM WATERFALLS AND DAMS,
all over the United States, AND IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD.
WHAT I HAVE SAID CONCERNING THESE WONDERS DOES
NOT APPLY ONLY TO THE UNITED STATES, you understand, but
to EVERY NATION AND PLACE UNDER THE SUN.
THERE WILL RE GREAT RESEARCH LABORATORIES that will
. learn many of the secrets of nature and develop new power, and ma­
chines with which to apply it.
THE PRESENT TYPE OF AUTOMOBILE WILL, in twenty ynars,
be regarded as a great joke for many more wonderful machines, pow­
ered by small batteries that can almost be carried in the pocket, will
whisk people on the surface roads with great speed and without noise,
dirt, dust, vibration or any of our present “modern” accomplishments.
L etters of Prophecy 43
IT WILL RE EASY TO TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE D I­
RECTLY THROUGH THE EARTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE, to peoples
and individuals on the other side of the earth, and pick out a particular
person. Radio waves and special receiving apparatus will enable this to
be done and it will be far quicker and simpler than through the air, as at
present.
THE CLIMATIC CHANGES that I have described in a former letter
will make the latitude of New York almost as hot as it is now on the
Equator. CIVILIZATION W ILL TREK TO WHAT IS NOW THE FAR
NORTH and many deposits of mineral and an advancing .vegetation
will make a garden spot of the great Northern and Southern hemispheres,
in the next hundred years. (8).
IT W ILL BECOME UNIVERSALLY KNOWN THAT MEAT
FOODS ARE NOT HEALTHY and animals will not be killed for their
flesh, as they are now.
GRAINS AND FRESH VEGETABLES, many eaten without cooking,
will be the chief diet, with, of course, many old and new fruits and nuts.
GREAT HERDS OF COWS W ILL CONTINUE TO GIVE MAN­
KIND MILK, as they do now, and there will be no rival milk companies,
as there are now. But the milk will be distributed under one management
and it will, like all other things, be used abundantly by all the people.
THERE W ILL BE NO INSANE ASYLUMS AND NO OBSESSION
OF INDIVIDUALS BY EVIL ENTITIES, AS THERE ARE NOW. All
these kind are absolutely banished INTO OUTER DARKNESS FOR A
THOUSAND YEARS. After a thousand ifears is ended, then will come
come OUR LORD’S SECOND JUDGMENT UPON ALL THE WORLD
AND UPON THE W ORLD OF SPIRIT.
THOSE WHO REPENT AND CONFORM TO THE LAWS OF
GOOD, will be permitted to work out their destiny. But those who are
evil, AFTER THEY HAVE HAD THEIR CHANCE, will be absolutely
and UTTERLY ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED.
THIS W ILL BE THE SECOND DEATH, told about in the Book of
Revelation. (47-48-49).
AND AFTER THAT, UNIVERSAL PEACE AND LOVE, and justice
will reign forever upon the earth, UNTIL IT IS DESTROYED BY FIRE,
as told in the Bible,- TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER AND LARG­
ER AND MORE ADVANCED SOLAR SYSTEM.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE THIRTEENTH LETTER
I am here with my informants and will set down just what they tell
me. First, I want to thank you for sitting each night so patiently and
lending your hand, and going to all the labor to put these letters in
proper shape for reading. They should be put into book form and I
know they will be, very soon, for ways and means will be opened to
you to have them published.
CHRIST W ILL, as I said in previous letters, COME TO EARTH
SOON AFTER THE CREAT ROCK HITS THE PLANET. He tmil take
charge of all matters and will establish all things new. (37-44).
THERE W ILL BE VERY FEW LAWS, SUCH AS WE HAVE THEM
TODAY. All people will be compelled to observe the Golden Rule or,
HAVE DONE UNTO THEM THE THINGS THEY DO UNTO OTH­
ERS. People who delberately find fault or are dissatisfied with the serv­
ice of others accorded them, will have to serve in the ranks and get the
other fellow’s angle of it. If a woman cannot be satisfied, because of a
DISAGREEABLE NATURE, she will be put in the clerk’s position for
a long enough time to learn courtesy, and the unfairness of her own at­
titude.
ABSOLUTE JUSTICE TEMPERED BY SYMPATHY AND BROTH­
ERLY LOVE, will be meted out to every adult—
and thus will be brought
into fulfillment the words of Christ that: “As ye mete, so shall it be
measured to you again, heaped up, pressed down and running over.”
(Mat. VII-2). So it will behoove ALL, to have that saying applied in a
happy and advantageous sense. And THAT it will not take long to learn
THERE W ILL BE NO FAT BLOATED POLITICIANS who waste
the constructive effort of the people. I was about to say “The People’s
MONEY”. But that would be incorrect for the future time I am writing
about .
POLITICAL SINECURES WILL BE A THING OF THE PAST, as
will also be keeping superannuated men on the pay-roll as is done today,
44
L ettebs of Prophecy 45
and making them a burden. Such will be retired when incapacitated, and
will be able to live suitably upon the accumulation of their credit re­
serves. These will, in effect, become an endowment fund, or insurance,
or a pension,—
is the best way I can express it.
ALL THE FRUITS AND PRODUCTS OF THE EARTH-its grains,
fruits, minerals, vegetables, timber, iron and precious metals, will be
searched for, and brought forth to the greatest extent.
THERE W ILL BE NO RESTRICTING THE MARKET, to inflate
prices and run up costs, as is done now.
IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HOARD OR “CORNER” WHEAT,
or corn, or anything, for, under the Universal System of distribution and
rationing, and under the growing need of an ever increasing population
it would be a great crime upon all the people of the world to hold need­
ed food or other necessities, while some people suffered for lack of them.
IT WILL BECOME TREASON AGAINST ALL THE PEOPLE TO DO
SO.
THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD W ILL GROW BY LEAPS
AND BOUNDS after twenty-five years of re-construction have taken
place and sometimes it will be a problem to produce enough to properly
supply the population of the world. (12).
EVERYONE W ILL BE EMPLOYED AT SOME USEFUL TASK OR
WORK, and will be enabled to live in comfort, peace, plenty and secur-
ity.
THE EARTH, THAT FORMING NEW CONTINENTAL AREAS
ARISING OUT OF THE OCEAN, will be rich in gold, silver and prec­
ious stones.—
especially diamonds. It will be possible for everyone who so
desires to so apply their time credits to own, wear and enjoy a beautiful
diamond. These can be given to others, to friends if desired—
but the
giver’s own credit account will be charged, and when the possessor pass­
es on, the diamond, the accumulated credits and property of value will
be turned in to the general store or supply base to be issued to others,
for, as I have told you in a previous letter, WILLS, SUCH AS WE
HAVE THEM TODAY, will be a memory of the past. (10).
THE REMARKABLE ABILITY OF THE HUMAN RACE TO AD­
JUST ITSELF TO NEW AND STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES AND
CONDITIONS, W ILL BRING ABOUT these great reforms in life and
living much more quickly and easily than would seem possible right now.
t
46 T hy Kingdom Com e
Co-operation will be the motive power and Brotherly Love the object­
ive to be attained.
NOTHING THAT IS INJURIOUS TO ONE CAN STAND IN THE
NEW DISPENSATION, for what helps or hinders one, helps or hinders
all. (37-50).
EVERYONE’S THOUGHTS W ILL BE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE
ON A KINDLY, benevolent, sympathetic coloring. As people become
more spiritual, they will react more readily and intensively to thought.
IT IS A POWER FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL, and as GOOD is, to
be developed, ONLY THE BEST MENTAL ATTITUDES W ILL BE
ENCOURAGED, for thoughts, good or evil, will react upon the indi­
vidual who thinks them, and this law, too, will be universally recognized.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

THE FOURTEENTH LETTER
Once more I am talking to you almost with tire same ease and facil­
ity that I used to do in the body. I always rejoice when the moment
comes to visit with you and talk to you for you are so very dear and
precious to me. And now we are ready to proceed with the prophetic
matter. First, we wish to urge you to be sure and lay in plenty of food
of all kinds when the great war occurs, for FOOD W ILL BE VERY
SCARCE, _and especially after the Great Rock strikesi it will be still
harder to get. (52).
THE FAILURE OF THE CROPS DUE TO GREAT WEATHER
CHANGES will also put food at a premium. Of course there will also
be immediate conservation of all food and grain supplies, that will be
rationed out. But A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FOOD IN THE HOUSE
IS IMPORTANT and most essential to your own well-being and that of
your friends and associates. You should lay in flour, and rice, and canned
goods, beans and sugar, thmgs that will sustain life and maintain stren
I WISH TO SAY SOUTH AMERICA W ILL ESCAPE SOME 1
THE DESTRUCTION that will overwhelm Europe. The two Ameri
will be the cradle for a new, and Sixth Root race, and for progress
Agriculture and Industry.
AFRICA will also, AFTER FIFTY YEARS, begin to take her place in
this continental advancement. But her people are all poor and ignorant
black men, for the most part, and many of them cannot survive the great
climatic changes. Already cursed with great heat and deserts, that part
which is habitable now will be made still hotter than the hottest portion
now. But man will adjust himself after a time to work through these most
torrid portions and many dscoveries will be made of commercial products
that will benefit all mankind.
THE MANY WONDERFUL INVENTIONS, AND THE ADVANCE­
MENT OF SCIENCE will enable men and women to work in these ter-
and health. (3-6-9-18-26-30-53-57).

ribly hot zones, by carrying their own temperature with them, in air
ships, and even in their houses and cars,—
almost like a huge system of
Electric Refrigeration now.
INDIA W ILL SUFFER GREAT LOSS OF LIFE and its people will
be given a chance to grow and learn and advance, IN NEW RE-INCAR­
NATION IN NEW BODIES to be supplied during the years and cen­
turies to come, BY THE WHITE RACE.
EVENTUALLY ALL THE VARIOUS RACES: white, red, black and
yellow as we know them today, will all be one composite race with all
the advantages and genius of each race, and most of the vices overcome.
l u E NEW CONTINENTAL LAND AREAS THAT ARE TO ARISE
OUT OF THE OCEAN will appear in the Pacific Ocean, where the
islands are now. The South Sea Islands I mean, and Lost Civilizations
chastised by our Heavenly Father ages ago, for their evil ways, will
eome to light and much of value and information will be learned from
a study of these Lost Continents.
THE MAYA CIVILIZATION OF YUCATAN, and the Incas in Peru,
and the Aztecs in Mexico—
are all remnants of these lost continents, grow­
ing out of a handful of survivors of the terrible catastrophe that FLOOD­
ED THE WORLD IN AGES PAST.
THIS CATASTROPHE OF THE GREAT ROCK SMITING THE
EARTH A FEW YEARS HENCE will be more terrible in a spectacular
sense, for its approach will be known for weeks before it hits, and the
terror will be more awful for the ROCK W ILL THREATEN
PORTION OF THE EARTH AS IT TURNS ON ITS AXIS, whereas
the Lost Continents were swallowed up in a very few hours, and only
a very few people were saved.
THERE W ILL BE MANY MORE PEOPLE REMAIN ALIVE AF­
TER THE FALL OF THE GREAT ROCK than when the land sank out
of sight. But the population of.the world NOW is correspondingly great­
er than it was then. THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING AFTER THE
DISASTER will be so much better with regard to knowledge of our
Saviour and His purposes, that an increase in population will be far more
rapid that it was before, and life will be so much better for all. (21-27-
37).
And now, my precious one, I will shortly bring this letter to a close
L etters of Prophecy 49
for we are very tired. I beg you to consider seriously all that has been
given you in all these letters, and BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN
for your own information and benefit and that of your friends.
As I told you last night, there will be a way opened whereby these
letters will be made available to the public, and they will find their
way into the hands of those who will be benefited and helped thereby
when the great disaster comes, they will be forewarned and prepared,
which is the main object of this work.

THE FIFTEENTH LETTER
CONCLUSION
I love to talk to you, just as if I were still in the body, and tell you of
my ever present love, interest and companionship. And now, we will
proceed with the last of the Prophetic Matter. (Here the usual pause of
three minutes takes place).
And now, I am back with those wise and good and advanced beings,
who will bring these prophesies to an end.
I HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT GREAT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVER­
IES AND DEVELOPMENT will make the future world a Miracle 'place
to live in,—
as compared to what it is now, wonderful as this Age has
has been during the last twenty-five years.
IT W ILL BE POSSIBLE TO THINK TO YOUR FRIEND OR REL­
ATIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, and converse with
him in thought, and he with you.
ALSO AS EASILY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR BOD­
IES. You can converse with those in the spirit World this way, after the
Race becomes more spiritual, through being in God’s governed world
for a few hundred years.
SPIRITUAL THINGS AND LAWS W ILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL
STUDY AND INVESTIGATION, and many wonders in Art, Music,
Sculpture, Invention and other things W ILL BE TRANSMITTED DI­
RECT FROM THE MASTERS OF WISDOM IN THE INNER
WORLDS, to receptive men and women who will bring them into ob­
jective being.
PEOPLE, CERTAIN OF THEM, W ILL BE INSPIRED FOR GOOD,
and will labor earnestly for the benefit and betterment of all mankind.
TRAVEL, UNDER, ON AND OVER THE SEA, UNDER, ON, AND
OVER THE LAND, will be safe, swift and pleasant.
50
L etters of P rophecy 51
PERIODS OF REST AND RECREATION, will be every person’s
portion; and also travel and study.
MUCH OF THE EVIL W ILL RE BURIED IN THE EARTH by the
impact of the GREAT ROCK, and the shattering of all the Old World
Kingdoms. (2-5-23-29-35-43).
REWARDS: will go to the capable, courageous and industrious.
GRAFT, and dishonesty and false witness—
CANNOT ENDURE.
THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT, AND THE GOLDEN RULE will
stand as the greater part of religion, together with every knee bowing in
loving reverence and worship before our Lord and Savior.—Who will
send forth great Blessings, that will enable mankind to work, play and
advance in Security and Peace. (28-44).
THERE W ILL BE NO MORE MONEY, AS WE KNOW IT NOW,
Peace and plenty will obtain.
WONDERFUL CITIES W ILL ARISE, and NEW AND OLD SOULS
will be afforded every opportunity to find themselves in new incarna­
tions. BY THE TIME THE THOUSAND YEARS IS ENDED, the pop­
ulation of the earth will be bevond our power to even dream of now.
AFTER THE THOUSAND YEARS IS ENDED, then the whole people
will be judged, and all remaining alive, and those who have passed out
of their bodies will be given a final choice of doing and living and BE­
ING GOOD. (46-47-48).
THOSE WHO DO. W ILL BE GREATLY BLESSED. RUT THOSE
WHO STILL RETAIN THE SOIL OF EVIL, W ILL BE UTTERLY
AND ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED as RELATED IN THE BOOK OF
REVELATION. _
AND THIS W ILL BE THE SECOND DEATH, spoken about in the
last book of the Bible. (49).
AND NOW, FAREW ELL, insofar as these Prophetic Letters are con­
cerned. We have been most happy to have been able to make this recerd
through your kind assistance, and we will open up the way for their
publication soon, in book form,—
IN ORDER THAT ALL MAY HAVE WARNING AND INSPIRA­
TION AND COURAGE TO FACE THE FUTURE. (42-43-44).

Supplemental
In starting my letter tonight, I want to talk seriously for a few min­

making for better living and working conditions in this
country.
BUT IT WILL BE ON A FALSE BASIS, and by the end of March 1940
or 1941, things will again become serious. Then the great war will begin
for all the earth and all the nations of the earth shall be gold worship­
pers, -AND THEY WILL FAIL. THEN, UNIVERSAL CHAOS WILL
COME, and THEN, FIGHTING BETWEEN NATIONS,-UNTIL THE
GREAT ROCK HITS.
So, during the artificially “good” times, dig in and prepare for the ter­
rible catastrophes to come. GET YOUR AFFAIRS AND MONEY IN
SHAPE TO BUY FOOD, PRINCIPALLY,-for after the war starts, it will
be THREE YEARS before the climatic conditions will permit the sow­
ing of seed and harvesting of crops.
Use your money and resources to provide for, and protect yourself
against, famine. FOR THERE WILL BE FAMINE AND GREAT SUF­
FERING and terrible calamities to the human race. Oh, my precious
one, DO BE PREPARED IN EVERY WAY, AND SEE TO IT THAT
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE ALSO PREPARED WITH FOOD AND
NECESSITIES. Please, my dearest one, take this advice seriously, for it
has been given me to pass on to you, by those same advanced and illum­
inated beings who gave us the preceeding Prophecy Letters.
SAVE YOUR DOLLARS WHEN THE GOOD TIMES COME ONCE
MORE, and lay in things that will keep, and so provide for your starva­
tion time. I know that you and yours will come through the tribulation
safely, if you only heed what I have just given you. I feel so happy, my

THE SEVENTEENTH LETTER
Supplemental

/ /
I want to tell you that I have contacted, again, those illuminated Be­
ings who gave us the Prophecy Letters; and they have informed and
shown me a picture that represents WORLD CHAOS FOR ABOUT
THREE WEEKS. A time of the greatest distress and confusion and
death, and smashing of established habits of personal and industrial life.
NOTHING IS TO REMAIN OF OUR PRESENT FORM OF CIV­
ILIZATION. Everything will be new and completely changed and start­
ed on a complete new basis constituting the REAL BROTHERHOOD
OF MAN. Then, a marvelous growth in all departments of life and so­
cial and commercial activity substantially as has already been given you
in the main body of the Prophecv Letters.
THE THREE WEEKS OF UTTER DESTRUCTION AND DESPAIR
will seem like a long time —but thev will end. and the sun and the moon
and the stars will come out again and shine, but
THE ASPECT OF THE HEAVENS W ILL BE COMPLETELY
CHANGED, as the earth will be tilted into a more upright position, by
the force of the Great Rock when it smites the earth and
THE POSITION OF ALL THE CONSTELLATIONS W ILL BE
“REMOVED” OR CHANGED, and so there will literally be brought in­
to being, “A new heaven and a new earth”—
as has been told by Peter
in the Bible III Pet. TTI. 10-131. As I told you before, THERE WILL
BE A WORLD WAR that will be fought bv devils, who will trv to de­
stroy all mankind,—
and when it is at its height, and the battling the most
awful,—
THEN WILL BE SIGHTED THE GRE AT ROCK COMING SWIFT­
LY TOWARD THE EARTH, AND TT W ILL BRTNG TERROR AND
INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION UPON THE WARRING PEOPLES,
and will fall directly upon the armies and absolutely annihilate them
all, and utterly destroy them all.
IT W ILL BRING GREAT CLIMATIC UPHEAVAL THAT WILL
54
L etters of Prophecy 55
NOT PERMIT CROPS TO GROW ANYWHERE UPON THE EARTH
—
and it will be THREE YEARS before the first harvest can be gath­
ered. So, again, I have been told to warn you to lay in food stuffs that
will sustain you and your friends for at least THREE YEARS.
DO THIS, AS SOON AS THE GREAT WAR STARTS, for it (the
war) will last over a year before the Great Rock comes, and food will
be high and scarce, after hostilities commence. If you follow this advice,
you and your friends will be protected. Oh, my precious one, please
take this seriously, for I know,—
I really and truiy KNOW that what I
have told you is God’s very own truth,—and that it has been passed
along for your own benefit and safety.
WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.

CONCLUSION
It will be a very easy and simple matter for any man or woman of
the events described in the foregoing Prophecy Letters, with the Bib­
lical Record, as presented in this book.
Read the letters with an open mind, keeping your Bible at your el-
average intelligence and mental honesty to synchronize for themselves

of solid ice, from being forced up into the Absolute Zero reaches of the
sky.
The descent of these huge globules would actually bring to pass the
prediction in the Book of Revelation concerning the “GREAT HAIL
OUT OF HEAVEN”—
every stone stated to be about the weight of a
talent, as set forth in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation, 21st verse.
The entire Book of Revelation, carefully studied in the light of these
illuminating and impressive Prophecy Letters, becomes entirely under­
standable.
With the coming of our Lord, will begin the reconstruction of life and
living on this Planet. A re-adjustment, a New Beginning, under the
most auspicious control and benevolent direction it is possible to im­
agine.
Those who remain alive will be brought under the regulation of a
moral and benign Autocracy, and given every opportunity to grow, ad­
vance and increase, during a thousand years.
It is asserted that many wise and illuminated beings will become
teachers of humanity, and that evil will not be tolerated in the world
for one thousand years,—
the period of the great Day of the Millenium./
At the end of the thousand years, evil will again be permitted to ap­
pear upon the earth for a brief season, in order to impress upon the
understanding and hearts of the people,—
the exceeding sinfulness of
sin. Also opportunity for those who have been evilly inclined to repent
and to turn away from the evil and lay hold upon that which is good,
will be given unto all who are to appear for JUDGMENT at the final
accounting. Either acceptance and eternal life and opportunity for ad­
vancement to obtain that perfect objective which is the will and pur­
pose of GOD,—
or eternal condemnation and annihilation of those who
permit the soil of evil to cling to them, will be the alternative.
THE SECOND DEATH spoken of in Revelation will be the FINAL
RECKONING of humanity, both in and out of the body. After this
JUDGMENT will come undreamed-of magnificence, progress and
achievement; unlimited opportunity for all of God’s creatures, until the
purpose for which the earth was created, shall have been fulfilled; and
it will, as related in the Bible, be destroyed to make way for “another
and larger and more advanced Solar System.” (See Twelfth Prophecy
Letter, closing paragraph.
A little further thought upon the results of the impact of so tremen-
58 T hy Kingdom C om e
dous a Celestial Projectile upon the earth will certainly bring with it
the attendant fire, the incineration of vast armies, the destruction of all
the cities of the world through the earthquake that cannot fail to be
felt in every portion of the globe. There will naturally be poisonous
gases, the pollution of the water in the Old World, the plague of dis­
ease .famine and death. The veiling of the sun, moon and stars, as pre­
viously described, and many other phenomena that a little meditation
will bring emphatically to view. The reasonableness of the predictions
made in Revelation, becomes instantly apparent.
The destruction of the ships, of great quantities of fish in the sea, and
the plague of stench. The sinking of great areas of Continental Europe
into the sea,—
or rather the sea running into the enormous depression
made, and the corresponding emergence of great submerged continents
in the Pacific Ocean, directly opposite the point of impact,—all are en­
tirely within the boundaries of reason and predictive sanity.
The more one carefully reads, digests, weighs and meditates upon
the statements contained in the Prophecy Letters, the more does the
Biblical record stand as being insistently and impressively and com-
pellingly TRUE.
If the times we are living in, hold terrible disasters and world-wide
destruction during the next decade,—
there is, nevertheless, cause for
great repoicing, for we know that Salvation and Deliverance are close
at hand, and that the “time of our redemption draweth nigh.”
Even though the night draws on, filled with noise, confusion and ter­
rifying calamities, still it is equally certain and absolutely dependable
that the dawn of a New and Better Day W ILL come, in which man­
kind will advance through brotherly love, cooperation and industry, to
heights of achievement impossible to even remotely imagine at the
present time.
May all of those into whose hands this book shall come, be comfort­
ed, forewarned and fully prepared. As the unseen communicator so in­
sistently says,—
“WATCH, AND PRAY, UNCEASINGLY.’

PART II
BIBLICAL APPENDIX
O * «
Inasmuch as many references are made in the Spirit­
ual Communications to the prophecies contained in the
Bible, it has seemed desirable that such portions of the
Biblical (which are the official and authoritative) ref­
erences to the great cataclysms and changes to come
upon the world — “in the latter days” — shall be set
forth in a place by themselves, and in such a manner
that they may be easily located, read and studied
systematically.
It is with this object in mind that the following Bib­
lical Appendix has been carefully prepared and present­
ed. The numbers appearing in the text of the Spiritual
Communications in the fore part of this book, apply to
the numbered paragraphs in this Biblical Appendix, and
show how perfectly these communications “tie in” with
the present conditions and indications developing in the
world with those momentous Prophesies focused upon
our own time, and upon the early distant future.
Wherever numbers are encountered in the text of the
Prophecy Letters in the first half of this book, it will be
very simple to turn to the Biblical Appendix, find the
corresponding number, and read what the Bible has to
say concerning the matter.
Only the most important and salient references are
given here. It is recommended that the chapters in their
entirety be carefully read and studied, with the abridged
extracts and references contained in the following pages
as a guide.

THE BOOK OF ISAIAH
* * *
Prophecy is only history written in advance. Isaiah may be considered
as the Dean of Bible Historians in this sense, with a greater penetration
and out-reaching vision covering his own time and the “time of the end”
in which we are now living, and soon to pass on into and through the
material and spiritual regeneration that forms so important and insistent
a theme in the work of all the Inspired Writers. Isaiah was born about
765 B. C., and no greater man of his calling succeeded him, up to the
advent of our Saviour.
He seems to have been specially favored with a pre-view concerning
the condition of our day, and with the possible exception of Daniel, no
other prophet has been so voluminous in his record of God’s purposeful ;
conclusions. He begins a distinctive period that ends with the birth of
Our Lord, comprehending and vividly portraying this special period, as
well as the first coming and ministry of the Savior, and continuing on
into the NOW, with the denouement of this age and its hypocrisies
clearly stated.
Isaiah was the first of the major prophets. He lived during the reign
of Uzziah, king of Judah, and his labors extended to the time of Heze-
kiah, a period of approximately twenty-five years. He is called the
Evangelical Prophet, or the Prophet of Bedemption.
Readers of the Prophecy Letters should searchingly study and com­
pare them and their disclosures with the “advance history” set forth in
the writings of Isaiah. Students will be greatly impressed with the de­
scription of our own times and can profitably synchronize them with
the Biblical statements, of Isaiah and those that follow him.

3. And many people shall go and say, Come ye and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob: and he
will teach us his waps, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion
shall go forth the law, and the word of the law from Jerusalem.

Christ’s rule, after the great destruction has taken place.)

ISAIAH LXV: 17-25
(In this chapter Isaiah tells us of the pastoral tranquility of humanity
under God’s rule, after re-construction and progress are well under
way. It blends perfectly with the picture embodied in the Prophecy Let­

17. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former

19. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall be heard no more in her, nor the voice of cry­

20. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man

21. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant
vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
22. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and

23. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble: for they
are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.
24. And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and
while they are yet speaking I will hear.
25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
straw like the bullock; and the dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.

Isaiah, which bear with special emphasis upon the matter contained in
the remarkable Prophecy Letters).

THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH
Jeremiah was the son of Hilkash, a priest of Anathoth. It was in the
thirteenth year of Josiah, king of Judah, that the “word of the Lord”
came to him. He was contemporary with the four prophets, Zephaniah,
Habakkuk, Ezekiel and Daniel.
This book is greatly lacking in systematic arrangements, and often
creates uncertainty or confusion when read in the order in which it is
given. However, a searching perusal of this book discloses a far for-
66 T h y K in g d o m C o m e
ward looking vision of our present day, which any reader can easily dis­
cern for himself.
We shall, however, quote only two verses from the sixth chapter,—
the 13th and 14th.

TH E PROPHECY OF EZEKIEL
There is no trustworthy record of his early history, except that he was
the son of Buzi, the priest. From the many instances recorded of the
elders inquiring of him as to the divine messages he had received, it is
evident he held a commanding position in the Jewish colony of captives
taken from Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachin, and to whom he must
have been a great comfort. While the last visions of Ezekiel are referred
to by the Book of Revelation, there is no actual quotation from this pro­
phecy in the New Testament. His vision of the time of the end, so per­
fectly synthesizes with the vision of the other prophets and with the
description found in the Book of Revelation, that it is appropriate to
give it here, for purposes of study and comparison. It will be found in
the thirty-eighth chapter, eighteenth to twenty-third verses, inclusive:

THE PROPHESIES OF DANIEL
Daniel belonged to the Persian and Chaldean periods. It is assumed
that he was born in Jerusalem and carried into captivity to Babylon when
a child. He saw Babylon rise in power and magnificence to be the first
of the world empires, and then its decline and subjugation by Persia.
Daniel is one of the noblest and most inspiring characters of the Bible.
The book was written partly in Hebrew and partly in the Chaldaic lan­
guages. It is called the Apocalypse of the Old Testament. Daniel is the
prophet of the Gentiles and their times. It is apropos that he should be
divinely inspired and appointed to see and record the prophetical visions
involving the four world civilizations— the Oriental, Hellenism, Imper­
ialism,— and Commercial (or Industrialism) of which we are today a
part.
It should be borne in mind in reading the Bible, that the word “Bab­
ylon” not only applies to the great city in Daniel’s time, to the country
and civilization of his day,— but also to the great system of greed and
exploitation exemplified in our present civilization in whicn greed for
gold and selfsh cruelty and wickedness is as rampant as it ever has been
inthe history of the world.
The first reference in the Prophecy Letters to the Bible, relates to the
Fall of the Great Rock, “as set forth in the Book of Daniel.” For our
purposes, however, we shall omit much of what is interesting and appli­
cable, condensing the most salient and direct events that synchronize
w
ith the “time of the end” in which we are now living. The entire book
of Daniel is worth serious and conscientious study and analysis.
68 T hy Kingdom Com e
THE BOOK OF DANIEL
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the time of Daniel, had a dream
that troubled him greatly,— “wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his
sleep brake from him.” His great concern was caused by his inability to
recall the dream which had left such a terrifying impression upon his
consciousness.
The king called all of his astrologers, soothsayers, magicians and wise
men of the kingdom before him, and demanded that they should tell
him of his vision and interpret its meaning to him. This upon pain of
death should, they refuse to do so.
All this most interesting account, may be read in the second chapter
of Daniel. The decree shortly went forth that all the wise men should
be slain, for none there were who were able to tell the king his dream
or interpret it for him; and they sought Daniel and his fellows, that the
king’s sentence might also be carried out upon them.
Daniel then took counsel with Arioch. the captain of the king’s guard
m charge of the squad of executioners and asked that the king should
delay a little in the execution of the sentence of death, saying he would,
with God’s power, tell the king his dream, and interpret it for him.
The account bearing upon the matter contained in the Prophecy Let­
ters, is recorded, principally, in the second chapter of Daniel commenc-
ig with the twenty-fifth verse, which is reproduced:
o • •
DANIEL II: 25-45
25. Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will
make known unto the king the interpretation.
26. The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belte-
shazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have
seen, and the interpretation thereof?
27. Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret
which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the
magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;
28. But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy
dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these.
29. As for thee, O king, thv thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed,
Biblical Appendix 69
what should come to pass hereafter-, and he that revealeth secrets mak-
eth known to thee what shall come to pass.
30. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that
I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known
the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts
of thy heart.
31. Thou, O king, sawest, and beheld a great image. This great image,
whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form there­
of was terrible. '
32. This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and arms of silver,
his belly and his thighs of brass,
33. His legs of iron, his feet part iron and part clay.
REFERENCE 17: Daniel 2: 34-43.
34. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
smote the image upon the feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them
to pieces.
35. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, brok­
en to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer thresh­
ing floors; and the wind carried them away that no place was found for
them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and
filled the whole earth.
36. This is the dream-, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
the king.
37. Thou, 0 king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath giv­
en thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
38. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field
and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath
made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
39. And after thee shall arise another king inferior to thee, and another
third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
40. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh
all these, it shall break in pieces and bruise.
41. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter’s clay,
and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in
it of the strength of iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with
m
iry clay.
42. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so
the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

43. And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave on
e
to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

44. And in the days of these kings shall the God of Heaven set up a
kingdom, which shall never he destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.
45. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone ivas cut out of the mount­
ain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the
clay, the silver and the gold; and the great God hath made known unto
the king What shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain and
the interpretation thereof sure.

REFERENCE 19: Daniel 12: 1-4. 8-13.
1. And at that time shall Michael stand up, and the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of
trouble, such as never has beep since there was,, a nation even to that
same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one
that shall be found written in the book.
2. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall aw&ke,
some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
3. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firma­
ment; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and
ever.
4. But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to
the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.
8. And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what
shall be the end of these things?
9. And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and
sealed till the time of the end.
10. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked
shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand: but the
wise shall understand.
11. And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,

inthy lot at the end of the days.
THE PROPHECY OF JOEL
# * #
The prophet Joel is another of the Inspired Writers of the Old Testa­
ment who nad a clear vision of the “time of the end.” His vision is co­
incidental with, and overlaps into, the close up punishment visited by
God upon the people of his time. The book of Joel contains only three
chapters, and is well worth a critical and thoughtful reading in its en­
tirety, with modern conditions as a frame or setting. For our purposes,
however, we shall give only a few extracts, arranged suitably but not
consecutively. These quotations seem to bear with special emphasis upon
the tilings contained in the letters in the fore part of this book. Also upon
those other prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation.

THE PROPHECY OF MICAH
This prophet lived in Moresheth, in southwest Judah near the Phil­
istine border. He prophesied during the time of Jotham, Abaz and Heze-
kiah of Judah, and was contemporary with Isaiah- also Hosea and Amos
of Israel. It was by this prophet that Judah learned where the Messiah
shoidd be born. It will be recalled that Herod inquired of the priests
where the Christ should be born, and they referred him to this prophecy.
This prediction of Christ’s nativity was spoken 700 years before that
event. Micah sets forth the basis of confidence on the one hand, and the
B iblical Appendix 16
our purposes, we shall reproduce the first five verses of the fourth
chapter.

MICAH IV: 1-5
1. But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the

it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
2. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to
the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; »md he
will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall
go forth of Zion- and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
3. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke nations afar off;
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more.
4. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts
hath spoken it.
5. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we
will walk in the name of the Lord our God, for ever and ever.
THE PROPHECY OF ZEPHANIAH
Zephaniah was the prophet of royal descent. He flourished during the
reign of Josiah, probably just prior to the religious reforms instituted
by that king. While he does not mention the Messiah directly, much of
what he says is applicable with conspicuous clarity to the present con­
ditions in which we find ourselves. We reproduce part of the first chap­
ter, from the fourteenth to the eighteenth verses inclusive.

THE PROPHECY OF ZECHARIAH
Zechariah assumed his prophetic office in the second year of the reign
of Darius, (B. C. 520) almost immediately after the call of Haggai. The
Messianic Prophesies are written into the 12th and 14th chapters, which
are worth careful study in their entirety. For our purposes, however, we

THE PROPHECY OF MALACHI
O O O
Malachi is the last of the prophets contemporaneous with Nehemiali
and the last of the Old Testament historians. His name signifies in the
Hebrew, “my angel”. The word signifies “messenger”. The last word
of the Old Testament is a description of the Messiah who will yet tarry
for four hundred years. But looking out far beyond the first ministry of
our Lord, he clearly envisions the time of the end when our Savior shall
come into full possession of His kingdom, as given in the fourth chapter:
first, second and third verses:

WHAT OUR LORD. HIMSELF, HAD TO SAY CONCERNING THE
TIME OF HIS SECOND COMING, AND THE
SIGNS ATTENDING IT
$ * *
Matthew, Mark, and Luke devote a great deal of space in their re­
spective Gospels concerning the Second coming of our Lord, and quote
him most lucidly and impressively upon this great event that has been
so long resident in the “future” but which is merging very rapidly into
the present. Any study of the Prophecy Letters should be supplemented
with a most careful and searching reading of ALL that these three great
Reporters of Christ and His teaching and Time have to say.
There can be no greater authority than the words of Jesus, Himself,
and we may be very sure that events which are now rapidly shaping
in the world, will bring into utter and complete objectification all of
B iblical Appendix 77
those things concerning the Second Coining, and of the Judgment, to
be visited upon the world.
Those who wish to acquaint themselves' fully with all our Lord is
reported to have given concerning these times, and the second advent,
are referred to the following selections which tell fully and completely
the story in its entirety:
MATTHEW: XXVI: 4-25.
MATTHEW: XXIV: 27-44.
LUKE: XVII: 26-36.
LUKE: XXI: 25-36.
LUKE: XXI: 8-25.
MARK: XIII: 5-23.
MARK: XIII: 24-37.
MATTHEW: XXV: 31-46.
These references are all recommended to the serious study and med­
itation of the reader. For our own purposes, however, we shall draw from
Matthew XXIV: 27-44, which gives a very clear and unmistakable ac­
count in our Lord’s own words.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL
TO THE THESSALONIANS
• • •
The Apostle Paul was fully informed regarding the Second Coming of
Our Lord ,as is proven in his first epistle to the Thessalonians. His epistle
gives us very essential instruction on one of the greatest subjects of the
Bible. During his labors at Thessalonica, Paul undoubtedly instructed
these people regarding the Second Coming of our Lord. It was a mis­
understanding of these teachings that led many of them to cease work
and live in expectation of an immdiate advent. It was to correct these
impressions that this First Epistle was written while Paul was working
at his trade of tent-making in Corinth. This document is the first of the
Pauline epistles and was written about A. D. 52. Thessalonica was so
named by Cassander in honor of his wife Thessalonica, the sister of Al­
exander the Great. It is now called Salonika. For purposes of condensa­
tion and ready reference we reproduce portions of the fourth and fifth
chapters.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TIMOTHY

Timothy was the beloved disciple of Paul. It is the first of Paul’s pas­
toral letters written to two individuals: Timothy and Titus from Mac­
edonia; probably about A. D. 65 a short time prior to his death, which
occurred about three years later. i
In his comunication to Timothy, the great apostle conveys to this, our
time and generation, a marvelous picture of the ’‘latter times”; giving
additional weight to the important theme of the Second Coming of our
Lord. We quote three verses appearing in the fourth chapter:

iron;
3. Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, winch
God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe
and know the truth.
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TIMOTHY
Again Paid brings into remembrance the wickedness of the last days,
and describes the enemies of truth. Under the tyrant Nero, who mur­
dered his own mother, Paul is about to be put to death. He realizes that
his end is near, yet his opproaching dissolution could not prevent his
throwing additional light upon the Second Coming, giving a most faith­
fully startling picture of our present times and difficulties. We quote
eight verses, beginning with the Third chapter: •

AT THE SECOND COMING
« O *
In His talks with His Disciples, as He was wont to do, and having in
mind what Jesus had just said concerning a rich man who “shall hardly
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven”, — Peter, pondering upon the mat­
ter, asked the Lord what he and the other disciples would get out of
leaving all and following the Master, saying to the Lord, “Behold, we
have forsaken all and followed thee: what shall we have therefore?” The
answer of the Lord was most significant and so perfectly synchronizes
with the statements given in the Prophecy Letters that it must not be
omitted. It follows, as given in the 19th chapter of Matthew, 28th verse,

The date of this epistle has been placed as early as A. D. 44 and as

their general character and were written for the body of believers and
not for churches or individuals. In it we find much that pertains to our
present times and tribulation. We quote the first eight verses of chapter
five, and the sixteenth verse, also.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE HEBREWS
O * *
There is some difference of opinion among scholars as to whether the
authorship of this great letter should be ascribed to Paul or to others.
The language and system of reasoning is so characteristic, however,
that it is generally conceded to be the work of Paul. If so, it must have
been written shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem, (A. D. 70) or
before A. D. 68, because it was in the year or shortly after, that Paul
suffered Martyrdom. In it he speaks of the NEW COVENANT which is
to be established under Christ’s rule. Let us refer to the salient verses
found in the eighth chapter.
HEBREWS VIII: 6-13
REFERENCE NO. 43: Hebrews 8: 6-9
6. But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much

. For if that first Covenant had been faidtless, then should no place
have been sought for the second.
S
. For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith
th
eLord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Judah:
9
. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in thq
d
aywhen I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;

continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not,

after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and
write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shat]
be to me a people: i
11. And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man
his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least
unto the greatest.
12. For 1 will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
their iniquities will I remember no more.

THE SECOND EPISTLE GENERAL OF .PETER
© © ©
Although the style is so different in this epistle, from that of the first
letter bearing his name, the personality so strongly reflects Peter, that
there is no doubt either he wrote the document or that another hand
performed the service for him concerning the first epistle, the style of
which is greatly improved over the present writing. It is thought to have
been written shortly before Peter’s death, hence not later than A. D. 68.
It must be memembered that Peter was standing in the midst of scoffers,
mockers and false teachers who denied the Second coming of Christ.
What Peter has to say, therefore, under such conditions, applies directly
and with serious emphasis to the times and conditions obtaining in the
“las‘ days.” We draw upon the third chapter, reproducing it in its en­
tirety.

II PETER III: 1-8
REFERENCE NO. 45: II Peter 3: 1-12.
1. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I
stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
2. That ye be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the
holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord
and Savior: ■
3. Knowing this first, that there shall com e in the last days, scoffers,
walking after their own lusts.
4. And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.
5. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
water: i
6. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water
perished,
7. But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word,
are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.
8. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand vears one day.
9. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness, but is long suffering to usward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance.
10. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
ivhich the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are there­
in shall be burned up. ■
11. Seeing then that these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.
12. Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God where­
in the heavens on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat?
REFERENCE NO. 46: II Peter 3: 13-18.
13. Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens
and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. ,
14. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be dil-
B ib l ic a l A p p e n d ix 87
igent that ye be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.
15. And account that the long suffering of our Lord is salvation; even
as our beloved brother Paul also according,to the wisdom given unto
him
, hath written you;
16. As also in his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which
are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own
destruction.
17. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
lest ye, also, being led away with error of the wicked, fall from your
steadfastness. i
18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever, Amen.
THE PROPHECIES IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION
It was in Patmos, a barren island in the Aegean sea, to which John
had been banished, where he received these transcendently celestial vis­
ions, the greatest of all visions recorded in the Bible. There is some dif­
ference of opinion as to the date. Tradition places their authorship in
the reign of Domitian who carried on a general persecution of the Christ­
ians, A. D. 81-96.
Revelation is sometimes called the Apocalypse. This is the Greek
title, and signifies removing the veil. There is, perhaps, no book in the
Bible that is approached with more uncertainty. Many feel that no at­
tempt should be made to understand it, which is a great mistake.
The entire book deals with the first and second judgments that shall
come upon the world in the great day of the Lord. Conditions are clear­
ly described depicting terrifying scenes of destruction, tribulation, con­
fusion and darkness, of wickedness and hypocrisy, all foreseen by the
prophets of old and clearly emphasized by our Lord, Himself, which will
be utterly destroyed and a “new heaven and a new earth” shall emerge
in which'justice, equity and brotherly love shall endure during the thous­
and year Millenial Day.
The entire book should be carefully, thoughtfully, seriously and search-
ingly read by all those who are anxious to discover the truth concerning
our present times, and the immediate future. More especially those par­
ticular portions which are reproduced in the following pages. These won­
derful visions are stupendous “history written in advance” held in abey-
88 T hy Kingdom C om e
ance for centuries and now, at last, about to be uncovered and made
manifest to all.
It is remarkable how the statements contained in the ,Prophecy Letters,
like a clear white beam from a powerful searchlight, seem to be focused
upon the statements contained in Revelation, and make them clear and
understandable.
It would appear that there are to be two judgments of mankind, the
first one to be the destruction of our “modern” civilization, by the fall of
the Great Back. Those who remain alive are to form the,nucleus for a
new civilization that will grow and advance to undreamed of splendor,
during the next thousand years, under the personal direction, leadership
and command of our Lord and Savior, who will come to earth speedily
for that purpose. With him, as stated in the Prophecy Letters, will come
the twelve apostles who will become twelve judges of humanity during
the Millenium, under the most benevolent but firm direction of tha
Christ Authority. (See Matthew: XIX: 28).
At the end of the thousand years there will be another brief period of
chaos permitted, immediately following which all souls will appear for
judgment, the final judgment, receiving either complete forgiveness be­
stowed upon the repentant who voluntarily accept the good and repent of
the evil, carrying with it eternal life,— or final condemnation of the evil
doers who willfully choose that way, with consequent complete anni­
hilation. This is the “second death” from which there will be no further
resurrection, pardon or recall.
The twentieth chapter of Revelation seems to have special bearing up­
on these things, and is reproduced herewith:

REVELATION XX: 1-15

1. And. I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key to the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
2. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil,
and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.
3. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled; and after that he must be loosed a little season.
4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
unto them: (the thrones of the twelve apostles?) and I saw the souls of
them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of

5. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
were finished. This is the first resurrection.
6. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on such
the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and
Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. ,
7. And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out
of his prison, i
8. And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quar­
ters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them to battle: the number
of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city, and fire came down out
of heaven and devoured them.
10. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tor­
mented day and night for ever and ever. ;
11. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on' it, from whose
face the earth and heaven fled away; and there was found;no place for

12. And I saw the dead, great and small, stand before God; and the
Books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of
life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in

(NOTE: With reference to the “ great hail out of heaven” mentioned in
the last verse abovej one can easily understand that part of so large a
planetoid falling into the sea would, having the terrific force of gravity
behind it, cause a spout of water to ascend to such great height into
the absolute Zero-cold regions of the sky--that when it fell to earth
again, it would be in the shape of great chunks of. ice that would do
terrible damage to life and property. Water being forced so far up into
94 T hy Kingdom Com e
the vastness of the sky would, meeting the Zero-cold, be converted into
ice when it started its return to earth,—and thus could be brought into
exact fulfillment the account in Revelation of the “ Great Hail out of
Heaven.” The immensity of these chunks of ice, and the terrific force
with which they will bombard the earth on their return, can better be
imagined than described.

THE IMAGE GOVERNMENT
THE END TIM E
At no time in the history of mankind, have the signs foreshadowing
the “Time of the End” so often spoken of in the Bible, >by practically
every prophet from Isaiah to Malachi in the Old Testament and by.the
writers of the New Testament,—
been so insistent and portentous w
ith
menacing chaos as■
they are today. Only recently, within the last twenty
years, have the conditions in the world been such as to correspond w
ith
the tribulation of the people, and th e;turning away from the truth to
worship fables. We are now beginning to understand the condition rap­
idly taking shape in the earth, which will, at any moment, release the
Red Horse of Communism and the Rlack Horse of Fascism to work their
prophetic havoc in the world. ■
The whole civilization is in a turmoil of envy, suspicion, fear, greed,
insanity for power and authority that 'regiments individuals and makes
serfs of them more truly than ever ancient despot enslaved his people.
The daily papers carry dispatches clearly indicating -the present confu­
sion in the world, men’s hearts “Failing them for fear of those things that
are coming”, the wind'and the sea roaring, earthquakes, material, moral
and spiritual temblors taking place everywhere, men and women deny­
ing there is a God, as in Russia, while in Germany the head of the State
is held up to the understanding of the people as their deity. In'Italy,
boys and girls of tender age are put under military discipline -when they
ought to be at play. The armament race is running wild and thousands
of'millions of dollars are being feverishly borrowed and spent for guns,
ships- weapons of annihilation, airplanes, poison gas- and the implements
of utter destruction. Millions of men are kept idle under arms, and their
productive power;smothered, while those who labor to support them are
groaning under the burdens of taxation and hardship never before ex­
perienced in the history of the world. Nations are recklessly adding to
their insolvency; and hastening the chaotic denouement exactly as proph­
esied over two thousand years ago. The nations of the world are bankrupt.

The United States announces its purpose to have a Navy second to
none, prepares a great hole in the ground and buries fifteen thousand
million dollars in gold in it. Truly the time of the end is close at hand,
and although “mens hearts are failing them” looking upon the sinister
shaping of events, still there are other hearts watching and praying that
the fore-ordained purposes of God may swiftly take effect and the “new
heaven |and the new earth” may come speedily into being.
Never before have the nations of the world so clearly combined the de­
fiant strength of iron, with the weak clay of arrogant nationalism in their
armed despotism, jealous hatred and unnatural fear.

For nearly two thousand years humanity has been “expecting” the
Second Coming of our Lord. The Bible is the only authority from which
we may draw inspiration, hope and information regarding this great
event. It is full of references pointing to the New Dispensation and the
“times” just preceeding and following the Great Tribulation and the last
universal battle of Armageddon. One finds many references to the “time
of the end” that are difficult of interpreation by a layman, and even by
those who have had special opportunities to study and understand Holy
Writ authoritatively. Those who have ventured to do so, are largely at
variance with each other, and there has always been more or less ob­
scurity. We have been given full information in the writings of the
prophets of Isaiah to Revelation, as has been set forth in the Appendix
to this volume. No one has, as yet, so far as known, gathered together
into one place ATT, of the references and statements given in the Bi­
ble, focussing upon the Time of the End,such as has been drawn to­
gether in this Appendix.
And yet there are many obscure items and" matters hard to understand
— many questions that must be answered clearly and unequivocally, be­
fore a proper light can be shed upon this chiefest event— the SECOND
COMING of our Lord.
When does the Times of the Gentiles really end? What is the mean­
ing of the “seven times” mentioned in the Bible? What is meant by a
“Time, Times and Half a Time?” How or in what way is the terrible
image seen by the prophet Daniel, with the Head of Gold and the Feet
of Iron and mirey clay, synchronized with these “times” or with the great
98 T hy K ingdom C om e
Bear beast of Daniel 7:5, or the Leopard Beast of 7:6 or the Terrible
Beast of Daniel 7:7 or the Little Horn Empire of Daniel 7:25 or the
Polluted Sanctuary Era,— or the Prophecy Epoch, or the Waiting Era?
What unvarying and accurate basis of time measurement have w
e
with which to reach into the past, and focus the prophetic fulfillment
upon our own day? How are we able to separate the truth from the false?
All these and many more questions arise to baffle the Bible students,
especially those who “specialize” on the Time of the End, the Second
Coming and the New Dispensation immediately following.
Perhaps there is no one more fully qualified to turn the light of under­
standing upon these questions and uncertainties than Mr. A. L. Garber,
foi over fifty years publisher of “THE PROPHETIC AGE”, at Ashland,
Ohio. We have, therefore, asked and received permission from him to
draw upon his written studies on this highly specialized branch of sacred
roseaich and to him, both the reader and the editor of this volume are
highly indebted.
Let us, therefore, examine all these questions under the guidance of
his understanding of these things, synchronizing them in our own minds
with what has already been given in the Prophecy Letters themselves,
and in the Biblical Appendix. There is always an unspeakable satisfaction
that comes from the assurance of doubts fully met and the consciousness
of the truth, that always sets one free,— free from ignorance and dark- ,
ness. Let Mr. Garber tell his own story, from this pom*.

The concerned will ask to know when the coming war in the U. S. will
be if there must be one more? The answer is in the ending of the Gentile
Times. This table covers the Seven Times, from the epoch of 40 years
of beginning and the 40 years of ending. The table is the lesult of ast­
ronomical and chronological study since 1875 by different men and, let it
be said they were actuated by the Spirit, to give to this generation real
knowledge for these last days.
“The Gentile Times” is the epoch of Seven Times which is 2520 solar
years, assigned by the Lord as punishment of the Israel people for their
failure to obey his laws. The dream image of Dan. 2:38 with the head
of gold and the Lion Beast of Dan. 7:4 were the Babylon of King Neb­
uchadnezzar. The prophecy epoch was 90 years, 3376 to 3466, A. M. ,—
B. C. 533 with 40 years of conquest to supremacy, to 3416. The Seven
T he I mage Government 99
Times, the 2520 years, which fully end the lease of supreme Gentile gov­
ernment in the earth, end in 5963 A. M.,— 1938 A. D.
The Bear Beast of Dan. 7:5 was the Persian Empire. The prophecy
epoch was 303 years, 3667 to 3970 A. M. — B. C. 28.
The Terrible Beast of Dan. 7:7 was Dragon Rome and Beast Rome.
The prophecy epoch was 666 years, 3970 to 4636 A. M.,— B. C. 28 to
638 A. D.
The Little Horn Empire, of Dan. 7:25 was the Mohammedan era. The
prophecy epoch was 1260 years. 4636 to 5896 A. M.,—
638 to 1898 A. D.
The Polluted Sanctuary Era, Dan. 8: 13-14. The prophet epoch is 2300
years, 3670 to 5970 A. M .-B. G. 330 to 1972 A. D.
The Gentile Times, Dan. 12:7. The prophecy epoch is 2520 years. 3376
to 5896 A. M.,-—-623 B. C. to 1898 A. D. With 40 years to complete ful­
ness of time to 1938 Two divisions of times, times and a half, 1260 years,
centered on 638 A. D., seven times which is 2520.
The Abomination Mohammedan Era. Dan. 7:25 and 12:11. The proph­
ecy epoch is 1290 day years, 4636 to 5926 A. M.,—
638 to 1929 A. D.
The Waiting Era, Dan. 12:12. The prophecy epoch is 1335 day years,
4636 to 5971 A. M., -638 to 1973 A. D.
The Waiting ends with the settled administration of the Kingdom of
the Son of Man discerned in Daniel standing in his lot.
The Lord is faithfully keeping his pledge to the Gentile rulers, and
their rights and age fully end in September 1939, at which time a Jubilee
year begins. i
In September 1940. the 70th Jubilee epoch begins and it becomes the
eternal Right of Jesus, the Son of Man, to begin taking up national gov­
ernment over the earth.
Six thousand years of moon time ended 1870 A. D. 6000 years of mean
time ends in 1940, and 6000 vears of solar time ends in 2002 A. D.
The insanity life of king Nebuchadnezzar was ended by a glorious re­
turn to reason and honor to the Most High and he pronounced a proc­
lamation with eloquence that reverberates even to the present.
The fall and end of the present Babylon is just as sure to come as did
the warning of the hand writing on the wall of Belshazzar’s feast room in
the day of Daniel in which a thousand of his officials gathered to drink
wine and be merry.
As a conclusion to this matter, turn to the 5th chapter of Daniel and
notice how wonderfully the Lord overruled Babylon 2520 years ago, and
embrace the truth that the same Lord and God, by the Son of Man is
. ff

ruling the nations of the earth today as they are allowed to fill the cup
of iniquity ready for the national plagues and the filling of her own cup
she hath filled double for her, with the decree She shall drink.

Genesis 1:14—
And God said let luminaries be in the expanse of the
heavens to divide between the day and (between) night; and let them
be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.—
Literal translation.
Bible seasons, Bible epochs and Bible ages are measured by the plan­
ets, God has created and set in their orbits.
The planets do not measure time precisely day by day, month by
month and year by year- but there is a slowing down and a speeding up
that in cycles are absolutely accurate and in general harmony.
There are several lines of time that astronomically measure the years
and epochs of passing time.
The Solar cycle, measured by Sunday being the first day of the year
and the week of seven days is a fundamental factor in all the dealings
by God with his creation of Man. The great sentinels of the skies keep
seven day periods with scientific accuracy and this should arouse in man­
kind continued reverence for the Sabbath day which God sanctified and
blessed.
The Metonic cycle of 19 years is a measure of time. Seven of these
cycles are 133 years and is a useful measure.
Mercury and Venus are two stars that abide within the orbit of the
earth and their transits are sure.
A set of Mercury transits cover 92 years; that is, the series of transits
are passed and begin anew. Venus requires 486 years, and the long time
makes it the safest measure of all past time back to Adam when the his­
tory of Man began.
The history and records made by men contain errors and a moon mea­
sure of 19 years or a Mercury measure of 92 years may be missed or
added and thus; put errors in comparison with the dates of human his­
tory. The liability in periods of 486 years being added or deducted in
comparing with Bible and human history is not at all likely.

The table made by Venus is a marvel of simplicity; so simple that
learned men don’t care to exploit it, as there is little show of superior at-
i tainment. They prefer to fumble with confusing figures that never prove
' anything that they may make a show of learning.
The table which follows is the basis of correct prophetic chronology.
The years are all in it. The great task for men is to assign the events of
history to the proper years. Because no standard scale has been adopted
encyclopedias are spotted, with mistakes and no rule of correction has
existed. Knowledge of the Venus transit periods has been known for
hundreds of years but no one used it; a simple table of it is of a few
inches of print, authorized and declared in a message from God in 33
words.
The table of the team transits of the Star Venus is printed to show the
age of Adam life on the Earth.
One point of assurance on passing time is the Sabbatic year, which is
every seventh. Divide 5934 bv seven and you get 847 and a remainder.
Add 2 years to 5934 and you have 848 even; so it is a Sabbatic year and
1938. The A. D. years are I year and 9 months out of harmony with the
Solar Time. The Israel era began with Moses and the years begin* and
end near April 1st.
The transit teams of the star Venus is an infallible evidence of the
approximate age of the earth and when considered with the chronology of
the patriarchs presented in the Bible fixes the age of Man’s existence on
the earth, and no mistake. Study them carefully and become settled on
that subject.
A team of the transits of Venus covers a period of 486 years, a time
long enough that a little mistake in history or count, will not become an
element of confusion. A team of the transits proceed in the following
manner, being eight in number and then repeat:
In astronomical years— 8,121, 8,106, 8,121, 8.106— 486.
A short span period passed from 1874 to 1882. Many of the young now
living will never see a transit of Venus while the old have lived through
two of them.
The transits of 1874 and 1882 were a repetition of the transits Adam
passed in 40 and 48 A. M. Twelve times the transits of 1874 and 1882
have been repeated, and the thirteenth repetition will come in 2360 to
2368 A. D.

Learned men have floundered about in
The Era of the Olympiads
The Era of Rome,
The Nabonasson Era,
The Byzantine Era,
The Julian Periods,
And others.
There is a list of calendars that have added to the confusion because
ambitious men sought to emblazon their names on the wings of time.
Julius Caesar named a month after himself, the calendar July- and Caesar
Augustus, not to be less conspicuous, followed with August, and as there
were no more spare days, he took another from February to make 31.
The. Jews carry their special calendar which is about 238 years short
of true time, dating from the time when men began to call on the name
of the 1,ord. in the days cf Seth and Enos. Gen. J;26 and 5, 3, 6.
The Kingdom Age will have a new simplified calendar, likely of 28
days to the month and the month beginning with Sunday and ending
with Saturday, with 13 months to the year. This would make necessary a
leap week about every six years- in place of the leap day of February 29.
The Bible creation year begins on the Sunday nearest the 19th of the
calendar month cf September. The sun was creatd on the fourth day. The
sun begins the day and the first day of the week called Sunday is the ap­
propriate lime to begin the year, the Anno Mundi year.
No spiritual obligation is wrapped up in these calculations, but an
understanding is valuable in grasping the right viewpoint of the periods
of prophecy that the wise and pious may understand what will come to
T he I mage Government 103
pass among the nations of the earth as the second coming of Jesus ap­
proaches.
Little do the people comprehend the power or meaning of much the
Lord has spoken. The planetary measure of the times and seasons have
not failed. Even a line of patriarchs, priests and kings has been kept
intact from Adam to the present king of England, who is expected to
pass it to Jesus.
The testimony of history for thousands of years shows that man can not
change the operation of the planets nor the purposes of God in the dis­
posal of his power over the nations and pepole. What has been foretold
must come to pass.
The eighth beast which is of the seven is executing his acts to com­
plete the Gentile Epoch and his supporters of ten kings will perform
their acts in the last groat play.
The two years, 1937 and 1938, will decide under the vision of Bible
prophecy whether the Kingdom of Jesus will settle on the nations or
whether a developing period is to make them ready for the great day
of peace.
There are two periods of prophecy which stand out as two lone
witnesses, to be completed, the 2300 days of Dan. 8:14 land the 1335 days
of Dan. 12:12. The first will end in 1972 and the other in 1973.
The great key date of prophetic periods is the River of Daniel, Chapter
12, being 638 A. D.—
4636 A. M. This may at first seem to carry little
of importance, but it represents the middle of the two great epochs of
the seven times of the punishment of Israel because the kingdom re­
fused to obey the commands .and statutes given them by the Lord. The
two periods are 1260 years each given in the words of time, times and a
half.
The term is to some extent relative, and may be more than 1260 years,
to include 30 to 40 years of transition. There were 1260 years from 638
A. D. to 1898. No very notable events marked that year, besides the
Spanish American war and the German Kaiser’s march into Jerusalem
in his deal to later become the Great King.
Babylon was 40 years in reaching a crisis in 3416, over Jerusalem.
The chronology of the old time Bibles we have gives the year of the
Exodus of Egypt as before Christ 1491. The Moslem conquest of Jeru­
salem was in 638 A. D. Add the two and the sum is 2129 years from the
Exodus to the Moslem conquest. The Exodus was in 2513 A. M. (year
of the world war). The Moslem Era began in 4636 A. M. Subtract 2513
from 4636 and you have 2123. This proves there is an error of 6 in the B.
104 T hy K ingdom C om e
C. and A. D. sum. Count off 2 years as an allowance in splicing the two.
there remains still an error of 4 years.'Another summing is this— in 3376
A. M. the times of the Gentiles began. The historical B. C. year is 622.
The same old Bible gives 33 A. D. as the year of the crucifixion. 622 and
33 are 655. 4027 less 3376 leaves 651. Here is a difference of 4 years
too many.
The only absolute, unchangeable measures of time are the evening,
night and morning day, the week of seven days and the cycles of planets.
Now, as never before, it is urgent to watch, under the command of
Jesus. Matt. 24:42. Mark 13:35. Luke 21:36.
There remains yet 64 years (from 1938) to complete the 6000 years
the 6 days of 1000 years each, before the seventh day of 1000 years be­
gins, the Millenium. It seems to be the plan of God to begin the Sab­
bath rest about 40 years earlier to give Satan a season to deceive the na­
tion before the great judgment week begins, at the end of the Millenium,
Rev. 20: 7-10.
We know that it is the pleasure of our Father in heaven to lengthen
times of blessing and shorten the periods of wrath and misery, and as
Daniel is to stand in his lot at the end of the 1335 years from the river
in 636 A. D. and the Sanctuary is cleansed, the Sabbath Millenium con­
ditions will be established in the near future to make ready for the res­
urrection and translation of the first fruits unto Christ.
One urgent duty of these days is to watch. If definite dates existed
when the change would take place, there would be no cause to be watch­
ful the people would know.
T H E I M A G E G O V E R N M E N T
The image is the symbol of Gentile government among the nations for
Seven Times, 2520 years, and about 40 years of tumult to the govern­
ment of Christ and the Saints.
The period of Feet Government is now making history. Government
by Jesus is next.
The Old Man’s Feet Are Bad; they are tired, stiff *nd sore and travel
is irksome and painful. He will soon be retired by the Lord.
Prophecy likens government to iron mixed with mirey clay- for this
time, which will not cling together. The people want to dictate the gov­
ernment and they are confused, divided, quarreling, selfish and drunken
on sins.
Government under the Image is now closing its rule over ALL PEO­
PLES, NATIONS AND LANGUAGES (Dan. 4:1) and the Stone Gov-
T he I mage Government 105
eminent is coming into power. Dan. 2, analyzes the character of the
Image Rule, and history has revealed its duration. The feet represent the
3rd Babylon.
The Third Babylon is soon to fall. The frantic efforts to avoid wur
hope to prevent it.
The First Babylon was the Babel of Nimrod, Gen. 11:9. It fell in the
confusion of languages.
The First Image empire was the Second Babylon' and Nebuchadnezzar
was the chief actor, chosen as a servant of God, and given rulership to
continue in several forms for seven times 2520 years, which was pieced
out as follows:
90 years of the Nebuchadnezzar Babylon— Gold, from 3376
A. M., 622-23 B. C.
201 years of the Persian empire— Silver.
303 years of the Grecian empire, — Brass, the belly, four di­
visions- four kingdoms.
666 years of the Roman Empire— Brass, the thighs, making half
of the Seven Times or
1260 years on the opposite side of the Chronological river to the
Moslem rule.
Dan. 12:6— The Man on the waters of the river called off Time. Times
and a Half as the age or duration of the kingdoms on the opposite side of
the river, heard by the man on that bank; half of Seven Times.
The man on this side heard Time, Times and a Half, and when he
shall have managed to scatter (break small) the power of the holy peo­
ple all these (things of Daniel’s prophecy) shall be finished— legs, rule
of iron.
Daniel did not understand about the time of breaking small and hailed
the Lord to know about the end. He answered that the words were closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Now is the time of the end, and
the words are opened and unsealed to the wise who .are to understand.
Let him who will take heed now. The Wise are to understand.
The 1260 years on this side of the river began about September 638
A. D., and ended in 1898-9 A. D. The period of breaking small is seen
in the further revelation of the man on the river waters as an added
period now passing.
From the time the abomination that maketh desolate is set up, there
shall be 1290 days— years. The desolating abomination was the Moham­
medan rule set over Jerusalem in the summer of 638 A. D., and 1290
106 T hy K ingdom C om e
years ended in 1929. Here the Old Man’s Feet went bad and 40 years
from 1898 ends the Image Age.
The third era the River Voice announced was 1335 days— years, to
the blessed time when Daniel would stand in his lot. That can mean no
less than his resurrection and promotion in the Kingdom of Jesus. 638 and
1335 are 1973.
This era is 5 and 40 years longer than 1290 years. Five years added to
1923-9 is 1933-34. The 40 years on 1899 reach1939 before which or soon
after the great crisis in governments will come. Then follows 40 years
of restoration to 1973-4, the glorious Kingdom of Peace.
An illustration of the fall is given in Rev. 17:11-14. The eighth beast
is of the beast of seven heads, which was the Constantine the Great
Christian Empire, one leg of the Image, that held power along side of
the Mohammedan Empire the other leg for 1260 years to 1898, when
the Kaiser of Germany, as an ally of Turkey, entered Jerusalem, expeet-
ig to become the world ruler in his palace built on Mount Olives.
The World War as a fulfillment of prophecy is now history. It con­
firmed Daniel’s forecasts.
The ten horns of the eighth beast will make war with the Lamb who
is Jesus under the character of a conqueror and He will overcome them,
give peace to all and end trouble.
The ten kings or horns of the Third Babylon will soon be made known.
The watching willbe enabled to know them.
The great and devastating wars of the time of the end have commenced
or may begin at any time, and they will end in the Holy Land, the Ar­
mageddon battle, when the slaughter by the Lord will be many times
greater than the calamity poured upon the 185,000 soldiers of Sennach­
erib, king of Assyria, made dead corpses in one night. The Lord has
poison gas or makes vacuums as he wills over the wicked or sends other
destructive forces.
A noise is soon to come to the ends of the earth ip a controversy the
Lord will have with the nations; he will plead with all flesh and give
them wlm are wicked to the sword. And the slain of the Lord shall be
Lorn one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth, they
shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried; they shall be dung
upon the ground.
Another view of the wrath to come upon the ungodly anv time soon
as in these words— He cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls
that: fly in the midst of heaven- Come and gather yourselves together to
the supper of the great God; that you may eat of the flesh of Kings.
T he I mage Government 107
and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh
of horses, and of them who sit on them, and the flesh of all, tree and
bond, both small and great.
Another presentation is described in this way— With righteousness
shall He judge the poor and reprove with equity the meek of tire earth;
and He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the
breath of His lips shall He slay the wicked.
Again warning has been given as follows— And a mighty angel took
up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying; Thus
with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall
l>
<
>found no more at all.
The message of Jesus— Take heed to yourselves that your heart; be.
at no time' stupefied by gluttony and inebriety and worldly care- so that
day comes upon yon unawares. For, like a hunter’s snare, it will spring
upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole land. Watch ye, there­
fore ,at all times, and pray that ye may be accounted worthy to escape
all these things that shall come to pass and to attend before the Son of
Man,—
Let the poor leave the big cities.
Again—
And unto the angel of the church of Laodicea (a type of
church now) write: I know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot;
I would thou were cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm and1
neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.—Rev. 14-15. •
.
The old man’s feet are bad.
You looked at it (the image) till you saw a Stone cut out of the moun­
tain without hands which struck the image upon his feet- part iron and
part mirey clay- and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay,
the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to bits and became like the
chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away and
no place was found for them; and the Stone that smote the image be­
came a great mountain (kingdom) and filled the whole earth. Dan. 2nd
chapter.
This smiting is the perplexity of the nations now on and the end of
their rule is near, and deadly communistic riotings will prevail among
the wicked in all nations. Then the kingdom of Jesus will follow and give
peace to the world.
Another voice from heaven gives advice—
Come out of her (the Image
feet Babylon) my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and re­
ceive not of her plagues— death, mourning and famine. Rev. 18:4-8. Pray
for guidance.
Come out of the bad religions of men; out of bad politics that ignore
108 T hy Kingdom C om e
injustice, extortion, intemperance, and baneful habits; out of mad mer­
chandising and greed in doing business; out of worthless gaming and
sporting for fame and profits; out of fiction reading, bewitching amuse­
ments and follies and the evils of society and eating and drinking with
the drunken.
The scripture of Isa. 26:20-21 is timely advice— “come my people,
enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee; hide thy­
self. as it were for a little moment- until the indignation be overpast. For,
behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the
earth (for flieir iniquity.” Hoarded wealth will be of no use in this emer­
gency. The Christian farm home is a safe retreat.
Racketeering and gangster rule will increase until the wicked bring
their iniquity to the full, and then sudden destruction will overtake them.
The people of the Lord have evidence to see that they are to come out
of Babylon. The Lord will not avoid punishing those who are among and
with people doing evil and loving sin, because the testimony of their as­
sociation indicates they are partners in the sins.
The matter is one that should be acted upon with calmness and prayer
and dependence upon the Lord for his guidance. Let there be no out­
burst of excitement over it. Every person acts wisely to arrange tor a
quiet farm abode to which he or she can go when there is danger. They
may not be needed by some, but no one knows. It is prudence to be
ready to avoid the worst. The Bible God still rules.
Many will be obliged to make sacrifice to come away from the sins of
the people, the shameful habits, excesses, sporting, vain and silly amuse­
ments, feasting and banqueting, merchandising or speculation in business
and from the practice of dishonesty, cheating and fraud for profit. The
Lord is still honest.
The wage earner will do wisely to search for employment where his
labor will be connected with the handling or production of what is need­
ed for healthful, upright and godly living. The wise farmer will grow
what is useful in virtuous temperate living.
Jesus is the coming King. Study his life, obey his teaching and you will
be kept safe in the coming storm that will destroy many.
Rev. 18:11-15 and James 1:15 point out the abuses made of good and
useful things for speculation and profit and results.
This message is understanding for the wise. The wise are to under­
stand. But none of the wicked shall understand; they will continue to
do wickedly.

The material in this book was published in serial form in our magazine,
The Beacon Light, resulting in our receiving a great many letters asking
questions regarding preparation for the great upheavals portrayed. As
we were unable to answer this volume of mail individually, we answered
pertinent questions through the medium of our magazine; in fact, we
have been talking preparation for many years, but especially through
1939 and 1940 we have published articles on preparation.
In September we reprinted much of the material along this line that
was out of print, under the heading of “Preparation”; and copies of this
number may be obtained at 25c. This does not, however, include all the
material in the earlier issues of 1940, starting with the January number.
At present we are able to supply complete sets of the 1940 issues to date;
these may be obtained at the rate of 6 for $1.00. As some issues are
getting low we reserve the right to substitute.
In these articles on Preparation you will find practical advice on what
to do, where to go, and what the essentials of preparation are, material
and spiritual. We expect other questions, and these will also be answered
in The Beacon Light. If a personal answer is desired please enclose
$1.00; although in most cases you will find your answer in the printed
material, and we prefer that you exhaust this source before asking for
a personal letter.
Astrology is the most accurate of all time markers; and it indicates
that the time is very short. We shall have much to say on this subject,
in our Predictions for 1941, ready December 15th.

Read THE BEACON LIGHT
THE MOST VITAL MAGAZINE IN AMERICA TODAY
A MAGAZINE dedicated to the publicizing of TRUTH; in
other words, we are endeavoring to present a Wheel of Truth,
with special emphasis on Prophecy, from all sources.
WE CORRELATE the truths of the Bible, Astrology and the
Great Pyramid of Gizeh. We teach that our present chaos is
caused by a violation of the Laws of God— and that the Laws
of God are taught in the Bible and in the Heavens.
WE TEACH that the Christian Bible contains a perfect plan
for our everyday life, pertaining to healthy physical bodies and
healthy economic conditions.
WE HAVE WARS, and rumors of wars, sickness, pestilence
and famine, because we have departed from the blue print God
gave to man, via the Christian Bible.
WE BELIEVE in a concrete expression of Astrology, instead
of merely an abstract study. Only as we apply Astrology to our
everyday life, is it of any practical value to us. >
WE BELIEVE that Astrology has more to offer the masses
than any other philosophy or science in the world today; that it
augments and strengthens the teachings of the Christian Bible
and those of the Great Pyramid, these three great sources of
truth forming a trinity.
WE ARE WILLING to accept truth from any source whatso­
ever, but we refuse to accept a teacher, or philosopher, unless
some evidence is given to support their claims. As the Good
Book says, “Prove all things; hold fast to that which is good.”
THE BEACON LIGHT is now in its eighth year; and our
readers say it is the most vital of all the magazines they read.
It will help you to attain peace of mind, or in other words,
physical, mental and spiritual health; and that is what we are
all striving for.
WHY NOT send a dollar for a 6 months’ trial subscription, and
prove for yourself the truth of this statement?
Subscription price $2.00 per Year, 6 months for $1.00, Single

It is generally conceded that we Americans should revere our
national flag, the Stars and Stripes, and should display it on all
patriotic occasions, such as the Fourth of July, Decoration Day
and so on.
And of course we expect to find at least one Bible in every
home; for our Constitution and the fundamental laws of our
country have their roots in the Israel laws in the Old Testament.
In addition to those two reminders, I believe every home
should contain at least one picture of the Christ, as a daily re­
minder, especially as we sit at our table, or retire for the night;
for the one hope for America, and the whole world, is the Sec­
ond Coming of Christ.
And so, to this end, we are presenting for your consideration,
what we feel to be the most outstanding picture of the Christ,
of which the picture on the cover is a small reproduction. We
give below the interesting history of the original of this picture:
Miss Bertha Valerius, a Swede, in 1856 began this picture under
guidance from the Beyond.
After many attempts, she being quite untrained in art, the picture
(10 by 6 feet) was finished to her satisfaction in 1896.
Soon after, in accordance with the promise of the Angelic Messen­
gers, she passed away peacefully in her sleep.
The message of the picture was stated to be the need for a belief in
a living Christ, still active for the world’s upliftment.
The original occupies the place of honor in a private chapel in
Stockholm. By request of the Xnspirors, there appears beneath the pic­
ture the verse. St. John 17:9:
“I pray for them whom Thou hast given Me_ for they are Thine.”
We offer hand colored photographic enlargements at the fol­
lowing prices, postpaid:

Revelation Year 1941
Head of Gold; Chest of Silver;
Belly of Brass; Legs of Iron;
Feet of Clay.
Dear Student of Tomorrow:
Just imagine being suddenly awakened in the middle of the night and
seeing before you an image as tall as a tree, with a head of glistening
gold, chest of shining silver, belly of brass, legs of iron, feet of clay.
It was King Nebuchadnezzar who actually experienced this. You remem­
ber, he lost much sleep over it.
The golden head of the great image represented Nebuchadnezzar's king­
dom. The chest, the belly, and then the legs represented kingdoms far­
ther and farther down the stream of time. The TEN TOES of the image,
composed of iron and clay, represented the kingdoms or groups of nations
that were to exist in "the time of the end" — TODAY.
In this unusual dream the King also saw a HUGE STONE strike the feet
of the image; grinding them to dust. Today, nearly 2520 years later, a
most unusual book has just been published. It is, "THY KINGDOM
COME."
This book reveals the astonishing fact that a HUGE STONE— practically
as big as a planetoid— is racing through cosmic space toward the earth.
It will strike the earth a terrific blow. Those nations represented by the
TEN TOES of the great image will be GROUND INTO DUST.
In the revelations found in 'T H Y KINGDOM COME" you will find the
approximate time and place where the GREAT STONE will strike the
earth, and a most vivid description of what takes place afterwards.
Herewith, we include highlights regarding this invaluable and prophetic
book. Your copy is ready to go forward to you at once. We are,
Yours very sincerely,
WILLIAM KUUGREN
"When the Fighting A il Over the World is at its Height, There W ill Come
a GREAT ROCK Out of the Dark Reaches of the Sky, and It Will

THE above is quoted from "THY KINGDOM

concerning the immediate future you have ever

it went still further and gave the approximate

When it comes near enough, so that it^eefn be
seen by the unaided eye, a great feerf; such as
the world has never known before-, will paralyze
the masses.
Every eye will see the GREAT ROCK rushing
toward the earth as it re­
volves on its axis. With each
revolution of the globe, the
GREAT ROCK will come
nearer — apparently becoming
larger and larger — until the
earth, at night, reflects its fiery
red. .

strikes, the earth will be driven
nearer to the sun. This impact
will also cause the globe to be­

they will seem to have been re­

fragments will create great havoc in
the western hemisphere. An area of
Canada and the United States will be
the only haven of safety in the whole
world.
However, before this stunning blow
of the GREAT ROCK, Mexico and
South America will become disorgan­
ized by earthquakes, tornadoes, cyc­
lones, electrical storms and by intense heat. In the east­
ern hemisphere, Germany, Austria and Western Russia
will almost become annihilated by the impact of the
GR EAT ROCK. The fate of France, Italy, and the
B A LK A N STATES will be only a little less severe.
The loss of life in India will be tremendous. Africa
will be spared to some extent .in the southern portions.
"Thy Kingdom Come" Extremely Practical
“T H Y K IN G D O M COM E” not only tells what wiH
take place throughout the world, especially in America
during the next few years (next few months,) but it
tells every individual what to do between now and the
time the G R EA T ROCK strikes the earth.
“ T H Y K IN G D O M CO M E” is filled from cover to
cover with information, instruction and revelation. It is
by no means “ morbid.” In reality, it is a most joyous
book. The events.that take place among mankind after
the G R EA T R O CK has brought peace to earth, are the
most thrilling parts of “ T H Y K IN G D O M COME.”
