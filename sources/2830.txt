nough'a ; he woultl not pay for them ; she had coat him too mnch already; that
his things were kept at the hotel on that account. Helng afraid that thla might
more deeply involve my daughter, I ofl'ered my O"Yn ahawl to replace the one taken;
Mr. Hoyte firat took It but afterward returned It to me on my promise that I would
pay for the shawl and bonnet. In the couree ,of the day, Mri. Tarbert found
my daughter, butahe would iiotramito'my hoiiiC;!atae aent the bonnet and ahawl,
which were returned to their owner, who had lent them to my daughter, to uai•t
her in procuring her escape from Mr. Hoytc at the hotel. Early on the afternoon
of the aame day, Mr. Hoyte came to my hou&e with the ume old man, wishing me
to make al! lily effort• to fin~ ;the ·sir!, in tho meantim~ sjiealdng very bitterly
against the Catholies, the Priests, arid the Nuns; mentioning' that 'fll)' daughter
had been in the nunnery, wh,.re she ha~ ~en.ill treated. I denied that my daughter
had ever been in a nunnery ; that when she was about eight years of age ahe went
to a day.school.• At the tinie came in two other per110na, whom Mr. Hoyte intro·
duced, one was' Rev. Mr. IJre\tster, I do not recollect the other reverence's name.
They all requeated me, in 'the molt ·pressing terms, to try 'to make It out ; my
daughter had been ;.,·the- nu'rlnery ;'arid that she·had some connection with the
Priests 'Jf the seminary, 'of which hunneries and Prieata she spilke In the moat ont·
rageous terms i said, that should I niilke that out, myself, "
my daughter, and child,
would be protecte<t for life. · I expected to get rid oftheir importaniriel, in relating
the melancholy circumstances by which my daughter was frequently lleranged in·
her head, and told t~m, that 'when at the age of about seven years, she broke a
alate pencil in her head ; that since that time her mental faculties were derana:ed,
:ind by'times much more than at other ttmes, but that she IYas far' from·being an
idiot; that she could make the most ridiculous, ·but most·plaus.ible atories; and
that as tq the history that she had been in a nunnery, it'waa a fabrication, for she
never was in a nunnery ; that at olte time I wished to obtain a J>lace in a nunnery
'fc:ir her·; ·thatl had··em?loyed ·the Influence ··ot Madame'de Montenach, •of Dr.
Nelson,andOfour·pastor,'the Rev. ;Mr~'uson, but witho\Jtsuccesa; ,. I·told them

•
J\Iontreal·in veneration, u the moat pious and charitable· persOn& ·1 ever knew.
After many more solicit:.tions to' the ume efl'ect, three of them retired,. but Mr.
Hoyte remained;'adding to the' other solicitations·; he was atopped, a person bav·
·ing rapped '~t the door: ·it"wu tlien candlelight. •, I opened, the idoor; and: found
·DOctor McDOi\ald,' who told .me·that my daughter Marla waa at his home, i n

Hoyle told her;· my dear Mary, Lam eorry.you have treated ;your.elf and'me in

him. Next morning Mr. Hoyle retnrnell, and was more prenln1 than in his for•
mer aol!cltatlc~, and requated me to aay that my dau1hter had been In the nun·
nery : that ahould I aay ao, It would be better than one hundred pounds to me ;
that I would be protected for lile,and thatlahould leave Montreal,and that I would
be better provided for el.ewhere I anawered, that th:>uaands of pounda would
not induce me to perjure myaelf; then he go« llllUcy ynd abu11ve to the aLmoat ;
he aald he came to Montreal to detect the hofamy:Of the Prieata and the Suna;
that he could not lean my dau1hter destitute In the'wlde world as I had done;
afterward aald, No I ahe Ia not you~ <laughter,. l~ too 1ensible f>Jr that, and

went ~way-He was gone but a few minutes, when \b.•.Jolice~.an ~ent Magla·

just now called upon bim, and requested him to let 1Af' kpbw that I had a daiJal)ter
in Montreal; that she had come 111 with a Mr. Hoyle';{114 a child, and that abe~-·

me to look for her, and that I might prevent some mltehief 'thp.~ .was going on.
Then I related to him partly what I have above aaid. When.he t(~ _
going, two
other gentlemen came I refused tn give' them any information at firtt,·expecting
tho\t they were ofthe party that had so much agitat"d me for a fe-iv days ibut being
lmformed by Mr Doueet,thatheknf'w one ofthem, particularly Mr. Perkins, for
a respectable citizen lor a long time in \lontreal, and the other Mr. Curry, two
niinisters from the Umted States, that if they came to obtain some information
about the distreMing <:venia she related to have occurred in her family, he thought
it would do no harm, and I related to them ; they appeared to be afflicted with
such a circumstance; I have not aeen them any more. I asked Mr. Doucet if the
man Hoyle could not be put in jail ; he replied that he thought not, for what he
knew of the business. Then I asked if the Priests were informed of what was
going on ; he replied, yes, but they never take up these things ; they allow their
chatacter to defend itself. A fews <Jay after, I heard that my daughter was at one
Mr. Johnson's, a joiner, at Griffintowot, with Hr. Hoyle; that he passed her for
a nun that had escaprd from the Hotel Dieu Nunnery. I went there two days
successively with Mrs. Tarbert; the .first day, Mrs. Johnson denied her,
and said that she was gone to New York with Mr. lloyte. As I was returning, I
met Mr. Hoyle on the wharf and I reproached him for his conduct. I told him
that my daughter had been denied me at Johnson's, but that I would have a search-
wairant to have her; when I returned, he had really gone with my unfortunate
·daughter; and l:receivetJ from Mr Johnson, his w,ife and a number of persons
·hi their house the grossea abuse, mixed with texts of the Gospel·, r.lr. Johnsnn
bringing a 'Biblei~r me to swear on. , I retired 'n."Jre deeply aftlicted than ever,
