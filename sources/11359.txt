The baby was born at 1:19am on October 15th. My doctor pushed down on my abdomen to help expel the afterbirth. I remember blood shot all over the nurse and her uniform. I heard her tell the doctor that she didn't have a clean uniform and would have to go home to get one. The doctor was yelling 'Go get the oxygen'. All of this time I was thinking 'Just leave me alone'. 

There was the most brilliant light I had ever seen. I felt so warm and loved. There was a golden ladder going into the heavens and you couldn't see the top of it as it disappeared into fluffy clouds up so high.  Around the bottom of the ladder there were several Angels flitting about. I felt at peace and happy, and wanted to stay there.

I was then taken to a room so I could get some rest.  When I woke up, a nurse was sitting by my bed. She tried to take my blood pressure but couldn't get a reading on my left arm, so tried on my right arm.  Nothing. She went and got a different pressure cuff, and just could not get a good reading on me. The doctor came and they gave me several shots. I did not have one drop of blood on my pad. The doctor asked the nurse if anyone had changed my pad, she said 'no'.  The last I heard, he was living in Oregon somewhere.
