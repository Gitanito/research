I was in the recovery room in an oxygen tent and had a lot of trouble waking up because the operation lasted over seven hours and I was thirteen.

I was in much pain, it hurt everywhere, and I had tubes in the mouth, in the head and the hip. Suddenly, my body was lifted and I saw myself in bed with all those tubes. I was floating above it. I was in a state of complete bliss, everything was beautiful, and, especially, I was not suffering any more, the pain was gone and I felt really good. Then, I saw a tunnel with a white dot at the end that attracted me. I moved toward it, and as I was moving on, the white dot was getting bigger and bigger, and I kept going.

Then, I heard the nurse telling me that my parents, my aunts and several family members had phoned to ask for me and at this very moment, I stumbled into bed and all the pain was back again!

Now I think that if the nurse had not reported on the calls, I might not be here anymore.

I had other surgeries after this one, but this experience only happened in this one, the first one.
