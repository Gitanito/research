I rose above it to the point where my thorax was just above my head. I do not know where my legs and feet were. I was able to look down through my head and into the inside of my body. I saw nothing there but blood dripping from the inside of my empty rib cage. I could see the inside of the soles of my feet. There was a bright light above and behind me. I went back into my body and the light went away.
