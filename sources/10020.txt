  		              		Experience Description   

    I was floating in an innertube at the beach. A wave came up and knocked me off the innertube and I fell under the water. I couldn't swim and I started to think I was going to drown. 

  Everything became very peaceful and non-threatening. I remember a life review and seeing events in my short life as they went  through my brain. I saw events in my life such as trips to my grandmother's house. I was in the dark and saw a light at the end of what seemed like a tunnel. I felt like I was being pulled to the light and I knew once I got there I would have crossed over. I was never scared or afraid, but was reassured that everything would be all right. As I got close to the light, a grid came down in front of me and stopped me from going any further. 

  I remember waking up and coughing up water. My mother was yelling down the beach looking for me. I had drifted a ways down the shore. No one saved me or helped me, but it was like I was just washed up on the shore. Later on, I realized that the grid I had seen looked like a circuit board. I started dreaming a lot more after that and having almost prophetic dreams.

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain     I was only 8 at the time, so it's hard for me to say how I was before. I just know that I was very sensitive to others after the event and started having intensely vivid dreams.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Several years. It wasn't until I was older and understood what it was that I began to tell people about it. I took a class at the community college when I was 17 on Thanatology and Raymond Moody came to speak to the class.
