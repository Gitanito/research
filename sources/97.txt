of Free and Accepted M ASO NS.
G entlem en and B r e t h r e n ,
T
H E Antiquity of your excellent Fraternity, the
univerfality of its plan, and the moral re&itude
and purity of its defign, claim a decided pre-eminence
over every other Bond of Society into which menkind
have ever formed themfelves, for the mutual welfare and
happinefs of each other. The noblenefs of foul which
firft prompted to its inftitution, and the benevolence of
heart which has ever iince prevailed throughout all its
members, will remain a fubjeft of lafting admiration!
To you, therefore, as the promoters of liberal fenti-
merrt, and the guardians of every ufeful fcience, I com­
mit this venerable pile of ancient Aftrology ; a fabric
obviouily conilru&ed by the Great Architect of the
World, primeval with the ordination of nature, andin-
feparable from one of the grand fubjedts of your official
contemplation.
This Science, by being little known, and lefs under-
itood, may meet with cenfurc and difapprobation from
. that
D E D I C A T I O N .
that defcription of learned, as well as of illiterate men,
whofe rule of faith uniformly keeps pace with their own
arbitrary conceptions. But the difpaflionate part ofman­
kind, with every good Mafon, will candidly weigh the
evidence “ by the balance of the SanCtuary,” and referve
their fentence till after a fair and impartial trial.
Sheltered, therefore, under the wing of your fraternal
regard, and patronized by every fober admirer of the
fecret works of Nature, I ihall attempt to lay the Foun­
dation Stone of an illuitrious Building, facred to Urania,
upon which fome more able and ingenious Workman,
fanctioncd by your patronage and protection, may here­
after raife the edifice to out-top the Ikies, and, like Ja­
cob’s ladder, pierce the itarry region, leading the intel­
lectual faculties of the foul to the moil fublime contem­
plations of God and Nature.
I have the honour to profefs myfelf, with unequivocal
attachment and eileem, G en tlem en ,
Your Accepted Brother,
And faithful Servant,

My F r ien d ,
W
H O E V E R thou art, that {halt with fo much
eafe receive the benefit of my laborious ftudies,
and doft intend to proceed in acquiring this heavenly
knowledge of the Stars, wherein the great and admirable
works of the inviiible and all-glorious God are fo mani-
feftly apparent, in the firft place confider and adore thy
omnipotent C R E A T O R , and be thankful unto him for
thy exiftence. Be humble, andletnonaturalknowledge,
how profound and tranfcendent foever it be, elate thy
mind, or withdraw thee from thy duty to that divine "
Providence, by whofe all-feeing order and appointment
all things heavenly and earthly have their conftant and
never-ceafing motion; but the more thy knowledge is
enlarged by this comprehendve fcience, the moredothou
magnifythepowerandwifdomof the Almighty God, and
ftrive to preferve thyfelf in his favour; havingin conftant
remembrance, that the more holy thou art, and the
nearer thou approacheft to God in thy religious duties,
the purer judgment (halt thou always give. Beware of
pride and felf-conceit, yet never forget thy dignity. Re-
( V i)
t
fleCl often on the primeval ^ata of thy creation, that
thou waft formed in the perfect image of God, and that
no irrational creature durft offend Man., the Microcofm,
hut did faithfully ferve and obey him, io long as he was
mailer of his reafon and pafliotis, or until he fuflered his
own Free-Will to be governed by the unreafonable part.
But alas! when the firft father of us all gave up the reins
to his difobedient affections, and deferted his reafon
and his God, then every creature and beaft of the field
became rebellious anddifobedienttohiscommand. Stand
fail theft, O Man! to thy integrity, and thy religion!
confider thy own noblenefs, and that all created things,
bothprefent andtocome, wereforthyfakecreated; nay,
for thy fake, even God became man; Thou art that crea­
ture, who, being converfant with Chriil, liveft and con-
verfeft above the heavens. How many privileges and ad­
vantages hath God bellowed onthee! thourangeftabove
the heavens by contemplation, and conceiveft the motion
and magnitude of the Stars; thou talkeft with angels;
yea, with God himfelf: thou haft all creatureswithin thy
dominion,andkeepeft the Devils in fubjeCtion. Thy ca­
pacity for acquiring knowledge is unlimited by thy Ma-
( T O )
ker; and the bleifedneisof an enlightenedmind willbring
theetheconfolationsof joy and happinefs— Do not then,
for ihame, deface thy nature, nor make thyfelf unworthy
of theie celeftialgifts; donot deprive thyfelf of thepower
and glory God hath allotted thee, for the poffellion of a
few imperfect, vain, and illufory, pleafures.
W h e n thou hail perfected the contemplation of thy
God, and coniidered the extent of thofe faculties with
which thou art endued, thou wilt be fit to receive the
following inftru&ion, and to know in thy pradtice how
to condudl thyfelf.— As thou wilt daily converfe with the
heavens, foinftrudl and form thy mind according to the
image ofdivinity. Learn all the ornaments of virtue; and
be fufficiently inftrudled therein. Be humane,courteous,
familiar to all, and eafy of accefs. Afflidl not the unfor­
tunate with the terrors of a fevere fate; in fuch cafes, in­
formthemoftheirhardfortune with fympatheticconcern;
direct them to call upon God to divert the judgments im-
pendingover them; to fummon up all their fortitude, and
to endeavour to remove the threatened evil, by a manly
exercife ofthat free-will with which the all-merciful God
hath endowed them. B e modeftinconverfation, andaflo-

lofles impending over him j while men of a profligate and carelefs
habit not only lofe the advantages of a promifing nativity, but, if
born under malevolent afpe£Uk are often reduced to the laft ftage of di-
ffrefs, and periih under the very fame ftrokes of nature, which wifer
and better men, born in the fame inaufpicious moments, have endured
with much eafc. And thus farfapiens dominabitur ajiries, the wife man,
above the fool, may rule his ftars. But we muft not forget, that under
thefe operations of fatf. there are many influences fo powerful, that no
wifdom of man can oppofe. Such are A e fatal wounds of death, when
nature’s glafs is run out, and fuch the violent blows of excruciating
pain and ficknefs, and the high tides of profperity and adverfity; in all
which cafes, we find by experience, aftra regunt homines, the ftars rule
and overpower men. Yet neverthelefs, fuch is the infinite prefcience
and providence of God, that forefeeing the defires and deferts of all wife
and holy men, in their different ages and times, he alfo laid their fates
foiling to their aftions. He forcfaw Jofeph’s prayers and tears in his
captivity, and accordingly provided his advance in nature to correfpond
therewith*. He forefaw Hannah’s faffing, and eameft prayer, and ordained
her opening womb to bud forth in courfe of nature exaftly anfwering
thereto-f*. So that the wifdom and w ill of man has its full free work,
without reftraint or controul; and grace and virtue adf by their own
principles, as they are led by the Holy Ghoff j and yet nature, as it was
contrived from all eternity, a£ls freely too. This is the do&rine we are
taught by the word of God, which is confirmed by the evidence of our
own reafon and experience.
Now the fcience which we call Affrolo3y, is nothing more than the
ftudy or invefligation of this frame ormodel of nature, with all its admi­
rable productions and effe&s j whereby we acquire a knowledge of the fe-
cret virtues of the heavens, and the ihining luminaries therein contained.
It is a fcience which all may attain to, by common diligence and applica­
tion ; and, the more we delight in it, the more readily do we forefee the
motions of future events, and the curiofities of chance and natural acci­
dents, and the courfesof luck by which both are governed, and the order
o f fate, unto which all o f them are fubiervient; together' with all the
moil curious a£is of attracting and expelling, alluring and threatening,
encouraging and difheartening, and all fuch-like operations of nature,
moft fecretly and imperceptibly performed, beyond the reach of ima­
gination« And, as by aikill in this ffudy we attain to fee and experience
things that are paff, fo by the fame ¿kill we attain to a knowledge o f

That the fan, m
oon, an
d all theplanets, haveadireftan
dobvious influ­
ence uponearthly fubftances, n
o m
an of com
m
on obfervation will pretend
to deny. The fun is the fountainof heat, an
d that heat is the nurfe of
life; an
d the m
oon is the fountain of m
oifture, which tem
pers the vio­
lent heat of the fun, and m
odifies all his operations. But the fun and
m
oon, an
d all the planets, have each of them aparticular fpecific pro­
perty, accordingto their ow
n innate quality, an
d according to the nature
of that fign or band of ftars, under which they happen to be pofited.
This is a fa£
t eftablifhed by repeated obfervation an
d experience>for
w
hen the fun en
ters theequinodtial fign Aries, the fpring begins toihew
herfelf, an
dall vegetative nature, by the m
oon’s hum
idity, an
d the fun’s
tem
perate heat, feem
s to revive an
d flourifh, and, a
s it w
ere, to rife from
the dead; whitherthecold blafts of thehycm
nal air, had beforeconfigned
it. So w
hen his radian
t beam
s enter the fign Taurus, they ftir upthe
benignInfluences of the Pleiades an
d H

north, an
d Orion to thefouth, an
d Arfturus finking belowthehorizon ;
an
d their cold an

ts begin to ceafe, a
s they are fuc-
ceeded by thefe benevolent conftellations, whichproduce w
armibuthern
winds, an
dgentleihowers, repleniihing theearth, an
dcaufingvegetation.
Again, w
hen the fun rifes with the Dog-ftar, w
e fin
d aninfluence which
caufes vehem
cncy of heat, contagion, an
d infirm
ity. M
edicam
ents ad-
m
iniitered under this conftellation, prove hardan
d obnoxious; and we
finddogs at this tim
e a
re apt to ru
n m
ad; the feais troubledwithoutany
apparent caufe, and all n
ature feem
s m
ore or lefs opprefled by it; an
d
yet thefe effeds a
re never found tobeequally violent inanytwofum
m
ers,
which clearly proves an influence inthe ftars, a
s well a
s in the fun. And
again, though the fun keeps the fam
e conftant an
d invariable courfe
through the twelve figns of the Zodiack, for a
ninfinity of annual revo­
lutions, yet w
e never find the feafon
s an
d w
eather exaftly correfpond,
which they doubtlefs would do, w
as it not that cold an
dh
ear,, an
dwind
and rain, aregoverned by the configurations the fun has with the planets
and fixed ftars; andthis alfo evidentlyproves the force of their influence.
It is likewife m
anifeft^that w
henever the planet Saturn is palling out of
one fign intoanother, the W
eath
er is m
oreor lefs turbulentandunfettled*-
But it is not the w
eather only, nor the inanim
ate part of thecreation
*
alone, that is affeded by the influences of the fun, m
oon, an
d planets;
for we find they operate upon the hum
an fpecies, an
d upon all anim
ate
nature, in every part of the world. The fun, an
d the quality of the
heavens about the torrid zone, naturally occafion thofe m
en who a
reb

an

It is obfervable, that the inhabitants of the fouth, a
re of abetter and
quicker wit, an
d m

d tradtable; an
d this is ac­
counted for by their vertical point being fituated n
earer the zodiac, in

dthereforethey
abound with cold an
d m
oifture, an
d a
re of aphlegm
atic conftitution, of
a fair com
plexion, tall, courageous, an
d ingenuous. Europe being
fituated in the north-weft part of the earth, is under M

by reafo

turally of anoble an

d

fun, mo d i f i e d f i ^ g n s an

pafies, regulates the clim
ates, an
d fheds hisinfluenceupon all m
ankind,
leaving behind himevident m

indeed, have attem

of the favage race, by avariety of other plaufible conjedtures; but n
on
e
arc to be relied on, that do not attribute its caufe to the intenfe heat an

atural to believe that all the others

oil
phyficians knowthat theplanet Satu

that every feventh year Saturn com

dthat after therevolution
of the fun, he becom

d is often
obferved, by his configurations with them

e thefatal crifis
of thofe defperate disord
ers, over which the patient w
as not expefted to
live. From thefe phyfical reafon
s, w
e m
ay fafely conclude that Saturn
is by n

s the fun is hot an
dchearful; an
d
being thus oppolite to the funjn quality ande

ence it follows, that

But befidcs thefe ligniorities of the fun, m

turns into fleih and blood, receives life, and is fo admirably formed into
a perfedt child, that learns to cry, and fpeak, and call ? You will lay»
perhaps, That this is the immediate workmanlhip and efledt of God.
But tnis we already know ; the only qucftion is, how he does i t ; whe­
ther by means, or without ? If without means, then every child that is
born, and every feed that grows out of the ground, mull of neceffity come
to pafs by a new creation ; for to bring things into exiftence without
means, is the fame as to produce them without matter j and requires no
more ; but for the Almighty to fay, Let there be men, or, Let there be
leaves and flowers j and, as the Word fays, they come to pafs. But we
are certain there never was more than one creation, which was at the be­
ginning of the world, and ever fince that time, all things have come to
pafs by a regular courfe of nature; and hence it follows that there muft
be a natural and efficient means, for the production of all things. And.
if fo, then muft thefe things come to pafs by an earthly means alone, or
elfe by the aid and affiftance of fome celeftial influence. But by an earthly
means alone, it is evident, they cannot come to pafs; for we know ex­
perimentally, that neither fire,, earth,, air,, or water, can of themfelves in­
fufe into the rofe its grateful and fragrant fmell j it mult therefore pro­
ceed from the agency of fome fp iritu a l or material fubftance, far faperior
in efficacy and virtue to any earthly element. If it proceeds from a fpi-
ritual fubftance, it is effedied either by the angels, or by the fo u l o f the
world. But by the angels we know it cannot be, for they have their pe­
culiar offices allotted them in another w ay; and though they are fubjedts
of the world, yet are they no part of the great frame of nature, from
whence all things in their order are formed. And if it be effected by the
J iu l o f the world, then certainly muft there be l'uch a foul fomewhere ex-
ifting, which atprefent, is a matter in difpute among the learned j and this
foulmuft have a fpccial feat in the world, worthy of itfelf, from whence it
may inform and adluate every minute particle of the creation.. If this be
admitted, then it undoubtedly dwells among the celeftial matter, and from
thence fupplies the earth, through the medium o f the heavenly bodies,
with all that power and virtue, which brings to pafs that variety of ihape,
colour, fmell, life, and increafe, which we daily fee come to pafs. But
if this hypothefis be denied,, and it is infilled that the earth is fup-
plied with all her fecret virtues by fome fupernatural material fubftance;
then name any one thing befides the heavenly matter, and the ftars o f
heaven, that can be fuppofed to form that fubftance, and the argument
ceafes j for either way it proves an influence and afrology in the heavens,
beyond contradiction,, and there w ill remain only one queftion to be de­
cided, which is, Whether thefe celeftial influences create the fucceffion o f
earthly things, by an immediate power from God, or whether there exifts
F a
40 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
a general foul in the world, through the means of which they come to
pais in a due order and courfe of nature? Utrum horum mavis accipc; I
contend for no more. “ In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth •, and the earth was without form, and void, and darknefs was
upon the face of the deep, and the fpirit of God moved upon the face o f
the waters/' Here, when there was nothing but earth and water, and
darknefs overfpread all, the fp ir it o f God maintained that chaotic mafs,
and managed the earth by the water, and the water and darknefs by
himfclf. But now both the earth and water are under thefa ce o f heaven,
and the light is upon this heaven, and the fpirit of God moveth upon the
face of the heavens in that lig h t; and as he actuates the earth and the
waters by the heavens, fo doth he actuate the heavens by him felf And
agreeably to this idea fpeaks the prophet Hofea, when he fays, God w ill
hear the heavens, and they Jhall hear the earth, and the earth the corn and
wine and oil, and they * Jezreel wherein he ihews us, that as man lives
by coin and wine, fo they by the earth, and the earth by the heavens; and
if fo, then by the heavens is it that the earth receives all its efficacy and
virtue, whereby it brings forth fmell, colour, tafte, and life. Mofes
alfo tells us, that God Jhall open his good treeJure the heavens, to give rain
unto the land, arid to blefs all the -f* works o f our hands; whence it is evi­
dent that there lodges in the celeitial influences, a faculty of fortunating
civil affairs, as well as of managing natural things ; and that the root of
all earthly bleffings is from heaven. Mofes fays again, that the fu n , moon,
and flars, God hath dijlributed unto a ll nations under heaven; and the
Pfalmift fpeaking of the fun and heavenly bodies, fays, they declare the
glory o f God, and Jleewfo r th his handy-work ; day and night do continually
tell o f them, and their voice is heard in all languages, and their words are
gone into the ends o f the § world-, by which we learn that the heavens,
and all the liars therein, are full of fuch virtues as the whole world hath
need of; and that thefe virtues God hath lodged in the heavens, to be
dealt out for the comfort and happinefs of his creatures upon earth. H is
JP in t (faith Job) hath garnijl^ed the \ heavens-, and by the fp ir it o f bis
mouth was the whole army o f heaven made.
The notion, or idea, that there is one general foul aduating the whole
world, as there is one foul informing every man’s body, was not only the
opinion of the Platonifts and ancient philofophers, but alfo of many
learned men in later ages ; and I muff confefs, it appears very reafonable to
believe, that the world has fuch a foul. For were there not one and the
lame general living virtue, comprehending the whole fyftem of nature,

from the exterior circumference o f the heavens to the inmoil center of the
earth, how could the lympathies and antipathies of nature pofubly work
inch compliances and differences as we know they do, at the amazing
diitances we fee them, and without any vifible or imaginable contact;
unlefs fome faculty exifts in the world, that is capable of fuftaining this
invifible correfpondency between one creature and another ? Where life
is, thefe things are eafily effedted; as the child in the womb is nouriihed
by the food the mother eats; but in the inanimate part of the creation,
we are at a lofs which way to account for it. Now admitting that there
really is fuch an univerfal foul exiiting, yet is it queftionable whether
this foul be inteHeftual, or merely vegetive. That there is an intelledtual
power informing the whole world, as the foul does the body, is not to be
doubted; for otherwife the whole frame of nature would be inert and
motionleis; but then, if we admit the foul of the world to carry this in­
tellect in its own brain, it w ill follow, that this foul is a G od; lor an
intdledtual being, filling heaven and earth with its prefence, is an attri­
bute o f* Gods. Hence I conclude there is an univerfal foul in the.
world, but that it is only vegetive, and not intellectual; and that in this
foul dwells the fpirit of Almighty God, who fillcth the heavens and the
earth with his prefence, and from hence garniiheth the heavens, and
caufeth the precious influences of the fun, moon, and itars, to be diftri-
buted into all parts of the § world. And thus God rules immediately in
the heavens, but rules the world mediately by the heavens. It is true,
indeed, that God is equally well able to govern and maintain the world
without means, as he was at firil to conftitute and create the frame of na­
ture ; but fuch is His divine w ill and pleafure, that he has thought fit to
bring all things to pafs by virtue of means, as ordained from the beginning
o f the world. It is a common and true maxim, that God and nature
have made nothing in vain; and yet it is as true, that grafs and herbs
grow where no creatures live to eat -f*them. Now were the world go­
verned by God’s immediate prefence only, then would the produ&ion of
this grafs and herb be a work in vain; becaufe God’s word brings
forth all things at pleafure«,; and having a power of increafing or dimi-
niihing its operation in a moment, would certainly not have brought forth
this fertility in an uninhabited and defolate country. But nature running
her courfe by a conftant and unchangeable decree, has no power to ceal'e
her work without a miracle, and therefore though the grals may grow in
vain, yet nature’s operations are not in vain, fince by one and the fame
caufe, it produces vegetation in all parts of the world.

Known unto God are a ll his works¡from the beginning o f th e* w orld; and
therefore it would be derogatory to the attributes of the Deity, not to be­
lieve that the minuted: events of this world, were forefeen and provided
for in that moil perfect frame or model of nature, which as we have al­
ready feen, may be compared to the conftruttion of a watch, confiiling of
many fmall wheels, regulated by one mailer-wheel, or firil mover, which
being wound up at the creation, with the line of time, of a feemingly
infinite length, has ever fince been winding off, unto the prefent hour;
and yet is there ilill more line upon the w heel; but how much remains,
is only in the breail of the Almighty. And when this line ihall be en^
tirely wound off, then w ill the frame of nature find its -f*period, and all
fubordinate wheels will ceafe their motion. But until that time, there
is allotted in this frame of nature, unto every one that comes into the
world, a certain order or courfe of life, by which he runs through fick-
nefs and health, honour and diihonour, and all the occurrences of life,
from his cradle to the grave. For man is, as it were, a little world within
him felf; and though he itand but as one wheel in the frame of the great
world, yet within this one there feems many thoufands of wheels, efpe-
cially in enterpriiing people, which appear to move one within another
almoit ad infinitum, till the thread turned on the outer wheel break, or
elfe be wound oft, and there they make a flop, and die. All thefe things
God, who made man at the firil, perfedtly knows, and foreknew, from
the beginning of the world; and by this order of man’s life, he perfedlly-
knows all the paflages of our lives, and even the moil fecret thoughts of
our hearts, both fleeping and J waking; and how one thought drives off,
and brings on another, and continues fo doing till the lafl moment of our
life, when our breath fails. Now every man being, as it were, a wheel,
of the great world, it will follow that all men move in a certain frame or
wheel above themfelves, by virtue of which the mailer-wheel of every
man’s life is put in motion; and this wheel is fubordinate unto others,
and thefe alfo unto the mailer-wheel of the whole world, which is the
high and mighty wheel of heaven, wherein the fun, moon, and flars are*
fet, to carry on the great works of nature, unto the end of time. And
hence comes the original of every man’s nativity, and of all natural qua­
lities, paflions, and incidents of our lives, except the motions of our free­
will and reafon, which may be allured and inclined by the works of na­
ture, but cannot beforced by them. Now above and beyond this great
wheel of nature, there is yet another § wheel, within which the heavens
themfelves are turned; and herein is that great and hidden line of time,
whereby the whole world, with all its dependencies, is made to hold on
and continue its motion, unto the final end of all things; and this ilu~

pcndous wheel is God himfelf, who draws out the line o f time, andfittin g
upon the circles o f the earth, be ftretches out the heavens as a curtain, and
bcboldetb a ll the inhabitants o f the world, as grafshoppers under bis * fe e t \
and hence he difeerns, as it were, with one view, all the world naked
before him, both pail, prefent, and to come.
From what has been advanced, it appears obvious that every occurrence
of our lives, and all the various productions of nature, however ftrange
or incompreheniible they may appear, are brought to pafs by a regular
and eftabliihed means, decreed by the wifdom of God, at the begin­
ning of the w orld; and confequently, whatever happens by a contrary
effed, muft of neceflity be produced by the immediate hand of God, and
conftitutcs a miracle. Such was the cafe when the Almighty made the
fun and moon ftand Hill j and when, at the prayer of Ifaiah, he reverfed
its courfe, and made itretrograde. Such alfo were the works of our Savi­
our, when he raifed the dead, and gave light to men born blind. And fuch
was the work of God, when the fea made a lane for men to pafs through
on dry ground; and when the fire had no power to fcorch, nor to burn
thofe who walked in the midit of 'f it. Thefe miracles, it is true, had
no immediate dependence upon the works of nature; and yet, as God
from the beginning faw the neceflity of them, and the occafion upon
which they would be required, it is reafonable to fuppofe he fet down in
his eternal mind the contrivance of thefe miracles, and fo ordained them
to keep pace with the works of nature, and to come to pafs at their ap­
pointed leafons, without difturbing or deranging that univerfal frame of
the world, out of which all natural things proceed, and from whence all
the hoft 6f heaven derive their faculty of influencing earthly fubftances.
And that the heavenly bodies poflefs thefe influences, in an infinitely
powerful degree, I believe will not be denied, iince both feripture and
reafon, as we have now feen, fubftantially prove them. The ancient
philofophers were unanimous in fubferibing to this opinion, even with­
out the teftimony of the facred writings; and many very learned authors,
in later ages, have fupported the fame do&rine. Milton gives us a very
ftriking proof of his belief of the ftarry influence, in the following p a t
fage of his Paradife Loft:*

Their influence malignant when to iliow'r;
W hich of them rifing with the fun, or falling,
Should prove tempeJluous> &c. *
The ingenious Mr. Fergufon alfo proves, in a variety of inftances, an
efficiency and influence in the fun and moon, though he denies that any fuch
faculty exifts in the fixed ftars. And yet he has ihewn, by very fatisfac-
tory obfervations, that “ the fixed ftars arc fo many glorious funs, with
fyftems and worlds furrounding them, fimilar to our own j” and that
€i the Almighty would not have placed them at fuch diftances from each
other, without proper objedts were near enough to be benefited by their
influences” Hence it follows, from his own hypothefis, that the fixed
ftars do each of them poflefs a natural -f- influence, homogeneal to the fun
and moon. But to what diftance the fixed ftars, or any of the heavenly
bodies, are capable of extending thefe influences, is beyond the power of
the moft enlightened mind to deteimine ; fince the celeftial matter flows
through a boundlefs and unlimitted fpace, and operates upon every fub-
ftance that falls within the line of its diredtion. And now, having made
it apparent, by an union of concurrent teftimonies, that the fun, moon,
and ftars have their refpedtive influences, and that an Aftrology in the
heavens does by confequence exift, it will be proper to confider, how far
the ftudy of this noble fcience is compatible with our moral and religi­
ous obligations, and what degree of it is attainable by the human un-
derftunding.
That the ftudy and practice of Aftrology, is a moral purfuit, becoming
i\ber and religious men, m aybe collected from the cuftoms of the an­
cients in all enlightened countries ; as well as from the beft and wifeft of
Cod's chofen people. And that our all-wife and beneficent Creator,
originally implanted in the frame of nature, a means whereby mankind
may attain to the knowledge of fuch future contingencies as concern their
welfare and happinefs, is in no refpedt to be doubted, fince we obferve
in the brute creation, that even the moft inconliderable creatures upon
the earth, are more or lefs endowed with a gift of foreknowledge. Thus
the induftrious bee, and laborious J ant, lay in their fummer ftore, to
fupply the necefiary wants of an inclement winter, which they foreknow
is

X C f all the race of reptiles, the ant, the fpider, and the bee, appear to be endowed with
the greateft ihare of fagacity. The wifdom of the ant is confpibuous in forming thcmfelves
into a kind of republic, and therein obferving, as it were, their own peculiar laws and po­
licies ; but the cunning of the fpider feems to exceed that of moft other infers; its various
artifices to enfnare its prey, is no lefs remarkable than its contrivance of a cell or retreat
behind its web, where it feafts upon its game in fafety, and conceals the fragments of thoib
carcales it has devoured, without expoiing to public view the Icaft remains of its barbarity,
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 45
is yet to come. The badger, the hedge hog, and the mole, alio pro­
vide themfelvcs a magazine of plants and herbs, which they foreknow will
enable them to lie concealed in their holes, during the hard frofts o f
winter, contented with their prifon, which affords them fafety. Their
holes are alfo conftru&ed with amazing art, and have generally two ap~
pertures, that in cafe one is befet by an enemy, they may efcape by tne
other. The doublings of the hare, and the tricks of the fox, to efcape
the hounds, are alfo aftonifhing indications of forefight and fagacity.
The feathered race are likewife endowed with a fimilar faculty, and often
foretel an approaching ftorm a confiderable time before it appears, by re­
tiring in flocks to their holes and hiding places for ihelter and protection.
The birds of paflage feem to inherit tnis gift in a moll remarkable de­
gree; for they aflemble together in prodigious flocks, at an appointed
hour, and take their leave of us before the approach of winter, which
they forefee will deftroy the flies and other infers, upon which their own
life depends, as they feed upon nothing elfe. And it is no lefs extraor­
dinary than true, that thefe birds return as early as the fun brings forth
this clafs of infeils into new life; and they have alfo the fagacity to find out
and repoflefs their former nefts and * habitations. The fame provident
Jorecaji, for felf-prefervation and fafety, is even extended to the innumer­
able inhabitants of the immenfe ocean, where we fee the fillies, prefled
by unceafing hunger, indiferiminately prey upon one another, the large
upon the fmall, even of its own fpecies; whence the fmaller fiih, in re­
gular gradations, when in danger of being devoured, fly for an aflylum
to the (hallow waters, where they know their enemy cannot, or dares not
purfue them. And this purfuit of one fpecies of fiih after another, is by
no means confined to a Angle region; for we find ihoals of them purfu-
ing one another, f*om the vicinity of the pole, even down to the equator;
and thus the cod, from the banks of Newfoundland, purfues the whiting,
which flies before it, even to the fbuthern ihores of Spain. It is aftonifil­
ing alfo that herrings, which appear to generate towards the north of Scot­
land, regularly make their way, once a year, to the Britiih Channel.
Their voyage is conduced with the utmoft regularity; and the time of
their departure is fixed from the month of June to Auguft. They always
aflemble together before they fet out, and no ftragglers are ever found
which might diftinguiih its place of abode, or create the leaft jealoufy in any infe&, that their
enerrty was near. Into what hiftory can we look, to find people who are governed by laws
equal to what we obferve in the republic of bees ? What experience can we defire beyond that
we obferve in the cunning fpider, to teach us to guard againft the artifices of thofe, who lay
fnares, to catch the thoughtlefs and unwary? Or what can exceed the indefatigable ant, in
teaching us leflons of frugality and induftry ?—Well might the wife man fay tothe flothful and

nuted part of his works, has endued the lowed clafs of animals with a
gift of foreknowledge in what immediately concerns their fafety and
welfare; would it not be derogatory to the equal providence of God, to
iuppoie he had not ordained, in an infinitely luperior degree, a means of
v
.ommunieating foreknowledge to man, whom he hath gracioufly formed
in his own exprefs image and likenefs, and appointed lord over his vail
creation ?— A creature whom he hath endowed with a rational foul, ca­
pable of paying him adoration and worfliip; and with an underftanding
qualified to deevpher the golden characters he hath placed in the firma­
ment of heaven, forfigns o f thofe hidden events of futurity, which are
vet to come ? If we give the feriptures an attentive perufal, we fliall
find a variety of pafiages to confirm this opinion, both in the old and new
Tcilamcnt. And we may gather additional evidence, that the Almighty
1 uended we lliould fludy futurity, from the communications given to
Adam in Paradife by the angel Gabriel; as W'ell it
s from the commiiTion M i­
chael the Archangel received from God, to iliew him, in a vifion, the
principal events of futurity, from his fall, to the birth, refurredtion, and
aicention of * Chrift. And I think I am warranted to fay, from the
authority of our Saviour's own words, that there appears only one event,
concerning the human race, which the Deity ever propofed to withhold
from their knowledge, and that is, the time of the lalt and terrible day
of Judgment. But even of this aw'ful and fecret event, we are promifed
fome previous intimations, by figns in the fun, moon, J and ftars;
which are the common fignificators of all inferior tranfa&ions of futurity.
For this reafon we are told to watch , fo r no man knoveeth the hour when
thefe things Jhall come ; therefore, thofe who ftudy the fydereal fcience, by
their watchfulnefs of the heavenly bodies, and their capability of difeo-
vering fuch figns in the fun, moon, and ftars, whenever the tremendous
fiat fliall be pail, will be the firft to know that the vifitation of God is
at hand; v/hilft thofe who condemn both the fcience and its profeflors,
unprepared by any previous intimation, and folded in the arms of
incautious repofe, will find the fatal hour approach like a th ief in the

when petrified and motionlcfs, in bitter anguiili and defpair,
they will too late repent their negligence and incredulity.
Now if we confider ailrology, what it truly is, a legal and virtuous
ftudy, we may eafily believe the accounts tranfmitted to us by Jofcphus
and other hiftorians, concerning its antiquity and divine original. We
have already fcen that Adam, previous to his expuliion from Paradife, was
inftrudted in a foreknowledge of futurity, by the exprefs command of
God, as a means of enlarging his mind, and alleviating his diflrefs, upon
being turned adrift into the wide world. Jofephus, an hiftorian of cha­
racter and eminence, who quotes the moft ancient authors of refpedtability
for what he aflerts, confirms the fame thing, and further informs us, that
Adam, before his death, inftru&ed his fon Seth in this fcience, who after­
wards engraved the rudiments of it upon permanent pillars of done, which
endured through many generations, and were not entirely effaced till fome
time after the*deluge. W e have it from the fame authority, that the
Art was taught by Enos and Noah, who preferved it to the days of Abra­
ham, and he incrcafed the knowledge of it by divine aids, teaching it to
the Chaldeans and Egyptians. Jofeph is alfo faid to have patronized and
«
§ 1 would recommend a ferious and attentive perufal of thefe feriptures, to every perfon who
has doubts concerning the do&rine of Aftrology. It is here pointed out, tothe underftanding
of themoft unlettered part of mankind, that the great and terrible day of the Lord, the day of
judgment, will moft affuredlv come. Our Saviour’s difciples enquire of him, When this day
ihall be ? He replies, C
(Of tnat day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which arc
4
4 in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.” They alfo aik, What fhail be the figns
hereof? They are told, 4
4There ihall be figns in the fun, in the moon, and in the ftars ; the
' fun ihall be darkened, and the moonihall not give her light; and upon the earth diftrefs of
nations, with perplexity ; the fea and the waves roaring; with great earthquakes indivcis
S
laces, and famines, and peftilences; fearful fights and great figns ihall there alfo be in the
cavens. Watch, therefore, for in an hour when ye think not, Ihall thefe things come; for
as in the days that were before the Hood, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and giv­
ing in marriage, until the daythat Noah entered the ark; andthey knew not, until the flood
came and took them away; foalfo ihall ttie coming of the Son of man be. Then ihall he
fend forth his angels, and ihall gather together hiseled from the four winds, from the utter*
moft part of theearth, to theuttermoft part of heaven; then ihall two be in a field, the one
ihall be taken; andtheother left; twowomenihall be grinding at themill, theone ihall beta­

and direful events, are difcoverable not only by the celeftial bodies, but alfo byfe a r fu lfig hts in
the heavens ; by tremendous earthquakes; by total eclipfes of the two great luminaries, which
deprive them, for a time, of the power of giving light; and by otherextraordinary phenomena,
which ihould always be attended to with reverence and awe. Thefefign s ourSaviour informed

taught It In Egypt, and is fuppofed hv Origin, Diodorus Siculus, and
oilier ancient hiilorians, to have been the author of an ailrological work,
called, The Aphorifms of Hermes the *f*Egyptian. Mofes afterwards
taught and profelled it, independent of the gift of prophecy, which al-
wa\s came by divine infpiration, and confequently was only exercifed
upon certain extraordinary occafions. From Mofes, we are told, the Pro­
phets and Seers had i t ; and that it was afterwards particularly taught
among the tribe of Iflachar, who are on that account ftiled in the facred
writings, M en who bad undemanding in the J times, and were expert at re-
folving all queiiions concerning futurity; and as this tribe were neither
priefts nor Levites, nor endued with the fpirit of prophecy, it follows
that their underjianding in the times, and their ability in foretelling future
events, arofe entirely from an acquired knowledge of the figns and influ­
ences o f the heavenly bodies. For the fame reafon thePeriian aftrologers
were called Mages, or W ife men, who wereJkilled in the tim es; and the
Chaldeans termed their young ftudents in aftrology, M en Jkilled in wifdom
and cunning ^fcience, to learn the learning o f the Chaldeans. And after the
Chaldean method of ftudying the fcience of aftrology, Daniel, and Shad-
rach, and Mefech, and Abednego were inftrudted by their tutor Melzar,
and became ten times more learned in all matters o f wifdom and underfunding,
than all the afrologers in the realm, in confideration of which they were
eleiled members of the public * fchools at Babylon, which were founded
for the ftudy of this art; and Daniel was made, by the King’s decree,
Mailer over the Chaldean I
Iaftrologers.
In the days of Samuel, it appears to have been a common cuftom to go
to the Seers, or men of underfunding in the times, not only to be inform­
ed concerning future contingencies, but alip to enquire after loft goods.
To this effedt we find Saul and his fervant difeourfing, when they were
fun out to find the ftrayed afles of Kiih, Saul’s father; and not being able
to rind them, the fervant propofes to go and enquire of the Seer, which way
the afles were gone, and where they may be found. Saul agrees to this, but
afks, W hat have we to give him ? we have no bread left% nor have we any
fujficient prefent. The fervant replies, I have a fo u rth part o f a Jhekel o f
/¡her ; r i l give him tha t. Saul anfwerS, W ellfa id , let u s** go. This
paflage enables us to diftinguifh between the gift of prophecy, for the
purpofes of eftablifhing God’s true religion, and the art of anfwering ho­
rary queftions, and predicting future events. The one was evidently ef­
fected by fupernatural means, and promulgated to the people without

expence ; whilft the other, by being calculated for the benefit of respec­
tive individuals, was always accompanied with money or prefents. In
the fame way we find David, when in Keilah, where he heard that Saul
was coming to befiege him, was defirous of knowing the truth, whether
Saul was coming or n ot; and if he was, W hether the men o f Keilah would
be true to bim> or would betray him. And being informed they would
betray him into the hands of the enemy, who weie fecking his life, he
fled into the wildernefs of Ziph, and efcaped the danger that was im­
pending over -f- him. And in the New Teftament alfo, we have fre­
quent confirmations of the meteorological part of this fcience, from our
Saviour’s own words, in his converfation with the Pharifees, who were
all verfed in aftrology. He addreifes them to this effeit: “ When it is
“ evening, ye fay, it will be fair weather, becaufe the iky is red ; and
“ in the morning it will be foul weather, becaufe the iky is red and
4t lowering. And when a cloud arifeth out o f the weft, ftraightway ye

€t pocrites, ye can difeern the face of the || iky, but the figns of the times
€t ye cannot d i f e e r n . A n d now, if we impartially contemplate the
origin and antiquity of this fcience, and recolledt that the beft and wifeft
men in every age of the world, were profeflors of it, we muft admit its
praftice to be highly confiftcnt with all our moral and religious duties.
*
That the human underftanding is alfo capable of attaining to a very
high degree of knowledge in the hidden works of futurity, and in the
fecret operations of nature, is likewife to be proved, beyond the power
of contradiction. Indeed the paffages already quoted from the holy
feriptures, are a fufficient confirmation of it to every difpailionate reader j
but as there are fome very extraordinary iflftances of this predictive fa­
culty, recorded by different hoftorians, I will juft mention a few of
them, by way of corroborating die evidence already brought in its fup-
port. The Emperor Domitian required the Profeffor Largius Proculus,
to calculate his nativity, from the fuppofed time of his birth, which was
done, and delivered into the Emperor’s own hands. Afclatarius, a molt
famous aftrologer of thole times*, procuring a copy of this nativity, rec-,
tilled it, and foretold the hour and manner of the Emperor’s death; which
when Domitian heard, he commanded. Afclatarius to be brought before
him, when he affirmed his predictions would prove true. Domitian alk-
ed him if he could foretel the manner of his own death ? Afclatarius re­
plied, That he knew he Ihould ftiortly be tom in pieces by dogs •
, but to
confute the aftrologer, the Emperor ordered him to be burnt alive. The
cruel fentence was accordingly put in execution ; the body was bound and

5o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
laid upon the pile, and the fire kindled ; but at that inftant, there arofe a
dreadful ftorm of wind and rain, which drove the fpedtators away, and
extinguiihed the fire ; and Afclatarius was afterwards torn in pieces by
dogs, as he had foretold. When Latinus informed the Emperor of this
event, he was greatly mortified, and very melancholy ; and on the day his
affaffination had been predi&ed, he feigned himfelf indifpofed, and locked
himfelf up in his chamber. Stephanus, the captain of his guard, went to
his door, pretending he had received fome important difpatches, which
he wanted to deliver to him ; but Domitian declining to admit him till a
certain hour was pail, Stephanus perfuaded him it was then much later
than the time fpecified. The Emperor, in confequence, concluding the
danger to havepaffedby with the hour, or looking upon the predi&ion as a
mere fable, feeing no confpiracy or danger about him, opened the door,
upon which Stephanus ftept up to him with a drawn dagger, and ilabbcd
him to the heart, in the very hour that had been predicted by the aftro-
loger, on the eighteenth day of September, the monthjhe had ordered to
be called* Germanicus. The fame writers add, that Apollonius Tyaneus
was at that iiiftant of time at Ephcfus, flanding in the prefence of the
Magiftratcs, and in a kind of ecftacy, cried out, O Stephanus, ilrike the
tyrant; and after a paufe, added, *Tis well, thou haft killed him. This art
o f redifying nativities, was a difeovery which brought the fcience to very
liigh perfedion, and has enabled its profeffors to be aftoniihingly exad in
prédirions o f confequence. Thus Lucius Tarutius Firmianus, by the
ads of Romulus's life, and the time o f his death, found that he was born
in the firft year of the fécond Olympiad, the twenty-third day of the
month, about fun-riling. And hence he difeovered that the building of
Rome was begun when the moon was in Libra, the fun with Mercury, and
Venus in Taurus, Jupiter in Pifces, and Saturn with Mars in -f* Scorpio.
The Archbiihop o f Pifa confulted fcveral different profeffors of aftrology
concerning his deftiny, and they all calculated his nativity at different
times, and without any communication with one another ; but they all
foretold him he would be hanged. It feemed highly incredible at the
time, becaufe he was in fomuch honour and power; but the event juftified
the predictions ; for in the fcdition of Pope Sextius IV . in the fudden
rage and uproar of the people, he was lcized and $ hanged. Petrus
Leontius, a celebrated phylician and aftrologerof Spoletanum, call his own
nativity, and foretold that his death would be occalioned by water, and
many years afterwards he was found drowned in a pond, into which he had
fallen the preceding night, by miftaking his § way. Jofephus tells us
he caft the nativities o f Vefpatian, and his fon Titus, and predicted that
they would both be Emperors ; and fo it turned out. R . Cervinus

calculated the nativity of his fon Marcellus, and foretold that he fhould
come to great preferment and dignity in the church ; and his mother
afterwards entreating him to marry one Caffandra Bcnna, he very refo-
lutely declined it, faying, He would not with the bands of matrimony, bind
himfelf from that better fortune which theftars had promifed him, if
he continued to live Angle and unmarried. And he was afterwards really
made Pope *. Picus Mirandula was a fevere writer againft aftrology,
infomuch that he was termed, Flagellum Aftrologorum; and to ftop the
malignity of his pen, Lucius Bcllantius, and two other aftrologers of
eminence, procured the time of his birth, and calculated his nativity,
which they afterwards fent him, with this predidtion inclofed, “ That he
would die in the thirty-third year of his age.” This exafperated him fo
much, that he began to write a new tradt, with inconceivable afperity,
againft the poor aftrologers, attempting to prove their calculations a mere
bubble, and themfelves a fet of impoftors. But when the fatal ap­
pointed hour arrived, he faw the folly of his own conceits; recanted his
opinion, and fealed by his death, a {landing memorial of the inerrability
and truth of this -fcience. Many other extraordinary circumftances of
the kind might be related from different authors, were it not already
fufficiently obvious that the intelledtyal faculties of man, when culti­
vated by ftudy, and improved by obfervation and experience, are capable
of attaining a very exteniivc degree of knowledge and ikill in this art.
W e w ill therefore difmifs this argument, and endeavour to explain what
the fubjedls are, that the fcience of aftrology naturally comprehends.
Aftrology is compounded of Jlar, and difcourfey and literally
implies, l!he doctrine o f the J ia rs; teaching how to judge of their effe&s,
and fecret influences, and to foretel future events, by the order of their
different afpedts, qualities, and pofitions ; and alfo how to difeover their
energy and force upon earthly fubftances, in the wonderful and abftrufe
operations o f nature. It comprehends the moft excellent part of that
noble fcience called Phyfiology, or natural Philofophy, which is the doc­
trine o f natural bodies, in the conftrudtion of the works of nature. T he
body natural may be conceived either generally, as one perfett and entire
body; or ipecially, as it may d>e divided into two, or fubdivided into
many thouiand component parts. This grand and perfedt body of na­
ture is called the World, or the whole world, which is generally confi-
dered as making but one entire body; but this general body admits o f
many fpecial divilions and fubdivifions -
y and is firft divided into two
* Vid. Thuan. 1. 1j. It is remarkable that this prtdidion was printed at Venice, and pub-
lifhed by Curtins Trojanus, in a book of nativities written by Gauricus, upwards of three
years before Marcellas Cervinus was proclaimed Pope. And this is that Pope, who when the
Lc&urer, as the cuftom was, read a certain portion of the writings of the Fathers at dinner
time, faid, “ He could conceive how thofc who held fo high a place, could provide
for their own falvation,”
l branches,
$2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
branches, making one body natural called Celeftial, and another called
Terreftrial; and hence arife two diilindt fciences, the one termed U ri­
nology, and the other Geology.
Geology is a fcience treating of the natural body called the earth, and
fpeaks either generally of the whole earth, or fpecially of the parts, or fome
(^articular part thereof; and is either fpcculativc, or pradtical. Specu-
ative Geology confifts in the fimple inveftigation of the earth, either
in whole, or in part, and of the principles and afiedtions thereof; and to
this purpofe it treats either of the common being of any earthly thing,
merely as it is a being abftradt from all matter, whether intelligible, or
fenfible; and as it operates thus, it is termed Metaphyfical, or Preter­
natural Philofophy. But if it difcourfcs of a movable being in matter,
and that as it is perfedtly material, it is then called Natural Philofophy.
Or if it fpeaks of things converfant in matter intelligible, but not fen-
iible, as they are the abftradts of matter, it is named Mathematical, or
Abftradt Philofophy. O f this fort of fcience the fubjedt is Quantity,
and is either continued, or dilcreet. If of continued quantity, it is
called Geometry, or its fubordinate, Perfpedtive; but if the quantity be
difcreet, it is then termed Arithmetic, or its fubordinate, Mufic. Na­
tural Philofophy properly fo called, treats of terreftrial bodies, either
fimple or mixed. The fimple bodies confift of the four elements,
called Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, which occupy all places from the
utmoft and inferior bodies of the heavenly matter, unto the inmoft cen­
tre of the earth; fo that vacuum no where exifts under the cope of
heaven. The mixed bodies are compounded of thefe four elements, and
are divided into animate, and inanimate bodies. And all animate bodies
are endued either with a vegetive, fenlitive, or rational faculty. Now
while we ftudy the dodtrine of this earthly body natural, the fciences of
Geography, Hiftory, and Chronology, naturally flow from it ; the firft
o f which deferibes the fituation and boundaries of the different parts of
the earth ; the fecond relates the ftory of whatever has been feen or
tranfadted upon i t ; and the third computes and adjufls all the different
;m s and portions of time, from the creation of the world, to the pre-
fent hour. And fubordinate to thefe are Topography, or a defeription of
particular places, and Chronologies of certain diftindt periods of time.
Pradtical Geology, is that part of natural philofophy which confifts in
Speculation, for the profit and advantage of mankind ; and leaves a track
or fruit of its operation remaining, when the adt itfelf is paft and gone.
And this is a fort of ftudy claifed under die denomination of Art, rather
than of Science. The fubjedt of it muft be either Man himfelf, or fome
fubordinate fubftance. If Man be the fubjedt of inveftigation, then the
objedt will be to teach him precepts of morality; and this we call
Ethical
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 53
Ethical Philofophy; or elfe to inflrudt him in the Art of Reafoning, called
Logical Philofophy ; or in the Art of Speaking, which we term Gram­
matical, or Rhetorical Philofophy. But if the Speculation be upon any
fubordinate fubftance, then the Earth itfelf, or the productions of it,
become the fubjedt of investigation. If it be the Earth, then the bufi-
nefs we contemplate, is to improve and cultivate the foil, for the cn-
creafe of ufeful vegetation, which is called Agriculture ; but if it be the
productions of the earth, then the ftudy muft be fo to prepare and manu­
facture them, as to render them the eifentials of Health, W ealth, Food,
or Cloathing; or whatever elfe is conducive to the comforts or neceffi-
ties of mankind. And thefe are feverally diftinguifhed by as many iig-
nificant Terms, as there are occupations or employments, by the inven­
tion and ufe of which all thefe things are produced.
Uranology is a Science which treats of the natural body of Heaven,
after the fame manner as Geology deferibes that of the Earth ; and fpeaks
either generally, of the whole Heaven ; or fpecially, of fome particular
or diftindt part of it. And as Uranology is a part of Phyfiology, fo has
it the fame principles, whether internal, as Matter and Form ; or ex­
ternal, as the caufes Efficient and Final j and thefe are Principles of their
own nature;* as Chance and Fortune are Principles by accident. It hath
alfo affections internal, as Motion and Reft, and Finity and Infinity ;
and the fame external, as Tim e and Place. Uranology is alfo either
fpeculative, or practical. Speculative Uranology coniifts in the Ample
knowledge of the Heavens, either in whole or in part, and of their
various Principles and Affedtions; and to this purpofe it lpeaks of thefe
things either Mathematically, or Naturally. Mathematically, it treats
of Aftronomy, or Uranometry, which is a feience that points out the
magnitude, meafure, and motion of the heavens, and of the ftars there­
in ; and Naturally, it defines the qualities, motions, afpedts, and opera­
tions of the heavenly Bodies, and all their apparent and infenfible in­
fluences. Pradtical Uranology is that fublime Art, which being once
perfedtly known, and rightly underftood, enables a man, by his ikill in
the affedtions of the Heavens and heavenly Bodies, to unbofom the rc-
moteft tranfadtions of futurity, and to trace the myfterious and moil
obfeure operations of Nature to their fource; whence he defines the in­
nate principles and virtues of all animal, vegetable, and mineral fub-
ftances, and points out their refpedtive uies, for the lafting profit and
advantage of mankind.
Having thus ihewn what tile word Aftrology imports, and arranged its
component parts by the rules of Science, it will be feen that its colla­
teral branches are lb extenlive and multitudinous, that moil men, of any
learning
5
4 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N
learning or ingenuity at all, are fome way or other converfant in Aftro-
logy, without appearing to know it. But 4the perverfenefs of human
nature is in this inliance moil ftrikingly vifible, fince it leads mankind
t j a choice of inferior fpeculations, whilft they utterly neglett an invefti-
gation of thole curious, indiícernible, infenfible, and impalpable tracks
o f nature, which open to a field of unbounded information, calculated to
reform the mind, and enlarge the underftanding; and to extirpate the
feeds of atheifm, by leading to the moil fublime and heavenly contem­
plations of a Supreme Being. The common objettions againil engaging
in this elevated iludy, are equally abfurd and ridiculous ; but they pro­
ceed only from thofe men who w ilfully neglett, or obilinately perlift in
a difbelief of Nature’s fecret and imperceptible w orks,* and yet her ope­
rations are fo manifeft, and fo often confirmed by fatal experience, that
it is aftonilhing mankind are not more frequently awakened by them*
Thus wc fee a man inftantaneouily taken off, by a violent and feverilh
diitemper, and yet no one can poifibly conceive how or from what caufe
it proceeds; nor can the moll able phyfician, by any depth of medical (kill,
point out its genuine caufe, fo as to fhew that another man under the
fame fymptoms, fhall be feized with juft fuch another diforder. But
look into the lick man’s nativity, by the rules of aftrology, and there
you will moll apparently fee the root and caufe of his affliftion. And
hence wc demonftrably prove, that it was not fo much the effett o f
catching cold, or of any accident, which brought on the malady, but
the evil influence of fome malignant afpett, that unperceived and unfuf-
petted gave the fatal blow, while a cold, or fome trifling accident, were
but mere inftruments; for another man fhall have a worfc cold, and
fcarcely find himielf the leaft feverilh, or expofed to danger*
Thus we find aftrology comprehends every operation that proceeds out
o f the mailer-wheel or frame of Nature, and furnilhes us with a know­
ledge of the occult virtues of all earthly fubftances, and of the nature and
end of every particle of God’s Creation y and to minds that can relilh
enjoyments fuperior to thofe of fenfe, nothing can furnilh more noble
and exalted pleafures, than a contemplation and iludy of thefe immenfe
w orks; while nothing furely can give greater proofs of an abjett and
contracted mind, than to be daily converfant with, and yet ftupidly in-
l'enlible of the amazing miracles of nature. The fun, moon, and liars,
were not made by a wife and beneficent Creator, that the wonders of
them ihould open themfelves to eyes that fee not, or difplay their in­
fluences unregarded, to the incurious inhabitants of the earth. It was in­
deed principally for the pleafure of Him by whom all things exift, that
they are and were created ¿ who rejoiceth in his works— in furveying that
itrutturc which omnipotence alone could raife > but they are likewile de-
O F A S T R O L O G Y . $s
figned to communicate wifdom and happinefs, and intellectual and mo­
ral improvement to mankind. And to him who is not barely fatisfied
with an external admiration o f things, they will fuggeft fuch reflections
as will make him both wifer and better; for at the fame time that they
feaft his imagination, they will enlarge his underftanding, and meliorate his
heart. Whatever part o f the works of nature we caft our eyes upon, we lhJ)
find imprinted therein ample leflons of inftru&ion and improvement.
W ould we contemplate the inexpreflible greatnefsand majefty of God, let
us but lookup and furvey the heavens, which are fpread over us like a cur­
tain ; they declcCfe the glory o f God, andJhew fo r th his handy work— they vifi -
bly ihew it forth to the rude and illiterate; but the mind which is fraught
with this compreheniive ftudy, may for ever expand itfelf in the immeniity
c f the profpeCt. Even the irrational and inanimate part of the creation,
are held forth by the wifdom of God, to direCt the feeings of Reafon in
the way that they ihould g o ; and our Saviour in his parables defeends to
the lifelefs emblems of feed fown, of the fig-tree, and of a Angle grain
o f muftard feed, to enlighten the underftanding of mankind* Is it not then
the duty of every rational creature to improve by this divine example, and
by a ftudy of that excellent part o f aftrology called natural philofophy,
to increafe our imperfeCt Knowledge in the fubjeCts of creation ? Suck
knowledge as this lies open even to the wayfaring man ; it grows in every
field, and meets us in all our paths; and as it is moft important to be
well underftood by the reader, before any material* progrefs can be made
in the ailrology of the heavens, I (hall conclude thefe obfervations with,
a ihort introduction to the ftudy of Nature..

bodies to receive their influence ; therefore every active principle mufl of
ncceflity be in motion, and every paffivc principle mull be at refl. And
accordingly, as the a&ive elements find the earth that they adt upon
to be pure, or impure, fo w ill the work be that is produced. The
- earth can bring forth nothing o f itfelf, but is the womb or matrix into
which the other elements diftil or projedt their feminal virtues; and in
proportion as it is impregnated’ by their force and energy, it brings forth,
according to the due courfe of nature. The Earth alfo receives the ce-
leftial rays and influences of all the heavenly bodies, as ordained by God,
to be the objedt, fubjedt, and receptacle of them; whereby it not only
brings forth what is intended to be produced, but alfo multiplies what
it receives, and feparates the good from the bad, and the pure from the
impure. It likewiie contains the feeds or feminal virtues of all elemen­
tary bodies, and hath a triplicity in itfelf, viz. mineral, animal, and ve-
getive. It is the common fountain or mother from whence all things
ipring, whofe fruitfulnefs is produced by the three-fold operation of fire,
air, and water. And as thefe elementary bodies poflefs moil extraordi­
nary qualities, it will be proper to confider each of them diitindtly, and
to explain their feveral properties more at large.
Fire, the firil adtivc element, is an elaitic body, compofed of infinite­
ly fmall particles, fcarcely, if at all, adhering to each other, and a body in
motion. It is in effedt, the univerfal inilrument of all the motion and
adtion in the univerfe; without fire, all bodies would become immove­
able, as in a fevere winter we adtually fee our fluids become folid for want
o f it. Without fire a man would harden into a ftatue, and the very air
would cohere into a firm rigid mafs. Fire then is the foie caufe of all
mutation or change; for all mutation is by motion, and all motion by
fire. Upon the abfence of only a certain degree of fire, all oils, fats,
waters, wines, ales, fpirits of wine, vegetables, and animals, become
hard, rigid, and inert; and the lefs the degree of fire, the fooner is this
induration made. Hence, if there were the greateil degree of cold, and
all fire was abfolutely taken away, all nature would grow into one con­
crete body, folid as gold, and hard as diamond; but upon the re-ap­
plication of fire, it would recover its Former mobility. So that upon
this one element of fire, depends all fluidity of humours and juices; alfo
all vegetation, putrefadtion, fermentation, animal heat, and a thoufand
other things. Fire is in itfelf but one, though it centers in divers places.
It centres in the heavens, and is boundlefs, where it guards and pre-
ferves nature, and enlivens all the creation, giving life, light, and mo­
tion to all creatures, and llirs them up to fecundity and fruitfulnefs. It
centres alfo in the earth, where it generates metals, minerals, and (tones;
and by joining itfelf with the beams of the celeftial fun and moon, pro­

A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
duces vegetation upon the furface of the earth. It occaiions that heat
we fomctimes obferve in fprings and fountains ; and imparts a principle
o f its own into whatever it produces, fo that whatfoever retains life, re­
tains it by virtue of its own inclofed heat; and whenever this is exhauft-
ed or extinguiihed, it periihes and dies. And as water purgeth, cleanfeth*
and diflolveth all things that are not fixed, fo fire purgeth and perfefteth
all things that are fixed ; and as water conjoins all things that are dif-
folved, fo fire feparates all things that are conjoined; it caufes all feeds to
grow and ripen; and when they are ripe, it expels them by the fperm
into divers places of the earth ; and as the fituation and temperature o f
thefe places are, whether hot or cold, moift or dry, pure or impure, 'fo
w ill the diverfity of things be both in the bowels, and upon the furface of
the earth. But amongft all the wonderful properties of fire, there are
none more extraordinary than this, That though it is the principal caufe
o f almoft all the fenfible efiefts that continually fall under our obferva-
tion, yet it is in itfelf of fo infinitely a fubtle nature, that it baffles or de­
feats our moil fagacious enquiries, nor ever comes within the cogni­
zance of our fenfes. .
Fire may be divided into three kinds or fpecies, viz. celeftial, fubterra-
neous, and culinary. Celeftial fire is that which.is peculiar to the celeftial
regions, where it exifts in the greateft purity and perfedtion, unmixed
with fmoke, or any of that grofs, feculent, or terreftrial matter, found in
culinary and fubterranean fire $ but allowing for this difference, the effects
o f the celeftial fire appear to be the fame as thofe of the culinary. Sub­
terraneous fire is that which manifefts itfelf in fiery eruptions of the earth,
volcanoes, or burning mountains, and is always found in the more central
parts of the earth, and often in mines and coal-pits. Culinary fire is that
which we employ in all chemical operations, and in the common occaiions
o f life. T o afeertain the force and power of fire, the learned Boerhaave
made innumerable curious experiments, which enabled him to divide it
into fix degrees. The firft degree is that by which nature performs the
office of vegetation in plants, and by which chcmiftry imitates and does
the like. This commences from the higheft degree of cold, which in
Fahrenheit’s thermometer is denoted by one, and ends at eighty degrees;
lince in this whole interval vegetables of one kind or other give indication
of life and growth; fo that if all plants be examined by the degrees of
heat contained within thefe limits, we ihall find all of them come to ma­
turity in one or other o f thefe intermediate degrees. This heat is fuited
to extracting the native fpirits o f odoriferous vegetables with oils, as that
of rofes, jelfamin; and the like. Thus the fragrant feentof rofes maybe
communicated to oil, by putting the inodorous and infipidoil of olives in-a
tall clean chemical glafs, and digefting it in a heat of fifty-fix degrees,
with
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 59
with the moil fragrant rofes, gathered juft as they are opening in a morn­
ing ; the application of a fimilar degree of heat would alfo impregnate
alcohol with the pureft fpirit of faffron. The fecond degree of fire may
be accounted that of the human body, in a healthy ftate. This degree is
always greater than that of the ambient aiy* and may be fuppofed to
commence at the 40th degree of the thermometer, and end about the
94th. Within this*compafs animals may live and fubfift, that is, if their
juices be of any degree of heat within thefe bounds. The eggs of infedls
fubfift unhurt during hard winters, and hatch in the fucceeding fpring.
Fifties both of the fea and of rivers, live in water which is only thirty-
four degrees warm ; and fifties that have lungs, and all refpiring animals
in a ftate of health, communicate U* their humours a warmth of ninety-two
degrees; and therefore the uttttofl limits of this degree are fixed at thirty-
three and ninety-four. W ithin the compafs of this heat are included the
vital aitions of animals, the fermentation of vegetables, and the putre­
faction both of vegetables and animals; and likewife the generation,
breeding, hatching, birth, and nutrition of animals. This degree is alfo
employed by chemifts to prepare elixirs, volatile alkaline falts, and tinc­
tures. The third degree of fire is that which extends from ninety- four
degrees of the thermometer to 212, at which laft, water ufually boils.
This degree is required in the diftillation of Ample and compound wa­
ters, the eflential oils of vegetables 5 and will coagulate or consolidate the
ferum, blood, and other animal juices, and confequently deftroy life.
The fourth degree of heat may be reckoned from the degree 212 to 600;
within which limits all oils, faline lixivia, mercury, and oil of vitriol are
diftilled; lead and tin will alfo melt and mix together. The oils, falts,
and faponaceous juices of animals and vegetables are rendered volatile and
acrid, and become more orlefs alealefeent; their folid parts are calcined,
and lofe their diftinguifhing qualities and proper virtues; and with this
degree of fire, foflil fulphur and fal armoniac are fublimed. The fifth
degree is that wherein the other metals melt, and which commences from
fix hundred degrees of the thermometawgnd ends where iron is held in a
ftate of fufion. In this degree moil b o U l are deftroyed; butglafs, gold,
filyer, copper, and iron, remain long unchanged * all other fixed bodies
grow red hot in this degree, and all the unvitrifiable ilonesare calcined.
The fixth and higheft degree of fire hitherto known, is that of the burn­
ing lens, or fpeculum^ by M . Villette, Tfchirnhaufen, Buffon, and others.
The focus o f thefe lenfes will even volatilize what is called the metalline
or mercurial part of gold, and vitrify the more terreilrial. The utmofl
degree of fire is the vitrification of fixed bodies, which the ancient magi,
or the aitrologers of the eail difeovered j and they predicted the final
end of the world by fire, and its mutation into tranfparent glafa *•

Air is the next adtive element that engages our attention, and it is di­
vided into proper or elementary, and common x
>
rheterogeneous. Elementary
air, properly io called, is a lubtile, homogeneous* elailic matter ; the baiis
or fundamental ingredient of common air, and that which gives it the
denomination. It likewi&xnters into the compofition of moft or perhaps
all bodies, and exifts in them under a folid form, deprived of its elal-
ticity, and moft of its diftinguiihiag properties, and ferving as the ce­
ment, and univerfal bond of nature; but capable, by certain procefles*
o f being difengaged from them, recovering its elafticity, and refembHng
the air of our atmofphere. The peculiar nature of this aerial matter we
know but little o f; what authors have advanced concerning it being
chiefly conjectural. W e have no way o f altogether feparating it from the
other matter, with which, in its pureft ftate, it is more or iefs combined*
and confequently no way of afeertaining, with fatisfadtory evidence, its
peculiar properties, abftradtedly from thofe of other bodies. Philofophers*
both ancient andmodern maintain, with great plaufibility, that it is the fame
with the pure ether, or that fine, fluid, adlive matter, diffufed through the
whole expanfe of the celeftial regions, and of the interior heavens; and
is fuppofcd to be a body fu i generis, ingcnerable, incorruptible* immuta­
ble, prefent in all places, and in all bodies. *
Common, or heterogeneous air, is a coalition o f corpufclcs of various
kinds, which together conftitute one common mafs, wherein we live and
move, and which we are continually receiving and expelling by refpiration.
The whole afiemblage of this makes what we call the atmojphere; and
where this air or atmofphere ends, there the pure ether is fuppofed to
commence, which is diftinguiihed from air* by its not making any fenli-
fcle refradtion of the rays o f light, as air does. T his common air, fays
the ingenious M r. Boyle, is the moft heterogeneous body in the uuiverfe ;
and Boerhaave fhews it to be an univer&l chaos, or colluvies* o f all kinds
of created bodies. Bcfide the matter of light or fire, which continually
flows into it from the heavenly Indies, and probably the magnetic effluvia
of the earth, whatever fire can i® fcilize, is found in the air. Hence the
whole foiffl kingdom muft be found in i t ; for all of that tribe* as falts*
fulphurs, ftoncs, and metals, are convertible into fume* and thus capable
of being rendered part of the air. Gold itfelf* the moft fixed of all na­
tural bodies, is found to adhere clofe to,the fulphur in mines* and thus to
be raifed along with it. Sulphurs alfo make a confiderable ingredient o f
the air, on account of the many volcanoes* grottos* caverns* and other
fpiracles, chiefly affording that mineral* difperfed through the globe. A ll
parts of the animal kingdom muft alfo be in the air; for* bcfide the co­
pious effluvia continually emitted from their bodies* by the vital heat* in
the ordinary procefs of perfpifation, by means of which an animal* in the
’ courfc
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 61
courfe of its duration, impregnates the air with many times the quantity
of its own body; we find that «any animal when dead, being expofed to
the air, is in a certain time wholly incorporated with it*. As to vegeta­
bles, none o f that clafs can be wanting in the contribution of their effluvia
to the common air, fincc we know that all vegetables, by putrefadtion,
become volatile. The aflociations, reparations, attritions, diffolutions,
and other operations of one fort of matter upQn another, may likewife be
confidered as fources o f numerous other neutral, or anonymous bodies, un­
known to the moil inquifitive naturalift. Thus air is one of the moil con-
• This fa£l is proved in avery ftrtking manner, by anextraordinary effedfcproduced by thofe
dead bodies, after they became filled with air, which were unfortunately drowned in the Royal
George, at Spithead, on the 29th of Auguft, 1782. This (hip was heeled on her fide for the
purpofe of fome repair, when the water ruihed into her lower port-holes, and funk her almoft
jnftantaneoufly. She went down in fourteen fathom water, and fell upon her fide, as was evi­
dent from her top-malls, wftich remained above the water, in an inclined dire&ion. A confi-
derable time after this fatal accident, {he fuddenly righted, and her mads became nearly perpen­
dicular. No one could account for this extraordinary tranfa&ion, which was eiFe&ed without
any apparent caufe; and it remained forfome time a circumftance equally aftonifhing and in­
explicable. At length fome very able anonymous writer publifbed the following ingenious and
correct folution of it.
“ By the mutter-roll of this unfortunate fhip, it appears that 495 fouls periflied between her
“ decks; and as the bodies had no way to eicape, they of courfe remained inthat fituation.
“ Now all bodies in adate of putrefaction ferment, and this fermentation generates largequan­
tities of air, fo that a putrifying carcafe, inflated by the generation of air, expands itfelf to a
fize farexceeding its original bulk, andbecomes lighter than water in a very high degree; and
will confequently be preded upwards towards the furface, with a power equal to the weight
of a quantity of water, adequate in bulk tothe inflated carcafe; and would rife immediately
to the furface in a perpendicular line, if not obflru&ed in its paflage. Now it is obvious
that the 409 carcafes. which lay between the decks until fermentation and putrefa&ion
commenced, would rife as foon as the generated air rendered them fpeciflcally lighter than
fea water: and as fermentation increafed their bulk, they would by their expanfion,
remove a quantity of water from between the decks, on the loweft fide of the fhip (to
which by their gravity they would naturally incline when their breath firft left them)
equal to their encrealed bulk; apd being then a&ed upon by the upwardprefiure of the
water, would exert agaiqft the under-part of the decks, immediately over them, a power like-
wife equal to fuch weight of water as.equate their eneveafed bulk. The hewieft fide
of the ihip, being thus firft lightened by the displacing fo largea quantity of water, and
exchanging it for air¿ and then a&ed upon by the ’preflure of the water upwards againfl the
under fide of the inflated carcafes, lifting hard agaimftthe decks on or beneath the center of
the ihip; and farther by the preflure of the water upwards, againft the underfide of the
hulls, mails, &c. together with the counterpoife of a large weight of water between decks»
on the higheft fide, would caufe her to be nearly inEquilibrio; and confequently, the firft
ftroQg tide (as was the cafe) would fwing her onher keel, andright her.
tc To ihew that 49$ bloatedcarcafes mighthave power fufficient to produce fo ftrange a phe­
nomenon, let us fuppofb each carcafe¿t that time equal to a twenty gallon cafk, ana it could
be nolets, for when in aftateof putrefa&ion, notonly the abdomen.andthorax»but even the
fmalleft veil'd in the human frame, becomes inflatedby the vapourgeneratedin fermentation;
fo that the limbs fwell to the extremities, and become buoyant, which makes the eftimate of
twenty gallons per carcafe lefs perhaps than the truth.

fulciuble and univerfal agents in all nature, being concerned in the prefer-
\<ition of life, and the production of moil of the phenomena relating to
this world. Its properties and effects, including a great part of the re-
K.tubes and difeoveries* of the modern philofophers, have in a confiderable
degree been reduced to Jtfgcife laws and demonftrations ; in which form
they make a very exteenye and important branch of the mixed mathe­
matics, called Pneumatics; for a moreperfedt knowledge of which, I beg
leave to recommend the curious reader to Dr. Prieftley's invaluable E x­
periments and Obiervations on different kinds of air. But I iliall juft
obierve further, that to the preflure of air, we arc to attribute the cohe-
ience of the parts of bodies. Breathing too, on which depends animal
hfe, is owing to the preflure and ipring of the air; and to the fame
caufe may be attributed the production of fire and flame, as appears from
t h e h i d d e n extinction of Are when deprived of air. It is likewife necef-
iary for the exiftence and propagation of founds, for the germination and
growth of plants, for conveying all the variety of fmells, and for re­
ceiving and tranfmitting the rays and influences of the celeftial world, to
the terreftrial. Air adts upon all bodies by its common properties of
weight and elafticity, and by the peculiar virtues of the ingredients where­
o f it is compoled. Thefe properties of weight and elafticity in the air,
when engendered in large quantities in the bowels o f the earth, and
heated bv the fubterranean fire, occafions earthquakes, and other vehe­
ment commotions of nature. And by fome late experiments of M . de la
Hire, it is found that a certain quantity of condenfed air, if heated to a
degree equal to that of boiling water, will produce an explofion fuffi-
tient to tear afunder the folid globe. By means of a corroding acid, air
diffolves iron and copper, unlefs well defended by o il; even gold in the
chcmift's laboratory, when the air is impregnated with the effluvia of aqua
regia, cgpptra&s a ruft like other bodies. It Axes volatile bodies, and vo­
latilizes thofe which are fixed. From the different effluviae diffufed
through the air, proceed a variety of effefts. Near mines of copper, it
will difcolour filver and brafs; and in London, where the air abounds
with acid and corrofive particles, metalline utenfils ruft much fooner than
in the country. Stones alfo undergo the changes incident to metals.
Thus Purbeck Atone, of which Saliibury cathedral is built, is obferved
to become gradually fofter, and to moulder away in the air; and M r.
Boyle gives the fame account qf Blackington ftone. It is very difficult
to obtain oil o f fulphur in a clear dry air, as its parts are then more ready
to evaporate ; but in a moift cloudy air, it may be obtained in ^f^idance.
A ll falts melt moft readily in cloudy weather; and fejparations priSfeibd belt
in the fame ftate of the air. I f pure wine be carried into a place where the
air is full of the fumes of wine then fermenting, it will begin to ferment
a-frefh. The wholefomenefs and unwholefomenefs of .air, is certainly
. owing
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 6;
v"
owing to the different effluvia with which it abounds. The heft air is to
be found in open champaign countries» where the foil is dry, and fpon-
taneo'ufly produces wild thyme, wild marjoram, and the like fweet-
fcented plants. The morning air is more refrtihing than that of the even­
ing, and air agitated with breezes, than tfcatfWhich is ferenc and ftill.
As good air contributes greatly to health, fi^that which is bad or in-
fe&ious, is no lefs prejudicial to it, as is evident in contagious difeafes,
plagues, murrains, and other mortalities, which are fpread by an infetted
air. But this infeiled air may be corredted, and the body preferved frctn
its fatal effects, by the effluvia of aromatic and ftrong-fcented herbs and
flowers. From obfervations on bleeding in rheumatifms, and after tak­
ing cold, it is evident the air can enter with all its qualities, and vitiate
the whole texture of the blood, and other juices. From palfies, verti­
goes, and other nervous affe£tions, caufed by damps, mines, &c. it is
evident that air thus qualified, can relax and obftrutt the whole nervous
fyitem. And from the cholics, fluxes, coughs, and confumptions pro­
duced by damp, moift, and nitrous air, it is evident it can corrupt and
fpoil the noble organs of the whole human ftrufture. Thus air is an
inftrument which nature is universally applying in all her works §, con-
fequently a knowledge of its properties feems highly neceffary not only
to the chemift and phyfician, but to the philofopher and divine.
Water, the third aftive element, is the menftruum of the world, and
is of two kinds; firft, Pure Water, which is a limpid, and colourlefs li­
quor, without fmell or tafte, Ample and volatile, and is peculiar to the
celeftial regions. Secondly, Grofs Water, which is a pellucid fluid, con­
vertible into ice by cold, naturally pervading the ftrata of the earth, and
flowing on its furface, and with* the body of the earth, conllitutes the
terraqueous globe. The figure of the component parts of water appears
to be fmooth and fphcrical, like thofeof quicklilver; whence it becomes
extremely moveable and penetrating. Thus it readily enters the pores o f
wood, leather, lkins, chords, and mufical firings, and is capable of
moving and agitating particles of matter lefs adtive than itfe lf; and fo
proves the more immediate phyfical agent of fermentation, putrefaction,
folution, and the lik e ; and thiis it alfo conveys earthy and faline matter
through filtres of paper, ftone, &c. and even raifes fome proportion of
them in diftillations. Its particles appear to be extremely minute, and
fo have a large fhaie of furface. Hence water is admirably fitted for a

iolvent, or for readily entering the pore« of falts, and coming into full
contact with all their particles; and thus it will pafs where air cannot, on
account of its moifture, or lubricating power, whereby it faftens muci­
laginous matters, and w ilf therefore foak through the clofe pores of a
bladder. It penetrates ^tmofphere very copioufly, by means of the
continual dillillations of thtrpcean and rivers, raifed up by the heat of
the central fun, and draws along with it a warm undtious vapour, which
caufes a natural generation of whatever the earth, as a matrix, is impreg­
nated with. Water always contains an earthy fubftance, and is found in
the hardeft bodies, and in the drieft air. It is the proper menftruum
of falts, and by the readinefs with which it imbibes the different
kindsof air, iseafily rendered, by a lately diicovered chemical procefs, to
poiTefs the lame qualities and virtues of the moft efteemed mineral waters
hitherto difeovered. Water is alfo of infinite u/e in all the works both
o f nature and art, as without it there could be no generation, nutri­
tion, or accretion performed in any of the animal, vegetable, mine­
ral, marine, or atmofpherical regions. The blood could not flow in the
veins, the fap in the veflels of vegetables, nor the particles of minerals
concrete andjjrow together, without water. It is this that makes the
largeft part of our blood, our drink, and other aliments. There could
be no corruption, fermentation, or diffolution carried on without i t ; no
brewing, no diftilling, no wines, no vinegar, no fpirits, made without
it. W e alfo meet with water under an infinite variety of forms, and in an
infinite variety of bodies, as that of air, vapour, clouds, fnow, hail, ice,
fap, wines, blood, fleih, bone, horn, ftone, and other bodies, through
all which it feems to pafs unaltered, as an agent or inftrument that fuf-
fers po alteration by re-adtion, but remains capable of refuming the form
of water again upon any occafion. In its own common ilate, water ap­
pears to be a combination of all the elements together, as containing a
quantity of fire, which keeps it fluid; a quantity of air, and a quantity
of earth; whence it is not at all furprifing, that water alone, as it appears
to the fenfes, fhould fuffice for vegetation in fome cafes, where little
earth is wanted, or for iupporting animal and mineral life, .where no great
degree of nutriment is required; and hence it proves a glue or cement to
fome bodies, and a folvcnt to others; thus it confolidates brick, plaifter
o f Paris, itone, bone, and the like; but diffolves falts, and fubtile earth
approaching to falts, and becomes the inftrumental caufe o f their adtion.
Water alfo conveys nourishment, or a more fixed and folid matter to the
parts of vegetables, where having depofited it, the finer fluid perfpires
into the atmofphere, which gives us the phyfical caufe of the dampnefs and
unwholefomenefs of woody countries, as they remarkably find in America.
For all large vegetables aft after the manner of forcing-pumps, continu­
ally drawing in large quantities of water at their roots, and difeharging
it
O F A S T R O L O G Y . ' 65
it at their leaves ; which intimates a method of colleding water in dry
countries, and likewife of making fait water frefh. It is alfo obferva-
ble, that water in pafting through plants, after having depolited its more
terreftrial part, does not always go off pure, but impregnated with the
finer effluvia, or more fubtile particles o f the vegetable ; thus making an
atmofphere around every plant according to its nature, odoriferous or o-
therwife, which fupplics us with a rule for procuring the odoriferous
waters of vegetables by diftillation. But the particles, not fine enough
to go off thus along with the water, are left behind upon the furface of
the leaves and flowers of plants, being now thickened or itrained from
their moifter parts, and remaining in the form of honey, manna, gums,
or balfains, according to the nature of the vegetable. And hence we
deduce the phylical caufe why plants prove more odoriferous and fweet
when the air is both warm and moift, as is the cafe immediately after a
fummer fhowcr. Water is likewife of the utmoft ufe in divers of
the mechanical arts and occafions of life, as in the motion of mills,
engines, fountains, and all other machines which ad by the -f- laws of
Hydroftatics.
The fourth element, which is paiflve and fixed, is Earth, and conflits
of a limple, dry, and cold fubitance ; and is an ingredient in the compo-
fition of all natural bodies. It muft beobferved, that pure native earth*
is a very different matter from the earth whereon we tread, and this pure
earth is fuppofed to be the bafis, or fubftratem of all bodies, and that
wherein the other principles refide. It is all that is folid in an animal,
or vegetable body, all the real vafcular parts, the reft being juices. This
earth may be found in and feparated from all animal and vegetable fub-
fiances, and is the fame in all, and is the bafis of all. It remains after
the feparation of the other principles by chemiftry, from all animal and
vegetable fubftances, and neither coheres together, nor fuffers any change
in the fire. The affayers acknowledge no difference between the earth o f
animals and vegetables, but make their tefts for the niceft ufes equally o f
both. If water be poured upon this earth, it acquires fome degree of te­
nacity, fo as to become capable of being formed into veflels ; but if oil
be added, it coheres into a much Jtronger and more compad mafs -, hence
it appears that oil and earth are the principles which give confiftence and
tenacity to plants. This oil, as well as this earth, feems the fame in all,
and poffeffes nothing of the poifonous or medicinal virtues of the plant,
or whatever it is extraded from ; they being all feparable by decodion,
diftillation, and other procefles of that kind, and never remain* either in

the earth, or in this conne&ing oil. Long drying will divert plants of all
their virtues; fo that nothing but thefe principles lhall remain in them,
ami thefe giving folidity and figure, preferve the plant in its former ap­
pearance ; but thefe only remaining, it pofiefies none of its virtues.
Th is pure earth may be procured by drawing off the fpirit, fulphur,
phlegm, and falts of wine j and what remains will be a taftdefs, feent-
kfs, dufty matter, not capable of being railed by diftillation, or diffolv-
ed by lolution, but will preferve the fame ilate and form even in the fire ;
and this is called pure earth, or caput mortuum. It may alfo be obtained
pure and unmixed horn the common clafs of vegetables and other bodies,
by letting the remaining mafs, after diftillation, be thoroughly calcined,
then boiled in leveral waters to get out all its fait, and after this dried
in a clear fire, or in the fun ; and this dried mafs will be pure | earth.
Thus, from the different qualities and operations of the four elements
upon one another, we may ohferve, that the fire preferves the earth
from being overwhelmed or deftroyed by water ; the air preferves the fire
that it is not extinguiihed; and the water preferves the earth, that it is
not burnt; but if either of thefe adtive elements were to become predo­
minant in any great degree, the world would be deitroyed ; as was the
cafe at the time of the deluge, by the predominancy of water.
O f thefe four elements the' whole terreitrial world is compofcd, with
all its productions and appendages; and over thefe Man hath the do­
minion, as God’s vicegerent upon earth, being compounded of the moil
perfedt and noble part of earthly matter, and formed after God’s own
image and likenefs. Hence Man is called the Microcofm, from
little, and **<
7**-, 'world, literally fignifying, the little world, which is ap­
plied to Man by way of eminence, as being an epitome of all that is excel­
lent and wonderful in Nature.’ If we attentively confider the ftrudture
and faculties of man, we fhall clearly perceive his exiitence upon earth,
in a charadter fubordinate to that of angels, is only intended by the Deity
for a ftate of probation 3 and as this corporeal life ihall terminate, either
in adts of piety, or profanenefs, fo ihall follow the retributions of an im­
partial and juft Judge, in a future ftate of everlafting duration. Man is
compofcd of three diftindt effences, Spirit, Soul, and Body ; as St. Paul

and ftars, upon Man’s body, becaufe he hath a microcofmical fun, moon,
and ftars within himfclf, that bear a fympathy with the celeftial bodie „
and in the centre of which fhines the divine Spirit. For thefenfual, ce­
leftial part of man, is that whereby we move, lee, feel, tafte, and line!!,
and have a commerce with all material objeds; and through thefe the
influences of the divine Nature are conveyed to the more refined and
lenfible organs. This celeftial fpirit aduates and influences the elemen­
tary eflencc, and ftirs it up to the propagation of its like, and to every other
purpofe for which Nature defignedit. And this fpirit is even difcoverablc
in herbs and flowers, which open when the fun rifes, and clofe when he
fets; which motion is produced by the fpirit being fenfible of the approach
and departure of the fun’s influence. N ext to thefe, in Man, ihines that
pure, etherial, angelic part, called the rational foul; which is a divine
light or ftream flowing immediately from the Great Creator, uniting
Man with God, and railing him above all other parts of animated na­
ture. This Soul, when once it enters the body, runs parallel with
eternity ; and joins in with the celeftial fpirit, through the fphere of the
planets; and is conduded by a divine Genii, to an hypoftatical union
with the elementary body; fo that there exifts two adive principles in
the body of man, to one pafive; and as the Superior Rules in the celef­
tial world are fituated at the time o f man’s nativity, fo will his confti-
tution and difpofition be framed. And here we derive the caufe of all
thofe aftoniihing variations of temper, difpofition, and conftitution, which
are not only peculiar to different lubjeds, but even to one and the fame
perfon; for every one will bear teftimony of this fad, that we find our-
ielves fometimes chearful, and at other times melancholy; to day in perfed
health, and to-morrow in pain and anguifh ; this hour compofed, affa­
ble, and complacent, and the next auftere, petulcnt, and peremptory 5
and thefe contrarieties, are evidently produced by the continual rcfiftance
and oppofition of the four elements in man’s body, whiqh alternately dif-
pofe him to the various affedions difcoverablc in human nature. - The
caufe of this is deduced from the natural enmity of the elementary mat­
ter, viz. heat and cold, and drinefs and moifture ; each of which occa-
fionally predominates in man’s body, according to the motion and influ­
ence of thofe heavenly bodies, th$t rule, govern, and modify the operation
of the four elements, in and upon every terreftrial fubftance. Thus it is
evident, that the underllanding and intelledual faculties of Man are form­
ed of the ethereal w orld; the fenfitive powers of life and adion are derived
from the celeftial world ; and the grofs and corruptible part, the flefh and
blood, confifts of the elementary world ; which are all fubordinate the
one to the other. Under this idea of the workmanihip and conftrudion
of Man, Job exclaimed, that he was fearfully and wonderfully made;
in poffefling the three-fold effences, 01 fpirit, foul and body*
N Sceptical
68 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
Sceptical and atheiftical writers, indeed, have attempted to overturn this
fyftem of nature in the conftrudion of man, by denying the immortality
o f the foul, and a future diftribution o f rewards and punifhments ; con­
tending that the foul is an indivifible parr of the body, and has its diffo-
lution in the common courfe o f mortality. But thefe tenets are fo ex­
tremely abfurd, fo vague, and fo deftitute o f evidence, that the rational
mind is at a lofs to conceive how fuch an inconfiftent dodrine could have
ever been broached ; for, the fame philofophical reafoning that enables us
to define the nature and exiftence of the body, will like wife prove the
nature and exiftence of the foul. It is only from the primary or eflential
qualities of body, its cxtenfion, and folidity, that we form any idea of
i t ; and whv may we not form the complex idea of a foul or fpirit, from
the operations o f thinking, underftanding, willing, and the like, which
are experiments in ourlelvcs ? This idea of an immaterial fubftance, is as
clear as that we have of a material one ; for though the notion o f imma­
terial fubftances may be attended with difficulties, we have no more
reafon to deny or doubt of its truth, than we have to deny or doubt
o f the exiftence o f the body. That the foul is an immaterial fub­
ftance, appears from hence— that the primary operations of willing and
thinking, are not only unconneded with the known properties of body,
but feem plainly inconfiftent with fome of its moft eflential qualities.
For the mind not only difeovers no relation between thinking, and the
motion and arrangement of parts; but it likewife perceives, that conciouf-
nefs, a fimple ad, can never proceed from a compounded fubftance, ca­
pable of being divided into many parts. T o illuftrate this, let us only
fuppole a fyftem of matter endowed with thought; then, either all the
parts of which this fyftem confifts muft think, which would make it
not one, but a multitude of diftind confcious beings; or its power of
thinking muft arife from the connexion o f the parts one with another,
their motion, and diipofition, which, all taken together, contribute to the
produdion of thought. But it is evident, that the motion o f parts, and
the manner of combining them, can produce nothing but an artful ftruc-
ture, and various modes of motion. Hence all machines, however artful­
ly their parts are put together, and however complicated their ftruc-
ture, though we conceive innumerable different motions, varioufly com­
bined, and running one into another with an endlefs variety, yet ne­
ver produce any thing but figure and motion. I f a clock, or watch, tells
the hour and minutes of the day, it is only by the motion of the different
hands, pointing fucceffively at the different figures marked upon the
hour-plate for that purpofe. W e never imagine this to be the effed o f
thought or intelligence, nor conceive it poflible, by any confinement of
ftrudure, fo to improve the compofrtion, as that it ihall become capable
o f knowledge and confcioufnefs; and the reafon is plainly this, that
thought
O F A S T R O L O G Y . Cf
thought being fomething altogether different from motion and figure,
without the leafl connexion between them, it can never be fuppofed to
refult from them. This then being evident, that intelligence cannot
arife from an union, or combination of unintelligent parts; if we fuppofe
it to belong to any fyilem o f matter, we mufl necefiarily attribute it to
all the parts of which that iyflem is compofed; whereby, inflead o f one,
we fhall, as was before obferved, have a multitude of diilindt confcious
beings. And becaufe matter, how far foever we purfue the minutenefs
o f its parts, is itiil capable of repeated divilions, even to infinity, it is
plain that this abfurdity will follow us through all the iuppofitions that
make thought inherent in a material fubilance. Wherefore, as cunfci-
oufnefs is incompatible with the cohefion of folid feparable parts, we are
neceffarily led to place it in fome other fubilance of diilindl Nature and
Properties— and this fubilance we call Spirit, which is altogether diilindt
from body, nay, and commonly placed in oppofition to i t ; for which
reafon, the beings of this clafs are called immaterial; a word that im­
plies nothing of their true nature, but merely denotes its contrariety to
that of matter, or material fubilances*
As to the immortality of the human foul, the arguments to prove it
may be reduced to the following heads; firil, The nature of the foul it-
felf, its defires, fenfe of moral good and evil, and gradual increafe o f
knowledge and perfedtion; and fecondly, The moral attributes of God.
Under the former of thefe confiderations, it is apparent that the foul, be«*
ing an immaterial intelligent fubilance, as has been already proved, does
not depend upon the body for its exiitence; and therefore may, and ab*
folutely mufl exifl after the body, unlefs annihilated by the fame power
which gave it a being at firil, which is not to be fuppofed, fince there are
no inflances o f annihilation in nature. This argument, efpecially if the
infinite capacity of the foul, its flrong defire after immortality, its ra­
tional adlivity and advancement towards perfedlion, be likewife confidered,
will appear perfedtly conclufive to men o f a philofophical turn ; becauie
nature, or rather the God of nature, does nothing in vain. But argu­
ments drawn from the moral attributes o f the Deity, are not only better
adapted to convince men unacquainted with abflradl reafoning, but equally
certain and conclufive with the former 5 for as the juflice of God can
never fuffer the wicked to efcape unpunifhed, nor the good to remain
always unrewarded; therefore arguments drawn from the manifeft and
continual profperity o f the wicked, and the frequent misfortunes and un-
happinefs of good and virtuous men in this life, mull convince every
thinking perfon, that there is a future flate wherein all will be fet right,
and God's attributes of wifdom, goodnefs, and juflice, fully vindicated.
Had the religious and confcientious part of mankind no hopes of a future
ftate, they would be of all men the moll miferable $ but as this is abio-
“ lutely
7 Ô A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
lutely inconliilent with the moral character of the Deity, the certainty o f
fuch a Hate is clear to a demonilration.
Thus far we have confidered the elementary world, which is the lowelt
in dignity; and man, the chief fubjedt thereof. The celellial world*
which is next in eminence, is conilituted of a body natural, moll Ample,
fpherical, clear, fluid, and moving conilantly in a circle, and this by virtue
o f an innate power always within itfelf; comprehending and containing
the fun, moon, planets, and ilars, fixed in diftindt orbs by the great A r­
chitect of Nature, and bearing fympathy with all terreltrial fubftances, as
being formed out of the fame chaotic mafs, at the beginning of the world.
This ccleilial heaven is what Mofes calls the firmament, which was
the work of the fecond day’s creation, and literally lignifies an expanfe o f
extenfion; a term very well adapted by the prophet to the impreflion
which the heavens make on our fenfes; whence in other parts of the
Scriptures, the heaven is compared to a curtain, or a tent ftretched out to
dwell in. Through the medium of this ccleilial world, and the heavenly
bodies therein contained, the fupreme Being rules, governs, and actuates
the elementary world ; and this is apparent, becaufe that thing which we
term obedience, is only to be found in elementary bodies. And fince mo­
tion is the caufe of all mutation and change, and as all motion originates
with the heavenly bodies, by the revolutions of which even Time itfelf
is meafured out and divided, fo we find thefe celellial influences produce
all the variations of heat and cold, drynefs and moiiture, generation and
corruption, increafe and decreafe, life and death, and all the viciffitudes
o f nature, without even varying themfelves, or being fubjedt to the leall
change or alteration ; whilil the elementary bodies are perpetually chang­
ing, and never continue in one flay. Hence it is apparent that the celei-
tinl bodies are active, and the elementary paffive; lo that the ccleilial bo­
dies give the form and ilamp to all the productions of nature, and the ele­
mentary bodies fubminiftcr matter to receive this form. And as the pollu­
tions and affections of the heavenly afpedts are when this form or ilamp
is given j and as the quality of the elementary matter ihall be when fubmi-
niilered, fo will the nature and quality of the fubjedt be, that receives this
celellial form or Ilamp. And were it not for this active and paflive prin­
ciple, then would all elementary things be alike, without a poflibility of
exiiling. It is, therefore, a perfedl knowledge of this mediate or celef-
tial world, its various affections and difpolitions, the nature, tendency*
and effect of the luminaries, their motions, afpedts, and pofitions, which
enable us to judge of future contingencies, and to difeover the fecret and
abitrufe operations of nature: But to attain this knowledge in any com­
petent degree, we mull trace thefe heavenly intelligencers throughout the
whole celellial regions, and acquaint ourfelves with their general and
efiential
OF A S T R O L O G Y . 71
eflential qualities. I ihall for this purpofe, after treating of the ethereal
world, make this fpeculation a leading clue to the art of calculating
nativities.
The Etherial world, which is the fuperior, and the higheit in dignityv
is that which the infpired writers, and the ancient philofophers, called the
Empyrean Heaven, and is conceived to be the abode of God, and bleffed
fpirits, of angels, and the fouls of the righteous departed ; .wherein the
Deity is pleafed to afford a nearer and more immediate view of himfelf,
a more fenfible manifeflation of his glory, and a more adequate per­
ception of his attributes, than in the other parts of the univerfe, where he
is likewife prefent. But the moft exalted conceptions we can poffibly
form of this blifsful abode, are extremely inadequate and imperfedl ; nor
is. it in the power of the moft enlarged underftanding to frame fuitable
ideas of the Godhead, or of the angelic hoft that perpetually furround his
throne. As much, however, as the human compreheniion is able to con '
tain, the Almighty has been gracioufly pleafed to reveal to us in the Scrip­
tures, by the infpired writers, particularly Ifaiah, Ezekiel, and St. John
the Divine, who have given us very magnificent deferiptions of the hea­
venly maniions, their ftrudture, apparatus, and angelic attendance* FronT
this divine Revelation the Hebrew writers, and other learned men, have
deferibed the Harmony of the Univerfe, and the neceffary fubordination
and dependence of one thing upon another, from the interior heaven, to
the remoteft corner of the earth. W e ihall therefore prefume to follow
thefe authors in fpeaking of God and his angels ; and whoever fufhciently
contemplates the fubjedt, will be fecure againft the impious dodtrines o f
Atheifts, of Free-thinkers, of immoral and irreligious men.
God is an immaterial, intelligent,and free Being; of perfedt gofcdnefs,
wifdom, and pow er; who made the univerfe, and continues to fupport
it, as well as to govern and diredt it by his providence. By his imma-
teriallity, intelligence, and freedom, God is diftinguifhed from fate, na­
ture, deftiny, neceffity, chance, and from all other imaginary beings.
In feripture, God is defined by, I am that I am; Alpha and Om ega;
the beginning and end of all things. Among philofophers, he is de­
fined a Being of infinite perfedtion ; or in whom there is no defedt
of any thing which we conceive might raife, improve, or exalt his na­
ture. Among men, he is chiefly confidered as the firft caufe, the firft
Being, who has exifted from the beginning, has created the world, or
who fubfifts neceflarily, or of him ielf; and this knowledge o f God, his
nature, attributes, word, and works, with the relations between him
and his creatures, make the extenfive fubjedt of Theology, the filler
feience o f Aftrology.
O Sir
72 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
Sir Ifaac Newton confiders and defines God, not as is ufually done,
from his perfection, his nature, efciftence, or the lik e ; but from his
dominion. The word God, according tp him, is a relative term, and
has a regard to fervants ; it is true it denotes a Being eternal, infinite, and
ablolutely perfect 5 but a Being, however eternal, infinite, and abfolute-
ly perfect, without dominion, would n6t be God. The fame author
ohlerves, that the word God, frequently fignifies Lord; but every lord is
not God ; it is the dominion of a fpiritual being or lord, that conftitutes
G od; tine dominion, true G od; fupreme, the fupreme ; feigned, the
falfe god. From fuch true dominion it follows, that the true God is
living, intelligent, and powerful ; and from his other perfections, that
he is iupreme, or fupremely perfect: he is eternal, and infinite ; om­
nipotent, and omnilcient; that is, he endures from eternity to eternity,
and is prefent from infinity to infinity. He governs all things that exift,
and knows all things that are to be known ; he is not eternity, nor infi­
nity, but eternal, and infinite; he is not duration or fpacc, but he en­
dures, and is prefent; he endures always, and is prefent everywhere;
and by exifting always, and every where, he conftitutes the very thing,
duration and fpace, eternity and infinity. He is omniprefent, not only
virtually, but alfo fubftantially; for power without fubftance cannot fub-
fift. All things are contained, and move in him, but without any mutual
paflion; he fuffers nothing from the motions of bodies ; nor do they un­
dergo any refiftance from his omniprefence. It is confeifed that God ex-
ifts neceflarily; and by the fame neceflity he exifts always, and every
where. Hence, alfo, he rtfuft be perfedly fimilar; all eye, all car, all
brain, all arm, all the power of perceiving, underftanding, and adting ; but
after a manner not at all corporeal, after a manner not like that of men,
after a manner wholly to us unknown. ‘H e is deftitute of all body, and
all bodily ihape; and therefore cannot be feen, heard, or touched ; nor
ought to be worihipped under the reprefentation of any thing corporeal.
W e have ideas of tne attributes o f God, but do not know the fubftance
even of any thing; we fee only the figures and colours of bodies, hear only
founds, touch only the outward furfaces, fmell only odours, and tafte
taftes; but do not, cannot, by any fenfe, or any reflex adt, know their
inward fubftances; and much lefs can we have ,any notion of the fub­
ftance o f God. W e know him by his properties, and attributes; by the
moil wife and excellent ftructure of things, and by final caufes; but we
adore and worihip him only on account of his dominion; for God, fet-
ting afide dominion, providence, and final caufes, is nothing elfe but fate
and * nature. , .

The admirable metaphyfician and divine, Dr. Clarke, has demonftrafced
the being o f a God, with thatclearneis and force o f reafoning, for which

he
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 73
he is fo eminently diftinguilhed, by a feries of propoiitions, mutually con-
ncfted and dependent, and forming a complete and unanfwcrable argu­
ment in proof o f the attributes o f the Deity. Something, he fays, has
exifted from all eteftiity; for, fince famething now is, fomething always
w as: othetwife the* things that now are, mull have been produced out of
nothiiig, abfohitely and without caufe, which is a plain contradiction in
terms. There mull have exifted from all eternity fome one unchangeable
and independent B eing; or elfe, there has been an infinite fucceffion of
changeable and dependent beings, produced one from another in anendlefs
progreflion, without any original caufe at all. For without, this feries of
beings can have no caufe of its exiftence, becaufe it includes all things that
are or ever were in the univerfe; nor is any one being in this infinite fuc-
0611100 felf-exiftent or neceflary, and therefore it can have no reafon of its
exiftence within itfelf; and it was equally poflible, that from eternity
there Ihould never have exifted any thing at all, as that a fucceffion of fuch
beings ihould have exifted from eternity. Confequently their exiftence
is determined by nothing; neither by any neceffity in their own nature,
becaufe none of them are felf-exiftent; nor by any other being, becaufe
no other is fuppofed to exill.— That unchangeable and independent Being,
which has exifted from eternity, without any external caufe of its exif­
tence, muft be felf-exiftent; it mull exift by an abfolute neceffity origi­
nally in the nature of the thing itfelf, and antecedent in the natural order
o f our ideas to our fuppofition of its being. For whatever exifts, muft
cither come into being without a caufe ; or it muft have been produced
by fome external caufe; or it muft be felf-exiftent: but the two former
iuppofitions are contrary to the two firft propoiitions. From this laft
propolition it follows, that the only true idea of a felf-exiftent or necef-
iarily exifting being, is the idea of a being, the fuppofition of whofc non-
cxiftence is an exprefs cotHfodidion $ and this idea is that of a moll fimple
being, abfolutely eternal and infinite, original and independent. It fol­
lows alfo, that nothing is fo certain as the exiftence o f a fupreme inde­
pendent caufe; and likewife, that the material world cannot poffibly be
the firft and original being, uncreated, independent, and of itfelf eternal;
becaufe it does not exift by an abfolute neceffity in its own nature, fo as
that it muft bean exprefs contradidlion to fuppofe it not to exift. W ith
reipedt both to its form and matter, the material world may be conceived
not to be, or to be in any refpedl different from what it is, without a con­
tradiction. The fubftance or effence of the felf-exiftent being is ablo-
lutely incomprehenfible by us ; neverthelefs, many of the effential attri-
bute$ of his nature are ftridtly demonftrable, as well as his exiftence.—
•The felf-exiftent being, having no caufe of its exiftence but the abfolute
neceflity of its own nature, muft of neceffity have exifted from everlaft-
ing, without beginning; and muft of neceffity exift to everlafting, without
end.— The felf-exiftent being mull of neceffity be infinite and omnipre-
k n t .
74 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
fent. Such a being muft be every whdre, as well as always unalterably
the fam¿. It follows from hence, that the felf-exiftent being muft be a
moft limpie, unchangeable, incorruptible being* without parts, figure,
motion, divifibility, and other properties of matter, which are utterly in-
confiftent with complete infinity. The felf-exiiteintt being mull of necef-
fity be but one; becaufe in abiblute neceflity there can be no difference
or diveriity of exiftence; and/ ¿herefore, it is abfolutely impoffible, that
there ihould be two independent felf-exiftent principles, fuch as God and
matter.— The felf-exiftent and original caufe o f all things muft be an in­
telligent being. This propofition cannot be demonftntted ftridtly and
properly a p rio ri; but a pojleriori, the world affords undeniable argu­
ments to prove that all things are the effedts o f an intelligent and know­
ing caufe. The caufe muft be always more excellent than the effedt; and,
therefore, from the various kinds of powers and degrees o f excellence and
perfection, which vilible objedts poffefs; from the intelligence of created
beings, which is a real diftindt quality or perfedtion, and not a mere ef­
fect or compofition of unintelligent figure and motion ; from the variety,
order, beauty, wonderful contrivance, and fitnefs of all things to their pro­
per and refpedtive ends; and from the original of motion, the felf-exiftent
creating being is demonftrated to be intelligent. The felf-exiftent and
original caufe of all things is not a* neceffary agent, but a being endued
with liberty and choice. Liberty is a neceifary confequent of intelli­
gence; without liberty, no being can be faid to bean agent, or caufe of
any thing ; fince to adt neceflarily, is really and properly not to adt at all*
but to be adted upon. Befides, if the fupreme caufe be not endued with
liberty, it will follow, that nothing which is not, could poffibly have
been ; that nothing which is, could poffibly not have been; and that no
mode or circumftance of the exiftence of any thing, could poffibly have
been in any refpedl otherwife than what it nef# adiually is. Farther, if
there be any final caufe in the univerfe, the fupreme caufe is a free agent;
and on the contrary fuppofition, it is impoffible that any effedt ihould be
finite; and in every effedt, there muft have been a progreffion of caufes in
infinitum, without any original caufe at all.— The felf-exiftent being, the
fupreme caufe of all things, muft of neceflity have infinite power; fince all
things were made by him, and are entirely dependent upon him ; and all
the powers of all things are derived from him, and perfedtly fobjedfc to
him ; nothing can refift the execution of his w ill.— The fupreme caufe
and author of all things muft o f neceflity be infinitely wife. This fol­
lows from the propofitions already eftabliihed ; and the proof a pofieriori,
of the infinite wifdom of God, from the coniideration o f the exquilite
perfedtion and confummate excellency of his works, is no lefs ftrong and
undeniable.— The fupreme caufe and author of all things muft of neceflity
be a being of infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and all other moral
perfedtions; fuch as become the fupreme governor and judge of the
world.
O F A S T R O L O G Y , 75
world. The will of a being, infinitely knowing and wife, independent and
all-powerful, can never be influenced by any wrong affeftion, and can ne­
ver be miilead or oppofed from without; and, therefore, he muft do
always what we know fitted: to bo done; that is, he muft aft always ac­
cording to the ftrifteft rules o f infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and
all other moral perfections; and, more particularly, being infinitely and ne-
ceflarily happy and all-fufficient, he muft be unalterably difpofed to do
and to communicate good or *happinefs.
T o this more abilrufe argument a priori, for the exiftence of God, we
may add another, more generally obvious, and carrying irrefiftible con-
viftion, which is deduced from the frame o f the world, and from the
traces of evident contrivance and fitnefs of things for one another, that;
occur through all the parts of it. Thefe confpire to prove, that the ma­
terial world, which in its nature is originated and dependent, could not
have been the effeft of chance or neceffity, but of intelligence and defign.
The beautiful, harmonious, and beneficial arrangement of the various bo­
dies that compofe the material fyftem j their mutual dependence and fub-
ferviency; the regularity of their motions, and the aptitude of thefe mo­
tions for producing the moft beneficial effefts; and many other pheno­
mena refulting from their relation, magnitude, lituation, and ufe, afford
unqueftionable evidences of the creating power and wife difpofal of an in­
telligent and almighty agent. The power of gravity, by which the ce-
leftial bodies perfevere in their revolutions, deferves our particular confi-
deration. This power penetrates to the centre« of the fun and planets,
without any dimunition of it9 virtue, and is extended to immenfe dis­
tances, regularly decreafing, and jSfodiiting the moft fenfible and impor­
tant cffefts. Its aftion is proportibnal to the quantity of folid matter in
bodies, and not to their furfaces, as is ufual in mechanical caufes; and,
therefore, feems to furpaf9 mere mechanifm. But however various the
phenomena that depend on this power, and may be explained by it, no
mechanical principles can account for its effefts ; much lefs could it have
produced, at the beginning, the regular fituation of the orbs, and thepre-
fent difpofition of things. Gravity could not have determined the planets
to move from weft to eaft, in orbits nearly circular, almoft in the fame
plane; nor could their power have projefted the comets, with all the va­
riety of their direftions. If we fuppofe the matter of the fyftem to be
accumulated in the centre by its gravity, no mechanical principles, with
the afliftance‘of this power, could* feparate the huge and unweildy mafs
into fuch parts as the fun and plimets; and, after carrying them to their
different diftances, prbjeft them in thdr feveral direftions, preferving ftill
the equality of aftion ahd1re-attioni or the ftate of the centre of gravity of

the fyftem. Such an exquifite ftrudture of things could only arife from
the contrivance and powerful influences of an intelligent, free, and molt
potent agent. The lame powers, therefore, which at prefent govern the
material world, and conduct its various motions, are very different from
thole, which were necefiary to have produced it from nothing, or to have
difpoled it in the admirable form in which it now proceeds.
But we fhould exceed the limits of our plan, if, confining our obferva-
tion to the earth, our own habitation, we were to enumerate only the
principal traces of defign and wifdom, as well as goodnefs, which are dif-
cernible in its figure and conftituent parts, in its diurnal and annual mo­
tion, in the polition of its axis with regard to its orbit, in the benefit
which it derives from the light and heat of the fun, and the alternate vi-
cillitudcs of the fealons; in the atmolphere which furrounds it, and in
the different fpecies and varieties of vegetables and animals with which
it is replenifhed. No one can furvey the vegetable produdions of the
earth, fo various, beautiful, and ufcful, nor the various gradations o f
animal life, in fuch a variety of fpecies, all preferved diftindt, and propa­
gated by a fettled law, each fitted to its own element, provided with pro­
per food, and with inftindts and organs, fuited to its rank and lituation,
and eipecially with the powers of fenfation and lelf-motion, and all more
immediately or remotely fubfervient to the government and ufe of man,
without admiring the ikill and deiign of the original Former. But thefe
are more fignally manifefted in the ftrlidture o f the human frame, and in
the noble powers and capacities of the human m ind; more efpecially in
the moral principles and faculties, which are a diftinguiihing part of our
conftitution, and lead to the perception and acknowledgment of the ex­
igence and government o f God. In thofe inftances that have now been
recited, and a variety of fimilar inftances fuggeited by them, or naturally
occurring to the notice of the curious and refle&ing mind, contrivance is
manifeil, and immediately, without any nice or fubtle reafoning, fuggeils
a contriver. It ftrikes us like a fenfation ; and artful reafonings againft
it may puzzle us, without lliaking our belief. No perfon, for example,
that knows the principles of optics, and the ftrudture o f the eye, can
believe that it was formed without ikill in that fcience; or that the ear
was formed without the knowledge of founds; or that the male and fe­
male, created and preferved in due proportion, were not formed for each
other, and for continuing the fpecies. A ll our accounts of nature are full
o f inftances of this kind. The admirable and beautiful ftrudture of
things for final caufes, exalt our idea of the contriver; and the unity o f
deiign fhews him to be one. The great motions in the iyftem, performed
with the fame facility as the leaft, fuggeft his almighty power, which,
gave motion to the earth and the celeftial bodies, with equal eafe as to
ihe minuteft particles; the fubtility of the motions and adtions in the
O F A S T R O L O G Y , 77
internal parts o f bodies, fhews that his influence penetrates the inmofl
recedes of things, and that he is equally aCtive and prefent every where.
The fimplicity of the laws that prevail in the world, the excellent difpo-
lition of things, in order to obtain the beft ends, and the beauty which
adorns the works of nature, far fuperior to any thing in art, fuggeit his
confummate wifdom. The ufefulnefs of the whole fcheme, fo well con­
trived £
0
1* the intelligent beings who enjoy it, with the internal difpofition
and moral ftruCture of thole beings, fhews his unbounded goodnefs.
Thefe are arguments which are fufliciently open to the views and capa­
cities of the unlearned, while at the fame time they acquire new ftrength
and luflre from the difeoveries of the learned. The Deity’s adtingand in-
terpofing in the univerle, ihew that he governs it, as well as that he formed
it; and the depth of his counfels, even in conducing the material univerfe,
of which a great part furpafles our knowledge, tends to preferve an inward
veneration and awe o f this great Being, and difpofes us to receive what
may be otherwife revealed to us concerning him. HiseiTence, as well as
that of all other fubltances, is beyond the reach of all our difeoveries ;
but his attributes clearly appear in' his admirable works. W e know that
the higheft conceptions we are able to form of them, are (till beneath his
real perfections; but his dominion over us, and our duty towards him,
are abundantly * manifeil.
Another fubftantial argument to prove the exiftence of God, as the
creator and governor of the univerfe, may be deduced from the univerfal
eonfent of mankind, and the uniform tradition of this belief through
every nation and every age; it is impoffible to conceive, that a fallacy,
fo perpetual and udtvcrfal, fhould be impofed on the united reafon of man­
kind. No credible and fatisfaCtory account can be given o f this univerfal
eonfent, without aferibing it to the original conftitution of the human
mind, in confequence of which it cannot fail to difeern the exiftence of a
Deity, and to the undeniable traces b f his being, which his works afford.
Fear, ftate-policy, and the prejudices of education, to which the concur­
rence of mankind in this principle has been fometimes refolved, are founded
on this univerfal principle, fuppofe its being and influence, and are actuated
by it. It is much more reasonable to imagine, that the belief of a God
was antecedent to their operation, than that it fhould have been produced
by them; and that it was dictated by reafon and confcience, independent
of the paflion and .policy of men. The uniform and univerfal tradition
of this belief, and of the creation of the world by the divine power, af­
fords concurring evidence both of the principle and of the faCt. The
exiftence of God is alfo farther evinced by thofe arguments which have been
ufually aliedged to prove, that the world had a beginning, and, therefore,
* See Maclaurin’s Account of Sir Ifaac Newton's Phi). Difc. b. iv. chap. g. Baxter in his
Matho, Derham, Ray, Nieuwentyt, De laPluchc in his Nature difplayed, Chamb. Cyclop. & c.
78 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
that it muft have been created by the energy of divine power. In proof
of this, the hiitory of Mofes, coniidered merely as the moil ancient hifto-
rian, deferves particular regard. His teilimony is confirmed by the moil
ancient writers, among the heathens, both poets and hiilorians. It may
be alfo fairly alledged, that we have no hiftory or tradition more ancient
than that which agrees with the received opinion of the world's begin­
ning, and of the manner in which it was produced; and that the moil
ancient hiitories were written long after that time. And this confidera-
tioii is urged by Lucretius, the famous Epicurean, as a ftrong prefumption
that the world had a beginning:
------ Si nulla fuit genitalis origo
Terrarum & cceli, femperque seterna fuere :
Curfupra bellum Thebanum, & funera Trojse,
Non alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae ?
Befides the origin and progrefs of learning, and the moil ufeful arts,
confirm the notion of the world's beginning, and of the common sera o f
its creation; to which alfo may be added, that the world itfelf, being
material and corruptible, muil have had a beginning ; and many pheno­
mena occur to the obfervation o f the aftronomer and mathematician,
which furniih a ftrong prefumption, that it could have had no long du­
ration, and that it now gradually tends to diffolution. From thefe con-
iiderations we may infer the abfolute being and providence of G od ;
which alfo demonllrate the exiftence of his angels and miniftring fpirits,
who are the meffengers of his will, and the proper inhabitants of the
ethereal world, and confequently the next fubjedts of our enquiry.
An Angel is a fpiritual, intelligent fubftancc, and the firft in rank and
dignity of all created beings ; though the word A ngel, is not pro­
perly a denomination of nature, but of office; denoting a mejfengery or
executioner of the will of fome fuperior power or authority. In thisfenfe
they are frequently mentioned in Scripture, as miniftring fpirits fent by
the Almighty to declare his will, and to corredt, teach, reprove, and com­
fort. God alfo promulgated the law to Mofes, and appeared to the old
patriarchs by the mediation of angels, who reprefented him, and fpoke
in his name. The exiftence of angels is admitted in all religions ; the
Greeks and Latins acknowledged them under the names of genii and
demons; and in the Alcoran we find frequent mention of them; the
profeifors of the Mahometan religion affigned them various orders and
degrees, as well as different employments, both in heaven, and on earth.
The Sadducees alfo admit their exiftence; witnefs Abufaid, the author of
an Arabic verfion of the Pentateuch; and Aaron, a Caraite Jew, in his
comment on the Pentateuch ; both extant in manufeript in the king of
France's library. The heathen philofophers and poets were alfo agreed as
to the exiftence of intelligent beings, fuperior to man; as is ihewn by
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 79
St. Cyprian, in his treatife on the vanity of idols, from the teftimonies
of Plato, Socrates, and Trifmegiihis. Authors are not fo mnnimous
about their nature as of their exiftence; Clemens Alexandrinus believed
they had bodies, which was.alfo the opinion of Origen*, Caefarius, Ter-
tullian, and feveral others; but Athanafius, Bafil, Gregory, Nicene,.
Cyril, and Chryfoftom, hold them to be mere fpirits. Authors
are alfo divided as to the time of the creation of angels ; fome will have
it to have been before the creation of our world, or even from eternity;
while others maintain that they were created at the fame time with our
world. The moft probable conjedture is, that they were created at 'dif­
ferent periods, whenever it pleafed the Almighty to call them into ex­
iftence. But, though we cannot fo clearly demonftrate the* precife nature
and duration of angels, we may neverthelefs conclude, fhat, though they
are of an order highly fuperior to that of men, yet are they not complete
and perfedl; for, had they been created thus originally, they could not
have fallen, as Adam did, nor have finned, which the feriptures inform
us fome of them did by rebelling againft the Alm ighty, and in contend­
ing with him for fupreme authority. For this rcafon, as they are them-
felves imperfedt beings, they can in no one refpedt be confidered- proper
objedts of human adoration, which we are bound to pay alone to that
O ne Su p r e m e , who is omnipotent, immortal, infinite, the fource.
and centre of every thing that is great, and good, and perfedt.
Theologifts have divided angels into different ranks or fubordinations,
which they term Hierarchies, from *
ip
o
<
» holy, and rule, fignifying,
holy command, or to rule in holy things. Dionyfius, and other ancient
writers, have eftablifhed nine choirs or orders of thefe ccleftial fpirits,
namely, feraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers,
virtues, angels^and archangels; and thefe they form into three Hierarchies,
appointing them their refpcctive offices in the performance of adoration
and praife, and in executing the word and will of Ged. The Rabbins
and Jewifh writers, who had obvioufly a more immediate knowledge of
the angelic hoft, by the inlpiration of their prophets, and the revelation
of God’s true religion, have defined one rank of angels, or intelligent
beings, fuperior to all the foregging, which anfwer to or are contained in
the ten diftinguifhing names of God, and are the pure ellences of his
fpirit, or ftream though which his will and plealure is communicated
to the angels and blcfled lpirits, and through which his providence extern s
to the care and protection of all his works. The firft of iIk Ic divine of­
fences is denominated HVP, Jehovah, and is peculiarly attributed to G jd
the Father, being the pure and fimple elTence ot the Divinity, flowi ig
though Hajoth Hakados, to the angel Metraiton, and to the minifteiing
fpirit Re chith Hagalalim, who guides the primum mobile, and bellows
the gift of being upon all things. T o this fpirit is .allotted the office of
No. 4. Q bring-
8o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
bringing the fouls of the faithful departed into heaven ; and by him God
ipake to Mofes. The fecond is FT J a b , and is attributed the Perfoa
of the Mefliah, or whofe power and influence defeends though the
angel Mafleh into the lphere of the Zodiac. This is the fpirit or word
which actuated the chaos, and divided the unwrought matter into three
portions; of thefirft, or moil eiTential part, was the fpiritual world com-
pofed ; of the fecond, was made the viiible heavens and the luminous
bodies j and of the third, or inferior part, was formed the terreftrial
\*orld, oat of which was drawn the elemental quinteflence, orfirll matter
-of all things, which produced the four elements, and all creaturcs*that
inhabit them, by the agency of a particular fpirit called Raziel, who was
the ruler of Adam. The third is JTriK, E bjeh, and is attributed to the
Holy Spirit, whofe divine light is received by the angel Sabbathi, and
communicated from him though the fpherc o f Saturn. This is the prm -
ciphim gencrationu, the beginning of the ways of God, or the manifeila-
tion of the Father and the Son's light in the fupernatural generation.
And from hence flow dou n all living fouls, entering the inanimate body,
and giving form to unfettled matter. The fourth is E /, through the
light of whom flows grace, goodnefs, mercy, piety, and munificence,
to the angel Zadkiel ; and, thcncc paffing through the fphere of Jupiter,
iarihioneth the images of all bodies, bellowing clemency, benevolence,
and jnflicc, on all. The fifth is Elobi, the upholder of the fword
and left-hand of God, whofe influence penetrates the angel Geburah, and
thence defeends though the fphere of Mars, giving fortitude in war and
affliction. 1 he fixth is rOK3 ¥, Tfebaothy who beftoweth his mighty
power through the angel Raphael into the fphere of the Sun, giving mo­
tion, heat, and brightnefs, to it, and thence producing metals. T hefe-
venth is Elion, who rules the angel Michael, and defeends though
the fphere o f Mercury, giving benignity, motion, and intelligence, with
elegance and consonance of fpecch. The eighth is ^TTR, Adonaiy whofe
influence is received by the angel Haniel, and communicated through the
here of Venus, giving zeal, fervency, and righteoufnefs of heart, and
producing vegetables. The ninth is V
P
t£\ Sbaddai, whofe influence is con­
veyed by cherubim to the angel Gabriel, and falls into the fphere of the
Moon, caufing increase and decreafe of all things, governing the genii and
protectors of men. The tenth is Elohim, who extends his bene­
ficence to the angel Jefodoth, into the fphere of the earth, and difpenfeth
knowledge, underftanding, and wifdom. The three firft of thefe ten
nan cs, viz. mn\ Jehovah, FT, Jah, and iTliN, Ehjeh, exprefs the
eiTence of God^ and arc proper names ; but the other feven are only ex-
preflive of his attributes. The principal and only true name of the God­
head, according both to the Hebrews and Greeks, is riTtfT)HM"TRID,
'iBTC

9 the name o ffo u r lettersy with which the Godhead, in moil
languages, is obierved to be expreffed ; thus in Hebrew the Supreme

In the exterior circle of the celeftial heaven, in which are placed
the fixed ftarg, the Anim a M undi hath her particular forms, or feminal
conceptions, anfwering to the ideas of the Divine M in d ; and this fitu-
ation approaching neareft to the empyrean heaven, the feat of God, re­
ceives the fpiritual powers and influences which immediately proceed
from him. Hence they are diffufed through the fpheres of the planets
antrheavenly bodies, and communicated to the inmoft centre of the earth,
by means of the terreflrial elements. Thus have the wife and learned
,men A o n g the Jews deduced the conftru&ion and harmony of the world
and ihewn that God performs all his fecret^nd ftupendous works by the
medium of the celeftial bodies. He a£ts and governs immediately by
himfelf, but mediately by the heavenly bodies, which are the inftruments
o f his Providence, and the fecondary caufes, by which the earth and all
ftmilar fyftcms are regulated ; and thefe, perhaps, regulate one another,
by a reciprocal influence and fympathy, communicated to them in the
ordination of nature. And hence comes the original or ground-work
of all men’s nativities, and all manner o f natural queftions and things,
and the ftory of all that may happen or proceed out of natural caufes, to
the full end of time. T o demonftrata» this more fatisfadtorily, we fhall
now define the natural properties o f the celeftial world, with its particu­
lar divifions, quantity, motion, and meafure, as laid down by the rules
o f Aftronomy; and this w ill lead us to the dodrine o f nativities?

with the Places, Order, and Motions, of tKe H e a v e n l y Bodies,
*
IT was formerly a fubjeft of difpute among Philofophers, whether the
earth, or the Sun was the centre of theceleftial fyftem ; but the latter
opinion has been generally received lince the time of Copernicus, who about
the year 1543 publiihed his fix books De Orbium Caeleftium Revolu-
tionibus, wherein he proves the Sun to be very near the centre of gravity of
the whole fyftem, and in the common focus of every one of the planetary
orbits. Next the Sun, Mercury performs his revolution around him ;
next to Mercury is the orbit of Venus; and next to Venus, our earth,
with its attendant or fecondary the Moon, perform a joint courfe, and by
their revolution meafure out the annual period. Next to the earth is
Mars, the firft of the fuperior planets: next to him is Jupiter j and, laft
of all, Saturn. Thefe and the comets are the conftituent parts of the
Copernican or folar fyftem, which is now received and approved as the
only true one, becaufe mod agreeable to the tenor of nature in all her ac­
tions ; for, by the two motions of the earth all the phenomena of the
heavens are refolved, which by other hypothefes are inexplicable, without
a great number of other motions contrary to philofophical reafoning. It
is alfo more rational to fuppofe that the earth moves round the Sun, than
that the huge bodies of the planets, the ftupendous body of the Sun, and
the immenfe firmament of ftars, ftiould all move round the earth every
twenty-four hours. The harmony which runs through the folar fyftem
wonderfully confirms this hypothefis, viz. that the motions of all the
planets, both primary and fecondary, are governed and regulated by one
and the fame law, which is, that the fquares of the periodical times of
the primary planets are to each other as the cubes of their diftances from
the Sun^ and likewife the fquares of the periodical times of theieconda-
ries of any primary are to each other as the cubes of their diftances from
that primary. Now the Moon, which, in the Copernican fyftem, is a fe­
condary of the earth, in the other hypothefis is considered as a primary
one; and fo the rule cannot take place, becaufe the periodical time ftated
as that of a primary one does not agree therewith. But this Angle conli-
deration is fufficicnt to eftablifh the motion of the earth for ever; viz. if
the earth does not move round the Sun, the Sun muft move with the
Moon round the earth. Now the diftancc of the Sun to that of the
Moon being as io,oooto 46, andthe Moon’s period being lefs than twen­
ty-eight days, the Sun’s period would be found no lefs than two hundred
and forty-two years ; whereas, in fadl, it is but one year. The Sun alfo
being the fountain of light and heat, which it irradiates through all the
1 fyftem
O F A S T R O L O G Y . S3
fyftem, it muft of courfe be placed in the centre, in order that the planets
fl)ay at all times have it in an uniform and equable manner. For, if the
earth be fuppofed in the centre, and the Sun and planefs revolve about it,
the planets would then, like the comets, be fcorched with heat when
neareil the Sun, and frozen w ith r H in theiraphelia, or greateft diftance;
which is not to be imagined. .But, if the Sun be fuppofed in the centre
o f the fyftem, we then have the rational hypothefis*of the planets being all
moved round the Sun, by the univerfal law or power o f gravity ariiing
from his vail body, and every thing will anfwer to the laws of circular
motion and central forces ; but otherwife we are wholly in the dark, and
know not how to define thefe operations of nature. Fortunately, however,
we are able to give not only reafons, but dempnftrable proofs, that the Sun
does poffefs the centre of the fyftem, and that the planets move about
him in the order above-mentioned. The firft is, that Mercury and Ve­
nus are ever obferved to have two conjundlions with the Sun, but no op-
pofition, which could not happen unlefs the orbits of thefe planets lay
within the orbit of the earth. The fecond is, that Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn, have each their conjundlions and oppofitions to the Sun alternately
and fucceflively, which could not be, unlefs their orbits were exterior to
that of the earth. In the third place, the greateft elongation or diftance
of Mercury from the Sun is about twenty degrees, and that of Venus
forty-feven degrees; which anfwers exadlly to their diftance in this fyf­
tem ; but, in the other, they would be feen one«hundred and eighty de­
grees from the Sun, in oppofition to him. Fourthly, in this difpofition
o f the planets, they will all of them be fornetimes mu£h nearer to the earth
than at others ; the confequence of which is, that their brightnefs and
fplendor, and alfo their apparent diameters, will be proportionally great­
er at one time than another; and this we obferve to be true every day.
Thus, the apparent diameter of Venus, when greateft, is near fixty-fix
feconds, but, when lead, not more than nine and a half ; of Mars, when
greateft, it is twenty-one leconds, but, when lead, no more than two fe­
conds and a h alf; whereas, by the other hypothefis, they ought always
to be equal. The fifth is, that, when the planets are viewed with a good
telefcope, they appeal with different phafes, or with different parts of
their bodies enlightened. Thus Venus is fornetimes new, then horned,
and afterwards dichotomized, then gibbous, afterwards full, and fo cn-
creafes and decreafes her light in the fame manner as the Moon, and as
this fyftem requires. The fixth proof is, that the planets, all of them,
do fornetimes appear diredt in motion, fornetimes retrograde, and at other
times ftationary. Thus Venus, as fhe paffes from her greateft elongation
weftward to her greateft elongation eaftward, will appear diredt in mo­
tion, but retrograde as fhe paffes from the latter to the former; and,
when (he is in thofe points of greateft diftance from the Sun, fhe feems
No. 4. . R • f a
* *
84 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N
for fome time ftationary ; all which is neceflary upon the Copernicnn hy-
pothefis, but cannot happen in any other. The feventh is, that the bo­
dies of Mercury and Venus, in their lower conjundions with the Sun,
are hid behind the Sun’s body, and in the upper conjundions are feen to
pafs over the Sun’s body, or diik, in form of a black round fpot, which is
neceflary in the Copernican fyftcm, but impoflible in any other. The
eighth is, that the times in which thefe conjundions, oppofitions, fta-
tions, and rétrogradations, of the planets happen, are not fuch as they
would be if the earth were at reft in its orbit, but precifely fuch as
would happen were the earth to move round the Sun, and all the other
planets in the periods afligned them ; and therefore this, and no other,
can be the true fyftem of the world.
But, the better to determine the places of the celeftial bodies, and to
underftand the conftituticn of the heavens more clearly, aftronomers have
conceived or deferibed feveral circles, called the circles of the fphere, by
which the celeftial world is divided and meafured out. Some of thefe
are called great circles, as the equinodial, ecliptic, meridian, &c. and
others fmall circles, as the tropics, parallels, & c. The equinodtial line
is a circle which we imagine to invert the whole world, and is fo called,
becaufe, whenever the Sun, in his progrefs through the ecliptic, comes to
this circle, it makes equal days and nights all round the globe, as he
then rifes due eaft, and fets due weft, which he never does at any other
time of the year. This equinodfial line is conceived to be three hundred
and fixty degrees in its whole circumference ; and each of thefe degrees
are divided into fixty minutes, or lixty equal parts of a degree, and thefe
again into as many féconds. The meridian is another great circle, con­
fiding alfo of three hundred and fixty degrees, extending from one polar
point to the other, and twice cutting theequinoftial line, compafling the
whole world from north to fouth, as the equinoftial does from eaft to
weft, and terminates at the fame point where it began. The equinodlial
line is fixed and immutable, and is of neceflity always conceived to be
in one and the fame place; but the meridian is mutable, and may circle
the world in any or in all degrees of the equator, as we may have occafion
to conceive or imagine ; it muft however, uniformly divide the fphere
into two equal parts, which are called hemifpheres. The polar points
are tbofe two points in the immenfe ball of the world which are cqui-
diftant from the equinoétial line, the one in the utmoft northern, and the
other in the utmoft fouthern, point. The three hundred and fixty degrees
of the equinodtial line are called the longitude of the world, becaufe they
are in order as the Sun and ftars move in their circuits through the fpaci-
ous heavens in their refpedtive orbs. But the three hundred and fixty de­
grees of the meridian are called the latitude of the world, becaufe they
i mete
OF A S T R O L O G Y . 85
mctc out that diftance wherein the Sun and all the ftars, in a certain
breadth one from another, move in their circuits from eaft to weft.
Now the Sun, in his annual progrefs from weft to eaft, does not keep
the equinoftial line, but declines from it at one part of the year to the
north, and at another part of the year to the fouth; and the planets alfo
obferve the fame order in their progrefs, except that the Sun always keeps
the fame conftant track, whereas the planets often vary in their declina­
tions from the equinoctial line. Hence another great circle is conceived
in the heavens, called the Zodiac, which is likewife divided, as all the
great circles are, into three hundred and fixty degrees; but this circle
being as it were the high road of the planets, and comprehending fo much
of the heavens as the Sun and planets fwerve in their declinations, is con­
ceived to be twenty degrees broad ; and it is confined to this fpace, be-
caufe none of the planets ever reach beyond ten degrees north, or ten de­
grees fouth, from the equinodtial line; and the Sun’s path or track in the
Zodiac is called the ecliptic line, becaufe the eclipfes only happen w hen,
the Moon is alfo in this line. ,
The Zodiac is alfo divided into twelve equal parts, called the twelve
Signs, or houfes o f heavon ; and, thefe beginning where the Sun enters the
equinoctial to the northward, the firft fign is named Aries, and the reft
in order arc called Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquaries, and Pifces. Theie figns confift of
thirty degrees each ; and, being all of them divided into four equal parts,
determine the four feafons of the year. Now, when the Sun enters into
the fign called Cancer, he is in his greateft north declination, and at that
time is diftant from the equinoctial line twenty-three degrees to the
north; which occaiions another circle to be deferibed, called the tropic
of Cancer, the center of which being the north pole, it comprehends
as much of the extremity of the round world as falls under twenty-
three degrees and a half from the equator to the northward. And, when
the Sun enters the fign Capricornus, he is in his utmoft fouth decli­
nation, and occaiions another circle to be deferibed, called the tropic
of Capricorn, as many degrees from the equator to the fouth as the
other tropic is to the north. A t the diftance of forty-five degrees from
each of thefe tropics two other circles are imagined, called the arftic
and antarflic circles, which, being but little more than twenty degrees
diftant from each pole, do likewife encircle fome fmall portion of the
extremities of the world. The inferior circles, called parallels, run
from eaft to weft, and ferve to divide the heavens into feveral fpaces be­

86 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N
Ancient tradition has handed down to us the origin of that important
circle called the Zodiac, with the realon .why \t ¡s fb named, and the inge­
nious method which the firft ir^n made ufe of to know exactly the line
which the Sun dcicribcs under the heavens jn the perpetual changings of
its place, and to divide the year into equaj portions. This tradition is
found in two ancient authors, the one J^oman, the other Greek. The
firft attributes it to the Egyptians • the other, to the firft inhabitants of
Chaldea. They every day law the Sun and th.e whole heayens turning
and puffing from eaft to weft. In the mean time they obferved that the
Sun, by a motion peculiar to it, from day to day receded from fome cer­
tain ftars, and took its place under others, always advancing towards the
eaft. Whilft the Moon was making twelve times that revolution, the
Sun made it only once; but flic began the thirteenth again, before the
Sun had as yet compleated it^ own. The habit of dividing the year into
pretty near twelve lunations, made them wifh that they had twelve divi-
fions of a year perfedtly equal, or twelve months, which might be exadtly
equivalent to the year itfelf, and which mighr, as it were, be pointed at
with one’s finger in the heavens, by (hewing fome certain ftars under which
the Sun pafles during every one of thefe months. Here is then the me­
thod in which they divided the courfe of the Sun in twelve equal portions
or collections of ftars, which are called aftcrifms or conftellatiuns. Our
aftronomers took a couple of brafs open veflels, the one pierced at the
bottom, and the other without any orifice below. Having flopped the
hole of the firft, they filled it with water, and placed it fo as that the wa­
ter might run out into the other vcflel, the moment the cock fhould be
opened. This done, they obferved in that part of the heaven, where the
Sun has its annual courfe, the rifing of a ftar, remarkable either for its
magnitude or brightnefs; and, at the critical inftant it appeared on the
horizon, they began to let the water flow out of the upper vcflel into the
other during the reft of the night, and the whole following day, to the
very moment when the fame ftar, being come to the eaft again, began to
appear anew on the horizon. The inftant it was again feen, they took
away the under veflel, and threw the water that remained- in the other
on the ground. The obfervers were thus fure of having one revolution
of the whole heaven, between the firft rifing of the" ftarj ^nd its return.
The water, which had flowed during that time, might then afford them
a means of meafuring the duration of one whole revolution of the heaven,
and of dividing that duration into feveral equal portions; fince, by dividing
that water itfelf into twelve equal parts, they were fure of having the re­
volution of a twelfth part of the heaven during the efflux of a twelfth
part of the water; they then divided the water of the under veflel into
twelve parts perfectly equal, and prepared two other fmall veflels capable
of containing exactly one o f thofe portions, and no more. They again
poured
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 87
poured into the great upper veflel the twelve parts of water all at once,
keeping the veflels ihut. Then they placed under the cock, ftill ihut,
one of the two fmall veiTels, and another near it to fuccced the firft as
foon as it ihould be full.
All thefe preparations being ready, they, the next night, obferved that
part of the heaven towards which they had for a long while remarked that
the Sun, the Moon, and the planets, took their courfes, and ftaid for the
rifingof the conftellation which is fince called Aries. The Greeks, per­
haps, gave that name to fome ftars different from thofe which went by it
before the flood; but this enquiry is not neceflary at prefent. The in­
flam Aries appeared, and they faw the firil ftar of it afeending, they let
the water run into the little meafure. As foon as it was full, they re­
moved it, and threw the water out. In the mean time they put the other
empty meafure under the fall. They obferved exadlly, and fo as to re­
member very well, all the ftars that rofe during all the periods which the
meafure took in filling ; and that part of the heaven was terminated in
their obfervations by the ftar which appeared the laft on the horizon, the
moment the meafure was juft fu ll: fo that, by giving the two little veflfcls
the time neceflary to be alternately failed to the brim three times each
during the night, they had, by that means, one half of the courfe o f the
fun in the heaven, that is, one half of the heaven itfclf; and that half
again was divided into fix equal portions, of which they might fhew and
diftinguiih the beginning, the middle, and the end, by ftars, which, from
their fize, number, or order, were rendered diftinguifhable. As to the
other half of the heaven, and the fix other conftellations which the fun
runs over therein, they were forced to defer the obfervation of them to
another feafon. They waited till the fun, being placed in the middle o f
the now known and obferved conftellations, ihould leave them at liberty
to fee the other during the night. *
Doubtlefs, fome precautions were neceflary, not to miftake as to the
fall of the water, which mail flow more flowly in proportion as its mafs
is lefs high. However, after having, by this or fome fuch means, made
themfelves fure of the great annual courfe which the fun faithfully fol­
lows in the heavens, and of the equality of the fpaces filled by the twelve
colletftions of ftars that limit that courle, the obfervers thought of giving
them names. They in general called them the ftations or the houfes of
the fun, and afligned three of them to each feafon. They then gave
each conftellation a peculiar name, whofe property did not only confift
in making it known again to all nations, but in declaring, at the fame
time, the circumftance of the year (which was of concern to mankind)
when the fun ihould arrive at that conftellation«

By a particular care of Providence, the dams of the flock commonly
happen to be pregnant about the end of autumn; they bring forth
during the winter and in the beginning of the fpring; whence it
happens that the young ones are kept warm under the mother during
the cold, and afterwards eafily thrive and grow acftive at the return of
the heat. The Iambs corne the firft, the calves follow them, and the
kids fall the laft. By this means the lambs, grown vigorous and ftrong,
may follow the ram to the fields, as the fine days com e on. Soon after
the calves, and at laft the kids, venture abroad, and, by increasing the
flock, begin to augment the revenues o f their mafter.
Our ancient obfervers, feeing that there were, during the fpring, no
produftions more ufcful than lambs, calves, and kids, gave the coiifte]-
lations, under which the fun pafies during that feafon, the names of
the three animals which enrich mankind moft. The firft was named
Aries, the fecond Taurus, the third the two kids, Gemini, the better
to charailerize the fecundity of goats, which more commonly bring
forth two young ones than one, and an abundance of milk more than
iufficknt to nourifh them.
The bulk of mankind had already very often remarked, that there was
a point to which the fun raifed itlelf in its coming towards them, but
which it never exceeded ; and that it afterwards funk daily, in receding
from them, for fix months together, till it arrived at another point a great
way under the firft, but below which it never defeended. This retreat
of the fun, made very flowly, and always backward, gave the obfervers
the occaiion of diftinguiihing the ftars, which follow the two kids, or
Gemini, by the name of the animal that walks backward, viz. the crab.
When the fun pafies under the next conftellation, it makes our climate
4 eel fultry heats, but chiefly the climates where men were at that time
all gathered together. When poets attribute to that conftellation the
fiercenefs and raging of the lion, of which it bears the name, it is very
ealy to guefs at what might determine that choice from the beginning.
Soon after, the houfing of the hay and the corn is entirely over through *
out the eail; there remain on the ground only a few ears fcattered here
and there, which they caufed to be gleaned by the leaft neceiTary hands ;
this work is left to the youngeft girls. How then could they reprefent
the conftellation, under which the fun fees no longer any crops on the
ground, better than by the name and figure of a young maid gleaning $
The wings you fee her have in the fpheres are ornaments added o f later
date, alter the introdu&ion of fables. The virgin, which follows the
Lion, is certainly no other than a gleaning girl, or, if you w ill, a reaper;
and, left we ihould miftake her fun&ions, ihe befideshas in her hand acluf-
ter of ears; a very natural proof of the origin here attributed to her.

The perfeft equality of days and nights* which happens when the Sun
quits the fign Virgo, caufedaftronomers to give the next lign the name of
Libra, that is, o f a balance« The frequent difeaies which the Sun leaves
behind him, orcaufes by his retiring, procured the next iign the name of
Scorpio; becaufe it is mifehievous, and drags after it a fling and venom.
Towards the end o f autumn, the fall of the leaf expofes wild beafts, leav­
ing them lefs covering : vintage and harveft are over; the fields are free ;
and it is of ill confequence to fuffer the propagation of beafts at the ap­
proach o f winter. Every thing then invites us to hunt, and the fign, in
which the Sun is at that time* has from thence obtained the name of
Sagittarius; that is, the archer, or huntfman. What is the proper and
diftin&ive charadter of the wild goat, or Capricorn, of which the firft
fign of winter has the name ? it is to look for its food, getting from the
foot of the mountains to the higheft fummit, and always climbing from
rock to rock: the name of Capricorn was then fit to inform men of
the time when the Sun, having reached the loweft verge of its courfe, was
ready to begin to afeend again towards the higheft, and to continue to do
fo for fix months together. This is quite the reverfe of the crab (Cancer);
and the happy concurrence of the oppoiite characters o f thefe two ani­
mals is a proof of what directed the firft obfervers in the impofition of
all thefe names. Aquaries and Pifces, without any difficulty, mark out
the rainy feafon, and the time of the year when fifties, fatter and nicer than
in any other time, bring on again the profit and pleafure of fiihing. It
may be remarked, that, of the twelve conftellations, there are ten, the
names of which are borrowed from feveral animals; which caufed aftro-
nomers to give the annual circle, which they compofe, the name of Z o­
diac. It is as much as if you would fay, the circle o f animals.
By this very plain induftry, men acquired a new method of meafuring
time, and of regulating all their works. They already knew, without
any trouble or care, how to regulate the order of their feafts and common
bufinefs, by infpection only of the phafes of the Moon. From the know­
ledge of the Zodiac, they obtained an exact knowledge of the year : the
conftellations became to them fo many very fignificant figns, which*
both by their names and refpective fituations, informed them of the or­
der of their harveils, and of the cautions they were to take, in order to
bring them about, openly and daily ihewing them how long they were to
flay for them ; the people were neither obliged to caft up the days, nor
mark out the order of times, to regulate themfelves. Twelve words, ap­
plied to twelve different parts of the heaven, which every night revolved
before their eyes, were to them a part of knowledge no lefs convenient
and advantageous than eafy to be acquired. When men, after the fetting
of the Sun, faw the ftars of the fign Aries afeend the oppofite horizon,
and dillant from the Sun by one half of the heaven, they then knew that
9o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
the fun was under the fign Libra, which, being the feventh of the celef-
tul figns, was diftant from the firft by one whole half of the Zodiac.—
When at the approach of day they faw in the middle of the heaven, and
at an equal diftance from eaft and weft, the fineft ftar of the lign Leo, they
eafily underftoed that the fun, then ready to rife, was at the diftance of
three figns from Leo, and removed towards the eaft one quarter part of its
circle. Thus, without feeing the ftars which the fun drowned by its
brightnefs as he came under them, they faid, with a perfedt affurance, that
the fun is now in Scorpio ; two months hence* we (hall have the ihorteft
day. They could, on fight of a fingle conftellation, placed in the eaftern,
or middle, or weftern, part of the heaven, immediately fay where the fun
was, how far the year was advanced, and what kind of work it was fit
they ihould bufy themfelves about. After this manner fhepherds and
farmers ftill regulate their works; and, if we at prefent are now ignorant
of the ftars, if we are not able to determine the diftance between one
conftellation ihewn us and the adtual place of the fun, it is becaufe we
can read and write. The firft men perufed the heavens for want of writ­
ing ; and it is on account of the conveniency of writing that the gene­
rality of men now difpenfe with looking among the ftars for the know­
ledge of the operations and order of the year. But writing itfclf, that
fo ufeful invention, is one of the produces of aftronomy; and it may be
eafily (hewn alfo, that the names given the twelve celeftial figns gave
birth to the invention both of painting and writing. The hiftory of the
heavens ftill promifes further novelty, and it will continue to inform us
of the helps for which we are indebted to the ftudy of nature.
Now, merely to know and to underftand thefe divifions of the heavens
is nothing more than fpeculative aftrology, commonly called Aftronomy ;
but, to attain to the knowledge of Aftrology in general, we muft be con-
verfant in the affe£lions and qualities of the heavenly matter, and of the pla­
nets and fixed ftars. It is generally imagined that the fixed ftars are /ali­
ened in the eighth orb of the celeftial heaven, and only move as that orb
doth, and uniformly together, about one minute’s fpace in a wholeyear;
but reafon has not abfolutely determined this point, fo as to leave it quite
fatisfaftory, or incontrovertible. The fixed ftars are obferved to differ
from the planets by their twinkling or fparkling; whence philofophers
have conceived them to fhine with their own innate light, the fame as the
fun does. The number of ftars difcoverable in either hcmifphere is
not above a thoufand. This at firft may appear incredible, becaufe they
feemto be without number; but the deception arifes from our looking
confufedly upon them, without reducing them into any order*. If we
but look ftedfaltly upon a pretty large portion of the iky, and count the

ftars
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 91
ftars in it, wefhall be furprifed to find them fo few ; and, if we conii-
der how feldom the moon meets with any ftars in her way, although
there are as many about her path as in other parts of the heavens, we
may foon be convinced that the ftars are much thinner fown than peo­
ple are aware of. The Britifh catalogue, which, befides the ftars vifible
to the naked eye, includes a great number which cannot be feen without
the affiftance of a telefcope, contains no more than three thoufand in both
hemifpheres. From what we know of the immenfe diftances of the fixed
ftars, the neareft may be computed at 32,000,000,000,000 o f miles from
the earth, which is farther than a cannon-ball would fly in feven mil­
lion of years! Thefe ftars, on account of their apparently various mag­
nitudes, are diftributed intofeveral clafles or orders; thofe which appear
largcft are called ftars o f thefirft magnitude \ the next to them, in fize
and luftre, ftars o f the fecond magnitude; and fo on to the ftxth , which
confift of the fmalleft that can be feen by the naked eye. This diftri-
bution having been made long before the invention of telefcopes, the
ftars which cannot be feen without the help of thefe inftruments are
diftinguiflied by the name oi telefcopic ftars.
For the fame reafon that the ftars within the belt or circle of the zo­
diac were divided into conftellations, fo have been thofe on either fide
of i t ; viz. to diftinguifh them from one another, fo that any particular
ftar may be readily found in the heavens, by the help of a celeftial globe,
upon which the conftellations are fo delineated as to put the moft re­
markable ftars into fuch parts of the figures which repiefent them as
are moft eafily diftinguifhed ; and thofe ftars which could not be brought
into any part of thefe figures are called unformedftars. The number of
the ancient conftellations is forty-eight : viz. upon the zodiac twelve;
upon all that region of the heavens on the north-fide of the zodiac,
twenty-one ; and upon the fouth-iide fifteen more ; making in the
whole forty-eight conftellations. But, the more modern philolophers
and aftrologians having added a number of others, I ihall let the whole
down in their proper order.

Thefe conftellations, or groupes of fixed ftars, have doubtlefs their
diftinft energy and inflence in the operations of nature ; although we
have not means fufficient to diftipguiih them all, according to their
peculiar virtues. The nearer they aie fituated to the ecliptic line, and
the zodiac, fo much the apter are they to operate in the common adts
of nature; and fo much the more eaiily allured into the opportunities
of our acquaintance. O f the firft magnitude we have extraordinary in-
ftances of that ilar in Leo, called Cor Leonist in twenty-five degrees of the
iign, to be of the nature of Mars and Jupiter mixed together ; and is a
ftar greatly contributing to noble qualifications, and kingly favour. Fa­
mous alio is the knowledge of Spica Virginisf a ilar of Virgo by concilia­
tion, but in thefign Libra : this ftar partakes both of the nature of Venus
and Mars, and contributes greally to ecclefiaftical preferments. After
thefe are very well knoyn the ilars called Aldebaron in Gemini, and
A n tares
9 4
A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
HvJarcf in Sagittarv, both ftars of the nature of Mars, provoking to
courage and magnanimity, but inclining to violence and cruelty. O f
the feeor.J magnitude are the South Balance, and the Head of' Pollux,
both liars of a furious and violent nature. O f the third magnitude,
the Head c f Hed'ifdy or s ihoi, is famous for its mifehievous inclinations ;
and io are the two A jf'es, liars of the fourth magnitude. O f the fifth
magnitude are the Pleiades, ftars of remaikable influence, and celebrated
for their fweet and benevolent rature. Stars of the fixth magnitude
are very fmall ; y^t, notwithftanding this, they are not without their
operations upon earthly things ; as in the breail of the Crab, called
Pr&Jepe, are leveral little liars which appear only like a white cloud,
and yet the force of this ccnflellation has been often felt in the affairs
of mankind. Thefefived liars alfo often prove their force in the change
of weather, as they happen to rife, culminate, or fet, with the fun,
moon, and planets.
But the conilellations which form the twelve figns of the zodiac have
obvioufly the moil powerful and moil immediate operation upon n u n ;
and the reafon is, becaufe they form the pathway of the fun, moon, and
planets, in all their peregrinations, and thereby receive from them a
more forcible power and energy. And, as thefe figns form a confiderable
part of the Science of Aftrology, we Hull confider them under all their
various qualities and affections, both with refpect to their operations upon
nun’s body and upon the four feafons of the year. Thefe figns are
known or diilinguifhed by the following characters ;
or Aries
» Taurus
n Gemini
Cancer Libra
Leo T
tt Scorpio
Virgo x Sagittarius
vf Capricornus
~ Aquaries
X Pilces
Th ey are placed in this order, and divided into four equal parts, an-
fwering to the four quarters of the year, becaufe the equator cuts and
divider the circle of the zodiac at the point beginning with Aries, and at
the oppofite point of Libra, dividing the whole into twp equal parts,
confilLng of fix northern and fix fouthern figns. But the reafon why
the fun’s courfe begins and is reckoned from Aries is, as tradition in­
forms us, becaufe the fun, when firil brought into exiftence, was
placed in this fign. And this is not an unreafonable conjeture, fince
the fpiing quarter begins when the Sun enters Aries, and brings with
it mércate <m
d length of days, and all nature begins to multiply and
fl c: lL, und, as it were, to rile into new life. The fix northern figns
u n .none with Virgo, and the fix fouthern commence with Libra; but
the northern figns have always been confidered of a more efficacious and
;nature than the fouthern. .
Philofophers
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 95
Philofophers have alfo affigned another reafon for this order and di-
vifion of the twelve figns of the zodiac, namely, That Nature works by
oppofition and contrariety, and thus brings about the four ftates of all
elementary bodies, viz. generation, confervation, corruption, and anni­
hilation. As therefore generation is the firft Hate, and is produced and
nouriihed by heat, they begin with the fiery fign Aries. The next
quality being confervation; or durability, they fignify the fame by
placing an earthy fign next in order, fince earth gives permanency and
fixation to corruptible bodies. The third quality being corruptible,
it is reprefented by an airy fign, becaufe air is known to be the fource
o f putrefa&ion. T he laft Hate of an elementary body is its final end,
or diilolution; and, as water difiblves all corruptible bodies, fo have
they defcribed it by placing a watery fign the laft of all. In this ar­
rangement o f the figns of the zodiac we may further obferve, that two
pafiive principles are placed between two adtive ones ; and, as our all­
wife «Creator hath fo conftructed nature, that the oppofition of one
thing ihould occafion the exiftcnce or duration of another, fo we may
obferve it in the divifions of the zodiac ; for inftance, Aries, a fiery fign,
is placed oppofite to Libra, which is an airy fign; and in all refpects
refembles a man fitting before a fire with a pair of bellows in his hands,
blowing to keep it burning : for, without air, fire is foon extinguiihed.
In the fame manner it is with the water and the earth; but, to make
thefe obfervations more apparent, we will arrange the figns of the zodiac
under all their different qualities and forms.

Some figns are controvertible in their nature, according to their
accidental fituation in the heavens, as n and a in the eaft are hot
and dry, 8 and m hottiih, t cold and moift, Yt cold and dry. In
the weft n m and Yt are cold and moift, 8 cold, t hot and dry.
Thefe qualities are abfolutely neceflary to be obferved in judging of the
weather.
When the moon, or lord of the afcendant, is pofited, at a nativity,
in any of the figns wc term hot, the native will be manly and vigorous,
and
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 97
and choler will abound in him ; but, if any of thofe figns we term cold,
he will then be meek, womaniih, and effeminate ; all which affeftions
proceed from phlegm.
There are figns called quadrupedian, or four-footed, as T « Si t
becaufe thofe creatures from whence they are named have four feet ;
and in a nativity, where either of them afcend, they import that the con-;
ftitution of the native partakes much of the nature of that creature they
reprefent ; for inftancc, if Aries afeends, then he will be hot and dry, and
partake of the qualities of the ram ; if Taurus be lord of the afeendant,
he will be furious, as the bull ; if Leo afcend, he will be in nature bold
and magnanimous; if Sagittarius, he will be perfevering and intrepid;
if Capricorn, he will be luftful and libidinous, like the goat. So there
are figns of humanity, as n m - , and the firft part of / ; and in
nativities where any of thefe figns afcend, or in which the lord of the
afeendant is placed, itfignines that the native is of a friendly difpofition.
humane, affable, and courteous ; of an excellent carriage, and engaging
behaviour. Again, fome figns are called fruitful, as as nt >
£ • and, it
the afeendant or his lord, or the moon, be placed in any one of thefe, or
if the cufp of the fifth houfe has one of thefe upon it, or if his lord be
pofited in one of them, the native will have many children, or will be
of a prolific conftitution ; but, if barren figns pollefs the aforefaid places,
then, according to the plain courie ot nature, fterility and barrennefs
will follow. There are alfo fome figns termed mule, as ss tri x . If
any of thefe afcend in a nativity, and Mercury, who is the general fig-
nificator of fpeech, be afflicted by the planet Saturn and the Dragon’s
Tail in an evil houfe of heaven, and the afeendant alfo vitiated, the na­
tive will be born dumb ; if Mercury be free, and the afeendant only
afflifted, or if the afeendant be free, and Mercury afflicted, the native
will be generally filent, and flow of fpeech. But, if figns of voice afcend
in a nativity, as u m A » t the native will poilefs a volubility of
fpeech, and be a good orator. Again, fome figns arc feial, i. e. brutifh,
or favage ; fuch are si and the lafl put of Sagittarius. Some are
termed hoarfe, or whittling, as T « a ^ ; and whcnev£r_Leq, or the
laft part of Sagittarius, attend ia a nativity, the native will be brutiflily
inclined, and polfefs an unfeeling and cruel difpofition. Thofe perfons,
in whofe nativity V b Si kf are horofcopical, have a conflint hoarfe-
nefs or whittling in their delivery and fpeech, though otherwife .quick
and voluble enough ; and thofe perfons are geaerally crooked, deformed,
or imperfedtly born, who have « attending,, and Caput Algol pofited
in the attendant. *
There are alfo degrees which are termed mafeuline, feminine, light,
dark, fmoky, pitted, azimene or deficient, and increafing fortune ;
thefe are all exhibited at one view in the following table.

In the firft column againft n
r you find 8. 35. Jo, under the column of
mafculine degrees ; and under the column of feminine, you have 9. 22,
which (hews that the firil eight degrees of T are mafculine, and the
ninth degree feminine; from 9 to 15 are mafculine, and from 15 to 22
ieminine ; and from 22 to 30 are mafculine. The ufe of which is, that, if
the principal fignificator in a nativity be pofited in the degrees and figns
mafculine, be the native male or female, it argues, that he or ihe ihall
inherit a more maiculine temper and refolution than ordinary. But, if
the fignificator be in feminine figns and degrees, then the native will be
more effeminate, timid, and lefs robuft. The fame obfervation holds
good with refpect to the other figns and degrees, as in the table they
Hand directed. The fourth column points out that there are certain de­
grees in each iign, which are termed light j and, if either of thefe afeend
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 99
in a nativity, the native will be of a fairer and clearer complexion than
ordinary. The fifth column {hews that there are decrees termed dark or
obfeure; and, whenever thefe happen to be horofeopica! in a nativity, they
declare the native to be of a dark or fallow complexion, and, if he Ihould
be born deformed, his deformity will be confidefably greater. The fixth
.column ihews which degrees of the zodiac are called fmoky ; and, if any
of them arife on the eaftern fineter at the time of birth, they declare the
native of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor fwarthy, but partaking of
both ; and fimilar to his complexion will be his underftanding. The
feventh column ihews which of the degrees of the zodiac are called void;
and, if the afeendant in the radix of any nativity be pofited in them; it
delares an imbecility in the judgment and underftanding of the native;
and, the farther he enters into converfation or bufinefs, the more obvious
will this defect appear. The eighth column points out what degrees in
each of the twelve figns^arecalled deep and p i t t e d and thefe, in a nativity,
fignify, that if the afeendant, his'lord, or the moon, be fituated in any of
them, the native will be of a hafty and imperfect fpeech, incapable of ex­
prefling his defires, or of declaring his fentiments; and will be always in-
volved'in vexatious litigations and difputes ; and, like a man in a p it or
fnare, will want the afliffance of another to help him out. H ie ninth
column diftinguiflies the azimcnc> lame, or deficient^ degrees; and, if in a
nativity any one of thefe afetnd, or the lord of the afeendant, or the moon,
be in any of them, the native will be crooked, lame, or deformed, or in
fome manner vitiated in the member or part o f' t1fe1 $&dy That the fign
governs in which fuch azimene degiees {lull happen to be. This rule
is lb unexceptionable and invariable, that it ought to be well coniidered
in the judgment of every nativity. The tenth column points out all the
degrees in the twelve figns that are augmentors or increalers of fortune;
and the knowledge to be derived from them is, that if, in a nativity, the
cufp of the fccond houfe, or lord of the fecond, Jupiter^ or part of for­
tune,' be in degrees augmenting, they theft become arguments of much
wealth; and prefage that the native {hall, according to hit capacity or
fituation in life, attain to ftill greater honour, riches, and pieferment.
But, befides thefe general properties, each of the figns poifeis a parti­
cular efficacy and virtue peculiar to themfelves, or to that part of the hea­
vens wherein they bear rule. For, as upon earth all giound will not
bring forth the fame fruit, fo in the heavens all places or parts thereof
will not produce the fameefteits. Upon the earth, a man in his journey
rides over ten miles, more or lefs, upon the fands; at another time, he
traces over as many miles more upon the clay ; and, after that, he pro­
ceeds on another ten miles upon the marl and gravel. Similar to this,
by the moil corre£t obfervation, appears to be the alternate variations of
No. s, X the
100 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
the heavenly matter. This we (hall render apparent, by examining the
nifijrent and d:ftindt qualities of every fign throughout all the degrees cf
the zjehae. Anti firft
Of A R I E S , nr.
This fign, cbfervathn and experience both inform us, is hot and
(Pv, 1 ke a high gravelly cr fandy ground j and, when this fign afccods
at a birth, ot it the fun ( r moon l>
e pefited in it, it ufually contributes
unto the native a dry body, lean an i fpare, ftrong and large bones and
limbs, piercing eyes, a iwarthy or fallow ccmple.sion, and fandy-co-
loured or red hair, and inclines him to be choleric, brutal, violent, and
intemperate; that is, thC fign naturally produces thefe effetts* But, if
the planets Jupiter or Venus be in the attendant, or in this fign, it very
materially alters both the conftitution and complexion of the native for
the better ; but, if Saturn or Mars be pofited there, then it is altered
confiderably for the worfe For, as iome land will bear wheat, and
other land only rye, and yet, by adding comport to it, or by ordering it
accordingly, the nature of the mold may oftentimes be changed, and
made to bring forth fruit contrary to its own nature :— juft the fame it
is when the planets, or their afpetls, fall ftrongly into a lign; they quite
change its nature and effedt; buf, if none of thele happen, then the fign
Aries, and the reft, unalterably purine their own nature.
Aries is an equinoctial, cardinal^ diurnal, moveable, fiery, choleric,
hot and dry, luxurious, violent, fign; eaftern, and of the fiery triplicity.
It is the day-houfe of Mars, and confifts of twelve ftars. The difeaies
produced by this fign «are the fmall-pox and falling ficknefs, apoplexies,
head-ach, megrims, baldnefs, and all cliieafes of the head and face, hair-
lips, ring-worms, meafles, fevers, convulfions, and the dead palfy.—— ■
The regions over which Aries prefides, are England, France, Baftarnea,
Syria, Paleitine, the Upper Burgundy, Germany, Switzerland, the Up­
per Silefia, the Leffcr Poland, Denmark, and Judea; the cities of Naples,
Capua, Ancova, Imolia, Ferrara, Florence, Verona, Lindavia, Brunf-
wick, Craconia, Marieilles, SaragoiTa, Barganum, Caefarea, Padua, Au-
gufta, and Utrecht. In .man, it governs the head and face; and the
colour it rules is white mixed with red.

Taurus differs greatly from the preceding fign, being in nature cold
and dry, as if out ot a hoc and landy foil a man were on a fudden to
enter into a cold deep clay country. If this fign attends at a birth, or is

pofited in the fun or, moorTs place, it ufually renders a perfon with a
broad brow, thickJips, dark curling hair, of qualities fomewhat brutal
and unfeeling; melancholy, and flow to anger ; but, when once enraged,
violent and furious, and difficult to be appeafed. Hence it follows that
this is an earthy, cold, dry, melancholy, feminine, fixed, nodturnal,
fign ; fouthern, and of the earthy trlplicity ; the night-hpufe of Venus ’;
and contains twenty-three ftars. The difeafes incident to this fign "are,
cold and dry melancholic habits, fluxes of rheum, wens in the neck, fore
throats, king’s-evTI, quirileys, and confumptions. The regions over
which itprefides are, Perfia, Media, I^arfliTaj Cyprus, theiflandsof the

opolis, Leipfic, and Nantz. In man, it governs the neck and throat;
and the colour it rules is red mixed with citron.

Gemini is in nature hctt.snd-moift, like a fat and rich foil ; and pro­
duces a native fair and tall, of ftraight body and fanguine complexion,
rather dark than clear ; the arms long, but oftentimes the haodsjind feet
ihort and fleihy : the hair and eyes generally a dark hazle, of perfect
fjgfiT^^afTdTfvfely wanton look, the underflanding Lund, and judicious
in worldly affairs. Gemini is defined an airy, hot, moift, fanguine,
double-bodied, mafculine^diurnal, weftern, fign, of the airy triplicity.
It is the day-houfe of Mercury; and confifls of eighteen fixed ftars.

of a ihort and imall ftaiure, the upper part of the body generally large,
with a roundJ ace, brown hair, and grey eyes ; of qualities phlegmatic
and heavy, effeminate conftitution, and fmall voice ; if a woman, inclin­
ed to have many children. Cancer is theTJnTyTioufe of the moon, and

is the firft fign of the watery or northern triplicity; it is a watery, cold,
n oift, phlegmatic, feminine, noiturnal, moveable, fruitful, folfticial,

orders of the bread: and ftomach, pleurifies, indigeftion, (hortnefs of
breath, want of appetite, cancers, coughs, phthifics, dropfics, furfeits,
impofihumes, aithmas, and confumptions. The regions which are

Leo is the only houfe of the fun, by nature fiery, hot, dry, mafeuline,
choLric, barren, and commanding; eaftern, and of the fiery triplicity;
and claims twenty-feven of the fixed ftars. When this fign afeends in

commanding eye, fprightly look, and ftrong voice ; the vifage oval, and
ruddy, or ianguine ; a refolute and courageous fpirit, afpiring mind, free
and generous heart, with an open, bold, and courteous, difpofition. It
muft however be remarked, that the beginning and middle of this fign
produce all the above faculties in the greateft degree of ftrength ; and
that, in the litter part of the fign, the native will be rather fpare and
thin, with light flaxen hair, and of a weaker conftitution and tempera­
ture. The difeafes produced under Leo, are all the paflions and affec-
ti >ns of the heart, as convulfions, fwoonings, tremblings, qualms, violent
fevers, plagues, peftilences, fmall pox, meafies,-yellow jaundice', pleu-
rifies, fore eyes, and all difeafes ariling from chcler, and all pains in the

middle ftature, of a ruddy brown complexion, black or dark brown lank
hair, the vifagefonaewhat round, the voice fmall and fhrill, a witty and
ingenious mind, ftudious, but rather unftable; and, if the afcendant be
free from the malevolent afpetls of Saturn, and this fign afcends with
Mercury therein, the perfon who hath them fo fituated at his birth will
be an excellent orator. The particular difeafes of this fign, are thofe
produced by worms, wind, and obftruftions; hardnefs of the fpleen, mo­
ther, hypocondriac melancholy, cholic, and iliac paffion. The regions

It may perhaps be though^ by fotne of my readers, that the foregoing
influences, attributed to the twelve figns of the zodiac» are merely con-
jeétural and imaginary. But the artift, whoever he be, that has the
good fenfe to determine for himfelf, by the itandard of experience and
obfervation only, will carefully attend to all that has been ftated, as the
particular effef! and virtue of each refpeflive fign. For, without an
intimate acquaintance with them, no correé! judgment can be formed
upon any nativity; but, on the contrary, if the foregoing are ftri&ly at­
tended to, no one who tries them will ever And an error in his calculations.

H E importance of thefe celeftial luminaries in the fcale of Nature,
and the force of their operations upon the animal and vegetable
fyftems, require that they ihould be thoroughly inveftigated, and their
properties well underftood, before any advances are made in calculating
nativities, or refolving horary queftions. W e ihall begin with Saturn,

Saturn is the mod fupreme, or moil elevated, of all the planets, being
placed between Jupiter and the firmament, at about feven hundred and
eighty millions of miles from the fun. It travels in its orb at the rate of
eighteen thoufand miles every hour, and performs its annual revolution
round the fun in twenty-nine years, one hundred and fixty-feven days,
and five hours, of our time; which makes only one year to that planet.
And, though it appears to us no larger than a ilar of the third magnitude,
yet its diameter is found to be no lefs than fixty-feven thoufand Engliih
miles; and confequently near iix hundred times as big as the earth ! This
planet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, fomewhat refembling the ho­
rizon of an artificial globe ; and it appears double when feen through a
good telefcopc. It is inclined thirty degrees to the ecliptic, and is about
twenty-one thoufand miles in breadth ; which is equal to its diilance
from Saturn on all tides. There is reafon to believe that the ring turns
round its axis, becaufe, when it is almoft edge-ways to us, it appears fome­
what thicker on one tide of the planet than on the other ; and the thickeil
edge has been feen on different fides at different times. But, Saturn hav­
ing no vifiblc fpots on his body, whereby to determine the time of his
turning round his axis, thedength of Ins days and nights and the poiition
of his axis are wholly unknown to us. He has two degrees forty-eight
minutes north, and two degrees forty-nine minutes fouth, latitude. He
’ ‘ No. 5. Z is
J c 8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
is retrograde one hundred and forty days* and ilationary five days before
and five days after his rétrogradation.
Saturn is in nature cold and drv, occifioncd by his being fo far re­
moved trom the heat of theTun ; abounds in moifl vapours, and is a me-_
hncholy, earthy, maiculine, folitary, diurnal, maleyoknt, planet ; and
the greater infortune. His effects, when lord ofThe afLindant, or prin­
cipal ruler of a nativity, with all his qualities, are as follow : he produces
a middle ftature, with a dark, fwarthy, or pale, complexion, fmall leer­
ing bLck eves, broad forehead, lean face, lowering brow, thick nofe
and lips, large ears, black or brown hair, broad ihoulders, thin beard,
with fmall lean thighs and legs. If thia planet is wJl dignified at the
time of birth, the native will be of an acute and penetrating imagination ;
in his condutil, auilere ; in words, ixibived ; in fpeaking and giving, very
fpare ; in labour, patient ; in arguing or dilputjng, grave ; in obtaining
the good^ of this life, lludious and iolicitous ; in his attachments, either
to wife or friend, confiant and unequivocal ; in prejudice or refentment,
rigid and inexorable. But, if this planet be ill dignified at the time of
birth, the native will be naturally fordid, envious, covetous, miftruilful,
coward]}, fluggilh, outwardly diflcmbling, falfe, ftubborn, malicious,
and'i'irpetually diflatished with himftlf, and with all about him. When
Saturn is oriental, the human llature wiil be fhorter than ulual, and, when
occidental, thin, lean, and lefs hairy. If his latitude be north, the na­
tive will be hairy and corpulent ; it without any latitude, he will be of
large bones and mufcles ; and, if meridional, fat, fmooth, and flefhv ; in
his full dation, llrong and well-favoured; and, in his fécond dation,
weak and ill-favoured. "I hele remarks likewife hold good with rcfpedl
to all the other planets. It is all'o to be remarked, that, when Saturn is
lignificator of travelling, he betokens long and laborious journeys, peril­
ous adventures, and dangerous lmprifonment. §aturn governs the lpleen,
right ear, bones, teeth, joints, and retentive faculty, in man; and rules
every thing bitter, iharp, or acrid. His government and effects in all
other refpects are as follow.
Difeafes under Saturn.— All melancholy and nervous affeftions, quartan
agues, Jailing ficknefs, black jaundice, tooth-ach, leprofy, deflexions,
fnlulas, pains in the limbs and joints, gout, rheumatifm, hemorrhoids,
dcafnefs, infinity, palfy, confumption, dropfy, chin-cough, Traflures,
apoplexies, and all phlegmatic humours; and, in conceptions,"he fUte"
the firil and the eighth months.
Herbs and plants under Saturn.-~Bzr\cy, fumatory, beech-tree, bifoil,
birdsfoot, biftort, buckfhorn plantane, vervane, fpinach, bearsfoot, wolf­
bane,

ing his herbs, the ancients turned their faces towards the eaft, in his
planetary hour, when in an angle, and eflentially fortified, with the moon
applying to him by fextile or trine.
Stones, metals, and minerals — The fapphire, and lapis lazuli, or that
ftone of which azure is made; likewile all unpolifhed black and blue
Hones; tVu ioadllone, tin and lead, and the drofs of all metals.
Animals tinder Saturn.— The afs, the cat, the hare, moufe, dog, wolf,
bear, elephant, bafilifk, cr ■ . ’ . Icorpion, adder, ferpent, toad, hog,
and all creeping things produc * > putrcfa&ion. Alfo the tortoife, the
eel, and all kinds of ihell-hih- Among birds, the crow, lapwing, owl,
bat, crane, peacock, thrufh, blackbird, oflrich, and cuckow.
Weather and winds.— lie brings cloud), dark, obfeure, weather, with
cold biting winds, and thick, heavy, condenied, air. Thefe are his
general effedts ; but the more particular and immediate alterations of
weather produced by this planet are only to he known by his feveral
petitions and afpedts with other planets, fortitudes and debilities, of
which I fh ill treat at large in my third book. Saturn delights in the
eaftern quarter of the heaveus, and caufeth the ealtern winds. He is
friendly to Jupiter, Sol, and Mercury, but at enmity with Mars, Venus,
and the Moon. «
Triplicity and Jigns.— He governs the fign Capricorn by night, and
Aquaiies by day, and the airy^ triplicity by day. O f the weekly days
he rules- Saturday, the iirft hour frorTTun riling, and the eighth hour
of the fame day, and the firft hour of Tuefday night.
Regions under Saturn.— Bavaria, Saxony, Stiria, Romandiola, Ravenna,
Conilantia, and Ingoldfladt.
Tears.— Saturn’s greateil year is four hundred and iixty-five ; his great
is fifty-feven ; his mean, forty-three and a half; and his lead, thirty.
The fignification of which, in aftrology, is, that, if a kingdom, city,
town*
n o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
town, principality, or family, takes its rife when Saturn is eiTentially
and occidentally ftrong, and well fortified, it is probable the fame will
continue in honour and profperity, without any material alteration, for
the fpace of four hundred and fixty-five years. Again, if in a nativity
Saturn is well dignified, is lord of the geniture, and not affli&ed by any
crofs-afpeds, then the native, according to the common courfe of na­
ture, may live fifty-feven ycuis ; if the planet be but meanly dignified,
then the native will not live more than forty-three years j and, if he be
weakly dignified, he will not live more than thirty years; for the na­
ture of Saturn at beft is cold and dry, which are qualities deftrudive to
health and long life in man. -
Or^.—-Saturn's orb is nine degrees before and after any afped ; that is,
his influence begins to operate, when either he applies, or any planet ap­
plies to him, within nine degrees of his perfed afped; and his influence
continues in force until he is ieparated nine degrees from the afped partial.
J U P I T E R , v . -
Jupiter is the next planet below Saturn, and called the greaterfortune.
He appears to our fight the largeft of any ftar in magnitude except
Venus ; and is of a bright refplendent clear afped. Modern aftronomers
have proved him to be four hundred and twenty-fix millions of miles from
the fun, and above a thoufand times bigger than our earth ; he goes in
his orbit at the aftonifhing rate of near twenty-fix thoufand miles an hour,
and his diameter is computed at eighteen thoufand Engliih miles, which
is more than ten times the diameter of the earth. He conpletes his
courfe through the twelve figns of the zodiac in eleven years, three hun­
dred and fourteen days, and twelve hours. He is confiderably fwifter
in motion than Saturn ; but to us his mean motion is four minutes
iii ty-nine fcconds; his iwifter motion fourteen minutes. He has exaltation
in fifteen degrees of Cancer ; fuffers detriment in Gemini and Virgo,
and receives his fall in fifteen degrees of Capricorn. His greatefl lati­
tude north is one degree thirty-eight minutes ; and his greatefl: latitude
iouth one degree and forty-minutes. He is retrograde one hundred
and twenty diys; and ftationary five days before and four days efter his
rctrogradation. His orb, or radiation, is nine degrees before and after
any of his afpecis. .
Jupiter is a diurrud^jmafculinc, planet, temperately hot and moift,
airy and fanguine ; author of temperance, modefty, fobriety, and juf-
tice. He rules thelungs, liver, reins, blood, digeftive virtue, and na-

legs, with long feet; his q .u yi \ !■ ;- .‘ud m. nly, and his converfation
grave and .commanding. And, it v. .*1 dignified at the birth, this planet
betokens moil admirable manners and difpofition to the native. He will
be in general magnanimous, faithful, and prudent, honourably afpiring
after high deferts and noble a&ions, a lover of fair dealing, defirons of
ferving all men; juft, honeft, and religious; of eafy accefs, and of affable
manners and converfation; kind and affe&ionate to his family and friends;
charitable and liberal to the utmoft extent of his abilities ; wife, prudent,
and virtuous, hating all mean and fordid actions. But, if Jupiter be ill-
dignified and afflifted with evil afpetts at the time of birth, he then be­
tokens a profligate and carelefs difpofition, of mean abilities, and Shallow
underftanding; a bigot in religion, and obftinate in maintaining errone­
ous dodrines; abandoned to evil company; eafily fcduccd to folly and
extravagance ; a fycophant to every one above him, and a tyrant m his
own family. If the planet be oriental at the birth, the native will be
more fanguinc and ruddy, with larger eyes, and more corpulent bodv,
and generally has a mole or mark upon the right foot. If occidental,
then it beftows a moil fair and lovely complexion, particularly to a fe­
male; the ftature fomewhat fhorter, the hair light brown, or approaching
to flaxen, but thin round the temples and forehead.
Difeafes under Ju p iter.— All infirmities of the liver, obftructions, pleu-
rifics, apoplexies, inflammation of the lungs, infirmities in the L-lt ear,
palpitations of the heart, cramps, pains in the back, difordeis in the
reins, proceeding from corruption of blood ; quinfies, windinefs, fevers,
proceeding from a fuperabundance-of’ blpj^dj all griefs in the head, puliV,

W eather and winds.— Jupiter produces pleafant, healthful, and ferene,
weather ; and governs the north and north-eaft winds. He is friendly
with Saturn, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and L u n a; but at enmity with
M ars. We call Thursday his day; and he rules on Sunday night. His
influence commences an hour after fun rife, and he governs the firfthour
and the eighth.
Signs and triplicity.— He rules the celeftial fign Sagittary by day, aad
Pifces by night. 'I he effect of which is, that, if Jupiter hè^figîTïficator
in the revolution of any year, by day, and in Sagittary, he is fo much the
more fortified; and, if in Pilces, in a nofturnal revolution, the effeft is
the fame. rl he obfervation extends to all the other planets. He pre­
fixes e ver the fiery triplicity bv night ; fo that, if Jupiter be in twenty
degrees of Aries, or thrtenrh degreé of Leo, in any diurnal revolution,
he {hall be accounted peregrine, as not having any dignity therein, being
neither in his houfe, exaltation, term, triplicity, or face; but, in a noc­
turnal revolution, he would not be accounted peregrine, for then h^
would have triplicity in both thefe figns. '
'Journeys.— When he is fignificator, he denotes pleafant travellin
iucctis, fafety, health, and mirth.

Mars ¡s next located to Jupiter, and is the firft planet above the earth
and Moon's orbit. His diftance from the Sun is computed at one hun­
dred and twenty-five millions of miles ; and, by travelling at the race of
forty-feven thoufand miles every hour, he goes round the Sun in fix hun­
dred and eighty-iix of our days, and four hours; which is the exact length
of his year, and contains fix hundred and fixty-feven days and three quar­
ters; but every day and night together is forty minutes longer than with
us. His diameter is four thoufand four hundred and forty-four miles,
which is but a fifth part fo large as the earth. He is of a deep fiery red
colour, and, by his appulfes to fome of the fixed liars, feems to be encom-
pafled by a very grofs atmofphere. His mean motion is thirty-one de­
grees twenty-feven minutes ; and his fwift motion from thirty-two to
forty-four minutes. His exaltation is in twenty-eight degrees of Capri
corn ; his fall in twenty-eight degrees of Cancer, and his detriment in
Libra and Taurus. His greateil north latitude is four degrees thirty-one
minutes; and his greatefi fouth latitude fix degrees forty-feven minutes.
He is retrograde eighty days, and ftationary two or three days before ré­
trogradation, and two days before direction. His orb or radiation is feven
degrees before and after any of his afpeds.
Mars is a mafeuline nodturnal planet, in nature hot and dry, choleric
and fiery, the leflef infortune, author of quarrels, diflentions, llrife, war,
and battle; and rules the gall, left ear, head, face, fmell, imagination, and
attradlive faculty, of man. This planet, prefiding at a birth, renders up a
ftrong well-let body, of ihort ftature, but large bones, rather lean than
fat; a brown ruddy complexion, red, fandy, flaxen, or light brown, hair;
round face, iharp hazel eyes, confident bold countenance, active and fear­
. lefs. If well dignified, the native will inherit a courageous and invincible
difpoiition; unfufceptible of fear or danger; hazarding his life on all oc-
cafions, and in all perils ; fubjefl to no reafon in war or contention,; un­
willing to obey or fubmit to any fuperior ; regardlcfroftrfl things in com-
p;nlon of triumphing over his enemy or antagoniit ; ana yet prudent in
the riJan.fgemçhLrjaud_diret:tiqn of his pnvatejroncerns. If the planet be
ill dignified, and affiided with crois afpedts, the party will then grow up
atrumpeter of his own fame and confequence, without decency or honelly ;
a lover of malicious quarrels and affrays; prone to vvîclretfïïdfsand~ffaugh'
ter, and in danger of committing murder, of robbing on the highway, of
becoming a thief, traitor, or incendiary ; of a turbulent lpirit, obfeenc,
raffi, inhuman, and treacherous, fearing neither God nor man; given up
to every fpecies of fraud, violence, crueltv, and oppretlion. If the planet

a dry conftitution.
Difeafes under Mars.— Peftilential fevers, plagues, murrains, tertian

The Moon is next below Mars, being a fatellite or attendant on the*
earth, and goes round it from change to change in twenty-nine days twelve
hours and forty-four minutes; and round the Sun with it every year.
The Moon’s diameter is two thoufand one hundred and eighty miles; and
her diilance from the earth’s centre is two hundred and forty thoufand
miles. She goes round her orbit in twenty-feven days feven hours and
forty-three minutes, moving about two thoufand two hundred and ninety
miles every hour ? and turns round her axis exadly in the time that (he
goes round the earth, which is the reafon of her always keeping the fame
fide towards us, and that her day and night taken together are as long as
our lunar month. She is an opaque globe, like the earth, and (bines only
by reflecting the light^the Sun ; therefore, whilft that half of her which
is towards the Sun is enlightened, the other part mull be dark and invifi-
ble. Hence (he difappears when (he comes between us and the Sun; be-
caufe her dark fide is then towards us. When (he is gone a little way
forward, we fee a little of her enlightened fide; which ilill encreafes to
our view as (he advances forward, until (he comes to be oppofite the fun,
and then her whole enlightened fide is towards the earth, and (he appears
with around illumined orb, which we call the F u ll Moon*, her dark fide
being then turned away from the earth. From the full (he feeins to de-
creafe gradually as (he goes through the other half of her courfe, ihewing
us Ids and lefs of her enlightened fide every day, till her next change, or
C
v njunfiion with the Sun, and then (hedifappears as before. Her mean
niotita :s thirteen degrees, ten minutes, and thirty-fix feconds; her fwift,
v ‘i«Jrnal motion often varies, but never exceeds fifteen degrees two mi­
nutes in twenty-four hours. Her greateft north latitude is five degrees and
feventeen minutes; and her greateft fouth latitude is five degrees and
twelve minutes, or thereabouts. She is never ftationary nor retrograde,
but always diretl; though, when (lie is flow in motion, and goes lefs than
thirteen degrees in twenty-four hours, (he is confidered equivalent to a
retrograde planet. Her exaltation is in the third degree of Taurus, her
detriment in Capricorn, and her fall in three degrees of Scorpio. Her
No. 6. B b orb,
n 6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
orb, or radiation, is twelve degrees before and after any of her afpe&s j and
ihe rules over all infants until the feventh year of their age.
The Moon is feminine, noflumal, cold, moift, and phlegmatic. Her
influence, in itfelf, is neither fortunate nor unfortunate, but as ihe hap­
pens to fall in with the configurations of the other planets, and is then
either malevolent or other wife, as thofc afpe&6 happen to be. And un­
der thefe circumflances ihe becomes the moft powerful of all the heavenly
bodies in her operations, by reafon of her proximity to the earth, and the
fwiftnefs of her motion, by which ihe receives and tranfmits to us the
light and influence of all the fuperiers, by her configurations with them.
When ihe has rule in a nativity, ihe produces a full ftature, with fair and
pale complexion, round face, grey eyes, lowering brow, very hairy, ihort
arms, thick hands and feet, l'mooth body, inclined to be fat, corpulent,
and phlegmatic. If ihe be impeditgd.of the Sun at thetime of birth, ihe
leaves a blemiih on or near the eye; if ihe be impedited in fuccedent
houfes, the blemiih will be near the eye; but if with fixed ftafS, and in
unfortunate angles, the blemiih will fall in the eye, and will affedt the
fight. If ihe be well dignified at the nativity, the native will be of foft
engaging manners and difpofitiou, a lover of the polite arts, and of an
ingenious imagination, fond of novelties, and given to.travelling, or ramb­
ling about the country; unilable, and providing only for the prefent time,
carelefs of futurity ; timorous, prodigal, and eaiily affrighted; but loving
r
eace, and defiring to live free from the cares and anxieties of the world,
f the native be brought up to a mechanical employment, he will be
frequently tampering with a variety of different trades, but purfuing none
of them long together. If the Moon be ill dignified at the birth, the
native will be then ilothful, indolent, and of no forecafl; given up to a
drunken, difordcrly, beggarly, life, hating labour, or any kind of bufinefs
or employment. When oriental, he inclineth more to corpulence; but,
when occidental, rather lean, awkward, and ill-formed.
Difeajcs under the Moon.— The palfy, cholic, complaints of the bowels,
the ltone and gravel, overflowings or obftru£tions of the terms, dropfy,
fluxes and difcntcry, all cold and rheumatic complaints, worms in the ,
belly, diforders of the eyes, furfeits, coughs, convulfions, falling fids-
nefs, klng’s-evil, impoffhumes, fmall-pox, lethargy, mealies', "phrenzies,
apoplexies, vertigo, lunacy, and all crude humours in any part of the bo­
dy. In conception ihe rules the feventh month; and governs the brain,
the itomach, bowels, bladder, the left eye in man, and the right eye in
woman, and the whole expulftve faculty.

clouded iky, and fudden ftorms; with the Sun, (he varies the weather
.according to the time of the year; with Venus, warm and gentle
ihowers ; with Mercury, ftormy winds, and rain. But in the third part

Signs and triplicity.— Of the celeilial figns, (he has only Cancer allotted
to her for her houic. She rules the earthy triplicity by night viz. Tau­
rus, Virgo, and Capricorn. She is in Frien3 ihip with Jupiter, Sol, Ve­
nus, and Mercury; but at enmity with Saturn and Mars. O f the
Weekly days flie rules Monday, and Thurfday nights,

one hundred and eight; her mean year is fixty-fix; and her leaft year is
twenty-five.

Venus is the next planet below the earth and Moon, having her orbit
within that of the earth. She is computed to be fifty-nine millions o£
miles from the Sun, and, by moving at the rate of fixty-nine thoufand miles
every hour, ihe pafles through the twelve figns of the zodiac in two
hundred and twenty-four days ieventeen hours of our time nearly. Her
diameter is feven thoufand nine hundred and fix miles, and by her diurnal
motion (lie is carried about her equator forty-three miles every hour, be­
sides the fixty-nine thoufand above-mentioned. When file appears weft:
of the Sun, ihe rifes before him in the morning, and is called the morning
J}ar-, but, when fhe appears eaft of the Sun, (he fhines in the evening after
he fets, and is then called the evening Jlar ; and continues alternately far
the fprxe of two hundred and ninety days in each of theie fituations. It
may perhaps be thought furprifing at firft, that Venus ihould continue
longer on the eaft or weft fide of the Sun than the whole time of her pe­
riod round him ; but the difficulty vaniihes when we coniider that the
earth is all the while going round the Sun the fame way, though not fo
quick as Venus; and therefore her relative motion to the earth muft in
every period be as much flower than her abfolute motion in her orbit as the
earth during that time advances forward in the ecliptic, which is two hun­
dred and twenty degrees. T o us fhe appears through the telefcope in all
the various fhapes of the Moon. Her mean motion is fifty-nine minutes
eight féconds ; and her daily or fwift motion is from fixty-two minutes
to one degree twenty-two minutes ; but never greater. Her utmoft la­
titude, either north or fouth, never exceeds nine degrees two minutes. Her
exaltation is in twenty-feven degrees of Pifces, her detriment in Aries and
Scorpio, and her fall in twenty-feven degrees of Virgo. She continues
retrograde forty-two days, and is ftationary two days before and two days
after her ftate of rétrogradation. Her orb, or radiation, is feven degrees
before and after any of her afpe&s. In the human'ftruâure/ffie govefns
the reins, back-bone, feed,andfeminal veflels; alfo the neck,throatrërtaft$,
and expulfive faculty; and rules the light blue and white colours.
Venus is a feminine planet, temperately cold and moift, noilurnal, the
fmaller fortune, author of mirth and conviviality, alluring to procreation
and to the propagation of the fpecies. When ihe afeends at a nativity,
ihe gives a handfome, well-formed, but not tall, ftature; complexion fair
and lovely, bright fparkling eyes, of a dark hazel or black, the face round,
regular, fraooth, and engaging; the hair light brown, hazel, or chefnut,
ihining
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 119
fliitiing and plentiful; the body regular and well-proportioned; of a neat,
fmart, and airy, difpofition; generally with dimples in the cheeks or chin,
and often in both; the eyes wandering, and naturally amorous; in motion
light and nimble; in voice foft, eafy, fweet, and agreeable, inclined to
amorous converfation, and early engagements in love. If well dignified
at the time of birth, the native will be of a quiet, even, and friendly, d if-.
pofition, naturally inclined to neatnefs, loving mirth and cheerfulnefs, and
delighting in muiic; amorous and prone to venery, though truly virtuous,
if a woman; yet ihe will be given to jealoufy,* even without caufe. If
the planet be ill dignified, then will the native be riotous, profligate, a­
bandoned to evil company and lewd women, regardlefs of reputation or
character; a frequenter of taverns, night-houfes, and all places of ill-
fame ; delighting in all the incitements to incefluous and adulterous prac­
tices; in principle a mere athieft, wholly given up to the brutal paffions
of unbridled and uncultivated nature. If Venus be oriental at the time,
the ftature will be tall, upright, and ftraight; but, if occidental, ihortand
{looping, though comely and well-favoured. I f £he be fignificatrix, in a
journey, and well*dignified, ihe portends much mirth, pleafure, and fuc-
cefs, and promifes fafety and good fortune by the way.

Next to Venus, and within theorbits of all theother planets, is Mercury,
and of courte, the neared; of them all to the central fun. He completes
his revolution, or traverfes through the twelve figns of the zodiac, in eigh-
ty-fevendays and twenty-three hours of our time nearly ; which is the
length of his year. But, being leldom feen, on account of his proximity
to the Sun, and having no fpots viiible on his furfacc or diik, the time of
his rotation upon his own axis, and the length of his days and nights, are
as yet unknown to us. Hisdiftance from the Sun is computed to be thir­
ty-two millions of miles, and his diameter two thoufand lix hundred.
He moves round the Sun at the rate of ninety-five thoufand miles every
hour ; and receives from that luminary a proportion of light and heat al-
moft feven times as great as that of the earth. At the times he becomes
vifible, he appears of a bright lilver colour, though generally faint and
duikifh to the naked eye. His mean motion is fifty-nine minutes and
eight féconds, and fometimes fixty minutes ; and his diurnal motioy is
moll: times one hundred minutes a day. His greateft latitude,- both nôrth
..nd lbuth, is three degrees thirty-three minutes. His exaltation is in
fifteen degrees of Virgo; his detriment in Sagittarius and Pifces ; and
hh fall in fifteen degrees of Pifccs. lie is retrograde twenty-four days ;
and is ftationary one day before and one day after rétrogradation. His orb
or radiation is Icven degrees before and after any afpeft. He prefides over
Wcdncfday, and Saturday night; and governs the brain, tongue, hands,
;eet, and intellectual faculty uf man.
Mercury
1 2 1
O F A S T R O L O G Y .
Merfcury is the leaft of all the planets ; in nature cold, dry, and me­
lancholy ; but author of the moil pointed wit, ingenuity, and invention.
He is occaiionally both mafculine and feminine; and lucky, or unlucky,
as his poiition in the heavens may happen to be. When he is in conjunc­
tion with a mafculine planet, he is mafculine, when with a feminine pla­
net, feminine ; good and fortunate, when joined with the fortunes; but
evil and mifchievous, when in conjunction with malevolent afpefts. When
he governs a nativity, he renders up a tall, ftraight, thin fpare body,
narrow face, and deep forehead ; long ftraight nofe, eyes neither black
nor grey ; thin lips and chin, with but little beard ; brown complexion,
and hazel or chefnut coloured hair ; the arms, hands, and fingers, long
and (lender ; and thighs, legs, and feet, the fame. I f orientally pofited,
the ftature will be ihorter, with fandy hair, and fanguine complexion,
fomewhat fun-burnt; the limbs and joints large and well fet, with fmall
grey eyes. But, if occidental, the complexion will be quite fallow, lank
body, fmall (lender limbs, hollow eves, of a red caft, and of a dry conftitu-
tion. If Mercury be well dignified at the nativity, the perfon will inherit
a ftrong fubtil imagination, and retentive memory ; likely to become an
excellent orator and logician, arguing with much eloquence of fpeccb, and
with ftrong powers of perfuafion ; is generally given to the attainment of
all kinds of learning ; an encourager of the liberal arts ; of a (harp, witty,
and pleafant, convcrfation; of an unwearied fancy; and curious in the
fearch of all natural and occult knowledge: with an inclination to travel
or trade into foreign countries. If brought up in the mercantile line, he
will be ambitious of excelling in his merchandize, and will moft times
prove luccefsful in obtaining wealth. But, if the planet be ill-dignified,
then the native will betray a difpofition to dander, and abufe the charac­
ter of every one without diftindion ; he will be a boaiter, a flatterer, a
iycophant, a buly-body, a tale-bearer, given to propagate idle tales and
falfe ftories; pretending to all kinds of knowledge, though a mere ideot
in his intelledual faculty, and incapable of acquiring any (olid or fub-
ftantial learning; apt to boaft of great honefty, yet very much addide J
to mean and petty thievery.
d ;j:afts under M ercury.— A ll ,diforders of the brain, vertigoes, mad'
neft, defects of the memory, convuliions, afthmas, imperfections of the
tongue, hearfenefs, coughs, inuffling in the nofe, ltoppages in the heu\
dumbnels and whnever impairs the intelledual faculty, and gout in the
hands and icet. In conceptions he governs the hxth month.
Herbs and plants.— Calamint, carrots, carraways, champignon, dill,
fern, fennel, bogs fennel, germander, horehound, hazel nut, liquorice,
fweet marjoram, mulberry-tree, oats, pariley, pellitory of the wall,

Stones and metals,— The'emerald, agate, red marble, topaz, mill-ftone,
marcafite, and Inch as are of divers colours. Alio, quickfilver, block-tin,

Aih. And among birds, the linnet, parrot, popinian, iwallow, martin,
pye, and bulfinch.
W eather and winds.— He ufually caufes rain, luil-ftones, thunder,
lightning, £cc. according to the nature of the planet he happens to be
in configuration with. He delights in the northern quarter of the hea­
ven«, and produces luch winds as are fignified by the planet to which he
applies in ufpe£t.
S'gns and triplicity.— He has for his houfes the celcftial llgns Gemini
and Virgo; and he rules the airy triplicity by night, namely, Gemini,
Libra, and Aquaries.
R iricns.— Flanders, Greece, Egypt, and the Eaft and Weft Indies.
Tears.— H is greateft year is four hundred and fifty; his great is feven-
ty-fix; his mean year is forty-eight; and his leaft year is twenty.

Sol, or the Sun, is an immenfe globe or body of fire, placed in the
common centre, or rather in the lower focus of the orbits of all the
planets and comets; and turns round his axis in twenty five days and fix
hours, as is evident by the motion of thefpots vifible on his furface. His
diameter is computed to befeven hundred and fixty-thrcc thoufand miles;
and, by the various attractions of the circumvolving planets, he is agi­
tated by a fmall motion round the centre of gravity of the l'yftem. He
pafies through the twelve Tigris of the zodiac in three hundred and fixty-
fivedays, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and fifty-feven feconds, which
forms the tropical or lolar year, by which ilandard all our periods of time
are meafured. His mean motion is fifty-nine minutes and eight feconds;
but
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 123
but his fwift or diurnal morion is fixty minutes, and fometimes fixty-one
minutes, fix feconds. He conftantly moves in the ecliptic, and is there­
fore void of latitude ; and, for the iamc reafon, is never ftationary or re­
trograde. Iiis exaltation is in nineteen degrees of Aries ; his detriment
in Aquaries; and his fall in nineteen degrees of Libra. His orb or radia­
tion is fifteen degrees before and after all hisafpedts. In man, he governs
the heart, back, arteries, the right eye of the male, and left of the female;
and the retentive faculty. He prefides over Sunday, and Wedncfday
night. He is friendly with Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the
Moon ; but is conftantly at variance with Saturn.
The Sun is in nature mafeuline, diurnal, hot, and dry, but more tem­
perate than Mars, and, if well dignified, is always found equivalent to one
of the Fortunes. When he prefides at a birth, the native is generally of
a large, honey, ftrong body, of a fallow fun-burnt complexion, large
high forehead, with light or fandy curling hair, but inclined to be foon
bald; a fine, full, piercing, hazel eye; and all the limbs ftraight and well
proportioned. If he is well dignified, the native w ill be of a noble,
magnanimous, and generous, difpofition ; high-minded, but very humane;
of a large and benevolent heart, affable, and courteous; in friendfhip,
faithful and fincere; in promifes flow, but pundual. The folar man is
not of many words ; but, when he fpeaks, it is with confidence, and to
the purpofc; he is ufually thoughtful, lecret, and referved; his deport­
ment is (lately and majeftic; a lover of fumptuoufnefs and magnificence;
and poflefles a mind far fuperior to any fordid, bafe, or diihonourable,
practices. If the Sun be ill-dignified, then will the native be bqrn o f
a mean and loquacious difpofition ; proud and arrogant; difdaining all
his inferiors, and a fychophant to his fuperiors; of /hallow underftanding,
and imperfcdl judgm ent; reftlefs, troublefome, and domineering; o f no
gravity in words, or fobernefs in a£iions; prone to mifehievoufnefs, au-
fterity, uncharitablenefs, cruelty, and ill nature.
Difeafes o f the Sun.— A ll palpitations and trembling of the heart,
fainting and fwooning, weaknefs of fight, violent fevers, cooler, dif-
orders of the brain, tympanies, cramps, foul breath, all diforders of the
mouth and throat, catarrhs, defluxions, and king’s evil. In conception,
he prefides over the fourth month.
H erbs and plants.— Angelica, avens, afh-trec, balm, pne-blade, lo-
vage, burnet, butter-bur, camomile, celadine, centaury, eye-bright,
fig-tree, St. John's wort, marigolds, miiletoe, piony, Peter’s wort, pim­

herbs, the cuftom has been to do it in the Sun’s proper hour, which may
be found by the table calculated, for that purpol'e, in this work, when
he is in an angle, well fortified clTentially, and no way impeded ; and let
the Moon apply to him by trine or Textile.

it is kke the apple of the eye in form, the carbuncle, chryfolite, the ilone
called iris, the heliotropion, hyacinth, topaz, pyroyphylus, pantaurus,

Animals.— The Sun rules all ilately, bold, ftrong, furious, and invin­
cible, animals, as the lion, tyger, leopard, hyena, crocodile, wolf, ram,
boar, bull, horfc, and baboon. Among fifties, he rules the fea-calf, whofc
nature is to refift lightning ; all ihell-fifh, the ftar-fiih for its remarkable
heat, and the fiihes called ftrombi. Among birds, the eagle, phoenix,
i'wan, cock, hawk, buzzard, lark, and nightingale.
Weather and winds.— He produces weather according to the proper
ieafon of the year; in the fpring, warm and gentle ihowers; in fummer,
if in afpedt with Mars, extemity of heat; in autumn, fogs and mifts* and
in winter, fmall drizzling rain. He delights in the eaftern part of the
heavens, and brings eaftern winds.
Signs and triplicity.— O i the celeftial figns, he has only Leo for his
houfe. He rules the fiery triplicity by day, viz. Aries, Leo, and Sa­
gittarius.
. Regions.— He rules the fourth climate, Italy, Bohemia, Sicilia, Chal­
dea, the Roman Empire, and North and South America.
Tears.— His greateft year is one thoufand fix hundred and forty : but
others fay, only four hundred and fixty-one; his great year is one hun­
dred and tw enty; his mean year is fixty-ninc* and his Jeaft is
nineteen. i

The Head of the Dragon is mafculine, partaking of the nature both
of Jupiter and Venus ; but the Dragon’s Tail is feminine, and of a di­
rect oppofite quality to the head. Thefe are neither figns nor conftella-
tions, but are only the nodes or points wherein the ecliptic is interfered
by the orbits of the planets,and particularly by that of the Moon; making
with it angles of five degrees and eighteen minutes. One of thefe points
looks northward, the Moon beginning then to have northern latitude;
and the other points fouthward, where (he commences her latitude fouth.
But it muft be obferved, that thefe points do not always abide in one
place, but have a motion of their own in the zodiac, and retrograde-
wife, three minutes and eleven feconds per day; completing their
circle in eighteen years and two hundred and twenty-five days; fo that
the Moon can be but twice in the ecliptic during her monthly period;
but at all other times the will have a latitude or declination from the
ecliptic. The Head of the Dragon is confidcred of a benevolent nature,
and almoft equivalent to one of the Fortunes, and when in afpeft with
evil planets, is found to leflen their malevolent effeds in a very great
degree. But the Dragon’s Tail I have always found of an evil and un­
happy tendency, not only adding to the malevolence of unfortunate af-
peds, when joined with them ; but leflening confiderably the beneficial
influences of the Fortunes, and other good afpe&s, whenever found in
conjunftion with them.
Should the reader be defirous of more particular information on the
planetary fyftem, I beg leave to recommend to his attentive perufal, the
agronomical works of the ingenious M r. Fergufon. And, in order to
bring all the foregoing particulars, concerning the periods, diitances,
B^lks, &c. of the planets, into one point of view, I fubjoin his following

T o arrive at a proper degree o f correftnefs in our refcarches into futu­

no further. For the more a man endeavours to ftrain a judgment be­
yond the natural tendency of the planets, and the more he fwerves from
truth in putting down their ftrength or debility, the more he augments
his error, and betrays his inexperience. T o avoid this, let the ftudent
acquaint hirnfelf perfectly with thefe tables; and, in pradtice, whenever he
has occafion to collect the fortitudes and debilities either of the planets
or Part of Fortune, let him fubtraft the lefs number from the greater,
and the remainder will be the placet’s excfcfe- of fuperiority or de­
bility; according to which will be his operation upon the fubjedl

Of the PLANETARY HOUSES, and their EFFECTS.
To give a more fubftantial idea of the nature and arrangement of the
twelve houfes of the planets, we (hall confider them according to the
following diagram:
In this fcheme, Cancer and Leo have affigned unto them the two
great luminaries, Sol and Luna; becaufe they are agreeable to each other
in nature; for the Sun, being naturally hot and dry, ihews his effe&s more
forcibly when pofited in Leo than he doth in either Aries or Sagittarius.
And the Moon, for the fame reafon, has Cancer allotted to her govern­
ment, becaufe ihe is cold and moift, and of the nature of this iign; and,
being the firfl of the watery triplicity, and next to the Sun's houfe, ihe
receives her light from him ; and all things are generated by their joint
influence.
Saturn is naturally cold, and therefore an enemy to heat; and, being the
highest and moil remote from the luminaries of all the other planets/
has for his manlion the iigns Capricorn and Aquaries; which are the
oppcfite iigns to Leo and Cancer, and are confcquently cold and moift.
Saturn is accounted the moil obnoxious and moil malevolent of all the
planets, becaufe he oppofes the two great luminaries, which are the
iountains of life, light, and nutrition.
Jupiter
O F A S T R O L O G Y .
Jupiter is placed under Saturn, and has the two ligns that go before
and after Capricorn and Aquaries allotted for his houfes 5 namely, Sagit-
tary and Pifces, which are in trine to the houfes of the two luminaries -,
Pifces, his night-houfe, is in trine to Cancer, the houfe of the noéìurnal
luminary j and Sagittary, his day-houfe, in trine to Leo, the houfe of the
diurnal luminary. Jupiter, being naturally temperate, and having thefe
amicable alpefts, is deemed the moil benevolent o f all the planets to
mankind, and the greater fortune.
/
Mars next in order follows Jupiter, being placed under him ; and there­
fore thofe figns that go before and after the houfes of Jupiter are allot­
ted to Mars, viz. Scorpio and Aries, which are in quartile to the houfes
of thè Sun and Moon, as Aries’s day-houfe is to Cancer, and Scorpio’s
night-houfe is to Leo. And, fince a quartile is found to be an afped of
enmity, he is accounted malignant and unfortunate in an inferior degree
to Saturn, who beholds the luminaries with an oppoiition ; therefore he
is called the lejfer infortunate.
Venus, amore temperate planet, hath appointed unto her thofe houfes
that go before the houfes ot Mars, viz ; Libra and Taurus, which are in
a fextile to the houfes of the two luminaries, and form an alped of love
and amity ; but, becaufe a fextile is not fo ftrong and perfed an afped as
a trine, flie is accounted the lejfer fortune.
Mercury, being fituated within the orbits of the other planets, has figns
allotted him which precede the two houfes of the great luminaries, namely,
Gemini and Virgo; and, becaufe Mercury is never diilant from the Sun
above one fign, he naturally inclines neither to good nor evil, but parti­
cipates either in the good or evil influences of whatever planet he is joined *
with in afped.
The E X A L T A T IO N S and F A L L S o f the P L A N E T S .
The Sun, which is the fountain of life, takes his exaltation in nine­
teen degrees of Aries, becaufe he is then in the higheft northern point
of the ecliptic, making all things to fpring and flouriih, and producing
fine warm weather, and length of days. And he is faid to have his fall
in Libra, becaufe it is the oppofite in the heavens to Aries, in which
the Sun declines to the utmoft fouthern point, and occafions ihortnefs
of days, and cold winterly blafts, deftrutlive to the fruits of the earth.
Now the Moon being contemporary with and partner to the Sun, and
receiving all her light from him, enables her to be vifible to us firft
in Taurus ; and, becaufe it is the firft fign wherein (lie has a triplicity, her
exaltation takes place in Taurus, wherein ihe increafcs in light and mo­
tion.
134 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
tion. But Scorpio being the fign oppofite to Taurus, in which (he de-
creales in light, it is hence allotted for her fall, being the iign immedi­
ately after Libra, and oppofite to Aries, the houle of the Sun’s exaltation.
Saturn, the moil remote planet, is the author of cold, as the Sun is of
heat, and is therefore exalted in that figa wherein heat is diminiihed and
cold increafed, viz. Libra ; and his fall takes place in that fign where cold
is diminiihed and heat increafed, viz. Aries ; which are quite contrary in
nature to the Sun.
Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, and has his fall in Capricorn ; for Jupiter
delights in the noithern part of the heavens, where he ilirs up northern
winds, which increafe fertility and vegetation ; and, his higheil declina­
tion northwards being in Cancer, he is therein exalted. For thé contrary
rcafon he has his fall in Capricorn.
Mars is naturally hot and dry ; and, becaufe his influence and efFe&s are
moil powerful in Capricorn, a fouthern fign, where the fun is generally
hottcii about noon, he is for this rcafon exalted therein j and he takes his
tall in Cancer, quite contrary to the nature of Jupiter; for Mars is hot and
\iuknt, rod Jupiter cool and temperate.
Venus is naturally moill, tfpecially in Pifces, in which fign the fpring
is rr.oiiteued and forwarded in the increafe and ftrength of nature; and
therefore the has the fign Pilces for her exaltation ; and, as Venus is the
mother or generation and procreation, ihe has her fall in Virgo, in the
autumn, when all things wither and fade.
Mercury, becaufe he is dry, and contrary in nature to Venus, is exalted
m Virgo, and has his fall appointed him in Pifces. Virgo is both his
Louie and joy.
The T R I P L I C I T I E S of the P L A N E T S .
A Triplicity means three figns of the zodiac, of one and the fame
nature, making a petfeét triangle; and of thefe triplicities among the
figns there are four, anfwering to the four elements; viz. the fiery tri­
plicity, v.hich conflits of Aries, Leo, and Sagittnry; the airy triplicity,
confiding of Gemini, Libra, and Aquaries ; the watery triplicity, con­
taining Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces; and the earthy triplicity, which
includes Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Thefe figns apply to each other
in a trine in the lame manner as a planet in a fiery fign applies to another
planet in a fiery fign (if in the fame number of degrees) in a trine; and
o f a s t r o l o g y . 135
thus a planet in an airy fign beholds another planet in an airy fign with
a trine; and fo the watery and earthy figns apply in the fame manner; and
each of thefe trine afpefts con fifth of one hundred and twenty degrees.
The Sun and Jupiter have dominion over the fiery triplieity ; the Sun
by day, and Jupiter by night. The Sun by day, bccauie he is hot and
fiery, and of the nature of thefe figns; and Jupiter by night, becaufe he
is temperate, and moderates the extremity of heat. This is called the
eailern triplieity.
Saturn and Mercury have dominion over the airy triplieity, winch Is
weftern ; Mercury by night, and Saturn by day. But, as Libra is the ex­
altation of Saturn, and Aquaries the houfe and fign wherein he has moft
joy, and as Gemini is only the houfe of Mercury, it follows that Saturn
has the principal government in this triplieity.
Mars, both night and day, governs the watery tiiplicity, which is nor­
thern ; and it feems that Mars was appointed to this triplieity to temper
and abate his violent heat; for we find he is more powerful in his malig­
nant effetls in the fign Leo tHn he is in Cancer, therefore he has his
fall appointed him in Cancer, though he is peregrine in Leo.
Venus and the Moon bear rule over the earthy triplieity, which is
feminine and fouthern, cold and moift, producing fouth-eaft winds
and cold moift air; hence this triplieity is afiigned to the care of femi­
nine planets.
The T E R M S of the P L A N E T S .
A Term is a certain number of degrees, in each houfe or fign of the
zodiac, wherein the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,
have a certain priority; but the Sun and Moon have no terms. Thefe
degrees are called terms, ends, or bounds; for the planets have each their
proportions fo allotted therein, that, at the end of a certain number of
degrees, the terms of one planet ceale, and thofe of another begin. For
inliance, from the firft degree of Aries to the fixth aie the terms of Ju­
piter; from the fixth to the fourteenth are the terms of Venus; and fo
of all the reft. Ptolemy, Albumazer, and Bonatus, have all (hewn that
the greater years of the planets are diicovered by their leveral terms or
bounds through the zodiac; which is done by finding what number of
degrees each of the planets have allotted them in each fign ; and then, by
adding them together, the fum will be the number of each of their great
years, as will appear more obviouily by the following example ;

Thefe great years, being added together, make juft three hundred and
uxty degrees, being the whole extent or circumference of the zodiac.
The degrees are in this manner divided into terms, to (hew what pla­
net has moll dignities in a fign, whether by exaltation and houfe, tripli-
city and houfe; or boufe, exaltation, or triplicity, alone; and to that
planet, which has two or more dignities, we affign the firil term, whe- 1
iher he be a fortune or an infortune. If an infortune has not two dig­
nities in a fign, he is placed lail, and the firil term is given either to the
lord of the exaltation, or to the lord of the triplicity, or to the lord
of the houfe, uniformly preferring that planet which has two dignities
to thole that have only one. But an exception to this rule extends to the
figns Cancer and Leo; for Cancer being the oppofite fign to the exalta­
tion of Mars, which is in Capricorn, occafions the firil term of Cancer
to be afiigned to M ars; and, becaufe Leo is the oppofite fign to the*houfe
and joy of Saturn, the firil term of Leo is for this reafon given to Sa­
turn. T o the infortuncs are allotted the lail degrees of all the figns, ex­
cepting thofe of Leo, which are given to Jupiter. The quantity of terms
are divided according to the following method : when Jupiter and Ve­
nus have not two dignities in the fame fign, nor in the fecond, third, or
tourth, houfe, they have feven degrees allotted for their terms. Saturn
and Mars, becaufe they are infortunes, (except in their own houfes,) have
but five, and fometimes only four, three, or two, degrees each. Mercu­
ry, becaufe he is of a mixed nature, has ufually fix degrees allotted him ;
but, when any of the planets are eflentially dignified, they claim each one
degree more;, as Venus in the firil term of Taurus has eight degrees, and
3 Saturn

The P H A S E S of the P L A N E T S .
The planets phafes confiil of the twelve figns of the zodiac, divided
each Into three equal parts; fo that one phafis contains tcndegiees, and
c\eiy fign three phafes. They are called phales, bccaule they fignify or
lepreient the forms, natures, and inclinations, of the fevcral planets ap­
propriated to them. A planet’s term divides aphafis; a phafis divides a
fign ; a fign divides a triplicity ; and a triplicity divides the whole zodiac.
To aicertain the proper phafes of each planet, we begin with Mars
in the equinoftial fign Aries, becaufe it is the houfe of this planet;
where.fore, the firfl ten degrees conilitute the phafis of M ars; the fecond
ten degrees are the phafis of the Sun ; and the third, which make up the
whole thirty degrees of Aries, conilitute the phafis of Venus. The
firil: ten degrees of Taurus make the phafis of M ercury; the fecond ten
degrees are the phafis of the Moon; and the third ten conilitute the phafis
of Saturn. The fiiil ten degrees of Gemini make the phafis of Jupiter;
the fecond ten the phafis of Mars ; and fo on, in the following order,
throughout the twelve figns of the zodiac.
Mars hath the firil phafis in Aries: which is the phafis of ilrength,
magnanimity, and courage; of refolution, confidence, and intrepidity.
The Sun hath the fecond phafis in Aries: and this is the phafis of re­
nown, nujellx, and m ight; of candour, generofity, and noblenefs ot foul;
and herein the Sun has his exaltation. Venus has the third phafis in
Aries : which is the phafis of effeminacy and wanton merriment; of joy,
fporr, and play.
In Taurus, the firfl phafis is attributed to Mercury: and it is the phafis
of mechanical arts, agriculture, and learning; of refined wit, logic, and
oratory. The moon has the fecond phafis in Taurus : and it is the phafis
of power, ambition, and authority ; of violent force, compuilion, and ar­
bitrary fway. Saturn has the third phafis in Taurus: Which is the phafis
ot ciuehy, oppreflion, and bondage ; of poverty, fervitude, and menial oc­
cupations. .
Jupiter hath the firil phafis in G em ini: and this is the phafis of nume­
ration, algebra, and all ngures; of dccyphering hieroglyphic characters,
writing?.

nefs, and fordid gain ; of meannefs, penurioufnefs, and parfimony.—
Mercury has the third phafis in V irgo : and it is the phafis of advanced
age, infirmity ; and weaknefs; o f gradual decline, diilolution, and decay.
The Moon has the firft phafis in Libra: it is the phafis of juftice,
mercy, and truth ; of humanity, liberality, and benevolence. Saturn has
the fecond phafis in Libra : it is the phafis of advantage, emolument, and
gain ; of watchfulnefs, labour, and fubtilty. Jupiter has the third pha­
fis in Libra : which is the phafis of lafeivioufnefs, luxury, and licenti-

No. 7. H h has
i4o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
has the fccond phafis in Sagittary : it is the phaiis of affli&ion, forrow,
anS perturbation of mind ; of internal woe, fufpicion, and miilruft. Sa­
turn has the third phaiis in Sagittary: and it is the phaiis of obftinacy,

lity, benevolence, and honefty ; of conviviality, merriment, and fport.
Mars hath the fecond phaiis in Capricorn : it is the phafis of inordinate
delires,of unbridled pafiions, and intemperate lufts ; of difeontentednefs,
peevilhnefs, and disappointment. The Sun has the third phafis in Ca­

Mars hath the third and laft phafis in Pifces : and it is the phafis of
concupifcencc and luft ; of debauchery, lewdnefs, and profligacy.
The advantage to be derived by a perfedt knowledge of the planets’
phafes will hereafter appear in the judgment of a nativity; for, if the
afeendant on the cufp of any perion’s nativity be found in thefe phafes,
then will the native’s natural difpofition, manners, occupation, and gene­
ral purfuits, be regulated by them, according to the ftrength or debility
of the other afpedts ; for, if the lord of the afeendant, or the Moon, or
planet applying to the afeendant in afpedt, or beholding the lord of the
afeendant, or Moon, are both pofited in phafes of the fame nature, then
will their effedts upon the native be moft powerful and efficacious.
The J O Y S of the P L A N E T S .
The planets are faid to be in their joys, when they are pofited in thofe
houfes wherein they are moil ftrong and powerful; as,

It may perhaps be enquired, why Saturn joyeth not in Capricorn, as
well as in Aquaries, fince both thefe figns are his houfes ? The reafon
is, that in Aquaries he has both houfe and triplicity, and is therefore bet-;
ter dignified, and more potent, in Aquaries than in Capricorn. So like-
wife Jupiter joyeth in Sagittary, and notin Pifces, becaufe in the former
iign he has both houfe and triplicity, but in the latter he has houfe:
only. The fame obfervation extends to the other planets. The Moon,
indeed, has no triplicity; but fhe joyeth in Cancer, becaufe it is a fign>
of her own quality and nature. Hence it appears that Saturn, though ftrong
and well dignified in Capricorn, is much ftronger, and has more digni­
ties, in Aquaries; Jupiter alfo has ftrong influences when pofited in
Pifces, but much ftronger in Sagittary; Mars is potent in Aries, but
infinitely more fo in Scorpio ; Venus has great operation in Libra, but
in Taurus her effefts are more powerful; and Mercury, for the fame
caufe, operates much more forcibly in Virgo than he does in the fign
Gemini. The efficacy of thefe rules having been proved by repeated
experience, it is neceflary for every ftudcnt to confider them with
attention.
The A N T I S C I O N S of the P L A N E T S .
A planet’s antifcion is a certain virtue or influence it acquires by
being pofited in conjunilion with any ftar or planet, in degrees equally dif-
tant from the two tropical figns, Cancer and Capricorn, in which degrees
the Sun, when it arrives, occafions equal day and night all over the world.
For example, when the Sun is in the tenth degree of Taurpfy he is as far
diftant from the firft degree of Cancer as when in the ssdkfidl degree o f
Leo; therefore, when the Sun, or any planet, is pofited in the tenth degree
of Taurus, it fends its antifcion to the twentieth degree o f Leo; that
is, it gives additional force and virtue to any planet at that time in the
fame degree by conjunftion, or that cafteth any afpe£t to it. The planets’
antifeions may at all times be found by the following table.

from each other ; for which reafon it is fom
etim
es called a fexangular
afped, or an hexagon. The Textile is term
ed anafped of im
perfect love,
am
ity, or friendihip; becaufe, w
hentwo planets, or fignificators, are in
Textile to each other, they im
port that any m
atter in difpute, treaty of
m
arriage, or other fubjed of enquiry, m
ay be happily term
inated, or
brought about, by the intervention of friends; or that for want thereof,
the contrary m
ay happen. And, though the Textile afped is fom
etim
es
over-ruled by the m
ore powerful influences of m
alignant ones, yet it
is generally confidered an om
en of the favourable kind.
By a quartile afped, □ , two planets are underftood to be poiited at
ninety degrees, or one fourth part of the circle of the zodiac, fromeach
other; whence it is alfo called a quadrangular or tetragonal afped. The
quartile is confidered an afped of imperfed hatred ; and acts vice verfi
with the fextile, inclining rather to m
alignancy, contention, and mis­
fortune, a
stheother does tofriendihip, harmony, and good fortune.
A trine afped, a , im
ports the planets to be fituated at the diftance of
one hundred andtwenty degrees, or one third part of the circle of the
zodiac, from each other; and is fom
etim
es called a trigonal afped, or
a trigonocrater, implying rule or dom
inion in acertain trigon or tripli-
city. This is an afped of the moil perfed unanim
ity, friendihip, a
n
c
*
peace; and it is fo confidered, becaufe, when the planets are in aa afped
they are pofited in figns precifely of the fam
e triplicity and nature ; that
is to fay, they are both in an earthy, airy, fiery, or watery, fign ; and
confequently both contribute the fam
e influences unim
peded. But, in a
*, which is an afped of imperfed amity, the planets are poiited in
figns of only a partial nature, viz. fiery with an airy, or a
n earthy with a
watery, fign; and, a
sthe fieryfignishot anddry9 andtheairyhotandmoift;
the earthy cold and dry, and the watery cold and moift ; fo the planets
thus pofited, agreeing only in one point out oftwo, give but an imperfed
influence. Thus the diftindions betw
een a* and a aiped, and between
a□an
d £, are founded in reafon and experience.
The oppofition 8 of two planets, fignifies their being poiited at one
hundred andeighty degrees, orjuft half the diftance of the zodiac, apart,
which places them diam
etrically oppofite toone another inthe heavens,
w
hence it is called a diam
etrical radiation. This is confidered an afped
of perfed hatred, or of inveterate m
alice and enmity, a
s m
alignant in
its effeds a
s the trine is benevolent; and of double the deilrudive ten­
dency of the d afped. To inftance this, let us fuppofe two kingdoms,
ftates, focictics, or private gentlem
en, at variance, and it is enquired whe­
th
er thecaufeof difpute m
ay be amicably adjufted ?If afigure be ereded

for the pofitions of the heavenly bodies, an
d the two fignificators, repre-
fcnting the two adverfarics, be in a quartile afpe£i^X.ihould infer, that*
notwithftanding the then fubfifting enm
ity of the parties, with all the
threatened milchiefs attending it, harm
ony m
ay be reftored, if proper
m
eans w
ere uled for that purpofe. But, if the fignificators are found in
aftual oppofition, the dilputc in quertion w
'ould moft probably occafion
hoftiTltv, w
ar, litigation, or duel, or beattended with fom
e alarm
ing con-
fequences, before the m
atter would lubfide. W
herefore an 8 is juilly
term
ed anafpcct ofpcrleit enmity.
Thcfe afpeds arc all divided, for the fake of perfpicuity, intop a rtile
andplatic afpens. A partile afpeit confiders tw
fo planetsj^adHjfo m
any
degrees from each other a
s m
ake a perfed afpei'l ; that is, if Venus be
in nine degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in nine degrees of Leo, they are in
partile trineafpect. Again, if the Sun be in one degree of Taurus, and
the M
oon in one degree of Cancer, they are in apartile fextile afped ; fo
that all perfect afpeds arepartile; andimply the m
atter or thing threat­
ened, whether”
goodor £vit,t0 be n
ea
r,at hand.
Bya platic afped, we a
re to underfland two planets fo pofited, a
s to
adm
it half the degrees of each of their own rays or orbs; for inftance*
if Saturn be pofited in fixteen degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in twenty-'
four degrees of Gemini, then Saturn would be in a platic fextile afped
toJupiter, becaufe Saturn would be fituated within the m
oiety of both
their orbs, which are nine degrees each. The fam
e circum
ilance ap­
plies to the afpeds of all the planets; for, if theirdillancefromeachother
brings themwithin onehalf of each of theirorbs or radiations, whenadd-
cd together, they will then form a platic afped. It m
uit alfo be care­
fully obferved in thefe platic afpects, whether the co-operation of the
two planets is going off, or com
ing on. Inthe above exam
ple, the ef-
feu of Saturn’s platic fextile afped with Jupiter w
as going off ; but, if
wc reverie their lituations, and place Saturn in twenty-four degrees of
Gemini, and Jupiter in fixteen degrees of Aries, then the afpect would
be coming on with all its force and influence, and would proportionably
affect the fubjed, whatever it be, under coniideration.
To enable the reader to find the platic afpeds m
ore readily, I fub-
join the following table ofthe planets orbs, m
eanm

In the foregoing table, at the top of the third column, note thedbfrcha-
radlers of the afperis, fextile * , quartile □, trine a , andoppoiition 8 ,
a
? placed over the figns of the zodiac. In the firft column, obferve the
words dexter and finifter; and in the fecond column, the fign Aries nr.
Thefc are intended to fhew, that aplanet, pofited in v, would fend his
Textile afpedt, dexter to Aquaries, and finifter toGemini; his quartile,
dexter to Capricorn, and iinifter to Cancer; his trine, dexter to’Sagittary,
and finifter to Leo; and would be in oppoiition to a planet pofited in
equal degrees of Libra. The fam
e rules apply throughout thetable; but
it m
uft not beforgotten, that finifterafpeftsgo in the lam
eorder with the
figns of the zodiac, and dexter contrarywiie; and that the dexter^aipects
are m
ore ftrong and powerful than the finifter. And thus, according to
the operations of (he planets and ftars, are the natures of all m
en, as the
planets have predom
inancy in them; andfuch are the natures of all m
an­
ner of herbs an
d plants that grow in the field. Som
e are influenced by
Saturn, and thence are cold an
d dry; others by Jupiter, and thence are
hot an
d moift; one by a
n order of M
ars draw
s nothing but poifon to its
roots, an
d another bv the fweet influence of Venus fucks nothing but the
Tw
eet T
a
p of the earth into all its fibres. If Saturn or M
ars rife with a
birth, it is ten to onebut the child dies that year, unlefs Jupiter or Venus
interpofe, by throwing their friendly influences ftrongly into the fign.
And inthefe refjpects we have as inconteftible proofs of the truth of what
we advance a
s the phyfician has of the natuic of herbs when he taftes
them; he, fromthat dem
onftration, declares them to be hot or cold, and
good cither to cure or kill; but we can afeertain this without tailing
them
, becaufe we know the fource from whence they derive thefe oppo-
T
ite qualities.
It w
ere needlefs for m
e to dwell longer upon an explanation of the
different virtues and effects of the planets and figns. Sufficient has now
been faid, to point out their operations and natural influences to the
underftanding of the moil lim
ited capacity. It therefore only rem
ains
for m
y readers, or fuch of thema
s intend to m
ake any progrefs in the
fludy, to fam
iliarife them
felves with the fubject by a frequent perufal of
it; an
d particularly to acquire a correct knowledge of all the charac­
ters by which the figns, planets, an
d afpects, arefeverally diflinguifhed.
It will then be proper to underftand the following term
s peculiar to
this Art.

D
IRECTION fignifies a planet moving on in its natural courte,
fromweft to eaft, according to the fucceifion of the iigns in the
zodiac ; thus, aplanet is dire.*i, when it m
oves in confequgiuia* from
Aries to Taurus, from Taurus to Gemini, &c. Direction is alio a c-il-
fu lu s l whereby to find the tim
e of any accident or rem
arkable event that
will happen to the perfon who propounds a qùëftiorï, or has his nativity
caft. For inftance, a perfon enquires how m
any years he m
ay live, by
the courfe of the planets at the time of birth ? Having eftabliflied the
Sun, Moon, or afeendant, a
sfignificators„QfJife, and M
ars oxJSaturn a
s
pfom
ittors or portentors of death, the direction is acalculation of the
length of tim
ein which the fignificator will be in m
eeting the prom
ittor ;
and this refolves the queftion. In thefe calculations, the fignificator is
fom
etim
es term
ed apheta, or giver of life, andthe prom
ittor anareta#or
giver of death. The directions of all the principal points of the heavens,
planets, and fixedftars, as the afeendant, m
id-heaven, Sun, Moon, and
part offortune, are worked by the fam
e rule.
S t a t i o n a r y is underftood ofaplanet, when, to the eye or fenfes o f
a beholder here on earth, it appears to ftandftill, without any progreflive
m
otion in itsorbit. Not that a planet ever is or can be naturally inthis
ftate, but is only rendered fo in appearance, by the inequalities which
arife from the pofitions and m
otions of the earth; for, were the planets
to be viewed from the Sun,~or centre of the fyftera, they would always
appear uniform and regular.
R é t r o g r a d a t io n implies an apparent m
otion in the planets,
whereby they feem to go backwards in the ecliptic, and to m
ove in ante-
cedentia, or tow
ards theantecedent Iigns, viz. fromeaft to weft, contrary
to the order of direction and to the fucceflion of the iigns of the zodiac.
This alfo is anappearance produced by an oppofite m
otion of the earth to
that of theplanets.
A p p l ic a t io n fignifies the approach of two planets together, either
by conjunctionorafpect, and is of three kinds : the firft is, whenapla­
net, fwift inm
otion, applies to oneof flower progrefs; forexam
ple, fup-
pofe Mercury pofited in fixteendegrees of Gemini, and M
ars in twenty-
one degreesof the fam
e fign, both being direct in m
otion; Mercury, by
having the greaterapparent projectile force, would overtake andforma

conjunction with M
ars, which is term
ed adireÏÏ application. The fé­
cond kind is form
ed by two retrograde planets ; as, fuppofing Mercury
in fixtecn degrees of Gemini, an
d Saturn in fifteen degrees of the fam
e
fign, both retrograde, Mercury, being the lighter planet, applies to the
body of Saturn, a m
ore ponderous planet, by rétrogradation ; an
dthis is
term
ed a retrograde application. The third kind is occaiioncd by one
planet going directin'Thofion, and m
eeting another planet that is retro­
grade; for inftancc, fuppofe Mercury retrograde in fixteen degrees of
Gemini, and Saturn direct in twelve degrees of the fam
e fign ; here
Mercury, being thelighter planet, applies to a conjunction of Saturn by
a retrograde m
otion ; and thefe two lait aredeem
ed evil applications. It
m
ull alfo be obferved that the fuperior planets never apply to the inferior
but by a retrograde m
otion ; w
hereas the inferior planets apply bptfi ways.
S e p a r a t i o n is underilood of two planets that have either been in
partile conjunction or afpect, and are juft departed or feparated from
it. Thus, if w
e fuppofe Saturn in twelve degrees of Sagittary, andJu­
piter in thirteen degrees of the fam
e fign, Jupiter will be then feparated
one degree from a perfeCl or partile conjunction with Saturn; but they
would ftill be in a platic conjunction, becaufe they arewithin the moiety
of each others radiations, which is four degaees an
d ahalf each, confc-
quently thele planets would continue in platic conjunction until they
w
ere feparated nine degrees, and then the alpect would entirely ceafe.
The exact knowledge of every degree of the reparations of thefe afpects
is of the utm
oft coniequcnce in giving judgment upon various im
por­
tant occafions. For inltance, fuppofe it w
ere dem
anded whether acer­
tain treaty of m
arriage would take place, or not ? When all the afpects
arecollected upon the horofeope, an
d the two planets, that.are fignifica-
tors of the parties, are found applying to each other in a conjunction,
and incom
m
on or fixed figns, the m
arriage m
ay probably take place in
fom
c length of tim
e. If the fignificators are pofited in m
oveable figns,
angular, and approaching fwift in m
otion to aconjunction, it may'then
be confum
m
ated ina very fhort tim
e ; but, if thefignificators are fepara­
ted from aconjunction only a few m
inutes of a degree, one’m
ay Tafely
conclude that there h
as been great probability, only a few days before,
that the weddingwould have taken place; but by this afpect the parties
appear to be hangingjn^ fufpence, and fom
e diilike or change ol ienti-
m
ent feem
s to have taken place : and, as the fignificators gradually fepa-
rate fromthe partile and platic conjunctions, in the fam
e giadation will
the treaty and affections of the parties alienate an
d w
ear aw
ay ; and, by
the com
parative tim
e that theafpect will occupy before it entirely ceafes,
fo will the tim
e be fo m
any weeks, m
onths, or years, before the parties
(hall wholly relinquish the connection.

T rAxsta t i o n of Light and Nature, This happens when a light
planet feparatcs from a weighty one, an
djoins with another m
ore pon­
derous, and is eftefted in this m
anner : let Saturn be placed in twenty
degrees of Aries, Jupiter in thirteen degrees, and M
ars in fourteen de­
grees of the lam
e lign ; here M
ars feparatcs fromaconjunction with Ju­
piter, an
d tran
slates the light andnature of that planet toSaturn, to whom
he nextapplies. The effect of this in practice will be, that, if a m
atter or
thing be prom
ifed by Saturn, then whoever w
as reprefented by M
ars
fhall procure all the affiftance that the benevolent planet Jupiter could
heftow, and tranflate it to Saturn, whereby the buiinefs in hand would be
the better effected, and m
ore happily concluded ; and this, being a very
fortunate pofition of the planets, is very proper to be known, fince it pro-
m
ifes m
uch in lawfuits, m
arriages, and all other queftions of the kind.
R eception is when two planets, that are fignificators inanyqueftion
or nativity, arepoiited in each other’s dignity, a
s the Sun in Aries, and
M
ars in Leo, which is a reception by houfes, and is deem
ed the moil
powerful andefficacious of all receptions. But reception m
ay be by ex­
change oftriplicity, term
, orphafe, orby anyeifentiardignity ; a
s Venus
in Aries, and the Sun in Taurus, is areception by triplicity, if the quef­
tion or nativity happen by day. Or if Venus“be in the twenty-fourth
degree of Aries, and M
ars in the iixteenth degree of Gemini, it is a re­
ception by term
s. The ufc of thefe poiitions in practice is coniiderable ;
for, fuppoie the event of any queilion required be denied by the afpefts,
or the fignificators are in no afpe& with each other; or it is doubtful
what m
ay happen from a quartile oroppofition of the fignificators; yet,
if the principal fignificators are found in m
utual reception, the thing
defired will ihortly com
e to pafs, and probably to the fatisfa&ion and
content of all theparties concerned.
P e r e g r i n a t i o n deferibes a planet to be fituated in a fign, or in
iiich certain degrees of a fign, where it has no effential dignity, either
by houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term
, or phafe; a
s Saturn in the tenth
degree of_Aries, is peregrine; and the Sun, in any part of Cancer, is
peregrine, having no dignity whatever inTthat fign. Inall queftions of
theft, it is very m
aterial to know the peregrine planet; for it has been
uniformly found, by alm
oft every regular profeiTor of this Art, that the
thief m
ay be alm
oft conftantly dilcovercd by the peregrineplanet pofited
inin angle, or in the fccond houfe. "

s if the Sun w
ere in
fifteen degrees thirty m
inutes of Taurus, an
dMercury in fifteen degrees
twenty m
inutes of the fam
e fign, Mercury would be then in cazimi, or
in the heart of the Sun. All authors agree that aplanet in cazim
i is for­
tified thereby, an
dis ofgreater efficacy ; w
hereas a planet in com
buition
is ofam
alignant nature. If the fignificator of a querent, or perfon pro­
pounding aqueftion, be com
buft, it (hew
s him or her to beunder fearful
apprehenG
ons, and threatened to be over-powered, or greatly injured by
fom
e fuperior perfon. It fhould be carefully obferved, that all planets
m
ay b
eincom
buition with theSun, but the Sun cannot be in coinbuftion
with any planet; and that com
buition canonly be by pcrfonal conjunc­
tion in onefign, and not byany afpedt, either Textile, quartile, trine, or
oppofition ; the Sun's quartileoroppofite afpedtsareafflicting, but theydo
not com
bure, or render the planet combuit. A planet is always confi-
dered under the fun-beam
s, until he is elongatedfeventeen degrees before
or after his body.
Void of Course, is when a planet is feparated fromanother planet,
and does not, during its continuancein that fign, fprm anafpect with any
other. This m
oft ufually happens with the Moon; and in practice, it is
obferved, that if the fignificator of the thing propounded be void of
courfe, the bufinefs undercontem
plationwill notlucceed, nor be attended
with any fatisfactory or pleafing confequences.
Besieging, fignifies a planet fituated betwixt the twom

Longitude and Latitu d e. The longitude of any ftar or planet,
is the degree of theeclipticor zodiac inwhich they a
refound, num
bered
fromthe firft point ofthe fign Aries. The latitude of a ftar, or planet,
is its diftance north or fouth fromthe Sun’s path or ecliptic line, num
­
bered by thedegrees of the m
eridian.
Declination, is the diftance a planet fwerves either north or fouth,
from the equator or equinoctial line, in his circuit through the twelve
figns of the zodiac.
R ight Ascent ion, is the num
ber of degrees and m
inutes of the
equinoctial line, reckoned fromthe beginning of Aries, and com

ecliptic.
Oblique A scension, is the degree an

inute of the cquino&ial
line, that com

com
esto the horizon with any ftar or planet inan oblique fphere.

Oblique Descention, is the degree of the equino<ftial line that fets
in the horizon, with the degree of longitude of any ftar or planet, in an
oblique fphere; making any oblique angle with the horizon.
A scentional Difference, is the diftin&ion between the right and
oblique afeenfion of any planet or ftar, reckoned in the equator.
Pole of Position, fignifies the elevation of the poles of the world
above the circle of pofition of any ftar or planet.
C ircles of Position, are circles paffing through the common in-
terfeftions of the horizon and meridian, and through any degree of the
ecliptic, or the centre of any ftar, or other point in the heavens, and arc
ufed for finding the fituation or pofition of any ftar or planet.
H oroscope, is a figure or fcheme of the twelve houfes of heaven,
wherein the planets and pofitions of the heavens are collefted for any
given time, either for the purpofe of calculating nativities, or anfwering
horary queftions. It alfo ngnifies the degree or point of the heavens rif-
ing above the eaftern point of the horizon, at any given time when a
prediftion is to be made of any future event; but this is now moft com­
monly diftinguiilied by the name of the Afcendant.
C olours. The colours given by, or peculiar to, each of the planets
an
d figns, is of great im
portance in the determ
ination of all queftions
where the com
plexion of a perfon, or the colour of a thing is neceffary
to be known. The readerm
uft therefore be careful to rem
em
ber, that of
the planets, Saturn gives a black colour ; Jupiter red m
ixed withgreen;
M
ars, a red fiery colour ; the Moon, all white fpotted, or light m
ixed
colours ; Venus, white and purple colours ; Mercury, light blue or
azure colour ; the Sun, all yellow colours, or inclined to purple. Of the
twelve figns, Aries gives a white m
ixed with red; Taurus, white
m
ixed with citron; Gemini, white m
ixed with red ; Cancer, green
o
r ruffet; Leo, red or green ; Virgo, black fpeckled with blue; Li­
bra, black ordark crim
fon, orfwarthycolour ; Scorpio, dark brow
n ; Sa-
gittary, yellow, o
r a green fanguine colour ; Capricorn, black or ruf­
fet ; Aquaries, light blue or iky-colour; Pifces, agliftening light co­
lour. Thus, by knowing the colour or complexion attributed to each
of the planets and figns, it is eafy to determ
ine the complexion of the
n
ative, o
r of any perfon or thing enquired after ; for a
s the complexion
o
rcolour of the lord of the afcendant, or the fign, or fignificators are,
th
at reprefent the party, fuch will be their colour or complexion. So if

inable by colours.
And fincc this Art cannot be underftood, nor the work read with any

EXPLANATION of the TWELVE HOUSES of HEAVEN, with
D irections for ere&ing the HOROSCOPE.
H
AVING (hew
n what theeiTential qualities are, which the planets
an
d heavenly m
atter derive from an inherent principle of nature, it
follows that I ihould explain theaccidental qualities they receive by their
different pofitions in the twelve houfes of heaven; for, a
s the heavens
arc perpetually in m
otion, either afcending or defcending, andfince it is
be)ond the reach of hum
an penetration to define whatftaror planet (hall
afcend at the nativity of children yet unborn, fo, in reference to hum
an
ideas, it is purely accidental what dignities the planets ihall acquire* or
what houfes they (hall be pofited in, at the tim
e of birth.
That the reader m
ay form a com
petent idea of what is m
eant by the
twelve houfes of heaven, let u
s fuppofe the whole celeftial globe, or
fphere of heaven, divided into four equal parts by the horizon and m
eri­
dional line, and each of thefe into four quadrants, and each quadrant
into three equal parts, by lines draw
n from points of fe&ions in different
partsof the horizon and m
eridian equirdiltant fromeach other. By this
operation, the whole globe or fphere will be apportioned into twelve
equal parts, which conftitute what w
e call, the twelve houfes o f heaven.
And thefe houfes, a
s obfervation and experience abundantly fhew, m
ake
up that great wheel of nature, w
hereon depends the various fortunes con­
tingent to all fublunary m
atters and things.
In this divifion of the heavens, the firft quadrant isdeferibed by a pa­
rallel line, draw
n from the point of the eaft angle to the fouth, or mid­
heaven ; and contains the twelfth, eleventh, andtenth, houfes, called the
oriental, vernal, m
afeuline, fanguine infant quarter. The fecond qua­
drant is deferibed by afimilarline, runningfromtheexteriorpoint of the
m
idheaven to the point of the w
eftern angle, and contains the ninth,
eighth, and feventh, houfes, called the m
eridian, eftival, feminine,
youthful, choleric quarter. The third quadrant is form
ed by aparallel
line running from the extrem
e point of the eighth houfe to the north
angle ; and contains the fixth, fifth, and fourth, houfes, called the occi­
dental, autum
nal, m
afeuline, m
elancholic, m
anly, cold an
d dry quar­
ter. The fourth quadrant is deferibed by a line draw
nfrom the extrem
e
point of the north angle to the extrem
ity of the line which deicribes
the firii quadrant, both m
eeting in the e
a
ft:angle of the heavens, an

FIGURE of the HOROSCOPE, or T welve Houses of Heaven.
Thefe twelvehoufes areeach diftinguiihed by their refpedtivefigures,
and areeither angular, fuccedent, orcadent. The angular houfes are four,
called the afcendant, m

the bottom of the heaven; thefeare deem

oil

According
O F A S T R O L O G Y . tS7
According to this rule, if we find two planets, equally ftrong and
of the fam
e dignities, one pofited in the firft houfe and the other in the
tenth, wejudge the planet in the firft houfe, or afcendant, to have fupe-
riority over the planet inthe tenth houfe; and, inpractice, we infer, from
fuch apofition, that the perfon, whofe fignificator w
as in the firft houfe
would get the better of his opponent, whofe fignificator w
as in the tenth
houfe; but, both being fo nearly equal in point of dignity, great drug­
gies and difficulties would intervene, as the nature of the cafe in point
m
ay happen to be. This rule holds good from the tenth houfe to the
feventh; the feventh to the fourth, and lb on through the whole ; but
it fhould always be rem
em
bered that planets in angles, that is, thofe
which are feated in theangular houfes, are the mojl forcible and potent
intheir operation.
The firft houfe, which is denoted by the figure 1, is called the afcen­
dant, becaufe, the point of its angle being level with the horizon, what­
ever planet afcends fromunder the earth muftafcend upon this line, and
becom
e vifible firft in this houfe. The line upon which the planets
afcend, or m
ove, is called the cufp of the houfes; and that of the afcen­
dant isgenerally reckoned to extend about five degrees above the earth
an
d twenty-five degrees beneath, ready to afcend. But, if figns of long
afcenfions afcend, then half five degrees above the earth, an
d thirteen bel­
low, are its utm
oft limits. If figns offhort afcenfions afcend, then five
degrees above the horizon, and fifty degrees below, are uftially allowed. .
Now the quality of whatfoever part of theheavens occupies or fills up the
degrees of this houfe, carries along with it the health, life, an
d nature, of
everyinfant or thing that isconceived or brought forth within itsjuridic­
tion. And hence hath this point of theheavens afaculty ofattractingor
receiving the virtues of theceleftial m
atter that is accidentally afeendm
g
inthat part of heaven at the birth ; andalfo of the planets and fixed ftars
in their tranfits ; and all the rays of the planets, in their afpects an
d con­
junctions, areattracted into this part of heaven, in order to theform
ation .
of the fhape, ftature, tem
peratureofthe body, quality ofthem
ind, andall
accidents and contingencieswhich ihalLbefal the native's body, orhealth,
o
r life, unto his dying day ; fuch a fym
JJathy is there betw
een this part *
of th
e heavenly fram
e and of every ad
t and thing that is produced or
that receives life under it. For, a
s
-the feed in the ground, after it has
taken root, buds forth, andappears above groound, fo the heavenly in­
telligencers, after they have fram
ed the em
bryo, and the tem
peram
ent
thereof, underthe earth, give it life and being of its own, putting forth
level w
ith themjuft as they afcend. We do not however fuppole, that
th
etem

d qualities of thenativew
ere wholly fram
ed at theexaCt
time
»5$ A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
time of birth, although the fituation of the heavens at that time never
fails exactly to deicribe them; we have every reafon to believe, that the
tem
perature and qualities of the body, an
d the difpofition of the mind,
are form
ed inregulargradations fromthe conception to the tim
eof birth ;
but that the birth dclcribes them is indifputably clear, becaufe it can­
not happen at any m
om
ent of tim
e, in any part of the world, but it m
uft
fall even with that part of the heavenly m
atter attending from thelower
unto the upper horizon, which is interefted in, and therefore points out,
thole tem
peratures and qualities. For any m
an to be fatisfied in this
point, let him but note what the nature of this afeending point of hea­
ven is, with all the ftars an
d planets pofited therein, or having afpedl
with them from other houfes, giving each of them theirdue weight and
influence, according to their natureand dignity, neither drained oneway
nor the other; and, juft a
s thefe are found at the tim
e of birth, juft fo
fhall be found the qualities and endowm
ents of that native, with the
principal adtions and events of his life, which this point afeending takes
the charge of. And in this trial will the reader find m
ore fubftantial
proofs of the truth and exiftence of Aftiology than the mod acute argu­
m
ents can inftil into his m
ind.
Now, fince the firft houfe, or afeendaqt, gives birthand life to the na­
tive, it follows that thofe houfes which are the attendants on and up­
holders of life, ihould bejoined with it; and, a
s children, or the native’s
offspring, are the upholders of life in this world, and religion and learn­
ing the grand m
eans of upholding it unto eternity in the other world, fo
thehoules, which contribute thefe blefiings to the life already given, are
joined in an harm
onious trine with the firft houfe, making up that three­
fold cord, which, as Solom
on faith, can never be broken; the one is a
fuccedent houfe, called the fifth houfe, and the other a cadent houfe,
called the ninth houfe; and, to be convinced of the effects of this fifth
houfe, note the heavenly m
atter, planets, ftars, and afpeits therein po­
in
ted at the tim
e of birth, according tothe ruleshere laiddown, and they

The fecond angular point of the houfes of heaven is called the mid­
heaven, which is that point which culm
inates, being the very top or
higheft point of the heavenly fram
e. And, whatever part of the heavens
happens to be culminating in this point at the birth of any perfon or
thing, that takes charge of, and carries along with it, ever after, the pre­
ferm
ent, honour, profeflion, fituation, and authority, of the native ; and,
a
s the nature of the planets, ftars, afpefts, and heavenly m
atter, happens
to be, that are iituated in this point, or in the degrees pertaining to it,
fo fhall the native proveinhis life-time, in pointof dignity, advancem
ent,
and reputation, in this world, whether high or low, fortunate or unfor­
tunate, favouredor difgraced. The attendants upon, and upholders of,
m
an’s honour and dignity, as the Scriptures and every day’s experience
perpetually ihew us, are weahh and fervants. The firft of thele is at­
tached to the m
idheaven in afuccedent hotrie, called the fecond houfeof
heaven; andthe other in acadenthoufe, calledthe fixth houfeof heaven;
and thefe two are fituated in an harm
onious trine with the angular point
of the m
idheaven. And now well obferve what the planets, ftars, aif
spcXs, and heavenly m
atters, are in either of thefe houfes at the tim
e of
birth, and fuch ihall the native’s fortune prove in point of riches and
fubordinate dependants; in the firft of thefe houfes for wealth, and in
the other for iervants or dependants.
The third angle of the figureof heaven is the feventh houfe, or point
of the heavens and degrees contingent, which are always defeending, or
fetting out of our horizon, and finking under the earth; and this point
is dircXly oppofite to the eaftern angleor afeendant. Now, a
s the riling
heaven, or afeendant, is the begianingand conduit of life, fo this^fet-
ting heaven, level with the afeendant, is the bringing all m
undane
affairs level with life, fuch as our entrance into the ft3fe"oY marriage;
our contraXs and enterprifes in bufinefs, war, and travel; and our con­
nexions and fuccefs therein, whether with friends, ftrangers. orenemies;
an
d thefe w
'hether honeft m
en, parafites, or thieves. And the heavenly
m
atter, planets, ftars, andafpeXs, fituated in this angleat a nativity, appa­
rently fhew how a m
an ihall fare in refpeX to wives, m
oreorlefs, anyor
none, good or bad ; and, in m
atters of bufinefs or adventure, howfortu­
nate or unfortunate he m
ay be likely to prove; and, withenem
ies or
thieves, howfar he is likely to be injured by them
. Neceffaiy upholders
of m
arriage, fupporters in trade and travel, and defenders againft thieves,
plunderers, and enem
ies, are friends, relations, and neighbours. And
thefe, inatrine to the feventhhoule,~ar’
ebrought Forth, the firft out of
the eleventh houfe of heaven a fuccedent houfe, and the other out of the
third houfe of heaven, a cadent houfe. The eleventh houfe, by the pla-
-No. 8. N n nets,
i6o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
nets, ftars, afpedls, and heavenly m
atter, therein, points out the ftate of
a m
an’s friends and hopes in this life; and the third houfe defcribes, by
the fam
e m
eans, how happy or unhappy a m
an £
h
all prove in his rela­
tions, connections, and neighbours.
The lad angle of heaven is the fourth houfe, called the bottom of
heaven, and reprefcnts that point which lirour conception feecn
s tirtratig
at the very bottomof the round ball of the celeftial world, being diam
e­
trically oppofjte to the exterior, orjnidheaven. And, as that ihews what
a m
an in the courfeof nature ihall rife to in the world, this, on the con­
trary, declares what and w
hen ihall be his fall, decay, and death. This
houfe has therefore fignification of the end of every worldly concern,
and, am
ongftother ends, of the grave, which is the end of all m
en liv­
ing, however dignifiedor great. And the planets, ftars, and afpefts, po«
fited in this houfe at the tim
e of birth, never fail to ihew what kind of
end the native is likely to find; for, as the twelve figns have each their
.particular and vifible effefts upon and over every part of m
an’s body, and
as the planets and their afpects ihew in what fign the native ihall be im-
pedited, that is, in what part of the body the root of hisnatural infirmity
ihall be placed, and what accidents ihall befal him during life, fo is it
an eafy procefs to point out the m
annerof his death, and whethernatural,
honourable, or ignominious. The upholdersof this angle arethe houfes
of tribulation anddeath; the one a lucccdent houfe, called the eighth
houfe, or houfe of death ; and the otheracadent houfe, called the twelfth
houfe. And nowlet it be carefully obferved what planets, ilars, afpeCts,
and heavenly m
atter, occupy thofe houfes at the time of nativity ; and
they ihall point out, in the twelfth houfe, all the principal m
isfortunes,
afflictions, and tribulations, of thenative’s life, and in the eighth houfe
the tim
e and m
anner of his death.
Independent of the faculties hitherto fpecified, each of thefe houfes of
heaven haveother fignifications and effects, which they dem
onffrate in
various other ways. For inftance, the afeendantreprefents the native
coming intothe. world, an
d the fourth houfe at the fam
e time repre­
fents the parents of the nativegoing out j for one generation goes off, and
another always comes in-{-, according to the courfe of nature. Of thefe
parents, the father is m
ore efpecially fignified by the fourth houfe;
and then, fecondarily, but not foforcibly, the m
otherof thenative isfig­
nified by the tenth houfe, and the grandfather by thefeventh; anduncles,
aunts, andrelations, on thefather’s fide, by the fixth; and uncles, aunts,
t See Ecclcf. i. 4. -
and
O F A S T R O L O G Y . l6i
and relations, on the m
other’s fide, by the twelfth« Hence alfoit com
es
to pafs, that by the fourth houfearefignifiedhoufes andlands, andall de­
grees of patrim
ony, left by the father; and by the eighth houfeare ihcwn
all goods and legacies left by will of the deceafed. The fecond and fixth
houfes in half-trine tothe houfeof the grave, and in oppolitibn to the
eighth andtwelfth, have afecondary fignification of iicknefs and death.
Such are the qualities andoperations of the twelve houfes of heaven
in the com
m
on courfe of nature; but thefe qualities af t fom
etim
es m
a­
terially altered, and changed for the better or worfe, by m
eans either of
the m
oon or fom
e other of the celeftial m
otions oraffediions. It is cer­
tain that the Moon circleththeearth once inevery twenty-eight days; but
inthis peram
bulation ihe neither keepsthe Sun’s pathway in the ecliptic,
nor continues her courfe conftantly on the fam
e fide of it; but once in
every fourteen days ihe crofles the ecliptic, alternately to her north and
fouth declination; and it is found by long and corredt obfervation, that
the point in the heavens where ihe crofles this line is very ftrongly af-
fedted by her m
otion. The Moon is the great body of life and growth ;
and, when ihe paflcs theecliptic to the north, which brings her nearer
into this northern world, ihe thengives an extraordinary degree ofjruit-
fulnefs, which wonderfully ftrengthens with its influence whatloever
happens within the line of its juriididtion. And this point, wherever it
falls, is called the m
oon’s north node, but is diitinguiihed in aftrological
works by the nam
e of the Dragon’s Head, as already explained in page
125. If this point happens toafcend inanativity, it ftrengthens life with
a rpbuft and lively conftitution ; if it falls in the mid-heaven, it prom
ifes
great honour and preferment; if in the eleventh houfe, profperity and
riches. If Jupiter or Venus happen to be in thefe degrees, it m
akes them
m
uch ftronger and m
ore efficacious in their benevolent operations; bur,
if Saturn or M
ars be poiited there, it gives them, on the contrary, a
ftronger inclination to prove mifehievous and unfortunate. When the
m
oon interfedls the ecliptic line to her fouthern declination, ihe leaves
that point of the heavens where fhe crofles it, which is term
edtheJDrag*
on’s Tail, as barren to all intents and*purpofes as the other w
as fruitful.
Hence this point afeending at a nativity blemiihes-life, and leaves a ftain
upon it; im
pairs honour andadvancem
ent inthe m
id-heaven, and waftes
riches, and brings adverfity, intheeleventh houfe ; an
d it w
eakens aswell
the benevolent aufpices ofJupiter and Venus as the evil inclinations of
Saturn and Mars. How thefe circum
ftances operatebeyondtheequinoc­
tial experience is yet filent; but it feem
s reafonable to fuppofe that the
Dragon’s Tail is there the fruitful point, and the H
ead the barren point,
fince, when the Moonis going offfromus, her influences mult becoming
on with them
.
Next
l 6 2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
Next to the nodes, the part o f fortune has its operations upon thefe
twelve celeftial houfes. The point, which we term the part of fortune,
is the diftancc of the Moon’s place fromthe Sun’s, added to the degreesi
of the afcendant; and the nature of it is, a
s conftant obfervation aficer-J
t^ins, that, if this point falls am
ong fortunate ftars, orin afortunate parr
of the heavens, then it prom
ifes great fuccefs in health or wealth, honour
or offspring, or anyother fpecies of profperitv, according a
s it isTeated
either in the firft, eleventh, or fifth, houfes, or in any others. The rea-
fon of this appears^to be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being the
prim
e conduits through which the itreamof life flows, this feat of the
part of fortune is the harm
ony of all three concentring and uniting in
the fam
e ads of benevolence.
Now, befides thefe, there are yet other qualities, accidentally affefied,
which concern either particular perfons or tim
es. Thus, the places of
Saturn, or M
ars, orthe Tail of the Dragon, in the vernal figure, are un­
fortunate inthe higheft degree for the whole of that year; or, if they
happen in any of the quarter figures, they portend affliction and mif*
fortune for that quarter. But the places of Jupiter and Venus in a ver­
nal figure are a
s fortunate a
s the others areunfortunate for thefam
etime.
The places of an eclipl'eof the Sunor Moon, an
d of thecomets, arc alfo
fortunate o
r unfortunate, as their iituation m
ay be, or a
s perfons, coun­
tries, or ftates, m
ay be concerned in them
. The place of Saturnor M
ars
in a m
an’s nativity proves unfortunate to him all thedays of his life; and
the place of citherof them in a revolutional figure isequally bad for that
year. But the placeof Jupiter or Venus in a nativity, or in a revolu- ,
tional figure, is always a
s fortunate, either for a m
an’s life-time, or for
the year, as the other is unfortunate. Alfo the places of the twelfth
houie, oreighth, or fixth, a
s they w
ereinthe nativefchem
e, have always
bad fignifications unto am
an, whenfoever they com
e up upon any of his
concerns. And the places of the tenth.houie, of the eleventh, of the
afcendant, and of the fecond boufe, generally prom
ife as m
uch good as
the other houfes do evil upon all thecom
m
on occafions of life.
Thus far we have feen the operations of the twelve houfes of heaven,
a
s they appertain tothe tim
e andcircum
flances of a nativity. We ihaH
now explain their properties in that fyflem of nature upon which the
dodtrineof horary queftions is grounded. And fuch has been the induf-
dryand indefatigable labour of our forefathers, in bringing this Science to
m
aturity, andindifeovering anddiftinguifliing the particularilgniiications
and effedts ofall pofitions of theplanetsin thefe twelvehoufes of heaven,

By the eleventh houfe we anfwerall enquiries concerning friends and

power. The co-fignificators of this houfe are the Sun and Aquaries $
and its colour is either faffron or deep yellow.
The twelfth houfe, being the houfeof contribution, refolves all queilions
of forrow, affliction, anxiety of mind, trouble, diftrefs, imprisonment,

O F A S T R O L O G Y . ,67
perfecution, malice, fecret enemies, filicide, treafon, confpiracy, aflaf-
fination, and every thing appertaining to the misfortunes and afflictions
of mankind. Its confignificators are Venus and Pifces ; and Saturn
greatly joyeth in this houfe, being the parent of malevolence and malig­
nity. The colour it gives is green.
From the foregoing circumftantial furvey of the twelve houfes of hea­
ven, I truft the reader will be enabled to form fuch an idea of the nature
of predicting by the horofcope, as will enable him not only to proceed to
place the flars and planets therein with corre&nefs and precifion, but alfo
to form an accurate and diftind judgment of their power and influence,
under whatever afpeCts or pofltions he may occaflonally find them ; for,
until he can accompliih this, it will be in vain for him to attempt any
examples in the doftrine of horary queftions or nativities, which will be
the next objeCl of our plan, after explaining the tables for finding the
places of the planets every hour and minute of the day, and directing the
reader how to place them in the horofcope. But I cannot difmifs this
fubjeft, without giving my readers the definition of the twelve houfes of
heaven, from the works of the learned and much-efteemed philofopherand
aftrologian, Morinus ; and in doing this, I fhall adhere as much to the
fpirit and letter of the author as the nature of a tranflation will admit.
" It is a fad, fays this excellent author, which preponderates in the ba­
lance of reafon, and highly claims our fober confederation, that the life of
man is refolvable into four diftind periods or ages 5 namely, infancy,
youth, maturity, and old age; though it may be faid with ftrid truth,
that fcarce half the human race attain to the conclufion of only their third
period. In the conftruclion of man, therefore, we difeover four affedions,
into which all other things appear to be reducible, as it were to their firft
beginning; namely, life, adion, marriage, andpaffion. Thefe agree with
the rife, perfedion, declination, and termination of all things, and com-
prife the whole effeds and operations of nature. For man is truly faid
to rife into the world, the moment he receives refpiration and life; to be
in perfection, when he attains to manhood and maturity, and to the pro­
pagation of his fpecits ; to decline, when he begins to lofe the innate
radical principle of heat and moifture ; and to fuftain the laft paifion of
life, when he ccafes to breathe, and filcntly finks into the grave.. The
life, adion, marriage, and paifions, of men, are therefore governed by the
fame celeftial principle, which regulates the birth, perfection, declinati­
on, and diflolution, of all other things. Wherefore life, in the fyftetn
of nature, is regulated by the eaft angle of the heavens, called the afeen-
dant; action, by the fouth angle, or mid-heaven; marriage, by the weft
angle; andpafflon, by the north angle of the heavenly frame. And hence
No. 8. P p arile
16« A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
arife four triplicities of the fame genus or generical nature, and twelve
houfes, as heretofore defcribed. The firft triplicity is of the eaftern an­
gle, or afcendant, attributed to infancy, and called the triplicity of life,
and includes the firft, ninth, and fifth, boofes, which behold each other
in a partile trine in the equator, where this rational divihon of the twelve
houles is made.
99 Man either does or ought to live in a three-fold refpefi, in himfelf,
in God, and in his pofterity ; for the great ends for which lie was created,
are toworfhip and glorify his Maker, and to propagate his fpecies. Thelife
of man in himfelf is therefore the firft and prime obje£i in the order of
nature ; for without this all other parts of the creation would be vain,
being madefor mans ufe and benefit. For this caufe, the life of man ap­
pertains to the firft and principal houfe in the divifion of the heavens.
But man's life in God, confiding in his image of the Divinity, in the ra­
tionality of his foul, and in the purity of his morals, claims, for this rea-
fon, the ninth houfe, according to the motion of the equator, which is
the houfe of piety and religion. And, as man’s life is continued in his
pofterity, according to one and the fame unchangeable law prefiding over
all nature, fo the houfe of infancy and children, which is the fifth houfe,
is appropriated for this purpofe. And thefe three concerns being con-
fefledly the grand objeft of man’s life, the three houfes of heaven, under
which they are refpettively nourilhedand foftcred, form a trine with each
other, in a chain of mutual harmony and concord.
4t The fecond triplicity confifts of the angle of the mid-heaven, with
the fixth and fecond houfes. This triplicity wholly appertains to the
fecond ftageof man’s life, namely, that of vigour anda&ion; and there­
fore comprehends all worldly attainments, with the advantages flowing
from them ; for every thing that worketh phyfically, worketh for fome
phyfical good ; and, as the motion of the equator is from the eaft angle to
the mid-heaven, fo is the progrefs made in all our earthly acquifitions.
The higheft degree of man’s elevation in this world is to that of majefty,
power, honour, dignity, preferment, or magiftracy, or to any of thofe fi-
tuations by which he acquires fuperiority and affluence. Thefe, confift-
ing of immaterial matter, and forming the firft order of earthly dignity,
claim the angular houfe of this triplicity, or the mid-heaven. The fe­
cond degree of worldly honour is conceived to arife from fubjedls, fer-
vants, tenants, vaffals, and domeftics ; and tbefe, being formed of mat­
ter material and animated, are placed under the fixth houfe. The third
advancement to earthly grandeur is by matter material and animate, fuch
as gold, jewels, and other valuable effects, accumulated by induftry and
fwcat ofthe brow * which being under the fecond houfe, thefe three houfes
are
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 169
are alfo joined by fympathy in a partile trine, applying to each otbej; in
concord and unanimity. '
«
« The third triplicity comprehends worldly connections, whether by
marriage, confanguinity, or friendihip ; and thefe, holding on in the or«
der of nature, even as the progrefs is made from the mid-heaven to the
weitern angle, apply to the progreilive tendency of youth to manhood and
maturity. In this itage of life, man is joined in a three-fold tie or obli­
gation ; in body, in blood, and in friendihip. Firft,bci$jQined in body,
by the moil facred o f all earthly ties, matrimony j faQ&iqQfid under the
feat of God’s primary command, “ increafe and multiply.” Secondly, he
is joined in confanguinity, not only by the propagation of his like, but
by all orders of his kindred in blood. Thirdly, he is joioed in friend­
ihip under that facred bond of benevolence and love, which the Almighty
commands every man to exercife towards his neighbour. This is the
very cement of fociety, and medicine of life, performing thofp good offi­
ces in civil life, which the tree pf life promifed in our more perfect ftate,
and thefe are the fentiments of friendship, which alone can give a true
relifh to every enjoyment of this world. The moft important of thefe
obligations, being marriage, is for that reafon placed under fan&ion of the
angular or fuperior houfe j the fecond tie, being that or blood, claims the
government of the third houfe i and the eleventh houfe, which perfects
this triplicity, is facred to friendihip. Thefe three houfes, from an
union of nature, behold each other in a partile trine, according to the mo­
tion of the equator.
“ The fourth and laft triplicity is that of paffion, which comprehends
the three clades of human afflictions. The firft, or angular houfe of this
triplicity, in allulion to its portion in the lower horizon, is termed the
dark angle, the depth of night, and bottom of heaven t the den and cave
of the ftars and planets. To this houfe is committed the firft order of our
woes, agreeable to the courfe of nature : thefe are, infupportable mis­
fortunes, and vihble decline of lifej the firil confequences of original
fin, by which man is devoted to corruption and decay, and to all the infir­
mities of nature. The fecond order of human afflictions is tribulation,
forrow, and difeafe ariling either from the treachery and perfection of
enemies, from the chains of fervitude and bondage, or from poverty and
want: thefe, with a long train of confequent naileries, are appropriated to
the twelfth houfe. The laft fhock that can be luftained by human na­
ture, is death, the final end of all men: this is under government of
the eighth houfe, termed, on this account, the houfe of death. And
thefe houfes likewife, from the conformity of thetr nature and qualities,
conftitute a partile trine in the equator.
** Thus
i;o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
4
' “ Thus the termination of this temporal life is the beginning of life
eternal. For nature knows no annihilation. All the works of Omnipo­
tence are refolvable or changeable from one ftate to another j but God,
having created nothing in vain, fuffers nothing :o be annulled. Where­
fore, according to the fecond motion of the planets, which is from weft to
eaft,‘an entrance is made out of the eighth into the ninth houfe, which
is the houfe of life in God, wherein nun is taught, by the revelation of
the SUPREM E W ILL, that he ihall pafs, by the fecond motion of the
foul, which i$ attributed to the mind or reafon, (as the firft or wrapt foul
or feniitive appetite is to the body,) from this life of anxiety and peril,
to an eternal life of peace and reft. And therefore, whatever is ñrft in
dignity in the order of nature, pofiefies the firft and more noble houfesin
thefe triplicities, in regular fubordination, according to the motion of the
ecliptic and planets.
** And now, what man is he, who, confiding in the ftrength of his
own wifdom, will dare to meafure the works of his C R E A T O R by the
ftandard of his own comprehenfion ? or will venture to affirm, that thefe
operations and divifions of the twelve celeftial houfes, conjoined with
fuch wonderful harmony, contrivance, and concord, are the efteds of
chance or accident; or that will fay, fuch admirable confents, foexcellently
formed, and mutually dependant on each other, are cafually found in
things fo complicated and abftrufe ? If he obftinately perfifts that thefe
are altogether fiétious, let him point out the thing wanting to complete
the evidence in fupport of the natural foundation and excellency of them ?
But he can do neither; and therefore, as this divifion of the heavens is
founded in reafon, and obvioufly contrived by fupernatural wifdom and
prefcience, it comprehends genethliacally all things that in the courfe of
nature can poifibly be enquired of or concerning the works of man.
For as much as the knowledge of contrarieties is univerfally the fame, fo
an affirmative, or a negative, may be fought out, and found to be com-
prifed in the twelve houfes of the zodiac anfwering to the divifion.”

D IRECTION S for erefling the FIGURE of H EAVEN , and placing
the P LA N E T S in the H OROSCOPE.
W
IT H O U T being expert at finding the true places of the planets
and ftars, at any hour or minute required, either by day or night;
and without knowing how to difpofe them in the horofeope, fo as to re­
prefent their exact iituations in the heavens ; nothing can poffiWy be
known or predicted by Aftrology. This acquifition, therefore, is the
next ftep to be attained ; and, though it mayatfirft appear a talk of fome
difficulty and labour, yet, by the help of a common Ephemeris, which is
publiihed annually, and the following tables, which are calculated and
fubjoined for this purpofe, the reader may in a few hours become perfect
mailer of this very effential part of the fcience.
The Ephemeris, of which Mr. White’s is the beft, is calculated to
ihew the exact places of the Sun, Moon, and planets, every day at twelve
o’clock ; confequently, by referring to it, a figure may be accurately fet
to that exact time. But it may feldom or ever happen, that a figure is
wanted precifely at that hour, and therefore it is neceffary the young prac­
titioner ihould know how to rectify the daily motions of the planets, by
the number of degrees they move every twenty-four hours, fo as to erect
the figure, and introduce the true places of the figns and planets, when­
ever required. This, by referring to the Ephemeris for the ilations of
the planets at noon, may be done extremely eafy, by the common pro-
cefs of figures ; but, that every reader may be enabled to do it without
trouble, } have fubjoined an eafy table, whereby the planetary motions
are reduced to hours and minutes, and may be found for either day or
night.
It is likewife of importance to know the planetary hours, that is, the
hour in which every planet has its particular rule $ for hereby we are
enabled to determine various points, and to draw many ufeful conclu-*
fions, either in our judgment on nativities or horary queftions. In ga­
thering herbs for medicinal purpofes,' the planetary hour is certainly
of confequence, however modern refinement might have exploded
•the idea. In nature, the moil fimple remedies are frequently found to
produce the moil falutary effects ; and in earlier times, when the art of
phyfic was lefs obfeured, and practifed more from motives of benevo­
lence, the world was lefs afflicted with difeafe, and the period of hu­
man life lefs contracted. The fupreme Being, in his abundant mercies
to mankind, has furnifhed ample remedies in the laboratory of nature,
were nature but adhered to, for the removal of every curable diforder in­
No. 9. Qj 3 cident
172 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
cident to the human frame ; for» notwithftanding all the parade of com*
pound medicines, the art of phyfic does not confift fo much in preparing
the remedy, as in knowing how to apply it. Hence it happens that old

O F A S T R O L O G Y .
To underftand the preceding table, the reader maft recoiled that we
have already aifigned to each planet his refpedive rule over every day in
the week; for inftance, the Sun governs Sunday, the Moon Monday,
Mars Tuefday, Mercury Wednefday, Jupiter Thurfday, Venus Friday,
and Saturn Saturday. Each planet begins his rule the moment the Sun
appears above the horizon, and continues for one planetary hour* at the
expiration of which the nextplanet in order commences his rule, and con-
tinuesthe fame portion of time, and then the third planet in order governs,
and fo on through the whole week. So that, if I wanttoknow what planet
rules in any particular hourof the day or night, I take the planet which be­
gins rule that day, and reckon in order till I find it. For example On Sun­
day the Sun rules the firft hour, Venus the fecond, Mercury the third, the
Moon the fourth, Saturn the fifth, Jupiter the fixth, Mars the l'eventh,
the Sun the eighth, Venus the ninth, and fo on through the whole day
and fucceeding night, till the Sun rifes again ; by which mode of reckon­
ing it will be uniformly found, that each planet will begin his govern­
ment at Sun rifing, according to the order above deferibed, to the end
of the world. This alfo evidently appears by the table: for, if we begin
with the firft column, and reckon down the whole twenty-four hours,
we find the Moon begins hisgovernment at the top of the fecond column
on Monday morning, when the fun riles. If we reckon down the fecond
column, in the fame order, we find Mars begins his rule at the top of
the third column, on Tuefday morning. So the planets will be found
to obferve the fame regular order throughout all the other columns,
which take in the hours of every day and night throughout the week j
and for the enfuing week the table begins again in the fame order, and
will fo continue without alteration or error, to the end of time. By re­
ferring to the figures, which reprefent the refpedtive hour of every day

vegetableandmineral worlds, areftrong arguments of the neceflity of regular Pra£llcf> a"d

confulta little more the planetary influences, both on vegetable and mineral fubflances, and
apportion themin their preferiptions according to the nature and conftitution of the patient*

ilous accidents of the unfortunate, would gammuch improvement

the author means to arraign; but that baneful defcription of empirics and
row pervade the kingdom ; and, like a fwarm of locufts from the call, prey
Pc of mankind. Thefe monfters in the fhape of men, with hearts callous to every
compaffion, have only fees in view. Governed by this fordid principle, they

and night throughout the week, the reader may always fee what planet
governs in that hour, as its character is placed in the lame line with the
figure. For example, fuppofe I want to know what planet rules the
fifth hour on Sunday morning; I look down the firll colum of the
table, over which is placed Sunday planetary hour, and at the 5th hour
I find Saturn governs. Again, fuppofe it be required to know what pla­
net governs the ninth hour on Friday afternoon : Look down the column
over which Friday planetary hour is printed, and in the 9th hour it will
be feen that Mercury governs. Or if it beaiked, what planet rules the
nineteenth hour on Wednefday night ? Look down the column over which
Wednefday planetary hour is prefixed, and at 19, which fignifies the
19th hour, or the feventh hour after the Sun is fet, it will be found that
Mars governs ; and fo for any other time required.
But a planetary hour not agreeing with the common divifion of time,
and being peculiar to aftronomy and aftrology only, we (hall explain it
more fully. The planetary hours are reckoned from the time of the Sun’s
rifing to its fetting, which fpace of time is divided into twelve equal parts,
and thefe are termed the twelve planetary hours of that day. Then the
time from the Sun’s fetting to its rifing the next morning, is in the fame
manner divided into twelve equal parts, and thefe conftitutc the twelve
planetary hours for that night. Hence it is obvious, that when the
days are ihort, a planetary hour does not conliftof above forty minutes,
more or lcfs, according to the twelfth part of the whole time from the
Sun’s rifing to its fetting j and the nights being then long, a planetary
hour by night may confift of an hour and ten or twenty minutes, or more $
and fo vice verfa, when the days are long, and the nights ihort, fo that the
duration of planetary hours, both by day and night, are continually varying,
and never agree with the common meafure of time, except on thofe two
days in every year when the Sun enters Aries and Libra, and then equal
night and day are difpenfed to allparts of the world. Therefore, to enable
the reader to find the length of the planetary hours without the trouble
of calculating, I fubjoin the following table, by which they may be found
both night and day for ever.

third column ftand fifty-two minutes thirty feconds, which is the length

planetary hours may be eafily found in this table every day and night
through the year. The length of time between the rifing and fetting of
the Sun may always be found in the Ephemeris. This table is calcu­
lated within thirty-minutes of the Sun’s real time every day, which is

Tofind the true place ofeachplanet, at any hourw
hen wehaveocca-
fion to ereft a figure, it only requires to turn to the Ephemeris for the pla­
nets’ places at noon j thofe being found, note how many degrees or mi­
nutes they move in the zodiac by twelve o’clock the next day, or from
noon the preceding day j and then, by the help of the foregoing table, it
will be feen how many degrees, minutes, or feconds, they move in an
hour For example, fuppofe a planet moves one degree in twenty-four
Hours how far does it move in one hour ? At the top of the firft column
* the’fieure l and in the fame line of the fecond column is 2 minutes
fnd ao feconds; which ihews, that, if a planet be twenty-four hours in
* v jL one degree, it then moves at the rate of two minutes and thirty
fecond! in an hour. Or fuppofe a planet only moves two minutes m
.--four hours ; look into the firft column of the table tor the figure 2,
' in tnc fecond column, (land 5 feconds, which (hews that, if a
nlinet moves two minutes in twentv-four hours, it then only moves five
feconds in an hour. Again, if a planet’s diurnal motion be thirteen mi­
nutes what is its hourly motion ? Look into the farft column for 13,
twenty
oppofite
•ly motion ? Look into the firft column for 13,
and oppofite is 32, 30; which indicates, that, if a planet moves thirteen
mirni csin twenty-tour hours, it moves tlnrty-two feconds and thirty
thirds in -an hour? 1 he fame rules hold good for the motions of a 1 the
nlanets • it mull however be carefully obferved, that, if the diurnal mo-
L n of any planet be in degrees, then you muft enter the firft column of
the table under the denomination of degrees, and the fecond column
with minutes and feconds 5 but, if the diurnal motion of the planet be
only in minutes, then you muft begin to reckon in thehrft column only
with minutes, and in the fecond column with leconds and thirds.
This is indicated by the initial letters placed over each column, which
fi<nify degrees or minutes in the firft column, and, in the fecond degrees
and minures, minutes and feconds, feconds and thirds. Then, fuppofe a
planet moves one degree and thirteen minutes ,n twenty-four hours, how
far does it move in an hour ? Refer to the table, and lay,
One degree in 24hours is 2min. 30 fee. o thirds per hour.
Thirteen min. in 24 hours is o min. 32 fee. 30 thirds.
Anfwer 3 . 2 30
And thus any quantity of a planet’s diurnal motion may be reduced to
time in the fame manner. .

It is no uncommon thing with many readers, and particularly thofe
not very converlant with figures, to pais over all tables as intricate, or
difficult to underftand. But, fince no information can be obtained in the
practical part of this fcience without them, it is proper to caution all my
readers againft this much-miftaken notion ; for every perfonwhocan make
ufe of a Ready Reckoner, or Trader s Sure Guide%may with equal cafe un-
derihnd all the tables calculated for this work.
The ufe of the Ephemeris, in fetting afigure, is to point out the places
of the planets at noon, whenever required. For this purpofe, we refer
to the given day of the month, in the firil column of the right-hand page,
and oppofite to it, in the ilcond column, is the Sun’s place or longitude
that day ct noon. So alio, in the lame line of the fucceeding columns
through the whole table, are the places of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as fpecified at the top of tach diftinCi co­
lumn ; and rhefe are the true places of the Sun, Moon, and planets,
every day throughout the year, precifely at twelve o’clock at noon.
Thereiore, if the figure be erected before that time, the diurnal motion
of the planets muft be deducted in hours and minutes, in proportion to
the rate they move at per hour; but, if it be ere‘ted alter i oun, then fo
many hours or minutes muft be added as will bring them to the precife
time of erecting the figure.
The twelve tables ofHoufes are next to be referred to } and thefe are
calculated to ihew what degrees of each fign poiTefs the cufps of the
twelve houfts of heaven when the figure is ertdted. They begin with
the Sun’s entrance into the fign Aries, and ihew his progrefs through
each degree of the twelve figns of the zodiac.
Now let it be required, by way ofexample, to erefl a figure* for Fri­
day, the nth day of June, 1784, at 11 h. 24 min. A. M. that is, at
twenty-four minutes paft eleven o’clock in the morning. To do this, I
refer to the firft column of the right-hand page of the Ephemeris for
June, and oppofite the 11th day of the month, in the fecond column,
which has o ’s longitude printed at the top, I find 21. 3. 27, with the
fign n prefixed at the fide of the firft range of figures. This indicates,
that the Sun, at twelve o’clock that day, is in twenty-one degrees three
minutes and twenty-feven fcconds of Gemini; but the minutes and
feconds, when leis than thirty, are rejeited without fenfible error, and,
when more than thirty, have as many added as will make them up even
degrees. I therefore turn to the tables of houfes, and in the page enti­
tled Sol in Gemini I look for the column that has the fign n at the
top, which is the third; 1 feek for 21 degrees, and in the column on
the
O F A S t R O L O G Y . i93
the left fide of it, entitled Tim
efromn
o
o
n
, I find, even with 21 degrees,
5I1. 21 tnin. The hours and minutes thus found are uniformly to be
added to the time or hour of the day when the figure is erected, un-
lefs it be precifely at noon, in which cafe, as we have before obferved,
the places of the Sun, planets, and iigns, are to be fet down exactly as
they are found in the Epheifteris, and tables of houfes. But, the pre-
fent figure being eredlcd juft thirty-fix minutes before twelve o’clock, I
am to add this time, reckoning from noon the preceding day, to the
above 5h. 21 min. and from thefe two fums added together I fubtradt
twenty-four houts, and the remainder will give the degrees of each of the
twelve iigns, as then pofited uponthe cufps of the horofeope ; thus ;

Remainder 4 45
I feek this remainder in the table of houfes entitled Sol in Gemini, in
the column of timefrom noon ; but, not finding 4. 45, I take the neareft
number to it, which is 4. 46 ; and oppofite this number, in the next
column on the right, I find 13 degrees of Gemini in the tenth houfe,
which is denoted by 10th houfe n, at the top of the column ; and there­
fore I place thirteen degrees of Gemini in the line or cufp of the tenth
houfe of the figure. This done, I refer to the next cpluinn in rotation
to the right hand, and in the fame line with the degrees of
Gemini I find 20. 7, and, looking to the top of the column, find it to
be twenty degrees and feven minutes of the fign 25, with n houfe over,
and therefore I place twenty degrees feven minutes of Cancer upon the
cuip of the eleventh houfe. I follow the fame rule with the next co­
lumn, where I find 21.^8, and looking to the top find the fign s i, 12
houfe, and accordingly place twenty one degrees thirty-eight minutes
of Leo upon the cufp of the twelfth noufe in the figure. Then I refer
to the next column, where I find 17. 1, and at th^ top the word jifeen -
¿ant with the fign n. prefixed, which fignifies rhat lcventeen degrees one
minute of Virgo occupy the firft houfeor All aidant, which I place ac­
cordingly. I then refer to the next column, and even with the preced­
ing figures ftand 9. 15, when, looking up the column, I obferve the
fign below m
t, and 2 houfe at the top, which fhews that nine degrees
fifteen minutes of Libra are to be placed on the cuip of thefecond houfe.
This done, 1 refer to the laft column, and, even with the former num-
2 bers
194 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
bers, I find 7. 48; and, lookingup thecolumn as before, I obferve the
fign ni below and 3 houfe over, which indicates that (even degrees
forty-eightminutes of Scorpioareto beplaced on the cufp of the third
houfe. Thus the fix oriental houfes, namely, the tenth, eleventh, twelfth,
firft, fecond, and third, are furniihed with the degrees of each fign then
riling upon them ; and the fix occidental houfes, being oppofite to the
former! are always furniihed with the fame degrees and minutes of the
oppofite figns; thus:
Houfes oppofite. Signs oppofite.

So that the tenth houfe is oppofite to the fourth, and the fourth to
the tenth ; the eleventh to the fifth, and the fifth to the eleventh ; and
fo through the whole ; the ufe of which is, that, if on the cufp of the
tenth houfe you find the fign Aries, then on the cufp of the fourth houfe
you muft place the fign Libra ; and, whatever degree and minute of Aries
poffefles the cufp of the tenth houfe, the fame degree andminute of Li­
bramuft be placed on the cufp of the fourth ^houfe; and the fame rule
muft beobferved with all the other houfes and figns, which is univerfal
and ever holds true. For example, in the prefent figure, we have placed
13 degrees of n on the cufp of the tenth houfe ; now t being oppofite
to n, andthe fourth houfe to the tenth, I therefore place 13 degrees of
t on the cufp of the fourth houfe. Upon the cufp of the eleventh
houfe, 20 degrees 7 minutes of Cancer being already placed, and the
fifth houfe being oppofite to the eleventh, and v? oppofite ©, I there­
fore put 20 degrees 7 minutes of y? upon the cufp of the fifth houfe.
The cufp of the twelfth houfe being alfo occupied with 21 degrees 38
minutes of a, I place 21 degrees 38 minutes of the oppofite fign sz
upon the cufp of the fixth houfe, which is oppofite the twelfth. Upon
the cufp of the firft houfe, or afeendant, there is in degrees 1 minuteof
15, and thefeventh houfe being oppofite to the firft, and the fign x to
I accordingly place 17 degrees 1 minute of x upon the cufp or line
of the feventh houfe. Having alfo placed 9 degrees 15 minutes of
upon thecufp of the fecond houfe, I place 9 degrees 15 minutes"of the
oppofite fign r upon the cufp of theeighth houfe, which is oppofite to
the fecond. I then refer to the third houfe, upon the cufp of which are
placed 7 degrees 48 minutes of nu and the oppofite houfe to this being
O F A S T R O L O G Y , i95
the ninth, and « the oppofite fign, I place 7 degrees 48 minutes of
.Taurus, upon the cufp of the ninth houfe ; and thus the twelve houfes
are.comp!eatly occupied with the twelve figns of the zodiac, with the de­
grees afeending, at the precife time of erecting the figure.
Having fo far fucceeded, the next thing is toplacethe Sun, Moon, and
planets in the figure, agreeable to their pofition atthat timein the heavfcns,
and this is alfoto be done by the helpof the right-hand page of the Ephe-
meris. For inftarice, I again refer to the nth of June, and oppofite
to it, in the column of the o ’s longitude, I find him in 21 degrees 3
minutes and 27 feconds of Gemini that day at noon. But, as the figure is
eredled thirty-fix minutes before noon, I notehow far theSunhas moved
from noon the preceding day, and find he has gone at the rate of fifty-
feven minutes, which gives a difference of one minuteand twenty-feven
feconds for the time before noon, as follows :
min. fee.
Sun’s place at noon, June 1ith 21 3 27
Dedudt for 36 min. before noon o 1 27
Remains 21 2 o
Thus I find the Sun’s placeat twenty-four minutesafter eleveno'clock,
in 21 degrees 2 minutesof Gemini; which fign being then upon the cufp
of the tenth houfe, I therefore place the Sun in that houfe, clofe to the
fign, with thefe degrees and minutes, I then refer to the Ephemeris f or
the Moon’s place, and in the column of her longitude, oppofite the 11th
day of themonth, I find her in 5degrees 46 minutes of nr, at noon ; but,
to know her place thirty-fix minutes before, I note how much ihe goes
in an hour, and find her motion to be 35 minutes; then I deduct 21 mi­
nutes for the time before noon, and find her true place to be in 5 hours
25 minutes of Aries, which I accordingly enter before the cufp of the
eighth houfe, clofe to that fign. I then refer to the Ephemeris for the
planet J
?, arid on the nth of June I find him retrograde in 22 degrees
53 minutes of the fign Vf, wherefore I place him under Capricorn, in the
fifth houfe, with an R prefixed, to denpte that he is retrograde—I refer
to the Ephemeris in like manner for the planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus,
and Mercury, which I alfo enter in their proper places in thefigure, viz.
Jupiter in 7 degrees 36 minutes of x , Mars in 27 degrees 1 minute of
a, Venus in 5 degrees 5 minutes of u, and Mercury retrograde, in 24
degrees 2minutes of the fame fign.
The planets being thus entered, I next refer to the top of the fecond
page of the Ephemeris, for the column of the Moon's node, which we
term the Dragon's Head, and I find on the 7th day of the month it is
No. 10. Y y in
x96 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
in four degrees of Pifces; but, as it moves backwardabout threeminutes
per day, I dtduft eleven minutes, to bring it to the nth of June, and
its place will then be in four degrees 8 minutes of Pifces; I therefore
enter it in the fixth houfe, under the fign x ; and, as the place of the
Dragon's Tail is always oppofite to the Dragon's Head, I place it in the
fame degrees of the oppofite fign, which in this figurefalls in the twelfth
houfe, which is oppofite to the fixth.
The figure is now entirely compleated, except putting in the Part of
Fortune, which is the diftance of the Moon's place fromthe ftun's added
to nfrftadont. The mode 0/ determining this has commonly beenby
firil finding the true place of the Moon, then the true place of the Sun;
then lubtracting the Sun's place from the Moon's and adding to the re­
mainder the degrees of the afeendant; and this, if taken in the fphere of
the Moon, gives the place of the Part of Fortune. But, a much more
correft method having been adopted by the learned Placidus> we recom­
mend it inpreference toany other; it is as follows : Firit note the fign
and degree on the afeendant, and enter with the fame fign and degree in
the table of oblique afeenfions calculated for this work, in the latitude
wherein you erectyour figure; and in the common angle of meeting you
will find the number required. Then enter the fame table with the de-
greeof the Sun, and fubtrad: the oblique afeenfion of the one from the
other, and the remainder will be the Sun's diftance from theJ afeendant.
Then take the Right Afeenfion of the Moon, and enter the table of the
Moon's Right Afeenfion under the degrees of north or fouth latitude, as
£
he then happens to be ; and, when the Moon's Right Afeenfion isfound,
fubtrad it from the Sun's diftancefromthe Afeendant, andthe remainder
will be the Right Afeenfion of the Part of Fortune, For example, in
the figure before us : deg. min.
The fign m has 17 deg. 1 min. upon the Afeen­
dant, the oblique Afeenfion of which is 161 33
The oblique Afeenfion of the G (both being in
northern figns, nothing is added) is 47
Which being fubtrafled from the other, remains 113
T hen fubtratt the Right Afeenfion of the Moon, 2

Remains m 58
Which is the Right Afeenfion of the Part of Fortune. I refer for this
fum to the firft column of the preceding tables of houfes, under A. R.
t In this operation always obferve, that, if the iign afeending be fbuthern, and the fign in
which the Sun is pofited be northern, then add the whole circle of the zodiac, or three hundred
and nxiy degrees, of the northern iign; and v

which fignifies Right Afcenfion, and in the fourth table, or Sol in Can*
cer, I find m deg. 39 min. which is only nineteen minutes lefs; andop-
pofiteto this fum, in the third column of the table, (lands 20, with the
fjgn 2
3 at the top, and this denotes the Part of Fortune to be in 20 de­
grees of Cancer; but, as nineteen minutes were wanting to make up the
number, I allow one minute more, becaufe fifteenminutes on the equator
isequal to 1 minute of time; and hence the true place of the Part of For­
tune falls in 20 degres 1minute of Cancer ; and I accordingly enter it be­
low that fignin the fcheme, which is now compleated, and Hands thus.
This figure includes all that is required for the purpofc of judging
horary queilions, and the like; but, in nativities, and in the more imme­
diate concerns of life and death, regard mull be had to the fixed ftars,
according to their magnitude, influence, and pofitions near the afcendant
or its lord, near the Moon, or the other fignificators. And, becaufe it is
of importance to know their natures, qualities, and fignificators, I (hall
fubjoin a table of the mod confiderable fixed liars in the northern he-
nnlpherc, and then fhew how to colled fuch of them into the horofcope
as may relate to the iubjeii at any time under inveiligation.

The firft colum
ncontains the names of the ftars; the fecond column
/hews their longitude, or in what degree and minute of the twelve figns
they are fituated; the third column mews the degree and minuteof their
latitude, either north or fouth, which is denoted by the letters N. S*
The fourth column denotes their magnitude ; and the fifth /hews their
natural quality * for example : the ftar in the wing of Pegafus is in fix
degrees eleven minutes of Aries ; has twelve degrees thirty-five minutes
north latitude, is of the fecond magnitude, and participates of the nature
and quality of Mars and Mercury. The fixed ftars may be found and
diftinguiihed in the heavens by their conjunftions with the Moon, or by
obferving their order from any given point in the heavens ; thus, begin
with the Pleiades, vulgarly called thefevenJlars, and next to them in

fouth eye of the B u ll; next follows Orion s Belt or Girdle, which are three
ftars in a rank thus, ***, and arc vulgarly called the Yard or Ell.
Next follows a ftar called the Great Dog, which is a large bright ftar,
fomewhat lower than the Girdle of Orion. The next is called the head
of Gemini, and is about the height of the Seven ftars; there are two to­
gether appear thus, #*; the largeft of the two is the ftar here nomi­
nated. The next, which follows in order, is called South AJfellus, no
great ftar, but of ared colour ; there are two of them, near together and
alike, and ftand or appear thus, %; the loweft of the two is the ftar
here meant. Next in order follows a ftar called the Head of Hydra,
lower than Aflellus, and of a bright white colour. Then follows a ftar
in the flank of the Lion, very bright, and about the height of the Se­
ven Stars. Next to that the Virgin s Girdle, a bright ftar, and lower
than the flank of the Lion. And next follows a curious ftar called the
Virgin s Spike, very large and bright ; it is a ftar of the firft mag­
nitude, and appears a little lower, or more foutherly, than the Virgin’s
Girdle. Next in order follows the ftar called Artturus, a very remarka­
ble bright red coloured ftar, about the latitude of the Pleiades. Then
follows the ftar of the Crown, large and bright, and higher than Ar<ftu-
rus. Then the Right Shoulder o f Hercules, of a pale white colour, near
the altitude of the Seven Stars. Then follows the head of Ophincus o f
a pale white colour, and fomewhat fouthward of Hercules. Then ap­
pears a ftar under the armpit of Sagittary, a bright ftar, but very low.
Next, the bright ftar of the Vulture, large, and lower than the Seven Stars.
The next ftar is called 'the left Ihoulder of the W ater-bearer; about the
altitude of Orion’s Girdle, of a pale white colour The next in order is
the ftar called Marchab, being aftar of a bright colour, a little lower than
the Seven Stars, but much bigger. Then follows the Southern ftar of

Pifces, and Venus in five degrees five minutes of Gemini; and, their dis­
tance from each other being reckoned as before, they are found to be near
eighty-eight degrees apart ; and, as ninety degrees make a quartile, they
are now within each other’s orbs, and are confequently in a platic a
applying to a partile afpect, becaufe Venus is a fwifter planet than Jupi­
ter ; wherefore I note down this afpeft o t V . Then I find Mars in
twenty-l'even degrees one minute of Cancer, and Saturn retrograde in
twenty-two degrees fifty-three minutes of Capricorn j which, being op­
pose figns, and the planet’s degrees within each other’s orbs, conftitute
a platic oppofition, which I note thus, 8 h 3 • Thefe being all

thirty-two minutes north latitude. Eut, as no figure can be ercdled by
the foregoing tables of houfes for any other latitude than that of London,
without being re&ified by the pofitions of the poles, I here iubjoin a

Suppofe it were required to find the poles elevation of the eleventh,
third, twelfth, and fecond, houfes for the latitude of fifty-three degrees,
I enter the table at No. 53, under the title afeendant, and right againft
itl find under the eleventh and third houfes twenty-four degrees thirty
minutes, which is the poles elevation; and under the twelfth and fecond
houfes I find forty-two degrees twenty-fix minutes, which is the poles
elevation for the twelfth and fecondhoufes; and in this manner they may
be found for any other latitude.
Now, by knowing the poles elevation for thefe houfes, a figure of the
heavens may beeretied for the nativity of any perfon born within thirty-
one to fixty degrees of latitude. For example, fuppofe a perfon born
in fifty-three degrees of latitude, on the firft of June, 1784, at thirty-
fix minutes part five o’clock in the afternoon, what would be tue de­
grees of each fign upon the cufps of the twelve houfes ? to know this,
turn to the Ephemeris for the Sun’s place on the firft of June, and it
will be found in eleven degrees thirty minutes of Gemini; then refer to
the table oi houfes for the Sun in Gemini, and in the column under
lotn hcule, I look downfor 11. 30, but, finding no minutes, I look into
the column upon the left hand, under time from noon, where I find
4 h. 38 min. the next arch of time being 4 b. 42 minutes, I divide
the difference for the thirty minutes, which makes the true time 4 h, 40
min. To this I add 5I1. 36 min. the time after noon, which added to­
gether make 10 h. 16 min. which I feck in the column of time from
noon, and in the next column on the right hand I find the figure 2,
with 10 houfe m at the top, which denotes that two degrees or Virgo
arc at that time upon the cufp of the tenth houle. Then, in order to
know what figns poffefs the other houfes, I look into the firft column of
the table, with A. R. at the top, which fignifies the right alcenlion of
time, and even with the above number I find 154. o, which declares that
to be the right alcenlion of the mid-heaven. To thefe 154 degrees I
add 30, which make together 184; then I refer to the above table for
poles pofition in fifty-three degrees, and even therewith lland 24. 40.
which is the pole of the eleventh houfe. I then refer to the table of
oblique afeenfions, at the end of this woik, for twenty-five degree* of la­
titude, and feck the number 184, which I find in the column under Li­
bra, and12 min. over; then 1 look into the firft column of degrees in this
table, and even to 184 itand 4; but thcic twelve minutes being too
much, I equate for themby the Sexagenary tables, placed alfo at the end
of this work, by which I find that three degrees forty-three minutes of
Libra are to be placed onthecufpoftheeleventhhouie. Thenladd thirty
degrees to the above 184, for the twelfth houfe, which make 214. I re-

fer to the above table of poles pofitions in the latitude of fifty-three de­
grees for the pole of the twelfth houfe, which I find to be 42. 26>I re-
jed the 26, and in the table of oblique afccnfions for lat. 42 I feek 214
which I find under the column of Libraj and, looking into the firft co­
lumn of degrees, I find 27 ; but, equating by the Sexagenary table for the
odd minutes, it gives twenty-fix degrees thirty-one minutes of Libra for
the cufp of the twelfth houfe. Then, for the firft houfe or alcendant,
I add to the above 214 thirty degrees more, which make 244, and this
iumI feek in the above table under the pole or latitude of birth, which
is fifty-three degrees ; I turn to the table of oblique alcenfions for fifty-
three degrees, which I find in the column under Scorpio, and even with
it in the firft column of degrees I find 14, which (hews that fourteen
degrees of Scorpio are on the cufp of the afeendant. I then bring down
theabove 214, adding thirty degrees more for the fecond houfe, and thefe
make 271; I then refer to the above table of poles pofition for lat. 53,
and even with it in the column under fecond houfe I find 42. 26.—I re­
ject the 26 as before, and refer to the tables of oblique alcenfions for
forty-two degrees of latitude, where I feek No. 274, and find it in the
column under Sagittarius; and even with it in the firft column of de­
grees I find 14, which diredts fourteen degrees of Sagittarius to be placed
on the culp of the fecond houfe. Then for the third houfe I add thirty
degrees more to the above J 27j, which makes together 30{ j I then refer
for the pole’s pofition of the third houfe in the above table, and find even
with lat. 53 the number 24. 42 ; but, as thefe minutes exceed thirty, I
refer to the table of oblique alcenfions for twenty-five degrees, where I
feck 304, which I find in the column under Capricorn, and even with it,
in the firft column of degrees, I find 21 ; but, by equating as before for
the odd minutes in the Sexagenary tables, I find that twenty-one degrees
twenty-nine minutes of Capricorn are upon the cufp of the third houfe.
Thus the fix oriental houfes are furniihed with the proper degrees of each
fign rifing upon them at the time required, and ftand thus:

In this plain, eafy, and obvious, manner, may the fituation of the
heavens be found for any latitude whatever. But, to make it more eafy,.
it is neceflary to explain what we mean by the poles pofitions, and the
equations of time. If we imagine twelve great circles, one of which i&
the meridian of any given place, to interlefi each other in the two poles
of the earth, and to cut the equator in every fifteenth degree, they will be
divided by the poles into twenty-four femicircles, which divide the equator
into twenty-four equal parts; and as the earth turns on its axis, the planes
of thefe femicircles come fucceflively after one another every hour to the
fun. And, as in an hour of time there is a revolution of fifteen degrees
of the equator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of fifteen
minutes of the equator, and in a fecond of time a revolution of fifteen
feconds. Thus, to every place fifteen degrees eaflward from any given
meridian, it is noon an hour looner than on that meridian, becaufe their
meridian comes to the Sun an hour fooner. And to all places fifteen de­
grees weftward, it is an hour later, becaufe their meridian comes an hour
later to the Sun ; and fo on, every fifteen degrees of motion caufing an
hour’s difference of time. Therefore they, who have noon an hour later
than we, have their meridian, that is, their longitude, fifteen degrees
weftward from us; and they, who have noon an hour fooner than we,
have their meridian or longitude fifteen degrees eaftward from ours, and
fo, for every hour’s difference of time, fifteen degrees difference of longi­
tude. And, as we fhail have frequent occafion to equate the motions of
the equator with the hours and minutes of time, I here fubjoin two ta­
bles for that purpofe. *

If the reader in Table I. reckons the columns marked with afteriiks
to be minutes of time, “
the other columns give the equatoreal parts or
motion in degrees and minutes; if he reckons the aftetifk columns to be
feconds, the others give the motion in minutes and feconds of the equa­
tor; if thirds, in feconds and,thirds. And if in Table II. he reckons the
afterifk columns to be degrees of motion, the others give the time
anfwering thereto in hours and minutes ; if minutes of motion, the time
is minutes and feconds; if feconds of motion, the correfponding time is
given in feconds and thirds. An example in each cafe will make the

as afhew of boldnefs, courage, an

The quartile or oppofition of Saturn an
dMercury : if Saturn be figni-

akes the native wholly intent upon m

anifold m
isfortunes fromthe vulgar. If Luna be fignifi­
catrix, it is the afpedt of jealoufy, fufpicion, an
d miilruft, the native is
crooked both in perfon and m

of religion, virtue, piety, andm
oral honedy; and is the abom
inationof

The quartile or oppolition of Jupiter and the Sun : if Jupiter be fig-
nificator, it is the afpeft of arrogance and vain-glory ; the native is
profufeand riotous, given to all forts of excefs and prodigality, andlofes
his expedition ; this configurationdeprives him of all m
anner of honour
an
d preferment: he is noble, lofty, andbrave, but only inoutward ap­
pearance, and does nothing but to be feen of m
en. I f the Sun is figni-
ficator, the native wadesJ
h
is patrim
ony, is proud, lofty, and pragm
ati­
cal; a defpifer of the church and religion, and a great lover of pleafure
an
ddiflipation, to his own infamy and ruin.
The quartileor oppolition ofJupiterand Venus: if Jupiter be fignifi-
cator, it is the afpett offornication and lull; the native is given over to
debauchery, m
ore efpecially if Venus difpofes of Jupiter. If Venus
be lady of thefecond, the native wades his fortune and edatc, and will
becom
eindigent and poor; he follows bafe and lewd wom
en, and gets
a
ninfam
ous nam
e in the world. If Venus be tignificatrix, the native is
proud, pragm
atical, conceited, given over to carnal pleafures, adefpifer
of piety, virtue, honedy, and religion, one havingam
ere outfide, a flat­
terer, deceiver, a wader of his own fortunes and patrim
ony ; he will
havem
anyenem
ies created by his own evil ways, chiefly am
ong thofe of
the church, and people of anhoned converfation.
The quartile or oppolition of Jupiter and Mercury : if Jupiter be fig-
nificator, it is the aipedt of drife andcontention ; the native will be in­
volved in m
any troubles, controverfjgs, and perplexities, have m
any law-
fuits an
d incum
branes, to his very great prejudice, and to the injury of
hishealtha
s well asof his edate ; he will beralh, humourfone, an
d very
undablein all his ways, being generally deceivedjn all his expeditions ;
for M
ercury, thus affli&ed, reprefents things wrong to the im
agination.
If M
ercury be fignificator, it is the afped of folly and im
pudence, the
n
ativeis overfeen in all he undertakes, m
akes liUy..re(blvcs, and as fool-
ilhlyrepents of them to his prejudice ; a repining fim
ple creature, given
o
ver tofimplicity and abfurdity, to his own utter uudoing.
The quartile or oppofiton of Jupiter andthe Moon : if Jupiter be (ig-
nificator, it Ihews awading and lofs of fubdance by m
any ordinary peo­

akes the nativemutable, foolilh, without refolution, and one full
of w
ords without any depth or reafon in them; it Ihew
s alio lofs of
credit andedimation, and brings m
any popular evils on him; if the
Moon
9
a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
Mcon be fignificatrix, ‘the native is perplexed with unequal fortunes in
the world, m
any crofles andaiil¡¿lions befal him; falfe friends, an
d de»
ceitful confederates enlnare him, his iqbftance is m
ade a prey to merci-
lefsenem
ies, andhimfelf the obje£l of their cruelty.
The quartile or oppofition of M
ars and the Sun : if M
ars be fignifica­
tor, it is the afpett of confufion and ruin, the native aim
s at great and
high things, but falls at laft into an abyfs of trouble and m
iiery ; he
m
ifcarries in all his undertakings, heaps upon himlelf torrents of for-
row, and forebodes aviolent death, which, ifthe Sun belordof the fixth,
leventh, or eighth, houfes, will be by m
eans of a fall, or of a wound
with a w
eapon ; but, if lord of the tenth, by fentenceof ajudge. If the
Sun befignificator, it is the a
l’ped of vanity, fury, and m
adnefs; it ihews
dangerof thelofs of a
n eye, violent death, or death by am
alignant fever;
the native is raih in all his a&ions, fquanders away his fubitance, and
m
akes his life and fortunesiniferable anddefperate.

If Venus be fignificatrix, the native deludes himfelf with vanities, and
expeditions of things which will never be; he is angry, paffionate,

pt and re­
proacham

tile, or oppofition, of the infortunes, decreafing in number, light, and

Thefe diredions m
ay either fignify good or evil to thofe things which
we have fpecified them to fignify, according to the nature and quality of
the prom
iffor j for, if the direflion w
as to the fextile or trineof the pro­
m
iller, without doubt the things prom
ifed by that diredion m
ay be
em
inently good; if to the quartile or oppofition, very bad; and, if to
the conjundion, then according to the nature an
d quality of the planet,
and the houfes he is lord of, be he good or evil.
As the aicendant fignifies the body, m
ind, and life; the fecond, ef-
tate and fubftance ; and the tenth, preferm
ent, credit, trade, andfavourof
great m
en; fo alfo Sol, Luna, and the part of fortune, befides what they
im
port by being pofited in or lords of any particular houfe, fignify the
body, m
ind, fubftance, life, health, dignity, offices, affedions, eftate,
fortune, an
d friendihip, of great perfons. Thefe things being under­
flood, he that would truly judge of the effcdls of directions, ought
to confider the true fignification of the fignificator, of the promit-
tor, and of the houfe; firft, what they fignify eiTentialiy, and what ac­
cidentally ; fecondly, what by dom
ination, and what by polition; for
thofe things fignified by the fignificator fhall either be augm
ented or di-
minilhed, prelerved or deflroyed, firengthened or w
eakened, attained or
loft, according, firft, a
s the houfe or point w
here the direction falls is
fortified or vitiated, by the prefence or beam
s of good or evil liars; fe­
condly, according to the em
incncy of the fignificator; and, laftly, as the
prom
itTor is good or bad, flrong or weak.—Therefore the fignificator
fignifies the thing promifed; the houfe in which the direction falls, its
relation orquality; and the prom
iffor, them
eans of the accomplifhment;
wherein mull be conftdered the radical fortitudes of both, for accordingly
the effeds of the diredion will operate, and be durable, whether good
or evil, till this or fom
e other fignificator m
eets with anotherprom
iffor,
& e contrario; wherein note, that, if the fignificator be flrong, the thing
prom
ifed will be very good and great j which, if tht prom
iffor anfwers

great delay, labour, care, and toil: but contrariwife, if the fignificator be
weakj
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 241
w
eaks for then the m
atter will not be great nor em
inent, let theprom
if-
for be what it will.
If the fignificator difpofes of the place of the dire&ion, though an
evil one, the prom
iffor will not do fo much hurt as it otherwife would ;
but, if the prom
ilTor be difpofer of the place of an evil direction, it will
thenoperate with double force, according to the greatnefs of its malig­
nity. But, if another planet difpofes of the place of the direction, then,
according as that planet fympathizes with the fignificator, either by na­
tu
re, body, or beam
s, fo the good or evil fignified by the direction
{h
all be increafed or dim
iniihed.
If Saturn, Jupiter, or M
ars, befignificators, they will not be fo m
uch
im
pedited by evil prom
iiTors as the other planets arej but, whenever they
a

alefic afpeCts, they effeC

the revolution of the year.
The fignificator and prom
ifTor {hall fympathize together; .and, if the
good direction ihall fall in fextile to the radical place of the fignificator,
o
r n
ear the body of anem
inent fixed ftar, cohering in nature; that di-
reflion will fam

of fixed ftars of the firft, fecond, or third, m
agnitude, according a
s they
innature agree or difagree with the fignificator, fothey will fuddenly and
unexpeftedlyeither help or im

fignified by the houfe in which the direction falls.
J U D G M E N T S to be inferred from T R A N S I T S .
Tranfits of good planets by good places or prom
iflors fignify good, but
by evil places, evil; and fo contrariwifc.' And whatfoever we have be­
fo
re faid of directions, the fam
e things, in an inferior degree, are to be
u
n
cieriio
o

the effects of a tranfit are generally over as foon a

oft.
But
2 4 2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
But the tranfits of the fuperiors, a
s Saturn and Jupiter, are very em
i­
nently tobeconfidered, for they neverpafs without obvious effe&s, which
often laft awhole year, be they good or evil ; for, if they be lords of ill,
houfes, or radically in an ill houfe, if they tranfit the afcendant, the
quartile, or oppoGtion, or place of its lord, they threaten life ; if the
fecond or its lord, the fubftance ; if the third or its lord, journeys; if
the fourth or its lord, danger to the father, or lofs of inheritance; if the
fifth or its lord, lofs by gam
ing, anddeathof children; if thefixthor its
lord, death of cattle; if the feventh or its lord, iicknefs of the wife;
if the eighth or its lord, lofs of fubftance, becaufe they caft their op-
pofition unto the fecond ; if the ninth or its lord, lofs at fea, robbing by
land, envy of churchm
en ; if the tenth or its lord, the king’s difplea-
fure if acourtier, but lofs of trade if atradefm
an; if the eleventh or its
lord, evil friends, or their affliction, the lofs of hopes; if the twelfth o
r
its lord, death, and lofs by cattle.
Obferve on what day the m
oon or other planets caft their trine or
•T
extiletothecufp of the fecond, or tranG
t the trine or fextile of its lord,
or planet near its cufp, orcaft their trine or fextile to the part of fortune,
for thofe days will be good to the native, and very profitable; and, if
he m
ind hif bufinefs, he m
ay then have aftoniftiing fuccefs; but thole
'd?ys in which the faid planetstranfit the quartileoroppofition will be as
bad, wherein, If he lofes not m
oney, he is fure to get none; and this I
have found m
ore than athoufand tim
es true ; the fem
e if anevil planet
tranfits theconjunction of the lord of thefecond or part of fortune; but
the tranfits of agood planet to their conjunction are advantageous.
Saturn and Jupiter, if they be lords of good houfes, and tranfit the
good afpeC
t or conjunction of any fignificator, with whom they agree in
nature, or w
ere radically in good aipeC
t with, fignify much good.
If good planets or the lord of the afcendant tranfit the m
edium cceli,
or place of its lord, or its fextile or trine, the native gets honour, o
r
trade, and, if he bein purfuit of any preferm
ent, he attains it.
The lordof the afcendant, tranfiting theafcendant or his radical place,
thews health to the native; the fecond, or the conjunction, fextile, o

goodjourneys, and the friendship of kindred andneighbours, &c.
The lord of the feoond tranfiting thecufp thereof, or his radical place,
denotes gain; the third houfe, or the conjunction, fextile, or trine, of its

The tranfits of thé Moon difcover all things, whether good or evil,
which happen to am an daily, through the whole courfeof his life ; her
application to, or tranfits of, fextiles and trines, (hew good ; of quartiles
and oppofi.tions, evil, concerning all thofe things fignified by that houfe
in which the tranfit is made; where, if (he be fignificatrix, the good or
evil will alfo fall in part upon the things fignified by her, according to
the houfe (he was lady of, or pofited in the radix ; but, if not, the good
or evil will fall upon thofe things fignified by the fignificator which is
tranfited.
*
J U D G M E N T S to be inferred from R E V O L U T I O N S .
Thejudgments of a revolution are eafy to be determinied, by confider-
ing in what houfe and fign in the revolution the radical fignificators are
pofited ; for according to thofe revolutional pofitions and configurations
we are to judge. So that, if the lord of the fecond houfe be in the third, it
(hews gain to come either by travel, or by kindred, or neighbours; and, if
he be alfo in fextile or trine with the lord of the third in the radix, the
fame; if with the lord of the fourth, by a father; if in the medium caeli,
or in conjunction, fextile, or trine, with his radical lord, gain by trade,
ofiice, preferment, or noblemen. Hence it appears, that the fignificator of
fubfiance in a revolution is not the lord o f the fecond in the revolution,
but the lord of the fecond in the radix ; the fignificator of lands is not
the lord of the fourth in the revolution, but the lord of the fourth in the
radix; the lame is to be underftood of the red; but, if the fame fign which
afcended radically afcends in the revolution, its effects will be the more
firm, becaufe the fignificators are the fame; the like, if the fame planets
which were lords o f the feveral houfes in the radix be lords of the fame
in the revolution, though they poiTefs not the fame fign.
Whatfoever good or evil is prefaged unto the native, either by direc­
tion, tranfit, or revolution, we are to meafurc thegrcatncfs thereof, ac­
cording to the radical ilrength or fortitudes of the fignificators, compar­
ed with their ilrength or fortitudes at, the time of direction ; where, if
they are radically (Irong, the good or evil will be great and permanent,
the which is confirmed if they be ftrong alfo at the time of direction or
tranfit j if radically weak, the good or evil will but meanly manifcft it-
felf; and fcarcely at all, if weak at the time o f direction or tranfit * but,
if radically weak, and ftrong at the time of the direction or tranfit, the
efie<fl6 thereof may appear much beyond the expectation of the native,
but will not be very durable.

honour andpreferment, but makehimfaftiousand proud, and therebyen­
danger the lofs of all his happinefs. To Arifta t this certainly gives the
native eminent honours, with a great augmentation of his fortune and
eftate; if Arifta culminates, and the Sun comes to it by dire&ion, it
fhews ecclefiaftical preferment, or fome eminent place under govern­
ment. To Cauda Leonis, though no very good direftion, yet it aug­
ments the native’s eftate, and raifes him to fome honour, but withal de-
ftroys itagain, caufing much melancholy, and difeafes from thence. To
Lucida Maxilla Ceti, Genu Caftoris, Genu Pollucis, Ventre Gemini,
Cynofura i thefe dire&ions forefhew much evil to the native’s body, ef­

evil reports, tohis great prejudice. To Hircus, it fhews martial prefer­
ment, honour in war, exalts the native both in wealth and dignity,,
makes him ingenious, and apt tofindout many rare inventions.

vexes and afflicts him with crofs neighbours, kvv-fuits, andother trou­
bles. To the Afelli: this direction afflicts the body with many evils ;
and, if it falls near theoppofition of Saturn and Mars, or the Sun, it is
much if the native be not blind j or have fome continual diftemper in
theeyes, or pains in the head. To Cingula Orionis, Lanx Borealis, Ax­

cedens & fequens Orionis ; thefe directions forefhew honour, glory,
renown, and wealth from the king and other noble perfons, give thena­

To Arifta, honour, glory, and preferment both in church andftate, the
overcoming of an adverfary j dominion over the common people, and
gain- by them
-. ’ To Cauda Leonis, gives honour, and a good eftima—
tion among the vulgar, but withal- threatens fcandal, lols, and con­
tempt. To Lucida Maxilla Ceti, Genu Caftoris, Genu Pollucis, Ventre
Gemini, Cynofura, fcandal, odium, and fcornevenof the common fort;
the ill will of fome eminent lady or woman; danger of thieves,
a$o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
fuch like perfons. To Lucida colli Leonis, ala Leonis, dorfo Leonis,
Lnnx auftrali$/Gei|jii& tibia dextra Ophinci, Deneb, Ultima in dorfoCa­
pricorni, finifter humerus & cubitus dexter Aquarii; thefe are evil di-
reftions, giving the-n$tfive melancholy difeafes, efpecially in thofe parts
ii^nified by the fign inVhich the ftar is ; he goes alfo under fcandal and
reproach. To Hircus, is avery noble diredtion, andmayfienify thead­
vancement of the native in all things, chiefly in military affairs ; yet in­
volves himin fcveral vices and troubles with women ; and bids him be­
ware of fome fevere wound by a fall, blow, or ftab. The fignifications
of the part of fortune, beingdirected in like manner, are altogether the
fame with what we hintedin the directions of the fecond houfe.
In all thefe directions we muft havegreat regardboth to the fignand the
Tioufe. In directions which concern the body, we have refpedt to the-fign,
becaufe that mod commonly indicates the part afflicted ; fo alfo does the
houle ; for, if the direction falls in theafeendant, the affliction falls in the
head, as onthe eyes, nofe, ears, or brain ; if in the fecond, in thethroat,
&c. In directions which concern the eftate, honour, or fortune, we
chiefly take noticeof the houfe, for that indicatesthe m
eans by which the
•thing ihall be attained ; the nature of the ftar, the quality of theperfon;
if in the third, by a kinfnun, or by travel; if in the feventh, by a wife,
or woman.
In direfting any planet to thefe fixed ftars, confider whether the ftar
fympathizes with the fignificator in natureandquality, ornot; if it does,
the directionmay begood, although it be toanevil ftar; for fweet to fweet
is fweet; like tolike breeds nodifeord ; anunionandagreement ofnatures
takes away the evil effects ; for, if thelord of the afeendant was Saturn,
and he ihould be directed to Cauda Leonis, aftar of his own nature, this
could be no evil direction, nor any way afflitt the native either in body
or eftate; but would have famous andgloriouseffetis, both for healthand
wealth, according to the place it falls in. In thefe directions we are
principally to regard the magnitude of the ftar; for ftars only of the firft
magnitudeprefage things eminently glorious or dangeroufly deftructive;
and thofe which are of the fecond come very near them. Then the place
of the direction is to be noted ; for, if it falls in an angle, the direction
will not only be famousand eminent, but alfo manifeft itfelf with agreat
deal of life and vigour, and that ona fudden ; in afuccedent houfe, the
effects will be more languid ; in a cadent, notonly weak fcndflow, but it
may be a queftion whether they will ever operate at all. Regard muft
alfo be had to the latitude; for ftars having fouth latitude operate not
fo much upon our northern hemifphcre as thofe which have north ;
thofe which have no latitude ihew their effect, be they good of evil,
1 with
O F A S T R O L t 5 i
with ttridi equality ; and thofe which have north lavande manifefl their
force with great vigour. -
The Sign alio in which the Itar is pofitedis confidered; for
fixed ttars in cardinal figns exceed the othersvHwower by fo much as
their place is more excellent and remarkable. if adirection toany
eminent fixed itar falls in fextile or trine to the places of any of the for­
tunes or of the luminaries, or coheres with any other eminent direction
at or near the fame time to the bodyor afpeéi of any planet of the nature
of the fame itar, the etFeCts will not only be indubitably evident, but
alfo very itriking and wonderful.
The durability of their effeCi remains only to be confidered; wherein
muft be noticed, whether there bea continued feries of directions attend­
ing, of the fame purport and effeCt ; for, if there be, and nothing contra­
dicts their influence, theeffects of them will, we may fafely conclude, be
durable and tailing.
APHORISMS for guiding the JUDGMENT upon NATIVITES and
HORARY QUESTIONS.
Conflder thedegree afcending, Sol and Luna; and feewhether they are
afflidted, or not; if they are extremely afflicted, or either of them, it is an
argument of (hort life, and therefore it will be in vain to form long di­
rections for fuch a nativity. Thefe points are faid to be afflicted or un­
fortunate, when either the conjunction, quartile, or oppoiition, of the
infortunes vitiate their places, or when many violent fixed itars of the
nature of thelord of the eighth afcend with the degree afcending or with
the luminaries.
Confider the lord of the alcendant alfo; for, if he be eflentially ftrong,
free from the affliction of the infortunes, not combuit nor retrograde, nor
impedited by the lordof thefourth, fixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, but
cncreafing in number, light, and motion, it thews long life. If the Sun
in a birth by day, or the Moon in abirth by night, be itrong, free from
affliction, and aflifled by thefortunes, it thews long life; but thofe who
are born exactly upon the very change or full of the moon feldom live 1
long t the Moon befieged between Saturn and Mars argues iliort life.
That planet which has moil dignities eflential and accidental in a
figure is the lord of the geniture, more efpccially if he be lord of the
afeendant alfo.

woman, and a good houfe-wife; but, being ill-affected, the woman may
have virtues, but are generally clouded ; applying to Mars well-
affected, it ihews one of a lofty, honourable, open, and generous, mind ;
a true friend, yet {corning to receive any affront or injury, and one that
will defire to be mailer j but, being ill affected, an evil, quarrelfemej,
proud, petulant, woman; applying to the Sun, being well-affected, ihews
an honourable and truly nohlc creature, full of generofity and humanity,
affecting high and great things; but, if ill-affected, ihe will be idle,
vain, foolifh, proud, infulting, anddomineering; to Venus well affected,
a beautiful, fair, pleafant, civil, courteous, loving, good conditioned, and
virtuous, woman ; but, if ill-aftcdted, ihe is an impudent, bold, arro­
gant, prodigal, talkative, luffful, bafc, woman; laftly, the Moon applying

The lordsof the tenth and feventh, or fecond andfeventh in each others
houles of the figure, or in mutual reception, ihew a good wife; but the
lords of the fixth or twelfth in mutual reception, or pofition with the
lord of the feventh, (hew a very mean, ^obfeure, ill-bred, woman. Sa­
turn or Mars in the feventh, very ftrong, iliews'a good and rich wife,
yet her fubffance not attainable without trouble; if peregrine there, it
thews one of low birth, poor, and ill-conditioned; if Jupiter, Sol, or
Venus, bethere, the contrary. If the figniheators of man and wife be in
quartile or oppolition of one another, or in quartile or oppofition to the
Moon, there will be many quarrels, and that upon very flight occafions ;
the contrary if they be in conjunction, fextile, or trine, or in mutual re­
ception or pofition ; or if the Moon makes any tranilation between them
by good afpect. The lord of the feventh in quartile or oppofition to Sa­
turn or Mars, fhews anevil woman, immodeff and ihamelefs; and, if the
lord of the feventh be in the twelfth, although in trine with Venus, the
woman will prove inconffant to her huiband.
If Mercury and Luna be in conjunction or reception, or the lord of
the ninth bein the afeendant, orthe lordof the afeendant be in the ninth,
or Mercury or Luna be in the afeendant, third, or ninth, or mutual re­
ception of their lords, or in conjuuction with them, the native will tra­
vel beyond fea, or take many long journeys. The caufe ___
appears from thenature of the fignificator, and the houfe in which he is
pofited; if Saturn befignificator, the caufe is from feme inheritance, le­
gacy, or things and commodities faturnine; if Jupiter, the caufe is from
religion,
O F A S T R O L O G Y . t$7
religion, ecclefiaftical preferment, honour, or law; the like of the other
planets. If the fignificator be in the afcendant, the native is pofleft with
a natural deiire of feeing ftrange countries; in the fecond, he travels for
a dcfign of enriching himfelf; and foof the other fapufes.
If the lordof theninth bein theafcendant, thenativewill travel much ;
if in the fecond houfe, he will gain confiderably by his travels; if in the
third, he will cohabit with ftrange women, and often fliift his refidence;
if in the fourth, his parents will have fome occult infirmities, and he will
die on his travels; if in the fifth, he will havechildren in another coun­
try ; if in the fixth, he will gain by his ilaves or fervants, and his cat*
tie will fall lick in his travels; if in the feventh, he will obtain a good
and obedient wife. When the figniheators of journeys are eflentially
ftrong, well pofited, and free from affliction, and in fextile or trine of a
good planet, they denote honour, profperity^and fecurity, in travels, quod
capax9 according to the quality of the peribn; and contrariwife, if Sa­
turn or Mars afflift the fignificators, it (hews, in the twelfth houfe,
dangerof imprifonment; in the fecond or third, treachery by kindred or
neighbours, ordanger by commonthieves ; but, in this judgment, Saturn
fhews rather poverty and want of money; Mars bodily wounds. The
countries into which thenativehad beft travel, are chiefly thofe fubjedl to
the figns of the afcendant, fecond,, ninth, tenth, and eleventh; or thofe
figns in which Jupiter, Venus, Part of Fortune, or Dragon’s Head, are
pofited; but thofefubjeft tothe figns in which the infortunes or Dragon’s
Tail are pofited, will prove unfavourable to the traveller ; and fo alfo will
thofe that are fubjefl; to the figns of the fourth, fixth, feventh, eighth,
or twelfth, houfes.
Saturn, Mars, or the dragon’s head, in the ninth, or Saturn or Mars in
the third, oppofite to the ninth, Jupiter being peregrine, cadent, and af­
flicted, fhews either pernicious feftaries of no religion, or atheifts. But
Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon’s Head, in the ninth, fhews a truly reli­
gious perfon i the fame if Sol, Mercury, Luna, or Part of Fortune, be
there in fextile or trine with Jupiter or Venus. If no planets are in the
ninth, confider its lord and Jupiter ; if they or either of thembe efTen-
tially fortified and ftrong, or angular, or in reception with Sol or Luna,
or with the lord of the afcendant or planets therein, or pofited in the afe
Cendant, the native will be truly piou$*J*Qiieft# and religious; and fo con­
trariwife. Saturn intheninth, effentially ftrong, fhews ftrong zeal, chaf-
tity, and faith; Sol there, fhews piety, and makes an excellent preacher.
If Sol or Jupiter bath dominion in the ninth houfe, or in the afcendant,
and hath dignities in the-places of Mercury or Luna* the words of the

Saturn in the tenth never lets the native enjoy his honour and prefer­
ment long, but calls him down head-long, when lead expected \ from
which
OTP A S T R O L O G Y . 259
which deje&ion he never rifes. The lord of the afcendant in textile or
trine with the Sun, and oriental, or in trine or Textile with the lord of
the medium cceli, the nativewill attain to honouranddignity, and bebe­
loved of kings, princes, and noblemen. If the lord»<^the afcendant be in
the fign afcending, or in his own dignities, fifewilltife,to honour and e-
fteem by his own induftry, moreefpecially if he to a planet angu­
larand in hisown exaltation. The quality of the prefermentis difcerned
fromthe planetorplanets which apply to theluminaries, or to which the
luminaries apply: if Saturn be that planet, preferment comes by means
of an eftate, inheritance, pofleflions, or favour of anceftors; if Jupiter,
by means of virtue, honour, or learning, orhonefty, gravity,juftice, reli­
gion, or wealth j if Mars, by valour, or by merit as captain or general in
the army, or by being a phyfician, furgeon, chemift, &c. if Venus, by
courtfhip, pleafantnefs, or through the means of women* if Mercury,
by wit, judgement, oratory, or learning* by the law, merchandize,* &c,
wherein alfo coniider the houfe in which this planet is. If no planet be­
holds the luminaries, or is beheld by them, then coniider the planet in
the tenth, and theftrongeft planet there, if there be many* if no planet be
in the tenth, coniider the lord of the tenth, and difpofer of the light of
time, or that luminary which is either above the earth or ftrongeft, and
judge ut fupra> for, if the planets (hewing the preferment be elTentially
itrong, free from afflidtion, and affifted by other planets in quartile or
trine, the native’s honour will be permanent, otherwife not.
Mars in his detriment, and in oppofition to theafcendant, (hews anun­
fortunate and infamous man. Mercury in quartile or oppofition to Sa­
turn caufes an impediment in the tongue or Tpeech* in conjunction, Tex­
tile, or trine, Jupiter makesexcellent orators, ofgreat reafon, undemand­
ing, andjuftice, and gives them great friends amongchurchmen and law­
yers * in afpedt with Mars, he inclines to phyfic, furgery, chemiftry *
in quartile or oppofition of Sol, to coining money* in fextile or trine
with Luna, gives him a good underftanding, and inclines him to the
knowledge of things to come, to arts and fciences, as philolophy, phi­
lology, mathematics, medicine, &c. if her application be in Virgo or
Scorpio, the native proves a lover of the mathematics. Mars in afpedt
with Sol gives the native power, authority, and magiftracy, making him
famous. Jupiter, Sol, Venus, or Luna, in the eleventh, effentially forti­
fied, and in conjunction, fextile, or trine, with the lord of the afcendant,

portends blindnefs; the fame if the luminaries be in quartile or oppo-
iition of Mars. Saturn in the imum cceli, although ina fortunate gene*
fis, foreftiews an evil end to the native, though he be a prince.
Jupiter lordjjf the geniture, or in the afcendant, makes thenativeofa
noble and brave fpirit, aiming at good and honeft things, without the
ienfe or leaft imagination of evil. But, if either of the luminaries, or
Saturn, or Mars, be in quartile or oppoiition to him, he proves proud,
treacherous, and a perfeft villain, who under the notion or fandity may
lhroud a thoufandenormities. Jupiter or Venus poiited in the afcendant
or medium cceli, freefromafflifFion, makes the native beloved of all forts
of perfons, though his birth be ever fo mean; and gives him a juft, up-
rignt, and honeft, foul. Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon’s Head, in the
fifth, in a fruitful fign, (hews many children; and, if Luna be in any
good afpeci with them alfo, (he (hews dill the greater number.
Saturn or Mars in the ninth, and Dragon’s Tail in the afcendant, ge­
nerally makes the native an atheift in judgment, though a pried by pro-
feffion. Saturn upon the cuip of the fecond makes the native always
poor, let him have what aflidance foever; unlefs he be effentially fortified
there, and in good afpett of the fortunes. Saturn and Mars in oppofition
to equinoctial figns makes (if a king) a great tyrant; and, if they be in
quartile with Jupiter, he may be an obferver of law and religion, but it
will be for his own ends. Saturn in oppoiition to Luna, or Mars in op­
poiition to the afcendant, makes an ablolute knave and a traitor.
Mars lord of the geniture in the afcendant, eifentially fortified, makes
a courageous perfon, agood foldier, furgeon,or phyfician, and onehonour­
able in his profefiion. If Mars be drong in a nativity, and lord of the fe-
venth, in no good afpeft to the luminaries or afcendant, the native will
be unfortunate in war, controverfies, and law-fuits; for the feventh houfe
iignifies his enemies, and in this refpeCl they will be-too powerful for
him. Mars in the medium cceli brings fcandal and dilhonour to the
native in many things, whether he deferve it' or not. Mars in Aries,
Scorpio, or Capricorn, inthe afcendantofa nativity, makes the nativejn-
vingjble; and this more efpecially if he be in good afpeftof the lumina­
ries, or planets eflcntially fortified. Mars in conjunttion, quartile, or
oppoiition, to Luna, and Saturn in the fame afpett of Sol from angles,
(hews a violcnt_dcath. If fo pofited in violent figns, though out of an­
gles,thefame. If MarsandSolbeinthefecondhoufe,effentiallyfortified, the
fnativemay have a good edate, but will haveways enough tofpend it; but,

.Mars and Sol intheafcendant, in aereal or fiery figns, make proud»-icoui-
ful, prodigal, pcrfons, conceited of thcmielves. Mars in oppofition to
Jupiter or Venus deitroys the ifliie of the nature thpfgh ever fogreat and
.numerous. .
Sol lqrd of the geniture, or flrong in the afcendant, makes the»native
aim at fovereignty, rule, and dominion; who, quod capax% will bevery
famous; .the fame if .Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, afcend, and the Sun be
flrong and in trine with Jupiter. Sol in the afcendant makes a great
boafter and very proud perfon ; Mars there, denotes a notorious liar, ro­
mancer, and inventor of fables and a contriver of mifchiof, gtvenlover to
perjury, violence and cruelty. Sol or Luna in quartile or oppofition to
Saturn or Mars frpm angles, chiefly the medium cceli, (hews a violent
death; if to Mars only, and in humane figns, the native will beflain by
the hands of his enemies ; if to Saturn, he will either havea great fall,
be imprifoned, or itarved to death in a prifon. Sol and Luna amifted in
watery or airy figns the native greatlywith the gout. Sol and Lu­
na in conjunction of Venus in Cancer or Capricorn give the nativeagreat
fancy and a large und$rftanding. If Sol, Luna, or the medium cceli, be
directedto the conjunction, Textile, or trine, of Jupiter or Venus, the na­
tive, if in years, generally marries. Sol, Luna, or the afcendant, being
Hyleg, direfted to the conjun£tion, quartile, or oppofition, of Saturn, and
the direction being in Aries, Cancer, or Leo, the native rarely efcapes
death when thefe directions come up, becaufe thofe figns reprefent the
moil vital parts in man’sbody, and Saturn in the oppoiite figns has mod
power to do mifehief. Sol and Mercury in conjunction in the third or
fourth makes the perfon ikilful in occult arts and fciences. Sol, Luna,
or the afcendant, in a geniture of fhort life directed to the Dragon’s Tail,
generally proves mortal,
Venus, lady.of the geniture, or ilrong in the afcendant, makes the na­
tive a great lover of pleafure, of an upright, juft, honeft, heart; but, if
(he be weak, and afflicted by Saturn or Mars, the native is libidinous*,
fenlually and beaftly inclined, and will be affii&ed with venereal dif-

RUDIMENTS of the DOCTRINE of RADICAL ELECTIONS.
If any thing be really intended to be obtained, the tim

ginning and undertaking thereof ought to .b

of life, and nothing elfe. For at that tim
e, once for all, thegreat God
deputed every fignificator to acertain purpofeof fignification, an
d firm
ly
eftabliihed thelam
e, forever unalterable by thepow
erof nature. There­
forein m
aking an ele&ion, firft corre&ly learn what planet is the true
an
d real fignificator of the thingdefired, for, without the true knowledge
thereof, all is in vain; fecondly confider the nature and quality of the
thing, w
hether it be proportional to the capacity of himwho defires it,
or im
poflible.
Confider alfo to what houfe of heaven the fam
e doth appertain, and
w
hat em

d what
planets in the radix beheld it by friendly afped. Note likevtfife the re­

lord thereof, or beholds it by good afped. Confider the prom
iffor, o

hoped for is to beobtained o
r perform
ed. Then confider in every elec­
tion the fourth houfe fromthe houfe fignifying the thing, its lord, and
planet pofited (if any be) therein; for that hath fignification of the end
ofthe m
atter.
Let the radix be direded, with afpeculum com

Jupiter iVeemifsly hot and moift, Mars extremely hot and dry, the Sun
is meanly hot and dry, Venus is hot and moift, Mercury is remifsly cold
and dry, the Moon is meanly cold and moift. I f Saturn be in Aries, his
hiucrs i,s inc;eaft?d, and his coldnefs abated, or he is intenfely dry, or re-
mifsly cold. In Taurus he afts with a double force, viz. he is intenfely
cold and dry; in Gemini he is remifsly cold and dry, in Cancer he is in­
tenfely cold; fo that if Saturn afpedl the afcendant from any of theie
figns, he varies his influence according to the fign he is in. A planet in
his hoi.'fe, as the Sun in Leo, retains his own nature, and is well affedted
in influence, but if in his detriment, as in Aquaries, he is then ill
aflfe&ed or depraved. If he be only peregrine, he is meanly affedted as to
gliod or evil, viz. neither effentially ftrong nor weak; if in his fall, he
/flags in bis motion, and is a man indifpofed and uneafy. Therefore a
planet in his fall or detriment effcdts no good to the native, if any, it is
depraved, and consequently dangerous or pernicious.

A planet diredt and fwift in motion, or on the contrary, is as thofe very
terms import ; therefore their celerity, orientality, and their pofition, if
fuperiors, fupra terram, makes them more manifeft and powerful. Aries
aicending gives martial wit and inclination, but, if the Sun be in par­
tile, trine, or fclmfe', to it, or its lord, or in conjunction of Jupiter, who
may be in platic fextile or trine to either of them, then it is made folâi
and jovial, but chiefly iplar. Underftand the like in other figns afcend-
ing, according to their refpeétive nature, and the nature alfo of thofe pla­
nets that behold them.
The nature and ftatc of every planet muft be attended to ; for a pla­
net may be confidered in relation to the portents or lignification of any
fign or manfion of heaven ; thus, Firft as to pofition; fécond, dominion;
third, exaltation; fourth, afpeét ; fifth, oppofition thereunto; as for ex­
ample, Saturn in Aries muil be confidered as Martialized and Solalized,
becaufe Aries is the houfe of Mars, and the exaltation and triplicity of
the Sun, and lb in others. The afeendant in any nativity is to be ob-
ferved, alio the lord of the afeendant and his pofition, or a planet pofited
therein ; all which are to be confidered by the reader or ftudent as to the
portents or lignification of the afeendant. The fixth houfe lignifies dif-
eafes, but yet the twelfth Iball be a configurator in all corporal afflic­
tions, as being in oppofition thereto.
From the lord of the afeendant, or any other houfe, proceeds the chief
virtue or moft powerful part as to the lignification of that houfe; if Sa­
turn and the Sun be in conjunction in Leo in the tenth houfe, the latter
being neareft to the cufp thereof, then the native arrives to lome, deg/Ccf
of dignity or honour from the analogy, pofition, dominion, or-fértitude,
of the Sun, as alfo his propinquity to the cufp. But Satufn being of a
contrary nature, and adverfe to what the Sun portends, alfo hating the
place of his refidence, and partly afflidting the Sun, wiiiTl^rcfofe^trf^.
lome unhappy misfortune to arile, and cloud the glory promised by the
Sun in the end. Saturn in conjunction with Jupiter in Virgo is moft
powerful, and overcomes in his efFecls ; but, if they are conjoined in
Aries, then Jupiter is ftrongeft, and becomes viâor. This reciprocally
by each being in his fall.
The luminaries are to be confidered as more powerfuTand fignificVnt
than the reft of the planets; and therefore any of the fuperiors in conjunc­
tion with the Sun in Leo influences much power and honour to the na-'
tive by virtue of the Sun, &c. So if Saturn be in conjundion with Ju­
piter in Sagittary, the houfe of Jupiter, then Saturn ads in dépendance
to his difpofitor. Any planet ftrong in a good houfe is of good fignifi-
cation.
O F A S T R O L O G Y . *73
cation, but much better if the ptenet be a fortunate one by nature. À
malefic planet, weak in the tenth houfe, denies honour, if they behold
either the cufp or the lord thereof by any malevolent afpeét ; then many
impediments or obftructions prejudice or hinder theijfrttvf’s advancement.
Mars in the mid-heaven, ftrong, ufually portends%y$|tary preferment,
^[¡gnity, or profeffion. • ’
Saturn or Mars, ftrong in a good houfe of a figure, are as difeords in
mufic, corrected to effect a concord or harmony in founds ; for, being
well affected, they caufe a perfect good, though it be attended with dif—
^
ficult means or methods to accompany it. In fine, their good is always
tempered with fomething of evil, becaufe they are naturally more propenfc
to effect evil than good ; as for example, Saturn in the fécond houfe, or
lord thereof, and ftrong, gives riches by rapine and covetoufnefs ; in the
feventh he denotes the death of the wife. A malefic planet meanly af­
fected in a good houfe oftentimes obftructs or prevents what is naturally
fignified thereby, or at beft but meanly effects a good. As for example,
Saturn meanly affected, viz. peregrine in the fécond houfe, gives not
riches, yet retains them when gathered, by being fparing and penurious.
Mars fo pofited and ill-affected, diflipates or deftroys an eftate by prodi­
gality, and fuch other imprudent expences. Saturn, debilitated in the
eleventh houfe of a nativity, produces trouble with or by the means of
friends unrelated ; and the analogy is according to the debility of the pla­
nets, and how they are beheld, and mitigated by Textiles and trines, or
contrarily inflamed by quartiles or oppofitions.
An infortune in conjunction with a fortunate planet, is either impeded
or deprived of the good fignified ; for, though the fortunate planet be in
his own lïruife, yet he partakes fomething of the nature or analogy of
the malefic, with whom he is conjoined. Three planets or more in
conjunction, act jointly and feverally according to their refpective na­
tures, and to their heavenly ftates, but principally according to the nature
and ftate of the moil ftrong and ruling planet. If an infortune, cfpccially
Saturn, be placed between two planets which are in conjunction, he pre­
vents or retards the good promifed by the other two planets ; the nature
or kind thereof is difeovered by the houfe of heaven wherein fuch a con-
grefs is made.
/ *
The lord of the afeendant applying to the conjunction of the Sun ia
y nativity, ihews the native apt, or delights to converle with honour*
able perfons, grandees, and fuch-like ; as alfo will be ambitious of fame,
honour, and dignity, &c. If he apply to Saturn, the native affects to
converic or affociate himiclf with perfons o f an inferior rank, viz. rus­
tics,
274 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
ties, plebeian«, &c. He ¡6 fubje&'fcf envy, fear, penfivenefs, and co-
vetoufnefs. Two planets in reception a£t or difperfe their influence in
an amicable method, and, if benevolent by nature, their virtues are the
more powerful.^Many planets in cardinal figns in any geniture, always
efledt fome greal^^mgs ; if in one houfe, the native receives or fuifers
an excefs of good or evil,' according to the nature of that houfe. ThV
benevolent planets Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury alfo, retrograde in any
nativity, is of eminent import, adding to the felicity, of a native, and this
is the more powerful if they are applying to the conjunction of the earth;
but the rétrogradation of Saturn or Mars in angles, is ever attended with
difficulties and unhappineffes, from which portions I (hall always pray,
Libera nos, Domine.

The A R T of R E S O L V I N G H O R A R Y Q U E S T I O N S .
IT is an observation moil true, that all people endued with reafon are
folicitous to know their future eftate and condition; but, as fome
perfons find it impofiible to procure the exa& time of their birth, aftro-
Jogy fupplies that defcft by the dodtrine of Horary Queilion s. So that
from a queilion ferioufly propounded almoil as much iatisfadlion may be
given the querent, upon many fubjedts of enquiry, as if his nativity were
adually known. For, as the nativity is the time of the birth of the body,
the horary queilion is the time of the birth of the mind; and there are
few perfons living but are in fome way or other fubjedl to horary doubts,
which, being ferioufly propounded in the ihape of a queilion, may be fatis-
faitorily refolvcd. This doctrine feems to be founded upon that miraculous
fympatby in nature, which is admirably manifeiled between the Moon
and the lea; by which that amazing body of water is conilantly drawn
after her, though no man ices, or can conceive, how. In thefe fympa-
tbies there can be no doubt but the vegetive loul of the world inviiibly
carries and unites a fpecific virtue from the heavens between one thing
and another, every where working thofe fecret effects, which no mortal
can fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, who is to determine what
this fcul cannot effect between the heavenly bodies and the animal
fpirit of man, working fuch Sympathies, as that a queilion of impor­
tance to our welfare cannot ilart from the mind but in a point of time
when the planets and figns governing the perfon’s birth are acting up­
on the very fubject that engages his thoughts and attention. And hence
the birth of the queilion, like the nativity of a child, carries the ilory of
1 the
¿;8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
the whole matter in hand upon its forehead. And hence-alio follow»
that íkill innatural predi&ions by which the artift it enabled tqdedjton-
ftrate the particulars of the event required ; and this as well by theftars
of heaven as Abiathar the prieft was of old enabled to do by the fart of
the ephod. £
> . , ‘
But, however, the predictions that are made from the queftionary way
are by no means fo perfeét and corred as thole deduced from nativities;
and therefore I recommend all judgments of futurity to be made from na­
tivities, when they can be procured, rather than from horary queftions.
But at the fame time 1 am very confident that the omnifcient Creator is not
at all wantingforany poffiblecarein his contrivance of the works of nature,
for the fupply of all our moderate wants and enquiries. And, if it be ef-
fcntial to man’s welfare to be forewarned of the time and thejudgment, as
Solomon declares it is, and that the wife man Jball know it*, then it is
plain that God has afforded means to obtain this knowledge without a mi­
racle ; and this means may furcly be by the fars of heaven, refponding
our horary queftions; and experience continually affirms, day by day, that
it is fo. Not that I believe the trivial concerns and accidents of mankind,
as fame writers have pretended, may be thus deduced, as if a glove, loft or
or hidden in fport and wantonnefs, fhould be fo watched and attended
by the heavenly intelligencers, that they muft needs point out where this -
piece of leather were to be found ; or that queftions propounded out of
mere curiofity or diverfion are to be refolved by them. No; God's works
are ferious, and not to be made the fport and ridicule of the gay and incon-
fiderate. For, although the heavenly contrivance may aptly relpond our
ferious and important concerns, as when David anxioufly dcfired to know
•whether befl.ould go up into any of the citiet of Judah, and which ofthem f
yet that they fhould as aptly fatisfy our intemperate defires, and be fub-
fervient to our frolics, is too ridiculous to imagine. There is no doubt
but the heavens are able to fhew us more learning than we mortals, in this
ftate of frailty and corruption, can ever attain to underftáhd ; and i( is a
great bounty of God that we know fo much as we do; therefore it highly
becomes every wife and good man to glorify the Maker of all things for
the little knowledge he can and doth attain, and to be careful how he
fperts even with the leaft among his gracious works.
All enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the denomination
of an horary queftion, muft necefifarily relate either to things pajl, pre-
fent, or to come; or to concerns that once were, noware, or may be hereafterj
and the anfwer to fuch queftions muft be either ejjential or accidentals
The eftential anfwer is always one of the three things following, to wit,
* Ecdcf. viii. it. and v. 6.
that
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 279
that the matter concerning which the.enquiry is made is, firft, to be or
not to be 1 ihcotid, either good or bad; and, third, either true or fa lfe .
Therefore, i f the queftion be real, and the matter rightly ftated, the
true anfwer, which is always ihort, will be eafily difcovcred by the
following roles. The accidental anfwer is that which appertains to the
accidents of the buiinefs in hand; and is always defined by where, when,
how, or why* And whoever attempts to extend his judgment beyond
thefe limits strains art beyond its bounds, and forces it to fpeak that which
it is totally incapable of, and by this means many pretenders to Aftrology
fail egregioufly in their undertakings. To avoid this, let the following
queries be attended to.
QJJ E R Y I. Is the Subject of Enquiry to be or not t o be ?
Here the firft thing to be attended to is the perfection or defiruCtion of
the matter under confideration. The perfection or completion of the
fubjeét of enquiry may be effe&ed four feveral ways, viz. by the ap­
plication, tranjlation, reception, and pofition, of the planets ; and thefe are
determined and defined by the proper and refpe&ive fgn ificators of the
fubjeCt of enquiry: which are, firft, the lords of thofe houfes which re­
late to the matter in hand ; fecondly, planets near the cufps of thofe
houfes ; thirdly, planets exalted or dignified therein ; and, fourthly, the
confignificators of thofe houfes. The lords of the houfes are thofe planets
which are lords of the figns that happen to fall upon the cufps of the
hcufes. Tne confignificators of each houfe are as follow ; of the firft
hcufe, or afcendant, Saturn and Mars; of the fécond, Jupiter and Venus;
of the third, Mars and Mercury; of the fourth, Sol and Luna; of
the fifth, Venus and Sol; of the fixth, Mercury alone; of the feventh,
Luna and Venus; of the eighth, Saturn and Mars; of the ninth, Jupi­
ter alone ; of the tenth, Mars and Saturn ; of the eleventh, Sol and Sa­
turn; and of the twelfth, Venus and Jupiter. From hence it appears
that each houfe hath a primary and fecondary confignificator ; the firft
whereof arifes from the order of the planets, the other from the order
of figns.
The confideration of the matter propofed is taken from that houfe
which hath relation to, and fignification of, the fame ; and this ligni­
fication of the houfes is cither Ample or compound. The iimple figni­
fication of the houfes is that which hath relation fingly to the perfon
of the querent ; compound fignification is that which hath relation to
thé matter, or quefited. The querent is he or file that aiks the queftion;
the matter, or quefited, is that about which the queftion is propofed.
The fimple lignifications of the houfes are as follow : the firft houfe
No. 14. 3 U fignifies
2Bo a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
lignifies the querent's life and perfon; the. fécond, his fubftance; the
third, his kindred, neighbours, and ihort journeys; the fourth, his grave,
father, and lands j the fifth, his pleafures and offspring ; the fixfh, his
ficknefs, fervants, and fmall cattle ; the feventh, his wife, public ene­
mies, and law-fuits ; the eighth, his death, and legacies; the ninth, his
religion, long voyages, and learning; the tenth, his mother, trade, and ho-,,
nour; the eleventh, his friends and hopes; the twelfth, his private ene­
mies, great cattle, imprifonment, and crolfes. The compound fignifica-
tion is derived from the fimple, by confidering what houfe that is which
fignifies the matter, or quefited; and accounting that, be it whatfoever
houfe it may, for its afeendant or firft houfe; and lb aferibing the figni-
fication of the firft houfe of the figure to it: doing in like manner to all
the other houfes in order. So that, if a queftion relates to a brother or re­
lation, the third houfe is then his afeendant or firft houfe, and fignifies
his life and perfon ; the fourth houfe (which is in this cafe his fécond)
his fubftance or eftate; the fifth houfe (his third) his relations and ihort
journeys; thefixth (his fourth) his father; the feventh his children; the
eighth his ficknefs ; the ninth his wife, &c. and the fame of all others.
Thefe things being laid as a foundation, we now come to (hew the perfec­
tion of the matter by the different affections of the afpetis.
Application is when two planets haften to conjundlion or afpe& of one
another. The light planets only apply to the more weighty. So Saturn
applies to none; Jupiter only to Saturn ; Mars to Saturn and Jupiter;
Sol to Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; Venus to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and
Sol; Mercury to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol; and Venus; and Luna to
them all. But, if any of the higher planets be retrograde, they may then
apply to a lighter by rétrogradation. Thus Saturn may apply to Jupiter,
Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Jupiter to Mars, Sol, Venus,
Mercury, or Luna; Mars to Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Venus to
Mercury, or Luna; and Mercury to Luna, when retrograde. In this
application the lords of each houfe are not only to be tonfidered, but alfp
the confignificators of the fame; for, if they alfo apply together by good
afpeft, we may give the more probable judgment. Thefe applications
may be always difeemed by the Ephemeris ; wherein may not only be
feen when the Moon applies to any alpeci, but alfo when any of the other
planets apply to one another.
Tranflation is when a planet feparates from the body or afpe& of one
planet, and immediately applies to the conjunction or afpedl of another.
And the planet tranflating is always lighter, except in rétrogradation,
than the planets from or to whom the tranflation is made. So Luna
may tranflatc the light of the other planets from one to another; Mercury
2 may
2Sl
O F A S T R O L O G Y .
may tranflate the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venns, from
one to another; Venus the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and^Sol, from
one to another; Sol the light of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, from one to
another; Mars the light of Saturn and Jupiter fron^one to another; but
Jupiter and Saturn, without rétrogradation, can make no tranflation. This
tranflation is to be confidered between the lords of the houfcs fignifying
the matter, the planets near the cufps, and the confignificators of the
fame. So, if the queftion belong to the feventh houfe, and Sagittarious be
on the afcendant, then Jupiter is lord of the afcendant, and Mercury of
the feventh; Saturn is the firil confignificator of the afcendant, and Mars
the fécond; Luna is the firft confignificator of the feventh, and Venus is
the fécond. And, if the tranflation be between Jupiter and Mercury, or
Saturn and Luna, or Mars and Venus, it may poflibly perform the mat­
ter; but, if there be a tranflation between them all, as alfo between pla­
nets pofited near the cufps of the houles, the thing will undoubtedly be
brought to pafs, the fame as by application. A more weighty planet may
alfo make a tranflation by feparating in rétrogradation from a weightier
than himlelf, and applying to a lighter than himfelf. So Jupiter, being
retrograde, may feparatc from Saturn or his afpeft, and tranflate his light
and virtue to Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna.
Reception is either Angle or mutual. A Angle reception is, when but
one of the fignificators receives the other into his dignities, viz. his houfe,
exaltation, or triplicity; this is but of fmall force, and is called difpofi-
tion. Mutual reception is when two planets are in each other’s dignities;
as Mars in Gemini and Mercury in Aries. This reception is threefold,
cither by houfe, exaltation^ or triplicity. By houfe, when Saturn is in
the houfes ofjupiter, and Jupiter in the houfes of Saturn. By exalta­
tion, as when Saturn is in Aries, the exaltation of Mars; and Mars in
Libra, the exaltation of Saturn. By triplicity, as when Saturn is in Leo,
the triplicity of Mars; and Mars in i aurus, the triplicity of Saturn. There
is alfo another reception of dignities; and that is, when one planet is
in another planet's houfe, and that planet in the other's exaltation or
triplicity : as Saturn in Taurus, the houfe of Venus ; and Venus in Li­
bra, the exaltation of Saturn, or in Virgo, his triplicity. Thefe recep­
tions are remarkably ftrong and forcing, if they fall either in the antif-
cions of each other, or in or near each other's Textile or trine.
Pofition is-when cither the lords of two houfes concerned, or the con-
fignificators of the fame, or both, are pofited in each other's houfes; or
the lord of the afcendant, or its confignificator, or both, are pofited in
the houfe fignifying the thing, or laftly, when the lord or coniignifica-
tors of the houfe fignifying the thing are pofited in the afcendant.
282 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
So, if the queftion belongs to the medium cceli, if the lord of the afcen-
dant be found in the medium cceli, or lord of the medium caeli in the af-
rcndant, or in mutual pofition, it perfedts the thing defircd. This pofi-
tion is eminent, and* if the falA fignificators be poiited in the antifcions
or other dignities of each other, or of the planets fignifying the thing, it
abfolutely dcnotes^he full completion of it ; more efpecially if the faid
fignificators By pofition are in fextile or trine to each other; or to Jupi­
ter, Sol, or Venus, or to lords of good houfes. The power of antifci^
ons are equal to a fextile or trine, chiefly if they fall near thofe points,
or in the dignities of their proper planet, or both. Thcfe antifcions arc
to be confidered in all the Ways aforcfaid; to wit, in application, tranf-
lation, reception, and pofition, in which they efFedt much more than
otherwile could be imagined. If there be application of one or both fig­
nificators, though to no afpedl, but to the antifcion of the other figni­
ficators $ or reception by antifcion with good afpedt, or a real pofition
in antifcion of the one, with a good tranilation to the other, fignificator,
it perfects things beyond expedtation. And thus, by any or all of the
foregoing circumilances, may the fubjedt of enquiry be brought to pais,
and completed.
The matter is deftroyed by prohibition, which is when the fignifica­
tors arc applying to an afpedt, and, before they can come to that afpedt,
the lighter or applying planet comes to the conjunction or afpedt of ano­
ther; which planet deftroys what is dcfired. Or by fruftration, which
is when fignificators are coming to an afpeCl, and the more weighty pla­
net, before they can make that afpedt, meets with the conjundiion or af-
pect of another planet, and thereby fruftratcs the former afpedt. Or by
refranation, which is when two fignificators are coming to an afpedt, and,
before they can make that afpedt, the applying planet falls retrograde
if direft, or if retrograde he becomes diredt, before he can make the
faid afpedt. ^ .
Things are alfo deftroyed by afpedt, which is when the fignificators
apply to the quartile or oppofition of one another, without reception;
or by the conjunction of the Sun, which is called combuftion, and is. the
greateftafflidtionof all. Alfo by feparation, whichis, when the fignificators
of the querent, and thing proposed, have lately been in afpedt, and are
newly Separated, though never fo little ; and this denotes .the full and
abfolute deftrudtion of the matter, which we feldom or ever find to fail.
The quality of the afpedt likewife fhews the condition of the thing or mat­
ter lately pafled, if it was good, good; if evil, evil; and it is either
totally deftroyed, or at leaft brought to pafs with much difficulty, if the
tranilation be made by quartile or oppofition. But more efpecially if
another
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 283
another planet at the fame time (hall tranflate the virtue or light of both
fignificators to Saturn or Mars, or to the lgrds of evil houfes.
If there be a tranflation between the figSISators by^iqiiiftrtile or oppofi-
tion, or by fextile or trine, and, before the tranflation can be made, one
or both of the fignificators (hall go into another fign, the matter will
come to nothing. If there be prohibition, fruftration, refranation, evil
afpedt, reparation, or evil tranflation, by quartile or oppofition, without
mutuaWeception, it is enough to deftroy the matter, but more efpecially
if fome or all of them happen to be in fixed figns, and in a luccedent or
cadent houfe of the figure, or from the houfe fignifying the thing. Move­
able figns are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn; fixed figns are Tau­
rus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquaries; common figns are Gemini, Virgo, Sa-
gittary, and Pifces ; angles, are the firil, fourth, feventh, and tenth ; fuc-
cedents, are*the fecond, fifth, eighth, and eleventh, houfes; cadents, are
the third, fixth, ninth, and twelfth, houfes.
Q U E R Y II. Is the Matter G O O D or E V I L ?
Confider the houfe to which the thing belongs, its lord, and planets
therein ; and the houfe fignifying the matter of the end, its lord, and pla­
nets therein; and, if the houfe fignifying the thing be fortified by the
prefence or beams of good planets, or eminent fixed ftars of the firft or
fecond magnitude, or if the Dragon’s Head be there, it (hews good, but
the contrary, evil. The fame more particularly, if the lord of the houfe
fignifying the thing be angular, ftrong, and eflentially fortified; or in
good afpeit to the cufp of that houfe fignifying the matter of the end, its
lord, or planets pofited therein; but the contrary, evil.
Likewife mutual pofition or reception, and the fignificators in good af-
pe<ft with the fuperior planets, or planets more weighty than themfdves,
are all teftimonies of good. But the fignificator of the thing peregrine,
•flow in motion, retrograde, or feparated from the lord or planet in the
houfe fignifying the matter of the end, are all fignificators of evil. The
houfe fignifying the matter of the end is always that which relates to the
thing or things expetted from the queftion propofed; for example, if the
queftion was, Is it good to remain ? here the end of the query is to be un~
derftood, whether it be for health, wealth, preferment, or the like ; if for
health, the afeendant fignifies the matter of the end; if wealth, the fecond
houfe ; if preferment, the tenth, and fo on.
/ QJLJ E R Y III. Is the Report T R U E or F A L S E ?
Thefe judgments are drawn from that {¡oufe, its lord, and planet
therein pofited, lignifying the matter or thing concerning which the re­

wit, the plan
ets that fignify he, ihe, or that thing, which (h
all hinder
o

an, w
om
an, or thing, is difeovered from
the im
pediting planet, by confidering w
hat houles he is lord of, an
d
w
hat he is pofited in. The houfe he is lord of d
en
otes the quality or

an, or thing; the houfe he is pofited in
,' the
m
atter; an
d the houfe in which the prohibition o

the caufe or reafon
.
If the im

hether the pla­
net fs good or evil, m
afeuline or fem

hether in a m
afeulirie
or fem

d accordingly judge of the effects m
ore
rem
ifs or exaft, a
s they m
ay be brought to p
afs either by m
an, w
om
an,
or thing; judging alw
ays in this cafe by the fuperior teftim
onies. And
obferve, laftiy, that w
hatfoever h
as been faid of the im
pediting or hin­
dering placet, the fam
e is to be underftood of the planet adjuvant, or
helping. #
The next thing to be confidered, is the propriety of the queftion pro-
pofed, an
d the iincerity of the querent; for it fom
etim
es happens that
queftions areim
properly an
dincorre&ly ftated; and at others, that they
are put through knavery an
d im
pertinence, with a view to injure an
d
difgrace the artift. In thefe cafes, the queftion not being radical, no
anfw
er can b
eobtained; an
d therefore he who attem
pts to refolve them
,
will bring flum
e upon him
ielf, an
d difgrace upon thefcience. Every
queftion, to be radical, m
uft be lincere an
d natural; and, unlefs they a
re
fo, they cannot be refolved. Therefore, to ascertain their Iincerity on
the one hand, and their fitnefs or unfitneis on the other, the following
rules m
uft be obferved.
Ere£l the figure a
s before direfted; an
d ifthe iign afeending, an
d the
planet in the afeendant, deferibe exadtly the perfon of the querent, the
queftion is radical, and fit to bejudged. But, if either the very begins
ning or extrem
e end only of the fign afeends, it will not be proper tq
givejudgment; for it denotes the querent to be aknave, an
dthe queftion
a forgery, propofed m
erely out of ridicule an
dintem
perate m
irth. This
rule I haveoftenverifiedinpraftice, by direftlychargingthequerent with
fuch defign; an
d the effett this unexpefted difeovery had upon themh
as
ufually produced anacknow
ledgem
ent of it. The fam
e thing is indicated
.by the quartile or oppofition of the M
oon with the lord of the feventh
houfe; or by the M
oonbeingvoid-ofcourfe, orcom
buft; whichpofitions
likewife d
ein
o
te thequeftion to b
e im
properly an
dincorrectly ftated. Sa­
turnintheafeendant, im
peditedan
dafflidted, thew
s thequeftion propofed
to be either falfe, or without ground, or thelubjcdl of it paft hope; and,
w
henever the lord of the afeendant is found com
buft or retrograde, it in­
dicates thefam
e thing, and (hew
s thequeftionis propofed to anfw
er fom
e
abfurd orknaviihpurpofe, and therefore not to be m
eddled with.
/Any queftion m
ay be deem
ed radical, w
hen the lord of the afeendant
an
d the lord of thehour are of the fam
e nature an
d triplicity. Thus,
fuppofe Leo afeends upon the horofeope at the tim
e the queftion is pro­
No. 14. 3Y * pofed,
28
8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
pofed, an
d M
ars happens to b
e lord of the hour, the queftion will be
radical, becaufe the Sun, which is lord of the horofeope, an
d M
ars, are
of on
e nature, viz. hot an
d dry. So, if Jupiter belord of the hour, the
queftion will be radical, becaufe the Sun an
d Jupiter are of the fam
e
triplicity; an
d this obfervation extends to all the other planets, an
d uni­
form
ly ftiew
s thequeftion proper to bejudged. But, w
henever the.tefti-
m
onies or fignificators in the figure are found equally ftrong for and
againft them
atter propounded, it ought not tobeadjudged; fpr theartift
knows not which way the balance m
ay yield, an
d therefore judgm
ent
fhould be deferred to afuture tim
e.
There is one rule by which the radicalnefs of aqueftion m
ay be af-
certained w
ith greater certainty, or at leaft with lefs probability of mis­
take, than by any other; an
d this is by the m
oles with which every
perfon is m
ore or lels m
arked. It is really a
n aftonilhing fad, an
d no
lefs extraordinary than true, that thefem
oles or m
arks a
re all uniform
ly
diftinguifhed by the figns an
d planets which prevail at the tim
e of birth,
if n
ot abfolutely produced by them
. It w
as the truth an
d univerfality
of this obfervation which firft led to the difeovery of that affedion an
d
governm
ent with the cekftial figns haveupon the different m
em
bers of
m
an's body ; af<
i6
t fo obvious, that, notwithftanding all endeavours to
refute the idea of planetary influence, yet this fad is annually recorded
in every alm
anack, an
d fin
ds a place in alm
oft every other aftronom
ical
publication.
According to this rule, w
henever aperfon com
es to propound aquef­
tion, let a figure of the twelve houfes be ereded forthe querent; then
note w
hat fign is upon the cufp of the afeendant, an
d in the part of the
querent's body which that fign governs, if the queftion be radical, the
querent will haveam
ole. For inftance, if Aries be the fign afeending at
the tim
e, the m
ole will beon the h
ead or face; if Taurus, o
n the neck
or throat; if Gem
ini, onthe arm
s or fhoulders; if Cancer, onth
pbreaft;
an
d fo upon an
y other part of the body which the fign afeending (hall
govern. Obferve next, in which of the twelve houfes the lord of the
afeendant is pofited, andin that part of the body the fign governs which
happens to fall uponthecufpof that houfe will thequerent haveanother
m
ole. Next obferve the fign defeending on the cufpof the fixth houfe,
and inw
hatever part of the body that figngoverns the querent will find
another mole; and upon that m
em
ber alfo which is fignified by the fign
w
herein the lord of the fixth houfe is pofited will be found another.
Obferve alfo what fign the M
oon is pofited in, an
d in that part of tlie
body which is governed by it ijiall the native or querent find another
m
ole. If the planet Saturn be the fignificator, the m
ole is either black
~ or
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 289
or of a darkcolour; ifM
ars be fignificator, an
din afieryfign, itihen re-
fem
bles afear, cut, or dent, in the fieih; but in any other ngnit is a red
m
ole. If Jupiter be the fignificator, the m
ole is of a purple or bluiih
cart; if the Sun, it is of an olive or chefnut colour; if Venus, it is yel­
lowi if M
ercury, of a pale lead colour; if the M
oon, it is whitiih, or
participates of the colour of that planet with which flie happens to bein
afpeft. And, if the planet which gives the m
ole be m
uchim
peditedor
afH
ifted, the m
arkor m
ole will be largerand m
ore vifible.
*} ^,
If the fign an
dplanet which gives the m
ark orm
ole be m
afeuline, it
is then fituated o
n the right fideof the body; but if fem
inine, on the
left fide. If the fignificator or planet which gives the m
ole be found a­
bove the horizon, that is, fromthe cufp of the afeendant to the cufp of
the feventh, either in the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, or fe-
venth, houfe, the m
ark or m
ole will be on the forepart of the body; but
if the fignificator be under the earth, that is, ineither the firft, fecond,
third, fourth,dfcM
Rfe fifth, orfixth, houfe, it will befituatedonthe back
or hinder part of the body. If onlyafewdegreesofthefign afeendupon
the horofeope, or defeend on the fixth; or if the lord of the afeendant,
lord of the fixth, or the Moon, bepofited in the beginning of any fign,
the m
ole orm
ark will be found upon the upperpartofthe m
em
ber thofe
figns govern. If half thedegrees of a fign afeend,or the fignificators be
pofitedin the m
iddle ofany fign, the m
ark or m
olewill be in them
iddle
of the m
em
ber; but if the laft degrees ofafign afeend, or the fignifica­
tors are in the latterdegrees of a fign, the m
ark of m
ole will then be fi­
tuated on the lower part of the m
em
ber filch fign governs.
If the queftion be radical, the tim
e rightly taken, andthe querent fin-
cere, and of fuificient age, this rule will feldomorever be found tofail.
In afeertaining the exa& tim
e of any perfon’s nativity, I have found it of
excellent ufe; never having beenonce deceived by it in the fm
alleft de­
gree. In com
pany I have frequently tried the experim
ent upon aftran-
ger, an
d ever found it correfpond, to the aftoniihm
ent of all perfons
prefent; and it is anexperim
ent which any read

ay eafily m
ake upon

onths of Novem
ber and Decem
ber,
w
hen figns ofihort afeenfions ye upon the afeendant, great care m
uft be
taken to be exafl in point of time; for in thofe m
onths the Sun is fre­
quently not vifible, and clocks are not alw
ays to be depended upon;
therefore without proper care the right afeendant m
ay eauly be m
illed,
for Pifces an
dAries bothafeend inthe fpace offifty m

i
conform
ity of the m

fcnt thttn. Thus by lookingataperfon'snativity, an
dattendingto thefe
rules, the reader may exactly point out an
d deferibethem
olesin any part
of the native's body, though it be aperion he n
ever fawor converfed

e, he m
ay fafely venture his life upon

Thcfe particulars, being explained, will give lightfufficienttotheaftro-
logian, whereby he m
ayjudge of any other queftionproper to this houfe.
O f the Length o f the Qyerenfs L ife .
Torefolve this queftion, obferve the iigruafcending, the lord thereof,
and the M
oon ; and if they arefound free fromthe m
alignant beam
s of
the infortunc#,.o
r of the lords of the fourth* lb&h, eighth, and twelfth,
houfes, and not combuft, the querent’s life will not be ihort; and, if
the figniiicators are not afflidted by the prefence of violent fixed ftars, it
m
ay be ftill further prolonged; but if the lord of the afeendant be com­
buft an
d retrograde, and in an evil houfe of heaven, the querent is not
likely to live long. When the figniiicators are unfortunately afpedted
from good places of the figure; or the benevolent planets interpofe their
rays, the m
alevolence threatened will be fom
ewhat abated; but if it be
fromevil houfes in the horofeope, and the benevolent planets afford no
help, danger of aihort life is m
uch to befeared. ""
O f the Good or E v il attending L ife .
The good or evil that attends each perfon is diftinguifhed by the for­
tunate and unfortunate radiations in the figure. When benevolent pla­
nets p
o
fiT
cfs the afeendant, or the principal places of the figure, they in­
dicate much good to the querent through the whole courfe of his life.
And if the lordof theafeendant and the Moon be friendly afpebied by the*
beam
s of the fortunes, although from m
alignant places of the fchem
e, ‘
yet it prefages good to the native, inafm
uch as an accidental evil cannot
rebateo
r*w
ifchftan
d an efiential good. But when the infortunes poflefs
thefe places, or by evil afpe£t afflidt the figniiicators, the querent will be
fubject toa troublefom
elife. If Saturn poffefs the afeendant, thequerent
will be m
elancholy and penfive, and fubject to perplexities from aged
men. If M
ars, he will be choleric, and liable to oppreflion by knaves
and fwindlers, and fom
etim
es by the treachery of kindred ; if the Dra­
gon’s tail be in theafeendant, he will never be free from 1
‘
candal and dis­
grace. When the afflittingj>lanets are lords,of uopropitious houfes,
the evil will be longer durable ; but, when the affiftingplanetsare lords

of it. But this m
ethod is only to be taken w
hen queftions of weighty
concern are propounded; uponany trivial orordinary bufinefs it is wholly
unnecefiary. In m
atters of little im
portance, it is iufficient to ob-^
ferve the degrees of diftance betw
een the fignificators, either of their
bodies or afpefls, which will point out the tim
e correctlyenough. When
fixed ftars of a violent nature occupy the principal parts of the figure,
the afeendant, m
id-heaven, orplaceof the Moon, they prefage fudden an
d
unexpected mifehief; but w
hen fixed ftars, of anoble and generous na­
ture, pofiefs thofe places, they dem
onftratefudden and perm
anent good to
the querent.
W hat Part o f the ®ucrent's L ife is likely to be mof profperous.
To refolve this queftion, it only requires to obferve in what part of the
figure the fortunate ftars are, and according to their pofition judge of it.
If the propitious planets are in the afeendant, the twelfth or eleventh»
houfes, the native will profper m
oft in his younger days. If in the tenth,,
ninth, or eighth, in them
iddle part of his age. If in the feventh, fixtb,/
or fifth, after his m
iddle age. If in the fourth, third, or fecond, his
latter days will be the m
oft com
fortable and happy. The tim
e is ascer­
tained by reckoning for every houfc fituated betw
een the fortunate
planets and the afeendant five years, if the fignificators of life be weak; '
if m
oderately dignified, fix; but, if the fignificators of life are rem
arka­
bly ftrong and well dignified, then feven years m
ay be.reckonedfor every
houfe.
Toward what P a rt o f the W orld may the Querent direEi his Courfe to
profper. •
It is a m
isfortune not very uncom
m
on for perfons to undertake long
journeys an
d voyages, m
uch to their prejudice an
d diiadvantage ; for, al­
though all places are aliketo him that m
ade the earth, yet they are not fo
to m
en that poffefs it ; therefore it will be requifite for thofe who judge
queftions of this kind to obferve the following rules, or at leaft a
s m
any
•A them a

vidcd into four quarters; eaft, weft, north, and fouth ; and thefe four
quarters are again fubdivided, viz. the firft houfe is full eaft, and the
twelfth houfe, being inafcenfion next unto it, is eaft by fouth ; theele­
venth next unto that, fouth by eaft ; and the mid-heaven fouth, &c.
Now according to thefe quarters of the heavens, thus divided and fub­
divided, look.for the benevolent planets Jupiter, Venus, Luna, and the
part of fortune, or the m
oft of them
, an
d diredt the querent in his affairs
thither. For example, fuppofethefe planets (hall be in the m
id-heaven,
that being fouth, diredt thequerent fouthward ; if they be in the ninth,
it is beft to go fouth-weft. If in the weft, it is his intereft to go full
weft; and fo of the reft. Confider alfo the nature of the querent’s de­
fire, whether it be for health, riches, honour, friends, &c. that he en­
gages in his undertaking $for, by rightly underftanding the queftion, the
querent’s defire ihall be the m
ore readily anfwered. If it be for health
he would rem
ove his habitation, obierve where or in what quarter the
lord of the. afeendant and the Moon are pofited, and diredt him that
way. If, for riches, take notice of the lord of the fecond and the part of
fortune. If forlaonour. confider the Sun and the lord of the tenth. If
for friends, the lord of the eleventh; andfoof the other fignificators.
A Perfon having important Bitfinefs with another,Jhall hefin d him at Home ?
The truth I have always found in the anfw
ers to this queftion princi­
pally induced m
e to give it a place here; for I have often tried the ex­
perim
ent both for myfelf and others, and have never known it to fail.
The rules arethefe : If you would fpeak with a perfon that you have fa­
m
iliar and,conftajxt dealjngs wijlx^but no way related, take the feventh
houfe andhis lord to fignify him, that is, the feventh fromtheafeendant;
for the afeendant always iignifies the querent. If the lord of the le-
venth be inany of the four angles, viz. in the firft, fourth, feventh, or
tenth, houfes, the perfon you would fpeak with is certainly at hom
e. If
the lord of the feventh be in any of the fuccedent houfes, viz. in the fe­
cond, fifth, eighth, or eleventh, he is not then at hom
e, but is n
ear it,
andm
ay with a little diligence be found ; but if the lord of the feventh
be in any one of the cadent houfes, viz. the third, fixth, ninth, or
twelfth, the party is far from hom
e, an
d confequently cannot be lpoken
with if fought for. If the lord of the afeendant apply to the lord of the
feventh*.by afriendly afpedt at the tim
e of enquiry, the querent m
ay per­
haps m
eet the quefited, or accidentally hear of him by the way. Or, if
the Moon orany other pUnci transfer the light of the lord of the_feyenth
to the lord of the afeendant, it denotes the fam
e thing. The nature and
fex of the planet transferring the light denotes what m
anner of p
terio
n
ihall give notice to the querent of the perfon he enquires after, accord­
in
g*
A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
*9 4
ing to the fign and quarter he is pofited in. But, if the ptfrfon enqui­
red after be a relation, then the lordof the feventh is not to be taken,
but the lord of that houfe which fignifies fuch relation; as, if it bea
brother, then the lordof the third m
uft be referred to ; if a father, re­
gardmud be'had to the lordof thefourth ; if a fon or daughter, obferve
thelord of the fifth, andfo on* and, accordingto their pofitions, judge as
above fpecified.
I f the Party long abfent be dead or altve.
Herein alfo m
uft be confidered what relation the querent hath to the
party quefited, andtake the fignificatoraccordingly. But, if therebe no
relation between them
, then take the afcendant, his lord, andthe Moon,
to fignify the party that is abfent; andjudge thus : If the lord of the
afcendant, or the Moon, be in conjundtion with the lord of the eighth,
ora planet in the eighth, and no benevolent teftim
onies concur, the ab­
fent party is certainly dead. Or when the IV
foon
, and the lord of the
afcendant, ihall be in oppofition to the lord of the eighth, from the fe-
condand eighth, or fromthefixth andtwelfth, houfes, the abfent party
is likewife dead. If thelordofthe afcendant be in the fourth, and the
*
*
* —
Moon in the feventh, in quartile to him, it (hew
s great danger to the
quefited, if not abfolute death. When anevil planet (hall tranflate the
light of the lord of the eighth unto the lord of the afcendant, or of the
lord,of the afcendant to the lord of the eighth, it is moil probable the
abfent party is dead. If the Iprd of the afcendant and the Moon be in
the fourth houfe fromthe afcendant, orin the houfe of death, and cither
com
buft, orintheirfall, or joined with the lord of the eighth, the par­
ty quefited is undoubtedly deceafed; but if none of thefe pofitions hap­
pen, an
d on the contrary you find the Moon, an
d theafcendant, and its
lord, ftrongand well fortified, theabfent party is alive and well. If the
lordof the afcendant, or the Moon, feparate trom the lord of the fixth,
the abfent party hath been lately fick ; if from the lord of the eighth,
he has been indanger of death; if fromthelordof thetwelfth, he has
been in prifon, and iuffered m
uch anxiety of m
ind. And, by thus vary­
ing the rule, his condition, according to the application and feparation
of the fignificators, will be correctly found.
O f a Ship at Sea% her Safety or DeJlruSlton.
This queftion, although attributed by the ancient Arabian and Latin
aftrologers to the ninth houfe, becaufe it relates to voyages, yet the

The afcendan^and the Moojiare generally figniHcators of the..(hip,..and
the burden die bears j but the lord of the aiccadant is fignificator of the
periods that fait in her. And if in a queiiion ail thefe appear fortunate, they
denote profperity to the (hip ; but if on the contrary they are found im-
pedited and afflicted, the veuel and all in her are in imminent danger, if not
abfolutely lod. When a malevolent planet, haying dignities in the eighth
houfe, (hall be found in the afcehaant, or the lord of * ' ‘
the eighth, in evil afpe£t with tHelord of the eighth, twelfth, fixth. or
fourth, houfe, or if the Mopn he combufE under the 'earth, alT thefe are
indications o f danger, and prefage the ihip either to be lod, or in a very
defperate condition. But when all the fignificators are free, and no way
impedited, it denotes the (hip to be in a very good and profperous con­
dition, and all the perfons and things on board her. I f the afeendant and
the Moon be unfortunate, and the lord of the afeendant d u n g , and in a
good houIeTTf indicates the (hip to be in an ill condition ; but the men,
& c. that are on board her, w ill do well, and come home in fafety. But
if the afeendant and the Mopn (hall be fwtunate, and the lord of the af­
eendant unfortunate j it (hews that the veil'd will do well, or that it is in
fafety~j but that her crew are in great danger of being deftroyed by fome
putrid difeafe, or of being taken by an enemy.
I f .any perfon enquires what fuccefs a (hip (hall have in her voyage
upon her fetting fail, you mull then note the angles of the figure ; and
if the fortunate planets and the Moon (for (he is lady of the feas) are
found therein, and the unfortunate* planets cadent, or in an abic£t con­
dition, it forelhews the (hip and her lading will go very fafely unto the
intended haven. But if the infortunes be in angles, or in fuccedent
houfes, (he w ill meet with fome accident in her voyage ; and the mis­
fortune w ill fall upon that part of the (hip, perfon, or thing in the fame,

tune threatening this danger ihall be Saturn, the veffel will either be
lplit orfunk, and m
oil of thecrew either drowned, or fubjedt to m
any
hardihips. But if the infortune be M
ars, and he in any of his effeutial
dignities, or afpeding a place where he hath ftrength, or pofited in an
earthy fign, he portends thefam
e m
ifehief, with theadditional m
isfortune
of the crewbeing either taken by an enem
y, im
prifoned, or carried into
flavery. But if the fortunes caft their friendly beam
s unto either of the
aforeiaid places, andthe lordsof the angles, particularly of the afeendant
and the dilpofitor of the M
oon befree, it denotesithat, although the ihip
ihall undergo m
uchdam
age, or be loft, yet the m
ajor part of the m
en and
goods (hall be faved. But if M
ars afflidt the lords of the angles, and dif-
pofitor of the Moon, the m
en an
d the ihip will be in danger of pirates,
or of a public enem
y. And, if anyother evil affed
ti'on
sappearinthe figns,
there will be quarrelling an
d contention, or fom
e dangerous mutiny, in
the (hip ; and this will chiefly happen whenthe infortunes are locatedin
thofe figns which difpofe of the parts in the upper divifion of the ihip.
But, if Saturn afflidl in the fam
e m
anner a
s above recited of M
ars, there
will bem
any difturbanccs in the ihip, but no bloodihed. And, if the in­
fortunate figns fignify the bottom or lower part of the ihip, it prefages
drowning by m
eans offom
edangerous leak. If fiery figns bein the mid­
heaven, near violent fixed ftars,^and M

e a^fting planet, the
ihip wTTl^e^urntV

with an enem

dthedangerwill begin in that part of theihip fignified
by the fign w
herein the infortune w
as placed inthe figure. If Saturn be
the threatening planet inftead of Mars, and pofited in the mid-heaven,
the vefiel will be caft away, or dam
aged by the m
otion of violent ftorm
s
an
d winds, or by reafon of leaks, or bad fails ; and the danger will be
either greater or lefs, in proportion to the dignity or power of the infor­
tune, and hisdiftancefrom thebeam
s of the benevolent planets.
If the lord of the afeendant in the figure be fortunate, the ihip ihall
return with fafetyan
d good fuccefs ; but, if he be unfortunate, ihc ihall
fuftcr m
uch lofs an
d dam

tV' the lordof the afeendant; orif the lord of‘the. afeendantbe in the
eighth, it denotes the death of thecapuin^r m
ailer of the ihip7 or fom
e
of the principal officers belonging to her. And if the Part of Fortune
an
d p
art of fubftance, and their lords, ihall be afflifted, it denotes lofs
inthe fale of the goods that a

tion, they ihall b

profitable

profitable voyage. When the lord of the afccndantj and the dilpofitor

oreparticularly if the lords of thofe places

there be enmity in the pofitions betw

QUESTIONS proper to the SECOND HOUSE.
The fefco
n
d houfe being the houfe of fubftance, the queftions properto
it are asfollow:
1. Shall the Querent be rich or poor ?
2. By w hat M eans Jhall he attain riches ? *
3. The Time w hen?
4. Shall he obtain the Goods or Money lent ?
5. Shall be obtain the W ages orJlipend due to him ?
Shall the Querent be rich or poor ?
In refolving this queftion, obferve the fign of the fécond houfe and his
lord^-the planet or planetsJtoratedjhjyrefn, and catting their rays to the
cufp, or thelord thereoFTthe part of fortune alfo, andits difboijtor ; and,
if all thefe fignificators are free, and aflifted by the bodies or afpedts of
the benevolent planets, the querent will attain a very confidcrable for­
tune ; and ihall efcape poverty.- But when the fignificators .are afflided,
and the fortunateftarsafford them no affiftance, it denotes the perfon in-
terrogating'wÏÏThe poor alXhis life-time. If the lord of the afcendant,
or the Moon, bejoined to the lord of the houfe of fubftance; or the lord
of the fçyenrlüxau£çj&the lord of the afcendant ; or if the lord of the
houfe of fubftance be pofited in the afcendant ; or if the lord of the af­
cendant, and the Moon, be in the houfe of fubftance; or if the Moon,
or
*gg a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
or any other planet, transfer the light of the lord of the fecond houfe to
the lord of theafcendant, or of the lord of the afeendant to the lord of
the fecond houfe; thequerent will attain riches, and live ingood efteem
,
according to his fituation or birth. But, if none of thefe pofitions hap­
pen, thennote Jupiter, the natural fignificator of fubftance; orJTenug,
who alfo is a fortune; or the Dragon’s head, which always portends
good; andif they be free fromtheill beam
sof the infortunes, orhappen
to be pofited inthe houfe of fubftance, the querent will m
oft certainlybe
rich, and will bear great fway in the placew
herehelives. WhenSaturn,
Mars, or the Dragon’s tail, are pofited in the fecondhoufe, or affiidt the
lord of the fecond, Jupiter, Venus, or part of fortune, it is an argum
ent
that thequerent will not attainriches; or, if hew
ere in agood capacity,
he will be reduced to a very m
ean fituation. The fignificators of fub­
ftance fwift inm
otion, and in good parts"o
f the figure, and free from af­
fliction, (hew the querent will he rich of a fudden; but, if they are(low
in m
otion, though not affli&ed, the querent will attain riches but (low
­
ly; particularly if the planets fignifying riches are ponderous, and in
fixed figns.
By what Means Jhall the Querent attain Riches t
The fignificators of fubftance, their feveral locations, and the houfes
they govern, are in this queftion to be particularly attended to; for
from thence is known by what m
eans riches com
e. If the lord of the
fecond houfe, or theother fignificators of fubftance, befortunately placed
in the afcendant, the querent will attain great riches withbuTiimcfi .la­
bour, ifi am
anner unexpedledly ; but, if the lord.of the fecond be in the
fecond, it (hew
s the querent will obtain an eftatc by his own induftry.
The adjuvant planets fituated in the afcendant, or the lordthereof, denote
thequerent will advancehimfelfby his own induftry. If the lord of the
fecond be in the fecond, he acquires wealth by m
erchandize, and by
properly m
anaging his bufinefs; if in the third, or lord of the third, he
gains by brethren, kindred, or neighbours. The m
oft alluredteftim
onies
upon queftions of this nature, arethefe: If thelordof thefirftandfecond,
and Jupiter, be in conjun&ion either in the fecond, firft, tenth, fourth,
feventh, or eleventh, houfes; or if they apply by fextile or trine to each
other with m
utual reception; but if theyapply by quartile or oppofition,
with reception, the party will then alfothrive, an
d have an eftafe, though
with m
uchlabouranddifficulty. .
The Time when a M an may attain Riches f
Conlider ferioufly the application of the Moon, or lordof the aicen-
dant, unto the planet orplanets fignifying the fubftance of the querent*

for they denote the tim

find the degrees of diftance betw
een the fignificators, and turn them
into tim

the goods of fortune, areattainable by the querent. FixedJigns prolong
the bufinefs; but corporal ihew an indifferency, or that the "tim
e will
neither be long nor ihort. Moveable or cardinal fign
s haftenthe m
atter.
In all queftions that relate to tim
e, the fureft way is,‘to take tlie right or
oblique afcenfions of the iigni£cators, and direti them to their fevcral
prom
ittors, a
s in a nativity; and thus the tim
e of a m
an’s obtaining
riches m
aybeexadllyknown; hut, if thequeftion beoffm
all confequencc,
obferve the degrees of diftance; and, according to the figns they are in,
m
eafure out the tim
e in years, m
onths, weeks, or days, a
s before
directed.
Shall the Querent obtain the Goods or Money lent ?
In this queftion the lord of the afeendant, and the Moon, are figni-
ficators of the querent; an
d the lordof the fecond denotes his fubftancc.
But the feventh houfe and its lord reprefent the perfon of whom you
enquire; andthe eighth houfe, and the lord thereof, his fubftancc. Ob­
ferve whether the lord of the afeendant or the Moon be joined to the
lord of theeighth, who is fignificator of the fubftance of the party en­
quired after; for if either of thembejoined to, or in good afp
ed
bwith, a
planet in the eighth houfe, and the planet therein happens to be a benefic
ftar, the querent ihall then obtain the goods or 'm
oney enquired after.
And if it ihall fo happen, that an infortune be either in the eighth houfe,
or lord of the eighth, and receives either the lord of theafeendant or the
Moon, the perfon enquiring ihall obtain what he expedís. But not
without reception. When the lord of the eighth is pofitedinthe firft o
r
fecond houfe, and the lordof the fecond ihall receive him, it denotes the
perfeflion of the bufinefs enquiredafter. But, if the lord of the feventh
or eighth ihall be pofited in the firft or fecond, and be not received by
either the lord of the afeendant, the Moon, or lord of the fecond, it
ihews the querent will not only go without his defire, but, if he purfues
the bufinefs, will fuftain much lofs and detrim
ent. If the lord of the
afeendant or the Moon be joined to one of the fortunes, which have
dignity in the fign afeending, it denotes the difpatch of the bufinefs en­
quired after; or if either of them bejoined to an infortune, having dig­
nities in the afeendant, and receives the lord of the afeendant, or the
Moon, it denotes the accom
pliihm
ent of the m
atter or bufinefs enquired
after. And, if the fortunes be in powerful places of the figure, an
d
joined to the lord of the afeendant or the Moon, the m
atter or bufinefs
will be accom
pliihed, although there be no reception. ‘

Shall the'Q uerent and bis Brethren, & c . or Neighbours, accord?
The Moon, the afeendant, and its lord, are the fignificators of the
querentj and thethird houfe, andits lord, of the quefited. The queftion
is refolved thus: If the lord of the third houfe be a benevolent planer,
and
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 301
and in the afcendant, or the Moon be in good afpcC
t with a fortunate
planet in the third, the querent an
d his brethren and neighbours will
agree well. W
hen the lord of the afcendant an
d lord of the third are in
fextile or trine to each other, and in m
utual reception; or the lordof the
third calls a fextileor trine to the cufp of the afcendant; and the lord of
the afcendant or the M
oon calls the fam
e to the cufp of the thirdTioufc;
it is an argum
ent ofgreat unity, love, andconcord, betw
een them
. When
a fortunate planet is in the afcendant, and the lord,.of,the afcendant be­
holds the cufp of the third, or applies friendly to the lord oFthe third, it
is a
n argum
ent ofagooddirpofitioninthequerent, andfpeaks himwilling
to accord with his brethren, kindred, an
dneighbours. And if afortune
bein the third, an
d the lordof the third apply in harm
ony to the lord of
theafcendant, the brethren, kindred, or neighbours, are m
oll indulging.
Thofe perfons whofe fignificators do not apply are m
oll im
perious, a
rid
apt todifagree; and thofe, w
hofe fignificators m
ake application, areflexi­
ble, willing, and yielding, an
ddelirous of agreem
ent an
dconcord. When
Saturn, M
ars, or the Dragon’s tail, in fuch a quellion, H
ull be in the
afcendant, it denotes the perfon enquiring to be obilinate, an
d averfe
to a friendly agreem
ent; but if they, or cither of them
, are pofited in
the third houfe, thebrethren, neighbours, and kindred, a
reof am
alicious
difpofition. And, if it happens that Saturn or M
ars be peregrine, re­
trograde, or combuil, the m
alice and mifehief they threaten will be the
m
ore dangerous. When Saturn or the Dragon’s head are in thethird,
the neighbours are obilinate, and the kindred covetous and lparing. If
M
ars, thekindred are treacherous, and the neighbours dilhonelt. And
this is m
ore certain, when they are out of theirefiential dignities.
O f the Condition and Eftate o f an abfent Brother ?
To refolve this quellion, conlider the lord of the third houfe, for that
hathfignificationofbrethren; and the houfe w
here he is pofited, becaufe
that Ihew
s the ftateandcondition of the quefited. For if the lord of the
thiid be in conjunction, quartile, or oppolition, of the infortuncs, or in
evil afpeC
t of the lords of theobfeure houfes, thecondition of the brother
is forrowful; but if on the contrary he be in good afpeC
t with the for­
tunes, and in propitious places of the figure, his condition is good and
profperous. If the lordof the'third-bepofitedin

afpett of the m
alevolents, the brother that is abfent H
ath an intention
to enrich himfelf in the place w
here he is; for the fourth houfe is the
fecond from the third. If the lord of the third be pofited in the fifth,
in
of thefortunes, it Ihew
s the abfent brother to be inhealthandvery happi­
ly fituated. But ifthelordofthe thirdhoufe beinthe fifth, voidofcourie,

r in corporal conjunflion, or m
alicious afpeft of the infortunes, and
this without reception, an
d the unfortunate planets them
felves im­
peded, it declares the abfent brother in a bad condition, indifpofed in
health, an
d not contented in the place w
here he is. But if he be found
inany of the obfeurej^arts ofthejigure, which are naturallyevil, a
s the
fi\th, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, the abfent brother is not well, nor in
aprofperous fituation. When the loxd^of thejhird isfound intheeighth»
cither in conjunction, Textile or trine, of one of the fortunes, the abfent
brother is not well ; or if the lord of the third bejoined to evil planets
in the fixth houle, or in conjutlion with the lord of the fixtb, lie is
then in an infirmand fickly condition ; and if the lordof the fixth be in
thethird, except the lord of the third be well difpofed, it denotes "tH
e
fam
e. Then note whether the lord of the th
ird
_
b
.e in conjunftion^with
the lord of-ti*e eighth, or in combuilion; for fuch aconfiguration de­
clares he will die of theinfirm
ity. But, if the lord of the third be in the
fiventh, the brother is in the fam
e country he went intoat firft, an
d con­
tinues there ; an
dhis condition is neither well nor ill. If the fignificator
be in the eighth, the abfent brother is in danger of death, particularly
it he b
e com
buft, or in conjunction with the lord of the eighth, in con-
iundion or afpcCt of the infortunes; for thefe are ilrong argum
ents of
death. When the lordof the third is in the ninth, it denotes that the
abfent brother is rem
oved from the place he firft went to, an
d is gone
into am
ore rem
otecountry. And if he be in the tenth, in conjunction
or good alpc\t of the fortunate planets, and with reception, it denotes
him to have acquired fom
e honour, office, or preferm
ent, in the place
w
here he lives. But if he be in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,
of the infortuncs, com
buft, or any other way infortunated, it is to be
fen
red the abfent brother is dead. If the lord of the third be in the
eleventh houfe, in conjunction, Textile, or trine, of the fortunes, or in
conjunction with the lord of the eleventh, it denotes the abfent brother
to b
e at the houle or place of fom
e friend, w
here he is-happy and well;
but, if he be m
alicioufly beheld of the unfortunate planets, he is not
plealed with the fituation he is in, but is grieved an
d perplexed. The
fignificator of the abfent party, in the twelfth houfe, in conjunction or
good afpcC
t of the fortunes with reception, an
d the fortunes them
felves
no w
ay im
peded, fhews he will deal in m
erchandize, and gain riches.
But, if he be infortunated in thetwelfth houfe, either by the bad afpeC
ts
of them
alevolents, or by the lordoftheeighth, orincombuilion, it (hew
s
the abfent brother to be difeontented, troubled, an

Shall the Querent's inland Journeys be prosperous.
Perfons who travel much in the country w
here they live, andhave not
their nativities.to dire6i them
, m
ay have occafion to enquire the event of
fom
eintendedjourney; for we know thofe that travel m
uch do not al­
ways travel fafe; but fom
etim
es are in danger either of thieves, ficknefs,
oraccidents, upontheirjourneys, that m
ay occafion themtorepent the un­
dertaking of them
. Now, for the preventionof fuch accidents, andto en­
able the reader to refolve queftions of this nature, let the following rules
beobferved : Give the afeendant and his lord, an
dthe Moon, to the que­
rent; the thirdhoufe and lord thereof to fignify thejourney ; an
d if the
fignificators be fwift in m
otion, orin the eflential dignities ofeach other,
or in conjunftion, retffile, or trine, to each other, in good places of the
figure; the journey will be good and profperous. Or if the M
oon be
in the third, in Textile to the afeendant, or the lord of the third caft a
Textile or trine to the afeendant, or be in the fame; and the lord of the
afeendant well dignified, in the third, they alfo denote a fafe and plea-
fantjourney. If the lord of the afeendant or Moon apply to any planet
in the third houfe, or the lord of the third to a planet in the afeen­
dant, it likewife denotes thejourney enquired after to be pleafant. Or,
if Jupiter or Venus be in the third houfe, it fhews a profitable and de­
lightful journey ; particularly if they caft a fextile to the afeendant. The
Dragon's tail in the third houfe, fhews the fam
e. When Saturn, Mars,
or the Dragon’s head, are pofited in the third houfe, or afflid the lord
thereof, or the Moon, it portends anunluckyjourney to the querent, and
very ill fuccefs therein. Saturn fhew
s the querent to be m
elancholy and
penfive in hisjourney; M
ars and the Dragon’s head fhews him to be in
danger of thieves and robbers; and, if they are in huraatl figns, or fiery,
it denotes himto be lam
ed or wounded in his journey. When the lord
of the afeendant is.retrograde, the querent will return again before he
hath gone to the place he interidetT; and, if the fignificators be flow, he
m
akes but little haftc or fpeed in his journey. Ifth#-lord of the fixth
afflift the^%nifi.catorst the querent will fall fick by the w
ayfTfltieTord
of the twelfth, he will be im
pededby m
alicious people; and, if the lord

Reports and Rumours, whether true or fa lfe-
This queftion m
ay beanfw
ered thus: Obferve the lord of the afeen­
dant and the Moon, and the difpolitor of the Moon, and fee if either of
thembe in an angleor fuccedent houfe ina fixed fign, or ingood afpedl
with Jupiter, the Sun, or Venus; for ufually, upon fuch configurations,

the reports and rum
ours are true. But if the lord of the afcendant or
the M
oon be afflifted of Saturn or M
ars, or cadent from an angle, al­
though they be ftrong inthefign where they are, yet the rum
our is falfe.
R u m o u r s arc alfo true and good when the angles of the figure are fixed
lig n s , an
d the Moon an
d Mercury infixed figns, feparating from the in­
fo rtu n e s , and applying to a fortune pofited in any of the angles of the
figure. So alfo when theangles of the tenth and fourth houfes are fixed,
and the Moon (hall be received in either of them
, although the rum
ours
and reports be of a
n evil nature, yet they will hold true. If the fortu­
nate planets Jupiter and Venus (hall be in the afcendant, and the Moon
at the fam
e tim
e unfortunate, let the rum
ours or reports be ever fo mif-
chievous and unlucky, they will be fureto prove falfe, and com
e to no­
thing. Mercury being retrograde or otherways afflidtcd, declares ill Tu­
rnouts to be falfe; the like doth the afH
idtion of that planet to whom
Mercury or the Moon applies. If thelord of the afcendantor the Moon
lhall be under the Sun beam
s, the truth of the rum
our is kept fecret by
m
en in power, and few (hall know the truth thereof. If the Moon be
void of courfe, or in quartile or oppofition of Mercury, and neither of
them call their fexile or trine afpedts to the afcendant, the news or ru^
m
our is vain andfalfe, and m
ay be fafely contradifitcd.

JUDGMENTS proper to the FOURTH HOUSE.
The fourth houfe gives judgment onpofieifions, inheritances, lands, or

qucftions proper to it, viz.

O F A S T R O L O G Y ;
5. Is there Treafure hidden in the Placefuppofed ?
6. Shall the Querent enjoy the EJlate o f bis Father ?
Thefe queftions, being once refolved, will lead the artift to the under-
{landing of any thing of the like nature.
Shall the Querent purchafe the Houfe or L an d defred?
To refolve this queftion, give theafcendant and his lord, an
dthe Moon,
to fignify him that enquires; the fign of the fourth houfe an
d lord
thereof to fignify the thing quefjted. If the lordoftheafcendant, or the
Moon, be in the fourth houfe, or the lordof the fourth in the firil, or if
either of them are in conjunction with the lord of the fourth, or infextile
or trine to him with reception, it declares the accom
pliihm
ent of the
thing without im
pedim
ent or hindrance. But if they arejoined without
reception, or in quartile or oppoiition with perfect reception, the que­
rent m
ay poflibly obtain his defire. Or if the fignificators be not joined
together, either by bodyor afpeft, yet, if there bea tranflationof light be­
tween them
, either by the Moon, or another planet, it (hew
s apoflibility
of thepurchafe, though with much difficulty and trouble.
The following is alfo agood m
ethod to judge of this queftion. Give
the fign afeending, and the lord thereof, and the planet from whom the
Moon is feparated, to the querent or purchafer; the feventh houfe and
his lord, the planet or planets pofited therein, and the Moon, to fignify
the thing to be bought or purchafed; and the m
id-heaven to fignify the
price thereof. And if in your figure thelord of the afcendant behold the
lord of the feventh, and the lord of the feventh apply to the lord of the
afcendant, the fellerhatha great defire to deal with the Buyer; andif they
chance to bein each others dignities, orany good tranflationof light hap­
pen betw
een them, or if they apply to corporal conjudtion, the que­
rent will agree with the feller without much difficulty or trouble.
But, if the application ortranflationof light be by quartile or oppoiition,
the buyer and feller will at laft agree; but it will be with m
uch labour
and lofs of tim
e, and after m
any probabilities of breaking off. If the
lord of the afcendant, or the Moon, apply to the lordof the fourth ; or if
thelord of the fourth, or the Moon, apply to the lord of the afcendant;
or if the lord of the fourth alone ihall apply to the lord of the afcen­
dant, an
d there bea reception betw
een them; or if the lord of the afcen­
dant, or the Moon, be in the fourth, or lord of the fourth in the afcen­
dant ; they denote the party enquiring ihall buy orpurchafe the land or
inheritance enquired after. But, if neither of thefe happen, yet, if the
Moon ihall transfer the light of one fignificator to the other, it denotes
that
t06 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
that the thing will be perfe&ed by them
ediationoffriends, orbym
eiTcn-
gers. But, if there benoapplication, reception, or tranflation of light,
between them
, then it is im
probable that any thing ihall be concluded
betw
een them
. '
O f the Quality o f the T u rchafe, and whether the Querent does w ell to take it?
Take the fourth houfe to refolve this interrogatory; andif the two
unfortunate planets arc polited therein, either potent or peregrine, the
thing enquired after will be w
afted by the buyerj and at prefent is in no
very good condition. If the lord of the fourth be infortunated, either
by retrogradation, detrim
ent, fall, or peregrination, it denotes the houfe
or land to be bad. or fo encum
bered that it will never continue long
with the purchafer» But if the fortunateplanets, or the Dragon’stail, be
in the fourth houfe, it lhews the bufinefs enquired after tobe good* and
the buyer or purchafer ihall be againer thereby. When the fortunate
planets caft their benevolent rays unto the fourth houfe, and the lord of
the fourth ihall be poiited in a good houfe, in Textile or trine to the fe-
cond houfe or his lord, it is anargum
ent that the bargain is good, and
the purchafer (hall beagainer thereby. If Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, be
upon the cufpofthe fourthhoufe, it denotesa
neftatetobehilly, hard,and
dry. If Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, the land is level, and very good.
If Gemini, Libra, or Aquaries, the ground is T
om
e part high and fom
e
low $ and isinquality neither very good nor very bad. If Cancer, Scor­
pio, or Pifces it abounds with much water. An unfortunate planet in
the fourth, retrograde, (hew
s the land or houfe will turn out very un- *
lucky, and not be worth the taking, and will be accom
panied with m
any
infelicities; but if afortunate planet be poiited there ftrong, the land is
good, and m
ay well invite thequerent to go on, for he will have a good
Bargain. ,
I f b ejl fo r a Terfon to remove, or abide where be is?
In this queftion give the afeendant and the lord thereof to fignify
the querent; the feventh houfe and lord thereof, to fignify the place
to which he would go; the fourth houfe and his lord, the fubftancc of
the querent ; and the tenth houfe and his lord, the profit of rem
oval.
The lord of the afeendant or fourth in the feventh, añd the lord of the
afeen d an t andfeventh, fortunateplanets, fwift in m
otion, ftrong and po­
tent w
herethey arc, the querent then will do well to rem
ainwhere he is,
and not rem
ove. But if the lord of the feventh be with a good planet,
and the lords of theafeendant or fourthwithanevil one, the q
u

better rem
ove, for he will get little by continuing where he is. Fortu-

nate planets in the afcendant or fourth m
ay invite the querent to rem
ain
where he is. If the lords of thofe houfes are in conjunction or in good
afpeft with fortunate ilars, it denotes the fam
e. Unfortunate planets
in the afcendant or fourth ihew the querent it is good to rem
ove 5 and
if the lords of the afcendant and fourth be afflidted by the m
alefics,
either by body or afpeft, it denotes the fam
e. Obferve the afflicting
planet or planets* and the houfe or houfes they govern, for from thence
the occafion of the mifehief that the querent fuftains is known; th
e*
like obferve of the affifting orfriendlyplanets*whence arational anfw
erto
the queftionpropofed will be eaiily obtained.
O f treafures bid% whether attainable or not ?
It is not uncom
m
on for penurious perfons to hide treafure in their
life-time, and to go out of the world without inform
ing their heirs or
executors where to find it. W
henever this is fufpe&ed to be the cafe*
and a queilion is grounded upon it, erect your figure, and confider what
application, reception, tranilation, &c. there m
ay be between the lords
of the afcendant an
d fourth houfe. If there be a friendly application
andreception, the perfon enquiring (hall obtain the treafure he enquires
after; but, if there be a quartile or oppofition between the fignificators,
without the reception, the treafure will rarely be found. When
the fignificators apply to each other corporally in a fixed fign, there are
great hopes of finding and obtaining the fam
e fpeedily; particularly
if the application be inagoodhoufe. Both oreitherofthe lum
inaries in
the afcendant no way unfortunate, or friendly beholding the fam
e,
argues a fpeedy recovery of the treafure hid$ but, if they ihould
happen to be cadent, or in quartile or oppofition thereto, it gives
but fm
ali hopes. If the part of fortune be in the afcendant, beheld
by fortunate planets, or by the lum
inaries, the querent will have a
fair profpefcl of acquiring his wifhes ; but, if the part of fortune and
t^e lum
inaries be cadent, particularly the Moon ; and neither of the
lights caft afriendly afpeft to the part of fortune, or to the afcendant;
nor the lord of the afcendant beholding the afcendant; it is an argum
ent
that the querent will notobtain the treafure hid. I always find, inquef-
tions of this nature, when fortunatejplanets are in
» the fourth, or
govern the fourth, that there is treafure; and, if the lord of the af­
cendant, or the Moon, be in good afpedl with thofe planets, the que­
rent generally attains it by diligent fearch. But, on the contrary,
if infortunes be in the fourth houle, or the lum
inaries weak therein, it
is an argum
ent of irrecoverv; or ihews that it h
as been taken away
before. * •

A queftion being thus in agen

the fourth houfe, an
d the planet or planets pofited therein, will fignify

re enquired after. W
hen Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's
head, are in the fourth houfe, they declare the treafure to he in the
place fuppofed; and, if they be in their eflential dignities, it is very
certain that there is great value there. Or if any of the other planets
aie pofited in their ow
n houfes, or in the fourth houfe without im
pedi­
m
ent, it ihew
s that there is treafu
re in the place fuppofed. But if the

Shall the Querent enjoy the Fjlatc o f his Father ?
This queftion is oftentim
es of great im

therefore ought to be contem
plated with m
ore than ufual acutenefs. If

utual dignities ¿T each
ether; or the lo

^of the fécond in the fifth, or the lord of the fifth in

lord of the fifth houfe be retrograde, or afflidedby fo
rn
e m
alevolent pla­
net, it prtfagesthat m
uch of the eftatewhich the querent's father intend­
ed for him will be w

hen thelord of

tran
slation; o
r they, or cither of them
, happen tob
e pofited in the fifth

an enquiring is with child. And, w

tors apply friendly, or a

d infruitful houfes
alio, a
s the fifth, eleventh, an
d feventh, the party enquiring is with

net with reception in a
nangle, an

Jupiter, the natural fignificator of children, in the afeendant, fifth, fe­
venth, oreleventh, houfes, n
o w

querent tobe with child. But, if Jupiter be affiidted, orcadent, thewo­

To anfw
er this queftion, obferve the afeendant, an

dplanet towhich

Confider the fign upon the afeendant, an

here the lord thereof is
pefited, an
d w
hat fign is upon the cufp of the fifth houfe; for, if the
fignificators a
re in bicorporal or double-bodied figns, the querent will
very probably have tw
o children. If Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's
head, b
e in afruitful fign, either in the fifth or afeendant, it is pofiiblc
for the querent to have three children; particularly if the M
oon lends
her afliftance. But, if thefe planets a
re not polited in the afeendant, or
fifth houfe; yet, if they cail their friendly rays to either of them
, it is
zn argum
ent that the querent will have tw
ins. But, if fixed figns, o

m
oveable, poffefs the cufps of the afeendant or fifth houfe, an
d the Sun
or M

ent that the w

fions, &c. to the degree of the fifth houfe or its lord, or to Jupiter, or
to his good afperts; and bv allowing a day to each degree of diftance, the
time ot birth will be nearly found. This is difcovcred by confidering
what direilion or tranfit there may be either to the fifth houfe, or to Ju­
piter, Venus, or the Moon, for at that time the woman may be delivered ;
particu^rly if the true tranfit or diredtion falls in the fifth, eleventh, op
afeendant.
O f a MeJJengerfen t on an Embafj'y> or on any important Bujinefs.
When this queilion is propofed, give the afeendant and its lord to
m thatYent the meflenger; the feventh houfe and its lord, to fignify
him to whom the meflenger is fent; and let the Moon fignify the mef-
fa^e itfelf ; and the lord of the fifth the ijieffenger, and Tus management
g of the bufinefs. When the lord of the fifth houfe ihall fepa-
rate irom the lord of the feventh, and apply to the lord of the afeendant,
then judge the meflenger hath effedled his bufinefs, and is returning again,.
And, if he feparates from the lord of the fecond, he then brings money
with him, let the fignificator of that houfe be either a fortunate or infor­
tune. If the fignificator of the meflenger feparates from fortune pla­
nets, it is an argument he has been honeft, and will bring good tidings
of the bufinefs; but, if he feparates from the malevolents, it fhews the
meflenger has done,his bufinefs lamely, or has been hindered in the per­
formance of it. If the fignificator of the meflenger applies to an infor­
tune by quartile or oppofition, and this before he can ieparate from the
lord of the feventh, it fignifies that the meflenger has met with fome
impediment in the bufinefs he went about from the party to whom he
was fent. But, if the fignificator of the meflenger (hall go to the quar­
tile or oppofition of either of the infortunes, after he is feparated from
the lord of the feventh; the meflenger will receive fome prejudice or
impediment in his way home. If there be found an infortune in the
ninth, the meflenger will not travel fafe, but will be in danger of high­
way robbery, and bodily hurt; but if, on the contrary, a benefic be in
the ninth, he will travel fafe. If the lord of the afeendant and lord of
the fifth are in reception, or in good afpeft from good places of the figure,
the meflenger is faithful, juft, and honeft ; particularly if ho be either a
fortune, or in good afpect with a fortune. But, if there be no reception or
afpect, and the configuration be with or in the dignities of an infortune,
the contrary may be expected. If there happens a reception between
the lord of the feventh and the lord of the fifth, the meflenger will be
received; and, if at the fame time the lord of the fifth or Mercury
tianflates the virtue of the lord of the feventh to the lord of the afeen-

JU DGM EN TS proper to the SIXTH HOUSE.
The fixth houfe gives judgment on ficknefs, fervants, and fmall cattle,
&c. ‘and the following queftions are commonly attributed to it : * .
1. What Part of the Body is afflifted ?
2. Is the Difeafe in the Body or Mind, or both ?
4. Shall the Diflemper be chronic or acute ?
3. What is the Caufe of the Difemper ?
5. Shall thefck Party recover, or die of the Difeafe $
6. Of Servants,Jhalltheyprovejufl, or dtfonejl ?
7 • Offnall Cattle, Jhall the Querent thrive by them or not ?
In the former part of this work, I have ihewn what difeafes arc attribu­
ted to* each planet, houfe, and iign ; which, in refolving the firft of thefe
live queftions, ihould be particularly noticed.
What Part of the Body is aflifted t
Having erefted the figure, obferve the afeendant, the fixth houfe, and
place of the Moon, for they are natural fignificators of the difeafe; and
then judge as follows: The horofeope afflitted by the prefence of an evil
planet, or by the pofition of the Dragon’s tail, indicates that the difteria
per lies chiefly in the head, and in that member or part of the body re-
prefented by the fign afeending. If the Moon be afflided by the infor­
tunes, the fick party is indifpofed in that part of the body the affliding
planet governs from his own houfe. If the afeendant be Scorpio, and
Mars and Venus be in the afeendant, or fixth houle, the difeafe lies in the
head, bowels, and fecrcts, becaufe Mars governs thofe members in either
place ; which rule holds good with all the other figns and planets.
Is the Difeafe in the Body or Mind, or in'both?
The afeendant and the difpofitors of the Sun and the Moon bear figni-
fication of the mind, and the lord of the afeendant and the Moon
of the body. Now, if the afeendant, its lord, the Sun, or the Moon,
be afHicied, it fhews the diftemper hath feized the whole body and mind
alfo of the fick party. If the afeendant and the difpofitors of the Sun
and the Moon be afflided, the difeafe impairs the mind; but, if the lord*
of the afeendant and the Moon be afflided, the difeafe affeds only the
body, and the mind is free. If Saturn afflid the afeendant, and the
difpofitor
SX
4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
di/pbfitor of the luminaries, and the Moon be at the fame time in quar­
tile or oppofition of him, or in quartile or oppofition of the lord of the
afeendant, the fick party is afflicted in mind, concerning the things of
this world, and about loiTes in his bufinefs or eftate. If Jupiter, by be­
ing lord of evil houfes, affiirt the aforefaid fignificators, the querent is
troubled in mind about religious tenets. If Venus, by difappointments
in lov^ if Mars, or Mercury, by a too intenfe excrcife of the mind, by
dudy, or by application to fcience or philofophy.
Shall the Difeafe be chronic or acute ?
To know this, confider the complexion of the perfon, his age, and the
-time of the year ; for the knowledge of thefe conduce much to the dif-
covery of the certainty of the matter propounded. Difeafes in autumn
and winter are ufually reputed chronical or long; but longer in winter
than in autumn. In fpring and fuminer, acute or lhort; but more acute
in fpring than in fummer. So infirmities affiidting young perfons, or
thofe in the firft half of their age, are ihortcr and lefs dangerous than
thofe in elderly perfons, or thofe that are in the lad part of their age.
Like wife, melancholy and phlegmatic perfons are fubjed: to chronical
difeafes; but fanguine and choleric perfons, to acute. Saturnine difeafes,
which are cold and dry, arc ufually long and tedious; the Moon and
Venus are protraders of the infirmity; Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, and
Mercury, fignify difeafes of no long continuance, but fuch as may re­
turn fpeedily; but, by being lords of evil places, or otherwife affiided,
they may have fignification of chronic difeafes. The figns pofieffing the
afeendant, fixth houfe, or place of the Moon, being fixed, declare a
chronic difeafe; common figns ihew difeafes neither very long nor very
ihort; moveable figns denote the difeafe to terminate quickly, either
one way or the other. An infortune being lord of the fixth, and in the
fixth, prefages a lading ficknefs; but, if a benefic be lord of the fixth,
and in the fixth, the difeafe will admit of an immediate cure. The lord of
the afeendant, the Moon, or lord of the fixth in conjuntlion, Textile, or
trine, of the lord of the tenth, denotes the difeafe to be of no long conti­
nuance; and if they be in conjunftion, Textile, or trine, of the fortunes,
the fame. But if the faid fignificatiors, or any of them, be in conjunc­
tion, quartile, or oppofition, of the infortunes, the difeafe will be both
long and tedious ; and, if this (hall happen in fixed figns, it argues the
duration or continuance to be dill the longer.
W hat is the Caufe o f the Dijlem per ?
The caufe of the didemper is known from the pofitionsof the fignifica-
tors of ficknefs, before deferibed, in cither of the four trigonsor triplici-
lic s ; for therein they ibew the humour that is predominant. If thefe
O F A S T R O L O G Y * v s
the moil of them are pofited in fiery figns, they declare the diftemper to
have its origin from choler, whence fevers and all fuch-like difeafes pro­
ceed. But, if the fignificators be in airy figns, blood is then predomi­
nant in the body, and the difeafe is thence caufed; as gouts, leprofics,
&c. When the fignificators of ficknefs are in earthy figns, they declare
the caufe of the difeafe to have its origin from melancholy, and thofe
difeafes are ufually long and tedious, as confumptions, agues, |cc. And
the fignificators of diieafes in watery figns denote the infirmity to pro­
ceed from cold and moift caufes, as phlegm ; and thefe difeafes principally
are coughs, phthyfic, and all difeafes of the flomach. When the pofitions
of the fignificators do not thoroughly point out the nature of the diftem-
per, note the fixed itars in the figure, and they will afllft in the difeovery
of the caufe of the difeafe.
Shall theJick Party recover, or die o f the Infirmity afilifting ?
If the Moon deflux from the infortunes, and apply to the bsnevolents
without fruilration, prohibition, or refranation, there is great hopes the
infirm party will recover ; fo the fignificators of ficknefs, no-way af-
flifred, but free from the ill beams of the malevolents, declare great
hopes of the recovery of the fick. If they are in Textile or trine of the
luminaries, or in any friendly reception with them, or either of them,
the fame. The Moon, encreafing in light and motion, and being policed
in good houfes of heaven, in Textile or trine of the lord of the afeendant,
denotes great hopes of life-; if the lord of the afeendant be an infortune
in this judgment, it will no-way affeft the fick party. When the Moon
Tjfhall either be found in the afeendant, or in any of her dignities, or ffnll
cafe a Textile or trine thereunto, it is a great argument the fick will not
die of the difeafe affliding. The lord of the afeendant and the Moon
combuil of the Sun denote death, unlefs there be fome reception be­
tween the Sun and them; and, if they (hall be in conjunction with
the lord of the eighth, except Jupiter or Venus interpofe their friendly
beams, it ihews the fame. The lord of the eighth in an angle, and the
Moon and lord of the afeendant cadent, or amiited of the infortunes,
prefage mortality; the application of the lord of the afeendant or the
Moon unto the lord of the eighth by evil afpett, ihews the fame; and,
if he be an infortune, it puts the matter pail all doubt. The lord of
the afeendant in the eighth, or lord of the eighth in the afeendant, de­
clares the irrecovery of the fick. If the lord of the eighth be in the tenth,
and the lord of the afeendant in the fourth, fixth, or feventh, houfes, any­
way afili&ed, it portends death to the fick party. The lord of the aicen-
dant and Moon with violent fixed fears, according to their latitude, ge­
nerally denote death unto the Jick.

O f Servants,Jhall they prove ju ft or dijhoneji ?
When this queftion is put by the matter, give the lord of the attendant
and the attendant itfelf to iignify the querent; the iixth houfe and its
lord to fignify the fervant. And, if the lord of the iixth commit his
difpofition by any friendly ray to the lord of the attendant, the fervant
will prove juft and honeft. If the Moon transfer the light of the lord of
the fixth to the lord of the attendant, by a good afpeCt, it fpcaks the ho-
nefty of the fervant. The lord of the iixth in the dignities of the for­
tunes in Textile or trine to the attendant, pleads for the honefty of the
fervant. If he be near fixed ftars of a benevolent nature, the fame. But
if the lord of the fixth ihall be in conjunction of the infortunes, and in
quartile or oppofition to the attendant or lord thereof, the fervant will
not prove honeft. The Moon in the fixth, in quartile to the lord of the
fixth in the fecond, ihews the fervant to be a pilferer, and.fuch a one as
the querent will never grow rich by. If the principal fignificators are
void of all reception, and there be neither good application or tranflation
of light to be found among them, the fervant is not to be trufted. When
Mercury, the natural fignificator of fervants, ihall be in the dignities of
Saturn or Mars, and in quartile *or oppofition to the attendant or fccond
houfe, or either of their lords, it gives great caufe to fufped the fervant.
If the Dragon’s tail be in the fixth, or doth affiiCt the lord of the iixth,
it denotes the fame.
O ffm all Cattle, Jhall the Querent thrive by them or not ?
By fmall cattle are meant hogs, iheep, and the like.— If the lord
of the fixth and the lord of the fecond are in conjunction, in a
good houfe of heaven, the querent may thrive by them ; or, if they be in
textile or trine, the fame. The lord of the fixth calling a friendly afpaCi
to the part of fortune, or being in good configuration with the difpofitor
thereof, denotes much good to the querent by dealing in fmall cattle.
The lord of the fixth in the fecond, in the dignities of Jupiter or Venus,
and Jupiter or Venus catting a Textile or trine to the fecond, or in the fe­
cond in conjunction with him, argues great gain to the querent by deal­
ing in fmall cattle. But if, on the contrary, the lord of the fixth be un­
fortunate, and in evil afpeCt with the lord of the attendant or fccond, or
caft malignant rays to either of their cufps, the querent will lofeby deal­
ing in fm
all cattle. If the lord of the fixth be in quartile or oppofi-
tion to the difpofitor of the part of fortune, or the Moon, the querent
cannot thrive by dealing in fmall cattle. The fame if the lord of the fixth
be afflicted cither by Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon’s tail; or be found either
retrograde, combuit, cadent, or peregrine. The Dragon’s tail and Mars
i ihew
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 3x?
(hew much lofs therein by knaves and thieves, and ill bargains, &c. and
Saturn denotes much damage by the rot or murrain.
IN TE R R O G A TO R IE S proper to the SE V E N TH HOUSE.
This houfe refolves queftions concerning marriage, partnerihip, law-
fuits, public enemies, war, &c. thefts, fugitives, and ilrays ; which, be-
caufe they are of feveral diftindt natures, are treated of under thred^liffe-
rent heads; and firft, of marriage.

2 - At what *imeJhallthe Querent marry ?
3. Shallthe Querent marry morethan once ?
4. Wbat Manner of Perfonjhall the Querent marry?
5. Shall they accord after Marriage?
6. Shall the Marriage be confummated or broken of ?
' Shallthe Querent marry ?
To know this, confider the pofition of the lord of the afeendant, the
Moon, and Venus, and the part of marriage, and their pofitions j for they
all have fignification of the party enquiring in this cafe. If all or the
greater part of them be in prolific or fruitful figns, it is a great argument
that the party enquiring will marry. If the Moon or lord of the afeen­
dant be in good afpedt with the Sun, or either of the fortunes, or near
fixed liars of their natures, the party enquiring may marry. When the
lord of the afeendant, the Moon, or Venus, are in the feventh houfe, or
in the dignities of the lord ef the feventh, and the lord of the feventh
either in the afeendant, or in fextile or trine to the faid fignificators, the
querent will certainly marry. If none of thefe arguments appear, but
on the contrary all the fignificators of marriage are in fterile figns, and
in quartile or oppofition to the lord of the feventh, or feventh houfe, the
party enquiring is averfe to marriage.
A t wbat TimeJhallthe Querent marry ?
The fignificators of marriage applying to each other by a friendly afpedt
or by conjundtion in the oriental or meridional parts of heaven, denote
the querent will be married fuddenly ; but, if in the occidental part of
heaven, or feptentrional, it will be much prolonged, and a great while
before accompliftied. All the fignificators above the earth, and fwift in
motion, accelerate or haften the matter, particularly if in moveable figns;
but, if they are under the earth, and flow in motion, the marriage will
be retarded. The degrees of diftance, either in body or afpedt, between the
‘ ’ lord

lord of the afcendfflt Jind the lord of the feventh, the Sun, or Venue,
ihew the time of marriage; if there happen a good traniit to bring on
the bufinefs. In this judgment, moveable fjgns give weeks or days; bi­
corporal give months or weeks; and fixed figns yeap? or months: and,
if the fignificators are flow in motion, and in fixed figns, the degrees of
diftance will be fo many years; if fwift in motion, then fo many months;
Jie de cateris.
Shall the Querent m arry more than once ?
The fignificators of marriage in bi-corporal or double-bodied figns de­
clare the querent, be it either man or woman, to marry more than once.
The fignificators of marriage in conjunction, Textile, or trine, with many
planets, portend marriage to the querent more than once; particularly
from the fifth, feventh, or eleventh, houfes. Many planets in the feventh
houfe, in Textile or trine to the luminaries or lord of the afeendant, denote
the querent will be married more than once. But, if the fignificators of
marriage are in fixed figns, and in afpedt with not above one planet, it
prefages that the querent will mafry only once.
*

%
■ Obicrve wbat planet the lord of the afeendant, or Moon, is neareft in
afpeft with, and the iign he is in, and deferibe the perfon, either man
or woman, accordingly ; for fuch a one the querent will marry. If the
lord of the afeendant or Moon be in conjunction or afpe& with Venus,
the perfon is pleafant and affable; if with the Sun, he is noble, of a
great fpirit, and imperious ; if with Mars, the perfon is many times rafh
and furious, and fubjeCt to choler and pailion ; if with Saturn, he is in­
clinable to melancholy, but prudent and grave; if with Jupiter, the
perfon is juft, honeft, and religious ; if with Venus, fubtil, cunning,
&c. Note the fixed ftars that are near the fignificators, for they often
alter the quality of the planets. By thus coniidering the dignities and
debilities of the planet or planets aforefaid, the fhape, qualification, and
temperature, of the perfon whom the querent fhall marry may be
known and difeovered.
S ta ll they accord and be happy after M arriage ?
The lord of the afeendant, or Moon, in conjunction,' fextile, or trine,
of the lord of the feventh or Venus, argues much pleafure and delight
after marriage, and fhews the parties fhall agree well, and not quarrel;
but, if they are in quartile or oppoiition unto each other, it fhews much
quarrelling

quarrelling and contention after marriage; and* if they be in quartile,
conjunction, or oppofition, of the infortunes, irt any places of the figure,
it ihews the fame. Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon's tail, in the afcendant,
(hews the querent to be imperious after marriage, and by his or her
obftinacy will occafion much difeontent and trouble. But, if they are
pofited in the feventh houfe, the perfon whom the querent marries
will be the occafion of the trouble and difeontent. Benevolent planets
pofleffing the feventh houfe, and a friendly reception between the lord
of the feventh and lord of the afcendant, denote good agreement after
marriage. If there happens to be a reception, through they are in
quartile, it implies the fame.

Shall the Marriage be effcSled, or broken of ?
The perfon, who enquires concerning the concluding or breaking off
an intended marriage, muit have the lord of the afcendant and moon for
iignificators ; and the perfon quefited mull have the lord of the feventh
and the planet from which the Moon is feparated. If the lord of the af­
cendant or Moon be joined to the lord of the feventh, or in fextile or
trine to him, in any of his efiential dignities, the marriage intended
will be brought to perfection, particularly if it be from good houfes of
the figure. If a quartile or oppofition happens between the fignifica-
tors, and no reception, the intended marriage will be broken off, and
come to nothing. When there is no afpeCt between the iignificators,
yet, if there be any good tranflation of light between them, and this by
a benevolent planet, the marriage may be effected by a perfon reprefented
by the houfe that planet is lord or governor of. So alfo, if the figni-
ficator of both parties apply to a friendly afpeCt, and, before the alpett
be made, an infortune interpofes his malicious rays, the marriage will
be obftrufied by a perfon fignified by the houfe the interpofing planet
is lord of. If the interpofing planet be lord of the third, a kiniman of
the querent’s, or a neighbour or brother, ihall break off the bufinefs ;
if he be lord of the tenth or fourth houfes, the father or mother of the
querent will obftruCt the marriage intended; and fo of the other houfes.

Shall two Partners agree and befuccefsful in their Partnerjhip 9
The lord of the afeendant and feventh, being friends according to
nature, and in reception or good afpeci with each other, declare the
partners fhall agree in their partner/hip, and gain confiderably by their
undertaking. If they are enemies by nature, and void of good
rays toward one another, and in no reception, it is an argument that
they will never agree, but will be perpetually jangling, and injuring
each other. If the lord of the afeendant be a more weighty planet than
the'lordof thefeventh, and better dignified, it (hews the querent will
thrive beft in the partnerfhip; but, if the lord of the feventh be moft
ponderous, the quefited gains moft. Mars or Mercury lord of the fe-
cond, affliiting the lord of the eighth, fhews the querent will cheat
his partner; but, if either of them be lord of the eighth,, and afflict the
lord of the fecond, the partner will cheat the querent. H*e whofe fig-
nificators are iirongeft, and in good places of the heavens, wi-11 thrive beft
in the partnerihip; but he, whofe fignificators arc weak and in eviP places
of the figure, will be injured bythe partnerfhip.
Shall the Querent, or his adverfary, overcome in a L a w *Suit ? d
If the lord of the afeendant be more potent fchan, the lord of the fe­
venth, or the afeendant better fortified than thefeventh houfe,. either by
the good nfpedts or the pretence of the fortunate planets, there is great
probability the querent will be fuccefsful in the fuit at law, and overcome
his adverfary. But, if the lord of the feventh be more powerful in digni­
ties than the lord of the afeendant, and the feventh houfe better guarded
by theprelencc or rays of the fortunate itars than the afeendant, the ad­
verfary will overcome. If the lords of the afeendant and feventh be
afflicted by the infortunes, neither party will fucceed, but both will be
injured, if they go on with the fuit. If they fliould. both be afiifted by
the fortunate planets, poifibly fome friend' will make up the breach
between them. Both fignificators in their effential dignities, and in
ancles, (hew both perfons to be too high to hearken to a reconciliation.
If they apply friendly to each other, the matter will be taken up among
themleIves ; and he, whofe fignificator doth apply, will be the firft to
nuke overtures of friendihip and peace.
«
Shall a Perfon return Jafcfrom a C ruize or Campaign ?
The lord ofthe afeendant ilrong and potent, free from the evil beims
of the infortunes, is an argument of great fecurity to the querent, and
that he (hall return 1'ufe from a cruize or campaign. If he be poiited with a
3 g°°d
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 321
good planet, in a propitious houfe, it fhews the fame. If the lord of
the afcendant be combuft or cadent, or in his peregrination, or if Mars«
be weak in the figure of the queftion, the querent will gain no honour
or reputation in the war. If the \prd of the afcendant be in afpeCt
with a good planet, and at the fame time the lord of the feventh be
with an* evil one, he may return home again ; but he will fuffer great
prejudice before his return. Saturn being in the firft, or with the lord
of the firft, prefages much lofs and damage ro the querent by war. If
Mars ihdl be with the lord of the firft, either by conjunction, quartjle*
or oppofition, and weak, and Saturn locally in the afcendant, the querent
wiH be wounded. But, if Mars or the Dragon’s tail ihould ill-dignify
the afcendant, the querent will be mortally wounded; and, it the
lord of the afcendant and the Moon fuffer affliction at the fame time,
he will be killed on the fpot. ^
Shall the City, Townr Caflle, orJlrong Hold, befieged, be taken ?
The afcendant and lord thereof repreient the befiegers, and the fourth
houfc the befieged ; the lord of the fourth, the governor > the fifth and
its lord, the ammunition, foldiery, and the afliftance they either have
or may exped. If the lord of the afcendant be ftrong and fortunate,
and joined' to the lbrd of the fourth in the afcendant, or with the Moon
or lord of the tenth houfe, in reception ; it is an argument that the
befiegers (hall prove victorious.* Or, if the lord ©
f the fourth be in
houfes not beholding the fourth, or impeded of the infortunes, it is
an argument that the garrifon will be taken, and the governor thereof
fubjeCt to danger. It the unfortunate planets, or the Dragon’s tail,
happen to be in the fourth houfe, and the fortunate planets interpofe
not theif benevolent rays, it will be taken by treachery and bafenefs in a
ftiort time. If the lord of the fourth commit his difpofition and virtue
to the lord of the afcendant, it (hews the governor has been tampered
with, and for a confederation will furrender the garrifon. But if none
of thefe afpctls- happen, and on the contrary the fourth houfe and its lord
ihall be fortunate, and free from all impediments, and the lord of the
fourth be in no reception with the lord of the firft, the garrifon, &c.
then befieged, ihall be taken by the army that inverts it.

d the M

s of the infortunes j or if
n
o infortune, n
or the Dragon’s tail, be pofited in the afeendant $ they
argue no danger to the querent, but ihewhim to beof along life. If
the faid fignificators, or either of them
, be in conjunction or good
afpeil of the fortunes, or the fortunes pofited in theafeendant, an
d the
part of life free ; they prefage the querent, according to nature, m
ay
live to aconfiderable age. Thus, finding all the fignificators free, the
querent will live a
s m
any years a
s there are degrees betw
een the con­
junction, quartile, or opposition, of the lord of the eighth houfe an
d the
lo

ricato
rs be afflicted, either by the infortunes, or by the lords of the
fourth, fixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, the querent’s life will be of no
very long continuance. In the m
eafure of tim

The lord of the eighth in the eighth, n

eighth, intheterm

dignitiesof Jupiter orVenus, a
n
d they calling their T
extile or trine af-

his wife, but alfo (hew

JU D G M EN TS proper to the N IN TH H OUSE.
We judge of voyages at fea, their profperity or infelicity j of fcience,
&c. and of perfons and things religious ; by the ninth houfe ; and thefe
quedions are the mod common unto it.
t. Shallthe Voyage be profperous or not ?
2. Will tt be long or fbort ? •
3. May the Querent profit by the Science intended?
4. Shalla Clergyman obtain the Benefice be enquires after ?
Thefe quedions properly explained and refolved will give fufficicnt
light to enable the reader to rcfolve any others, of the like nature and
import, proper to this houfe.
Shall the Voyage be profperous or not ?
When the ninth houfe or its lord ihall be unfortunately afpeQed, it
denotes many hazards and dangers to attend the voyage. If Saturn be
the afflicting planet, the perfon enquiring will be fubjedl to ficknefs,
and lofs of goods; but, if Mars or the Dragon’s tail affliét either the
ninth houfe or its lord, they declare danger by enemies or pirates. If
the ninth houfe or its lord be fortunate and drong, much good and
great fuccefs are promifed to the querent in the voyage, and that he (hall
make a happy and fafe return. The lord of the afeendant and lord of
the ninth in conjunction, fextile, or trine, with each other, particularly
if there be any reception between them, or pofitioq in each others
houl'es, argues an -admirable voyage, and a propitious and fafe return -
r
but, if they be in quartile or oppofition, void of all reception, or if
there happen no good trandation between them, the querent will have
au unauipicious voyage, and, before he returns home again, will have
rcafon to wifh he had let it alone. If the lord of the afeendant or the
Moon be in conjunction with a fortunate planet in the tenth houfe,
that being the fecond from the ninth, the querent (hall gain great (lore
of wealth by the voyage he undertakes, and enjoy remarkable health of
body. But, if the lord of the afeendant or the Mooji be in abject
places of the figure, or with the lords of abjeít houfes, or in quartile or
oppofition to them, either peregrine or combud of the Sun, the perfon
will fall fick in the journey, and the voyage will be unfortunate tó
]him j and, if they be with violent fixed liars of the fird magnitude, it
U
rill be worfe.
Will
O F A S T R 6 L O C Y,
W ill the Voyage be long or Jhort ?
The fignificators of the perfon enquiring, and of the voyage, fwift in
motion, oriental, and in moveable figns, denote the voyage to be ihort
and quick\ but, if occidental, they (hew fome obftrudtions. When
the lord of the afeendant applies to the lord of the ninth, or the lord of
the ninth to the lord of the afeendant; or if a fortunate planet transfers
the light of the one to that of the other; they are good arguments of a
fafe return, and a ihort and fpeedy voyage. The lord of the ninth in a
fixed fign, and the lord of the afeendant and Moon in fixed figns, denote
a very long voyage to the querent; if in common figns, the voyage will
be indifferently good j if in moveable figns, he returns fpeedily. If the
lord o f the afeendant be retrograde, or if either he or the Moon apply to
a planet that is retrograde, it fignifies the perfon that goes the voyage
will return home in a Ihort time, or perhaps before he goes to the place
intended. .
M ay the Querent profit by the Science intended ?
Give the afeendant, its lord, and the Moon, to fignify the querent;
the ninth houfe, the lord thereof, and the planet pofited therein, to fig­
nify the fcicnce enquired after; and, according to their pofitions and
configurations, judge of the queilion. The lord of the afeendant and
lord of the ninth in conjunftion, or in fextile or trine unto each other,
either in or from angles or fuccedent houfes, give great hopes to the
querent that he (hall gain or profit by the art or fcience he intends to
follow. If fortunate planets poffefs the afeendant or ninth houfe, and
thence (hall friendly behold either the cufps of each houfe or the lords of
them, it is an argument that the querent will profit by the art or fcience
intended. If the Moon be pofited in the ninth, in fextile to the lord
of the afeendant or ninth houfe in the eleventh, particularly if a recep­
tion happen, there is no doubt but the querent will gain by the fcience
intended, and prove a good artift thereinj but, if none of thefe things
appear in the figure, but on the contrary there happens a quartile or oppo-
fition between the fignificators, the party enquiring will not profit by the
art or fcience intended. When the unfortunate planets or Dragon’6 tail
are pofited in the afeendant or ninth houfe, or affliiit their lords, or the
Moon i or if an unfortunate planet happens to be lord of the ninth, and
pofited in an evil place of the figure j. the perfon enquiring will not gain
much by the fcience.
Shall
33® A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N
Shalla Clergyman obtain the Benefice be enquires after ?
Give the afeendant an
d its lord, an
d the M
oon, to fignify the clergy­
m
an; an
d let the ninth houfe fignify the living, or other ecclefiaftical
preferm
ent, fought after. The lord of the afeendant or M
oon, joined to
the lord of the ninth by body or good afped, gives great hopes that the
m
inifter or querent m
ay obtain the benefice defired. If the M
oon or
lord of.the afeendant be in the ninth, or lord of the ninth in the afeen­
dant, or in reception w
ith each other, they a
re very good argum
ents
that the querent o
r m
inifter (hall obtain the parfonage or church-prefer­
m
ent defired. W
hen the lord of the afeendant, or Moon, arejoined to
the Sun or Jupiter; or in fextile o
r trine of cither of them
, in the af­
eendant or ninth houfe; it den
otes that the querent will obtain the be­
neficeenquiredafter. Jf the principal fignificators be in fextile or trine,
with reception, the preferm
ent or benefice com
es with little trouble ; if
they be in
^quartile, an
dat the fam
e tim
e in reception, the benefice m
ay
be obtained, but it will be w
ith great trouble an
d delay. The bufinefs
m
ay alfo b
ebrought top
afs by tranflation of light; for, if a planet fepa-
rates im
m
ediately fromthe good afpe6l of the lord of the ninth, andap­
plies tothe lord of the afeendant; o
r if he feparates fromthe lord of the
afeendant, an
d applies tothe lord of theninth% the benefice or prefer­
m
ent will be obtained, an
d by the m
ean
s of a perfon fignified by the
planet that thus transfers the light of the fignificators to each other.—
Eut, if n
on
e of thefe teilim
onies happen, it will be avery difficult m
at­
ter to obtain the benefice defired. The lord of the afeendant retrograde,
com
buft, orcadent, an
d he or the M
oon in quartile or oppofition of the
infortunes, or of thelord of the ninth houfe, without reception, declares
thedeilrudionof them

QUESTION r. On the LENGTH of LIFE.

inclination to lay out afum of m

e
withavery prefiing folicitation to inform him w
hether his life w
ould be
long or fhort, that hem
ight thereby determ
ine whether fuch apurchafe
would be to his advantage. Not being able to procure his nativity, I
took dow
n the tim
e of the day w
hen the queftionw
as propofed, and,
having rectifiedit by a corrcdt regulator, I im
m
ediately projected the
following fchem
e.
A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
S38
.My firit buiinefs was to examine the figure, to find whether it were
radical, and fit to be adjudged, which I found to be the cafe, becaufe
the lord of the afcendant and the lord of the hour are of one nature and
triplicity ; and the fignificator of the q-uerent exa&ly defcribed his perfon,
which is of a middle ftature, fanguine complexion, and of an acute un­
demanding, denoted by Mercury's pofition in the fign Aries, the houfe
of Mars. The Moon being in oppofition to the fun, fhews himto have
a mark or fear near the left eye ; which was alfo true; and therefore, as
I found all circumftances to concur in proving the queilion to be well
and ferioufly grounded, and free from all impofition, I gave him my
judgment upon the figure as follows.
The princely fign Leo, the querent’s fignificator, occupies the afcen­
dant ; and the Sun, the lord thereof, and giver of life, is pofited near
his meridian altitude in the medium cceli, and in the fign Aries, his
houfe of exaltation, ftrong, powerful, and in full dignity, free from the
evil rays of the lords of the fixth. eighth, fourth, or fccond, houfes.
which neither impedite the Sun nor the afcendant witn any cvTlafpedt.
But the Moon, lady of the twelfth, is in oppofition to the Sun, making
at the fame time aquartile mundane afpedtwith the afcendant, and a fex-
tile afpeft with Saturn in the zodiac; from which pofitions I inferred the
following particulars.
The affliction of the lord of the afcendant, by the oppofition of the
Moon in Libra, the houfe of Venus, and Venus difpofitor of the Moon
in her own houfe, and in the feminine fign Taurus, going to a femifex-
tile with the Sun, denotes that he will receive fome considerable injury
from a female connection, now exiiling under the fpecious pretence of
friendihip anJfond attachment \ and this is declared by the Moon being
lady of the twelfth, the houfe of private enemies, which difpofes of the
part offortune, and thereby indicates that he will lofe fome part of his
fortune by her means.
The Moon’smundane quartile afpefl to the afcendant, in an airy fign.
declares.that he will be attacked with a fevere fit of the wind cholic,
or fome dangerous complaint in the bowels andreins; but it will not
prove fatal to him, becaufe the Sun, the lord ofnis afcendant, is more
ilrong and powerful, and in greater dignities, than the afflidling planets;
and therefore, according to natural efficient caufes, they will prevail over
all fubordinate effcdls.
From
O F A S T R O L O G Y . g

From aconfideration of thofe parts of the figure which relate to the
circumilances of his pail life, I informed him he had improved his for­
tune, and been fuccefsful in fome importagUeoyage, bccaufe the Dra­
gon’shead is iituated in his ninth houfe ; but that he had lately fuffercd
greatly by a violent hurricane, that threatened deilruftion ocJlupwreck$
which is denoted by the oppofition of Saturn to the part of fortune, and
the Moon having lately feparated from anoppofition with Mercury, lord
of the third houfe, where the Dragon's tail is pofited. This circum-
ilance I had the pleafure of hearing him acknowledge to be true; and
that the itormarofeonly eight days before the ihip came into port.
He requeued me to afcertain the time when the above illnefs would
happen. I accordingly took the number of degrees between the Sun and
Moon, by fubtrading the lefs fum from the greater; and found the
-distance to be eleven degrees fifty-nine minutes. I then fought the
Moon’s latitude, and found rt one degree thirty-three minutes fouth,
which, added to the above, make thirteen degrees thirty-two minutes;
and, as the fignificators are in moveable figns, I computed the time by
weeks and days, and predicted this illnefs would befal him about the
noth of July following; and that, after he Should be reilored to health
again, he would go on, without fuftaining any other ferious indifpofition.
until the fixty-trinth year of his age; about which time I conceive the
fundions of life will be naturally extinguished, by a complication of in­
firmities.
I have lately had the pleafure of converting with the gentleman on the
fubjed of this queilion. He informed me, that towards the middle of
July, 1783, he was attacked with a kind of bilious complaint in his
llomach, which brought on violent fits of the cholic. That, towards
the latter end of the fame month, he found an obilrudion in his bowels,
and his phyfician declared it next to a miracle that his life was faved.
He now appears to be in perfed health, and has funk a considerable fum
of money in life annuities, which he deques,was.done in.confequence of
the verity he found in ‘ ~

QJJESTION II. On the FATE of a SHIP at SEA,
Intheyear 17.81, a gentleman called upon me who had a considerable
¿hare in a privateer, .which had been completely fitted out and fent to
fea a long time before, and the proprietors could not obtain the leaft
information of her. He therefore requeued' me) if in my power, to give
him fome probable account of what had befallen her. After convincing
myfelf the queilion was radical, and no trick or imposition intended.
No. 17. 4 M ‘ which
4oo A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
which isalways neceflaryto be carefullyenquiredinto by the rules already
laiddown for that purpofe, I proceeded to give my judgment on the fol­
lowing figure, rc£tified to the precife time the qfleftion was propoun­
ded.
Here the afcendant and the Moon are fignificators of the ihip ; and
Venus, becaufe the fign Taurus, the houfe of Venus, is on the afcendant,
is fignificatrix of the crew j and Mercury, with the Part of Fortune,
denote her <Wps and^all pt|iftr materials on-boardher. The Ihip itfelf
appears well found and fubftantial, but not, a fwift failer. as is demon-
ilrated by an earthy fign poflefling the cufp of the afcendant, and the
fituation.ofthe Dragon’s head infive degrees of the fame fign. The pla­
net Mars is fignificator of the enemy.
Now the Moon, which reprefents the ihip, being fituated in theeighth
houfe, the houfe of death and difappointment. and at the fame time be-
fieged by the two .malefic planets Saturn and Mars, denotes her to be
overpowered by the enemy. Mars, lord of the feventh, the houfe of
open
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 4oi

ies, being pofited with ail his dignities therein; an
d in re­
ception of Jupiter, lord of the enem
y’s houfe of fiibflancei an
d being
alfo difpofitor of the M
oon, M
ercury, an
d Venus, which reprefent the
fhip an
dcrew
, obvioufly declares themto be in the hands of theenem
y.
The fignificators, being pofited in fierv figns. indicate an engagem
ent to
havetaken place; but the fuperior llrength of the m
alefic rays of the
infortunes declareit to have b
eenof ihort duration, an
d of very unequal
force. The crew being reprefented by Venus, who is difpofed.of by
M
ars in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of im
prifonm
ent an
d afflRion,
plainly ihew
s themto be imprifoned in the enem
y’s country. And a
s
M
ercuryis retrograde, an
d fituated alfo in the twelfth houfe, w
ith the
Moon’s fortunate node, it is apparent that the iliip an
d flores will never
be reilored to theow
ners, but will be appropriatedto the u
fe of the cap­
tors, or difpofed of for their advantage. The M
oon’s pofition in the
eighth houfe declares the fhip to have been taken at a confiderable dif-
tance fromhom
e: an
dSagittarius polT
effin
gthecufpof theeighth, which
is afouth-wefl fjgn, an
d fituated in the fouth-weft part of the heavens,
denotes thecapture to hare been m
ade in a fouth-weil part of the world.
The querent left m
e with ilrong hopes of finding thisjudgm
ent erro­
neous; an
d appeared fo extrem
ely averfe to believe there could be any
truth init, (becaufe perhaps itoperatedfo m
uchagainfthis own intereil,)
that I w
ould not fuffer him to leave the roomuntil he h
ad prom
iled
upon his honour to let m
e know the refult. Accordingly, in about fix
m
onths afterw
ards, I received aIhort note fromhim
, inform
ing m
e that
the ow
nershad receivedadvice fromthecaptain of the privateer, that he
had fallen in with aFrenchfrigate of twenty-four guns, which being
vaftly fuperior to him

as obliged, after a ihort refiflance, to itrike
his colours, an

QUESTION III. Of an ABSENT SON, whetherDEAD orALIVE.

count of her fon, who h
adturnedout wild, an

out ever once fo far reflcdting on the difconfolate fituation of his parent,
as to be induced to ad

heard an im

ent abroad, in which her fon
3 ‘ w
as
a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
vc.-.s reported to be killed. Upon this unpleafant news, (he requeued
me to inform her, by the rules of Aftrology, whether her fon was dead
or alive ; or whether the account (he had heard was true or falfe. Her
uneafinels ofmind was too apparent for me to doubt her fincerity, or to
fuppofe the queftion not fit to be adjudged, and therefore I eroded this
figure, andgave my opinion thereon asfollows x
In this figure Virgo rifes upon the afeendant, and Mercury, lord
thereof, and fignificator of the querent, is pofited in the twelfth houfe,
the houfe ofamidion and forrow. The fifth houfe of the figure is here
considered as her fon’s firft or afeendant, and Saturn, lord thereof, is
his fignificator, and as pofited in the fourth angle, or itnutn cceli, which
repreients the grave and termination of all things. Saturn is alfo in
conjnndion with the part of fortune in the fourth, Wth of which are
-difpofed of by Jupiter, and Jupiter by Mars j which malefic planet
pouefles the Ton’s firft houfe or afeendant in his exaltation, and in
oppofition to the Sun and Venus in the fcventh, which is the houfe of
open enemies and war,
From
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 343
From thefe configurations I drew the inferences following; tha*
Mercury» the querent’s fignificator, by being ppfitedin the twelfth houfe*
plainly (hewed her fears were too well grounded. That Saturn, figni­
ficator of the quefited, and the part of fortune, being both difpofed of by
Jupiter, and this planet difpofea of by Mars, indicates all their benevo­
lent effects to be deftroyed by the malignant influence of this infortune.
Mars being in the ion’s afcendant, in his exaltation, and in oppofition to
Sol, is a ftrong argument of a violent death ; the kind and manner of
which is thus defcribed. Saturn, his fignificator, is poiited in the fiery
fign Sagittarius ; and Leo, which occupies the cufp of his eighth, and
Aries the cufp of his fourth, are alfo of the fiery triplicity; the Sun,
the giver of life and light of time, is pofited in the watery fign Cancer,
difpofed of by the Moon, in the watery fign Pifces, and the Moon by
Jupiter in the watery fign Scorpio ; and the whole of their influences are
transferred to the fiery planet Mars, in his afcendant. From thefe cir-
cumftances it became obvious to me that the youth was no longer in ex-
iftence, that his death happened upon the water, by means of fome fatal
warlike inftrument, and in fome defperate engagement with an open
enemy. •
■ The querent then afked me if I could give herany fatisfa&ory account
how long ago this happened. 1 took down the degrees and minutes of
the two principal fignificators, viz. the Sun end Mars, and fubtra&ed
the one from the other, which gave four degrees five minutes for the re­
mainder ; and this being converted into time by the rules before laid
down for moveable figns, in which the above fignificators were pofited, I
informed her the accident had befallen her fon foroewhat more than a
month before fhe heard the news of it. Some time afterwards a fhip ar­
rived with an account of this engagement, which happened on the coaft
of France, andconfirmed the whole of this judgment, by proving every
fadt I had mentioned to have literally come to pals.
QJJESTIONIV. On the Profpea of RICHES.
A gentleman called upon me to enquire, whether any remarkable
change of circumftanccfi would everhappen to him jo refpeft of riches,
and the time when. Conceiving his defire to arifc fromaftrong impulle
of the mind, 1 took the exafi tune of the day, and eroded the follow­
ing figwe to refelve this queftion.
No. 17. The
344 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
The lord of the afcendant, and lord of the hour, being of one nature
and triplicity, ihews the figure to be radical. And, as Gemini occupies
the culp of the afcendant, Mercury is its lord, and the querent's fignifi-
cator; and being pofited in the eleventh houfe, in awatery fign, and in
trine to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, who is here pofited in the iixth, is
ailrong argument of riches by means of fervants, or of perfons in a fub-
ordinate capacity. The Moon, who is lady of the fecond, being in her
exaltation, in trine afpedt to the Sun, and applying to a trine with Jupi­
ter, and a dexter trine afpe£l with Mercury, declares a great and fuddea
how of riches to the querent, and that unexpectedly.
Being much profiled to fpeak to the particular point of time when this
good fortune ihould come up, I considered what might be the gentle^
man’s occupationj and obferving Mercury to he his fignificator, and po-
fited in a watery fign, I told him that I judged he belonged to the fea,
and had fome employment on ihip-board, in a capacity where writing or
accounts were principally concerned. This he acknowledged, by faying
he was captain's fecrctary. I then obfcrved that his principal fignifica*
2 tors
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 345
tors of wealth and riches were alfo pofited in watery figns, as the Moon
in Cancer in the fccond houfe, and Jupiter in Scorpio in the fixth, and
the Sun and Mercury in Pifces in the eighth, «11 in trine afpeft of each
other, which plainly indicated thefe riches were to come by the fea; and
as they were to be fudden, and as it were inftantaneous, I concluded they
would arife by the capture of fome rich prize,, in a fouth-eail direction
from London, which is denoted by the part of fortune being in the
twelfth houfe, and Venus, its difpoiitor, in Aquaries, a fouthern fign,
in quartile afpett to thePart of Fortune; and the Part of Fortune being
oppoiite to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, the houfe of public enemies,
alfo declares the querent’s fortune (hould come that way; which is ren­
dered toll more apparent, by the Part of Fortune being in fextile to the
Moon and Mercury. When I had mentioned thefe particulars, he
frankly told me, his (hip was under failing orders, and he expcdtcd to be
called on board every hour.
*
Toafcertain the time when thefe riches (hould be acquired, I parti­
cularly noticed the application of the Moon to the lord of the afcendant,
and found them nineteen degrees diftant from a partile trine afpeft. But
the Moon, being fwift in motion, with three degrees north latitude, and
Mercury having no latitude, I deducted three degrees from the Moon’s
place, which I fet down at twelve degrees; and then, by fubtratling twelve
degrees from'twenty-eight degrees three minutes, which is Mercury’s
place, there remains fixtcen degrees three minutes ; which, as the Moon
is in a moveable iign, and Mercury in a common fign, is equal to fix­
teen weeks, or thereabout; and therefore I.concluded this good fortune
would happen to him in nearly that diftance of time. And I have fine*
had the fatisfa&ion of hearing, from the gentleman’s own mouth, that
this prediftion was literally verified,, by the captureof arich prize, with­
in the time fpecified.

QyESTION V. On the Succefs of a JOURNEY.
Being applied to by a tradefman, who was going a journey on fomi

Here I find four degrees foarteeo minutes of Gemini upon the cufp of
the horolcopc, and confequfently Mercury is the querent’s fignificator,
which being pofited in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of anxiety and dif»
appointment, combnft ofthe Sun, and difpofcd of by Mars, the iinpli-
cator of private enemies, in the querent’s houfe of fublbnce j thefe
pofitions plainly ihewed the objedt of the journey to be concerning the
adjustment of fome accounts, or othermoneymatters. The Moon, lady
of the third, fignifies the journey j and the feventh houfe and its lord,
i. e. Jupiter, reprefents theplace andperfon the querent is going to.
Now the Moon having lately feparated from a partile conjunction of
her fortunate node andJupiter, andapplying to aquartile of Mars, and
then to a conjunction of Venus, tend to prove that his journey fhould
befafe andunimpeded ; but at the fame time denotes that the obje& ofit
fhouldnot be accomplifhed, which is further confirmed by the pofitioa
of Mars in the fecondhoufe. 1 informedhim that he would moft pro­
bably meet with unpleafanttreatment from fome lady, refpeding money
concerns, and that they fhould part in anger, which would terminate to

his prejudice; an
dthis I conceived fromthe application of the M
oon to
aquartileafpedf with M
ars» followed by aconjundlion with Venus. It
further appeared to m
e that hisjourney w
ould be far from pleafant o
r
agreeable ; but that onthecontrary he w
ould m
eet with great vexation,
trouble, and difappointm
ent. This is indicated by the M
oon's unfor­
tunate node, or Dragon's tail, being pofited in the fifth, or houfe of
pleafure an
d delight, at the fam
e tim
e that th
.e querent's fignificator oc­
cupies the houfe of difappointm
ent an
d trouble. H
ence I periuaded
him to poftpone his journey to afuture day, becaufe, if he did go, I w
as
perfcdtly‘fatisfied he would lofe m
ore than he w
ould gain, exclafive of
being difappointed in the principal objedt of it. He then left m
e, and
went hom

inedmind; but h
as fince told m
e that his
neceffity got the better of his reafon
, an
d therefore he went the journey
contrary to m

exaftly asI had predidted them

taking than in the form

pedts all inthequerent’sfavour, I told him he had no tim

on the point of leaving a fixed fign, andentering upon a comixton fign,
clearly implies a ftrong inclination in thequerent to travel, or to remove

But. for a more general mpde of afcertaining whether a lady be preg­
nant with a boy or girl, take particular notice of the afcendant and its
lord, and o f thé fifth houfe and its lord,; and note whether the iigns
upon their cufps be either Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, or
Aquaries, for thefe figns always import a male; but, the other fix give
a female. If the lord of the afcendant be in a mafculine fign, and the
lord of the fifth in a feminine, then have recourfe to the Moon, and, if
ihe applies to a planet in a malculine fign, ihe gives a boy; but, if a fe­
minine, a girl. Always remember that the mafculine planets are Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun; and the feminine, Venus and the Moon.
Mercury, as he happens to be pofited either with a mafculine or feminine
planet, inclines accordingly ; but, when he is oriental of the Sun, he is
reputed mafculine; and, when occidental, feminine.
The querent will fometimes aik how long ihe hath conceived. T o
refolve this, have regard to the Moon, the lord of the fifth, and the lord
o f the hour, and note which is neareil from the feparation of any planet,
and from what afpedt this feparation was ; if from a trine afpedt, ihe is
in the third or filth month of her conception ; if from a fextile, ihe is
either two or fix months gone ; if the feparation was from a qoartile,
tie is in her fourth month ; if from an oppofition, ihe hath conceived
feven months ; but, if from a conjundtion, ner conception has been only
one month.

QUESTION X. On COURTSHIP and MARRIAGE.
A yomtg lady having for fome time received the addreiies o f a gentle­
man o f ¡fortune, during w hich» variety o f drcumftances had occurred
to put off the much-wiihed-for day o f confummating their nuptials; and
being alfo in doubt whether her lover had not iomc'attachment to an­
other lady, who (hared in his affections, and fought for.hi* company,
(he was induced to come to me-for my advice and opinion, whether the
above gentleman was really fincere in bis profeffions to her, and whether
their marriage ftiould ever be contaminated, and when ? Finding her
perfectly fincere and earned in her withes, and the queftion. truly radi­
cal, I gave her my j udgmcpt as follow«: . .

Ifrvfcd that in this, and in a&queftifios relative to matrimony, M ari and
the Sun ale the natural fignificators o f a woman’s marriage j and Venue
tftd the Moon ate thole o f e maafi. N ow Saturn^ the gentleman'« figni­

‘ *indication thathit affeduxis are finccre end honourable, and that
his mind isfallybent to the msmage-fhte. The Sun ifkewiie, being
in a feztiie afpea with Mars, the lady's figniftoator of marriage, plainly
ihews her inclination tp matrimony to be ftrongly fixed, and her affec­
tions perf«6Uy finccre, ,
The. next thing to be confidered, is, whether there be any frustration,
or impe'diting afpeft between thefe fignificators ; and, I find the Moon
and Venus, the gentleman’s fignificators. of marriage, are applying to a
quartileafped with each other. This is an evident proof that the
marriage is.prolonged by the interference o f fome Other woman of this
gentleman's intubate acquaintance, bepaufe the afpe£t is made in a femi­
nine fign j hut as the Moon, in Ieparating from Venus, applies po a per­
fect trine with Mars, the querent's principal fignificator of marriage,
and alfo to a Textile of the S ub, her natural fignificator in the figure, it
total lyjem oves the evil effedts of the maleic aipeft, and leaves the path
free and‘ uipobftriwfted to the gates of Hymen. ^This opinion.,^ greatly
ftrengihiened by co n fid in g the mode in which tfyeir fignificators are
feverally difpofed. Satnrftdifoofej* of (he Sun,‘ who.is pofited in the
term qf Venus ; and Venus, Saturn, and the Mpon, are all difpofed o f
by the benevolent planet Jupiter, who is hityfelf difpofed of by Mars»
the principal fignificator of this lady’s marriage, and who thus triumphs
over every obftacle to the celebration of their nuptials. I therefore could
not hefitate in declaring to the lady, in the fulleft and moft fatisfa&ory
terms, that the gentleman who courted her had a fincereand tender regard
for her; and that, though fome circumftances might have happened ra­
ther unfavourable to her withes, yet the might reft perfectly allured that
he was the man allotted to be her huiband.
Apparently well fatisfied with thefe declarations, ihe proceeded to en­
quire in what length of time this defirable circumftance might come to
pafs. T o gratify her wilhes in this particular, I referred again to the
figure Where the Moon, the gentleman's principal fignificator of mar­
riage, wants upwards of eleven degrees of forming a perfeft Textile afpeci

Q U E S T I O N XI. On W A R and B A T T L E .
During.the trial of a certain noble Commander in Chief, atfoe Go­
vernor’s tfoiife in Pprtfmouth, a company of gentlemen one day called
upon me, and requefted Fwould take down the pofitions of the planets
at the time that much-talked-of action commenced, tod give them my
judgment upon it, according to the rules of planetary influence. Wil­
ling to oblige them in a matter which I conceived could be of nb pre­
judice to any party, fince no advantage could be taken from it; and alfo
deeming it a fit fubjed whereby to manifeft the fublimity and excellence
of this art, I hefitated not to promife them every information in my
power. For this purpofe I ereded my figure, not to the time this
queftien eras propounded, 'for, it related to an event that had long been
pafledby, ana not to any matted that was hereafter expeded to happen¡
and therefore 1 proje&ed foe fcheme to correfpond with the exaft time
when this extraordinary a£H
on commenced, and at which moment the
heavenly bodies were under the remarkable configurations delineated in
the following fcheme:
The
359
O F A S T lC*0 L O G Y .
The afcendant, the Moon, and Venus, reprefent the Britilh fleet}
M ars and Aries denote that of the enemy. The firft thing to be con-
iidered is the afpedt thefe two fignificators bear to one another, which is
a partile Textile, a well-known indication of imperfect love ; and, as it
(hews that Mars and Venus have not in themfelves an inveterate hatred,
l'o it imports that the two commanders in chief did not behold each other
in an afpedt of pcrfedt and direful malignancy and wrath. Venus, lady
of the alcendant, is pofited with Jupiter in his fall, a benevolent planet
and a lover of peace; and, as he is in this figure lord of the third houfe,
and within fifty degrees of the afcendant, it indicates that both com­
manders have a defire to promote peace, by adting principally upon the
defeniive, and by guarding and protecting their refpedive coalls, without
a delire of any dole or decifive action, or of venturing to any great dis­
tance from home.
The cool, cautious, deliberate, planet Saturn, is fituated in the firft
houfe, and indicates not lo much a defire lor hot and precipitate action,
' 18. 4 R as
360 a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
as for felf-prefervation, ox the prote&ion of national wealth] <md this is
plainly exemplified in the Rritifh Admiral’s watchfulnefs and care in
covering and protefting the homeward*bound India fleet, as well as in
the French Admiral’s retiring after he found his views upon that rich
and Unguarded flota were completely fruftrated. The pofition o f Mer­
cury, being combuft of the Son, and diipofer o f the Moon, Venus, and
Jupiter, apd lord alfo of the twelfth houfe, the houfe o f private enm ity'
and malice, indicates private rancour and enmity in a fubordinate com­
mander) and, as Mercury is pofited between the two fignificators, Venus
and Mars^ evilly dignified, and combuft, fo he denotes the perfon repre­
fented by him will infallibly be governed by malevolent principles, and
ufe his influen.ee to retard the objeft of the bufinefs in hand. The truth
of^this indication has, I think, been too well cftablifhed to need any
further iliuftration from me.
The enemy, as I have before obferved, is reprefented by Mars, who
is pofited in the tenth houfe, the houfe of honour, and in the fign o f
his triplicity, but in the dignities of Jupiter; and this fhews that the
enemy would as much as poflible avoid clofe aftion, but would take the
advantage to ihift from fighting ; and Mars, being in his fall, deprives
the enemy of their honour, and clearly proves, that, if a clofe and well-
connetted-a&ion had been kept up, and continued without ceafing, a
decifive vi6lory would have followed on the part o f the £ngliih, becaufe
Jupiter is in conjun&ion with Venus and the Moon, which difpofes of
M ars; but, as Mars has the watery triplicity aftigned him, he ftiews the
enemy ihould take the advantage of that element to run away.
W e find alfo, in the above figure, a quartile afpeft oFSaturn and Mer­
cury, a configuration which is always known to produce tempeftuous
weather and ftrong winds; and this we find was the cafe off Uihant
at the time of the above engagement. The pofition of Mercury in the
firft, where Saturn is fituated, plainly indicates thefe winds to be highly
conducive to the fafety o f the enemy, but of dangerous tendency to the
Britiih fleet, in cafe of a purfuit.
After duly weighing the natural influences and efle&s o f the configu­
rations in this figure, which are the true and genuine ftate of the hea­
vens at the time of the engagement, I hefitated not to declare, that both
commanders had a ftronger inclination to preferve peace than to break it,
and that a clofe conne&ed and decifive action was not to happen, owing
to Saturn being in the afeendant on the fide of the Engliih, with too
much thought and deliberation; and to Mars being in his fall in the
a dignities
O P A S T R O L O G Y . 361
dignities o f Jupiter, on the part of the French,, which declares their
watchfulnefs to run away. This judgment is likcwife further confirmed
by the two principal iignificators not forming a warlike afpeft, but
operating by one rather inclined to tranquillity and peace.
Whoever contemplates the preceding figure, and defines its afpefts by
the rules laid down in this or in any other Treatife 'on Aftrology, will
find no point {trained to eflfe& the tendency o f the foregoing judgment.
T he meaning put upon them here is uniform an<^ natural, and no more
than what they are and have been allowed to bear from the earlieft ages,
and fuch as every profcflor o f the art mud allow to be confonant' to the
drifted rules of the fcience. If this be admitted, I think it mud drike'
the fenfe of every intelligent man, that this polition of the planets, on
the famous 27th of July, could not have been configurated to defcribe
the particular turns of that aftion, by mere accident, nor without hav­
ing fomc influence upon it.— A firong proof of planetary operation, as
well as of the moral certainty o f predicting by their means. -
Q U E S T I O N X II. On T H E F T .
'Being once on a journey through the W ed of England, and particular
bufinefs detaining me in a fmall town where fome of my friends lived,
an atrocious robbery and burglary was, during that time, committed in
the neighbourhood, in the houfe of a poor old blind decrepid man, who,
by hard labour and rigid economy in hi6 younger days, had faved up
three hundred pounds to divide among his children at his-death. This
money was kept in a firong chcil by the bedfide where the poor old man
lay; when fome villains, watching an opportunity in the abfence of his
family, made their way into his apartment, broke open the cheft, and'
carried off all the money undifcovered. M y friends hereupon made it
known that I had fome knowledge of the occult fciences, and, if applied-
to, might poffibly give fome account how the money w ent; in confe-

to do my utmoft to ferve this diftrefled family, and for this purpoie
projected the following figure.
The
3
6z a n i l l u s t r a t i o n
The fign Taurus, occupying the afcendant, gives Venus for the querent’s
fignificatrix; the Moon, lady of the fourth, reprefents the querent’s
father, and the feventh and tenth houfes are to denote the thieves; and,
the reafon I allot two houfes for them is, becatffe the feventh houfe of
the figure is the natural lignificator of thieves to the querent, who was
heir to part of the money, and had been promifed it by his father, and
conkquently bore a (hare in the lofs j and* the tenth houfe being the
father’s feventh, reckoned from his firft, or fourth in the figure, natu­
rally denotes thieves to h im ; and therefore, as ihe fon is querent, and
the father had the principal ihare in the lofs, both tbefe houfes mull be
well cotifidered, before any account can be given of the thieves.
• <
*
Here I find Jupiter, lord of the eighth and twelfth houfe, pofited in
the tenth, out of all hiseflential dignities, in his fall,'and confignifica-
tor with Mars; wherefore, 1 declared two pcrfonsJo be concerned in the
rubbery, «ad described them according to thele fignificators, viz. amid*
die lLture, with dark brown hair, pale complexion, of a furly diipo-
fition,
O F A S T B O L O G, Y . 363
fitted, one <bt|*ewhat fiwtor than tht -.-r; and appeared to be (ons of
a perfon who had worked with or for the querent’s rather.
M y next bufinefs was to confider what was done with the money; and,
as there are two fignificators in refped o f the queition, namely, the fe-
venth houfes and their lords, fo there muft be two to reprefent the dif-
pofal o f W
the money; and thefe are the fourth houfes and their lords.
Accordingly I find the M oon, who governs the querent’s fourth houfe,
pofited in Scorpio, a watery fign j and, being alfo underneath the fign, I
declared fome part of the money was buried underneath a rock or (lone
over which the tide Bowed, and near the habitation of the thieves,
which I judged was not far difiant from the fea-fide. Again, I find Mars
lord of the father’s fourth, pofited in Capricorn, a beaftial fign, in con­
junction with Jupiter, who governs corn, and with Saturn, who rules
the fruits o f the earth; and, as Mars is the lighter planet, and applies to
Jupiter, and as Jupiter is in the term o f Saturn, I concluded that an­
other part o f the money had been paid away to fome hufbandman or far­
mer, who refided about the diftance of eight miles fouth from the place
where the robbers lived.
W hen thefe circumftances were all thrown together, and each duly
confidered, fufpicion fell upon two perfons, who were brothers, in every
refpeft anfwering to this defeription, and who, upon enquiry, they found
had paid one hundred pounds to a farmer three days after the robbery
was committed, who lived in the fituation above deferibed, and who
had for fome time threatened, the parties with an aCtion, on account of
their backwardnefs or inability to pay him. Upon this I was aiked if
the parties were taken up, whether any of the money would be recovered ?
T o anfwer this, I referred again to the figure, and noted the fituation
of the two luminaries, both of which are afflicted. The light of time
is pofited in the twelfth houfe, in conjunction with Venus, lady of the
afeendant, and fignificatrix of the querent, which affords one ftrong ar­
gument againft recovering the money. The Moon is alfo greatly afflift-
ed in the fixth houfe, and in no afpeCt either to the Sun or to the
afeendant, but on the contrary is applying to a trine of Mercury, lord
of the fixth, and this to a fextile of Saturn, lord of the father’s fixth,
and alfo the fignificators of the two thieves j all which pofitions give the
ftrongeft proofs o f an utter impofiibility of recovering any part of the
property, particularly as both the fignificators of the querent and his
rather are greatly afniCted by accidental pofitions, as well as by the
part' o f fortune being in conjunction with the Moon’s unfortunate
N o. 18. 4 S node,
364 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
node, or Dragon’s tail; wherefore I judged the money loft beyond
recovery.
Many circumftances, however, afterwards concurring, to confirm this
fufpicion of the two brothers above alluded to, they were in confequence
taken into cuftody, and examined before feveral of the county magif-
trates, who found fufficient grounds to commit them for trial at the
next afiizes. They were in confequence arraigned; but, though fuf­
picion fell heavy upon them, yet, as no pofitive evidence could be
adduced to prove they were caught in the faft, or to identify the money,
they were both acquitted, notwithftanding the long train^jf well-con-
nc&ed and concurring circumftances, which came out upon the trial,
left them guilty in the eyes of all the court.
Q U E S T I O N X III. On L E G A C I E S .
A perfon o f a free and convivial humour called upon me to enquire
concerning a legacy which his wife’s mother had often promifed to
leave them at her death; but, having had fome high words, in confe­
quence of his loofe way of living, ihe had lately refeinded her former
promifes; and, as this lay upon his mind, and had vexed him for fome
days paft, he was now defirous to know, by the eeleftial intelligencers,
whether this legacy would be left him or not. Finding the man fin-
cere in his wifties, and, deeming the qneftion perfe&ly radical, I pro*
seeded to give my judgment upon the matter as follows.
Mercury
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 36S
Mercury is here lordof the afcendant, andfignificator of the querent $
he is fituated in the feventh houfe, and difpofes of Jupiter, the fignifi­
cator of his wife, who is pofited in the fourth, his own houfc, ftrong
and powerful, and in trine afpeci to the Sun. The Moon's fortunate
node likewife falls in the wife'^fecond houfe, in fextile afpedt to the part
of fortune in the querent's fecond; all which are very powerful tefti-
monies that the querent's wife would .not lofe her inheritance. This
opinion is alfo flrengthened by the pofition of the benevolent planet
Jupiter, who is lord of Pifces, and the wife's fignificator, and lord alfo
of the wife’s t“nth, and fignificator of the mother, viz. thefourth houfe
in the figure; which evidently ihews a mutual love and attachment be­
tween the mother and daughter, that nothing but death can efface, and
to which inheritance will follow.
The querent’s fignificator being in his fall in Pifces, a watery fign,
and in conjunction with Venus, ihews him to be a m
an given up to
drinking and conviviality* and perhaps to other fpecies of intemperance,
¿66 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
as is denoted by the quartile o f Jupiter and M ercury; and further (hews
that it has in fome meafore been the means o f alienating the wife's affec­
tions from him. And, as Mercury is difpofed of by Jupiter, in a femi­
nine fign, and pofited with a feminine planet, and. being alfo controver­
tible in his nature to the quality of any planet he is in configuration
with, plainly manifefts the querent to be of an effeminate mind and fpi-
rit, content to give up all rule and government to his wife, fo he nas
but the enjoyment of his friend and his bottle. .
The fituation of the Sun and the Dragon’s head in the wife's fecond,
or querent’s eighth, denotes that he bad heretofore receded a legacy by
the death of his wife’s father j which being mentioned, he readily con-
feffed that it was fo. This legacy he appears to have fquandered away,
as is manifefted by the part o f fortune being in conjunción with the
Dragon’s tail in the fecond houfe. And now, taking all the foregoing
afpeits together, and noting that the Sun, the natural fignificators o f
fathers, is pofited in his exaltation, with the Moon’s fortunate node,
and free from all fruftration or affliction ¡ and notwithstanding the que­
rent had fquandered away the firft legacy by the father, and had lately
fallen out with the motherj yet I hefitated not to declare, that, accord­
ing to the belt of my judgment, he would be certain of the legacy by
the mother alfo ¡ not out o f any regard or love to him, but purely
through her affection and anxioufnefs for the welfare and happinefs o f
her daughter.
Q U E S T I O N XIV. On the Succefs of a F L E E T.
A t the time Admiral Rodney fet fail for the W eft Indies, with a
grand fquadron under his command, and a convoy of above three hundred
fail of merchant (hips, exhibiting at once the pride, the glory, and the
riches, of this great commercial empire, I was applied to by fome naval
gentlemen, who particularly requefted me to give them my opinion on
the fuccefs of the Admiral’s expedition, and the fafety of his fleet.
Many opinions had for fome time been in circulation relative to this
equipment, and many of the firft-rate connoifleurs in politics had un­
dertaken to declare it too Weak for the objeft of its destination, and that
it would fall an eafy prey to the enemy; I was therefore the more rea­
dily prevailed upon to projeft a figure for this queftion, upon which I
delivered my judgment as follows.
i The
c*

trefs, in regard to his private circumftances. But this afflidtion appears
only as a dark cloud, which, when the Storm is over, quickly gives way
to the all-cheering and enlivening beams of the refreshing Sun, And
this is evinffed by the Admiral’s fignificator having juft Separated from
this malignant configuration, and afterwards forming a propitious Textile
afpeft in the zodiac, and a mundane trine afpeit to the Second houfc, the
houfe of profpcrity, fortune, and riches, aided by Mars, the lord there­
of, who is Situated in the firft houfe, and in his own triplicity.
In examining thefe Significators, I find Saturn, who reprefents the
Admiral, is difpofed of by Jupiter, lord of the tenth houfe, the houfe of
princes, which Shews his appointment came from the king himfelf.
Venus, lady of the enemy’shoufe of fnbftance, as well as all the fignifi-
cators of the enemy, and part of fortune alfo, are difpofed of by Saturn,
lord of the afeendant; and Mars, the natural fignificator of war, and
lord of the British Admiral’s houfe of fubftance and riches, is pollted
in the afeendant, in trine to Scorpio, his own Sign, in the ninth, the
houfe of fea-voyages; and, being alfo in his own triplicity, Shews that
this voyage Shall be profperousand important. This judgment is greatly
Strengthened by the pofnion of the propitious fixed Star Fomahaut,
in the firft houfe; which, being of the nature of Venus and Mercury,
and of the firft magnitude, and joined with Mars in Pifces, declares
great riches, honour, and preferment, Should be acquired by this voy­
age, and fuch as Should place the noble commander above the frowns
and malice of both his public and private enemies.
The Sign on the feventh houfe, and the intercepted fign Virgo, Shew
the destination of the fleet; and the Sun and Mercury reprefent the
enemies they Shall meet with; and, as the lord of the feventh is pofited
in a fgn that has more planets within its degrees than one, fo it points
out that the Admiral Shall be engaged with more fleets than one. Here
is alfo a moil remarkable reception between Venus and Mars in exalta­
tion ; Mars being pofited in the fign of the exaltation of Venus, and
Venus in the fignof theexaltation of Mars; and, as Venus is lady of the
enemy’s houfe of fubftance, this reception declares that the British Sleet
will capture many rich and noble prizes, and make great havock with
the fubftance or riches of the enemy. Mars being in Textile afpefit with
the part of fortune, and the Sun lord of the feventh, Shews thefe prizes
'L Mbe taken with much fighting. And that the vidtory Shall declare
f on the Side of the English, is manifested by Venus, fignificatrix
of the enemy’s fubftance, being difpofed of by Saturn, the lord of the
afeendant, and fignificator of the British Admiral.
After
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 369
After duly weighing the probable tendency of all thefe propitious
afpe&s, and refle&ing that the Moon, whofe influence is considerable,
is polited in the dignities of Saturn; andthat Jupiter and Saturn difpofe
of all the planets in the figure; and likewife that Jupiter and Saturn
are the grand fignificators of the Britiih Admiral and fleet, I boldly af­
firm
ed this expedition would prove fortunate and fuccefsful, crowning
its com
m
anders, and all under them, with honour, glory, and riches,
and adding immortal fam
e to the annals of the Britiih page. This is a
fad that has accordingly happened, andfitchas comes within the cogni­
zance of every individual. ’ .

ade
himalmoil defpair of fuccefs, cam
e to aik my opinion whether,’ if he
perfevered in his folicitations, he ihould eventually obtain the prefer­
ment he fo much dcfired. I gave my judgment of this qucftion from
the following figure.
Jlerc
370 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
Here the celeftial Crab afcends upon the horQicope, and :’the Moon*
fignificatrix of the querent* is pofited in the fign Leo. The tenth houfe
bears fignification of the qugrent's honour and promotion; and the ele­
venth denotes his friends and patrons. The Moon, lady of the afeend-
ant* being pofited in the fecond houfe* out of all her elTential dignities*
declares the querent to be in diflrefied circumilanccs, and that his failure
hitherto has been greatly owing to the want of money. His patrons in
the prefent bufinefs are deferibed by Venus, who being pofited in the
fign Pifces, in every degree of her exaltation, fhews them to be of fuf-
ficient weight and intereft to accomplish his defires; and as Venus is
alfo in a propitious fextile afpett with Mars, and in trine to the afeen-
dant, it indicates that his petition ihall be attended to, and his wiihes
gratified.
This judgment is abundantly confirmed by the following confidera-
tions. The Sun is pofited in the medium cceli, the houfe of his ex­
altation; and the fortunate node of the Moon is conjoined with him
in the tenth alfo, which is an irrefragible argument of honour and pre­
ferment. It is alfo to be obferved that the Sun is lord of the fecond
houfe, and difpofes of the Moon, the querent’s fignificatrix j and thus
thews that his preferment thoald be in the military line. And as a
watery fign rifes upon his afeendant, and occupies the cufp of his ninth
houfe, and as Mercury, lord of his third houfe, is pofited in his ninth,
it declares he ihall be fubjedt to an employment upon water; and, being
in Scorpio, a fixed fign, denotes the querent (hall be fubje.i. to a long
continuance upon the water, and at a great diilance from home. Venus
being lilcewife in the fame fign, inihe triplicity of Mars, and Mars in
the triplicity of Venus, and in fextile afpect of each other, denotes he
(hall hereafter meet with a number of friends, and prove remarkably
fortunate in his poft. This poft is reprefented by the fituation of the
Moon in Leo, and Mars in Taurus, and the Sun in Aries, to be a com­
mand on board (hip, over foldiers or marines; and this he acknow­
ledged was what he had been foliciting for, and what I told him he
would certainly fuccecd in.
He then requefted me to afeertain the length of time in which I fup-
pofed this command would be given him. I took notice of the degree
the Moon was in, and what applications (he had made.' I obferved (he
had lately been in trine afpedt of the Sun, which ftrongly prompted the
querent to puih forward for promotion; andher next application, being
to a trine with her fortunate node, declares this promotion ihall be
very ihortly attained, though with difficulty, bccaufe (he is at the fame

tend to lave his lifa^and faeflitafr his enlargement. <

thefe, it iaeafy to determine what kind o f perfon the new-born babe

Saturn in Leo gives a perfon of a moderate large rtature, broad round
fliouiders, wide chert, light brown hair, of afurly- auftere afpcQ, ra­
ther lean, and hollow-eyed, large bones and muicles, and bends or
ftoops forward in going. Thcqualitics of the mind and difporttion are

fities to little purpofe; ftudious, fubtle, and referved; and, unlefs fome
other configurations of the planets contradict, is too much addi&ed to
pilfering and indirect dealing.
Saturn in Libra deferibes a perfon',above the middle rtature, tolerably
handfome, brown hair, an oval face', a large nofe and forehead, a mode­
rately clear‘complexion, yet not beautiful; not willing to entertain low
or mean thoughts o f tbemfelves, fomewhat prodigal in expences, and
confequently rarely leave any confiderable eftate behind them for their

vifage, and an ill pofture in going ; for the qualities of the mind, Sa­
turn fo pofited, and iigniiicator, ufually gives a difcontented, melan­

to ufe many words, a lover of the earth, and all things of profit pro­
duced from thence, fearful, fubject to retain anger, and rarely wants a

body rather inclinable to corpulency than otherwife, dark brown hair,

courteous, of an excellent fearching fancy, and generally a very happy
proficient in what he labours after, whether in fciences or curious arts;
apt to conceit and think well of his own powers and abilities, and
therefore fubjcdt to no ill-becoming pride j but naturally a perfon of a
very pregnant genius.
Saturn in Pifces reprefents aperfon of a middle ftature, pale complex­

times the teeth diftorted, not very comely, yet active, and too much in­
clined to diilimulation, contentious, malicious, and prone to many ill
a&ions, which abate as the perfon grows in years $ not loquacious,
but very deliberate; in fine, it denotes an uncertain fickle perfon in moft

rather lean than corpulent; but generally a perfon of a noble and free
difpofition, one that loves a good outfide, and to demean himfelf with
much generofity amongft his friends and afiociates, and confequently
very obliging and complacent.
Jupiter in Tauriis gives a perfon of a middle ftature, wellfet, a fwar-

the judgment found, and a perfon of no contemptible deportment; a
lover of the female fex, and generally good-natured, and free to fuch
objeds as deferve charity and companion.
Jupiter in Gemini reprefents a decent well-compofed body, with fan-
guine complexion, not very clear, a perfon above a middle ftature, rather
tall than otherwife, brown hair, full becoming eyes, a graceful deport­
ment, very affable and courteous, a gentle, mild, obliging, perfon, an
admirer of the female fex, efpecially thofe of the mod: refined wit and
beauty, a general lover, of learning; but, if Jupiter be near violent fixed
ftars, it renders the perfon raih and unftable in his a&ions, and confe-
quently inimical to himfelf, and unacceptable to others.
Jupiter in Cancer gives a perfon of a middle ftature, a pale, unwhole-
fome, fickly, complexion, fleihy, or inclinable to corpulency, dark
brown hair, an oval face, and the body moftly difproportioned; a bufy
loquacious perfon, too apt to intermeddle with other men’s affairs, con­
ceited and high, has no mean thoughts of his own abilities, a great lover
of women; fortunate by water, and delights to be thereon, and yet a
perfon of very little courage or valour, unlefs his fignificator be well
beheld of Mars.
Jupiter in Leo reprefents a ftrong well-proportioned body, tall of fta­
ture, light brown or yellowiih curling hair, ruddy complexion, full
eye, and a perfon fufticiently comely; in difpofition very noble minded,
courageous, magnanimous, lofty ; delighting in valiant warlike aitions
and atchicvements he proves a terror to his enemies, and a perfon that
fcorns to bend to an adverfary, but will encounter with any danger or
hazard for the fake of honour.
Jupiter in Virgo gives a perfon of a reafonable full ftature, brown
hair tending to blacknefs, ruddy complexion, but not fair or clear, a
well-built perfon, and one we term handfome, having a due proportion
and conformity in all the members; in difpofition fomewhat choleric,
and ambitious of honour, inclinable to boafting, ftudious, yet covet­
ous, and through raihnefs fubjeft to Ioffes in eftate ; in fine, not eafily
wrought upon by any perfon.
»
Jupiter in Libra perfonates a compleat body and inviting countenance,
a moft clear complexion, a full eye, an upright ftature, rather tall than
otherwife, not grofs but ilendcr, an oval face, light brown hair, fome-
times

times flaxen» fubjedt to pimples in the face $ of a very mild difpofltion
and winning behaviour» a great delighter in noble exercifes and recrca-
tions, obliging to all perfons¡ and confequently gains much honour
and eiteem.
Jupiter in Scorpio reprefents a perfon of a middle ilature, a well com»
patted body, brown hair, a full fleihy face, a dull complexion; but,
in difpofltion, a lofty, proud, ambitious, perfon ¡ one that delires anden­
deavours to bear rule over his equals, refolute, and ill-natured, cove­
tous, and guilty of too much fubtlcty in all his actions j and therefore
ought warily to be dealt with by thofe who ¿hall be' concerned with
fuch a perfon.
r
Jupiter in Sagittarius gives an upright tall ilature of body, chefnut-
coloured hair, oval face, ruddy complexion, much beard, a good eye,
a perfon every way decently compofed; in difpofltion very courteous
and affable, of a moil noble graceful deportment and behaviour, juft, in
all his adtions, and injurious to none, generally a great lover of horfes ;
and, in fíne, a moil accompliihed perfon, deferving commendation and
more than ordinary refpect from all perfons with whom he converfes and
alfociates.
Jupiter in Capricorn gives a mean ilature of body, a pale complexion,
thin face, little head, not much beard, a fmall weakly perfon generally,
yet ingenious; brown hair, fometimes the beard lighter of colour than
the hair of the head; in qualities and conditions not very commendable,
low-fpirited, peeviih, not very aftive nor fortunate in the world, unlefs
fome other teftimonies aiflil; in fíne, a very helplefs, indigent, harm-
lefs, perfon.
Jupiter in Aquaries perfonates a middle ilature, brown hair, indif­
ferently well fet, a clear complexion, rather a corpulent body than
otherwife, and well compadted; in difpofltion chearful and affable, hurt­
ful to none, but obliging to all, delights in decent and moderate recrea­
tion, very juft and merciful, evento thofe that are enemies; in (hort,
a very good-humoured, laborious, induftrious, perfon, rarely guilty of
any extravagance, but generally of a very commendable difpofltion and
deportment. .
Jupiter in Pifces deferibes a perfon of a middling ilature, of a dark
complexion, fleihy body, and light brown hair, a harmlefs creature, yet

Jupiter.ufually fignifies good teeth, as Saturn doth the contrary, and
fometimes produces fome apparent mark in the -fore-teeth j Jupiter, in
an airy fign, gives broad roce-teeth; in a fiery fign, crooked, or dif-
tortedj in an earthy iign, foul teeth j but, in a watery fign, the teeth
decay fuddenly, and grow black and rotten; and this the more certain
if Jupiter be in any bad afpcft of Saturn or Mars, or in conjunction
with the Dragon’s tail.
When Jupiter is fignificator, and pofited in a watery iign, the perfon
is fat and comely $ in an airy fign, more ftrong and corpulent, with a
decent comelinefs and proportion of body; in an earthy fign, a well-
compofed body, not fat nor lean, but a mediocrity, provided he has not
much latitude, and in noafpedt with other planets; but, if in a fiery fign,
the body is rather fquare than corpulent. If Jupiter be fignificator, and
pofited in a watery fign, the perfon has fome impediment in his fpeech,
or fpeaks with great deliberation ; this is the more certain, if in quartile
or oppofition to Mercury.
PERSONS defcribed by MARS in each of the TWELVE SIGNS.
Mars in Aries reprefents a perfon of middle ilature, of a fwarthy
complexion, well fet, large bones, light hair, or fometimes red and cur­
ling, and auftere countenance; if Mars be occidental, the complexion is
more ruddy and the body more fmooth; if oriental, the perfon is taller of
fi.ature, and the complexion not fo fwarthy, and it renders the native
more comely and valiant; in difpofition, Marsin Aries ever fheWs abold,
confident, undaunted, perfon, choleric, lofty, defirous to bear rule over
others, and fcorns to fubjefl himfelf to any perfon; a true lover of war,
and often gains preferment and great advancement thereby.
Mars in ‘Taurus gives a middle-ftatured perfon, well fet, rather ihort
than tall, pretty corpulent, of no clear complexion, brown or black rug­
ged hair, abroad face, wide mouth, generally awell-fe't body, fometimes
ruddy, and marked in the face; it reprefents a profligate perfon, one that
gives himfelf much liberty in all manner of vicious actions, as gaming,

drinking» Wfnphing, fee. and, in fine, a very treacherous, debaqclved,
. ilUnatured,'»unfortunate, perfon, unlcfs the fortunes interpofe their
friendly rays. If Mars be near the Pleiades, this defeription is ag-.
gravated, *
Mars in 'Gemini perfonates a reafonably tall ilature, black or brown
hair; the beginning of thefign gives it lighter; if it falls near Aide-
baran, the complexion is tending to fanguine, the body well proporti­
oned, and the members conformable, but a very unsettled perfon in
tnoft of his actions, yet ingenious in many things, though unfortunate
in all; and generally lives in fome mean condition, fhifting here and
there, exercifing his wits for a livelihood. ‘
I
Mars in Cancer gives a fhort perfon, of bad complexion, brown hair,
and much of it; a difproportioned body, fometimes crooked, and the
condition of the mind for the mod part as crooked; a dull fottiih per­
fon, of few or no commendable atiions„ unfortunate, always engaged
in fome fervile or mean'employment, and is rarely capable of better.
Mars in Leo gives a ftrong able-bodibd perfon, of a fun-burnt com­
plexion, tall, with light fiaxen hair, large limbs, and great eyes; a hafty
choleric perfon, whofe pallion too often overfways his reafon; delights
in warlike exercifes, as Ihooting, riding, fighting, fee. but naturally a
noble generous free-fpirited perfon, efpecially tp fuch as obferve him,
and endeavour to oblige him.
Mars in Virgo give a middle-flatured well-proportioned body, black
or dark brown hair, the complexion fwarthy, and fometimes a fear or
blemiih in the face; a hafty revengeful perfon, too fubjeft to pallion,
and apt to retainaninjury a long time in his memory; very htimourfome
and difficult to be pleafed, conceited, but generally unfortunate in all
or moft of his a&ions. .
Mars in Libra gives a well proportioned body, fomewhat tall, light
brown hair, oval face, and fanguine complexion, a briik chearful af-
pe£t, a lover of the female lex, conceited of his own abilities, inclin­
able to boafting, delights in noble recreations, loves neatnefs in his ap­
parel, and is generally beloved of women, but often to his prejudice.
Mars in Scorpio give* a well-fet middle ftature, black curling hair,
broad face, corpulent body, and fwarthy complexion; in difpfcfition a
No. 19. 4 Y very
3So A N , I L L U S T R A T I O N
very ill-humoured perfon, paifionate, quarrelfome, unfociable, rafh, re­
vengeful, and ungrateful; but, notwithstanding his ill-ttatpre, he has
fotne good qualities intermixed with them;.a perfon of quick and rea­
dy apprchenfion, and becomes excellent in any thing his active fancy
leads him to the infpedtion of. . *

Mars in Sagittarius gives a tall perfon, with a well proportioned body
neatly compaéted, fangnine complexion, brown hair, oval vifage, quick
eye, a perfon of a large heart, and of a choleric hafty difpolitioo, yet
a chearful, merry, jovial, companion, adtive, courageous, loquacious, de­
lights in neatnefs, and loves to hear himfelf applauded by others, and
is in*fine of no contemptible humour or temper. ,
* Mars in Capricorn gives amean flature, a lean body, an ill complexion,
an
d black lank hair, a thin face, little head, but an ingenious perfon, and
of a realbnably good difpofition, a penetrating fancy, and generally very
fortunate and happy in moil of his undertakings.
Mars in Aquaries defcribes one of a well compofed body, reafonably
corpulent, reddifh or fandy-coloured hair, a moderately clear complexion,
middle flature, but of a turbulent fpirit, too much addióted to contro-
verfy, many times to the detriment of body and cítate, if other tefti-
xnonics do not occur.
Mars in P ifies gives a mean iiatured perfon, rather ihort and flcfhy
than otherwife, no handfome body nor good complexion, a light brown
or fair flaxen hair, a fottifh kind of debauched perfon, very dull and
flupid, yet a lover of women, a mere diflcmblcr, an idle companion,
not a friend to himfelf or others.
If Mars be in conjundtion, quartile, or oppofition of Saturn, or with
the Dragon's tail, and they in angles, then the native is more fierce and
violent; in fiery figns he is choleric and hafty, and many times hath a
falling in of the cheeks; in other figns.the face is more full and flefhy*
Mars in earthy figns renders the native of a fullen temper, not courte­
ous or affable; in airy figns, more free and obliging* in watery figns,
fomewhat flupid and fottifh, unlefs he be well beheld of Jupiter, Sol,
or Luna; their friendly afpeóis do fomething meliorate the aforefaid
fignifications, which mull be warily confidered by the ingenious artifl
in his judgment; as alfo the nature of thofe fixfcd ftars that are joined
to the particular figniheators. . *

complexion mixed with white ; the difpofition no lefs pleafant, a very
-jocund perfon, a lover of mirth and recreation, asalfo very well refpe&ed
of the female fex in general. If a woman, ihe will be admired, or at
lead courted by many lovers i yet fubjed to misfortunes, unlefs Venus
be well placed, and in good afped to the Sun, Moon, or Jupiter,
The Moon in Scorpio reprefents an ill-faihioned perfon, thick and
ihort, fleihy, and of a very obfeure complexion, brown or black hair,
and in ihort a very ill-difpofed perfon, and rarely qualified with any
good humours; fottiih, malicious, and treacherous, unlefs alleviated

If a female, ihe rarely lives free from fevere cenfure, and not without
defert, except the Moon be befriended by fome benevolent configuration
of good planets.
The Moon in Sagittarius gives an handfome well proportioned body,
an oval face, bright brown hair, and fanguine complexion ; a generous
free-fpirited perfon, paflionate for a ihort time, ambitious, aiming at
great things, and generally of an obliging temper, and confequently
gains refped of fuch perfons as he or ihe aifociates with.
. The Moon in Capricorn fignifies a perfon of a low ftature, and of an
ill complexion, a fpare thin body and face, brown or black hair; fome*
times a defed or weaknefs in the knees, and at bed no ilrong bodied
perfon; one of fmall a&ivity or ingenuity; inclinable notwithftand-
ing to debauchery and mean aftions, which renders him a perfon of
but low efteem; yet if the Moon receives the friendly rays of Jupiter,
the Sun, or Venus, from good places of the figure, the difpofition is
thereby much corrected.
The Moon in Aquaries gives a perfon of a middle ftature, not tall nor
ihort; but between both ; the body well proportioned, but rather cor*
pulent, brown hair, and clear fanguine complexion ; an ingenious
perfon, of a very affable courteous difpofition, inoffenfive to all, loves
curious and moderate recreation, apt for invention, which confequently
fhews anadive fancy, a pregnant brain, and is rarely guilty of any un­
worthy adion.

Brief OBSERVATIONS in draw
ing aDefcription fromthe PLANET
that is LORD of the ASCENDANT.
I. If noplanet be inafpeft with the lord of the afcendant, thenjudge
of the native by the lord of the afcendant wholly, without any regard
to the flgn in which he is poflted.
II. If the lord of the afcendant be retrograde, or in his fall ordetri­
m
ent, then defcribe the native with due reference to the nature of that
flgn in which he is fopoflted.
III. If the lordof the afcendant behold the afcendant at the tim
e of
birth, thenjudge of the native by the quality of the flgn upon the cufp
of the afcendant.
IV. If two planets happen to be in afpeft with the afcendant, take
your judgm
ent from himwho is m
od perfect in partile, an
d poflted in
his own houfe, rather than fromhim who is in his exaltation.— Thefe
obfervationsare to be confldered as well in regard to the dilpofltion and
qualities of them

A
NATIVITY, or Qeniture, is the very moment of birth, or precife
trote of the child's cominginto the world, and in which he it
made a vifible «M
ember of tire creation. In this moment it is that the
Rare begin to a&and operate their influence upon the new-born infant,
by .the power or intervention of thofc angels who rule and govern the
constellations then level with the horizon, nr that afeend upon the ho»
rofeope, according to that faying of St. Jerome, in his comment upon
the eighteenth chapter of St. Matthew, where he lays, Great is the dig­
nityoffouls, for every one at tbeir jtrfi coming into the worldhave an an­
gel appointedfor tbeir cujlody and fafety. And, as it is from thefe confi­
gurations that we are enabled to point out the incidents of the native’s
future life, to is it abfolutely neoeffary that the very inftant of birth
fhould be wetland minutely ascertained, in order to arrive at corredneft
and certainty in thefe fpeculations. It mud be obvious to every one
that the cdeilial bodies are in perpetual motion, and therefore every
quarter of an hour muff considerably vary their pofition ; as does alfo
different parallels from any one given poiot of the heavens j and hence
it is that the latitude, as well as the true time of birth, becomes fo
abfolutely neceffary in calculating or bringing un abe direéüons of a
• •
nativity.
By knowing the place of birth, the latitude is eafily afeertained ;
but to determine the precife time of a native's emerging from the womb
is a circumftance that has been always found difficult and precarious }
not only on account of the inattentiony f nurfes and midwives to this
moil interefting event, but alfo by reafon of the difference and uncer-.
tainty of almoll all clocks, watdhes, and dials, in reference to the
Sun. Wherefore the ancient profeffors of this art, to remove the
errors in the common or eflimate time of birth, have contrived ie-
veral ways of rcélifying a nativity ¡ and have given fuch rules for this
purpofe, that the true timé of birth may be thereby correctly afeertain­
ed. This rectification may be effected three different ways ¡ firfl, by
the Trutinam Hermetis, or Trutine of Hermes; fecondly, by the Ani­
moder of Ptolomy; and, thirdly, by the naturalaccidents oj the native.
Thefe three methods I fhall explain fully, when I come to treat of the
rectifications of nativities j fumceit here to fay, that the method moftly
in ufe, and which is found liable to the lcafl error, particularly in the
g

O F A S T R O L O G Y . 391
genitures of grow
n perfons, is that of reflifying by fuch accidents a
s
might have-%
efallen them during their pail life.
As the doélrineof nativities is the very eiT
en
ceof Aftrology, and the
principal criterion by whichm
ankindwill judge of the utility and rea-
fonablenefs of the feience, it will berequisite for m
e in this place to be
a
s plainand circum
ilantial a
s pofliblc. It cannot be unentertaining, nor
wholly ufelefs£even to a com
m
onread
er, m
uch lefstothofewho m
eanto
iludy the heart, to know the true grounds upon which this part of the
fcience is founded-, together with thofe a
fjp
e
d
ts or configurations at
birth, fromwhich ourpredictions a
refram
edj an
d the tim
e alfo when
their influence an
d effects will vifibly operate upon the body o
r affairs
of the native. In elucidating this fubject, I ihall be principally guided
by the Quadripartite of the great Ptplom
y ; the truth an
d excellency
of whofe doCtrine the experience of m
any ages, an
d the obfervations of
the m
oil intelligent profeifors of this art, have fully eilablifhed and
confirm
ed.
It is m
anifefl to the m
oil fuperficial obferver, that a certain fecret
pow
er is diffufedthrough all things that are n
ear the earth, according
to the nature an
d properties of the firm
am
ent, an
d circum
am
bient
air, an
d to the pow
er an
d influence of the lum
inaries and other ce-
leilial bodies. The Sun being the fuperior lum
inary an
d the foun­
tain of life, governs all things that b
ear relation to the earth, not only
by varying the feafons, an
d bringing to perfection the feeds of anim
als,
and the fruitfulnefs of plants, the flowing of w
aters and the m
utation
of bodies, but alfo the changes of the day, of heat an
d m
oiflure, of
drinefs an
d cold, a
s it hath refpeC
l to the m
eridian, or m
id-heaven.—
The M
oon alfo, being n
earefl to theearth, diflils dow
n an am
azing in­
fluence, by which things anim
ate an
d inanim
ateareaffcC
tedan
d changed.
Rivers areaugm
entedan
d dim
inifhed according to her light -, the tides
vary a
s fhe rifes an
d fets; plants and anim
als, in whole or in part, in-
creafean
ddecreafe with her. In the fam
e m
anner the ftars, fixed an
d
erratic, a
s they keep o
n their uniform courfe, caufe m
any appearances
around us, for they produce cold an
d heat, an
d w
ind an
d rain, by
which alfo things onearth are fuitably governed; an
dtheir m
utual con­
figurations, a
s their influences co-operate with or oppofe one another,
produce variations accordingly.
The pow
er of the Sun is on all hands adm
itted tobe m
oil prevalent,
a
s it is obvioufly m
oil univerfal. The other heavenly bodies, according
No. 20. 5 B to
A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
392
to the varietyof theirafpedls with the Sun, unite with, o
rr
e
fill,his in­
fluence, agreeable to the nature and force of fuch afpeds. *Xlm hap­
pens m
oil frequently, an
d m
oft forcibly, with the M
oon, at all the
changes. Gut thefe affe&
ions in the ilars operate m
ore obfcurely, an
d
em
ploy longer tim
e, according to their declination, or as they appear or
difappear in our horizon. Hence then, by the rules of nature, an
d the
teilim
ony of our own reafon and experience, it m
uit be adm
itted, that
of all the planets, the influence of tneSun is the m
oil powerful; and
that the influence of the other planets have moil energy, when the
beam
s of the Sun co-operate with them
. The M
oon likewife, by rea­
fon of her fwiftnefs, an
d proxim
ity to the earth, m
odifies an
d conveys
thefe influences to fublunary bodies, with a force fupcrior to all the
other ilars. And thefe influences are alw
ays m
oil powerful, an
d m
oil
vifible in their eflfeds, w
hen this m
ediationof the M
oon is exercifed in
conveying the influences of the ilars to the Sun, or of the Sun to the
other ilars, an
d thence to the earth. But, in defining thefe varying pro-'
perties an
d effeifs, particular regard m
uil be had to the latitude, decli­
nation, rifing, an
d fetting, of the ilars, both fixedan
d erratic, efpccially'
thofe which approach neareil to the ecliptic.
W
hoever contem
plates thefe prem
ifes, an
d attentively obferves the
afpefts, will find that not only conjoined bodies arefubjedt to the confi­
gurations of the ilars, but alfo the buddings an
d perfedlion of feeds are
fram
edan
d form
ed according to the quality with which the heavenly
m
atter an
d circum
am
bient air is endued. The obiervant huibandm
an
an
d ihepherd preconjedure the proper feafon
s for feed-fowing, planting,
an
d procreation of anim
als, by confulting the ilate of the w
inds an
d
the face of the iky. The ikilful m
ariner likewife prepares againil the
dangers of a
napproaching ilorm by fim
ilar obfcrvations; but they are
frequently deceivedfor w
ant of better experience,an
d anadequate know­
ledge of the courfcs an
deffedts of the heavenly bodies, which, when ex­
actly underitood, conduce to an alm
oil certain preicience herein. For
it is found, that he who corredly know
s the m
otions of the ilars, an
d
their configurations with the Sunan
d M
oon, an
d is not ignorant of th
e
tim
es, n
or the place, nor the afpe£ts, and is well ikilled in the fim

hether inim

by the law
s ofnature, but proper an
d neceffary to the wifdoman
d well­

The errors of thofe who do not underftand the fundam

d plaufible reafon
s
to the bulk ofm

sfor the great an

But the confiderationof Nativities, inpoints which relate to the par­

Therefore he who d

ay oftentim
es afford lingular advantage and happi-
nefs to individuals, as well as to ilates and focieties, by being thus time­
ly forew
arned of what ihall hereafter com
e to pafs. And furely I need
not m
ention a ftronger inftance of the advantages of prefeience, than
what will naturally arrfe fromthe obfervationof every m
anof experience
when he looks back upon the occurrences of his pail life, and recoilefts
but half the Ioffes and inconveniences he has fuilained, only for want of
that foreknowledge in worldlyaffairs which theart ofpredi&ion fupptics.
We are not however to believe, that the accidents and events of life
fo befal m
en, as though a law were fet over them by fom
c indiffoluble
caufe from above, by which they are of neceffity brought to pafs, no
other caufe being able to oppofe or prevent them. .It w
ere unphilofo-
phical and abfurd thus to imagine$ for the m
otion of the heavenly bo­
dies isim
m
utable by divine law, and the m
utation of earthly things is
difpofed of and revealed by a natural generationand order, which the i'u-
perior caufe follows by accident. It is alfo to be obferved, that m
any
things happento m
an, not only by reafon of the natural and properqua­
lity of the heavenly m
atter, but alfo by the operation of fom
e m
ore uni-
verfal caufes ; a
s by great m
utations andm
ixtures ofthe elem
ents, plagues
and peftilences, and floods and conflagrations, are produced, by which
multitudes are at once fwept away, and perifh under one common fata­
lity. Thus greater caufes always overcom
e the lefs, and the flronger
the weaker; and, whenever the ftronger power prevails in any great mu­
tation, the m
ore general effedls we have been fpeaking of happen. ■
Other things likewife happen to individuals; becaufethe natural proper­
ty of each isovercom
e by the contrariety of the circumambient m
atter,
whether the antipathy thereofbefm
all or fortuitous. Now, this being
adm
itted, it becom
es apparent thatof thofe things which happen gene­
rally and particularly, be the accident whatever it m
ay, whofe firft
caufe is ftrong and irreiiftable, andno other caufe having power to with-
ftand it, com
e to pafs wholly by neceility. But thofe accidents
which have a weaker caufe are overthrown, if any other caufe, able to
withftand it, is found; and, if fucha refilling caufe appears not, then
thofeaccidents happen agreeableto the nature and im
pulfe of their firft
caufe; and they are produced, not through the ftrength of the caufe, nor
by neceflity, but becaufe the antipathy by which it might have been
deftroyed is neither known nor to be defined. Thus it happens to
all things that have a natural caufe and beginning, as m
etals, ftones,

396 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N .
plants, anim
als, wounds, ficknefs, affections, &c. fom
eof which work
neccffarily, and others not, except when fomcthing is found of fuffici-
ent ftrength to oppofe their efficient pow
er. Hence it is dem
onftrable,
that, though fimplecaufes have natural properties peculiar to them
felves,
yet there areother caufes equally Am
ple, which operate in contadl with
thofe of the form
er, and by which the bare Am
ple nature of each is
changed by m
utation into a third quality which differs in nature from
either of the former; according to which fuch Am
ple natural proper­
ties are either partly or wholly changed, or otherwife fruftrated or di­
verted. As for exam
ple, in the weather, the Sun, in his own Am
ple
nature, is the fountain of light andheat; but, beingjoined with Saturn,
never fails, if not prevented by fom
e other apparent caufe, both in win­
ter an
d fum
m
er, to produce cold and cloudy weather. But, ifM
ars hap­
pens to bejoined in configuration with them, the cafe is altered, and,
inflead of cold, the w
eather will not fail, in fum
m
er, to be hot and ful-
try, though at the fam
e tim
e cloudy, corrufcuous, and diforderly; and,
in winter, rem
arkably clofe and warm
, though lowering and turbulent;
m
ore efpecially if attended with a new or full Moon. Thefe are fads
founded upon a rational hypothefis, and proved by long experience and
conftant obfervation.
Thefe prelim
inaries being laid down, and confidered as the ground­
work ofAftrology, it follows that thofe, who would wifh to be proficient
in it, fhould learntopredid futurities after a natural way, by fuch prefei-
cnce as nature has pointed out, and not by an inconfiderate or vain opi­
nion that this fiiall happen, becaufe it hath m
any great and efficient
caufes which it is im
pofiible to refift; or that this (hall not happen,
becaufe it hath refilling affeftions, Calculators of nativities, therefore,
when they fpeak of thofe things which m
ay com
e to pafs, can do it in
no other way, conform
able to truth and nature, but by the power and
effects of the circum
am
bient m
atter or afpe&s, which, being m
ore or
lefs inclined to atem
perature, will produce fuch an accident, fta-
ture of body, or difpofition of m
ind. As when a phyfician aiferts that
anulcer will eat away or putrefy, or a naturalift that the loaditone will
attract iron ; not becaufe it is neceffary that the ulcer ihould eat away
or putrefy, or the loaditone attract; but, if the contraries are not known
nor their effects prevented, thefe circum
itances will affuredly happen,
according to the caufe and confequences of things, as ‘they have been
from the beginning of the world. Thus it happens, and thus we ought
tpjudge, inthe calculation of nativities; for thofe events which per­
petually tall in upon all hum
an affairs, are produced according to the
lucceffion of natural order, either becaufe things that m
ay oppofe and
prevent
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 397
prevent are not found, or becaufe they are not known. And again,
events known naturally, and according to order, and thofe things being
foundwhich difagree and oppofe, they are then either wholly prevented,
or elfe come to pafs with very fm
all effe£t, and are fcarcely vifible in
their operation.
•
Now, feeing there is both in generals and particulars fuch a confe-
quence, it is curious to rem
ark, that though m
any people believe in
generals, andallow it is poffible to prognosticate upon that fyftem
, and
alfo think it advantageous tow
ards prefervation and health ; yet in par­
ticulars they will not allow the fam
e operations to have any force. .For
m
any confefs they know the proper feafons, and the ligniiication of the
fixed S
tars, and the afpe&s of the Moon, and they obferve them for the
establishm
ent of their health, and to reduce their constitutions to a good
and regular tem
perature, in fum
m
er by cooling m
edicam
ents, and in
winter by heating. They alfo obferve the Significations of the fixed
Stars, for thepurpofes of navigation; and they plant, and fow, and for»
ward vegetation, by obferving the different afpedts of the Moon j and
no one fuppofes thefe general effects either im
pofiible or ufelefs. But
in particulars, a
s of cold or heat, which increafe and decreafe in their
proper tem
per, and by the properties and m
ixtures of other m
atter, they
neither believe it poffible to foretel, or conceive that we m
ay be pre-
ferved from
, the confequences attending them
. But the caufe of this
opinion, is the difficulty of knowing particulars, and the m
anagem
ent
of them
, with precision and truth ; and becaufem
enare feldom found of
fo penetratinga com
prehension, that none of the contraries be hidden
from their view; hence, the oppoiing power of influence for the moil
part not beingjoinedwith a foreknowledge in the effe:t produced by firfl
caufes without im
pedim
ent, they judge of things fimply, a
s though
im
m
utable and im
poflible to be prevented. But as in the art of predic­
tion its poffibility appears worthy of consideration, although it is not
altogether infallible, this prefervative part is certainly worthy of parti­
cular regard, Sin
ce it m
ay bring relief to m
any, though not aperfect cure
toall. For this reafon the Egyptians, finding the efficacy of this art,
every wherejoined phyiic to prognostic aftronom
yj and hence it is ap­
parent, that, if they had thought futurities could not be rem
oved or di­
verted, they would never have preferibed certain rem
edies and perferva-
tives againit the effeft of the am
bient, prefent or to com
e, whether in
general or particular cafes ; they therefore fought out a m
ethod at once
advantageous an
d profitable, that by aitrology the quality of the fubja-
cent tem
peram
ents, and the accidents which com
e to pafs by the influ­
ence of the heavenly bodies, might be difeovered and known; but
i the
398 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
the m
edical art, to diftingtiifh the fim
pathies and antipathies of each,
end to underfland the natural cure of prefent difeafes, and the true
m
ode of preferration from future. For without this fpecies of aftro-
nom
rc knowledgethe m
edical art is foundin m
any cafes to fail j though
I amready to allowthat there are not rem
edies to be found for all bodies
anddifeafes. -
*
Thefe obfervations becom
e clear and obvious, from a confideration
of the planets and their afpeéfs. The Sun is found by nature to caufe
heat and drinefs in a m
oderate degree. His power and influence is moll
viftble to our fenfes, by reafon of his m
agnitude, and the m
anifeft mu­
tation of the feafons¡ for, by how much the nearer he approaches to
our vertical point, by fo m
uch the m
ore he ftirs up heat in us, and
fubjetls us tohis nature. But the nature of the Moon is chiefly moift-
cnirtg; for, being n
earer theearth, ihe exhales the vapours of all m
oift
bodies, and thus evidently affcéts all m
oift things, and putrefies them;
bur, becaofe of her analogy with the Sun, Ihe m
oderately participates of
heat. The planet Saturn cools anddries, becaufe he is far diftant from
the heatof theSun and vapours of the earth; but he cools mod abun­
dantly, and dries moil m
oderately. The other planets alio receive
virtue according to the configurations- they m
ake with the Sun and
Moon. M
ars drieth much, and burns, becaufe of his hot and fiery na­
ture; but the influence of Jupiter is tem
perate, becaufe he m
oves be­
tween the coldnefs of Saturn and the heat of Mars. Venus hath nearly
the fam
e tem
perature, but in a different m
eafure, becaufe of her vicini­
ty to the Sun ; ihe m
oiftens moil, as does the Moon, through the great-
nefs of their light, by which they afiiim
e them
oiiture of the vapours of
the earth. Mercury fom
etim
es dries, and fom
etim
es m
oiftens, according
to his poiition and configuration with other ilars. Hence arife the four
principal hum
ours, from whence all bodies are engendered. Two of
them aregenerative andactive, thehot, andthem
oift ; for by thefe are
all things joined together, and increafcd; and two are corruptive and
hurtful; the dry, and the cold; for by thefe all things are difiblved,
anddeftroyed. W
herefore twoof theplanets, viz. JupiterandVenus, arc
defined to be benefics, becaufe of their benevolent tem
perature, and
becaufe heat and m
oiilure equally abounds in them; and likewise the
Moon, for the fam
e reafons. But Saturn andMars, being of an oppo-
iite nature, are defined to be ofam
alevolent anddeilrudive influence, by
reafon of theextrem
e cold of theone, and the violent heat of the other.
But the Sun and Mercury, being of a controvertible nature, are found to
produce both thefeinfluences, accordingto thenature, force, and quality,
of theafpefts orconfigurations they m
ake withother bodies.

The two apparent diftinftions of tim

s affe&ions, being mixed among them
felves, produces m
any diffe­
rences of quality in the circumambient m
atter which continually fur-
rounds us} the proper and diftinct power of which, alternately prevail­
ing, is changed m
ore or lefs by the force of other configurations. To
thefeeffects, the operation of the fixed ftars in general contaibute not a
little. Thofe of the greateft m
agnitude are the moil powerful and ef­
ficacious ; and thofe inor near the ecliptic havem
ore energy than thofe
rem
ote from it. The bright ftars have m
ore influence than the dull
and languid ; thofe of a red colour partake of the quality of M
ars ;
thofe af a lead colour operate with fim
ilar effect to Saturn ; and fo of
the others, according to their affinitywith the planets, as hath been al­
ready explained. Stars which have northern latitude and declination!
affed us moil; and with South Latitude, the m
ore fouthern. Thofe
fituated in the zenith influence m
ore than thofe which are m
ore re

m
ote ; and fuch as are in partile conjunction or antifcion of any plAet,!
or which rife or fet, or culminate, with any planet, have a m
ore than
ordinary power and influence : but of them
felves the fixed ftars emit no
rays. v. •
• • , • •
The four angles of the horofcope, or cardinal houfes of heaven, from
whence the general winds take their rife, muil likewife be confidered.
The oriental angle is pofleffed of great ¿rinefs; for, when the Sun ar­
rives there, thofe things which werem
oiftenedby thenight beginto dryj
and the winds which blowfrom thence, commonly calledeaft-winds, are
very drying, and without m
oifture. The angleof tbefouth is moil hot,
becaufe the Sun, being there culminate, burns and heats with greater
energy, becaufe our m
id-heaven declines to the fouth wherefore the
winds proceeding from thence, commonly called fouth-winds, are hot
and filling. But the occidental angle is moift, becaufe, when the Sun
arrives there, thofe things which were dried in the day begin to be
m
oiftened j confequently the winds blowing from thence, commonly
called weft-winds, are free from thicknefs or m
oifture. The northern
angleorpoint, lying towards the Bears, is moil cold, becaufethe culmi­
natingSun, inrefpect to that part of the earth which we inhabit, declines
m
oft fromit ; for which rtafon, the winds blowing from that quarter
are generally cold and freezing. The perfed knowledge of thefe things
is very neccffary toenable us to diftinguifh themixtureof particularsj for
’ it
fiuteo
fthe ecliptic in which the Sun is; and cofmical fetting is, whenaftar or planet lets exa&ly
when the Sun rifes. Achronical rifing is, whenaftar rifes above the horizonat Sun fetting ; and
achromcal fetting is, when a ftar fets with the Sun. Heliacal rifing is. when a ftar, which before
hidden by the rays of the Sun, begins toappear inthe eaft ;andheliacal fetting is, when a ftar,
which beforewas fecn, hiddenunder the Sun-beams, and difappears.
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 401
it is apparent, that, according to the conftitution of the feafons, of ages,
and of the angles, the efficient power and influence of the ftars varyj
and, when there is no contrary conftitution, the ftars have a longer
influence, becaufe it isunm
ixed j for, in heating, they that arem
ofthot
are m
oft powerful j and, in m
oift conftitutions, thofe arethe m
oft pow­
erful which are ofi a moiftening nature. But, when the conftitution is
contrary, they are weaker, by reafon of the tem
peram
entand mixture of
contrariety, affe&ed by the heating ftars in cold conftitutions, and by
the m
oift in dry. In the fam
e m
anner each of the other conftitutions
have power, according to the proportions of their m
ixtures. To thefe
we m
ay join the m
utual properties of the twelve figns of the zodiac ;
for their general tem
peratures areagreeable to the feafons fubjeft to each
fign ; and they obtain fom
e other qualities ariflng from their analogy to
the Sun, Moon, and ftars ; and thefe confiderations of the agreem
ent or
difagreementof the natures and m
ixtures of the various influences of the
ftars, figns, and parts of heaven, are of no fm
all confequence in aftrolo-
gical contem
plations.
Of the twelve figns, fom
e are term
ed tropics, fom
e equino&ial, fom
e
fixed, and others bicorporal. The tropics are two; the firft from the
fum
m
er folftice, the thirty degrees of Cancer ; and the other from the
winter folftice, the thirty degrees of Capricorn. Thefe are called tro­
pics, becaufe, when the Sun is pofited in the beginning of thefe figns, he
turns back out of the courfe of latitude or declination to the contraries,
making fum
m
er by his entering into Cancer, and winter by his paffage
into Capricorn. There are alfo two of the figns equinodtial; one from
the vernal equinox, which is Aries ; the other from the autum
nal
equinox, which is Libra. Thefe arc foterm
ed, becaufe, whenevever the
Sun enters the beginning of them, he m
akes the days and nights equal
all the world over.
Of the other eight figns, four arefixed and four bicorporal. The fixed
are thofe which follow the tropical and equinoHial ; becaufe, when the
Sun is pofited in any of thefe, the cold or heat, or drinefs or moif-
ture of the feafons, which began while the Sun w
as in the tropics or

Again, fix of the twelve figns are nam
ed m
afculine gild diurnal ; and
fix fem
inine and nofiurnal. And becaufe the night isalways next to
the day, and the fem
inine is joined to the mafculine, they are placed
one after another by turns. The beginning is taken from Aries, be­
caufe the m
oiilure of the fpring is the beginning of the feafons; and
becaufe the m
afculine virtue is predom
inant, and the adtivepower before
the paffive ; therefore the figns Aries and Libra are efteem
ed mafcu-
Jine and diurnal; for thefe defcribe the equinodtial circle ; and the prim
e
m
utation, and ftrongeft m
otion of allj is caufed by them. The other
figns are alternately placed one after another in their proper order ; and,
fromthe formandquality of them, fom
e are term
ed four-footed, others
terrcilrial; fom
e commanding, and others fruitful. And, to renewthem
in the m
ind of the reader, it m
ay not be im
proper to diflinguiih them
here. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquaries, are m
af­
culine andcommanding. Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn,
and Pifces, are fem
inine and obeying. Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius,
and Capricorn, are four-footed. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are
terreftrial. Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces, are fruitful. Again, Aries,
Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, are term
ed m
oveable. Taurus, Leo,
Scorpio, and Aquaries, fixed. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pifces,
com
m
on. Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, vernal. Cancer, Leo, and
Virgo, eilival. Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, autum
nal. Capricorn,
Aquaries^ and Pifces, hyem
nal. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, are hot,
dry, andfiery. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are cold, dry, and earthy.
Gemini, Libra, andAquaries, are hot, moiit, and airy. Cancer, Scorpio,
Pifces, Gemini, and Leo, aremoiil and watery j and Virgo is barren.
Now from this difpofition and tem
perature of the figns are brought
about the great ends and purpofes of nature, by m
eans of the afpedis and
pofitions of the planets configurated in them and it is upon thefe
afpedts and configurations that the art of predidting is grounded, and
the events of futurity fought out and known. Thefe afpedts are of two
forts, or claffcs, viz. zodiacal and m
undane. The principal zodiacal
afpedts arethe fextile, quartile, trine,_
andoppofition ; and, though the
conjundtion cannot properly "b
e term
ed an afpedt, yet it m
ay com
e un­
derthe m
oregeneral nam
e of a familiarity, com
m
on to all the afpedts.
The conjundtion is form
ed by two planets being bodily joined, orm
eet­
ing in the fam
edegree andm
inute of a fign. The fextile is form
ed by
two planets when they are two figns, or fixty degrees, afunder; the
quartile, when three figns, or ninety degrees, afunder ; the trine, when
four figns, or one hundredand twenty degrees, afunder; and the oppo­
fition, when fix figns, or one hundred and eighty degrees, aiunder ;
which
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 403
which being juft one half of the great circle, places the planets exa&ly
facing one another. The fm
aller or inferior zodiacal afpe&s are the
fem
iquadrate of forty-five degrees; the quintile, of feventy-two degrees;
the fefquiquadrate, of one hundred and thirty-five degrees; and the
biquintile, of onehundred and forty-four degrees. And thefe are either
partite or platic; partile, when the conjunction or afpeft is m
ade in
the fam
e degree and m
inute, and platic when not configurated in the
fam
e degreeand m
inute, but only within the orbs of the afpefting pla­
net. M
oreover, thefe afpefts are either dexter o
r iinifter; dexter, when
contrary to the fuccefiion of the figns, a
s a planet in Leo calls a fpxtile
dexter to another planet in Taurus. Sinifter afpeits are according to
the fuccefiion of the figns; agreeable to which, a planet in Aries calls
his trine finifter toanother in Leo; or one in Leo calls a trine finiller
to another in Sagittarius.
M
undane afpedls are thofe which are m
ade in the m
eridional circle,
in reference to the earth, and confill of only the fextile, quartile, trine,
and oppofition; though there are other fam
iliarities which w
e call pa­
rallels, an
d thefe both m
undane and zodiacal. Of thefe fam
iliarities,
the conjunction is good with benevolent liars; but with m
alevolent bad.
The quintile, biquintile, fextile, and trine, arealfo good and fortunate;
but the fem
iquadrate, fefquiquadrate, quartile, and oppofition, are evil
and unfortunate. Thefe good an
d evil influences proceed m
ore from the
nature an
d quality of the ilars, than from the nature of the figns they
poflefs; for it is found that evengoodafpe6lsof m
alefic planets will pro­
duce m
ifehief, though not in fogreat adegree a
s the evil configurations.
ZodiacaL-parallels are what are com
m
only called Antifcians, and are
nothing m
ore than parallels of declination, or two points in the hea­
vens at equal dillances from the beginning of any of the tropics, or
equinoctial points. For example; one planet in ten degrees of Aries,
and another in twenty degrees of Pifccs, are in zodiacal parillel to each
other; or, in other words, one planet in twenty degrees of PiIces calls
its antifeian, or one parallel, to ten degrees of Aries, an
d its contra-anti-
feian, or another parallel, to tendegrees of Libra. But, in taking thefe,
particular attention mud behadto eachof the planets latitude, for want
of which, great errors have been frequently m
ade. For, fuppofe the
Moon to be polited in twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees
of north latitude, her antifeian, or zodiacal parallel, taken in the com
­
m
on way, would fall in eight degrees of Leo, an
d her contra-ancifcian
in eight degrees of Aquanes; w
hereas the true antifeian falls in ten
degrees of Cancer, which is no lefs than twenty-eight degrees fromthat
No. 20. 5 E obtained
4©
4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
obtained in the com
m
on way, for there is exa&ly that difference be*
tween the ecliptical longitude of twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with*
out latitude, and twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees of
north latitude.
A planet thus confidered, as having latitude, hath four zodiacal paral- t
Ids} oneat its body, one at its antifcional point, and the other two at '
their oppofite points. And hence, according to the exam
ple above
ftated, the Moon’s parallels at her body fall in twenty degrees of Ge­
mini, and at the antifcional point in ten degrees- of Cancer; an
d their
oppofite points orcontra*antifeians, fall in twenty degrees of Sagitta-
rious, and in ten degrees of Capricorn. Thefe antifeians, and contra-
antifcians, are always of a benign and friendly nature, when form
ed by
the benefic planets j but they areequally unbenignandunfortunate, when
m
ade by violent andm
alevolent ftars.
As zodiacal parallels are only equal difiances from the tropical and
equinoftial circles, fo m
undaneparallels, by a parity of reafon, are no­
thing m
ore than a like equal diftance from the horizontal or.m
eridional
points or. circles. For exam
ple, a planet on the cufp of the twelfth
houfe is inparallel tothe cufp of the fecond. houfe, becaufe it is cxa&ly
at the fam
e diftance from the afeendant or horizon that the twelfth is;
qn
d likewife in parallel to the eighth houfe, as being exa&ly the fam
e
diftance fromthe tenth houfe or m
eridian that the twelfth is. And, as
the zodiacal parallels are m
eafured by the circle of the zodiac, fo the
m
undane parallels arem
eafured by the diurnal of nofturnal arches; for
juft fo long a
s the Sun or any other planet will be in proceeding from
the cufp of the twelfth houfe to the cufp of the tenth, juft fo long the
fam
e Sun orother planet will be in proceeding, on the fam
e day, from
the cufpof the tenth to the cufpof the eighth houfe; andjuft fo m

thing but the diurnal arch, which the m
eridian^'or Sun’s placeat noon,
cuts into two equal partsj and the diftance between the Sun’s fettingand

undane parallels have a

ple, and according to natural
order; an

Now there are figns diffociateand-ieparate; and thefe are fuch as
have nofam

at all partake of the afpedts, either by oppofition, trine, quartile, or
Textile. Hence they are term
ed injuB ', for, beingconfigurated by one
fign’s diftance, they areas it were diftorted from each other; and thofe
which behold by five figns divide the whale circle of the zodiac into
unequal parts. The figns under this defeription, are Aries, Gemini,
Libra, andSagittarius, which have no fam
iliarity or afpefts with Taurus
or Scorpio; and the figns, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pifces, have
nofam
iliarity with Leoor Aquaries. *
But the planets h
.ave fam
iliarity with all parts of the zodiac by
Houfes, Trigons, Exaltations, andTerms. Cancer an
dLeo, approaching
nearer to our vertical point than either of the others, and thereby pro­
ducing heat and warm
th, are for that reafon defined to be the houfes of
the two great and prim.ry luminaries: Leo is attributed to the Sun as
m
afeuline, and Cancer to the Moon a
s fem
inine. Hence the fem
i­
cide!c of the zodiac from Leo to Capricorn is term
ed folar, an3 from
Aquaries to Cancer lunar, in order that each planet ihould poflefs one
fign for its houfe in each ofits fem
icircles ; the one bearingconfiguration
to the Sun, and the other to the Moon, according to the m
otion of the
fphereof each, and to their natural qualities. Saturn, therefore,, being
in nature .cold, and inim
ical to.heat, occupying the~higheft orb, and
being at the greatell difiance fromthe lum
inaries, takes for his houfes
the ligns which are oppofite to Cancer and Leo, nam
ely, Aquaries and
Capricorn, becaui'e thefe figns are by nature cold and wintery, and the
afpetis which are m
ade by oppofition do not com
bine to.any good or
benevolent purpofe. Jupiter, becaufe his orb is next below that of
Saturn, afT
u
m
es for bis houfes the two next figns, Sagittanus and.Pifcee,
which are windy andfruitful, by reafon of their trigonal refpect to the
lum
inaries, which is a fituation proper for the produdtion of go

*
Mars, being next fa order to Jupiter, and dry by m
ature, takes for his
houfes the two next figns, Ariesand Scorpio, which are fim
ilar in their
etifed
ts to Mars, by having m
alefic and m
ifehievous radiations with the
lum
inaries. Venus, being tem
perate, has for her houfes the two n
ex-t
figns, Taurus and Libra, which are of a fruitful and prolific nature,
and correfpond with the lum
inaries by a Textile fay, and is never m
ore
than two figns diftantfromthe Sun. Mercury, being circumfcribcd by
theorbs of all theother planets, takes for his houfes Gemini and Virgo,
and is never m

firft planet next him.
The

The fam
iliarities by triplicity are next to beconlidered by calculators
of nativities; for w
hereas a triplicity and figure of equal fides obtains
an agreem
ent, fo the circle of the zodiac is circum
scribed by three
circles, the equinoctial and the two tropics, and is divided into four
equilateral triangles, which conftitute thefe triplicities. The firft is
form
ed by the three m
afeuline figns, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; and
it has for its lords, the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars; but M
acs being of a
contracyjua.tU

3piflflucnce>he is excluded from bearing any
government in this triplicity, and therefore the Sun has the rule by
day, and Jupiter by night. Aries occupies the equinottial circle, Leo
the eftival, and Sagittarius the winter. This trigon is principally
northern^by re^
fon of the dom
inion of Jupiter; and it is windy and
fruitful. It is alfo north-weft, and receives^am
ixture of the north-weft
winds, becaufe it is the houfe of Mars, whichplanet ftirs up and governs
thofe winds.
The fecond triplicity, which confifts of Taurus, Virgo, and Capri­
corn, is under the governm
ent of the Moon and Venus. The Moon
governs by night, and Venus by day. Taurus is in the eftival circle,
Virgo in the equino&ial, and Capricorn in the winter. This triplicity,
becaufe of the dom
inion of Venus, isJouth; for this ftar, being endued
with a warm
ing and moiftening power, produces fouth winds; and be­
caufe Saturn has his houfe in Capricorn, in this triplicity, it likewife
partakes of a m
ixtureof the eaft winds ; for Saturn, being fam
iliar tothe
oriental parts, by reafon of the condition of the Sun, produces and go­
verns the eaft winds.
The thirdtriplicity is form
edof the figns Gemini, Libra, and Aqua-
ries, three m
afeuline figns, and is placed under the governm
ent of
Saturn and Mercury; Saturn rules by day, and Mercury by night;
Gemini is fituate in the fum
m
er circle, Libra in the equinoctial, and
Aquaries in the winter. This triplicity is chiefly eaftern, on ac­
count of the governm
ent of Saturn; but it becom
es partly north-eaft,
by the influence of Jupiter, onwhich account it afium
es a m
ixture of the
north-eaft winds.
The fourth triplicity, confifting of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifccs, is
chiefly under Mars, who derives an influence here, on account of
having his houie in Scorpio; but, becaufe the figns in this triplicity are
fem
inine, the M
oon by night, and Venus by day, rule jointly with
Mars, and interm
ix their qualities and influence together. Cancer is
fituate in the eftival circle, Scorpio in the winter, and Pifces in the
3 equinoctial.
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 407
This triplicity is weftern, becaufe of the dom
inion of M
ars and .the
Moon ; but, affirm
ing a m
ixture by the rule of Venus, it becom
es in
fornem
eafure fouth-well.
The fam
iliarities by exaltation are thus occafioned ; the Sun, when
he enters Aries, m
akes his tranfit into the high and northern fem
icircle ;
but, when he enters Libra, he palfes into the low and fouthern femicir­
cle. For this reafon, the Sun has his exaltation in Aries, in which the
days beginto lengthen, and the heating nature of the Sun begins to in-
creafe; andfor the contrary reafon he receives his fall in Libra. Saturn,
beingof an oppoiite nature to the Sun, has anexaltation in Libra’
, and
his fall in Aries; for, wherefoever heat is increafed, cold is diminiihed ;
and, where there is an augm
entation of cold, heat is lefiened. So the
Moon, becaufe Ihe m
akes her conjunction with the Sun in Aries, and
m
akes the beginning of the increafe of her light in the full fign of her
triplicity, which is Taurus, that is aifigned for her exaltation. So Ju­
piter, the producer of northern and fruitful winds, when in Cancer, be­
com
es m
ore northerly, and acquires a greater increafe of power ; he
therefore takes Cancer for hisexaltation, and Capricornforhis fall. And
fince M
ars is chiefly of a burning nature, and becom
es moll heating in
Capricorn, becaufe he is then in his moftfouthern declination, he hath
his exaltation in Capricorn, oppoiite to that of Jupiter, and his fall in
Cancer. Again, Venus is naturally moillening, but moftly fo when in
Pifces •, for which reafon ihe affum
es her exaltation in that fign, and
takes herfall in Virgo. But Mercury being of an oppofite nature, and
moftly dry, takes the oppofite fign Virgo for his exaltation ; forthen
autum
n, the drieft partof the feafon, appears; and he has his fall inthe
fign Pifces.
Fam
iliarities by term
s have been already largely explained in the
form
er part of this work. But it is neceflary to rem
ark, that the be­
ginning of the figns, andof the term
s alfo, ought to be m
ade from the
beginning of the equino&ial andtropical figns; and this is manifeil, be­
caufe we fee their natures, and powers, and fam
iliarities, have not any
other caufe, but from the tropics and equinoxes ; for, if other begin'
nings are appointed, we ihall either be neceflitated to ufe the nature of
the figns.no longer in the theory of judgments, or, if w
edoadm
it them
,
we Ihall commit error by corrupting the diftances, and dividing thofe
from which influences are afforded them
.
Bcfides thefe fam
iliarities of the liars and figns, they alfop
olT
efs what
arecalled their faces, thrones, and the like. Their properface is when
No. 20. 5 F each
4o8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
each ilarkeeps the fam
efigure with theSun and Moon which its houfe
bears to their houfe. This is done when Venus m
akes a fexangular
figure to the luminaries; to the Sun w
hen ihe is occidental, and to
the M
oon when oriental, according to the fucceflion of houfes. They
arealfo faid to be intheir thrones, when they have apower in the place
they poffefs,-according to the foregoing prerogatives, by two or m
ore
teftim
onies; for then their energy and influences are increafed, becaufe
thefam
iliarity of theam
bient twelve figns co-operates therewith. They
are likewifefaid tobein theirjoy, when, although they have no fami­
liarity with the am
bient figns, yet are fo in refped to others of the fam
e
condition with them
, an
d by which likenefs there is found a com
m
uni­
cation by fym
pathy. So again, w
hen they are found of an unlike and
contrary condition, m
uch of their pow
er is dim
inifhed by a new and
m
ixed virtue arifing from the different tem
perature of the am
bient figns.
Hence let it be underftood, that, when Mercury is one fign diftant from
the Sun, he is in his face ; Venus, when two figns diftant; Jupiter,
when four figns diftant ; an
d Saturn, when five figns from the Sun.-—
The fam
e observation holds good in refped of the Moon, but then the
rule mud be m
ade in figns antecedent to her ; as, if the Moon w
ere in
Virgo, then Mercury would befo dignified in Leo, Venus in Cancer,
M
ars in Gemini, &c. The thrones of the planets are thefe : Saturn’s
throne isinAquaries ; Jupiter’s in Sagittarius; Mars’s in Scorpio ; the
Sun’sinLeo; Venus’s in Taurus; Mercury’s in Virgo; and the Moon’s
in Cancer.
The fam
iliarities, by application andfeparation, are likewife tobecon-
fidered in the Dodrine of Nativities. Thofe planets which precede
apply to thofe which follow ; an
d they that follow feparate fromthofe
which precede. Thefe applications an
d reparations arc likewife to be
confidercd with refped to their latitude ; for the fm
aller the latitude of
planets in conjundion is, the m
ore powerful will be their influence ;
and, if two planets in conjunction have confiderable latitude of different
denom
inations, their influence will be thereby much leffened. This
obfervation likewife holds good in directions; for, the n
earer any pla­
net is to the ecliptic line, the greater will his influence be. M
oreover,
their effects are either ftrong or weak, in refped of the horizon ; for,
w
hen they are pofited in the m
id-heaven, or pafs into the place fucce-
dent to the m
id-heaven, they are very ftrong and powerful ; the fam
e
alfo if they a
rein the horizon itfelf, or in any of the fuccedent houfes,
andm
ore particularly when inoriental parts. But, when they are inthe
im
um tceli, or otherwife pofited under the earth, their influence .is very
weak, and of but little effed.
1 From
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 409
From all the foregoing confiderations, it is evident that the efficient
power of theftars is deduced from their peculiar and natural afpe&s.
or proportional diftances, confidercd in refpeCt of the Sun, the angles,
and the quality of the am
bient figns; and by the power and influence of
thefe afpeits are all aftrological fpeculations governed. But how thefe
afpects were firftdifcovered, and theirvirtues andproportions afcertained,
does no where appear.; though it might be no difficult talk to account
for both upon pnilofophical and m
athem
atical principles, fince nature
every where, as well in the m
otions and effeCls of the heavenly bodies,
a
s iu all other arithm
etical and geom
etrical rcfpe&s, particularly cele­
brates thofe proportions above all others; Picus, fpeaking ofthe afp
e’Cts,
thinks m
ankind w
ere led to the knowledge of them by obferving the
different phafes of the Moon ; for, when the is new, horned, in her
quarters, gibboffity, or at full, her form
s are ftill changed at thefe
proportioneddiftances from the Sun ; befides which, it is tobe obferved,
that in her annual revolutions (he is conftantly found about the trine of
her own place in the beginning of the form
er year.
Other aftronom
ers, of eftabliffied reputation, have likewife obferved,
that nature particularly points to every configuration, while w
e confider
the m
otions of the other planets. Abohazer judicioufly affirm
s, that
the two inferior planets, in their ftations, deferibe the arch proper to a
quartile afpeft ; and Pliny alfo recom
m
ends to our obfervation the trine
afpeCt, conftantly form
ed by the ftations of three fuperior planets.
But, above all, it cannot be confidered without great adm
iration, how
wonderfully nature hath nobilitated all the afpeC
ts in the m
otions of
Saturn andJupiter. For, a
s their conjunctions are rare, andhappen bu^
once in twenty-years, fo hath n
atu
re, everm
ore difpofed thefe conjunc­
tions in the m
oft rem
arkable parts of the zodiac, that is, in fuch figns
only as behold each other in an equilateral triangle inferibed. For, be­
tweenany two great conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, there are nine­
teen Egyptian years, three hundred and eighteen days, and thirteen
hours, in which fpace of tim
e thofe planets are m
oved fromthe place
of their form
er conjunctions eight figns and alm
oft three degrees; which?
excefs of three degrees is the caufe why, aftertenconjunctions, they pafs
from one triplicity to another, and one triplicity continues one hundred
ninety-eight equal years, two hundred fixty-five days, (the intercalary
day ofevery fourth year omitted,) and ten hours. But the revolution of
all the triplicities is finiihed only once in feven hundred ninety-four
equal years, three hundred thirty-one days, andfixteen hours; or other-
wife in feven hundred ninety-four Julian years, one hundred thirty-
threedays, and fixteen hours; which, being doubled, am
ounts to one
thoufand
410 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
thoufand five hundredand eighty-eight, which num
ber of years thofe
authors are thought to have refpcdted who confidered the year 1588
from thebirthof Chrift would prove fo fatal.
'From hence therefore it is, and not without fufficient caufe, that
they are term
ed great conjun&ions, both happening rarely, and abiding
in one triplicity a1moil two hundred years together, and not compleat-
ing all the triplicities of the zodiac in much lefs than eight hundred
years: confequently they have not yet gone through all the triplicities
eight tim
es fince the beginning of the world. Neither are the other
afpefts form
ed by thefeplanetsto pafs unnoticed; for whoever obfcrves
when Saturn and Jupiter behold each other by an oppofition.or quartile
afpect, they will evidently perceive that they /till carry fuch a regard
to the figns or places of their preceding and next conjunctions, a
s ever­
m
ore to irradiate the one an
d the other with an oppofition, Textile,
quartile, or trineafpect; which I think is a fufficient proof that nature
hath allured u
s to the confideration of the archs form
ed by thefe afpects
in the particular m
otion of each refpective planet.
To confirmthe virtues an
d effects of thefe afpects, we need only con-
fider what phyficians are taught by experience, nam
ely, that the crifis
of all acute difeafes has a palpable and extraordinary fympathy with
all thele five configurations of the Moon, m
ade to her place at the be­
ginning of the difeafe. Or, a
safurther proof, we need only refer to
what has already been faid relative to the tides, which conftantly
obferve the m
otions of the Moon, their fpring and higheft floods al­
ways concurring with their conjunction and oppofition to the Sun, as
the neaps an
d lowed tides always do to her quarters. And it is
equally rem
arkable that the feas, in their daily ebbing and flowing upon
every coail, have refpect only to fuch azim
uthal circles, as are in a
quartile pofition whenthe Moon paffes by them
. Again, the Sun moil ^
evidently m
anifefts great effects by the quartile afpect, fince he modi-*
fies an
d governs the viciflitudes of feafons, or four quarters of the
year, by his ingrefs into the four equinodtial and tropical points of
the zodiac.
The pow
er of thefe afpects is not injudicioufly dated by Julius
Firmicus, in thearithm
etical obfervation which he m
akes of the num
­
ber of figns agreeable to the afpects, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, anfwering in pro-
greffive ord
er to the conjunction, Textile, quartile, trine, and oppofi-
tion ; for thefe num
bers only, and no others, will divide the zodiac,
confiding of twelve figns; for which reafon he m
akes them the only
aliquot
O P A S T R O L O G Y . 4.11
aliquot parts of acircle. Ptolemy alio added not a little to the dignity
of thefe irradiations, when he firft difcovercd the geom
etrical propor­
tion which the fubtenfes of each of thefe archs bear in refpe£t to the)
diam
eter of a circle. Others again, with no lefs ingenuity, have ob-
ferved, that, am
ongft all tegular or ordinate figures that m
ay beinfcribed
in acircle, though the fam
ebe infinite, there are none whofe fides and
angles carryaway theprerogative at the circum
ference and centre, but
thofe whofe fides and angles are anfw
erable to the fubtenfes and archs
of their afpeds. For, amongil all ordinate planes thatm
ay be infcribed,
thereare no two whofe'fides joined together have pre-em
inence to oc­
cupy al'em
icircle, but the hexagon, quadrate, and equilateral triaftgle,
anlwering to the Textile, quartile, and trine irradiated. The fubtenfe
therefore of a Textile afpe6l confiils of two Tigns; and, joined to the fub­
tenfe of a trine, com
pofed of four, being regular and equilateral, take
up fix iigns, which is a com
plete fem
icircle. In like m
anner, the
fiaes of a quadrate infcribed, fubtending three figns, and, twice reckoned,
alfo occupy the moiety of acircle. And what the foregoing figures are
faid to perform
, either doubled orjoined together, m
ay alfo be found
in the afpcft of oppofitionj for the diam
etrical line which paffes from
the place of conjundion to the oppofite point, divides acircle into two
equal parts, a circum
ftance which cannot be found inanyother infcripts.
For exam
ple, the fide of a regular pentagon fubtends feventy-two de­
grees; of anodtagon but forty-five; the rem
aindersof which archs, viz.
one hundred and eight, and one hundred andthirty-five, degrees, are not
fubtended by the fides ofany ordinatefigure.
And thus, as the fubtenfes of thefe afpefls are the fam
e with the fid
es.
of the foregoing infcripts, and only take up the circum
ference of a
circle; T
oit is evident, that the angles at which they concur are the
fam
e wherewith theordinate planes take up the whole fpace about the
centre. For, if we confider the angleof a Textile afpedt at theearth, it
is all the fam
e with that of an equilateral triangle confiding of fixty
degrees, an
d contains two-thirds of a Tight angle; but fix tim
es tw
o.
thirds of aright angle m
ake four right angles; w
herefore fix Textiles,
equal to fix equilateral triangles, fill the whole fpace about a point,
wnich is equal to four right angles. Secondly, every angle of a
quartile is a right angle, and the fam
e with -the angle of a rectangle
quadrilater figure, four of which fill a wholefpace. Thirdly, the angle
which two liars in a trine m
ake at thecentre of the earth, is m
eafured
by anangle of one hundred and twenty degrees, which is equal tothe
angle of a regular hexagon, confiding of a right angle and one-third;
and, taken three times, m
akes four right angles; whereof three equila-

12 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
teral hexagons, or three trine afpeds, alfo fill the whole fpace about the
centre. To thefe we m
ay likewife add the afped of oppofition; which
confifts of two right angles, and therefore being doubled will perform
the like operationwith the reft; whilft any other figure ofm
any angles,
however joined together, will either fall ihort of four right angles, or
elle exceedthem
. Forinftance, the angle of a pentagon contains a right
angle and one fifth over, wherefore threefuchangles placedabout-apoint
will fall ihort of four right angles by two fifths of a right angle ; whilft
on the other hand four fuch angles will exceed four right angles by
fourififths.
Thefe fpeculations therefore duly confidered, it w
ere fenfelefs to im
a­
gine that nature hath fo m
any ways diftinguiihed thefe rem
arkable irra­
diations of the ftars in vain, or adm
oniihed us to a particular regard of
them, by fo m
any rare and fecret operations, as well in the m
otion of
the planets, a
s in their effcfts and proportions, if they w
ere not endued
with m
ore force and virtue than any of the others. Hence it has given
fcope to the ingenuity andabilities of the learned to affign a caufe, why
thefe few configurations, above all the others, ihould be endued with
fuch extraordinary efficacy. Nor has any reafon yet been given, with
m
ore apparent probability, than that thefe proportions, whereof the
afpeds arcfound to conlift, arcprecifely the fam
e with thofc which are
found in harm
onical concords; for which reafon it is fuppofed no lefs
probable, that the rays of the ftars inthefeproportioned distances, Ihould
powerfully affed the m
atter of all fublunary things, by the fam
e rule
that the like geom
etrical fymmetry in founds and voices ihould ftir up
the fenfc andpaffions of the hearer. And it is an eftabliftted obfervation
throughout the produdions of nature, that, where due proportion is
not wanting, there ihe never fails to endue all her efifeds with fuch an
height of perfedion, a
s cannot but ftrike the fenfeand underftanding of
every obferver. And thus it is even in artificial coropolitions, and in
medicines; for we know thefe only to be m
oft kind and fovercign,
which obferve acom
petent fymmetry or tem
perature of the adive and
paffive qualities. With great propriety, therefore, and with every ap­
pearance of truth, m
oft of the learned agree with Ptolomy, that the caufe
of this wonderful efficacy in the foregoing afpeds, proceeds in a great
m
eafure fromharm
onical proportion. .
But m

the proportions of the afpe6ts, andthe tike diftances obferved in mufical

anner, by com
paring the diapafon with both thefe parts,
that is, with the icfquialter and fefquitertia, according to the cuftom
ary
m
anner of fupputating proportions, we are brought to the two other
com

tural diftances in harm
onical founds, that, being, diverfly andjudicioufly
varied between them
felves, produce an infinite variety of ail kinds of
m
elody.
After the fam
e m
anner we find it with regard to the light and in­
fluence of the heavens. For, although there are other afpe.ts attributed
to the ftars, both zodiacal and m
undane, yet thefe five wereanciently, and
areeven now, obferved as being m
oft apt to adion, andm
oft powerful in
their effe&s, nam
ely, the conjun&ion, oppofition, trine, quartile, and
Textile; an
d there is nothing m
orecertain, than that by the barm
onical
m
ixture of thefe proportioned beam
s, the generation and corruption of
this m
ortal world is infinitely varied and governed. W
herefore, as the
force of all harm
ony, fo likewife the effectual reafonofall adtion in the
influenceofthe fta
r&
, is properly deduced from the aforefaid fym
raetry
of thefe diftances. But, m
ore fully to illuftrate that the angles of the
alpefts, com
pared between them
felves, concur with thefe harm
onic pro­
portions inm
ufic, let it be rem
em
bered, that ftars in an oppofite or dia­
m
etrical aipett are disjoined by the ipacc of two right angles, which
arem
easured with the arch of itx figns, or onehundred and eighty de-
giees of circumference; and that the trine, confifting of four figns, or
one
4t4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
one hundred and twenty degrees, conftitutes one right angle and. one
third of another; alfo, that the quartile afpedt takes up odf* entire right
angle, and is fubtended with the archof three figns, or ninety degrees;
and likewife that a Textile is conftituted’ but of two figns, or fixty de­
grees, which is two thirds of a right angle. This being admitted, if
we now compare the two right angles of the oppofition, taken toge­
ther with the angles of the reft of the afpedts, and either thetrine placed
between the oppolition and*the quartile, or the quartile between
the oppofition and the feknle, we ihall find either way three num­
bers which admit all the laws of harmonic proportion, as becomes evi­
dent by the following figures*.
8 a o 8 o *
;8o 120 90 180 90 60
The firft figure fufficiently explains itfelf; but in the fecond, let the
oppofition be compared with the Textile, and it will be found to have a
triple proportion to the fame, compounded of a double and fefquialter
proportion, as diapente is with diapafon in mufic; and hence it is founcf
no fimple or perfett afpedt, but exadlly anfwerable to B flat, the firft
imperfedt or compounded concord in mufic, being a fixth from G fo l re
u t; which is neverthelefs in fome refpeds efteemed perfedl, becaufe it
bears the fame divifion, compared to Dfo l re, as the perfedt concords do;
for it is half a fifth, and fituate in the centre between r ut and Dfo l re.
Again, the Textile afpedl compared with the trine, ¡6juft one half there­
of, which has beenalready proved to be in a fefquialter proportion to
the oppofition, as D fo l re is to r ut, and therefore exactly correfponds
with the diapente in mufic, which I here take occafion to mention
* Tbe firft figure proves the three concords to have three perfeit afpedts; and the fecond
(hewsthetextile to be animperfed afpedt, agreeable to diapentecm diapafon, thatis,atriplepro­

again, bocaeftjl may hereafter allude to it when I come to fpeak of the
new afpecta./. What I have already faid will fufHce to Chew the philo-
fophical fpeculation of thofe who have afcribed the efficacy of the pla­
netaryirradiation« tothe harmonical proportionswhich arefound between
themj and, iinee it is.obvious that thefe afpects do really hear the fame
mutual refpect one toward« another as all harmonipal concords are found
to retain among themfelves, what rcafon ctt be affigncd, why nature'«
operations in the lights and influences of th«heavenly bodies fhould not
begoverned by this fymmetry of proportion, in the fame manner as we
find to be univerfally admitted in the fcience of mufic ?
But all this ratherferves to illuflrate a fimile, and to prove that nature
has indeed diftinguiihed thefe proportions with extraordinary virtues
above any other, than to fatisfy the mind v
»
b
y
%in the infinite variety of
founds and lights, thefe proportions only fhould correfpond fo fweetly
in mufic, and be m
od: effectual in the operations of nature. Kepler,
with aihew of plauAbility, has endeavoured to demonflrate, that God, in
the creation of the world, obferved the fame proportion in the magni­
tude and diftance of (the ccleftial fpheres that is found in the regular
folids which in geothetry have their origin from the ordinate planes ;
and therefore concludes, that the motions of the heavenly bodies cor­
refpond moll fweetly, and co-operate moil powerfully together, when
the nature of fublunary things, endued, as he fuppofes, with a fenfitivc
faculty, apprehends and receives the beams of the liars by their con­
currence at the centre of the earth ; which anfwers to the ordinate
planes, from whence the regularity of thefe proportions is derived, as
the impreifed characters of that admirable fymmetry which God is faid
to have obferved in the creation of the world. And hence he fuppofes
that, as often as anyearthly fubilance meets with thefe proportions, it is
affected as it were by this idea, and exercifed in fuch a manner, that
. what it but ordinarily performs at other times it will now produce
with much moreeffect. Not that thefe proportions work any thing of
themfelves j for, ip mufic, it is neither the founds, nor the proportion
of the concords, that work any thing of themfelves, or beget any de­
light in the hearerj but the foul, approaching tq ¿he organs of fenfe,
there fitft entertains the founds inwardly, then regards their proportions,
and, finding the fame good andgeometrical, lallly exhilarates itfelf, and
moves the body wherein it is as with an object wherein it takes delight.
Such |lfo is the fympathy between the heavenly influences and all fublu*
nary matter, animate, orinsuimatc.
No. 21. But,
416 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
Bat, be this conceit of Kepler’s as it may, we are not without fuffi-
cient geometrical demonftration, to ihew the reafon why thefe propor­
tions or irradiations of the ftars are more effe&ual than any others. For,
fince it is admitted that an union of beams affords the greateft influence,,
fo it is allowed that the conjunction and oppofition are, for this reafon,
the moft potent and powerful configurations of all others, as is ihewn
by the following figure, where we find the beams, as well incident as re-
fie&ed, to be united.
For, let A be fuppofed in conjun&ion with B, it is firft manifeft that
all the beams flowing from G and E, the points of touch in the circum*
ference of A , fhall unite themfelves with the betas that are fent from
B to C, the earth’s centre. Secondly, we are alfo to obferve, that in
this cafe the beams A C , or B C, coming from the centre of the ftars,
refledt only into itfelf, as being perpendicular ; whereas thole beams
which are fent from the points E and G make an acute angle at C, and
reflect the one into the other at equal angles j as G C reflect from C to
E, and E C from C to G . Laftly, the union that happens in an oppofi­
tion is manifeft without any illuftration, where the beams fent from the
oppofite points mako-but one ftrait line, as G F, and E H, in the
foregoing figure.
In
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 417
In like manner* in my contemplation* the configurations of the fex-
tile and trine have a concurrence of their beams at the earth, and a mu«
tual reflection of the one into the other* and fo an union by refie&ion* as
in the following figure is manifeA.
For* admit A B C to be three Aars, A and B in a Textile configuration,
and A C in a trine ; then, for fo much as B F, the beam incident of the
fextile, falls obliquely in refpect of A F, and makes an acute angle there­
with, it is evident, to any one who has the fmallefi underAanding in
optics, that B F fhall reflect to C, and fo be united to C F, the inci­
dent of the Aar C, which is in a trine configuration with A. For the
fame reafon, C F fhall reflect to the Aar in B, and be alfo united with B
F , the incident of the Aar at B. And hence arife the grounds of that
familiarity in thefe archs of heaven, which Ptolomy has laid down as the
moA apt for the apheta of life* or the houfes of the figure'. .
But the quartile afpect, whofe beams only cut each other ad angulos
reifos, and fo reflect into tbemfelves, derives its principal virtue from
the exact proportion of its angles in taking up the centre of the earth ;
and hence the tnyAery of thefe configurations wholly confifis in this, that
thefe irradiations only, and thofe that are derived from them, are pro­
portionable unto all patible matter, and therefore moA effectual. For
that thefe irradiations only are every way proportionable, has been al­
ready abundantly proved, whether we refpect their taking up thecircum-
ference, the power, and proportion, of their fubtenfes, untdfh'e diameter,
or, laAly and principally, their occupying of place at the centre of the
earth by their angles* whereby they muA needs fhinc upon all element iry
41« A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
matter with a due and even mixture of light and influence. And, fince
no other archs, fubtenfes, or angles, are found to enjoy thefe preroga­
tives, it is evident that thefe, above all others, have that fymmetry of
proportion which is neither defective, interrupted, nor redundant; but*
l'uch are the archs, fubtenfes, and angles, of thefe irradiations, that thefe,
and no other, are exactly proportionable. Now as that which is defedtive,
and wants equality of proportion, leaves the action fruftrate and with­
out effect; fo that, which on the other faaod offends in excefs, muft needs
incur the contrary fault, and overcharge that which either nature or art
intended to perform ; whereby it will neceifarily follow, that, wherever
there is no defect, nor excefs, but an equal and juft mixture of the in­
fluence of the ftars in thefe irradiations, thefe only can be apt and pro­
per to produce perfect and agreeable effects in the formation and tempe­
rature of all fublunary things. For it happens in thefe effects which are
produced by the mixture of light and heat, juft the fame as in chemi­
cal operations, where a defect of heat produces nothing ; while, on the
contrary, excefs will deftroy the whole, either by fublimation, vitrifica­
tion, eruption, or the like.
Having thus fatisfactorily {hewn how the points of the ordinate planes,
whereunto thefe configurations have been compared, often reiterated, do
take up place, 1 fhall now fet forth how the beams of any two ftar6 in
any one of the former configurations fhall occupy more fpace than that
which is comprehended between their incidents or beams of true motion;
and how by their beams, either incident, reflected, or oppofite, they
occupy and pofiefs the whole centre of the earth at one inftant with pro­
portionable angles. To demonftrate this, in refpect to the conjunction
and oppofition, whofe force rather depends upon union than proportion,
I need only refer the reader to a view of the laft diagram but one, where
he will find that the united beams of fuch ftars as are in conjunction and
oppofition furround the centre, and all elementary matter wbatfoever,
fubject to the actions of heaven. With regard to the quartile, whofe
beams incident and oppofite traverfe the centre of the earth at four right
angles, viz. at A F G , G F I, A F H, and H F I ; and feeing four
points of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been already proved to occu­
py place; I likewile need no otherproof, in this configuration, than that the
reader will in the laft figure obferve how thefe four right angles, made
by one quartile afpect, take up the centre of the earth. ' But, concerning
the trine and Textile afpects, we have yet more to confider; for, fuppofe
two ftars, A and B, in the laft diagram, irradiate The earth with theic
fextile beams ; although it be true, that, by protracting the oppofite
beam from B to F, the centre of the earth feems occupied with propor-
2 tionable
O P A S T R O L O G Y . 4
*9
ti&nabte angles, B F A being fubtelftded by the ark of fixty 'degree*,
which is before declared to be the angle of an ordinate equilateral trian­
gle, and fo leaves the outward angle B F I equal to the angle of an ordi-
«Rate hexagon, fubtended here by the ark of one hundred and twenty de­
grees, which is the ark of a trine j and the like being alfo found in the
angles made by the oppolite beams ad vertiam j yet, neverthelefs, we
muft here confider how the incident beam of B, viz. B F, reflects into
C, and fo takes up the whole femicircle A B C I with three Textiles, viz.
A F B, B F C, and C F I. In like manner, if we fuppofe C to be in
a triangular configuration with A, it is evident that as the oppofite beatn
of A, viz. F I, makes a Textile with the incident beam of a ftar at C, viz.
C F ; fo C F, being the beam incident of the ftar at C, reflects alfo to
the point B, and fo makes the fame three Textile afpeds wherewith the
aforefaid whole femicircle is occupied, as above demonftrated. Thefe
cohfiderations will undoubtedly fatisfy the reader how any two ftars, in
either of the afpeds above alluded to, proportionably occupy the whole
centre of the earth in the fame moment of time, without reiterating the
fame angle.
I have hitherto only fpoken of what are termed the old configurations,
which are indifputably the moil excellent; but I lhall now mention
what are called the new ones, as introduced by the ingenious Kepler,
namely, the quintile confifting of feventy-two degrees ; the biquintile,
of one hundred and forty-four degrees ; and thcjefquiquadrate, of one
hundred and thirty-five degrees j which afpeds, being added to the for­
mer, make eight configurations, anfwering to the eight confonant flops
in a monochord. Thefe new additions are by no means improperly made,
fincemany eminent praditioners of this fcience have experienced their uti­
lity in fpeculations on the weather and meteors; as well as in bringing
up the accidents of a nativity. Neither is there any want of philofophi-
cal or mathematical demonftrations to fupport them; for as in mufic
there are but three perfed concords, namely, the diapafon, diapente,
and diateftaron ; fo in aftrology there are but three perfed afpeds anfwera-
ble to them, viz. the oppofition, the trine, and the quartile j the Textile
having already been proved an imperfed afpect, anfwering exactly to B
fiat, the firft among the imperfect and compounded concords. Where­
fore, confidering that the firft three perfect concords are found to have
their perfect afpects anfwerable unto them, and that B fiat, being an im-
J
jerfect concord, is alfo found to agree exactly in proportion with the
extile, being an imperfect afpect, this undoubtedly gave Kepler fuffici-
ent reafon to conceive that the other harmonical proportions contained in
the fame monochord might alfo have their afpects, namely, the quin­
N o. fii. 5 1 tile,
420 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
tile, biquintile, and fefquiquadrate, which are precifeJy found to cor-
refpond with them, and are in a fimilar degree effectual in their mode of
operation.
Thus having explained what the afpects or configurations of the pla­
nets really are, and proved that their power and influences are grounded
upon philofophical and mathematical principles, I (hall now proceed to
{hew their applications in the iffues of human life, from the conception
to the grave.
l\ is, l believe, univerfally admitted, that the beginning of human
generation takes place at the time of conception ; and therefore we ought
to be exact in afcertaining this time, and in confidering the effective
power of the configurations of the itars, as they then happen to be pofited,
and from thence contemplate the qualities of the mind and body. For
in the beginning, although the feed at once affumes a quality by the
communication of the circumambient matter, which at other times of
its formation and inercafe becomes different ; yet naturally, as it in-
creafes, it retains its own proper matter, and is rendered more like the
peculiar nature of the firft quality, with which it was imp relied at the
time of conception. But, if it be of fome importance to know the time
of conception, it is infinitely more fo to know the true time of birth ;
for by the firft, the accidents only before birth are known ; but by the
fecond, thofe incident to our whole lives are to be difeovered. Where­
fore one may be called a beginning, and the other an after-beginning;
the fixft* the generation of human feed ; the fecond, that of man. For
in this ftate the infant aifumes many things which it had not when in the
womb, and thele peculiar to human nature alone, and the formation of
the body. And although the properties of the celeftial and elemen­
tary matter feems to confer nothing at the time of birth in rcfpect to the
formation of the child, yet it operates moil forcibly upon it in other re-
fpecti ; for nature, after perfecting the formation, difpofes the enluing
effect according to the ftate of the former at the beginning. Hence it
is reasonable, in thofe whofe time of conception is unknown, that the
configurations of the ftafs formed at their birth, ihould be fignificative ;
not that it wholly contains an effective power, but becaufe it neceifarily
hath a power by nature fimilar to the effective. But it is always beft, if
the time of conception can be had, to compare it with the time of birth ;
for the time of conception (hews what (hall happen to the infant while in
the womb; as whetherit (hall be ilrong or weak, firm or infirm, perfect or
imperfect, male or female, finglc or twins ; or whether it ihall arrive to
the full and perfect time of birth. But the occurrences of life after birth
are to betonlidered from the pofition of the heavens at the birth only.
2 Now
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 4ai
Now, fince nothing can be predi&ed in aftrology without this funda­
mental guide, namely, the radix, or true time of birth, various me­
thods have been invented, indifferent ages, for thepurpofe of afcertain-
ing this point with precifion, after the eftimate or fuppofed time is
given. And this is termed the replication of nativities, becaufe the
time ufually noted down by parents or midwives is feldotn corre£t, either
through inattention, or errors in clocks; but, by thefe rules, the diffe­
rence between the eftimate or fuppofed time, and the real, is difcovered
and corredted. This re&ification is done by various ways; firft, by
theTrutineof Hermes; fecondly, by the Animoder of Ptolomy ; and,
thirdly, by accidents of the native’s life, which are alfo fivefold ; firft,
according to Argol ; fecondly, according to Kepler; thirdly, according
to Morinus; fourthly, by the luminaries; and fifthly, by a new and
more corretl method. •
By the Trutineof Hermes, ereft the figure to the eftimate time of
biith, and reftify the Moon’s place thereto; then take her diftance from
the afcendant, if fhe be under the earth ; or from the feventh houfe, if
above the earth, by fubtrabling the angles from the Moon’s place;
adding thereto the three hundred and fixty degrees of the zodiac, if fub-
trattion cannot be made without: then with the remainder enter the fol­
lowing table under the column of Moon’s diftance, and even with it, in the
fecond column, if the birth was in February ; in the third column, if in
January or December ; in the fourth column, if in April or September;
or in the fifth column, if in March, May, June, July, Auguft, October,
or November; will be found an equation of days to be added to, or fub-
traffed from, the day of birth, according to the letters A or S, at the
top of each refpeftivc column, whofelum or difference gives the day of
the month in the month of conception ; always obferving, that, if the
year of birth be a leap-year, one day more muft be added«

If the birth was in January, the month of conception was A p ril; if
February, the month of conception was M ay; if March, June ; if
April, July j if May, Auguft; if June, September ; if July, O&ober j
if Auguft, November ; if September, December; if O&ober, January ;
if November,«February ; and, if December, March. Then bring the
Moon’s place, the day of conception, to the fign, degree, and minute,
afcending, at the eftimate time, for the true time of conception. O r
th u s: fubtradt the right afceniion o f the Sun at the eftimate time o f con­
ception, from the right afceniion at the eftimate time of birth, (taken in
the Table of Houfes right againft the Moon’s place, under the afcendant,
adding the three hundred and fixty degrees or the zodiac, as before, if
fubtraftion cannot otherwife be made;) the remainder, converted into
time, is the true hour and minute o f conception. The degree and mi­
nute of the iign in which the Moon was podted at conception is the
true degree and minute afcending at birth, according to the Trutine of
Hermes.

To rcftify by the Animoder of Ptolomy, ereft the figure as near a*
poflible to the eftimate time of birth9 and confider in what fign, and in
what degree of that fign9 the new Moon happened that laft preceded the
birth ; or, if a full Moon more nearly preceded the time of birth than a
new, then nofe the degree of the fign wherein either of the luminaries
were pofited that were above the earth; but, if one of the luminaries be
exa&Iy rifing, and the other fetting, prefer that which is rifing. Then
obferve which of the planets hath moil dignities by triplicity, houfe, ex­
altation, term, or configuration, in the degree of fuch preceding new
Moon, or in the degree of the luminary above the earth, or that afcends
at fuch preceding full M oon; and alfo what fign and degree then afcerid
upon the horizon, or that culminate or poflcfs the cufp of the tenth
houfe; and if the degree of the planet, dignified as above, be lituated
nearer the degree afcending than to the degree culminating, place the
fame degree in number of the fign afcfcnding upon the cufp of the
afcendant that fuch ruling planet poffefTed of the fign he was in. But,
on the contrary, if the planet be nearer the degree on the cufp of the
tenth houfe or medium cceli than to the afcendant, then the degree
culminating, or poffeffing the cufp of the midheaven, muft be made
the fame with the degree the faid planet was in ; and fo, according to
the fign and degree thus ascertained, muft the other houfes of the
figure be varied ; a*nd this will be the true time of the native’s birth.
But, if it fhould happen that ttfo planets have equal digpitie^in-the
degrees aforefaid, prefer that which is pofited the neareftjtc/the afcen­
dant. Ptolomy further obferves, that what fign the Moon is in at the
time of birth is the very fign which afeended at the conception ; and
again, whatever fign the Moon ¡9 in at conception, that, or the oppofite,
will be the fign afcending at birth.
•
To re&ify by accidents, according to the method of Argol, fet the
fcheme exadly to the eftimate time, and draw it into a fjftculum; then
run down the columns in the fpeculum belonging to the afcendant and
medium cceli, conlidering what dire&ions might moil probably fignify
the accidents given, obferving the afcendant for accidents befalling the
body } the medium cceli for things relating to credit or reputation, as
trade, honour, diflionour, preferment, &c. and convert the time of the
accident into an arch of direction, by Naibod’s meafure of time; and then,
finding the true, right, or oblique, afeenfion of the promiflor with lati­
tude, if he hath any, from which fubtrading the arch of direction, the
remainder will be the right afeenfion of the medium cceli, or oblique
afeenfion of the afcendant. If it be the oblique afeenfion of the afeen
dant, fubtract ninety degrees from it, the remainder will be the righ

afcenfion of the medium cceli corrected, between which and the right
afcenfion of the medium cceli of the fuppofed time take the difference ^
which add or fubtract to or from the fuppofed time, according as the right
afcenfion of the medium cceli did increafe or decreafe, and the fum or
difference is the true time of birth required.
Secondly, according to Kepler, gather a table of the Sun’s place for
eighty, ninety, or one hundred, days, more or lefs, immediately lucceed-
itig the day of birth ; then, having the time of the accident, number fo
many days of the Sun’s motion as there were years elapfed from the
bfrth, making proportion for the odd days, and find the Sun’s place at
that time, with the right afcenfion thereof, which fubtract from the
oblique afcenfion of the promiifor denoting the accident, added to two
hundred and feventy degrees, the remainder is the right afcenfion of time
corrected; where note, that, having fet the figure to the eftimate time,
calculate the Sun’s place thereto, and find the difference between that
and his place at noon the day of birth; which, if it exceeds his place of
birth, fubtract the aforefaid difference from his place at noon, agreeing
with that day fignifying the number of years in which the accident
happened ; but, if it be lefs, add ; fo ihall the difference or fum be the
Sun’s direction for years complete ; then, for the odd days of the acci­
dent, if any be, find the Sun’s diurnal motion, in the find collection,
againft. the ¿lay fignifying the faid number of years, and fay, as three
hundred arfa §xty-five days fix hours are to the Sun’s diurnal motion,
fo are the laid odd days to the odd minutes, which are to be added to the
Sun’s direction aforefaid, which fum is the Sun’s true place at the time
of birth. But, to rectify it by an accident compared with the medium
cceli, fubtract the right afcenfion of the Sun, found by the former rule
for the year and day of |he accident, from the right afcenfion of the pro­
miflor, (by adding three hundred and fixty degrees, if fubtraction cannot
be made without,) and the remainder is the right afcenfion of time cor­
rected.
Thirdly, according to Morinus, to rectify the afeendant or medium
cceli by a direction to the conjunction or oppofition of the promifTor of
any accident is exactly the^faine with A rgo l; but, if it be to the Textile,
quartile, or trine, of any fuch promiifor, firft find their latitude, and
then in all refpects follow the fame method as is above given in the di­
rections of Argol.
T o rectify by the luminaries, proceed as follows : I f no direction of
either angles will anfwer to the accident given, and it be eminent,
conlider
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 425
confider the pofition of the luminaries, and fee what diredlion of either
of them might moil probably fignify the fame; which done, find the
luminaries pole of pofition exacily for its place in the efiimate figure,
under which pole diredt the faid luminary to the faid probable promiiTor,
and find the difference between that and the time of the accident convert­
ed into an arch of diredlion ; then make a fecond fuppofition, at the
pole of polition, working as before; and, noting the difference betweea
the arches of the two dircdlions, f-y, as the difference of thele two arches
is to the difference in the poles of pofition, lb is the firft aforefaid dif­
ference to the difference between the firil fuppofed pole of pofition
and the true pole of the luminary propofed ; but it is neccflury fiere,
that tlie eftimate time he given pretty exad. Thus, having found the
true pole or polition, it gives the tiue oblique afeention or delccnfion o f
the luminaries, with its difLnce from the meridian ; by which may be
found the medium cceli correct, and thereby the true time of birth.
Befides thefe, there are f vcral new methods o f redifying nativities
by accidents. For inftjnce, let the figure to the efiimate time, and
draw a fpeculum thereto; in which, helides the alpeds of the planets,
infert alfo the afpeds which the afeendant and medium caeli make with
every fign ; this done, confider wh.it promiffors occur to a conjunction,
Textile, quartile, trine, or oppofition, of the afeendant or medium cccli,
and for every year account one day in the Ephcmcris to the year current
in which the accident happened, find that promiffor’s place (in that
day adhering to the year current) for the eftimate time of birth ;
faying, rs twenty-four hours is to the planet’s diurnal motion, fo are
the hours and minutes elapfed from noon to the minutes to be added or
fubtraned to or from the planet’s place at noon that day according as
the faid planet was either direti or retrograde; then, lailly, as three hun­
dred and fixty five days fix hours are to that promilfor’s diurnal motion,
fo is the number of days elapfed from the birth (at the termination of
which the accident fell out) to the minutes to be again added or fub-
tradted to or from the aforefaid place of the faid promiiTor, as he was
dirtdi or retrograde; to which very degree and minute the afeendant or
medium cceli muff be brought. But, if there be no diredlion of the
afeendant or medium cceli to fignify that accident, confider what other
fignificator, being diretted to any likely promiiTor, might effedt the
lame; and, in the Ephemeris, againil that day fignifying the number of
the years current, for the eftimate time of birth find the place of the laid
promiiTor; then lay, as three hundred and fixty-five dajs fix hours arc
to twenty-four hours, fo are the days elapfed (in which the accident
happened from the birth-day) to their proportioned part: fecondly, as
• twenty-four
426 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
twenty-four hours are to th$ fignificator's diurnal motion, fo is the afore-
£nd proportional part to the minutes and feconds, which are to be fub-
dufled out of the place of the aforefaid promiflor ; and the remainder is
the exa^i place of the iaid fignificator at the true time of birth. In this
cafe it will be nrqeflary to have the eftimate time very near, and that
the Sun, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon, be fignificators; and Saturn,
Jupiter, or Mars, or their afpefts, protniflbrs; otherwife, if the more
weighty planets be fignificators, take the diurnal motion of the promiflor
and work as before; fubducling thefe minutes and fcconds from the
figbificator, and the remainder is the exa& place of the promiflor at the
true'time of birth. If yet nodireiftion appears, which may fignify the
given accident, confiderthe Moon’s diredions on the right-hand page of
the Ephemeris, againft the day fignifying the year current in which the
accident happened ; and, allowing two hours for a month, fubtrad the
davs elapled from the birth-day from the hours and minutes, adhering
to the lunar afpect, and the remainder will be the hour and minute of
birth corrected. The fame obfervation likewife holds good with refpect
to the mutual afpects.
But the ihorteft, eafieft, and moft Ample, way of rectifying a nativity,
and which includes all the perfections of the foregoing, provided the
eftimate time does r/t exceed two hours of the real, is as follows.
Havingere&ed the Satire to the eftimate time, obferve whether either of the
luminaries be pofiyid in the centre of any one of the three prime angles,
namely, the afee'idant, medium ceeli, or feventh houfc, or near them;
and, if fo, bring either of them to the cufp of the angle, and the
degree and iW.nute they were in is the true time of birth. But, if
neither of th'/e are found thus centrically pofited, nor near the cufps of
either of tliofe angles, then bring them to a right parallel from angles,
and that will be the true time. If their poiitions will not admit of
this, obferve the two benefic planets Jupiter and Venus, and note
whether either of them arc fituated as above fpecificd, namely, in the
centre of the angles, or in a right parallel with either of the luminaries,
that is to fay, with the Sun by day, or the Moon by night; and cither
of thefe brought to the cufps as before, will give the true time of
birth. So likewife either ef the malefic planets Saturn and Mars, if
found pofited in the centre of the angles, or near their cufps, or in
parallel to either of the luminaries as above, will be the prorogator of
life, and likewife ihew the true time of birth; but thefe laft pofitions
arc rarely if ever found in the fchemes of grown perfon’s nativities,
becaufe their influences, if not corrected by the rays of benevolent
3 iters,
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 427
Bars, are of fo deflru&ive a tendency, that they generally cut off life
in a lhort time, either in infancy, or at -lead in the firit ilage of life.
Now, having brought a nativity from its eltimative or fuppofed time
to that of the real, we are next to confider its proper and contingent
parts and lignifications, fo far as they relate to accidents before birth, and
to thofe after the fubjedt comes into the world; as alfo to parents,
brethren, and relations, of the native. The particular confiderations
before birth relate to fex, as whether the infant be male or f e m a l e '
and likewife to number, as whether there be twins or not. The caufes”
of deformity, of monfters, and of thofe which periih in the womb for
want of nourishment, are alfo included in this part of the dodtrine of
nativities. But the particular fubje&s of enquiry after birth relate to
the length of life and form of the bodyj to bodily difeafes, and
accidental hurts and blemishes of the members ; to the faculties of the
mind and mental affe&ions. They likewife include the future fortune
of the native, as well in poiTeilions as in dignities; and alfo in the
quality of his adtions. Then concerning marriage and procreation ; the
harmony of friends, and animoiity of enemies; next of travellingj
and, laftly, of death.— But the consideration concerning death is natu­
rally joined to that which relates to the fpace of life. Since it Shews the
quality and mode of its termination.
It may naturally be aiked, how thefe events are feverally and refpec-
tively distinguished ? To explain this, let it be always remembered, that,
for any particular event, we are to refer to fuch peculiar place in the
zodiac as is proper to that fpecies of action in the geniture concern­
ing which we are about to enquire. And, whatever liar is found to
have dominion in fuch place, either by triplicity, houfe, exaltation,
term, or configuration, fuch Bar Shall have dominion of the event. . But,
if two or more liars Shall be found in thefe feveral portions, then that
Bar which has familiarity by moll ways, namely, that has the majority
of dignities, Shall be taken as ruler of the event, and Shall alfume the
dominion accordingly. The quality of the event is always known from
the nature of thefe ruling liars, added to that of the figns in which thofe.
Stars are pofited, and the familiarities they have with the other Signifi­
cant parts of the heavens. The extent and importance of the event is
known from the lordlhips and dominions of thefe ruling liars, according
to their Strength or weaknefs in refpect of their afpects in the world and
the geniture. They are Strong in refpect of the world, when they are
in propef places, or oriental, or augmented j and in refpect of the ge­
niture, when they make their tranfits on the angles, or fuccedent houfes j
No. 21. 5 L but
428 A N I L L U S T * R A T I O N
but particularly when they occupy the cufps of the afeendant or mid­
heaven. And they are deemed weak in refpect of the world, when they
are in occidental places, and flow, retrograde, and diminiihing their
courfcs ; but weak in refpect of the geniture, when they are in cadent
houfes, or falling from the angles. The general time of the event is
known from thefe ruling ftars being orientally or occidcntally pofited in
refpect of the Sun and the horofeope, and from their being in the angles
or fuccedent houfes $ for, when they are matutine or angular, they are
quick $ but, when occidental or vefpertine, flow.
•Thefe things being premifed, it follows that the firft confideration upon
the face of a geniture is that which relates to the parents of the native.
The Sun, therefore, and Saturn, reprefent the perfon of the father; and
the Moon and Venus that of the motherj and, as thefe are found
afflicted among themlelves, or otherwife, fo we underftand the accidents
appertaining to parents will be. The ftars that are configurated with
the luminaries ihew what relates to their fortunes and poffeflions $ for, if
they are furrounded by the benefics, and by fuch as are of the fame
nature, and in the fame figns, or the fucceeding, their fortunes will be
illuftrious and fplendid ; particularly if the Sun be configurated with
oriental ftars, or the Moon by occidental. If Saturn and Venus be ori­
entally pofited, or angular, they foreihew happinefs according to the par­
ticular circumftances of each parent. If the luminaries are void o f courfe,
and in no good afpect with the fortunate ftars, a low condition, or an
ignoble life, is prenoted : but, if the luminaries arc varioufly configu­
rated with good and evil ftars, a mediocrity and inequality in the fortunes
of the parents is thereby demonftrated; as when Mars afeends to the
Sun, or Saturn to the Moon, and the benefics in different conditions.
Again, if the part of fortune in the nativity is found in a good pofition,
with the ftars configurated with the Sun and Moon, the affairs of the
parents will be profperous; but, if it be difeordant, and fituaied in a bad
place of the figure, with malefic ftars, their concerns will turn out inju­
rious and unprofitable.
The length and (hortnefs of life muft be confidered from other confi­
gurations. If Jupiter or Venus arc any way joined in afpcct with the Sun
or Saturn, or if Saturn hath an harmonizing configuration with the Sun,
that is, if they behold each other by a Textile or trine, and ftrongly dig­
nified in other refpects, they promife lonjj_ life to the father. But if
thefe pofitions are found weak, wirg Mars dignified above the Sun, and
Saturn in quartile or oppolition, the father will be taken off in the early
part of his life. The diftinctione which relate to the mother are thefe.
2 If
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 429
I f Jupiter is configurated to the Moon or Venus, or Venus alone tjeholds
the Moon by a fextile or trine afpeft, the mother.will fifljoy-health and
long&uty; but, if Mars be pofited in any of the angular or fucceedent
houfes, beholding the Moon or Venus with a quartile or oppofition; or
if Saturn is thus configurated with the Moon, flow in motion, and de­
clining from angles ; they induce the diredt contrary effedts, and pro­
claim a difeafed and Ihort life to the mother. Thus from the nativity of
a child may the principal concerns of the father and mother be fought
out, and alcertained $ and fuch is the fympathy exifting by this bond o f
nature and confanguinity, that little difference will be found, if com*
pared with the proper nativity of each parent. ,
But, to give judgment in fuch cafes with correftnefs, feparate fchemes
inuft be erected for the father and mother, by the following rule. In
the figure erefled for the father, if the nativity be diurnal, note the :
degree in which the Sun is pofited in the child’s nativity, and make that
the degree afcending upon the horofcope for the father; and conforma­
ble to that order the cufps of all the other houfes, by the rules hereto­
fore laid down. I f the figure be eredted for the mother, then take the
degree of Venus, inltead of the Sun, and proceed in all other refpedts
the fame. But, if the nativity be noftumal, take the degree of Saturn for
the father, and that of the Moon for the mother. And in all thefe cafes
it muft be obferved, that the nativity of the firft-born is to be pre­
ferred, then that of the fecond, and fo on. And that whatever is pre­
noted in relation to the parents from thefe figures, is only fuch as (hall
happen to them after the birth of the child, and not to any thing before.
The time in which any or each of thefe events will happen, is to be
fought out by the archs of direction, or diftances of that liar which hath
the dominion in refpedt of the Sun and the angles of the world $ and
this I ihall make perfedtly eafy to the meaneft underftanding, when I
come to treat of directions in general.
Now the next confideration in the native’s geniture is the place o f
brethren, and this is taken from the fign on the mid-heaven, and the
maternal place, which is the pofition of Venus by day, and the Moon by
n igh t; for, as this can only relate to children born of the fame mother,
this fign, and that which fucceeds it, being maternal, naturally confti-
tutes the place of brethren. This place, therefore, being configurated by
benevolent liars’, denotes plenty of brethren, becaufetheincreafe of bro­
thers and filters happens according to the multitude of liars, and from
their being lituated in double-bodied figns, or in thofe of one form.—
But, if the malefics have fuperiority in number or power, or are adveife
by
43°
■* #
AN I L L U S T R A T I O N
by oppofition, paucity of brethren will happen, particularly if unbe­
nign ftars circumfcribe the Sun.' If the contrariety of afpects be in an­
gular houfes, efpecially in the afcendant, Saturn will procure thofe that
are firft. nouriihed, and firil born; and Mars will induce to fewnefs and
death. Moreover, if the ftars which give brethren arc well-affected ac­
cording to mundane lituations, the general fortunes of the brethren will
be glorious and famous; but mean and obfcure if the contrary portions
happen. If the malefics be fuperior in number and ftrength to the
ftars which give brethren, their conftitutions will be puny, and their
lives (hort.
And here alfo we may obferve, that from the geniture of one brother
the principal incidents of the life of another may be dil'covered, by con-
ftituting the place of the given planet as an horofcope, that is, the planet
which has principal rule in the houfe of brethren, whether by day or
night. The method is to place this ruling planet, with the fame de­
gree he is found in, upon the afcendant, furnilhing the cufps of all the
other houfes by this ftandard, as before ftated in the cafe of parents. It
muft howevec always be remembered, that mafculine ftars produce
males, and feminine females. Alfo if the ftars which denote brethren, and
that which has rule in the houfe of brethren, agree by any harmonious
configuration, they will be well-affected towards each other, and live in
friendihip and concord; but, if thefe ftars are found in contrary pofi-
tions, and in figns inconjunct, enmity and hate will mark their conduct
towards each other.
The foregoing fpeculations are deduced from an inveftigation of the
pofition of the heavens at the time of birth; but, in order to know whe­
ther the infant be male or female, during the ftate of pregnancy, the
time of conception only muft be confidered. For this purpole, we muft
particularly obferve the pofition of both the luminaries in refpect to the
horofcope at the time of conception, together with the lituations of
all the ftars which have a regard to them; and whether the ruling ftars
are conftituted of a mafculine or feminine nature. For the production of
males and females is according to the diftinction of mafculine and fe­
minine ftars, which I have already Ihewn proceeds from the nature of
the figns in which they are polited, and from their mutual and mundane
refpect; for, being oriental, they are mafculine; but, occidental, femi­
nine. The fame likewife in refpect to the Sun; for, being oriental, they
are referred to the male; and, occidental, to the female. Therefore thofe
which have the greateft powerin thefe refpects at the time of conception
will give fufficient grounds to c
o

je

eat the fez of the infant for
months before it is born.
S
o
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 431
So liltewife the fame confederations hold good, io fome sefpeSs, con-
Oerniog twins, or more ; for herein we ere principally to regard the two
luminaries, and the afcendant. For it happens through the mixtures
which are occafioned when thefe poffefs bicorporal iigns, or when the
ruling planets are fituated in them, and many prolific ftars caft their rays
to the fame, that it w ill be a plural conception. The number then
generated is known from the ftar which induces the propriety o f the
number; but the fex is determined by the ftars configurated with the
Sun, Moon, and horoscope. For we find from obfervation, that, when
both the luminaries are in the mid-heaveo, twins are procreated; when
Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, have configuration with the aifigned places
in bicorporal figns, three males'are generated; but three females, when
Venus, Luna, and Mercury, are configurated in the fame manner. Saturn,
Jupiter, and Venus, thus difpofed, produce two males and one female; but
Venus, Luna, and Mars, two females and one male. Thefe configu­
rations but rarely happening at the time of conception, render it a kind
o f phenomenon whenever they occur ; and hence we generally find the
births that follow in confequence are ranked amongft the wonders of
the day in the public prints, though the caufe has a radical foundation
in nature. And hence too it is, that, as thefe configurations are more or
lefs imperfeftly made, fo will be the quality o f the conception, either
bringing all into life uniform and perfe& at the birth, or elfe bringing
one with good conformation, and another with puny, imperfect, or tnon-
ftrous, members. '
There are alfo certain configurations of the ftars, which abfolutely pro­
duce moles or monfters in every conception that takes place under
them. Thus it happens when the luminaries decline from angles, and
fall cadent, without any kind o f afpeft to the afcendant, and when the
cardinal houfes are occupied by the malefic planets. But, to deferibe
the fpecies of unnatural birth, it is neceftary, in thefe configurations, to
obferve the place o f the laft full Moon preceding the time o f conception,
together with the ruler thereof, and the lord of the luminaries; for, if
the placesof thefe fignificators have no familiarity with the place o f the
faid preceding full M oon, what is then generated will be of unnatural
conformation. I f the luminaries are at the fame time pofited in four­
footed figns, and the two malefic planets in angular houfes, what Is
then conceived w ill not be in human lhape; but, if Jupiter or Venus in-
terpofe their benevolent rays, and give teftimony to the luminaries, then
what is conceived will be of human conformation, but of a fierce and
favage nature. I f Mercnry correfponds with the luminaries, the dif-
pofition w ill be agreeable to nature, but the form of the body will be
N o. 22, 5 M unnatural;
432 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N
unnatural* or, if the luminaries be in human figns, and the ruling planet
difcordant, then the offspring will be of proper conform ation, but mon-
ftrous in quality. I f one of the malefic ftars give teftimony in any o f
the foregoing pofitions, what is then generated will be irrational, or o f
ungovernable qualities; but, if Jupiter Or Venus give teftimony, the
offspring w ill naturally poflefs the mental accompliihments, with an her-
inaphroditical conformation. If Mercury alone gives teftimony to the
aforefaid pofitions of the luminaries, that which is procreated will be
deaf, and perhaps dumb, though intellectually well qualified, and in-
genjous. Thefe fpeculations are doubtlcfs abftrufe, becaufe fuch con­
figurations feldom happen, and the refult of them is very little known ;
but, to confirm their effedt, I have only to recommend to thofe who
have their doubts, to be guided by obfervation, and to decide by the re-
fu lt, for, the more we enquire into the pathlefs ways of nature, the more
readily we deduce a radical caufefor all her produdtions.
But here I muft not omit to remark, that the time of conception, and
that only, is to be referred to for the conformation or accidents of the
child in the womb ; and the time of birth for what (hall happen after;
notwithftanding there is always fuch a concurring agreement between
the conception and birth, that whatever is produced by the former is
in a great meafure to be difeovered from the latter, though not wholly
correct, or to be relied upon as infallible. Thofe therefore, who are
born in their natural ihape, and afterward become crippled and lame,
even to a monftrofity, yet, fince not brought into the world with the na­
tive, they fall under the defeription of blemifhes, or bodily infirmities,
rather than the relult of monftrous and unnatural conformations.
D iftind from this fpecies of conception, is that which, though per*
fe&ly natural and well conformed, yet is void of ftamina, and hence
termed an embryo not nourifhed. This.kind of conception happens when
one of the luminaries, in an angular pofition, is joined with a malefic
liar, and that luminary giver of life. So likewife, if the parallel of
longitude between the malefic planet and the luminary be partile, or
according to a figure of equal fades, and none of the fortunes correfpond-
ing, and at the fame time the lord of the luminaries be pofited in a dif­
cordant place, what is then generated cannot be nouriihed, but decays
in the womb, or expires foon after the birth. Or, if they are not equi­
laterally configurated, but the two malefic planets nearly irradiate the
places of the luminaries, afflicting both, oroitty one of them» no matter
whether the malefics be fuccedent or oppofite, fo one or both of them be
in partile configuration with the luminaries; for whatever is born under
3 fuch
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 433
fuch influences will be of no duration, fince the greatnefs- o f the power
o f the malefics will deftroy what ihould neccffarily conduce to the nou-
riihment of life.
It is particularly to be obferved, that Mars affii&s the Sun by fuc-
ceflions, and Saturn the Moon ; but by oppofitions the contrary hap­
pens ; for in thefe the Sun is afflified by Sat urn, and the Moon by M ars;
and this affliction is the more eminent when the malefic ftars are fignifi-
cators, and by that means become fuperior both to the luminaries and
the horofcope, From thefe obfervations, fubordinate effects have been
afeertained; for, when there are two oppofition$>,of the malefic ftars, and
the luminaries fituated in angles, whatever follows that conception w ill
be ftill-born. But if at this time the luminaries are feparating from the
benefic planets, or are in any other afpect with them, cafting their
beams at that time in a converfe direflion, the foetus will obtain anima­
tion, and be found alive and perfect at the birth; but will live only fo
many months, days, or hours, as there are degrees, minutes, or feconds,
of the folar motion, between the beams of the Aphcta and the neareft
malefic planet. But if the malefics caft their beams to the parts preced­
ing the luminaries, and the benefics to the degrees following, what is
born will fuffer great afflictions, and ftruggle much with infirmities, but
(hall recover and live.
\
And hence the confideration that naturally follows regards the dura­
tion or fpacc of life, which, taking in the whole compafs of human pur-
fuits, and the duration and viciffitudes of them, doubtlefs becomes the
moll intcreiling part of the doctrine o f the ftars. The mode of afeer-
taining this important point, namely, the fpace or duration of the na­
tive’s life, is defined from a comparifon of the aphetic, hylegiacal, or
prorogatory, places, with the killing oranaretical places inthegenethliacal
figure, at the time of birth. The aphetic place is the fituation of the
Apheta, Hyleg, Prorogator, Significator, or giver of life, for they have
all the fame meaning; and, the anaretic place is the fituation o f the
Anareta, or killing planet; and, whenever thefe ihall meet together, or
be conjoined in a bodily afpect, the native will find a termination of life ;
confequently the length of time, in which the Apheta and Anareta,
as pofited in each refpective figure of a nativity, will be in forming a
conjunction, or coming together in the fame point of the heavens, is the
precife length of the native’s life ; and this period is alcertained by what
we'teTtn atches o f diretiion, equated by the folar motion, and reduced
to common time. The method of afeeriaining theft?' aphetical and
anaretical places, of finding the arches o f direction, and of reducing
them

tropic give* the native an excellent complexion, comely, of a g«od
ftature, abounding with heat and tnoifture. But the quadrant from the
Summer tropic to the autumnal equinox gives but an indifferent com«
plexion, Slough the body is well proportioned, healthy, and vigorous,
abounding with heat and drinefs. That from the autnmnal equinox to
the winter tropic gives a (anguine complexion, with a (lender, lean,
and fickly, habit, abounding with drinefs and cold. The quadrant from
the winter folftice to the fpring equinox gives a dark complexion, with
a moderate ftature, fquare and ftrong, abounding with cold and moif-
ture. This is to be underftood in reference to the figns afeending, aqd
in which the Moon and other fignificators refpe&ively bear rule. But
it is more particularly to be obferved, that the figns which are of hu­
man form, both in the zodiac and without it, make bodies of a moil
excellent fymmetry and propottionj while thofe which are not of hu­
man form ad contrariwife, deranging the proper rules of proportion,
and influencing from the properties effential to an elegant fhape to that
of difproportion and deformity.
O f the radical Caufe of B L E M I S H E S and B O D I L Y
D I S E A S E S .
From a Similar hypothefis to the above, we derive the obfervation of
external blemifhes and bodily difeafes, with all the common accidents
o f the human frame, to which the native is expofed during the courfe qf
his life. The moft approved mode of afeertaining and diftinguifhing
thefe is by regarding the eaftern and weftern angles of the horizon, but
particularly the weftern, and the part preceding, which is the fixth
houfe, for that is inconjund with the oriental angle. Thefe angles
being properly taken, we fhould next obferve the malefic ftars, and how
they are configurated ; for, if both or either of them are pofited upon the
afeending parts of the faid angles, either bodily or by quartile or oppo-
fition, there will be external blemifhes, or bodily infirmities, inse­
parable from the perfon then born. Or, if both the luminaries, or only
one of them, be angular, as above deferibed, either in conjundion or
oppofition, with a malefic ftar afeending, they will produce fuch infir­
mities or blemifhes as the particular places of the horizon and figns then
afeending, and as•the nature of the malefic and ill-affefted ftars, (hall
refpedively manifeftj for in this cafe, as in all (itnilar ones, the degrees
of the figns which are upon the afHided part of the horizon will thew
the particular part of the body wherein the infirmity is, whether it be a
blemifh or difeafe, or both; and the nature of thofe ftars w ill likewife
point out the caufe and quality of the fymptom,

0 Blemifhes and bodily hurts for the mod part happen when the male*
lies are oriental; but difeafes when occidental« And, as their caufe is
different, fo alio is their eflFcdt 5 for hurt or blemiih fuffers pain only
once* and is not prolonged; but a difeafe frequently com es^y fits, or
continually affefts the patient, inducing a long and lingering diflolu-
tion, or confumptive habit. Thefe are general confiderations; but the
more particular do&rine o f blemifhes and difeafes hath another fpecu-
lation of figures, by which, for the moil part, fimilar accidents follow.
For blindnefs of one eye is indicated, when the Moon is poiited in cither
at the aforementioned angles by herfelf, or at the precife time of be­
coming new or full; or when fhe is configurated in a quartile afpedt,
and applies to any of the nebulous conventions in the zodiac. The fame
misioitune happens when Saturn or Mars, being oriental, afeend to the
Moon, pofited in an angle; but, whenever they are thus configurated to
both the luminaries, either in the fame fign or in the oppofite, and
orientally pofited in refpedlof the Sun, but occidental in reipedt of the
Moon, they caufe blindnefs in both the eyes. Mars ufually denotes
blindnefs by the effedts of a blow or thruft, and by lightning, burning,
& c. but, if configurated with Venus, it generally proceeds from an ac­
cident in play or exercife, or from the fudden attack of aflaffins or def-
peradoes.
Saturn produces blindnefs by cataradls and colds, or by pin and web,
a$d by fuchlike accidents ; but, if Venus be pofited in any of the above-
mentioned angles, particularly in the weft, configurated or joined with
Saturn, and Mars at the fame time elevated, or in oppofition, the males
then born will be incapable of propagating their fpecies, and the females
either wholly barren, or fubjeft to abortion, or to the bringing forth of
itill-born children, or to fuch as adhere to the womb, and are obliged to
be feparated by manual operation, or brought away in pieces. This moil
commonly happens in the figns Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn. But if
the Moon be at the fame time in the afeendant, configurated with Mer­
cury or Saturn, and applying to Mats, what are then born will partici­
pate in the nature of both fexes, and perhaps be void of a natural paf-
fage. It is likewife found, that, if the Sun be configurated with M er­
cury, and both the luminaries difpofed after a mafeuline manner, the
Moon decreafing, and the malefic ftars afeending in .the following de­
grees, the males will be deprived of the members proper for generation,
or be irreparably blemiihed or inefficient in them, particularly in the
figns Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Aquaries; and the females will
be naturally barren all their lives.

Of the natural BENT and QUALITY of the MIND.
Such is the doflrine of bodily accidents, a
s deducible fromthe faceof
a genethliacal figurej but the qualities of the m
ind, a
s ration
al an
d
m
ental, arcjudged of fromthe conftitution of M
ercury with regard to
different figns an
d planets. That which appertains to the fenfc alone,
or that ren
d
ers it irrational, is con
fidered from the m
ore corporeal ftate
of the lum
inaries; that is, of the M
oon an
d ftars configurated by fepa-
ration o
r application. But, fince the anim
al inclination is various, this
fpeculationis contem
plated fromm
any an
d divers obfervations, accord­
ing to the diverfity of figns which contain M
ercury an
d the M

the ruling ftars which have dom
inion in them
, an
d that confertheir in­
fluences to the tem

d quality of the m
indj together with the con­
figurations of thofe ftars which have refpe& to the Sun an
d the angles
confidered a
s to the proper an
d diftinft n
ature with which each of
them ait upon the m
ental m
otions of each individual. It is there­
fore generally found that tropical figns ren
d
er the native’s m
ind highly
ingenious, full of invention, eagerin the purfuit of m
oral an
d political
knowledge, an
d of great fortitude an
d perfcverance. Double-bodied
figns agitate the m
ind withavariety of whim
fical an
d very uielcfs pur-
fuits, lead the tongue toloquacious habits, an
d induce tonegligence and
folly. Fixed figns fortify them
ind with prudence and-virtue, an
dgive
abias to ceconom
y, chaftity, an
d tem
perance. Again, oriental confi­
gurations produce m
ental qualitiesof aftrong an
dingenious nature, free,

oll rem
arkably obvious in thofegenitures which
have M

ftrongly, but in alefs obvious an
d m
ore obfcure degree j not tending
fo m

hether good or evil,
inftils its ow

al lpirit, with a pow

equal to its predom
inancy in the heavens at the hour of birth« an
d this
energy is either ftrengthened or dim

iliarity of the m
alefics,
the evil inclination is then proportionality corretted, and the m
ind is
m
ore eafily brought to a proper fenfeof its intem

thefam
e rule, thofe who are good an
d juft, becaufe born under afam
i­
liarity of benefic ftars, willingly andchearfully purfue a life of retti-
tudean
d virtue $ and, being naturally fortunate,as well asprudent, their
undertakings generally prove advantageous andprofitable; but, if acon­

exem

ore unprofitable purfuitof worldly concerns,
is fure to m

Let us now turn our obfervation tothat prodigious variety of affedtion

■ Saturn having alone the dom
inion of the m
ental faculties, and ruling
M
ercuryandthe Moon, ifhe be eligibly fituatedin rcfpefl ofthe w
orld
and the angles, will induce the native to an im
perious and covetous
difpofition, rem
arkably fordid, felf-fufficient, and envioust but, if he
be but indifferently pofited in refpe& to the angles an
d the world, he
difpofes the m
indto treacherous inclinations, fraught with fuperflition,
cow
ardice, and m
eannefs. If he is found in aconcordant fam
iliarity
with Jupiter, an
d both ingood portions of the figure, they qualify the
m
ind with better inclinations, an
d difpofe it toads of benevolence,
prudence, and m
agnanim
ity j but, if they areconfigurated inevil places
of the figure, they work acontrary effe£l, difpofing the m
ind to turbu­
lence an
d cruelty, an
d to various ads pf hypocrify and fraud. If Saturn
be in goodafpedt with M
ars, an
d well pofited in the figure, he difpofes
the inclination to great an
d arduous undertakings, rem
arkable for in­
trepidity and courage in w
ar, and for awatchful, laborious, inflexible,
an
d colle&ed, m
ind, though m
uch difpofed to ads of violence, tyranny,
andoppreffion; but, if theya
re found inb
adpofitions of thefigure, they
produce am
ind given up to every fpecies of fraud an
d im
pofition, an
d
wholly abandoned to im
piety an
d w
ickednefs. If united to Venus, in
elevated pofitions, he ren
d
ers the m
ind libidinous and luflful, given to
diifipation an
d intem
perance, but fubjed to fufpicion an
d jealouiy in
*
refp
eC
t ofw
om
en; but, if unhappilydifpofed in thehoufes of thefigure,
he will induce the m
ind to the m
oil filthy uncleannefs, an
d to other ads
of the bafeiland m
oilreproachful kind. If Saturnhath fam
iliarity with
M
ercury, inagood pofition, he addi£
ts the m
ind to the fober iludy of
the polite arts, or bends the inclination tothe purfuit of fom
e particular
im
provem
ent or newdifeovery in thefciences; an
d in general ren
d
ers
the difpofition fedate, careful, an
d induilriousj but, if they be confi­
gurated with each other in evil places, they incline to treachery and
unfaithfulnefs, difpofe the m
ind to the recollection of pail injuries, an
d
urge to m
alice and prem
editated revenge. This variety of m
ental af­
fections chiefly proceeds from the influences of Saturn, but they are
m
oderated, an
d differently difpofed, according to the nature an
d force
of thofe rays, which, a
s w
e have feen, are rcfpectively contributed by
the prefence of other planets. .
Jupiter having alone the dominion of the mind, and being well pofited
in the figure, influences the animal foul to the moil noble and exalted
ideas of honour and rectitude, difpofing to magnanimity in the caufe of
morality and virtue, andleading the operative faculties to every praife-
worthy act of generofity and benevolence, but, if Jupiter is pofitedin any
difeordant part of the figure, his influences have lefs effect; for, though
i they
o i A S T R O L O G Y . A 4i
they im
print the fam
e natural im
pulfe upon the m
ind, leadingto all good
andm
oral purfuits, yet it isin a m
uch m
ore faint and obfeure m
anner,
being accom
panied with agreat degree of indolence and ina&ivity. If
Jupiter hath configuration with M
ars in agood pofition, he produces a
fiery and im
petuous difpofition, bold, daring, andcourageous, an
d given
to the purfuit of great an
darduous enterprifes; but, if evilly difpofed
with M
ars in the figure, he induces to an unm
erciful, feditious, and
unitable, m
ind, pronetoturbulenceand faction, andgiven up to all the
irregularities of an evil and difiipated inclination. If Jupiter be in
fam
iliarity with Venus, and w
ell poiited, he difpofes the m
ind to fenti-
m
ents of liberality and juitice, gives ingenuity and perfeverance, aA
d
ilrengthens the intellect by a capacious memory; but, if placed in
difeordant parts of the figure, he difpofes to the purfuit of fenfual an
d
lafeivious pleafures,.and gives aturn forloofe an
ddiforderly converfation.
If Jupiter hath configuration with M
ercury, and in good places, he
difpofes the m
ind to the purfuit of learning and wifdom
, and gives
thofe natural endow
m
ents of a refin
ed intelledt, which produce the m
odi
accom
pliihed politicians, orators, poets, painters, o
r m
athem
aticians;
and is indeed one of the m
oil happy configurations that attuate an
d
govern the m
ental faculties; but, if he hath a
n evil configuration with
M
ercury, he induces the m
ind to vanity an
d enthufiafm
, leads to felf-
conceitednefs an
d fuperilition, an
d gives levity, loquacioufnefs, an
d fu-
perficial ideas.
*
M
ars having alone the dom
inion of the m
ind, an
d tvell poiited in the
figure, produces a bold, confident, an
d intrepid, fpirit, given to violence
and w
ar, im
patient, tyrannical, an
d arbitrary, interm
ixed with a
n ex­
ternal ihew of rectitude and generofity; but, if unhappily difpofed, he
influences the m
ind to barbarity an
d m
alevolence, given to im
placable
hatredand inhum
an revenge, an
d difpofes the foul to the perpetration
of the m
oil dark an
d m
alicious a
£
ts of cruelty an
d fraud. Having fa­
m
iliarity with Venus, an
d happily fituated in the figure, he gives a
m
ind fraught with liberality an
d chearfulnefs, difpofed to fincerity and
friendihip, to circum
fpedion an
d fobriety, an
dfond of m
irth and plea-
fure; but, if in a
nevil pofition of the figure, he inclines to dtunkennefs
anddebauchery, an
d furniihes a m
ind given to treachery, deceit, and
every fpecies of im
m
orality. If M
ars hath fam
iliarity with M
ercury in
a profperous ilation, he gives a m
ind happily form
edfor the conducting
of m
ilitary ornaval affairs, furniihes the foul with a thiril for great and
noble actions, an
d fortifies it with tem
per, deliberation, coolnefs, con­
fidence, and m
agnanim

ind, at the fam

We m
ay likewife add, that M

produces am

ent of any kind of bufinefs; but, if they irradiate each other at adif-
tance of twenty o

unfit for bufinefs, or anyaC

If the benevolent planets Jupiter and Venus have fam

O
f WEALTH a
n
d RICHES.
We havehitherto conlideredonly fuch parts of the native’s geniture
asrelate to theaccidents of his body an
d m
ind, an
d the general qualities
incident to them
, a
s well before a
s after the birth. From thefe the
/peculations naturally follow which regard the contingencies of them;
whereof thofe appertaining to tem
poral pofleflions feem peculiarly to
agree with what concerns the body, an
d thofe which relate to honour
and dignity feem m
ore particularly toflow from the qualities of the
m
ind*
To afeertain, therefore, the kind an
d quality of worldly pofleflions,
inany rational degree, w
e are to confider of the polition of the Part of
Fortune, with the nature an
d ftrength of the planet which rules it, to­
gether with his configurations an
d pofitions in re
fp
e
d
l* to other ftars.
For, w
hatever planet aflum
es the lordihip of thePart of Fortune,if ftrong
an
d well dignified, he will aflurcdly contribute w
ealth an
d riches, but
m
ore abundanty an
d lading w
hen the lum
inaries give teftim
ony to him
by irradiating the place of his poiition. It is to be obferved that Saturn
gives an increafeof w
ealth by the im
provem
ent an
dcultivation of lands,
or by buildings or navigation. Jupiter contributes riches by the con­
fidence andlove offriends, which produce legacies an
d patrim
ony ; alfo
by preferm
ent inthechurch. M
ars conduces to wealth by w
arfare, in­
trepidity, an
dgood generalfhip. Venus, by friendihip, gifts, andm
ar*
riage. Mercury by fcience, oratory, or perfeverance in bufinefs.
Saturn having familiarity with the part of Fortune, and configurated
at the fame time with Jupiter, promiles lands and hereditaments; par­
ticularly if pofited in a fuperior angle, and Jupiter occidental in a double­
bodied fign, or in application with the Moon; for then, being adopted,
the native will become the heir of others. And, if thofe ftars, which are
of the famenature with thefignificator of the Part of Fortune, give tefti­
mony of dominion, the poffeffion will remain with the native; but, if thofe
of a contrary quality are elevated above the lord which has dominion, the
poiTefiion will be of no duration, and future riehca precarious. The ge­
neral time of thefe events is takenfrom the inclination of the ftars which
produce the caufe in reipect to the angles and fucceedents* It may alfo
3 be
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 447
be further obferved, that if thefe lor9softhe Part of Fortune, com
m
only
called fignificatorsof riches, areinanangularportion, theacquifitionof
wealth will happenin youth j and, if on the cufps of thofe angular po­
rtions, ftill earlier. If they are pofited in fuccedents, the riches will
prefent them
felves at a m
iddle agej if in cadent houfes, either late or
in extrem

Of D I G N I T I E S an
d HONOURS.
Things which relate to honour an
d dignity are deduced from the
difpolition of the lum
inaries, an
d the fam
iliarity of the ftars by which
they arefurrounded. W
herefore, if both the lum
inaries at the tim
e of
birth a
re found in m
afculine figns, angular, an
d attended by the five
planets, the Sun by oriental ftars, an
d the M
oon by occidental, thofe
perfons will afpire to extraordinary pow
er an
d dignity, an
dexercifeau­
thority and dom
inion over others, fromw
hence great tribute an
d ho­
nour will flow. And if thefe forrounding planets a
reangular, or con­
figurated to a cardinal houfe above the earth, they will be great an
d
powerful in afuperior degreej but ftill m
ore fo, if the attendingplanets
m
akeadexterconfiguration to theangles above theearth, with the Sun
in am
afculine fign, an
dthe M
oon in a fem
inine ; for then the native
will arrive toa pow
erlike that of princes, having abfolute dom
inion an
d
governm
ent, difpofing, in acom
parativedegree, oftheiflues of lifean
d
death.
Butif thelum
inaries happen tobe thus pofited, an
d n
on
e of the fur­
rounding planctsareinangularftations, n
orgiveteftim
ony totheangles,the
native will be great an
d honourable a
s a m
agiftrate or general, but not
a
shaving dom
inion or princely dignity. So if the furrounding planets
a
re fom
e or m
oft of them in angular ftations, or configurated to the
angles, yet, if the lum
inaries a
renot inangular politions alio, thenative
will not arrive to fuch illuftrious preferm
ent, an
d will but m
oderately
excel in dignityan
dhonour. But, if neither of the attending planets is
configuratedtotheangles, the native will beobfeure, an
d p
a
l's his whole
life without prom
otionor dignity ; an
d ifneitherof the lum
inariesare at

hatever purfuit the native engages, propertothis m

It mud alfo be obferved, that the quality of the figns in which thefe

ade, an
d w
herein the lords of theprofeffion are pofited,
confers to the variety an

an
ihape conduce am
azingly to the perfection of all thofe fciencesan

Four-footed figns contribute to thegreater perfection of m
etallic arts,
navigation, and architecture. Tropical and equinoctial figns forw
ard

athem

Again, if the M

guration with M
ercury, at her conjunction with the Sun, either in
Taurus, Capricorn, or Cancer, fhe will conduce togreater fagacity an
d
penetrationin w

Of M A R R I A G E .
To what h
as been faid follows the confideration of m
arriage, or the
fit conjunflion an
dliving together of m
an an
d w
om
an, according to the
divineordinanceof thefuprem
e Being. And, a
s this law w
as evidently
eitabliihed fromthe beginning of things, a
s well for the propagation of
the fpecies asforthe m
utual com
fort an
d happinefs of the fcxes, it w
ere
fenfelefsto fuppofehum
an n
ature void of the im
pulfe of reciprocal love;
orthattheinvoluntaryaftionsofthefoul, byw
hich itism
ovedtow
ardsthe
objedt of its affedtions, have not a radical caufe in the order of nature.
If this be adm
itted, it cannot furely be deem
ed a fubjedt of ridicule, to
believe that this, a
s well a
s the other im
portant tran
fad
tion
sof ourlives,
m
ay be fought out by acontem
plation of the celeftial bodies.
To inveftigate this point, therefore, in refpcdt to m
en, let the pofi-
tions and conftitutions of the M
oon be particularly confidered. For,
w
hen the is found in the oriental quadrants at'the tim
e birth, ihe
influences the native to the confum
m
ation of m
arriage at anearly period
of his life; but, if pofitedin the occidental quadrants, he will probably
live Angle till the approach of old age, an
d then m
arry avery young
wom
an. If the M
oon be afilidted by the Sun-beam
s, an
d in configura­
tion with Saturn, in eitherof thefe pofitionsthe nativewill neverm
arry
at all. If ihe be found in afign of on
e form
, an
d m
akingapplicationto
one planet only, the native will m
arry but once; but, if pofited in a bi­
corporal or fign of m
any form
s, and m
aking application to feveral ftars
in the fam
e fign, he will be feveral tim
es m
arried. And, if the ftars
which receive the M
oon’sapplication, eitherbyaconjunction, fextile, or
trine, are bencfic, the w
ives will begood an
d virtuous; but, if the ap­
plication be m
ade to m
alefic planets, an
d by evil configurations, they
will be altogether of an oppofite defcription. Therefore, if Saturn re­
ceives the M
oon’s application, it indicates alaborious, but fullen, fro­
w
ard, and ungovernable, wife. If it be m
ade to Jupiter, ihe will befree,
open, andgenerous, truly virtuous, an
d a good houfewife. If to M
ars,
ihe
45+ A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
flic will be bold, ftubborn, an
d refraftory. If to Venus, cliearful,
com
placent, affable, an
d chafte. If toM
ercury, wife, prudent, loving,
an
d conflant. But, if M
ars irradiates the place, fhe will be furly, paf-
iionate, talkative, an
d unfteady.
For the particulars of m
arriagein refpeft ofw
om
en, w
earetoconiider
the poiitions of the Sun, in
ftead of theM
oon ; for, if he be fituated in
the oriental houfes, at thetim
e of birth, the native will eitherm
arryvery
young, or elle at a
nadvanced tim
eof life to ayoung m
anj but, if the
Sun be found in the occidental houfes, fhe will m
arry late, or to am
an
far advanced in years. And alio, if he be fituated in afignof oneform
,
fhe will m
arry but once; but, if inafign of m
anyform
s, orconfigurated
to m
any oriental ftars, fh
e will have m
ore hufhands than one, w
ho will
partake of the fam
e n
ature an
d qualities a
s the ftars to which the confi­
gurations are m
ade. Thus, Saturn, if configurated to the Sun, will
indicate fober, grave, an
d laborious, hufbands, but cold an
dphlegm
atic.
Jupiter difpofes themto m
ore opennels of m
ind, an
dgenerolity. M
ars
m
akes them violent, w
arm
, unruly, paflionate, an
d arbitrary. Venus
foreihew
s them to be indulgent, fond, good-natured, an
d handfom
e.
M
ercury difpofes themto be careful, prudent, induftrious, an
dfaithful.
But, if Saturn be joined with M
ercury, they will be churlifh an
d re-
ferved; if with Venus, they will bedull, four, an
dinconftant: if with
M
ars, quick, lively, luftful, an
d fondof variety. Thofe are here to be
confidered the oriental quarters in refpedt of theSun, which precedethe
oriental an
d occidental fign of the zodiac ; and, in refpeil of the M
oon,
thole from her new and full to her other quarters and the occidental
houfes a
rethofe which fall oppofite to theforegoing.
As to events that occur after m
arriage, that is adifferent fpeculation,
an
d requires greatattentionto the following particulars. W
henever the
geniture of both huiband an
d wife have the lum
inaries configurated in
m
utual agreem
ent, that is, in trine or fextile to eachother, they will
live together in com
fort and harm
ony, an
d for a long continuance of
tim
e, if thelum
inarieshappento be in m
utual reception. And this du­
ration will ftill be m
ore firmand lafting, if thepoutionof thehufband’s
M
oon agrees with that of the Sun in the wife’s geniture. But, if the
pofitions of the lum
inaries a
re placed in figns inconjun6t, andconfigu­
rated by quartile or oppofition, they will either live together in difeord
and enm
ity, an
d be rent by violent jealoufies an
dcontention, or elfe be
fully an
dfinally eftranged fromeachother.

Again, if the beneiic rays of the fortunateplanetsbehold the configu­
rations of the lum
inaries in m
utual reception, the m
arriage will be
durable, conftant, happy, and profitable; but, if the m
alefic planets
irradiate thofe places, the m
arriage will be unhappy, contentious, an
d
m
iferable. If the lum
inaries are not configuratedin m
utual reception,
yet if the benefics give teftim
ony to them
, the m
arriage will be m
ode­
rately happy an
ddurable; and, w
hen ftrife an
d difagreem
ents happen,
the fam
e will w
ear off, an
d reconciliation w
ill take place betw
een them;
but, if the m
alefics give teftim
ony to the difcordant pofitions of the lu­
m
inaries, inconftancy and infidelity will eniue, an
d the m
arriage will
be difT
olved with S
can
d
al an
ddifgrace. If M
ercury be joined w
ith the
m
alefics, the S
ep
aration will be for hatred and diilike, and by m
utual
confent; but, if Venus gives teftim
ony to them
, it will beadivorce, by
duecourfe of law, for infidelity an
d adultery.
M
arriages, in other refpe&s, areconfidered from the fam
iliarities and
connexions of Venus, M
ars, an
d Saturn. For, if thefe are all three
configurated with the lum
inaries, the m
arriage will be good, dom
eftic,
an
d profitable; by reafonof the affinity which the benefic planet Venus
hath with M
arsandSaturn; with M
ars, becaufeof youthan
dfloridcoun­
tenance, feeing they have exaltation in m
utual trigonal figns, a
sM
ars in
Capricorn the triplicity of Venus, an
d Venus in Pifces the triplicity'
of Mars; or M
ars in Pifces the exaltation of Venus, an
d Venus in
Capricorn the exaltation of M
ars. So likewife Capricorn an
d Libra are
com
m
on to Saturn an
d Venus; for Venus in Libra hath houfe, andSa­
turn triplicity; and in Capricorn Saturn hath houfe, and Venus tripli­
city ; an
d hence (h
e b
ears relation to Saturn by an older com
plexion,
feeing they have their houfes trigonal to each other. W
herefore Venus
with M
ars conduces to m
ake the inclinations m
ore fond and am
orous;
and M
ercury, giving teftim
onyto them
, qualifies the paffions, and keeps
the fenfual appetite within rational bounds. If Venus be found in any
of the above fam
iliar andprom
ifcuous figns, the indicates m
arriages be­
tw
een kinfm
en an
d relations; or, if ffic b
e with the M
oon in am
afcu-
line geniture, it predi&s that two lifters, or n
ear relations, will bem
ar­
riedto thefam
e m
an; but, if (h
ebe thus configurated toJupiter, or th
e.
Sun, in afem
inine geniture, it fhew
s the w
om
an will m
arry two bro­
thers, or two m
en that arenearly related.
It is likewife obfervable, that, in all cafes w
here Venus is thus con­
figurated to Saturn, in the place of m
arriage, the connubial ftate
will be blifsful and happy to the native; and, if M
ercury bejoined
with them
, headds profperity; but, if M
ars befubftitutedinbisplace,
No. 23. J S the
4s6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
the m
arriage will be altogether w
retched, contentious, an
d unhappy.
If M
ars be configurated to Venus, Saturn, an
d M
ercury, the native
m
arries w
ithaperfon nearly of a
n equal age; but, if he b
e pofitedin an
oriental or eafterly R
ation, the native m
arries with aperfon m
uch youn­
ger; and, ifina
noccidental orw
efterlyR
ation, w
ithaperfonm
uch older,
if Venus an
d Saturn b
e found in prom
ifeuous figns, fuch a
s Capricorn
o
r Libra, the native will m
arry am
ong his ow
n kindred; but, if this
configuration is m
ade upon the cufps of the horofeope or m
id-heaven,
irradiated by the M
oon, an
d the geniture b
e m
afeuline, the native will
luft after his ow
n fifler, aunt, or mother-in-law; or, if the geniture be
fem
inine, (h
e will have d
efire unto h
er ow
n brother, uncle, o
r daugh­
ter’shuiband. Should the Sun irradiatetheplace, inftead of the M
oon,
then the m
ales will have d
efire tow
ard their daughters, or fon’s wife;
and thefem
ales to their fons, nephew
s, or fifter’s huiband.
Obfervation likewife proves, that, if Venus an
d Saturn are configu­
rated neither in am
afeuline n
orfem
inine fign, but in thofe of a
n oppo-
fite quality, which a
re alike in fex, but contrary in nature; o
r in thofe
that a
re ruled by places of acontrary nature, a
s Capricorn is ruled by
Saturn an
d M
ars, an
d Pifces by Jupiter an
d Venus; the native will be
prone to luft, of aloofe converfation, an
d im
m
odeft carriage; m
orepar­
ticularly if the configuration b
e m
ade in the firft o
r latter degrees of
Aries, n
ear the H
yades, in the latter degrees of Leo, o
r upon the face
of Capricorn. And, if thefe planets occupy the two principal angles,
nam
ely, the afeendant or m
id-heaven, thefelibidinous affetiions will be
the m
ore ftrong, open, an
doffenfive, m
aking theparty glory, a
s it w
ere,
in lafcivioufnefs an
d debaucheries; but it is a m
oft extraordinary cir-
cum
ftance, that the fam
e afp
ed
ts in the northern an
d w
eftern angles not
only conduce to a
n oppofite difpofition, but ren
d
er the native either
barren, deficient, or of evil conform
ation, inrefpedt to the parts necef-
fary togeneration.
The difpofitionof m
en, a
stom
odeft or vicious habits, very m
uch de­
pen
ds o
n the pofition an
d configurations of M
ars ; for, if he be feparat-
ing from Saturn an
d Venus, an
d applying to Jupiter, m
en born at that
tim
e will be difereet an
d m
odeft, decent in their iatercourfes with the
other fex, an
ddifpofed only tothe n
atural ufe. If Jupiteran
dVenus be
configurated to Saturn an
d M
ars, the native will beeafily m
ovedon, and
have afccret d
efire to a
d
ts of venery; but will haveanexternal ihewof
chaftity, an
d labour to avoidthe ftiam
e. If M
ars and Venns are alone
configurated together, or if Jupiter b
ears teftim
ony, the native will be
openly lafeivious, an
d indulge in the m
oft luxuriant enjoym
ents of the
oppofite
O F A S T R O L O G Y . 457
oppofite fex. If one of thefe planets be oriental, and the other occi­
dental, he will be difpofed tow
ardsm
en a
s w
ell a
s wom

are found configurated in theoccidental quarters, the native’s com
pany
ihould be avoided, for he will burn with unnatural d
efires after m
en or
boys; m
ore particularly if the afpect falls in m
aiculine figns, in which
cafe the inclination is m
oft aftoniihingly m
oved tow
ards this infam
ous
an
d ihocking practice. It is likewife to b
e rem
arked, that, if Venus be
alone in an occidental pofition, the native will for the m
oil part have
intercourfe with n
on
e but the m
eaneft an
d m
oft proftituted part of the
fex; but, if M

d m

Such are the caufes which vary the fenfual appetites of men; wc will
now confider thofe peculiar to wom
en.—-If Venus be configurated to
Jupiter, an
d M
ercury gives teftim
ony, the native will be fober, pure,
an
d m

en; but, having fam
iliarity with Mer­
cury alone, fh
ewill privately give herfelf up tofenfual em
braces, though
rem
arkably coy an

e con­
figurated to M
ars alone, the native will bew
anton an
dlafeivious ; and, if
M
ercury has fam
iliarity with them
, fhe will be wholly given up tolull­
ful pleafures an

M
ars be com
buft of the Sun, the native will b

ean an
d abjed, fub-
mitting to the ufe of the m
oft vulgar an
d lowed clafs of m

if Venus be com

orere­
ferve an

Of C H I L D R E N .
After theconfiderationof m
arriagefollows that of children. This fpe-
culation is deduced fromthe liars configurated in the m
idheaven, or
fuccedent, which is the eleventh houfe ; but, if n
on
e of the planets are
found in thefe places, then the oppofite ones a
re to be confidered. The
Moon, Jupiter, an
d Venus, arc the givers of children; but the Sun,
M
ars, an
d Saturn, occasionilerility, or paucityof children. Mercury,
a

if they are difpofed after afem

In all thefe cafes it m

Of the Natural INCLINATION for TRAVELLING.
The circum
ftances which relate to travelling are confidered fromthe
petition of thelum
inaries in refpert to theangles, but chiefly fromthofe
of the M
oon ; for, if fhe be found in the feventh houfe, an
d declining
fromangles, fhe denotes acontinual difpofitionfor travelling, an
dperpe­
tual change of place, to the native. M
ars himfelf being occidental, or
declining fromthe m
idheaven, and having anoppotite or quartile peti­
tion to the lum
inaries, will producethe fam
e inclination in afom
evvhat
lefs degree. But, if the part of fortune falls in the fam
e tign with the
tigniticator of travelling, the principal part of the life and actions of
the native will be fpent in aforeign country.
W
henever the benevolent planets irradiate theabove-m
entioned places
of the lum
inaries, o
r M
ars, or the part of fortune, or fucceed to them
,
the native’s travelling will be glorious and profitable, and his return
fafe an
d without impediment; but, if the m
alevolent liars behold or
fucceed, the contrary effeds will be foundto happen. Inall thefecafes,
however, the quality an
dtem
peram
ent of the fm
aller fam
iliarities, asthey
add to or take from the pow
er and force of theirconfigurations, m
uft
be invariably attended to. If the lum
inaries incline or fall to the ori­
ental quadrants, the travelling will be tow
ards the eaftern or fouthera
partsof the globe, confidered in refpett to the placeof birth; but, if
they arefound inthe occidental quadrants, the peregrination will be to­
w
ards the north or w
eft. If the Jign
s in which the fignificators of tra­
velling are pofited be of one form
, either in rcfpe£
t of them
felves, or
of the ftars which have the lordfhip over them
, the travelling will be
far,
46a A N I L L U S T R A T I O N
far, but at intervals; but, if the iigns are double-bodied, or of two‘
form
s, it will be perpetual, an
d of vaft extent. It m
ud how
ever be
hereobferved, that, though the caufes an
d fuccefs of travelling are in­
fluenced by M
ars an
d the part of fortune, yet the quarter tow
ards
which the peregrination ihall be is only to be known fromthe poli-
tion of the lum
inaries.
If Jupiter an
d Venus are rulers both of the lum
inaries an
d places of
the figure which induce travelling, the journeys will not only becom­
pleted without danger, but they will alfo be pleafant, healthy, and
agreeable; for, by the good governm
ent of the countries he vifits, and
the accidentalm
eeting of friends, hewill m
eet with hofpitalityan
dkind-
ncfs ; the constitution of theair, an
d the plenty of neceflaryaccom
m
oda­

e tim
e to his health an
d prefervation; and,
if M
ercury bejoined to the aforefaid configuration, a
nadditional ihareof
honour, profit, and inform
ation, will bederivedfromthejourney; but,
if Saturnan
d M
ars poflefs or govern the places of the lum
inaries, at a
great difiance from each other, they will occafion great dangers an
d a
variety of ill fortune in the courfe of the journey. Being in m
oifi figns*
they denote m
isfortune by ihipwreck, or falling into defolate an
d inac-
cefiible places; in fixed figns, by precipices, or tem
pefiuous an
d con­
trary winds; in tropical an
d equinoctial figns, by w
ant of provifions,
by alcorbutic or epidem
ic diforder, orbyafickly tem
peratureof theair;
in hum
anfigns, by the fudden attack of m
ountaineers an
d robbers, of
favages, or am
bufcades; inearthy figns, by the attack of wild an
d fe­
rocious anim
als, or by falling into pits, or fubterraneous places; but
if M
ercury gives teftim
ony in any of the foregoing cafes, the danger
m
ay arife fromvenom
ous creatures, or by poifon, or fom
e villainous
accufation.
Thefe arethe general confiderations; but the m

Of the APHETA, HYLEG, PROROGATOR, or SIGNIFICATOR
of LIFE, an
d thePlaces proper thereto.
The aphetic, hylegiacal, or prorogatory, places, a
re thofe particular
places of the figure, or of the heavens, fromw
hence the apheta, hyleg,
prorogator, o
r fignificator of life, is to be taken. Thefe appellations
have all the fam
e m
eaning, an
d fignify that planet or ftar which is lord o f
life. The firft is derived from the Greek, the fecond fromthe Hebrew,
and the latter fromthe Latin.
The hylegiacal or prorogatory places a
re in num
ber five, viz, the
afeendant, the feventh, ninth, tenth, an
d eleventh, houfes, an
da
re ta­
ken from the five degrees next an
d im
m
ediately above the cufp o
r the
afeendant to the twenty-five degrees below the cufp of the fam
e, com­
puted by oblique afeenfion. In the fam
e m
an
n
er the prorogatory places
are determ
ined in the feventh, ninth, tenth, an
d eleventh, houfes; for
inftance, it is com
puted from the five degrees in the eighth houfc, to
the m
iddle of the eleventh houfe, tow
ards the twelfth ; which m
iddle
is eafily found, by adding half the fem
idiurnal arch to therightafeenfion
of the m
ediumcadi, an
d w
here that en
d
s is the m
iddle of the eleventh
houfe; the part beyond which is not hylegiacal or prorogatory. Now
thefe only a
re the places in which the planet who aflum
es the pow
er of
hyleg or giver of life canbe found ; for w
hatfoever is under the earth
is not fit for fuch dom
inion; n
or isany pofition abovetheearth, which
hath not configuration to the horofeope. The twelfth houfe, therefore,
which is called the evil angel, is not prorogatory, becaufeit not only de­
clines from the angle, but alfo m
akes the influence of the flats poiited
therein of anevil tendency, fince it difturbs, an
da
s it w
ere deftroys, the
thick vapour proceeding fromthe m
oifture of theearth, w
hereby they
becom
e contrary to n
ature both in colouran
d m
agnitude.
If thenative’sbirth be by day, the Sun (hall be taken for hyleg, pro­
rogator, or giverof life, if he b
efoundin any of the foregoing hylegiacal
places; if hebenot, thenobferve w
hether theM

if neither of the lum

If the tim

above-m
entioned conditions, a

an

ediumcceli; next,
in the alcendant; then, in theeleventhhoule; next to that, the feventh;
and, laftly, the ninth houle. According tothis order, therefore, by the

Of the ANARETICAL or KILLING PLANET, an

QUALITY of DEATH.

if any benevolent configuration irradiates the place, the native's life will

in order tojudge of the quality ofdeath. If thefe deitruCtive beam

configurations of the ftars m
ade thereto being likcvvife confidered, to­
gether with the nature of the figns and the term
s in which they fall.
Saturn, poffefiing the dom
inion of death, caufeth death by chronic
diitem
pers, phthyfics, fluxes, agues, difeafes of the lpleen, droplhs,
iliac an
d hyfteric diitem
pers, and, in a w
ord, by all thole diforders
arifing fromabundanceof cold. Jupiterproducethdeath by the quinzey,
inflam
m
ation of the lungs, apoplexy, cram
ps, and cardiac affections, and
by thofe diforders which happen with vehem
ent an
d ftinking breath­
ing. M
ars caufeth deathbycontinual fevers, fem

d nephritic affeC
tions, Ipitting of blood an
d hem
orrhage, by abortion
an
dbirth, an
d St. Anthony’s fire, and by all diforders which arife from

d giving of poilon; and, in a word, by all thofe com

which proceed fromabundance of m

an
dextraordinary circum
ftances of the death proceed fromthe teffim
ony
of the lights; an
d its quality is known fromthe reft of the afpedting
liars, an
d the figns containing the m
alefics. Saturn therefore in quar­
ter or oppolition to the Sun, orientally, an
din fixedfigns, caufcthdeath
by fuft'oeation, tum
ults of the people, o
r by hanging or ftrangling; in
like m
anner he doth the fam
e if he be occidental, an
d theM
oon follow;
or, if he be in beaft-like figns or places, hecaufeth toperilh by beafts;
an
d Venus, being jointed to them
, caufcth death by poifon, or by the
treachery of w
om
en. If he is in Virgo or Pifces,or in m
oift figns, con­
figurated tothe M
oon, he will caufe death by w
ater, by being fuffocated
an
d drow
ned; if he be about Argo, by ihipwreck; if he be in tropical or
equinoctial figns, the Sun being with him
, or oppofing, or if M
ars be
there, he will caufedeathbytheeffects of afall ; if they areinthetenth
houfe, death will happen by precipitation fromon high; thus Saturn
caufes thefe effects, being configurated to the lum
inaries.
M
ars in quartile or oppofitionto the Sun, an
d the Sun or M
oon ori­
ental, in figns of hum
an form
, will caufe death by flaughter, either
civil o
r hoffilc, or by laying violent hands upon him
felf. If Venus give
teffim
ony, deathwill enfue by m
eans of women; if M
ercury be configu­
rated to them
, death will enfue by robbers, an
d evil doers, an
d pirates.
If he be in m
utilated or im
perfedt figns, or with the Gorgon of
Pcifeus, he will inducetodeath by beheading, or by the effed
tof am
pu­
tation. Being found in Scorpioor Taurus, he will caufedeath by m
e­
dical cuttingan
dburning, orbycontractions; but, if he be found inthe
m
idheaven, or oppofitetothem
idheaven, he will caufedeath byhanging;
particularlyif he befoundabout Cepheusan
dAndrom
eda. If hebefound
in the w
eft, or oppofite to the horofeope, he will caufe deathby firej
but, if he be found in fourfooted figns, he will caufe deathby falling, or
by the breaking of lim
bs. If Jupitergives teffim
ony to M
ars, an
d he
evilly affected, death will happen through the anger of*princes, or by
condem
nation. If the m
alefics efpecially agree together, and both of
them evilly affed
i any of the faid places, they m
ake the.cruelty of the
death the greater. The quality of death, an
d the ruling thereof, alw
ays
will

happen in ftrange places w
hen the ftars which poffefs the anaretic point
fall fromangles; an
defpecially w
hen the M
oon is either found with, or
in quartile or oppoiition to, the faid places.
Thus the caufe an

nificator, either direC

How to direct the S U N to any AfpeSl, being under tbe E arth, in the Space

The Sun, being found in the fpace of twilight, ought to be direfled
above parallel circles to the horizon, an

look out the diftance of the diredtion, that is to fay, w

be obferved.

Suppofe afignificator to be pofited in the tenth houfe, an
d to be di­
rected tothe lextile of aprom

take the diftance of th
e fignificator in right afeen
fion from the tenth

ary diftance; then take the diftance of the
prom

henfound, a
d

cator h
ad b

r in the
ninth houfe, then the prim
ary diftance m
uft be fubtracted from the fe-
condary, an
d the rem
ain
der will be the arch of direction. The fam
e
ruleis tob
e follow
edfor the quartile afpect, if the prom
ittor be in the
alcendant; but, if theprom
ittor b
epofited either inthe fecondor fixth
houfe, then the fam
e ru
le m

Another Way.
If afignificator b

h
is right uLenfion, an
d the right afeen
fion alfo of the prom

It m
ay here be rem
arked, that, if the fignificator an
d prom
ittor be
upon or within three degrees of the cufp of any other houfe, the direc­
tion is the fam
e with the houfe, an
d m
ay be directed under the pole of
that houfe, or by right afcenfion if upon the m
id-heaven a
s before ;
but, if they areinthe defcending part, then ufetheoppofite places. For
example: fuppofetheSun w
ere tobediredted to afextileof Jupiter, the
Sun being o
n the cufp of the ninth houfe, in five degrees of Leo, an
d
Jupiter ineighteen degrees of Cancer, the pole of birth being forty-four
degrees. NowI takethe oppofite fign an
d degree, becaufe the Sunan
d
Jupiter a

ninth an
d third houfes a
reeighteen degrees, and the oblique afcenfion
of theSun’s oppofite placeisthree hundredan
d fourteen degrees n
earlyj
fromw
hence I fubtradt fixty degrees, an
d the rem
ainder, which is two
hundredan
d fifty-four degrees, is the obliqueafcenfion of theafeendant.
Now theoblique afcenfionof Jupiter’s oppofite place, u
n
der the pole of
eighteen degrees, is two hundred ninety-feven degrees ; from w
hence I
fubtradl the oblique afcenfion of the afeendant, viz. two hundred an
d
fifty-four degrees, an
d there rem
ains the arch of dirediion required,
which is forty-three degrees•, becaufe, by the m

obile, w

Sun at thefam

To direB a fignificator, being above three Degrees difiant from the Cufp o f

Find the fem

carefully attended to, will be am
ply fuflicient to fam
iliarize any of m
y
read
ers in this im
portant branchof theoccult fciences, without theaidof
which, little or nothing can be done in the calculation of nativities.
For though it b
e adm
itted, that a fludent m

ake great advances in
the know

know that fuch an
d fuch events will certainly com

this acquifition in the feience m
ufl be confidcred incom
plete, without
the ability of pointing out, by forn
c fixed an
d certain rule, the precife
tim
e w
hen thefeevents ihall happen. This is not to be attained by the
m
ethods ufid in the vulgar Aitrology, a
s already laid dow

p
art of this work, w
here the com
m
on Aftrology is treated of, but with
great riik an

dw
as thereforeonly introduced for thepur­
pose of anfw
ering horary queftions, w
herecorrcctnefs, inthis particular,
is little attended to by any m
odern profeflbrs.
This grand acquifition is therefore not tobe obtained by any other
m
ode, than that of bringing u
p the arch of direction of each refpective
fignificator in the native’s figure of birth, to the afpect which denotes
each rdpective event; an
d this arch of direction, a
s I have beforeob-
ferved, is nothing m
ore than the track o
r circle in the heavens form
ed
by the fignificator in m
oving from that particular point in the heavens
w
here he is found at the birth; fo the precife point w
here he form
s the
afpect with the prom
ittor that indicates the event, which, upon his ar­
rival there, is tohappen. It is confequently apparent, that if this track
o
r circle can be found, an
d its content in degrees an

inutes accurately
taken, an

hich m
ay alw

true, which h
as b
een proved by innum
erable exam
ples in all ages of the
w
orld, an
d w
hich I trull w
ill b

it is evident th

with fufficient accuracy to afeertain th

hich th

native. W
here then is the m

poflibility of afeertaining the
period of hum
an life, an

racy wholly depen

e tim
e of birth being obtained; for a
failure h
ere in the rad
ical point will deftroy the w
hole calculation, an
d
nothing predicted therefrom can poflibly happen but by the effect of
chance.
But it is h
ere n
eceflary to rem
ark, that in fuch nativities a

an

on

is required atrain of m

n
d the
interpoiition of on

here feveral m

Of S E C O N D A R Y D I R E C T I O N S .
All the directions hitherto treated of a
re term
edprimary directions,
becaufe they a
re the firft and m
od im
portant of any thing of the kind
in the doC
irin
e of nativities ; an
dwithout the aid of thefe, all aftrologi-
cal calculations would be vain an
d delufive, a
s m
udappear obvious from
w
hat h
as been already prem
ifed. But fecondary directions a
re by no

nextenfive con
federation; n
or of any great utility in the
fcience, that I have a
s yet beenable to difeover, particularly if accuracy
an
dtruth a
re to be preferred in thefe fpcculations. For, by the u
fe of
the prim
ary directions in the calculation of nativities, w
e a
re not only
enabled to judge of the quality an
d influence of the afpedts, but can
likewife trace them to the precife tim
e of their operation; w
hereas the
fecondarydirections at bedonly afford theartid m
atter for fupcrficial en­
quiry an
d vague conjecture. I lhall neverthelefs explain the n
ature an
d
ufe of them in this place, fince it is the planof this w
ork tocom
prehend
every praC
tice hitherto introduced into the fcience of aitrology, with a
viewto enable the read
er to didinguifh the ufeful and rational from the
inutile andredundant part of it.
Byfecondarydirections, then, wea

and fam

d pros­
perous, year to the native, in n
ature an
dquality peculiar to theprincipal
fjgnificatorin each configuration, an
d to the houfes an
d figns inwhich
they fall in the radical figure. But on the contrary, if the M
oon be
joined to m
alevolent ftars, or irradiated by them
, or in parallel declina­
tion cf the infortunes, it forebodes, to thofe years pointed out by the
days in which thefe evil configurations happen, great afflictions either
in m
ind, body, o
reihte ; and, if a prim
arydiredtion ihould correfpond
with them
, of the fune m
alignant nature, a com
plication of tem
poral
m
isfortunes will m
oil probably eniue.
In the confideration of thefe direftions, we a
re particularly to attend
to the critical days a

afterical years ; for at thofe tim
es the good
cr evil configurations of the planets a
re m

inaulpicious configurations w

nevil prim
ary direction, w
ith which
both the revolution an
d tran

nirrevocableindi­
cation of death tothe native.
Thefe fecondary directions, I underftand, have alw
ays b
een in reputa­
tion am
ong theArabs an

ho, incom

on practice, prefer
this m
ethod of predicting fromthe genethliacal figure to the m

­
plicated an
d laborious inode of calculation by the prim
ary directions.
The form
er practice h
a
s doubtlefs the advantage in point of expedition;
for by the ufeof it in thofe countries, they will, upon the b
are inlpect-
tiun of anativity, give a
naccount of the general an
dparticular incidents
duringthe w
hole courfe of the native's life ; an
d yet, by repeated trials
of it m
yfclf, I have found it in m
any inflances erroneous, an
d therefore
not to b

But, upon deliveringjudgem

But, ftiould the femidiurnal or feminodturnal* arches be required for
any latitude not fpecified in the Tables, they may be found thus : Firft,
find the declination of the planet under the pole of birth ; and, if the-
declination falls in any of the fix northern figns, add the difference o f
Afcenfion to ninety degrees, and the fum w ill be the femidiurnal arch, in
degrees and minutes ; if the afcenfional difference be iubtra&ed from
ninety degrees, the remainder will be the femidiurnal arch. But, if the
declination ftiould fall in either of the fix fouthern figns, then fubtradt
the difference of afcenfion from ninety degrees, for the femidiurnal arch ;
and add the afcenfional difference to ninety degrees, for the feminodlur-
nal arch. If the arches thus found are divided by fix, they will give
the horary times, or true length of the planetary hours; and, if divided
by three, they will give the true diftance of one houfc, by. which method
the true divifion of all the houfes may be obtained, according to the
rules of Ptolom y; two of which parts make a Textile, as appears more
obvioufly by the Tabic of Mundane Afpects, wherein are fpecified all the
afpeds that are made in the world.
O f the T A B L E S of T W I L I G H T .
The ufe of thefe Tables, in bringing up the arches of diredlions, hath
been already mentioned ; it will therefore be fufficient in this place to
inform the reader how to make ufe of them. The firft column on the
left hand contains the parallels o f Tw ilight ; and the body of the Tables
ihews the diftance the Sun muft be from the eaftern or weftern angles, that
is, from the afeendant or feventh houfe, to be in thofe parallels; therefore,
whenever thefe Tables are ufed for any calculations, the following me­
thod muft be adopted : Take the oblique afcenfion of the afeendant
under the pole of birth, from whence fubtradt the oblique afcenfion of
the Sun, and the remainder will be its primary diftance, which is to be
fought in the Tables as near as pofiible to that degree which the Sun is
in; which being found, look in the column of Parallels of Tw ilight,
and fee what parallel correfponds with it, for under that parallel the
arch of Tw ilight muft be taken; examples of which will hereafter be
frequently given.
O f the T A B L E S of M U N D A N E A S P E C T S .
The firft column o f thefe Tables contains the femidiurnal and femi-
nofturnal arches, from three to nine hours, calculated to every fix mi­
nutes. In the next column, and oppofite to thefe arches, in a direft
line, is the fpacc of the houfe that the femidiurnal or feminofturnal

arches refpe&ively .give ; and in the fucceeding columns are arranged all
the mundane afpe&s anfwering thereto, truly calculated to the very de­
gree and minute, which are fometimes twice as much as at others; and
the reafon is, becaufe the femidiurnal and feminofiurnal arches vary in
their content to full that amount. '
O f the T A B L E S of R I G H T A S C E N S I O N S .
T o find the right afcenfion of a ftar, the longitude muft be given,
with which enter the left hand column of the table ; and under the fign
and latitude at the top of the columns, in the angle of meeting, is the
right afcenfion required. For example : Suppofe a planet to be pofited in
ten degrees of Aries, and to have two degrees north latitude ; enter the
tables of right afcenfion with ten degrees of Aries, in the left-hand
column, and in the angle o f meeting, under two degrees of north lati­
tude, will befound the right afcenfion thereof, viz. eight degrees twenty-
three minutes.
O f the T A B L E S of D E C L I N A T I O N .
T o find the declination of a planet, the longitude muft be given, with
which enter the table of declinations on the left hand ; and in the column
of longitude, againft the degree of longitude, is the declination fought. I f
the ftar hath latitude, either north or fouth, enter the tables under the
latitude, as the titles direit, always remembering that,' if the ftar be in
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, or Sagittarius, the degrees of longi­
tude to the left hand, beginning at the top of the tables, arc to be
taken; but, if the ftar be in Capricorn, Aquaries, Pifces, Aries, Taurus,
or Cancer, then the degrees of longitude to the right hand, beginning
at the foot of the table, muft be retorted to. Example : Suppole a ftar
in ten degrees of Virgo, with one degree twenty-feven minutes north
latitude; I enter the table of declinations, finding Virgo in the head
o f the table; and againft ten degrees under one degree of latitude I
find eight degrees forty-feven minutes, and againft ten degrees under
two degrees of latitude I find nine degrees forty-two minutes; the dif­
ference is fifty-five minutes. Then, for the part proportional agreeing to
the odd minutes of latitude, I fay, I f fixty give fifty-five, what fiball
twenty-feven give ? It gives twenty-five; which, added to eight degrees
forty-feven minutes, leaves the declination of the point fought, nine de­
grees twelve minutes. But, if the ftar had been in twenty degrees of
Aries, I muft have entered at the foot of the table; and, having the
fame latitude, the fame declination would emerge.

The afcenfional difference is a certain arch of diftance, between the
right and oblique afeenfions o f any ftar or planet, in any degree of the
Ecliptic; and, to find it by the following Tables of Differences, obferve
the following rules. Enter with the degrees of declination on the left
hand o f the Table, and under the circle of pofition in the head, in the
co'mmon angle of meeting, with equation, will be found the afcenfional
difference required. Example : Suppofe a planet to have ten degrees of
declination, and his circle o f pofition be fifty-one degrees forty-two mi­
nutes j I enter with ten degrees on the left hand under the circle of fifty-
one degrees, and there I find twelve degrees thirty-five minutes ; but,
having forty-two minutes more, I take the part proportional between
fifty-one degrees and fifty-two degrees, viz.
Declination ten degrees latitude
Difference

Si 12 3 5
5 2 * 3 3
0 28
Then I fay, by the rule o f proportion, If fixty give twenty-eight, what
fhall forty-two, the odd minutes of the circle*of pofition, give ? It gives
twenty nearly; which, added to twelve degrees tnirty-fiveminutes, gives
the true afcenfional difference, twelve degrees fifty-five minutes of the
point fought.
Having obtained the afcenfional difference, the ufe o f it, in the art of
dirc&ions, is as follow s: Firft, if the declination be north, fubtradt
the afcenfional difference from the right afeenfion, and the remainder
will be the oblique afeenfion ; but, if you add it to the right afeenfion,
the fum will be the oblique dcfcenfion. Secondly, when the declina­
tion is fouth, add the afcenfional difference to the right afeenfion, and the
fum will be the oblique afeenfion; but, if you fubtradl it from the right
afeenfion, the remainder will be the oblique defeenfion. And note,
that the afcenfional difference is only of fervice when the planet or ilar
hath latitude.

O f the T A B L E S of O B L I Q U E A S C E N S I O N S for,
the L A T I T U D E of L O N D O N .
Enter thefe tables-with the degrees of longitude in the left-hand co­
lumn and in the common area, under the fign in the top o f the column,
is the true oblique afeenfion fought. For example, fuppofe the ftar to
be in ten degrees o f Aries, and the latitude of birth fifty-one degrees
thirty- two minutes; look for ten degrees in the fide column under Aries
in the head, and the oblique afeenfion will be four degrees ten minutes
of the point fought. -
T o find the oblique defeenfions by thefe tables, obferve the following
rule: take the oppofite fign and degree, and, if it fall in any of the fix
northern figns, add one hundred and eighty degrees to the oblique afeen­
fion found, and the fum will be the oblique defeenfion of the point fought;
but in the fix fouthern figns fubtradion muft be made, and the ob­
lique de&enfion remains. Exam ple: in the latitude of fifty-one de­
grees thirty-two minutes, I would know the oblique defeenfion o f ten
degrees of Libra. Now I take the oppofite point Aries, which is nor­
thern, and add thereto one hundred and eighty degrees, as follows:
deg. min.
Oblique afeenfion of ten degrees of Ariesis 4 10
Add 180 o
184 10
Thus the oblique defeenfion o f ten degrees o f Libra is one hundred
and eighty-four degrees ten m inutes; but, for the oblique defeenfion of
ten degrees o f Aries, I take the oblique afeenfion of the oppofite point
Libra, which is fouthern, and fubtrad one hundred and eighty degrees
from it, as follow s:
deg. min.
Oblique afeenfion o f ten degrees o f Librais 194 12
Subtrad 180 o
14 12
Thus the oblique defeenfion of ten degrees of Aries is fourteen de­
grees twelve minutes $ and the fame rule will hold good in all fimilar

operations for the latitude of London. I ¿hall likewife give a praxis for
iinding-the oblique afcenfions and defceniions of every other latitude, by
help of the aforementioned Tables o f A fcenftonal Differences.
It would be needlefs to enter into any further explanation, or to adduce
other examples in this place, to (hew the nature and ufe of the following
fct of tables, ftnce we (hall hereafter have frequent occafion to refer to
them in calculating and bringing up the directions of the following
Nativities, which will at once prove the facility and correctnefs with
which any calculations may be found by them, and initiate the young
practitioner into a more intimate knowledge of them, without labour or
embarrailment. W hat I have already premifed on the fubject, has been
merely to demonftrate their general expediency, and to remove thofe fug-
geftions of difficulty and difguft, which are too frequently felt by
common readers upon the frit fight of a collection o f tables, from an
ill-founded apprehenfion that they ihall never be able to underitand
them ; and which confequently is apt to give a fatal blow to the further
progrefs of the itudent. Now the fame objections might be made with
equal propriety to the ufe of the Trader’s Sure Guide, and the Ready
Reckoner, fince both of them confiit of nothing but tables, calculated
to ihew the value of any quantity of goods at any given price, and are
now univerfally made ufe of by perfons wholly unacquainted with the
theory of figures. If, therefore, thefe books can be ufcd with fo
much advantage for the above-mentioned purpofes, by perfons utterly
incapable of performing the moil fimple rules in addition or multipli­
cation, why may not the following tables be reforted to with fimilar
eafe, for folvingany queftions upon the fubjeCt before us ? the anfwer is
obvious, and the utility of the plan unexceptionable.

For finding the Oblique Afcenfions or Defcenfions o f the Planets, fo r any
Latitude, by the help of A rtificia l Sines and Tangents.
FIRS T , The planet’s declination is to be fought.
Secondly, The height of the pole wherein the planet is pofited.
Thirdly, With this enter the fines and tangents, and gain ,the afcen-
iional difference. .

Fourthly, The right afcenfion of the planet muft be found, cither
as it is with or without latitude.
F ifthly, To this right afcenfion, add or fubtradt the afcenfional dif­
ference, according to the declination of the planet, whether it be north
or jfouth, and the oblique afcenfion is found.
If the declination of a ftar is north, fubtradl the afcenfional difference
from the right afcenfion, and the rem
ainder will be its oblique afcenfion ;
but, if added*together, the fum will be the oblique defeenfion of the ilar.
If the declination of a planet is fouth, add the afcenfional difference
and right afcenfion together, and the fum will be its oblique afcenfion ;
but, if you fubtraft, the rem
ainder will be its oblique defeenfion.

be dire£t and the other retrograde, add their diurnal motions together, and
the aggregate is the diurnal excefs. Then take the places of th« planets
from the Ephemefis on the day preceding the afpeCt, and fubtradl the
placeof the planet that is fwifteft in motion from the place of that which
is flower, andthe rem

To find the quartile of the Moon and Saturn on the twelfth of June,
1784. Proceed thus ; Refer to page 179 of this work, and on the twelfth
day at noon the Moon will be found in nineteen degrees feventeen mi­
nutes of Aries, and Saturn in twenty-two degrees fifty minutes of Capri­
corn, retrograde. The diurnal motion of the Moon is thirteen degrees
three minutes, and the motion of Saturn three minutes. Now, as Siturn
is retrograde,rhis motion is to beadded to the Moon's,#
and then the di­
urnal excels makes thirteen degrees twenty-one minutes, with which
enter the table of logarithms ; in the top column feek thirteen degrees,
and in the firft column on the left hand fide feek twenty-one minutes, and
and in the angle of meeting will be found - - 6527
In the fam

III. If afignificator be not pofited in the afcendant o

id-heaven, or
in the oppofitehoufes, then fin

, according w
hether it b

vens, take the oblique afcenfion or defcenfion of the prom
ittor, under

ainder is the archof diredion fought, which
turn into years a

IV. If it berequired to dired the prom
ittor to the fignificator, con­
trary to the fucctflion of* figns, then in
fteadof fubtrading the oblique
or right afcen
fion of the fignificator from the prom
ittor, fubtrad the
oblique or right afcenfion of the prom
ittor from the iign
ifica.tor, and
therem
ainderis the arch of diredtion.
V. If the prom
ittor is to be dirc&ed contrary to the fucceflion of
figns, an
d is fituated in the m
id-heaven or fourth houfe, fubtrad the
right afcenfion of the prom
ittor with latitude, fromthe right afcenfion
oi the fignificator, an
d the rem
ain
der is the arch of diredion, to be
turned into years, &c. by the table.
VI. If a prom
ittor be oriental or occidental above th
e>
earth or u
n
d
er
it, yet not inthe m
id-heaven or fourth houfe, feek its pole of pofition,
an
d thereby gain its true oblique afcenfion or defcenfion w
ith latitude,
an
d fubtrad it fromthe oblique afcenfion ordefcenfion of the fignifica­
tor u
n
d
er the fam
e pole, an
d the rem
ainder is the arch of direction
required.
VII. W
hen‘any planet is to be direded to the oppofite part of the
heavens, itm
uft then be dirededwith oppofite latitude.
VIII. No planet, except the Sun an
d M
oon, can be directed toeither
a textile trine, cr quartile, of its radical place.
* The Sun and Moon, and Venus and Mercury, can only be directedconverfely, that is, contrary to tlic fuc-
ceflion of hgns, tlicy being the only planetscapable of the rapt motion.

oves in thezodiac only, an
dm
eets all bodies or afpeds
therein, it being his unalterable courfe, that is, without latitude; b
.u
t,
w
hen he is directed to a planet or zodiacal parallel with latitude, it is
then called adire&ion in m
undo; but, w
hen direfted to a planet without
latitude, it isterm
ed a zodiacal diredion, andis either direct or converfc,
asthe m
otion of the planet is either with, or contrary to, the fucceffion
of figns.
X. The Moon m
eets all rays in the circle of latitude in which fhe
conftantly m
oves, an
d that is alw
ays out of the ecliptic, except w
hen
ihe is in her n
odes 5 an
d therefore, w
hen ihe is directed, a
s aligrtm
cator
with latitude, to a prom
ittor in the zodiac, the latitude of the m
oon’s
place m
ull befound. Under this latitude, thedeclination mull be fought,
which (hew
s the oblique afcenfion or defcenlion under the pole of the
M
oon 5 an
dhence the arch of diredion is corre6H
y found, by fubtrad-
ing the obliqueafceniion or defcenlion of the M
oon under her pole, not
forgetting that this oblique afceniion or defcenlion m
ull h
e taken ac­
cording to thelatitudeofher place at the hour of birth. This is called
a zodiacal direction withlatitude ; but, w
hen theM
oon is diretied toan
afped without latitude, the place of the zodiac w
here the afpcft falls
is tobe taken without latitude, both in right afceniionand declination ;
and thus find the oblique defcenlion or afcenfion of the point under the
poleofthe M
oon; fromwhichfubtrad theobliqueafceniionordefcenlion
of the M
oon, taken according to the latitude Ih
ehadat the tim
e of birth,
and the arch of diredion is found, which is to be converted into years
as before.
XI. Diredions areof two forts, zodiacal an
dm
undane. The Sun and
M
oon are capable of being direded both w
ays ; but the angles ofafigure
can only be direded in m
undo, they being fubjed to the accidents and
divilion of no circles but thofe which conllitute the m
ealurc of each
quadrant, an
dare m
eafured by the parts of the diurnal an
d fem
inodurnal
arches $ therefore they never m
eet any rays with latitude but bodiesand
oppolitions.
XII. The m
id-heaven an
d afeendant are two different * circles. The
m
id-heaven m
eets all rays, an
d m
eafures all afpeds by the zodiac ; but
the afeendant, by the rapt m
otion or horary circle ; by which m
otion
thediurnal circle is alfo m
eafured, the houfes of heaven divided, an
d
the m
undane afpeds proportionally m
eafured.
• The zodiacal circle meafures fixty minutes to an hour, but the rapt motion, or horary circle, is fometimei
2x10
1e or Ids, according to the length of the femidiunul arch, or planetaiy hour.
