  This was one of the "affective" New Thought journals, devoted to the power of suggestion and the higher self: "In the realization of the Higher Self, and the realization of the presence of the Comforter, all the seeming ills of this life vanish in the incoming light of the dawn of a New Life, which gives to us a knowledge of the Kingdom of Heaven that is with us and of the Lord of our own being. Our very angel—which, 'as a little child,' shall lead us to our inheritance of All-Good," etc.  Contributions by Lucy A. Mallory and Simeon Carter, with extensive notices of other New Thought journals as filler.  Advertised in The Temple, December 1897 ("The Abiding Truth, with its silent Evangel, is devoted to a better understanding of our immortal powers") and in New Man, January 1900.  Fifty cents a year.  Noted in "List of Advance Thought Publications," The New Cycle, March 1900, 159-60; Notes and Queries, June 1900; The Oracle, April 1900; and "List of Advance Thought Publications" in The Metaphysical Magazine, February 1901, 159.
