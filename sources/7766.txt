  		              		Experience Description   

  I was a small freshman who was placed into a senior study hall in high school. There was a large 6 foot 7 inch senior who was generally good-natured and nice. He was well-known but not necessarily popular. He was dressed like he was from the country and would wear big cowboy boots that what accentuate his heavy steps. I would not consider him a bully, but I would say that he enjoyed any attention that he could muster. 

  One day as our study hall monitor was out, this senior picked me up from behind with one arm across my upper shoulders. He swung me around with what I assumed was a big smile and laugh. The class thought it was hilarious. What they didn't know is that his arm had slipped to my neck. I could not get any support for my neck by trying to grab onto his arms. My hands just slipped. I was so embarrassed that I was trying not to create a scene by overtly struggling. I was trying to maintain my dignity, while seeking to escape. 

  All the sudden, I noticed that darkness started to creep in from around me and it gained momentum until everything went black and absolutely silent. 

  In later years I have had several surgeries and am familiar with going unconscious through anesthesia. This experience was nothing like that. 

  Though the lights went out; yet, my consciousness was highly alert. I could no longer hear anyone or anything from in the classroom but I knew that I could hear. I saw nothing but darkness but did not feel blind. I knew that I could see the darkness. It was velvety, soft and comforting. I was also aware that I was no longer a body with structural form.  Instead, I felt like something like a puddle of liquid that had been poured out and was now millimeters thin. But, my awareness was from a single point of observation as though I was seeing and hearing in an all-encompassing way. After spending what seemed like 5 minutes in that space, I became aware of concern being expressed by something outside myself for my well-being. There was a hope and desperation in that feeling. I became aware of the senior in a panic trying to revive me. I came to and found myself on the floor. I pulled away and dragged myself up into my seat and desk. Along with my physical senses, the sense of embarrassment had returned as well. I quickly assured the senior that I was okay and tried my best to alleviate his concerns.
