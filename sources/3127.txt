July, 1953
Well Come! Lord Michael and the Heavenly
Host
Shining Stars of Love and Light among The
August Company dimly perceived by the spiritual
eyes of the Few whose vision turns toward the
slowly rising curtain of maya, are the Members
of the Angelic Host! Arms outstretched! Hearts
Aflame! Spirits pulsating with Celestial Fire! Bid­
ding welcome to the more stalwart among the chil­
dren of earth into that Sweet Association, Com­
panionship, Cooperative Service and Worship
wherein the Angelic Host, hand in hand with the
souls of men, proceed reverently upon The Path
to the Father’s Home, and The Brotherhood of
Angels and Men, presaging the Incoming Golden
Age, stands manifest before the fleshly eyes of
those who must confirm in form the Eternal Ver­
ities.
The Divine Word has gone forth! The Edict
of the Eternal for Perfection, manifest through
every electron of pure and precious life endowed
with the opportunity to unfold its God Nature in
this evolutionary scheme, must be fufilled, and
Those who embody that happy nature which
loves to OBEY the Will of God are first to re-

spond. The Angelic Host! Companions! Guard­
ians! Loving, Vibrant Centers of Radiant and
Comforting God Virtue! are eager beyond words
to come closer to their brothers and sisters of the
human evolution whom They have, in patience,
so long served!
The Guardian Spirits of the Race incarnate
now in human form, some among them members
of this very Kingdom, and others who, in the finer
bodies of the inner life, know well the reality of
the Angels, are among the first to whom the An­
gels come! These Guardian Spirits, embodying
the strength, the love and light of such privi­
leged association, shall—in time—draw back the
curtain further still, through the endeavors of their
own hearts’ light, that mankind may, en masse,
accept this glorious evolution, swinging through
the more dense vibrations that form the ponderous
progression of the souls of men, and which, by
its very proximity, has sustained the opportunity
for life and spiritual immortality upon a star,
whose death garment, woven out of the essence
of man’s use of free will, had signified the closing
of her Book of Opportunity in extinction, to­
gether with the hopes of immortality for its
evolutionary lives. . . .
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 7
Friendship—human and Divine—is builded on
mutual understanding, shared confidence, the
sweet joy of blended energies woven into One
Dream—One Vision—One Cause. To those who
choose to share the companionship of the Angelic
Host, to walk with Them, to gently pour the spir­
itual energies of prayer and evocation into a com­
mon Cup, the “communion of the Saints” is a
“fact” and not a “fancy”, and it is to these Few
that We bring the words within this book, with
the Love of our Hearts and the offer of Divine
Friendship from Lord Michael, Prince of the
Heavenly Host, and His Workers in the Kingdom.

INTRODUCTION
Oh, My Beloved:—
How grateful I Am that again, after the aeons
of time that have contributed so heavily to the
veil of separateness, We see the chasm which
stretched so relentlessly between Our Realm and
that of mankind being bridged through the self
conscious endeavors and the very physical energies
of incarnate lifestreams—alert enough to Perceive
our Reality and loving enough to Desire to “make
their way over” all obstacles into Our Presencel
Some men, standing on the brink of that
abyss . . . looking hopelessly across its seemingly
impassable void, conclude that after form there is
“nothing”! And in their conclusion is some jus­
tice, for their eyes are dimmed to the faint out­
lines of the Eternal that shine in the distance . . .
and they sense and feel only the hopelessness of the
“dead end,” the finality of the journey, as the sharp
cliffs drop abruptly beneath their weary feet . . .
These people lie down in discouragement and pass
from the screen of life to rest awhile in the merci­
ful forgetfulness of the slumbers called “death”.
Others, after bitterly cursing the compass of the
heart that has led to the brink of nothingness,
retrace their steps and find temporary satisfaction
in satiating the senses and rebelliously stimulate
s
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 9
the drive of the soul into the by-paths that seem­
ingly lead to “greener pastures.”
And the Few. . . . Sweet hope of earth and joy
of heaven! calmly appraising the situation, wait
until their spiritual eyes are tuned to act for them
in this new measure, when they—at last—can see
the Further Shore—some distinctly, others as a
mere outline of hope and promise—but once as­
sured, these Few will bend the experiences of life,
to fashioning a way and means of reaching T hat
Sweet Shore. . . . of crossing the abyss—on wings
of faith, on the levitating consciousness, on pro­
jected vision, on the soul strength of one who has
learned the way thither and the selfless renuncia­
tion of the way back. . . .
Whether these Few climb down the préci­
pitions sides, cast a beam of their own heart’s light
across the yawning depths, or weave a rope of
thoughts or prayers or affirmations and cross there­
on, they will attain—but from among the Few . . .
again there are not often those who will return on
the hazardous way.. .. The blessed lifestreams who
offer so to do are the Bridge Builders upon whom
we depend to lay the cables across which all men
will one day receive the God Directions of the Free
. . . and upon which they may, in turn, send the
petitions of their souls. . . .
As this book is prepared for these Few, may
My Personal Blessing rest upon the heart and soul
of all who read, and make of them such Bridge
Builders, until the Angelic Host shall have a
10 BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL
Bridge of Light budded of the Faith, the Love, the
Aspirations of the Sons and Daughters of men, and
over this highway they may walk freely into the
association with those who choose to take their
hands, share their vision, and Worship God in
Obedience to the Law of Harmony and Love, the
Keynote of the Kingdom of Heaven
Archangel Michael
Excerpts From
Addresses of Lord
Michael, the Archangel
The Open Door to the Presence of the Angels
From the Heart of the Realm of Cosmic Fire
I bring to you My Love. Heretofore, I was required
to send the Flame of My protecting solicitude and
devotion.
The Gates of Consciousness—human and Di­
vine—swing on the hinges of free will. No man,
nor Angel nor God can enter the consciouness of
another, unless he is bidden freely so to do . . .
So, the Celestial Gates that open to My Home, My
Heart, My World of Action have long been ajar—
and the Magnetic Power of My Love has ever
drawn your Higher Self within the compass of My,
Presence, when loosed for fleeting moments from
the heavy bonds of flesh. Thus, in the Great Free­
dom and Loving Companionship of those sweet
hours are you enabled to gather the enthusiasm and
love of Heaven which will enable you to bring the
Message and Fire of Heaven earthward to the sons
of men.
But now—at last—you have opened the Doors
of your outer consciousness, your hearts, your
homes, your worlds, and I Am bidden enter! Can
you see what that shall mean for all the sons of
men?
l i
The World of the Angels
The world of the Angels is a world of Love—
a golden sea of pulsing, breathing, radiant Flame,
with the Cherubim and Seraphim disporting
Themselves in the living Heart and Bosom of The
Father. The only pathway to the actual experi­
encing of Their personal presence is Love—but
this Love must be clothed in great inner peace and
tranquillity, as if your innermost being was a sea
of blue water and your consciousness a lotus flower
opening to the Sun of God, resting on the blue
sea and pouring forth the radiance of Its Being.
Dwelling thus in an inner tranquillity and poise,
you may step on soft, reverent feet at any moment
into the presence of the Angels, but the least emo­
tional unrest or nervous tension closes the door
temporarily to Their presence.
12
The Gift of Love
Is it possible in the fullness of God’s Love
to intensify the feeling of that love for any one
part of Life? It would seem that such pressure
directed toward any individualized intelligence
would be, again, the separation of life into form!
Yet, by the very nature of the magnetic power of
The Immortal Flame which is the Identity of the
Being—human or divine—without direction—
that Love naturally flows toward the other part of
Itself. As water seeks its own level, and as like
attracts like, here and hereafter, so does the on-
rushing substance of Love Divine find its complete
ness in the heart of the Beloved—unbidden by
the conscious mind!
Ah—in the pouring forth of Love Divine—
there can truly be no selfishness, for all the world
is enriched by the radiation that bathes the Loved
One in that Uplifting Presence, and the Beloved
becomes a Fountain for the very Life of the
Angelic Host, that—in receiving—such an one
becomes, too, a transmitter of Love through the
aura to all of Life!
So, now, as you receive My Love, know it is
not only the Gift of My very Self to your sweet
hearts, but also a Gift, through your sweet hearts,
to mankind everywhere.
13
The Casual Body
I Am so eager for you to unfold the natural
talents and capacities of your lifestreams. Once
you look upon the living colors that make up
your Causal Body and see the tremendous stored
up energies that await release through your life-
stream, you will be so tremendously encouraged.
Those glorious momentums are yours to use at
any moment when you are able to Accept their
Reality as part of your Divine Heritage.
The Healing Melodies that were released
through the dispensation of the Karmic Counsel
are so beautiful. I Am sure we shall see some
marvelous manifestations of God Light “riding
into the physical world” on the currents of sound.
14
The Contagious Power of Faith
I shall, through the Love of My Own Heart
for your Great Spirits make you Feel the Love
of the Angelic Host not only for you, but through
you, to all life everywhere.
When the veil of maya first began to unfold
from the consciousness of the mankind of earth,
it was like a wisp of smoke—soon dissipated by
the strong currents of Faith and Hope—and only
to those of Us Who know the power of “conta­
gion” did it presage a future menace to the souls of
men evolving upon the earth. It has been no easy
thing to witness that ever-increasing “fog” that
finally shut away the visible Presence of the Heav­
enly Host and the Music of the Spheres, leaving
the outer consciousness of mankind groping in the
darkness of confusions which result from the
thoughts and feelings of the mass of mankind.
It was when this first contamination of the
innocents began, that I offered to become the Pro­
tector of the soul light in the hearts of men—the
Defender of the Faith that keeps the spirit mov­
ing onward despite the appearances that seem to
prevail . . . Century after century have I woven
the energies of My Life into fanning the fires of
Hope in the breasts of the evolving race, cutting
away the weaknesses of the outer self, and Believ-
15
16 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
ing with all the energy and momentum of My
Being, in the goodness inherent in every man.
In the full Freedom which I enjoy, I am en­
abled to watch the soul Light within the heart
of this entire evolution, as well as the Angelic,
Devic, and Elemental Kingdoms, and wherever
the Light dims, the shadows encroach upon the
happiness of the heart—there I AM, Instantly!
Without vision, the people perish, but I say also—
without Faith—they cannot survive to the Eternal
Day when the Cosmic Angel of the New Dawn
draws back the remaining curtain of maya and all
men see the Kingdom as it exists now—as it al­
ways was—and as it ever shall be—only increasing
in Perfection with every pulsebeat.
Faith in God
I would like through some dear friends to
convey the Faith in the Power of God which is
mine to give. A man who accepts this could walk
on the water . . . could stand in the fire unharmed
. . . could summon the dead to rise . . . the blind
to see . . . the lame to walk . . . because all these
appearances are resultant from Faith conveyed
through feeling into a distorted image and given
life by some lifestream . . . Thus can the life be
withdrawn from such an image by One who has
Faith that God has greater power than the ig­
norant outer mind which created the shadow form
in the beginning. Let us arise and experiment
with this Faith . . . and let Me show you what My
Feeling in your Faith can do.
17
Magnetic Power of Faith
Do you know what is the Activity of Defend­
ing The Faith of an entire evolution—Angelic,
human and elemental? That is My Service to Life
in this Universe, and if that one Quality were
removed from the consciousness of any intelli­
gence, the cohesive power that holds it in form
would immediately be neutralized and the indi­
vidual indentity itself cease to be!
There is a Magnetic Power of the Heart of
God Itself within the Quality of Faith that draws
to the lifestream that substance, activity, mani­
festation and form into which such an one invests
the Faith of his own Life Essence. Man has had
Faith in human beings, in systems of caste, in
religous orders, in political machinations, in mystic
talismen . . . and—according to the nature of T hat
in which the Faith of man was voluntarily vested—
did the lifestream reap a harvest of smiles or
tears. . . .
Millions of unhappy men and women have
Faith in the communistic doctrines promulgated
by depraved human beings and, through free will,
no man may deny another the power to invest
his Faith according to his particular choice and
design. But life .. . itself . .. through the long and
relentless course of years and centuries . . . even-
18
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 19
tually teaches the consciousness of the Power of
Faith, the Discrimination necessary to determin­
ing wherein that Faith shall be invested . . . and
the H ope that Faith in God Alone will bring the
nature and feeling and manifestations of God
into the individual world of the one so choosing
to Believe in T hat Supreme Power . . . working
through individuals, true . . . but T hat PowerI
SupremeI MasterI AllI
As this pulsation of Faith is an integral part
of the life of every man, every woman, every child,
it became My Service to Guard that Feeling, even
though invested wrongly, that the capacity to feel
Faith might never die. This has been a large order,
for man has experimented so with the feeling of
Faith . . . in his long search for happiness . . .
and so often reaping a harvest of disappointment,
bitterness and tears, has sworn to “never believe
or trust again” . . . And here . . . from the Octave
of Light Eternal, I have Always Entered the
Scene! Better to have loved and trusted and
found the object of affection lacking, than not to
have nurtured the capacity to trust at all . . . for
the momentum grows, even in dis-illusionment,
and one who is capable of “believing” when the
strong shoots of his Faith are finally tied into
God’s Own Blazing Heart makes a track of Flame
over which the Answers to Every Call may ride
triumphant into the heart of the Faithful One.
Faith is one of the most contagious of the
Qualities of the Godhead.
The Angels’ Feeling of Faith
I stand within The Flame of Immortality
which is alive within your physical heartbeat! I
k n o w the power within that Flame! There is no
other power that could act, except for your en­
dowment.
Centuries of acceptance of "other” powers that
limit, distress, annoy and bind, have builded
momentums of fear and uncertainty into the
consciousness and feeling world of the race. Man
lives under the constant threat of the shadows of
his own imagining—energized by his own feelings
and magnetized by his own life back into his world
of experience, a boomerang over which the thrower
no longer has conscious control or intelligent di­
rection!
The acceptance of My Faith in the All Power
of God is the open door to peace of mind, purity
of soul, and perfection of body and physical affairs.
Man cannot accept this Faith by effort of human
will, for this but intensifies the tensions that rise
from effort to please and to become . . . Man
can accept My Faith as he accepts the warmth
of the physical sun, the refreshing breezes that re­
store vitality after the oppression of the heat of
the day . . . I am as capable of transferring My
Feeling of Faith in the All Power of God, as the
so
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 21
least of the sons of men are in conveying the feel­
ing of annoyance or discontent. However, man is
accustomed from centuries of sympathetic vibra­
tions, to tune into the feelings of discord with
which he is surrounded, and he must be trained to
tune in consciously to the vibrations which He
desires to manifest as a Teacher of men! To live
with the Angels, first one must endeavor to accept
Their Feelings, and then to incorporate those feel­
ings into the vibrations of each hour’s living, and
then the sensitivity of the lesser to the Greater
makes inter-change of discourse, of promptings,
of nature, the natural activity of the daily life!
The Endowing Power of Your Faith
The conviction of the outer self as to the power
of God to act Instantly is what I desire, above
all other gifts, to convey to mankind through
some one who desires, as much as I, to conduct
that Truth into the feelings of the people. The
Beloved Jesus embodied that conviction in his
entire ministry and approached every evil appear­
ance with the conscious knowledge and confidence
that there was no power that could act in the
Presence of God. . . . Had he once acknowledged
any other power, His Mastery would not have
manifested . . . even over the appearance of death!
This realm of “psychic horror” is merely the
creation of mankind’s own distortions of thought
and feeling. It is man made, not God made, and
thus—thank the Lord of Mercy and Life—it is not
eternal! Its very name implies its source “the
psyche or the mind” . . .
Out of the realm of imagination, the indi­
vidual wove the substance and form of every
shadow that lives within the circle of his aura,
upon the energy of the God-self. These are vam­
pire creations, fed by the conscious or unconscious
endowment of the soul. . . .
While the ten billion lifestreams that belong
to earth’s evolution are allowed to pursue their
22
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 23
individual and collective weaving of the veil of
maya, we shall have a “psychic realm,” no matter
how constantly we dissolve the creations of each
day, each month, each year. . . .
Whether wearing a garment of flesh, or func­
tioning in the lighter garments provided for the
sojourn between earth lives, the individual is en­
dowing life with form and substance and power!
Now, We are endeavoring to surround certain,
chosen individuals with the Canopy of Our Full
Gathered Cosmic Momentum of Understanding,
Light, Purity and Faith, so that each such one
may “find himself” without the pressures of the
mass accumulations flowing through the Cathedral
of His Soul’s Aspiration! . . . hoping that the
Feeling of the Power of the God Flame through
the heart may be conveyed by the Free Sons and
Daughters of The Brotherhood powerfully enough
to become the predominant feeling of the aspirant.
Faith is the most contagious of all God Qualities
. . . and fear the most contagious of all human
qualities.
If you will be so kind as to call for My Pres­
ence, and the Presence of the Angels of Faith,
to enfold every lifestream who endeavors now
to come out from the shadows of individual mis-
creations, we shall prove that those who “Trust
in the Power of the Lord God” shall see manifest
through their every experience the Supremacy of
That Power. Man, eager and desirous of finding
24 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
individual security, safety, and peace, will come
again to rest on the Bosom of That Presence
Whom We love so well and Whom We live to
serve—and to represent to life everywhere!
'
Instantaneous Response of the Sacred Fire
When one loves from the Flame within the
Heart, that love endures through all the countless
aeons of time, for that Flame is the only consecu­
tive, eternal consciousness of any lifestream—
here or hereafter! The longer We have loved,
the stronger is that Flame, and the greater the
momentum of its magnetizing currents that draw
the consciousness and senses of the Beloved up­
ward, away from the pressures that connect the
outer self with the world of form!
Oh—when mankind learns what a joyous ex­
perience it is to Love for the very happiness of
loving, with no thought of return, then will the
evolution of the race proceed with great speed. . . .
The evolution of an Angelic Order is so rapid,
the progress of the Divine Spark moving like light­
ning through the receptive consciousness of the
Blessed Holy Ones, that it requires tremendous
patience working with the slow moving mass con­
sciousness of human kind. I like Instantaneous
Action. Of course, I know nothing less in My
feelings, but I have the advantage of seeing the
Light go into action the instant the thought is
coupled with feeling, and even if the outer sub­
stance moves slowly, it does not have that tendency
25
26 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
to depress that comes when one, working inside
a flesh body, must depend on Faith rather than
vision to see the Light L e a p F o r w a r d in answer
to the call.
The Protecting Presence of the Angels
At certain points on the earth’s surface there
are concentrated tremendous spiritual currents.
These spiritual currents are guarded by groups of
the Cherubim and Seraphim. Through Cosmic
Plan, these spiritual centers have been created and
maintained to hold the balance of pure life forces
requisite to sustain the solar system. At other
points humanity has evolved great souls who
have taken physical incarnation and, through self-
conscious invocation, have drawn and established
spiritual currents in the environment in which
they have lived and loved and prayed.
From these spiritual centers, Light is constantly
radiating in a manner similar to the physical sun
and it is the privilege of the Cherubim and Sera­
phim to enfold these spiritual centers in Their
radiant ring of protection to prevent them from
being dissipated by the emanation of the earth
people.
The more attention that can be given to the
Cherubim and Seraphim and Their service in sus­
taining the God Currents, the greater will be the
reserve of spiritual forces concentrated and eman­
ating therefrom.
When the currents become intense enough,
the human veil is dissolved and anyone entering
27
28 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
within these spiritual foci may see quickly into
the Octaves from whence Perfection comes. This
has been done at Lourdes and is often done in the
Retreats when students are admitted into the Holy
Ground which has not been defiled by human
thoughts and feelings.
Master Power of Love
I always stand in such reverence and honor
before the Magnetic Power of Pure Divine Love
which is its own protection against intrusion of
anything unlike itself, and is also its own assur­
ance of the Presence, in exactly the perfect loca­
tion, of every person, place, condition and thing
within the world and affairs of the one who has
become That Love i n c a r n a t e .
By Love the Power of God externalized The
Universe! By Love each Sun and every planet
was projected forth, just “so far” and no further.
By Love each system of worlds is held within its
own orbit while the entire universe itself rushes
forward through space . . . and not one small
satellite is dropped from Its perfect place in that
lightning-like sweep of the star-studded Mantle
of God as all move toward a Destiny and Goal
known only by The Father Himself, and intui­
tively felt by His Children who live but to serve
in His name. . . .
In My particular and individual service to
Life, I have enjoyed the protection and power of
Love and have come to such a great understanding
of what that little understood quality really means.
It is Mastery in every sense of the word. To enter
the astral realm, at the call of life . . . I answer
30 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
the magnetic pull of Love (whether it is embodied
in a prayer for the dead, by priest or people, or
whether it is a call from the discarnate lifestream
itself which pierces through the astral matter and
is picked up by one of the Angels Who serve in
this unhappy realm). When the call to My Life
comes, it is love of Life or Comfort or Peace that
prompts the call. I answer because I Love to
fulfill My reason for being. I answer by the
Power of Love, because it was Love of God that
gave Me intelligence—free will—and an opportun­
ity to grow in Light.
Through the light of My Heart and your
Heart, We do create for you through this appear­
ance world Now a Pathway of Love, Peace,
Comfort, Opulence, Illumination and Well
Being, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual!
Will you Feel the Light of your Heart creating
this Path before you leave your room each morn­
ing, and walk in Way of the Angels—through
the day—and in the same security as though you
passed through one of the Rays which have been
made a permanent pathway through the substance
of the earth by the Masters?
Pathway to God
Beloved Children of God:
Do you know how I love you? Can you Feel
the Power of My Devotion to your life, knowing
as I do, from this Octave, the limitations in which
you are endeavoring to unfold Our God Plan?
Yet, in Mercy, I must hold back the Fullness of
that Love in order that your Own Light may
expand and become your Pathway back Home.
No man, nor Angel, nor God can make the
Path on which the emancipated spirit rises except
that One, because the Path issues out of the Heart
Flame of the individual. I Am fortunate, how­
ever, in that the Cosmic Law has allowed Me to
dwell within your Heart Flame, and so with every
individual endeavor which you make to send forth
the Pathway to your Freedom, I, too, send forth
a Lifewave from My Heart and widen that Path­
way by My Love.
If man could know that every step he takes
through the journey of experience in the human
octave and beyond the veil is created and pre­
pared by himself, through the projection of his
own energies out of the primal substance of his
own Light, he would not build so many “cobble-
stoned roads” but rather the soft green paths
31
32 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
where his feet would find Comfort and Ease and
Peace as he pursues his individual way.
I have come to make your Pathway easy, and
as you are endeavoring to Be a Comforting Pres­
ence to Life, the Essence of your own life which
pours out from your sweet hearts will create for
you a beautiful Pathway of Light, and My Love
will help you to melt every stone and obstacle
long before you come upon them. Remember that
My Life Flame flowing through your hearts can
only flow when you make the initial impulse, lest
I do for you what you yourself must do, to become
a server in His Kingdom.
When I reach the side of a soul in distress, the
Love of my Heart is a living stream of elec­
tronic energy which is My “shield and buckler”
—My Ring-pass-not—so that I move in the world
of shadow but am not of it. The Love from
My heart holds the soul imprisoned silent and
in his own orbit, until I can weave from the
substance and energy of My Life the action of
the Flame that sets him free. The electronic
light (responding to My thought form and
the command of My feelings) becomes the
action of the Flame—sword or spear or whatever
the requirement may be . . . and the response of
the electronic light to My command is the Love
in the universal light substance to obeyl The
shadows of lusts and passions that are the chains
binding the soul and making it to writhe in agony,
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 33
close in the Light of God, and at My command . . .
that imprisoned life Loves to respond and throw
off the mantle of suffering and become again the
energy of perfectly expressed harmony . . . for the
soul loves to be free.
You will see as you move forward Loving your
opportunity and your service how the hearts of
men will Love to respond to your endeavors to Be
a Representative of the Angelic Host at this time.
The Song of the Heart
Well Do I Hear the Voice of Your Hearts!
Do you know that the Voice of the Flame within
the Heart is clearly distinguishable to One who
Loves you, even through all the Music of the
Spheres which accompanies the joyous expansion
of God’s Creation. The Song of the Heart carries
within It the melody of the Keynote, and what­
ever the message might be that is conveyed in
the Voice of the Flame, even before We are aware
of the content of the message, We are aware of
the fact that Our Beloved is calling to Us and
the Flame within Our hearts rushes to answer that
callI
You have often heard the expression that "the
heart sings” and this is literally true. In the par­
ticular service to Life which comes under My
Direction, the Angelic Host is in closer contact
with the mankind of earth than is usually the case,
and those Angels who serve with Me are trained
early in their evolution to listen to the messages
of the heart, as They sweep through the lower
atmosphere of earth, as well as through the astral
realm. Then, they are enabled to answer the heart
call with the assistance requested. My Angels are
“heart attuned.” . . .
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 35
When the inner consciousness is functioning
through the physical body, the Voice of the Flame
within the Heart becomes clear and distinct—
especially through a chela who is conscious of
Our Realm and knows how to send up the call
to Us. When the body is sleeping, the heart flame
just ‘hums” the keynote of the lifestream but no
particular message goes forth. However, passing
through the atmosphere, We are often attracted
by the gentle music of sleeping human beings, rec­
ognizing the keynote that flows out from the body
in this song, even as the soft colors of the feeling
body make the aura around the relaxed form, and
Wc often stoop to kiss the brow of such a sleeping
one, who is not aware of Our Presence.
Now, as the attention of the students is being
placed on the Power of the Sacred Fire anchored
within the heart, We expect to hear that Voice
of the Flame with Great Power, and We shall
answer it with exceeding joy!
The One Pointed Nature of Angelic
Consciousness
Every Angelic Being belonging to the Court
of Heaven and serving God through radiation
embodies some Specific Radiation, Quality, Virtue
or Positive Feeling which is One of the manifold
expressions of the Nature of Divinity! Century
after century—age after age—aeon after aeon—each
such Being has drawn the stream of primal life
essence which forms the core of the Individual
Flame and qualified that essence with the pre­
dominant feeling of His Own Natural Virtue!
Mankind, unlike the Angelic Host, were orig­
inally designed to manifest a “twelve fold” nature,
similar to that of the God Father and Mother
of the system to which They belong. Thus you
will see that the power of a particular Quality
is much more concentrated through the Nature
and Being of an Angel than even through the most
advanced and matured nature of a member of the
human kingdom, where the qualified energy fills
twelve Virtues, instead of one!
The nature of the Archangels, the Seraphim,
the Cherubim, and the Angels is One Pointed in
the extreme . . . and They represent concentra­
tions of Particular God Qualities which—like Suns
36
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 37
—fecundate the germs of like Qualities through
the souls of mankind wherever The Divine Ones
minister.
I Am privileged to represent the Cosmic Qual­
ity of F a i t h in the All Power of the God that flows
through and animates every physical heart, that
feeds the soul of every lifestream, incarnate or dis-
carnate, that belongs to this evolution. It is My
privilege and opportunity to convey My Faith
through the feelings to those who open themselves
to My Presence and My Power. People have
Faith . . . but it is not anchored in God . . . it is
anchored in the shadows of their own creation.
It is for Me to radiate Faith in God as the only
power that can act. It is My hope that some among
the human race at present will so invite My Pres­
ence that I may F i r e the consciousness with My
Conviction and enable them to bear witness to
that All Power, stimulate interest in His King­
dom, and bring that Kingdom through the outer
consciousness into manifestation for this planet
in these years of planetary change.
The Home of the Heart
I come, this morning, into the atmosphere of
earth, from the Heart of Our Celestial Home in
the Realm of God’s Own Purest Heart, to abide
within My Home in Your Pure Hearts. Is it not
beautiful, that in whatever Sphere we choose to
abide, a Heart of Love awaits us to be the Chalice
of Our Presence. How truly expressive is that
expression of men—"Home is where the Heart
Isl" My Home is where Your Heart isl And I
know you shall come to know Your Home is Where
My Heart Is.. ..
My Heart is with the children of men, all over
this small earth—it is with the dear souls in the
realms that await incarnation—it is with the Sons
of Heaven in every sphere—-Truly, in Love—the
Universe is the Home of One who Loves1
I have swept through the lower atmosphere
where many earth-bound lifestreams have been
struggling to free themselves from appetites and
passions that have bound them, preventing their
enjoyment of the higher Heavens, and in the
soul anguish of such a spirit, felt an invitation
to make My home within that straining heart!
I have walked the dusty roads of earth, and found
an invitation to make My home in the breast of
38
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 39
many a humble and despairing pilgrim on life’s
way. After abiding just a little while with them,
they were able to find the anchorage of their own
I AM Presence and go forward to greater accom­
plishment.
Ah, the Children of Heaven who walk the
pathway of earth as Messengers of Shamballa are
ever responding to the call of the heart light
within all life—“Abide with me—” and always,
We must answer! This morning I Come to Abide
In you forever, and you must abide now in the
life of all that call to you that Your Presence may
give them life more abundantly.
Preparation of the Aura for Visitation
When it has been said that the Master, the
Christ Self, or The Presence has been forced
to temporarily “withdraw” from a discordant in­
dividual, I do not believe the full import of that
has been impressed upon the outer consciousness.
Any Being or Focus of God Intelligence who has
become One with the Will of God has consciously
dedicated All His Life Energies to fulfilling the
God Plan. He has, therefore, voluntarily relin­
quished the right, so called, to animate or moti­
vate discord for any reason whatsoever.........
In the case of Those Who have signified to
the Cosmic Tribunal that They are willing to tie
Their energies into the hearts of unascended
beings, it is, of course, impossible to ever again
disconnect the lifestream completely, but the
Master cannot remain within the aura of the
Beloved unless complete harmony reigns. He,
rather, directs His energy to The Beloved.
Your aura is determined by the length of the
rays precipitated from your thought and feeling
centers. Your sphere of influence is expanded by
your self conscious activities in the Light. You
can well see the responsibility of your great
Hearts, for many people live within the personal
40
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 41
atmosphere of your mental and feeling worlds.
When I am enabled to enter right into your bodies,
and animate those auras from within, it becomes
the Cosmic Wings of Light that has a planetary
control of energy through Love Divine.
The Seven Archangels
Michael
Raphael Uriel
Gabriel Chamuel
Jophiel
Zadkiel
It is not the plan of the Archangels to abide
within flesh forms, nor to bind Their Shining
Spirits in the forgetful robes of flesh, in vehicles
designed, created and sustained as suitable housing
for another type of evolutionary spirit, whose Fire
and Light are tempered to these garments.
When the Central Sun of a System takes the
Cosmic Initiation and is vested with the power
to create a Minor Galaxy (seven suns with their
planets and satellites) three Evolutionary Intelli­
gences are given an opportunity to develop and ma­
ture—the Angelic, the human, and the elemental.
The infinite details of drawing forth and
peopling the various suns and planets is the work
of a lifetime of recording, and could not be con­
tained in the pages of a letter, but the over-all
picture, perhaps, will help you. . . .
Those Intelligences within the Central Sun
who form the Children of the Central Sun are
known as the Archangels. They are already in
42
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 43
complete possession of the God Power of The
Father-Mother of the Galaxy and They live to
radiate the Light that fills the system and forms
the effulgent atmosphere of God’s Heart. When
each lesser Sun is sent forth in the rhythmic out-
breathing of the Central Sun (each rhythm taking
countless centuries of time) Seven of the Arch­
angels with Their Twin Flames go forth to be­
come the Guardian Presence of all the Angelic
Beings, mankind, and the elementals who will
form the evolution of that sun and its planets. I
(Michael) came forth with our present sun, to­
gether with the other six Archangels who form
the Guard, not only of the earth, but the physical
sun, the planets of this system, their satellites,
and the Seven Inner Spheres which form the
Heavens for this particular chain.
Coming from the Central Sun, it is within Our
natural heritage to rise into the chains above Us,
as occasion demands, and the Cosmic Highways
into the Heart of Our System are open to Us at
all times, whereas the lifestreams evolving toward
perfection on the earth chain alone are bound
by the periphery of the chain to which they belong.
With Us from the Central Sun came Our Own
Guard of Honor, and countless legions of Angelic
Beings whose Purpose in Being is to fulfill Our
Will, which is one with the Will of the Father.
Then, added to this countless legion, are the An­
gelic Beings who have “evolved” and are “evolv­
ing” from within the chain itself and who join
44 BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL
Our ranks from time to time, as the Liberated
Members of the human race join the Great White
Brotherhood. As Sanat Rumara is to The Great
White Brotherhood, so am I to the Angelic Broth­
erhood (forgive the personal reference). The
reason I speak of it is because the Activity of the
Archangels is diversified in the extreme, covering
the fields of healing, illumination, and protec­
tion, but the joining of the Angelic Kingdom to
the Emancipated Brotherhood of Mankind is My
particular service to Life.
As Saint Germain, through the Seventh Ray,
will draw the Angelic Host and the mankind of
earth into conscious cooperative action through
the beautiful rituals of the Ceremonial Ray, you
will see how We all work with This Plan, you
from among the human race . . . I from the An­
gelic Kingdom . . . and the Beloved Saint Ger­
main from the Ascended Master Kingdom—The
Trinity again . . . in action . . . to fulfill God’s
Plan.
Besides the Angelic Host drawn forth by
Helios and Vesta, who are evolving within the
Inner Spheres, there are countless legions of
Angels evolved through the Free Spirits of Those
who are engaged in Cosmic Unfoldment . . . as
Saint Germain’s Angels of the Violet Flame,
created and sustained by His Own Love and Light,
and there are many God Created Angelic Beings of
My Own household, drawn forth and sustained by
My Love.
The Angel of Deliverance
I have been called “The Angel of Deliver­
ance" because the Quality of My lifestream is an
A c t iv it y that causes immediate freedom to mani­
fest when It is accepted by the outer consciousness
of mankind.
Through the centuries, I have been pictured
sweeping through the distorted atmospheres in
which imprisoned souls desired deliverance, and—
through the Power of My Flaming Sword—I have
released them from bondages of hell and purgatory
into places of Light and Peace! This Activity is
true and My service for twenty hours out of the
twenty-four is engaged in serving in this astral
realm, which includes the lower atmosphere of
earth in which mankind incarnate function, as
well as the invisible realm where the discamates
abide.
But, My service now is to train those life-
streams who have professed an interest in assisting
to prepare the earth for its Initiation at the close
of this twenty-year cycle, so that they may stop
contributing to the chains and bonds that fetter
the soul and blind the senses and smother the God
Powers of the lifestream which must be called
forth NOW to give assurance and confidence to
the mankind of earth.
45
46 BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL
I can render this service through R a d ia t io n
where I Am invited to do so! The radiation of
the Ascended Masters, Ourselves, or your indi­
vidual Presence is as R e a l as the Light and warmth
of the physical sun, hut man must “go to meet it“
to enjoy Its Gifts and Powers. Man is so attuned
to picking up the radiation and vibrations of
discord, that it requires a definite application on
the part of the individual to tune out of the vibra­
tory action of the “world thought“ and make him­
self receptive to the finer vibrations which We
offer so freely, but to the one who will experi­
ment with stilling of the self, and with the in­
viting of Our Presence, We will C o m e !
Into the deepest recesses of your secret and
sacred hearts, I speak the Words of Truthl
In the beginning, We had One Consciousness
which embodied the Truth of Life and the Love of
God and the Power of Individual Creative En­
deavor by which every idea and thought received
was capable of externalization on the instant!
When you chose the path of incarnation, that
Consciousness came with you, and in those early
centuries we were no more separated than when
we all dwelt in the Bosom of the Father of
Light. Through the centuries, the veil of human
thought and feeling entered your consciousness
and finally the time came when the outer self
was no longer cognizant of Our Oneness and Unity
in Purpose, Design, Heart and very Being.
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 47
Can you then imagine My Jcy as your present
consciousness Accepts Me—when again I Am al­
lowed to bring the Consciousness which Is Ours,
not Mine alone, to you. Gradually this will super­
sede the consciousness you have accepted of a
human heritage and birthright and you will as­
sume the glorious freedom o£ the Angelic Host
and the confidence and power in your own mo­
mentum which will flash forth like Fire and ac­
complish that whereunto it is sent.
How often you stand with Me in the Heart of
the Inner Realms, and Watch the Flaming Power
of Directed God Energy as it flashes forth from
My Heart, swirls around a lifestream caught in
the shadows, burns away the tentacles of human
creation, and frees the soul. Then, to one of the
Angelic Host is given the joyous opportunity of
taking the soul into Its Arms of Light and rising
with It into a Sphere where happiness and free­
dom provide the spiritual climate necessary for the
evolution of the soul.
48 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
Excerpts of Addresses
of Our Lord
Maha Chohan
I want to speak, too, on the Kingdom which
is so dear to My Heart . . . that of the Angelic
Host . . . They who, like the Elemental Kingdom
are voluntary exiles from the Heart and the Bosom
of God.
They live but to love, and They know no un­
kindness. It is inconceivable for the consciousness
of beings belonging to this evolution to accept the
thought of gain at the expense of another.
When the Angelic Host was called forth after
the Elemental Kingdom, Their service was to cre­
ate a canopy of consciousness, which was the ema­
nation and radiation of Their own Life and Light,
over the lifestreams of the human race who were
to embody upon the planet.
The Elemental Kingdom first created the
planet in habitable form. Then came the Angelic
Host, before any human being set foot upon it,
and the nature of the Angel’s evolution is very
beautiful. Angels, like men, grow and mature
and wax strong. When They are small, They just
absorb God’s Life and Light, in the same manner
that your body absorbs the sunshine when you lie
exposed to its rays, and that feeling of warmth and
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 49
well-being fills Them and then They may join a
group Who are working with a Master—and the
Master seeing the Quality They have absorbed
sends such a group forth to a place where Their
particular quality of Confidence, or whatever
Quality is lacking in the lower atmosphere of
earth is needed. These little Beings fly in some­
thing like your goose formation, with a Being of
directive capacity at Their head, and Their efficacy
in the service depends on how long They can
hold that Quality within Them until the bless­
ing is released and the location is bathed in that
essence.
They are often taken to places to witness the
service of Their elder brothers and sisters. Now
let us take a service in a great Cathedral—not to
go into a lengthy dissertation—a congregation
made up of individuals in a great city. Through
timing, the Master in charge—particularly Jesus at
devotional services—knows when that group will
be gathered together, and at the elevation of the
Cup at every Service a group of these Angels is
sent right into the Church. They stand in “V”
formation with either a great Seraphim or Cheru­
bim of mature proportion right over the altar,
and then at the given moment when the Priest
utters the sanctified words, from Their bodies
They release freely, and in very great power, that
Spiritual Anointing from Above. Now in the
smaller churches throughout the city and country
less experienced Angelic Beings gather and the
50 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
release is sometimes too rapid, because every angel
has to work with the whole to make the tremen­
dous power of ceremony as efficacious as Saint Ger­
main in the future intends to manifest.
If I were to ask a group of chelas to breathe
in and retain that breath, and breathe out at a
given moment, each one’s own development would
determine if he could await the cosmic moment.
So the smaller Angels experiment in places
where less numbers are gathered, but where there
are great groups gathered together we send groups
of the Angelic Host every thirty minutes to re­
lease the substance which flows down through
the people. Above the Angelic Host are Mighty
Devas who guard Our Temples and Churches and
World Movements. They receive the life force
much like the Beings in the Temples, and They
hold that within Their bodies sometimes for five or
six thousand years, and when you step into a great
Church, you are just bathed in that sanctity and
that holiness, and you take it away with you;
but were such a Deva to release that force, your
old Cathedrals, like Rheims, would not have the
particular radiation they do now. Some of these
foci go back as far as Atlantis.
Certain members of the Angelic Host have
to learn that in the drawing of the substance
is such joy and happiness, to regulate it carefully
in its release, to weigh Their blessings and not
to let them go forth uncontrolled, is to grow in
Grace, in Power, in Light, and Mastery.
The Realm of Bey
Fair as the Morning Star that shines through
the uncertain light between the dark and the
daylight, is the glorious Realm of Bey. It is a
great Cosmic Activity similar to the Love Star
and occupies a place in the Solar System as a focus
of the Power of the Cherubim and Seraphim.
In the Realm of Bey countless numbers of the
Seraphic and Cherubic Host dwell and in the
Heart Center of this Realm is a castle such as
no fairy Prince ever conceived, and there dwells
the Lord of Bey, Serapis, and His Mighty Brothers.
From this Realm there pulsates constantly a
radiating power and pressure of Peace. The wings
of your attention and the love of your spirit may
take you there until you drink deeply of the
Waters of Peace and find your outer garment an
Open Door through which gifts from the Realm
of Bey may flow to all.
M
The Seraphim
The Realm of the Seraphim is a Realm of
Power and the Beings known as the Seraphic
Guard are beings of tremendous physical stature
and the most concentrated strength that the planet
earth has yet known. Their faces and bodies are
exquisitively beautiful, and there is a line in the
chin that denotes tremendous strength and deter­
mination.
When the Seraphim are chosen to guard any
particular Activity or individual They are like
concentrated lightning. The angels who guard
the entrance to the Garden of Eden are such
Beings.
The Seraphic Host work closely with Hercules
and they have always overshadowed the great
men of power who have worked for good through
the centuries.
The Seraphim and Cherubim are created from
the Heart of the Solar Logos Himself. In His
thoughts of Cosmic Life and Love They spring
forth from the Flaming Heart of God as indi­
vidual self-conscious life, and They are number­
less.
You may visualize a Flaming Heart in the
Bosom of the Great Central Sun and see coming
forth from that Glorious Bosom the individual
52
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 53
Presence of a Seraphim and Cherubim. When
the call of a self-conscious Flame of God goes
forth, sometimes the Seraphim and Cherubim are
newly created to fulfill that call and sometimes the
already individualized Beings answer the fiat.
The Seraphim are great Beings from six to
fourteen feet in height. They are the Guardians
of spiritual forces and are always active with the
Elohim in the building of planets and spiritual
centers on various globes. They are more often
masculine than feminine and They are impersonal
in Their concentrated powers of protection. They
move in groups of seven, which is always the
number denoting creation and of each seven
Seraphim one is the Leader who moves in the
foreground with the three pairs spread out in the
shape of a “V” behind Him. When the Seraphim
move through the heavens or the earth sphere,
They emit a white Light and many a falling star
and shooting comet that has been recorded by
science is but the speedy progression of a group
of Seraphim through the upper air.
Excerpts of Addresses
From T he Ascended
Master Saint Germain
The Angelic Host and the Seventh Ray
As the Ceremonial Ray begins to increase Its
Pressure through the lifestreams of those who
have been privileged to “lay the foundations” for
the New Order, designed according to the Will
of God, the conscious cooperation between the
Evolutions that are moving upward in a parallel
rhythm will become increasingly evident to the
spiritually alert.
The Angelic Host, delegated to the realm of
song and story for the most part by the material­
istic mind of the twentieth century, will again
become an Accepted Reality, and the curtain of
maya that has so long separated mankind from
these Beautiful Beings who have been their unseen
but ever-present companions and guardians
through the centuries will be melted away by
the love, the faith and the assurance of the mem­
bers of the human race who are privileged to assist
in this pioneering work of a spiritual nature.
Sensitive individuals are rising here and there
who have the developed spiritual natures required
to contact Members of this Kingdom, and they are
54
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 55
putting forth their findings in books and lectures
which confirm to the students of the Spiritual Law
that such a Realm and such Inhabitants do exist,
and that communication with Them and conscious
cooperation and service with such a Kingdom
is not only possible but is, even now, a fact. Here
and there, where such individuals or groups can
be found, the first pulsations of cooperative en­
deavor between the Angelic Host and mankind
are already setting a pattern which one day will
be the accepted “fashion” of the spiritual day!
The following “excerpts” describe such an
experiment, and may be enjoyed by any group or
any individual willing to so prepare themselves that
their life energies and their personal and collective
harmonies are such as to warrant the coming of
these lovely Beings into their worlds and auras,
with the resulting stimulation of the spiritual na­
ture of the human kind, and a similar practical
progression which is afforded the Angelic Kingdom
through association with the soul and conscious­
ness of those ascending the ladder of evolution
through the human kingdom.
The Coming of the Cherubim to Philadelphia
December 1952
From Celestial Heights of Perfect Peace, Beau­
ty and Ever-Expanding Perfection of every kind,
the Cherubim have come, to abide—consciously—
within your auras, and to bring again that sense
of Brotherhood between the Kingdoms of The
Angelic Host and that of mankind!
In the early ages, when mankind first walked
the earth, the glorious cord of electronic life
energy which connected each one with the God
Presence, was far wider than the physical garment
he occupied, and This Light formed The Path
between the Kingdom of Heaven and the Kingdom
of earth, over which the directions of the Presence
flowed, and across which the Angelic Kingdom and
the Guardian Master could pass freely into the con­
sciousness of the people and into the actual sub­
stance of the world of form.
Thus the glorious Bridge from the human to
the Divine was world wide, and there was no sepa­
ration and no disconnection between the world
of God and the world of man. It is this glorious
estate We are endeavoring to restore, and it is My
particular joyous service to Life to bring, wher­
ever opportunity affords Me the privilege of doing
so, an understanding between the Angelic and
56
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 57
human kingdoms, and a loving cooperation in
unified service to God and man.
I was enabled to secure the dispensation re­
quired to bring some of the lovely members of the
Cherubic Hosts to dwell with you, with the under­
standing that once each month I would have to
attend each one to see if it were kindness to allow
the lovely Being to remain longer in such associa­
tion. The Lords of Karma promise Me that if we
prove successful in this experiment, that I shall be
allowed the honor of bringing more of This King­
dom into the lower atmosphere of earth around the
magnetic heart centers of Love which specifically
qualified students may provide. We shall see!
You know We often smile at the casual accept­
ance of a dispensation, or a service rendered by a
Member of Our Kingdom to the student body,
who consider all endeavors to assist mankind con­
sist of a mere “perfunctory wave of the Hand of
the Master” by which—with no expenditure of
thought or feeling—manifestations, miracles and
marvels occur. Yet, this concept is at absolute
variance with the training, discipline and self mas­
tery that is required of Us to secure this Free
Estate. Everything We do in any kingdom re­
quires the use of Our concentrated faculties, the
expenditure of Our vital Life Force, the contribu­
tion of Our creative centers of thought and feeling,
and the dedication of Our attention and interest.
Although it is a joy to be called into action and—
in fact—even to be recognized as capable of per-
58 BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL
forming the services that are incorporated in your
decrees, I cannot refrain from reminding you
that “sweeping the Violet Flame through you”
for instance, requires that Your Presence and
the Master addressed, in courtesy and delight at
the opportunity to serve, must stop whatever He
is doing for a moment, and direct the energy
of His Life to that service. Then, for the most
part, the student is so delighted that he has “made
the call” that he never thinks to thank the One
who has oftentimes paused in the middle of a
Cosmic Conference, or in the creation of a Star,
to respond to that call.
For Christmas, thought I, I should Love Ex­
ceedingly to give the blessed chelas a particular
gift of Love! Thinking of you, turned My attention
toward your city, and with the Inner Sight I saw
re-vivified the Beautiful Cherubic Temple. The
Great Dome of the Temple was rounded and shone
in the Light of the Spiritual Sun, and countless
thousands of Cherubic Beings hovered around it,
like lovely honey bees cluster around sweet flowers.
Great ribbons of Light pierced through the golden
atmosphere, and, like searchlights, poured out in
every direction, and, along these ribbons of Light
Angelic Beings walked—as you walk today along a
path made up of the substance of earth. As I
looked, Lord Michael came by, and He said to Me
“What a beautiful sight! Why don’t We ask
if We might restore it through the student body?”
“Exactly!” I replied—“this shall be Our Christmas
BELOVED ARCHANGEL M ICHAEL 59
Gift from God to the students—if We are enabled
to receive consent to do so at this time.”
As you know, My service to Life is to bring the
Angelic Kingdom and the kingdom of men togeth­
er again, so I had a “reason” that was not purely
personal for approaching the “Powers that Be” with
this request. Prince Michael came with Me, and
We were given the consent to render this service.
Then, I had to secure Cherubim willing to
come, and strong enough to endure the experience,
sweet (?) as it might be! Lord Michael suggested
I take only Angels of the Blue Flame, as They are
used to the strenuous activities within the astral
realm and are more prepared to withstand the im­
pact of the vibrations of human kind.
“No,” I said. “I would like this to be a very in­
dividual gift, and I shall enter the Sphere within
which the Presence and Christ Self of each of these
lifestreams presently abides, study carefully the
Light of the Causal Body, and secure a Cherubim
which represents the Cosmic Quality and Virtue
of the student and the Ray to which he belongs.”
This “survey” took Me no little time, but I en­
joyed every moment of it, and from each Sphere,
I took with Me as I proceeded on My journey,
those little Cherubim which were to soon abide
with you. We made a merry company, the Little
Ones streaming out behind My person, enjoying
tremendously the “visit” to the other Realms than
the ones in which They had previously abided, for
I had secured a Cherubim for each blessed one
60 BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL
whose Light was strong enough to step out of the
old regime into the new. We rode in state, in a
beautiful Chariot of Fire, to the Heart of the Sun
to receive the Blessings of the God Parents on Our
venture. So the “Little Ones” had a Christmas
gift too, before I brought Them to you.
And here, They now abide! Dressed in lovely
shimmering garments of living Light—They do
not labour. They shine—They do not create, They
awaken, and each one represents the God Virtue
which is your particular service to unfold for the
enrichment of the consciousness of all mankind.
I hope you enjoy Them as much as I have en­
joyed bringing Them to you. They live on Light,
and you should see the happiness and joy with
which They enter the Sanctuary to be bathed in
the radiation drawn forth in the class work, for
this is the "nearest” They get to Home! The more
of the spiritual essence that is drawn forth in the
groups, the stronger They grow, and They develop
in size and mature in consciousness, just as chil­
dren do. Will it not be a happy day to show Them
so well grown by next Christmas when I must take
them for a brief journey back to the Sun?
May I, as your Brother, express the gratitude
and blessings of The Ascended Host of Light to
you, individually and collectively, for offering Us
an opportunity to expand the Light of God that
never fails through the atmosphere of earth and
into the consciousness of all peoples!
BELOVED ARCHANGEL MICHAEL 61
Little can the outer mind comprehend the
Activity in Heaven that has been occasioned by
your tremendous calls to Light and Life through
the years, which has set into motion the Hosts of
Light, who, obedient to that call, arc enabled to
render service to the earth unparalleled since the
last Golden Age of Perfection.
It is one thing for the Sons and Daughters of
Heaven to pursue Their Appointed Activities at
Inner Levels, and quite another for the life within
unascended beings to demand the more than or­
dinary intervention and intercession of these
Beings on behalf of mankind and the planet it­
self. Every Master Power in the Universe has
grown and expanded His Light to a far greater ex­
tent than the ordinary course of spiritual evolu­
tion would allow because You—Valiant Defenders
of Light and Friends of Freedom—have demanded
of Their Life certain outpourings which required
that each draw, focus and direct more and more
Light through Their own Lifestreams. Can you see
then how you have contributed to the Evolution of
the Heavenly Hosts? Can you sense then, how We
love you?
And now, Children of the Shining Hearts, I
Am privileged to bring to you the Cherubic Chil­
dren from the Fire Temple, and here—this Holy
Christmas Eve 1952—begins the first pulsation of
The Brotherhood of Angels and Men, walking to­
gether along The Pathway to Freedom, contribut-

ing their joint energies to the awakening and free­
ing of mankind everywhere from all that limits,
binds, curtails or distresses life. This is My Joy—
My Honor—My Delight!
As the Seventh Ray increases in Its Power
through the consciousness of mankind, the Wor­
ship of the peoples will combine the Three Evolu­
tions,—Angelic, human and elemental. Tonight,
We set that Spiritual Pulsation into motion in this
visitation.
I know, Sweet Hearts of The Presence of Life
Eternal, your Feelings as you accept The Divine
Beings who have swept earthward in the train of
Lord Michael’s Great Aura, for one Christmas Eve
—so long ago—I,* too, was entrusted with a Pres­
ence from Heaven, One whose Love was to re­
deem a world from death and sinl I, too, prayed
within the recesses of My Heart, that as the Lovely
Mary was delivered of This One, I might be found
strong enough and pure enough and constant
enough to Be the Protecting Presence of His Holy
Innocence.
Well do I remember the heart pain that I had
not proven worthy enough through My karmic
bonds to provide a shelter of dignity and comfort
for the coming of This One, and yet—in the ex­
quisite radiance which presaged His birth—all was
forgotten except the Peace and Holiness of the
Light of Heaven and the Love of God. . . . So,
St. Joseph! Jesus.

even the simplest heart and spirit, the most humble
abode or tabernacle is graced with a Spiritual
Light that transmutes it into Heaven’s Heart,
when God does choose to there abide!
When I received permission to endow upon
your lifestreams, these Glorious Cherubic Chil­
dren, how happy was My Heart, for I know—
through Personal Experience — the sanctity and
spiritual exaltation of living with a Wholly Pure
God Being, and this I would love you to experience
and enjoy.
The colors of your Causal Body were carefully
studied, and the Flame Temple in which your
Presence and Higher Mental Bodies serve was vis­
ited, and from these Temples I personally chose
a Cherubim for you individually that corresponds
with your natural color, tone and spiritual service
through your own God Ray. For the past week
these lovely ones have abided within your Higher
Mental Bodies, becoming acquainted with the
vibrations of your Spiritual Selves.
May I say that the Cherubic Hosts live in
happiness, laughter and joyous peace. Do not take
such personal responsibility as to make yourselves
tense, because this is an unpleasant vibration to
Their happy hearts. Do the very best you can,
My Children, and I shall come once a month to see
how The Angels fare in the keeping of Their
brothers. If They are happy We shall ask for
greater dispensations to bring more of Them earth-

ward and part the human veil so you may see the
delicacy of Their features, the Radiance of Their
luminous bodies, the perfection of their divine
forms, the golden light of their curling hair, the
heavenly spirit of their luminous eyes. . . .
A joyous Holy Christmas, children—and a
blessed companionship with Heaven’s Own!
