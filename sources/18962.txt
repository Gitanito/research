I was in the United States Air Force I
entered the military in 66 my track my
basic training would have been in San
Antonio from there I went to Altus Air
Force Base in Oklahoma from there to be
at Nam can be at Nam to Greece and was
discharged honorably in Greece and
returned back to the States
this was as you know 30 years or more
ago this happened to now to sell Coahoma
on a sac Air Force Base I was guarding a
b-52 a sac is a Strategic Air Command I
was on guard duty guarding a b-52 bomber
in the bomber area which is divided into
sections with that what we called the
hurry house in the middle and that&#39;s
where the officers and the flight crew
stay on ready if they&#39;re on alert to
disperse through the planes quickly and
on this this would have been like on the
summer of 1967 as the closest sometime
in the summer period there we were on
guard duty
there were I think it like approximately
four planes on each side and the it
would have been at night probably late
midnight to probably sometime in the
morning between that period of time when
over one of the b-52s which were armed
with nuclear weapons there appeared a
bluish haze almost in the form of a
boomerang or a wing shape and in this
haze there was a glittery light we had
no idea what this was and we do know
that the the SAC teams were called to
ready
so they came out of the planes but prior
to that this just hovered over the plane
for a short period of time and it is
vanished
we were told later that it was picked up
on radar it wasn&#39;t as if you actually
saw it glide away it was like like in a
wisp it was gone it covered most of the
wingspan of
b-52 now what what that would be in feet
or meters or anything or that I have no
idea but it was large it was large but
it was also very transparent it was not
a solid mass it was not what you would
think of if you think of a UFO and at
that time we had no idea this was
something that actually showed up on
radar or and the perimeter guard solid
and the other people on the other post
because there&#39;s one person per b-52
bomber really yes and there&#39;s a red zone
around that bomb bomber that you&#39;re not
allowed anyone in it so even even the
guard itself does not go past that red
line so there are other people that saw
it just about it just above it
I&#39;m talking like John no more than 20
feet it was just I mean I&#39;m just above
eye-level
a b-52s high to begin with but when you
looked at it it was just above it the
alarm in the hurry house must have went
off because they they came out to the
planes and what did they do they board
the planes and they start them up and
are ready to taxi to take off whenever
notified there was no there was not a
notification they just started their
engines and then they must have gotten
word we don&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on in
the cockpit but then they shut down the
planes and then they went back in or
shortly afterwards after we had seen it
it had left and that&#39;s when they were
dispersed to the planes the radicular
weapons on the sac base is always ready
for that so because they&#39;re hot rate he
goes yes yes and whether in that area
that&#39;s what they&#39;re loaded for that&#39;s
why we&#39;re guarding them that&#39;s the whole
purpose of not allowing anyone near them
because they were armed with nuclear
weapon we had no idea what it was
I still have no idea what it was other
than it was a mist in the shape of a
boomerang that had glitter in it we&#39;d
never seen anything like this yeah so it
was it was unusual it was something that
that we were mystified by
my flight instructor was looking back to
the northeast in the direction of the
runway and said what is that I deleted
an expletive but what is that and I
looked up in the direction he was
looking and he was looking in the sky
over the runway and
