  		              		Experience Description   

    Traffic accident with head-on collision. February 1979.

 My mother drove a Renault 5 and I was in the back seat. We were on a country road and it was raining. At a turning point, a Land Rover with two older men moved into our lane and we collided. My mother stayed in the car with pneumothorax and head trauma without losing consciousness. I was thrown through the front windshield of the car with a Le Fort III facial / skull fracture with loss of cerebrospinal fluid.  

  I remember seeing from the ground level. There was a black image, like a  silhouette, of a lady who was walking on the road from right to left. She was  calmly, looking down and pulling a shopping cart about 3-4 meters from me. There was nothing else in the experience. I didn't see cars or other people. I only saw the image of the lady who was calmly moving. She did not react to the accident like she was in her own world. I only observed the scene.  
  
  Later, and I think while I was aware of what had happened, I found myself sitting. But I don't know where this was such as would it be in the ambulance? But sitting? I opened my eyes a little and I was next to my mother who was  on my right. I saw her torn skirt and pieces of glass and blood. I didn't look up and I didn't see her face. I just looked down at her skirt and   saw the glass and blood.    I don't remember any more until getting to the hospital.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Do not know.   I was baptized in the Catholic church, but I was 4 years old.  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Uncertain     I don’t think so because I was 4 years old.  

  What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths.   I believe in life after death and that we experience several lives before and after the current one.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I was 4 years old and therefore had no elaborate beliefs.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I remember seeing from the ground level. There was a black image, like a  silhouette, of a lady who was walking on the road from right to left. She was  calmly, looking down and pulling a shopping cart about 3-4 meters from me. There was nothing else in the experience. I didn't see cars or other people. I only saw the image of the lady who was calmly moving. She did not react to the accident like she was in her own world. I only observed the scene.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     The truth that the lady did not seem of this world. Being so close to an accident and not reacting? She was quietly walking with her shopping cart.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown     At that  moment, none. But since I regained the memory of the experience and over the years I have gradually become more interested in the meaning of life, life after life, NDEs, and a better understanding of death, meditation, and our spiritual body and how all this can also be applied to medicine. 
    
    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No. Since I remembered my experience, I have been constantly searching for the Truth all these years of my life, and I continue to do so.    

    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No       

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The memory of the experience emerged after some time ... years later? I do not remember exactly when I became aware of this experience, but I do not think that when I was 4 years old, I was aware of it.  I do not know because  I cannot say it exactly.    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No         

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          What was the point of seeing that lady? She was in her own world.    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes.    Years passed until I remembered and was aware of the experience.        Years passed from the time I remembered it until I shared it with my parents. My father reacted with skepticism, which would be a cerebral reaction. My mother expressed doubts about its veracity.  We did not mention it again. I have mentioned it to other people but they have not expressed any great interest.    

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I do not know if at that time I remembered the experience. But when I became aware of the experience, I was convinced that it had happened. Later, I began to have doubts whether it was real or not. Now I think it was real, but that's why I'm writing to you. It does not resemble most of the NDEs that are described.    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real.     I think it was real, perhaps influenced by my culture and by my great interest in these issues. But I can't offer a 100% guarantee, because it’s not similar to other NDEs.    

    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No       

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I would like one day to get to know more about the experience,  who was that lady, and the meaning of having had this experience.        Perhaps the meaning was to help me develop an interest in spirituality?
