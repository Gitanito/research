  Morse, Melvin, M.D. &amp;   Perry, Paul (1994).&nbsp; Parting Visions&nbsp; Uses and Meanings of Pre-Death, Psychic,   and Spiritual Experiences.&nbsp; New York, NY:&nbsp; Villard Books.

Sample    Stories   from patients, other medical professionals and personal experience round out the   sample from which this information on near-death experiencers have been taken.

  Methodology    Dr. Morse   uses personal experiences that have been reported to him by patients, as well as   reports by other medical professionals to provide him with the research tools   that he uses to write this book.&nbsp; He suggests too, that because these stories   have been reported to him and he has a biased belief in the near-death   experiences that are reported to him in this book, that this may give the   material a 'bent' toward his beliefs.

  Abstract

In this book, Dr.   Morse reports on experiences considered by some to be 'mystical' in nature.&nbsp; He   reports on dreams that patients have had that have foretold their deaths to   themselves and family.&nbsp; He tells of near-death experiences where the experiencer   actually meets long-ago-deceased family members and then come back with   verifiable detail to support their case.&nbsp; He also reports on cases of SIDS and   how, often, the mother or father will have a 'feeling' or 'dream' that tells   them that the infant is going to die even before it happens.&nbsp; Most importantly,   Dr. Morse presents ways to make the end of a loved-ones life full of dignity and   love rather than full of doubt and shame.&nbsp; The chapters covered in the book   include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Visions and   real life, in a new light, the SIDS study, the circuit boards of mysticism   revisited, the secret club, guided by the light, visions in practice, and the   significance of parting visions in everyday life (p.&nbsp; xvii-xviii).'

Important Concepts   and Definitions

SIDS ' sudden infant   death syndrome    Near-death   experience ' an experience where patients have physically experienced death and   then are resuscitated and come back to life.&nbsp; The experiences remembered by   these patients during the clinical death comprise the near-death experience.

  Operationalizations    The   stories reported in this data are of a qualitative nature.&nbsp; Dr. Morse also uses   his personal papers (such as letters and bedside notes) to complete his   experience with patients and medical professionals who report near-death   experiences.

  Major Findings

(Taken from the   chapter entitled, 'Afterword (p. 187-190).')

The chapter entitled,   'Afterword' presents information that the family experiences either as the   result of the death of a loved on or just previous to the loved one's death.&nbsp;   The purpose of presenting these stories is to show that the relationship with   loved ones does not end after death.&nbsp; Additionally, it opens up an interesting   conversation as to the validity of the near-death experience and how death   affects all of the members in a family.

One story presented   tells of the case of a man who recently lost his teenaged daughter.&nbsp; Someone   began contacting him at his office with an 'urgent message'.&nbsp; When the woman   finally contacted the father, she said that his daughter had 'something to show   him'.&nbsp; The father figured that she was some malcontent that had read about the   death of his daughter in the paper and wanted money. But then he ran into   someone who had been friends with his daughter.&nbsp; She told him that she had a   dream about the deceased girl and that there was a message in the deceased   girl's room for the father. At some point not long after this incident, the   father went into the daughter's room-not his usual practice since the death of   the daughter.&nbsp; In the room, he found a poem written by her prior to her death.&nbsp;   The poem contained information as if she knew that she was going to die.&nbsp; It   told the reader that she was in a better place. &nbsp;All of this information   comforted the father reading it and enabled him to come to terms better with the   death of his daughter.

Dr. Morse also   presents information about the SIDS study.&nbsp; He says that 25% of the parents who   have children who died of SIDS report having a premonition of some type   indicating that the infant was going to die.&nbsp; He presents that there is   something 'primal' in the brain of humans not ordinarily activated that has the   ability toward things like this, of a mystical nature.

All in all, this book   presents a good case for the psychological connection between family members.&nbsp;   Many family members are presented as knowing when a person in the family will   die because they are given advanced warning.&nbsp; Other cases presented in the book   illustrate these connections by the family member knowing just previous to their   death that they will die.&nbsp; These family members are then able to say goodbye in   such a way as to bring others in the family peace with the death.    </font></body>
