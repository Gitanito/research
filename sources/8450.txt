        Eadie, Betty J. (1992).&nbsp;   Embraced by the light.&nbsp; Placerville, CA:&nbsp; Gold Leaf Press

  Sample    The sample   reported in this book is a single one:&nbsp; Ms. Eadie herself and her experience   with near-death

  Methodology    Ms. Eadie   presents her own account of a near-death experience she had as the result of a   medical complication.

  Abstract

Ms. Eadie strives to   present accounts of her life before, during and after her near-death   experience.&nbsp; She was an ordinary house wife in the Midwest one minute, a patient   in a hospital the next, experiencing a near-death experience the next, and then,   finally, experiencing the aftermath of her near-death experience in the final   chapters of the book.&nbsp;

Chapters included in   this book are:&nbsp; 'The First Night, The night Deepens, The Second Day, My Death,   The Tunnel, Embraced by the Light, The Laws, Healing-and Dying, The Looms and   the Library, The Garden, The Greeting Party, Many Worlds, Selecting a Body, The   Drunken Man, Prayer, The Council of Men, The Farewell, My Return, My Recovery,   and My Special Angel.    The   account of Ms. Eadie's experience of what life is like after death is   particularly vivid and involved.&nbsp; She seems to have come back to life with much   detail about the after-life.&nbsp; What her experiences endeavor to teach the reader   is that there is an afterlife and a reason why Ms. Eadie was resuscitated:&nbsp; to   share the word of the beings in the afterlife about the love that connects all   in this physical existence and the afterlife.

  Important Concepts and Definitions    Near-death   ' in this account, near-death is defined as a physical death brought about by   medical complications.&nbsp; This death was affirmed by the hospital.&nbsp; The   experiencer was then 'brought back to life' through medical resuscitation   efforts.

  Operationalizations    This   account of a near death experience is qualitative in nature.&nbsp; It is a   self-report of a near-death experience encountered by the author.

  Major Findings

Ms. Eadie describes   how the near-death experience affected her family in the two final chapters of   the book.&nbsp; These chapters are entitled, 'My Recovery (p. 131-134)' and, 'My   Special Angel (p. 135-147).'

It seems that   immediately after Ms. Eadie coming home from the hospital, she sank into a   depression.&nbsp; She wanted to go back to the afterlife presented in her near-death   experience.&nbsp; She was no longer afraid of death and in fact longed for it to   happen.&nbsp; She was unable to communicate with her family.&nbsp; Eventually, she   realized that this was unfair to her family and reeked of self-pity.&nbsp; She forced   herself to go on with life in the way that her family needed her to.&nbsp; She was   able to salvage the relationships that she had neglected during her depression.&nbsp;   Ms. Eadie's family was described during the depression as, 'wonderfully   supportive (p. 131).'

About six years after   Ms. Eadie's near-death experience, she and her family decided to take in a   foster baby.&nbsp; The baby had been with the Eadie's for ten months when the family   decided they wanted the baby back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Eadie prayed that the baby would be   returned, and then finally resolved to pray for the baby's happiness.&nbsp; Soon   thereafter, a messenger from her near-death experience visited her.&nbsp; He told her   that the baby would be returned.&nbsp; After a two-week time period, Ms. Eadie was   contacted about the baby.&nbsp; The family had badly abused the baby so the child was   again removed.&nbsp; Ms. Eadie was offered custody of the child and the family   eventually adopted the child.    The   effects of the Eadie family as the result of Ms. Eadie's near-death experience   seem to be positive.&nbsp; While at first, Ms. Eadie was not able to go back to being   the wife and mother that the family needed, the provided her with emotional and   physical support until she could.&nbsp; The family also received the blessing of an   additional child as the result of Ms. Eadie's increased role in charitable   activities in the community.&nbsp; While both of these experiences were tainted with   a certain amount of tragedy, the overall result was that it further cemented the   family bond and overwhelmingly made the family a stronger, happier unit. </font></body>
