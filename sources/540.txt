 The British College of Psychic Science which published Psychic Science was begun in 1920, largely through the efforts and support of James Hewat McKenzie (1870-1929) and his wife, Barbara.  Until vol. 14, 1935, this was called Quarterly Transactions of the British College of Psychic Science.  In December 1938 the College was amalgamated with the International Institute for Psychical Research to form the International Institute for Psychic Investigation.  After the war, this in turn became the Institute for Experimental Metaphysics.  On Bond (1864-1945), who edited the journal until October 1926, see the note under Survival.  He was succeeded by Stanley de Brath who edited the journal until April 1936.  The journal was the premier exponent of the value and importance of parapsychology in the years between the Wars, with news on developments in the field, extensive book reviews, and lengthy review articles on specific topics (like poltergeist phenomena).   It carried full-page prints of psychic phenomena (like ectoplasm) and of leading researchers and mediums.
