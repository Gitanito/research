National Spiritualist College· and National
Joint Education Scheme.
(Uflde-r the auspices of the S.N.U. and B.S.L.U.)
During the rec~nt A.G.M. the Joint Education
Committee met and decided that examinations in the
Entrance Examination and Intermediate Grade shall
he. held in March each year. .
Candidates for the Intermediate Examination can-.
not be accepted unless they hav~ passed either the
B.S.L.U. Grade V or the Entrance Examination. So
it is hoped that as many· Church ·members and Sub-:
scribing members of the S.N.U. as can manage it will.
sit for the Entrance Examination next March, so that
a large number will be eligible for the_ Intermediate
Examination in 1928. . .
As the Regulations state that .~he Entrance Exami-
nation must be equal iil difficulty to that for. Gi:ade
V, and as what was decided had to be decided.
quickly, the ·committee resolved that the Grade V
Syllabus should be adopted for th~ 1927· Examina-
tion, with the B.S.L.U. Handbook. ~~o. 8 (7d. post

SYLLABUS FOR THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION.
(Candidates must be at least 18 years old on lsf March, 192'1.)
(a) A study of the various phases of mediumship from an
evidential standpoint, leading up from the vario11s Grades,
viz. : (i) trumpet phenomena ; (ii) levitations ; (iii) material-
isation; (iv) spirit: photography; (v) automatic writing."
(b) A Rt11dy of medinmRhip; and the philosophy of Spiritualism ·
religious, ethical, philosophical). ·
(c) The effects of ·Spiritualism on Science, Philosophy and
'Religion. ·
(d) The various phases of opposition to Spiritualism, and a
study of vario11s methods of mPPting them, viz., religiou1,
materialistic·and agnosfic opposition. ·
The time allowed' far the Examination is ·a hours. · ·
Students may complain that the time allowed in the namina-
tions ia not sufficient, 88 it does not: allow them to say aa much
88 they could in answer to the questions. But al! students
sh9uld !;>ear in mind that the questions are not set: to dr11w out
au they .know (and that would not be much, if five questions
could draw it ail out), but to test their ability to aelect, from
what they know, sutlicient to give a convincing answer in the
time at tneir cti~po~al. '!'hat is the real test of eith~r a SP,eal!:.er
or a teacher: not the quantity, but the quality of wnat they tell
us, and the time they take to tell it. So the s~udent should
practise durmg the year answering questions under strict
examination conditions. ·
. '.l'he Commltt!'e has realised that inany, who otherwise would
take up the Education .Scheme, are unable to do so be<;Q.use of
the dirliculty of finding Tutors, or of arr1µ1.ging .mid-week
classes; and also that many who are competent cipiritualists
would gladly act as Tutors it they only knew how to set about
the task. '.L'o meet these di.llicu1ties the following hmts have
been dr11wn up, and it is hoped that the result will be a great
~crease in the number of students and of candidates sitting at
the examinations.
· The Lesson Plan has been drawn up primarily for
classes meeting under a tutor, or for groups ot stu-
dents who stuay together or "tutor" each other, but
the "solitary student'' who pr~cures the questionr
for previous examinations and. follows the nmts on
answering questions will find them of great benefit
and will be assisted in answering those set by the
Examiner.· If study begins in mid-August each
Handbook article wul have b~en studied once before
C.bristmas, and the rest of .the time until the Exjlm-
ination can be devoted to revision work and to re~d,..
ing the books recommended. Noteii pearing on the
subjects set in the Syllabus co11ld be taken for re~
reading and reference. Practical experience is. $
great asset.

The following suggestions ·are offered to students, 'to h!llP
them in their work:- ·
'(i) Take the questions s.et: at the prev~ous exams. (SE\6 March·
BANNER. for 1922-26). Make each qu.c;istion .th!' subject -0f an
essay; look up the matter of it (in No. 8 handbook, etc.) and
make notes· on it; then write the essay. Read it through, and
strike out the non-essentials; only· keeping matter strictly
relevant :to the subject. Practice writing ·an essay in three-
quarters of an hour (the time allowed per answer at the exam.).
(ii) Study each (lrticle in No. 3 Handbook thoroughly, care-
fully and repeatedl'y. Take SOME LEADING ~ENTE~CE cir
section; make it the subject: of an essay, and writ.e your
" answer " from the matter of that chapter; ·s.upplement~d bY
your knowledge from other sources. The subject for STUDY,
showll for .each week of the above pr.igramme, would make
ex~ellent subjects for essays.
(iil) lte!!d ES$AYS .ON REASONING. Note the secfi:ons
dealh~g with our Movement; and also make use of the logical
1r.ethcids ·explaiiled, ~h~ writing your es.says. _
·now TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.
FirRt, read the questions carefully, and find out EXACTLY
WHAT' you are being uked to do. The different -kinds of.
queRtions fhat may be asked are given under in CAPTTAL
LETTERS, and the type of answer required is given after.
1. (a) If you are asked FOR FACTS AND DETAILS, only,
(A) Put down the farts and details as you would tell them
to an inquirer who asked you the same question.
(b) Tf asked FOR OPTNTONS, only,
('R) FirRt state your opinion and fhen state your reasons for
holdinsr the opinion. Al'l'nnp:e yonr answer so that ea<'h opinion
will arise from the pre<'edinir one and lend to the followina: one.
Keep yonr strongest argument to the last-so as ·to " clinch "
your answer.
(c) Tf asked FOR FACTS AND OPINIONS,
(C) State firRt yonr fart11 and !hen your .oniniom1. showinir
how fhpRe oninion11 _are j1111tified by the facts. ALWAYS proceed
from fn<'ts to oniTtion11· and ren11on11. ,
(cl) Tf n11ked TO DEAL GENERALLY WITH A WHOLE
SUR.TECT,
(rn GivP the p:enPrnllv known and l'"Cepted farts and of'inion!I
on the subject-ADDING original facts and opinions of your
own.
(p) Tf aRkPd TO C.O TNTO DETAILS ON SOME PARTl-
CUT,AR part of a snbject,
(F.) 1'1-rana:e yonr :dPtnils so as to make them interesting,

.all thnt von know for and a!!'nim1t both; point out (h) where they
al!'ree and (r) where t.hpv difl'er: anil frl) then give yonr own
o..,ininm1; nON'T aive whnt von KNOW of nne !ind what you
TlHNT\ of' the of'her, or whnt von know in f'nvotrr of one. and
what vnu know a!!'nini1t thP other, as this is not only unfair and
misleadinp: hnt utterly foolish. •
8. Never nmrw.er 'MORE thnn yon nre asked. Che<'k yourself
by rPnrlinp: the question at intervals whilst writing your answer.
NOTE.-The e"ll:nminers can jndire your knowledge in only
one wav-from what von sav (or don't say) in yonr an"W"l'S. So

derstand your subject, and 'will give you few, if any, marks.
