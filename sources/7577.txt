As I fell toward the ground in the space of what might have been two minutes, it is as though my whole life was compressed and replayed in the blink of any eye. I remember two or three distinct images of the whole experience and the rest was just a blur. It was as if my mind was operating in two spaces, in one part, I was trying to control the helicopter, and in the other, I was having the playback experience. In the logical part of my mind I had come to the realization that if the wind shear situation did not abate, I would crash and be killed. In a distant and disembodied way, I was wondering if it would be painful. During the event, I was not afraid. It was only afterward that I felt fear and relief.
