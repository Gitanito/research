I was in a coma for three weeks, double pneumonia, total respiratory failure, intubated, and a medically induced coma. During this coma, I remembered nothing when I awoke except that a man approached me and took me by my right arm and stated, 'Walk with me'. When walking he stated to me 'Your job is not finished, you must go back.' This experience occurred in a total white area - as the inside of a Ping-Pong ball. During this period of my coma, the doctor had told my wife to expect the worse, as they could do no more. At one point during the coma (I believe coincides with my experience), I began a miraculous recovery as stated by my doctors. The doctors were calling me the 'Miracle Man'. Within a week, both my lungs cleared totally. I spent the entire month of October 2009 in the critical care unit followed by two and one half months of physical therapy.

This experience has changed my life and has made me a stronger Christian. I would love to share my experience with anyone who is interested.
